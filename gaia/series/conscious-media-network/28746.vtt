00:00:01.108 --> 00:00:03.028 line:15% 
<v ->I sat with a man named Kenny Johnson</v>

2
00:00:03.028 --> 00:00:06.488 line:15% 
in front of a waterfall discussing Zen philosophies.

3
00:00:06.488 --> 00:00:08.108 line:15% 
Kenny had found peace while serving

4
00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.288 line:15% 
what was to be a 40-year prison sentence

5
00:00:10.288 --> 00:00:12.088 line:15% 
after a life of crime.

6
00:00:12.088 --> 00:00:14.488 line:15% 
It came while in meditation with Gongaji

7
00:00:14.488 --> 00:00:17.286 line:15% 
who was working for a non-profit organization

8
00:00:17.286 --> 00:00:20.025 line:15% 
to bring compassion to the life of those incarcerated.

9
00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:24.359 line:15% 
(low beat)

10
00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.169 line:15% 
<v Regina>You sit here today the picture of peace.</v>

11
00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.429 line:15% 
(laughs) However your youth brought something

12
00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:37.829 line:15% 
entirely different by way of your experience.

13
00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.789 line:15% 
Let's talk a little bit about your background first.

14
00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:42.809 line:15% 
And how you entered this world,

15
00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.610 line:15% 
that you later had to emerge from.

16
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.109 line:15% 
<v ->Okay.</v>

17
00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:54.129 line:15% 
I guess the earliest memory I can have

18
00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.226 line:15% 
of my childhood was coming from Arkansas.

19
00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:00.876 line:15% 
Let me back up, what happened was,

20
00:01:00.876 --> 00:01:03.676 line:15% 
when I was a little boy, I loved candy, you know.

21
00:01:03.676 --> 00:01:06.136 line:15% 
And there were these two girls, Peaches and Pumkin

22
00:01:06.136 --> 00:01:09.256 line:15% 
and we always went to school together, you know.

23
00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:12.276 line:15% 
And so I said I want to impress the girls you know

24
00:01:12.276 --> 00:01:14.096 line:15% 
look at this guy you know and so,

25
00:01:14.096 --> 00:01:16.056 line:15% 
grandma had a little coinpurse

26
00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:17.656 line:15% 
that I knew where it was.

27
00:01:17.656 --> 00:01:19.016 line:15% 
And I would sneak under her pillow

28
00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:20.656 line:15% 
and get some silver.

29
00:01:20.656 --> 00:01:22.876 line:15% 
I didn't know the value of money.

30
00:01:22.876 --> 00:01:24.956 line:15% 
And I would go to the store and I would buy some candy,

31
00:01:24.956 --> 00:01:26.516 line:15% 
and I would give it to them, and we would

32
00:01:26.516 --> 00:01:28.096 line:15% 
catch the bus to school.

33
00:01:28.096 --> 00:01:29.276 line:15% 
<v Regina>To Peaches and Punkin?</v>

34
00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:30.946 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah to Peaches and Pumkin and I loved that.</v>

35
00:01:30.946 --> 00:01:32.276 line:15% 
<v Regina>(laughs) That's so cute.</v>

36
00:01:32.276 --> 00:01:33.656 line:15% 
<v ->So one day...</v>

37
00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:36.716 line:15% 
there was no change so I took a green bill.

38
00:01:36.716 --> 00:01:40.536 line:15% 
Gave it to the storekeeper,

39
00:01:40.536 --> 00:01:44.356 line:15% 
and he gave me back all this money, I said (gasps)

40
00:01:44.356 --> 00:01:47.016 line:15% 
I was caught red-handed.

41
00:01:47.016 --> 00:01:50.056 line:15% 
Cause I was like, "Uuh, I don't know what to with all that."

42
00:01:50.056 --> 00:01:51.436 line:15% 
I said, "Give it to her."

43
00:01:51.436 --> 00:01:53.696 line:15% 
So it was a 10 dollar bill, something like that.

44
00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:55.336 line:15% 
So he gave all the money to Peaches,

45
00:01:55.336 --> 00:01:57.236 line:15% 
and she told grandma.

46
00:01:57.236 --> 00:02:01.556 line:15% 
And all of a sudden grandma became real cool toward me.

47
00:02:01.556 --> 00:02:04.616 line:15% 
And then next thing I know she says, Kennydale...

48
00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:06.556 line:15% 
Whenever I hear Kennydale I'm in trouble.

49
00:02:06.556 --> 00:02:08.396 line:15% 
(laughter)

50
00:02:08.396 --> 00:02:09.616 line:15% 
<v Regina>You heard it a lot.</v>

51
00:02:09.616 --> 00:02:10.936 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah, right.</v>

52
00:02:10.936 --> 00:02:14.496 line:15% 
And so she said I'm sending you to your mother, you know.

53
00:02:14.496 --> 00:02:17.676 line:15% 
Just out of the blue, surprised and shocked.

54
00:02:17.676 --> 00:02:19.896 line:15% 
And I love my grandmother so I was like,

55
00:02:19.896 --> 00:02:22.436 line:15% 
"Oh I don't want to go." But I was torn from her

56
00:02:22.436 --> 00:02:25.197 line:15% 
and sent to Kansas City, Missouri on a bus by myself.

57
00:02:25.197 --> 00:02:27.176 line:15% 
With a little name tag.

58
00:02:27.176 --> 00:02:28.956 line:15% 
My mother picked me up, and I was led to

59
00:02:28.956 --> 00:02:30.976 line:15% 
Kansas City, Missouri.

60
00:02:30.976 --> 00:02:33.156 line:15% 
And that's when everything started happening.

61
00:02:33.156 --> 00:02:35.256 line:15% 
<v Regina>You were I assume.</v>

62
00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:36.936 line:15% 
<v ->Arkansas, I was Star City, Arkansas.</v>

63
00:02:36.936 --> 00:02:38.546 line:15% 
<v Regina>You were missing your grandmother</v>

64
00:02:38.546 --> 00:02:39.496
and wondering why.

65
00:02:39.496 --> 00:02:40.226 line:15% 
<v ->Why.</v>

66
00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.296 line:15% 
<v Regina>Did you have any feeling or understanding yet</v>

67
00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:43.436 line:15% 
about why this had happened?

68
00:02:43.436 --> 00:02:45.336 line:15% 
Why she was upset with you?

69
00:02:45.336 --> 00:02:47.876 line:15% 
No, no, my grandmother, my mother

70
00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:49.756 line:15% 
you know they didn't talk to us kids.

71
00:02:49.756 --> 00:02:51.016 line:15% 
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

72
00:02:51.016 --> 00:02:52.476 line:15% 
<v ->So they did things without us knowing</v>

73
00:02:52.476 --> 00:02:54.556 line:15% 
why they were doing them, and then explain it to us.

74
00:02:54.556 --> 00:02:55.636 line:15% 
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

75
00:02:55.636 --> 00:02:58.236 line:15% 
<v ->So this is my first time of wanting to be understood</v>

76
00:02:58.236 --> 00:03:00.536 line:15% 
or wanting some explanation.

77
00:03:00.536 --> 00:03:02.496 line:15% 
But she didn't talk to me.

78
00:03:02.496 --> 00:03:05.496 line:15% 
You know, I did like I said earlier.

79
00:03:05.496 --> 00:03:09.236 line:15% 
Not being seen, just okay I'm gonna take this kids to you.

80
00:03:09.236 --> 00:03:12.796 line:15% 
I get to Kansas City, and my other siblings,

81
00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:15.276 line:15% 
my sister, and my brother Memio,

82
00:03:15.276 --> 00:03:18.256 line:15% 
and my step-father, this guy who I don't even know,

83
00:03:18.256 --> 00:03:19.956 line:15% 
cause I never knew my father.

84
00:03:19.956 --> 00:03:24.956 line:15% 
And I was confused.

85
00:03:25.916 --> 00:03:28.096 line:15% 
The city, cars, all these people,

86
00:03:28.096 --> 00:03:33.096 line:15% 
so what I did, I discovered AMP Supermarket.

87
00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:37.034 line:15% 
And they had this long aisle of candy.

88
00:03:37.034 --> 00:03:38.634 line:15% 
(Regina laughs)

89
00:03:38.634 --> 00:03:40.434 line:15% 
I said, "Oh, I'm gonna have it."

90
00:03:40.434 --> 00:03:41.694 line:15% 
(Regina laughs)

91
00:03:41.694 --> 00:03:43.194 line:15% 
And I had a little old green army coat

92
00:03:43.194 --> 00:03:46.601 line:15% 
with a little fur collar and I was fill my pockets up,

93
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.141 line:15% 
and walk out the store, and its like

94
00:03:48.141 --> 00:03:50.821 line:15% 
I was eating candy, but I said, "I'm in heaven.

95
00:03:50.821 --> 00:03:52.691 line:15% 
(laughs)

96
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.181 line:15% 
<v Regina>Now I think at this point</v>

97
00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:56.601 line:15% 
almost everybody can relate to that as a child.

98
00:03:56.601 --> 00:03:57.701 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah (laughs)</v>

99
00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:59.581 line:15% 
<v Regina>The only time I ever stole something was</v>

100
00:03:59.581 --> 00:04:02.001 line:15% 
at the five and dime and it was a piece of candy.

101
00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:04.201 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah. (laughs)</v>

102
00:04:04.201 --> 00:04:06.101 line:15% 
And then one day I got caught, you know,

103
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:08.301 line:15% 
They took me to the back, emptied my pockets out,

104
00:04:08.301 --> 00:04:10.241 line:15% 
and said, "Don't come back here anymore."

105
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:12.861 line:15% 
And so I didn't for a while.

106
00:04:12.861 --> 00:04:16.481 line:15% 
But by that time, I realized I was looking for

107
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:19.422 line:15% 
a crowd to hang out with.

108
00:04:19.422 --> 00:04:21.001 line:15% 
And the crowd I was looking for was

109
00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:23.921 line:15% 
guys that felt like me, acted like me.

110
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:27.081 line:15% 
Because my mother and my step-father,

111
00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:30.421 line:15% 
they just didn't talk to us, they beat us and chastise us,

112
00:04:30.421 --> 00:04:31.641 line:15% 
but they wouldn't sit down and

113
00:04:31.641 --> 00:04:33.181 line:15% 
just have a conversation with you.

114
00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:34.621 line:15% 
Like you and I are having.

115
00:04:34.621 --> 00:04:37.862 line:15% 
And to explain life to us, to explain what they're doing,

116
00:04:37.862 --> 00:04:39.381 line:15% 
explain where we join.

117
00:04:39.381 --> 00:04:43.081 line:15% 
I never got that, so I was just like invincible in a sense.

118
00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:46.139 line:15% 
But these young guys who are like myself,

119
00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.179 line:15% 
they were thieves or hoodlums.

120
00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:51.459 line:15% 
These guys they brought me in to their world.

121
00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:55.920 line:15% 
And so I said, "Great." So we would go steal fireworks

122
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.640 line:15% 
or steal cupcakes off the Frito Lay truck.

123
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.036 line:15% 
The Best Pop trucks, we would steal boxes,

124
00:05:05.036 --> 00:05:08.116 line:15% 
the guy would go to deliver the pop to the store,

125
00:05:08.116 --> 00:05:10.016 line:15% 
we were waiting, watching in the bushes,

126
00:05:10.016 --> 00:05:12.116 line:15% 
and go in there and just (growls) grab the pop,

127
00:05:12.116 --> 00:05:14.397
run off to the park, drink pop all day long.

128
00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:17.377 line:15% 
So it was that type of crowd I started hanging out with.

129
00:05:17.377 --> 00:05:19.816 line:15% 
And I realized it was exciting, it was fun.

130
00:05:19.816 --> 00:05:22.016 line:15% 
<v Regina>You're sweet tooth was being satisfied.</v>

131
00:05:22.016 --> 00:05:23.917 line:15% 
<v ->My sweet tooth was being satisfied,</v>

132
00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:27.096 line:15% 
and I had a camaraderie with other kids my age.

133
00:05:27.096 --> 00:05:30.616 line:15% 
And so that's how I started to gravitate towards

134
00:05:30.616 --> 00:05:34.891 line:15% 
that type of world or

135
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:37.271
group of kids that saw me.

136
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:38.571 line:15% 
That the way I can say that.

137
00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:40.052 line:15% 
<v Regina>So you belong to something.</v>

138
00:05:40.052 --> 00:05:42.371 line:15% 
<v ->I belong to something, and most kids</v>

139
00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:44.671 line:15% 
want to belong to something, if they don't

140
00:05:44.671 --> 00:05:49.631 line:15% 
if the grownups don't try to bring him in.

141
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:52.232 line:15% 
Then to the initiation into whatever,

142
00:05:52.232 --> 00:05:55.122 line:15% 
then they have to go get initiated by somebody.

143
00:05:55.122 --> 00:05:57.642 line:15% 
And so I got initiated by the wrong crowd.

144
00:05:57.642 --> 00:05:59.921 line:15% 
Which in reality was the right crowd.

145
00:05:59.921 --> 00:06:02.842 line:15% 
And I was there for about 30 years in that type of crowd.

146
00:06:02.842 --> 00:06:03.641 line:15% 
That type of..

147
00:06:03.641 --> 00:06:05.192 line:15% 
<v Regina>And what kind of things did</v>

148
00:06:05.192 --> 00:06:07.842 line:15% 
stealing pop and candy start progressing into,

149
00:06:07.842 --> 00:06:10.841 line:15% 
and how are you feeling through the progression,

150
00:06:10.841 --> 00:06:12.581 line:15% 
so it's two questions in one as you take this...

151
00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:14.662 line:15% 
<v ->Well I regressed into...</v>

152
00:06:19.582 --> 00:06:22.442 line:15% 
stealing cars, joyriding, you know.

153
00:06:22.442 --> 00:06:25.022 line:15% 
So now we're I'm moving up to, we get a car

154
00:06:25.022 --> 00:06:26.722 line:15% 
we hot wire it, we put the wires out,

155
00:06:26.722 --> 00:06:28.502 line:15% 
put some aluminium foil around it,

156
00:06:28.502 --> 00:06:30.242 line:15% 
and start the car, let's drive down the street,

157
00:06:30.242 --> 00:06:32.242
90 miles an hour, just joyride it.

158
00:06:32.242 --> 00:06:35.062 line:15% 
And that led to a juvenile home.

159
00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:37.102 line:15% 
And I would go to the department stores

160
00:06:37.102 --> 00:06:40.682 line:15% 
and steal shirts and jackets, and things like that.

161
00:06:40.682 --> 00:06:44.221 line:15% 
Because we were so poor, I couldn't afford to buy anything,

162
00:06:44.221 --> 00:06:47.222 line:15% 
so I'd ask my momma, "Can you get me this?"

163
00:06:47.222 --> 00:06:49.181 line:15% 
Can you get me some skates, can you buy me,

164
00:06:49.181 --> 00:06:53.402 line:15% 
a new leather coat, but she couldn't do any of those things.

165
00:06:53.402 --> 00:06:55.462 line:15% 
So I had to find some way to get things

166
00:06:55.462 --> 00:06:57.322 line:15% 
that all my peers had.

167
00:06:57.322 --> 00:06:59.702 line:15% 
And so I said, lets go to the department store

168
00:06:59.702 --> 00:07:01.462 line:15% 
and steal t-shirts.

169
00:07:01.462 --> 00:07:04.202 line:15% 
Back then, it was a bad line shirt.

170
00:07:04.202 --> 00:07:05.061 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

171
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:06.371 line:15% 
<v ->And I just loved those shirts,</v>

172
00:07:06.371 --> 00:07:09.742 line:15% 
I would get some popcorn, empty the popcorn out,

173
00:07:09.742 --> 00:07:13.342 line:15% 
eat it up, and then fill it up with badline shirts

174
00:07:13.342 --> 00:07:15.402 line:15% 
(laughs)

175
00:07:15.402 --> 00:07:16.742 line:15% 
<v Regina>Oh you were bad.</v>

176
00:07:16.742 --> 00:07:19.221 line:15% 
<v ->I put some popcorn on top I got one back. (laughs)</v>

177
00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:20.831 line:15% 
<v Regina>I hope you didn't have it buttered.</v>

178
00:07:20.831 --> 00:07:22.961 line:15% 
<v ->No (laughs)</v>

179
00:07:25.481 --> 00:07:29.501 line:15% 
and how did I feel, I felt pretty good.

180
00:07:29.501 --> 00:07:33.901 line:15% 
There was no guilt until my mother would catch me

181
00:07:33.901 --> 00:07:37.242 line:15% 
then she would you know, beat me of course,

182
00:07:37.242 --> 00:07:40.221 line:15% 
and those beating were pretty severe.

183
00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:44.062 line:15% 
Because she was trying to beat the devil out of me.

184
00:07:44.062 --> 00:07:44.962 line:15% 
<v Regina>Right.</v>

185
00:07:44.962 --> 00:07:45.702 line:15% 
<v ->Literally.</v>

186
00:07:45.702 --> 00:07:46.922 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

187
00:07:46.922 --> 00:07:49.241 line:15% 
<v ->And you know, through the word of Jesus,</v>

188
00:07:49.241 --> 00:07:51.169 line:15% 
through the word of the book, take us to church,

189
00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:53.359 line:15% 
Sunday, Wednesdays, and Saturdays

190
00:07:53.359 --> 00:07:57.220 line:15% 
and have us participate in all the church activities.

191
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.879 line:15% 
Trying to get me into the word,

192
00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:00.319 line:15% 
and doing little plays.

193
00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:02.759 line:15% 
So that's how I was able to start having

194
00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:05.749 line:15% 
some type of

195
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:08.379
consciousness about guilt,

196
00:08:08.379 --> 00:08:09.157 line:15% 
through the church.

197
00:08:09.157 --> 00:08:10.057 line:15% 
<v Regina>Mmhhmm.</v>

198
00:08:10.057 --> 00:08:12.076 line:15% 
<v ->And yet I was so excited with the guys</v>

199
00:08:12.076 --> 00:08:13.796 line:15% 
I was hanging out, it would wear off so quick

200
00:08:13.796 --> 00:08:15.417 line:15% 
after I get out of church, matter of fact,

201
00:08:15.417 --> 00:08:18.136 line:15% 
while I'm in church, I would go down

202
00:08:18.136 --> 00:08:21.776 line:15% 
during the intermission, before the preacher

203
00:08:21.776 --> 00:08:23.317 line:15% 
would come with the long sermon,

204
00:08:23.317 --> 00:08:25.876 line:15% 
I would run down to the doughnut shop

205
00:08:25.876 --> 00:08:27.156 line:15% 
and steal doughnuts and pop.

206
00:08:27.156 --> 00:08:29.296
(laughs)

207
00:08:29.296 --> 00:08:31.017 line:15% 
<v Regina>Wow you're sweet tooth was getting you</v>

208
00:08:31.017 --> 00:08:32.176 line:15% 
in some trouble.

209
00:08:32.176 --> 00:08:33.756 line:15% 
<v ->It was all kinds of, so the sweet tooth</v>

210
00:08:33.756 --> 00:08:36.076 line:15% 
really got me into a lot of trouble, but

211
00:08:36.076 --> 00:08:39.637 line:15% 
I was able to satisfy it (laughs)

212
00:08:39.637 --> 00:08:41.337 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah you were able to satisfy it,</v>

213
00:08:41.337 --> 00:08:42.656 line:15% 
you had your own needs.

214
00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:44.076 line:15% 
<v ->I had my own needs to satisfy them.</v>

215
00:08:44.076 --> 00:08:45.557 line:15% 
<v Regina>So you go into juvenile hall,</v>

216
00:08:45.557 --> 00:08:46.557 line:15% 
<v ->Yes.</v>

217
00:08:46.557 --> 00:08:50.177 line:15% 
<v Regina>Now does this experience start changing anything,</v>

218
00:08:50.177 --> 00:08:52.916 line:15% 
or is this more of a reinforcement for you?

219
00:08:54.416 --> 00:08:58.701 line:15% 
<v ->Once I went to juvenile hall, and was able to come out,</v>

220
00:08:58.701 --> 00:09:02.731 line:15% 
with my manhood intact, I said,

221
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:04.161
"Ah" I could go to jail

222
00:09:04.161 --> 00:09:07.075 line:15% 
subconsciously I knew I could go to jail and survive.

223
00:09:07.075 --> 00:09:09.315 line:15% 
Once I knew that, once anybody know

224
00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:11.455 line:15% 
that they can go to hell and come back,

225
00:09:11.455 --> 00:09:13.974 line:15% 
ah okay then, I can keep doing,

226
00:09:13.974 --> 00:09:18.874 line:15% 
so it only reinforced my ability to steal.

227
00:09:18.874 --> 00:09:23.080 line:15% 
Because I wasn't abused or beat up,

228
00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.946 line:15% 
I wasn't treated how a lot of guys were treated

229
00:09:24.946 --> 00:09:27.786 line:15% 
so I survived it so I realized its not a big deal,

230
00:09:27.786 --> 00:09:29.217 line:15% 
there was no fear anymore.

231
00:09:29.217 --> 00:09:30.686 line:15% 
<v Regina>So you had no fear of jail?</v>

232
00:09:30.686 --> 00:09:31.587 line:15% 
<v ->Right</v>

233
00:09:31.587 --> 00:09:33.027 line:15% 
<v Regina>Now let me ask you during this</v>

234
00:09:33.027 --> 00:09:34.877 line:15% 
whole people of time, how old were you by this time.

235
00:09:34.877 --> 00:09:35.887 line:15% 
<v ->uh 15 or 14.</v>

236
00:09:35.887 --> 00:09:36.907 line:15% 
<v Regina>15.</v>

237
00:09:36.907 --> 00:09:37.866 line:15% 
<v ->Mhmm.</v>

238
00:09:37.866 --> 00:09:39.656 line:15% 
<v Regina>Had it occurred to you at any point</v>

239
00:09:39.656 --> 00:09:42.587 line:15% 
up to that time, we'll there's a job a I could get

240
00:09:42.587 --> 00:09:43.686 line:15% 
or something.
<v ->Yep.</v>

241
00:09:43.686 --> 00:09:46.346
<v ->Beautiful, it's great, you're good you know that.</v>

242
00:09:46.346 --> 00:09:47.146 line:15% 
<v Regina>Thank you</v>

243
00:09:47.146 --> 00:09:48.607 line:15% 
(laughs)

244
00:09:48.607 --> 00:09:50.247 line:15% 
What happened was when I was 15,

245
00:09:50.247 --> 00:09:53.827 line:15% 
I got out of juvenile hall, in the juvenile home for a year,

246
00:09:53.827 --> 00:09:56.087 line:15% 
and I went back home.

247
00:09:56.087 --> 00:10:00.927 line:15% 
So my mother had talked to a local contractor and firemen,

248
00:10:02.797 --> 00:10:05.127 line:15% 
by the name of Conrad Robinson.

249
00:10:05.127 --> 00:10:09.287 line:15% 
And Conrad said, "I'll take your son into my home

250
00:10:09.287 --> 00:10:11.127 line:15% 
"and for the summer I'm gonna teach him,

251
00:10:11.127 --> 00:10:13.486 line:15% 
"I'm gonna give him a skill, a trade."

252
00:10:13.486 --> 00:10:15.847 line:15% 
Learn how to hammer nails, paint,

253
00:10:15.847 --> 00:10:19.166 line:15% 
lay tile, and all that type of thing.

254
00:10:19.166 --> 00:10:24.166 line:15% 
And so, he said, "Kenny, all summer you'll live in my house,

255
00:10:24.547 --> 00:10:27.687 line:15% 
"babysit the kids, and in return at the end of summer,

256
00:10:27.687 --> 00:10:32.678 line:15% 
"I'll give you a check and you can buy your school clothing,

257
00:10:32.678 --> 00:10:35.218 line:15% 
"because you want to look good for the girls."

258
00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:36.398 line:15% 
<v Regina>Right of course.</v>

259
00:10:36.398 --> 00:10:39.018 line:15% 
<v ->And so, I said, "Great."</v>

260
00:10:39.018 --> 00:10:42.378 line:15% 
and so all summer I was painting, I was doing everything.

261
00:10:42.378 --> 00:10:45.238 line:15% 
And then it's time to get paid,

262
00:10:45.238 --> 00:10:48.118 line:15% 
he sat me down at his desk and he's started...

263
00:10:48.118 --> 00:10:51.337 line:15% 
three thousand dollar this and you know I'm hearing

264
00:10:51.337 --> 00:10:54.018 line:15% 
all these big figures, I'm like whoo, whoo.

265
00:10:54.018 --> 00:10:56.577 line:15% 
And he did some calculations and all that stuff

266
00:10:56.577 --> 00:10:59.778 line:15% 
on the calculator, then he wrote a check out.

267
00:10:59.778 --> 00:11:01.477 line:15% 
And he handed it to me.

268
00:11:01.477 --> 00:11:03.518 line:15% 
When he handed me the check,

269
00:11:03.518 --> 00:11:06.478 line:15% 
I was so ignorant at that time,

270
00:11:06.478 --> 00:11:09.238 line:15% 
I didn't know what that meant,

271
00:11:09.238 --> 00:11:12.698 line:15% 
was it $3200, $320, I didn't really know,

272
00:11:12.698 --> 00:11:14.998 line:15% 
but I said "thank you Conrad."

273
00:11:14.998 --> 00:11:19.077 line:15% 
As I was going home I said, is this $32, you know.

274
00:11:19.077 --> 00:11:20.757 line:15% 
<v Regina>No.</v>

275
00:11:20.757 --> 00:11:22.498 line:15% 
I say, "Is this $32.00?

276
00:11:22.498 --> 00:11:23.958 line:15% 
As he was talking he was saying,

277
00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:27.677 line:15% 
" Well you stayed at our place, I bought you food,"

278
00:11:27.677 --> 00:11:30.477 line:15% 
See I know but that wasn't the deal.

279
00:11:30.477 --> 00:11:32.278 line:15% 
<v Regina>Well no.</v>

280
00:11:32.278 --> 00:11:34.378 line:15% 
<v ->That was not the deal.</v>

281
00:11:34.378 --> 00:11:38.597 line:15% 
My innocent mind saying "Okay I'm gonna work for him"

282
00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:41.258 line:15% 
"I'm gonna get this amount, case closed,"

283
00:11:41.258 --> 00:11:45.977 line:15% 
Again I was not talked to, I was not explained the details,

284
00:11:45.977 --> 00:11:47.738 line:15% 
I was not given enough information

285
00:11:47.738 --> 00:11:49.678 line:15% 
to make a conscious decision.

286
00:11:49.678 --> 00:11:52.633 line:15% 
And so, once I took the check home

287
00:11:52.633 --> 00:11:54.613
and showed it to my mother,

288
00:11:54.613 --> 00:11:57.953 line:15% 
and I say, "How much is that?"

289
00:11:57.953 --> 00:11:59.513 line:15% 
And she said, "That's 32 dollars."

290
00:11:59.513 --> 00:12:02.572 line:15% 
And I said, "This isn't right mom, he said this is this,

291
00:12:02.572 --> 00:12:05.209 line:15% 
"let's go talk to him, let's go, I'm looking for her

292
00:12:05.209 --> 00:12:07.129 line:15% 
" to back me up.

293
00:12:07.129 --> 00:12:11.328 line:15% 
And she says, "Son, he knows what's best."

294
00:12:11.328 --> 00:12:14.649 line:15% 
So we're just gonna take this money, do what we can with it.

295
00:12:14.649 --> 00:12:16.508 line:15% 
<v Regina>Whoa.</v>

296
00:12:16.508 --> 00:12:18.439 line:15% 
<v ->And that was such a blow because</v>

297
00:12:18.439 --> 00:12:19.829 line:15% 
<v Regina>Wow</v>

298
00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:22.069 line:15% 
<v ->I wanted me mama to back me up,</v>

299
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:24.731 line:15% 
just to go down and say, explain this to us.

300
00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:27.730 line:15% 
And she didn't do it, out of fear or ignorance

301
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.961 line:15% 
I don't know.

302
00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:30.610 line:15% 
<v Regina>Not wanting to stir up trouble.</v>

303
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.191 line:15% 
<v ->Right don't make nobody mad.</v>

304
00:12:32.191 --> 00:12:33.271 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

305
00:12:33.271 --> 00:12:35.571 line:15% 
<v ->So, I had a friend I met in juvenile hall</v>

306
00:12:35.571 --> 00:12:38.391 line:15% 
who was sweet on my sister, his name was Pete.

307
00:12:38.391 --> 00:12:42.831 line:15% 
And I called Pete, and said never in the star high school

308
00:12:42.831 --> 00:12:45.909 line:15% 
I need some help making some money.

309
00:12:45.909 --> 00:12:47.589 line:15% 
And I knew Pete was a little hustler.

310
00:12:47.589 --> 00:12:50.129 line:15% 
So he said, I'll come over in a couple days.

311
00:12:50.129 --> 00:12:51.549 line:15% 
" and we'll do something together."

312
00:12:51.549 --> 00:12:54.669 line:15% 
Sure enough, he came over, I ditched school,

313
00:12:54.669 --> 00:12:56.610 line:15% 
moved with him up to the hardware store,

314
00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:57.890 line:15% 
we walk around the block

315
00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:59.509 line:15% 
looking for something to steal.

316
00:12:59.509 --> 00:13:01.849 line:15% 
He says, "Here we'll go to the hardware store."

317
00:13:01.849 --> 00:13:03.389 line:15% 
At nine o'clock in the morning,

318
00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:05.909 line:15% 
he says I want you to take her over in the corner somewhere

319
00:13:05.909 --> 00:13:08.709 line:15% 
talk to her for about 10 minutes, keep her distracted

320
00:13:08.709 --> 00:13:11.449 line:15% 
her back to the cash register, and I'm gonna go in there

321
00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:15.637 line:15% 
and get the money and come out, once you see me leave

322
00:13:15.637 --> 00:13:18.338 line:15% 
then come on out.

323
00:13:18.338 --> 00:13:22.287 line:15% 
And so I did that, and I saw him come in

324
00:13:22.287 --> 00:13:23.387 line:15% 
out of the corner of my eye.

325
00:13:23.387 --> 00:13:26.827 line:15% 
And I saw him come back out with his hat full of something.

326
00:13:28.537 --> 00:13:30.607 line:15% 
And I looked over at him and she turned around

327
00:13:30.607 --> 00:13:32.487 line:15% 
following my eyes, as he was going out the door.

328
00:13:32.487 --> 00:13:35.047 line:15% 
She's chasing him, and I'm chasing her trying

329
00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:36.327 line:15% 
to get out the store.

330
00:13:36.327 --> 00:13:37.987 line:15% 
And we all three running down the streets.

331
00:13:37.987 --> 00:13:40.008 line:15% 
Me and him, we run across the street,

332
00:13:40.008 --> 00:13:42.007 line:15% 
run down through these bushes and stuff,

333
00:13:42.007 --> 00:13:44.087 line:15% 
so she couldn't follow us, so we got away.

334
00:13:44.087 --> 00:13:47.727 line:15% 
I went home to my house, we divied up the money.

335
00:13:47.727 --> 00:13:50.107 line:15% 
I think it was about $150, something like that.

336
00:13:50.107 --> 00:13:52.848 line:15% 
So I said wow, it wasn't the money,

337
00:13:52.848 --> 00:13:57.807 line:15% 
It was the idea, now I know how to make cash money.

338
00:13:57.807 --> 00:13:59.008 line:15% 
<v Regina>RIght.</v>

339
00:13:59.008 --> 00:13:59.825 line:15% 
<v ->That was it.</v>

340
00:13:59.825 --> 00:14:01.585 line:15% 
<v Regina>Because working all summer babysitting</v>

341
00:14:01.585 --> 00:14:03.485 line:15% 
and building wasn't a way to make money in your mind.

342
00:14:03.485 --> 00:14:08.485 line:15% 
<v ->And you couldn't trust adults, but you could trust thieves</v>

343
00:14:08.593 --> 00:14:10.153 line:15% 
the hustlers and con men, the players.

344
00:14:10.153 --> 00:14:11.773 line:15% 
<v Regina>To come through with what they said</v>

345
00:14:11.773 --> 00:14:13.553 line:15% 
<v ->Come through with what they said they gonna do.</v>

346
00:14:13.553 --> 00:14:15.574 line:15% 
<v ->So that was is, I said I'm trusting these guys here.</v>

347
00:14:15.574 --> 00:14:18.134 line:15% 
I'm not trusting the church, I'm not trusting you know

348
00:14:18.134 --> 00:14:21.293 line:15% 
businessmen, that's out..

349
00:14:22.943 --> 00:14:24.733 line:15% 
<v ->The die is cast as they say.</v>

350
00:14:24.733 --> 00:14:25.693 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

351
00:14:25.693 --> 00:14:28.973 line:15% 
<v ->And I am not leaving these guys for no amount of money.</v>

352
00:14:28.973 --> 00:14:31.033 line:15% 
<v Regina>Cause so far that's the only thing that really,</v>

353
00:14:31.033 --> 00:14:32.544 line:15% 
<v ->That's the only thing that's worth it.</v>

354
00:14:32.544 --> 00:14:33.783 line:15% 
<v Regina>Come through for you.</v>

355
00:14:33.783 --> 00:14:34.604 line:15% 
<v ->Mhhmm.</v>

356
00:14:34.604 --> 00:14:36.693 line:15% 
<v Regina>So as you went on and got into more adult crimes,</v>

357
00:14:36.693 --> 00:14:39.813 line:15% 
you went to, how many times did you end up in prison?

358
00:14:41.853 --> 00:14:44.717 line:15% 
<v ->I have seven felony convictions, so say about</v>

359
00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:47.767 line:15% 
six or seven times I did time.

360
00:14:47.767 --> 00:14:49.897 line:15% 
<v Regina>And what kind of crimes were you committing,</v>

361
00:14:49.897 --> 00:14:51.597 line:15% 
by the time you were really reaching your peak.

362
00:14:51.597 --> 00:14:55.077 line:15% 
<v ->Oh I was strictly a money dog, I was about money.</v>

363
00:14:55.077 --> 00:14:56.177 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yea.</v>

364
00:14:56.177 --> 00:14:58.117 line:15% 
<v ->So I didn't steal jewels, I mean we stole jewlery</v>

365
00:14:58.117 --> 00:15:00.897 line:15% 
we stole other merchandise,

366
00:15:00.897 --> 00:15:03.677 line:15% 
but mainly it was cash and checks,

367
00:15:03.677 --> 00:15:07.267 line:15% 
robbing banks

368
00:15:07.267 --> 00:15:09.857
, con games, pimping,

369
00:15:10.787 --> 00:15:12.423 line:15% 
drug selling, whatever

370
00:15:12.423 --> 00:15:14.133 line:15% 
<v Regina>Anything that brought some revenue in.</v>

371
00:15:14.133 --> 00:15:15.593 line:15% 
<v ->Anything that brought some revenue in.</v>

372
00:15:15.593 --> 00:15:16.733 line:15% 
that's what I did, yeah.

373
00:15:16.733 --> 00:15:18.393 line:15% 
<v Regina>Mmhmm, so seven times in prison,</v>

374
00:15:18.393 --> 00:15:21.213 line:15% 
and what kind you went to, I assume city, county?

375
00:15:21.213 --> 00:15:23.713 line:15% 
<v ->I was city jail, county jail, state prison,</v>

376
00:15:23.713 --> 00:15:24.833 line:15% 
and federal prison.

377
00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:26.313 line:15% 
<v Regina>San Quentin or,</v>

378
00:15:26.313 --> 00:15:28.233 line:15% 
<v ->No I never did time in California.</v>

379
00:15:28.233 --> 00:15:30.173 line:15% 
I did my time in the midwest.

380
00:15:30.173 --> 00:15:31.093 line:15% 
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

381
00:15:31.093 --> 00:15:32.233 line:15% 
<v ->In the Missouri area.</v>

382
00:15:32.233 --> 00:15:33.993 line:15% 
<v Regina>So you were now,</v>

383
00:15:33.993 --> 00:15:36.433 line:15% 
were you becoming emboldened

384
00:15:36.433 --> 00:15:38.053 line:15% 
through this process

385
00:15:38.053 --> 00:15:39.373 line:15% 
<v ->Yes.</v>

386
00:15:39.373 --> 00:15:40.733 line:15% 
<v Regina>Or were you, yeah. Can you</v>

387
00:15:40.733 --> 00:15:41.613 line:15% 
talk to us about that.

388
00:15:41.613 --> 00:15:43.391 line:15% 
<v ->Okay what happens is when you go to jail,</v>

389
00:15:43.391 --> 00:15:46.491 line:15% 
and you are there for a year or two years.

390
00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:48.351 line:15% 
You gotta figure out how to do your time.

391
00:15:48.351 --> 00:15:49.971 line:15% 
So most of the guys, they're in jail,

392
00:15:49.971 --> 00:15:52.071 line:15% 
a guy that you know from the streets,

393
00:15:52.071 --> 00:15:54.311 line:15% 
so you walk around the yard or

394
00:15:54.311 --> 00:15:57.451 line:15% 
sit around a cafeteria or whatever.

395
00:15:57.451 --> 00:16:00.751 line:15% 
Planning what you're gonna do when you get out.

396
00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:03.311 line:15% 
And so we were planning our next hustle,

397
00:16:03.311 --> 00:16:04.551 line:15% 
our next crime.

398
00:16:04.551 --> 00:16:07.731 line:15% 
So it was like a school for thieves, for criminals

399
00:16:07.731 --> 00:16:09.591 line:15% 
to better their cons, their hustles,

400
00:16:09.591 --> 00:16:10.971 line:15% 
because they'res all type of people,

401
00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:13.251 line:15% 
all types of cons, so you try to figure out

402
00:16:13.251 --> 00:16:16.091 line:15% 
what feels good to you, what can keep you

403
00:16:16.091 --> 00:16:17.871 line:15% 
on the streets the longest,

404
00:16:17.871 --> 00:16:20.571 line:15% 
try to learn as much as you can about their crimes.

405
00:16:20.571 --> 00:16:21.911 line:15% 
<v Regina>So going to prison is just</v>

406
00:16:21.911 --> 00:16:23.331 line:15% 
one of the ordinary risks that you're

407
00:16:23.331 --> 00:16:24.531 line:15% 
out on the streets for a while,

408
00:16:24.531 --> 00:16:25.791 line:15% 
you go back to prison for a while.

409
00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:26.491 line:15% 
<v ->RIght.</v>

410
00:16:26.491 --> 00:16:28.041 line:15% 
<v Regina>You're back on the street again.</v>

411
00:16:28.041 --> 00:16:29.081 line:15% 
<v ->Back on the street again.</v>

412
00:16:29.081 --> 00:16:30.480 line:15% 
<v Regina>And that becomes your rhythm.</v>

413
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.809 line:15% 
How much crime is committed actually

414
00:16:31.809 --> 00:16:33.389 line:15% 
comes as a result of networking in prison,

415
00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:36.469 line:15% 
is that fairly common, I assume that's quite common.

416
00:16:36.469 --> 00:16:38.209 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, yes. I mean people</v>

417
00:16:41.319 --> 00:16:44.829 line:15% 
there are gangs that run operations from prison.

418
00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:47.529 line:15% 
They do business from prison, you know.

419
00:16:47.529 --> 00:16:49.729 line:15% 
Through the courier guys getting out,

420
00:16:49.729 --> 00:16:52.129 line:15% 
through visiting, through phone,

421
00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:54.829 line:15% 
through mail, they're able to keep the operation going.

422
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:55.989 line:15% 
<v Regina>Until they get out.</v>

423
00:16:55.989 --> 00:16:56.939 line:15% 
until they get out.

424
00:16:56.939 --> 00:16:58.509 line:15% 
<v Regina>They're still making some money.</v>

425
00:16:58.509 --> 00:16:59.749 line:15% 
<v ->Right they still make some money,</v>

426
00:16:59.749 --> 00:17:01.229 line:15% 
and money is being sent in to them.

427
00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:02.949 line:15% 
You know so they're still running the operation

428
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:04.949 line:15% 
from prison, they're getting drugs smuggled in

429
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:06.569 line:15% 
and things of that nature.

430
00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:08.769 line:15% 
<v Regina>So you're by this time,</v>

431
00:17:08.769 --> 00:17:11.929 line:15% 
I don't know, you're well well into you're adult years.

432
00:17:11.929 --> 00:17:13.679 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, yes 26,25.</v>

433
00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:15.689 line:15% 
<v Regina>And this is becoming your rhythm of life,</v>

434
00:17:15.689 --> 00:17:18.749 line:15% 
do some hustles, go to jail, do some hustles, go to prison.

435
00:17:18.749 --> 00:17:19.599 line:15% 
<v ->Right, right.</v>

436
00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:20.829 line:15% 
<v Regina>Go to federal prison.</v>

437
00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:21.669 line:15% 
<v ->Right.</v>

438
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:23.017 line:15% 
<v Regina>At any point did you say,</v>

439
00:17:23.017 --> 00:17:24.557 line:15% 
You know this is crazy, I really don't

440
00:17:24.557 --> 00:17:25.927 line:15% 
want to do this anymore?

441
00:17:25.927 --> 00:17:27.499 line:15% 
<v ->It happened</v>

442
00:17:28.819 --> 00:17:32.139 line:15% 
when I got sentenced by the federal government

443
00:17:32.139 --> 00:17:34.679 line:15% 
to 40 years in prison for writing bad checks.

444
00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:37.099 line:15% 
That was like a shock, a slap.

445
00:17:37.099 --> 00:17:38.839 line:15% 
<v Regina>Like this rhythm is going to be broken,</v>

446
00:17:38.839 --> 00:17:40.139 line:15% 
I'm not out in a couple of years.

447
00:17:40.139 --> 00:17:42.719 line:15% 
<v ->Right, and I had to do 10 years flat</v>

448
00:17:42.719 --> 00:17:44.537 line:15% 
before I could see a parole board.

449
00:17:44.537 --> 00:17:48.197 line:15% 
I'm 32 years old, and so when the judge sentences me,

450
00:17:48.197 --> 00:17:50.997 line:15% 
I had a check cashing ring, and for two years

451
00:17:50.997 --> 00:17:54.217 line:15% 
I was just chasing checks every day.

452
00:17:54.217 --> 00:17:56.638 line:15% 
I mean I had a money making machine.

453
00:17:56.638 --> 00:18:01.077 line:15% 
You know I had people who, check cashers and everything.

454
00:18:01.077 --> 00:18:03.637 line:15% 
So I was moving towards organized crime.

455
00:18:03.637 --> 00:18:04.777 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

456
00:18:04.777 --> 00:18:07.017 line:15% 
<v ->Rhythm.</v>

457
00:18:07.017 --> 00:18:10.397 line:15% 
And i got busted by the federal government,

458
00:18:10.397 --> 00:18:13.787 line:15% 
and i was sentence to 40 years,

459
00:18:13.787 --> 00:18:18.597 line:15% 
and I was transferred from the country jail to Chicago.

460
00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:22.217 line:15% 
To the Illinois Federal detention center,

461
00:18:22.217 --> 00:18:26.138 line:15% 
and that's where I had my first episode

462
00:18:26.138 --> 00:18:28.537 line:15% 
where something got the shift.

463
00:18:28.537 --> 00:18:31.577 line:15% 
And i was about ready to commit suicide.

464
00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:33.857 line:15% 
I said I'll teach them a lesson.

465
00:18:33.857 --> 00:18:36.577 line:15% 
I'll commit suicide, they'll be sad,

466
00:18:36.577 --> 00:18:37.997 line:15% 
they'll be angry, that's the way

467
00:18:37.997 --> 00:18:41.577 line:15% 
I think that's what most people who've committed suicide

468
00:18:41.577 --> 00:18:44.597 line:15% 
think they'll get back at somebody by taking themselves

469
00:18:44.597 --> 00:18:45.598 line:15% 
out of the game.

470
00:18:45.598 --> 00:18:47.277 line:15% 
That's how i was thinking.

471
00:18:47.277 --> 00:18:49.577 line:15% 
And so as I'm saving these pills,

472
00:18:49.577 --> 00:18:53.397 line:15% 
these sleeping pills, that I got for depression and anxiety.

473
00:18:53.397 --> 00:18:57.415 line:15% 
I can't sleep for from the psychiatrist or psychologist.

474
00:18:57.415 --> 00:19:00.735 line:15% 
whoever that administers medication.

475
00:19:00.735 --> 00:19:01.795 line:15% 
<v Regina>Mhhmm.</v>

476
00:19:01.795 --> 00:19:03.145 line:15% 
<v ->That's who I got them from. (laughs)</v>

477
00:19:03.145 --> 00:19:03.935 line:15% 
<v Regina>Right.</v>

478
00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:04.995 line:15% 
You got your stash of pills.

479
00:19:04.995 --> 00:19:06.475 line:15% 
<v ->I got my stash of pills.</v>

480
00:19:06.475 --> 00:19:08.495 line:15% 
And so one day, there's this black guard,

481
00:19:08.495 --> 00:19:10.635 line:15% 
he came by, he knocked on my door,

482
00:19:10.635 --> 00:19:13.375 line:15% 
he says can I come in, I say sure.

483
00:19:14.545 --> 00:19:19.395 line:15% 
he says, young man, that light inside of you won't die.

484
00:19:19.395 --> 00:19:21.813 line:15% 
You can't put it out.

485
00:19:21.813 --> 00:19:23.253 line:15% 
I said what you talking about man?

486
00:19:23.253 --> 00:19:27.813 line:15% 
I'm playing dumb, or laming, like

487
00:19:27.813 --> 00:19:29.233 line:15% 
I don't know what you're talking about.

488
00:19:29.233 --> 00:19:30.293 line:15% 
<v Regina>Mhhmm.</v>

489
00:19:30.293 --> 00:19:32.673 line:15% 
<v ->And he said, I know what you're doing,</v>

490
00:19:32.673 --> 00:19:35.049 line:15% 
he says it's not going to work,

491
00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:37.748
you got too much to live for.

492
00:19:37.748 --> 00:19:39.708 line:15% 
He said see those guys over there,

493
00:19:39.708 --> 00:19:42.069 line:15% 
a bunch of guys with dreadlocks and everything.

494
00:19:42.069 --> 00:19:45.928 line:15% 
And he says, go talk to them, these are some good guys

495
00:19:45.928 --> 00:19:47.588 line:15% 
and they can help you out of your situation

496
00:19:47.588 --> 00:19:49.168 line:15% 
in more ways than one.

497
00:19:49.168 --> 00:19:51.408 line:15% 
I say, yeah, yeah sure man.

498
00:19:51.408 --> 00:19:53.308 line:15% 
i don't know what you're talking about but sure.

499
00:19:53.308 --> 00:19:56.028 line:15% 
But I trusted it, I trusted that advice.

500
00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:59.308 line:15% 
And so the next morning, i told them who I was

501
00:19:59.308 --> 00:20:00.988 line:15% 
he already told them about me.

502
00:20:00.988 --> 00:20:02.388 line:15% 
So I went and talked to em

503
00:20:02.388 --> 00:20:04.168 line:15% 
and they said what's going on.

504
00:20:04.168 --> 00:20:05.348 line:15% 
I told them about my case.

505
00:20:05.348 --> 00:20:07.928 line:15% 
How much time I got, it's unfair, unjust.

506
00:20:07.928 --> 00:20:10.468 line:15% 
And they introduced me to an Italian guy,

507
00:20:10.468 --> 00:20:12.428 line:15% 
who's a law librarian.

508
00:20:12.428 --> 00:20:14.428 line:15% 
He says he'll look at my transcript and

509
00:20:14.428 --> 00:20:16.808 line:15% 
you know what I'm gonna help you out.

510
00:20:16.808 --> 00:20:18.768 line:15% 
And that was the first sign of hope.

511
00:20:18.768 --> 00:20:20.588 line:15% 
So I went back to my cell,

512
00:20:20.588 --> 00:20:22.708 line:15% 
got the pills out of the bed post,

513
00:20:22.708 --> 00:20:24.688 line:15% 
and gave them to the guys,

514
00:20:24.688 --> 00:20:26.518 line:15% 
and they gave them to guys who like to get high.

515
00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:27.308
(laughs)

516
00:20:27.308 --> 00:20:28.468 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

517
00:20:28.468 --> 00:20:29.508 line:15% 
<v ->You know.</v>

518
00:20:29.508 --> 00:20:30.423 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

519
00:20:30.423 --> 00:20:32.623 line:15% 
<v ->And that was like okay no I have something to live for.</v>

520
00:20:32.623 --> 00:20:33.883 line:15% 
I have a mission now.

521
00:20:33.883 --> 00:20:36.263 line:15% 
I can go through the courts and get out of this.

522
00:20:36.263 --> 00:20:39.443 line:15% 
And what happened was, for the next five years,

523
00:20:39.443 --> 00:20:42.683 line:15% 
I was fighting and fighting, trying to overturn my sentence,

524
00:20:42.683 --> 00:20:46.243 line:15% 
overturn, so when I went to the Supreme Court of America,

525
00:20:46.243 --> 00:20:50.988 line:15% 
and by the time they denied me,

526
00:20:51.218 --> 00:20:53.018 line:15% 
I had six years in,

527
00:20:53.018 --> 00:20:56.598 line:15% 
on a 10 year stinct.

528
00:20:56.598 --> 00:21:00.179 line:15% 
Well I had started reading, meditating,

529
00:21:00.179 --> 00:21:02.459 line:15% 
and reading astro projection books,

530
00:21:02.459 --> 00:21:04.099 line:15% 
and hanging out with more conscious people.

531
00:21:04.099 --> 00:21:06.159 line:15% 
Pretty soon, I said I'm here now.

532
00:21:06.159 --> 00:21:08.539 line:15% 
I had settled in for the long haul, you know.

533
00:21:08.539 --> 00:21:12.939 line:15% 
And that was the turning point in my life.

534
00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:14.658 line:15% 
When that guard came into my cell.

535
00:21:14.658 --> 00:21:16.318 line:15% 
If he hadn't come into my cell,

536
00:21:16.318 --> 00:21:17.958 line:15% 
I don't know what would've happened.

537
00:21:17.958 --> 00:21:19.819 line:15% 
I don't know, I had no idea.

538
00:21:19.819 --> 00:21:21.659 line:15% 
I don't even want to think about the options.

539
00:21:21.659 --> 00:21:24.698 line:15% 
<v Regina>So who were these fellas with the rasta</v>

540
00:21:24.698 --> 00:21:26.799 line:15% 
<v ->they were called Black Israelites.</v>

541
00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:28.419 line:15% 
<v Regina>That Black Israelites, okay</v>

542
00:21:28.419 --> 00:21:29.798 line:15% 
uh-huh

543
00:21:29.798 --> 00:21:33.538 line:15% 
And umm, gosh I forgot the name of their leader.

544
00:21:33.538 --> 00:21:37.183 line:15% 
They were very conscious men

545
00:21:38.374 --> 00:21:40.833 line:15% 
and they gave me a book to read

546
00:21:40.833 --> 00:21:44.413 line:15% 
from this author, their leader.

547
00:21:44.413 --> 00:21:47.413 line:15% 
And in the book, he was speaking about

548
00:21:47.413 --> 00:21:49.594 line:15% 
I'll never forget what he says,

549
00:21:49.594 --> 00:21:53.774 line:15% 
I looked in the sky, and the geese were stopped.

550
00:21:53.774 --> 00:21:55.473 line:15% 
They were not moving.

551
00:21:55.473 --> 00:21:58.254 line:15% 
I go wait a minute now.

552
00:21:59.974 --> 00:22:02.514 line:15% 
So I started contemplating that.

553
00:22:02.514 --> 00:22:05.334 line:15% 
And the contemplation of that.

554
00:22:05.334 --> 00:22:07.813 line:15% 
I wanted to figure out what he meant.

555
00:22:07.813 --> 00:22:10.093 line:15% 
What did he mean by that.

556
00:22:10.093 --> 00:22:13.033 line:15% 
cause I'm thinking with a literal mind.

557
00:22:13.033 --> 00:22:15.506 line:15% 
Because geese or ducks, they don't stop in the air.

558
00:22:15.506 --> 00:22:17.426 line:15% 
But his writing was so good,

559
00:22:17.426 --> 00:22:20.066 line:15% 
I got to figure out what's he's talking about.

560
00:22:20.066 --> 00:22:23.546 line:15% 
And that started me on this journey of spiritual search.

561
00:22:23.546 --> 00:22:25.406 line:15% 
<v Regina>Now you said something in your talk.</v>

562
00:22:25.406 --> 00:22:26.646 line:15% 
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

563
00:22:26.646 --> 00:22:28.846 line:15% 
<v Regina>I remember you were talking about</v>

564
00:22:28.846 --> 00:22:31.926 line:15% 
you and a friend or your brother sitting in a

565
00:22:31.926 --> 00:22:33.946 line:15% 
Sunday school service with chaplan,

566
00:22:33.946 --> 00:22:35.366 line:15% 
Right. Uh-hu Dana,

567
00:22:35.366 --> 00:22:37.166 line:15% 
<v Regina>How old were you at that time?</v>

568
00:22:37.166 --> 00:22:41.366 line:15% 
<v ->I was 44.</v>

569
00:22:41.366 --> 00:22:42.746 line:15% 
<v Regina>You were 44?</v>

570
00:22:42.746 --> 00:22:45.606 line:15% 
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

571
00:22:45.606 --> 00:22:47.666 line:15% 
<v Regina>So you're mind was starting to</v>

572
00:22:47.666 --> 00:22:49.046 line:15% 
you're mind had started opening in an

573
00:22:49.046 --> 00:22:49.987 line:15% 
entirely different way.

574
00:22:49.987 --> 00:22:51.026 line:15% 
Yeah.

575
00:22:51.026 --> 00:22:52.626 line:15% 
<v Regina>Which led to that because you had</v>

576
00:22:52.626 --> 00:22:54.006 line:15% 
a really profound understanding

577
00:22:54.006 --> 00:22:54.946 line:15% 
<v Regina>by that time,</v>

578
00:22:54.946 --> 00:22:56.486 line:15% 
yes.

579
00:22:56.486 --> 00:22:58.666 line:15% 
<v Regina>So now you're meditating,</v>

580
00:22:58.666 --> 00:23:01.006 line:15% 
you're reading philosophers, religious books,

581
00:23:02.436 --> 00:23:07.326 line:15% 
And what in that, embedded in that

582
00:23:07.326 --> 00:23:10.926 line:15% 
started really getting to you on a deep level.

583
00:23:10.926 --> 00:23:14.016 line:15% 
Well when I started reading, Muhaanda and Yogananda books

584
00:23:14.016 --> 00:23:15.606 line:15% 
they were speaking about all these cities,

585
00:23:15.606 --> 00:23:18.186 line:15% 
all these powers of gurus, and yogis'

586
00:23:18.186 --> 00:23:19.186 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yes</v>

587
00:23:19.186 --> 00:23:23.096 line:15% 
<v ->I said, wow, you can actually walk through walls,</v>

588
00:23:23.096 --> 00:23:24.466 line:15% 
<v Regina>So you like the phenomenon</v>

589
00:23:24.466 --> 00:23:26.226 line:15% 
<v ->Yea the phenomenon of waking up.</v>

590
00:23:26.226 --> 00:23:28.746 line:15% 
I said that you can read peoples mind.

591
00:23:28.746 --> 00:23:31.866 line:15% 
You can see through, you can travel to far countries

592
00:23:31.866 --> 00:23:34.206 line:15% 
without leaving your bedroom?

593
00:23:34.206 --> 00:23:37.486 line:15% 
I said oh man I want that, I'm like

594
00:23:37.486 --> 00:23:39.566 line:15% 
<v Regina>Don't we all, right.</v>

595
00:23:39.566 --> 00:23:41.566 line:15% 
<v ->I'm like I want some more sweets, right.</v>

596
00:23:41.566 --> 00:23:43.386 line:15% 
(laughs)

597
00:23:43.386 --> 00:23:45.686 line:15% 
And so its the nectar of truth, you know.

598
00:23:45.686 --> 00:23:48.606 line:15% 
And it was, man it got me on fire.

599
00:23:48.606 --> 00:23:50.166 line:15% 
To reading about, and Moopdenana said

600
00:23:50.166 --> 00:23:52.246 line:15% 
you know he stressed the Guru,

601
00:23:52.246 --> 00:23:55.446 line:15% 
waking you up shockdepot,

602
00:23:55.446 --> 00:23:57.026 line:15% 
and so I wanted to meet a guru.

603
00:23:57.026 --> 00:23:58.926 line:15% 
And so I'm having these stones desire

604
00:23:58.926 --> 00:24:03.426 line:15% 
to meet a guru and of the 1988 or 89 when I had a dream,

605
00:24:03.426 --> 00:24:07.406 line:15% 
of getting out of prison, I'm still doing 10-years,

606
00:24:07.406 --> 00:24:10.966 line:15% 
I'm getting out of prison, I'm going to these

607
00:24:10.966 --> 00:24:14.826 line:15% 
different houses and meeting different people,

608
00:24:14.826 --> 00:24:16.726 line:15% 
And we're doing all types of crimes,

609
00:24:16.726 --> 00:24:19.566 line:15% 
and I get violated, I come back to prison

610
00:24:19.566 --> 00:24:21.606 line:15% 
and I meet this white-haired person

611
00:24:21.606 --> 00:24:23.226 line:15% 
who's gonna set me free.

612
00:24:23.226 --> 00:24:25.746 line:15% 
You know give me all these cities

613
00:24:25.746 --> 00:24:26.896 line:15% 
and all these powers.

614
00:24:26.896 --> 00:24:30.046 line:15% 
I'm saying I woke up out of the dream.

615
00:24:30.046 --> 00:24:32.426 line:15% 
I wrote it down, I started following my dreams

616
00:24:32.426 --> 00:24:36.935 line:15% 
but also, but I was happy

617
00:24:36.935 --> 00:24:38.825 line:15% 
for meeting this person.

618
00:24:38.825 --> 00:24:43.161 line:15% 
But I was pissed off because now I got to get out

619
00:24:43.161 --> 00:24:46.501 line:15% 
after doing 10 years, go back to prison.

620
00:24:46.501 --> 00:24:48.161 line:15% 
I said that was a nightmare really.

621
00:24:48.161 --> 00:24:48.941 line:15% 
(laughs)

622
00:24:48.941 --> 00:24:49.921 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

623
00:24:49.921 --> 00:24:52.181 line:15% 
<v ->I woke up like ah man, wait a minute,</v>

624
00:24:52.181 --> 00:24:54.221 line:15% 
and I knew it was true.

625
00:24:54.221 --> 00:24:56.681 line:15% 
I knew it beyond a doubt.

626
00:24:56.681 --> 00:24:58.061 line:15% 
That it was true.

627
00:24:58.061 --> 00:24:59.381 line:15% 
That's why I just went into

628
00:24:59.381 --> 00:25:02.480 line:15% 
after a while I shut it off.

629
00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.621 line:15% 
So by the time I got out,

630
00:25:03.621 --> 00:25:07.961 line:15% 
I went in in 1982, and I got out in 1992.

631
00:25:07.961 --> 00:25:11.141 line:15% 
And I went back to my hometown,

632
00:25:11.141 --> 00:25:12.411 line:15% 
I started getting into crime again

633
00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:14.261 line:15% 
<v Regina>Even after you still had been studying</v>

634
00:25:14.261 --> 00:25:15.841 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah, yeah. yeah. yeah</v>

635
00:25:15.841 --> 00:25:17.661 line:15% 
<v Regina>And seeing that this wasn't the way.</v>

636
00:25:17.661 --> 00:25:19.620
Was it in part, did you feel you had permission in part

637
00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.301 line:15% 
because of that dream?

638
00:25:21.301 --> 00:25:23.581 line:15% 
<v ->No, no it was what happens is this,</v>

639
00:25:23.581 --> 00:25:26.121 line:15% 
and a good question,

640
00:25:26.121 --> 00:25:28.541 line:15% 
you can have all the affirmation,

641
00:25:28.541 --> 00:25:31.981 line:15% 
all the mantras, meditate 18 hours a day,

642
00:25:31.981 --> 00:25:35.481 line:15% 
wearing a white robe, a red robe, orange robe

643
00:25:35.481 --> 00:25:36.901 line:15% 
whatever robe it is,

644
00:25:36.901 --> 00:25:38.661 line:15% 
have the guru,

645
00:25:38.661 --> 00:25:41.281 line:15% 
but if you have not woke up,

646
00:25:41.281 --> 00:25:43.801 line:15% 
you're gonna repeat the same things.

647
00:25:43.801 --> 00:25:46.381 line:15% 
So I hadn't had the awakening.

648
00:25:46.381 --> 00:25:49.141 line:15% 
I just had a lot of concepts.

649
00:25:49.141 --> 00:25:50.061 line:15% 
<v Regina>Right.</v>

650
00:25:50.061 --> 00:25:51.361 line:15% 
<v ->Of awakening.</v>

651
00:25:51.361 --> 00:25:53.841 line:15% 
But I hadn't actually experienced the awakening

652
00:25:53.841 --> 00:25:55.820 line:15% 
<v Regina>So you did go back to prison?</v>

653
00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.321 line:15% 
<v ->I went back to prison and I violated,</v>

654
00:25:58.321 --> 00:26:00.141 line:15% 
and I got transferred to the federal prison

655
00:26:00.141 --> 00:26:02.941 line:15% 
in Littleton Colorado, and that's where

656
00:26:02.941 --> 00:26:06.821 line:15% 
I met my teacher, and that's where I had my awakening

657
00:26:06.821 --> 00:26:09.781 line:15% 
and that is what

658
00:26:09.781 --> 00:26:12.141 line:15% 
has been keeping me out ever since.

659
00:26:12.141 --> 00:26:13.559 line:15% 
<v Regina>Tell us about what happened</v>

660
00:26:13.559 --> 00:26:15.079 line:15% 
<v ->Okay.</v>

661
00:26:15.079 --> 00:26:18.459 line:15% 
We were at a small group, our teacher Gangagi came in

662
00:26:18.459 --> 00:26:20.499 line:15% 
well she wasn't my teacher at that time,

663
00:26:20.499 --> 00:26:22.079 line:15% 
she was just a teacher.

664
00:26:22.079 --> 00:26:24.079 line:15% 
And every week, what we would do,

665
00:26:24.079 --> 00:26:26.019 line:15% 
we would go to these meetings

666
00:26:26.019 --> 00:26:29.519 line:15% 
volunteers would come in such as I do now

667
00:26:29.519 --> 00:26:31.059 line:15% 
and they would show us their teachings

668
00:26:31.059 --> 00:26:33.469 line:15% 
their ideas, their philsophies,

669
00:26:33.469 --> 00:26:38.199 line:15% 
and so they said Gungis coming in

670
00:26:38.199 --> 00:26:41.076 line:15% 
have your best questions for her.

671
00:26:41.076 --> 00:26:42.776 line:15% 
And so about a week away,

672
00:26:42.776 --> 00:26:44.137 line:15% 
I'm writing down all these questions,

673
00:26:44.137 --> 00:26:45.936 line:15% 
I'm thinking about all these here,

674
00:26:45.936 --> 00:26:50.616 line:15% 
and I get to the chapel

675
00:26:50.616 --> 00:26:55.066 line:15% 
I sit down, and she's going into meditation

676
00:26:58.696 --> 00:26:59.996 line:15% 
and she comes out of meditation

677
00:26:59.996 --> 00:27:03.096 line:15% 
and she looks over to me at her left.

678
00:27:03.096 --> 00:27:07.736 line:15% 
And she says, Kenny I've been thinking about you

679
00:27:07.736 --> 00:27:09.776 line:15% 
and as soon as she said that, I just blurted out

680
00:27:09.776 --> 00:27:11.376 line:15% 
the question that I had.

681
00:27:11.376 --> 00:27:12.816 line:15% 
I said, Ghangi,Ghangi,

682
00:27:12.816 --> 00:27:15.296 line:15% 
I understand that we have to die

683
00:27:15.296 --> 00:27:20.176 line:15% 
and go somewhere before we receive God's grace.

684
00:27:20.176 --> 00:27:24.977 line:15% 
She says, Kenny, God's grace is here now.

685
00:27:24.977 --> 00:27:27.736 line:15% 
I said Ahhh.

686
00:27:27.736 --> 00:27:30.116 line:15% 
(laughs)-

687
00:27:30.116 --> 00:27:31.916 line:15% 
<v Regina>And something in those words</v>

688
00:27:31.916 --> 00:27:33.117 line:15% 
really transmitted to you,

689
00:27:33.117 --> 00:27:34.776 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah, that went around my ego, my mind,</v>

690
00:27:34.776 --> 00:27:37.896 line:15% 
it went around all these blocks I had up.

691
00:27:37.896 --> 00:27:42.716 line:15% 
And went deep inside my soul and on that spot,

692
00:27:42.716 --> 00:27:45.966 line:15% 
I was born again, I was a new person.

693
00:27:45.966 --> 00:27:48.311 line:15% 
<v Regina>To simply hear the words, God's grace is here now</v>

694
00:27:48.311 --> 00:27:51.451 line:15% 
<v ->Hear that word of truth, Right God's grace is here now.</v>

695
00:27:51.451 --> 00:27:55.051 line:15% 
Because everything in truth is here now.

696
00:27:55.051 --> 00:27:59.972 line:15% 
You remove time and space, there's only now.

697
00:27:59.972 --> 00:28:03.231 line:15% 
And so she brought me to the moment,

698
00:28:03.231 --> 00:28:07.131 line:15% 
and for the first time I could be in the moment.

699
00:28:07.131 --> 00:28:10.531 line:15% 
And being in that moment

700
00:28:10.531 --> 00:28:12.971 line:15% 
, I saw unlimited possibilities

701
00:28:12.971 --> 00:28:17.607 line:15% 
for myself and then I got, after the service was over,

702
00:28:17.607 --> 00:28:20.586 line:15% 
I walked out of the chapel, and I looked at

703
00:28:20.586 --> 00:28:23.366 line:15% 
at this woman's eyes, her name was Susan Carabello.

704
00:28:23.366 --> 00:28:25.366 line:15% 
Because she was a volunteer, I looked into her eyes

705
00:28:25.366 --> 00:28:27.766 line:15% 
and I said, aaah, now she had been coming in

706
00:28:27.766 --> 00:28:31.886 line:15% 
all these months, and she was awake but I couldn't see

707
00:28:31.886 --> 00:28:34.826 line:15% 
because I had blindness, so i couldn't you know.

708
00:28:34.826 --> 00:28:38.986 line:15% 
The blindness was my concept of who I was.

709
00:28:38.986 --> 00:28:43.246 line:15% 
But once I met Gangagi, there were no more blinders.

710
00:28:43.246 --> 00:28:46.866 line:15% 
And now I was seeing clearly, seeing other human beings.

711
00:28:46.866 --> 00:28:48.826 line:15% 
So I looked into Susan's eyes I said,

712
00:28:48.826 --> 00:28:51.546 line:15% 
Susan are you like this always, she said yes,

713
00:28:51.546 --> 00:28:53.286 line:15% 
I said aaah oh my God, oh my God

714
00:28:53.286 --> 00:28:54.507 line:15% 
(Regina laughs)

715
00:28:54.507 --> 00:28:57.307 line:15% 
Wow, and I held her hand

716
00:28:57.307 --> 00:29:01.536 line:15% 
I looked up into the sky, the night sky

717
00:29:01.536 --> 00:29:03.175 line:15% 
that's all these beautiful twinkling lights

718
00:29:03.175 --> 00:29:07.395 line:15% 
I said, wow look at those stars.

719
00:29:07.395 --> 00:29:09.654 line:15% 
That's when I fell in love with nature.

720
00:29:09.654 --> 00:29:14.034 line:15% 
All these years, i had never seen nature.

721
00:29:14.034 --> 00:29:18.075 line:15% 
You know because how can I see nature

722
00:29:18.075 --> 00:29:20.515 line:15% 
If I have not been seen.

723
00:29:20.515 --> 00:29:23.014 line:15% 
So when Gungagi saw me

724
00:29:23.014 --> 00:29:24.875 line:15% 
and she transmitted her vision,

725
00:29:24.875 --> 00:29:26.514 line:15% 
through her eyesight,

726
00:29:26.514 --> 00:29:29.234 line:15% 
then I was able to put on those glasses

727
00:29:29.234 --> 00:29:31.254 line:15% 
and start seeing what she saw.

728
00:29:31.254 --> 00:29:32.714 line:15% 
<v Regina>You weren't invisible anymore.</v>

729
00:29:32.714 --> 00:29:34.535 line:15% 
<v ->I was no longer invisible</v>

730
00:29:34.535 --> 00:29:38.955 line:15% 
I become visible, and my God.

731
00:29:38.955 --> 00:29:41.475 line:15% 
I went home through prison home,

732
00:29:41.475 --> 00:29:42.994 line:15% 
I went to my cell,

733
00:29:42.994 --> 00:29:44.575 line:15% 
<v Regina>Which was home at the time, yeah.</v>

734
00:29:44.575 --> 00:29:47.344 line:15% 
<v ->I went to my cell, I laid on the bunk</v>

735
00:29:47.344 --> 00:29:52.304 line:15% 
and closed my eyes, and all night long,

736
00:29:53.854 --> 00:29:56.714 line:15% 
I couldn't, I was between waking and sleeping.

737
00:29:56.714 --> 00:29:59.235 line:15% 
And all I heard was this humming,

738
00:29:59.235 --> 00:30:02.405 line:15% 
(humming)

739
00:30:03.694 --> 00:30:05.554 line:15% 
All night long.

740
00:30:05.554 --> 00:30:09.964 line:15% 
It was like a tape was erasing

741
00:30:11.134 --> 00:30:13.075 line:15% 
my mind, it was like

742
00:30:13.075 --> 00:30:15.734 line:15% 
you know how a tape goes (fuzzing sound)

743
00:30:15.734 --> 00:30:18.074 line:15% 
It was erasing my mind.

744
00:30:18.074 --> 00:30:21.694 line:15% 
I was watching my thoughts, but I couldn't grab them

745
00:30:21.694 --> 00:30:24.635 line:15% 
like a rushing river, I couldn't get in and grab a thought.

746
00:30:24.635 --> 00:30:28.355 line:15% 
And so I just watched these thoughts rushing by.

747
00:30:28.355 --> 00:30:31.114 line:15% 
And hearing this sound, this humming sound

748
00:30:31.114 --> 00:30:35.514 line:15% 
which is now as I understand it home of the primordial sound

749
00:30:35.514 --> 00:30:39.144 line:15% 
and I woke up the next morning, and all I wanted to do

750
00:30:39.144 --> 00:30:40.934 line:15% 
was be alone.

751
00:30:40.934 --> 00:30:45.554 line:15% 
Be quiet, be still, so I started hanging out by myself.

752
00:30:45.554 --> 00:30:48.300 line:15% 
And just being alone.

753
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:52.468 line:15% 
I would go to little dark places,

754
00:30:52.468 --> 00:30:57.368 line:15% 
in my job site, i had a job working at the micro fish

755
00:30:57.368 --> 00:31:00.768 line:15% 
researcher, and I had to shut the room

756
00:31:00.768 --> 00:31:03.908 line:15% 
and make it dark, So I would pretend I would

757
00:31:03.908 --> 00:31:06.708
be searching a park and I would sit there all day.

758
00:31:12.248 --> 00:31:13.648 line:15% 
Until it's time to go to lunch.

759
00:31:13.648 --> 00:31:16.109 line:15% 
They would knock on the door, Kenny Kenny c'mon lets go.

760
00:31:16.109 --> 00:31:19.329 line:15% 
And I would go have lunch, come back to the micropix room

761
00:31:19.329 --> 00:31:23.548 line:15% 
and just, that's how I spent the next six months or so.

762
00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:26.309 line:15% 
In Federal prison sitting in that dark room.

763
00:31:26.309 --> 00:31:28.588 line:15% 
<v Regina>Well know how bout your former colleagues?</v>

764
00:31:28.588 --> 00:31:31.209 line:15% 
<v ->Oh, all the guys I was hanging out with,</v>

765
00:31:31.209 --> 00:31:33.248 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah the ones that was really important to be</v>

766
00:31:33.248 --> 00:31:34.428 line:15% 
with and...

767
00:31:34.428 --> 00:31:36.848 line:15% 
<v ->I was hanging out with a lot of guys</v>

768
00:31:36.848 --> 00:31:38.768 line:15% 
who were talking about what we

769
00:31:38.768 --> 00:31:40.038 line:15% 
were gonna do when we get out.

770
00:31:40.038 --> 00:31:41.569 line:15% 
I was going to go into the drug game now.

771
00:31:41.569 --> 00:31:42.868 line:15% 
I was going to become a drug seller,

772
00:31:42.868 --> 00:31:44.809 line:15% 
because I was hanging out with pimps and drug dealers,

773
00:31:44.809 --> 00:31:45.929 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

774
00:31:45.929 --> 00:31:48.568 line:15% 
<v ->And so one them, my best friend, Stuntman</v>

775
00:31:48.568 --> 00:31:52.627 line:15% 
he saw that I changed,

776
00:31:52.627 --> 00:31:54.747 line:15% 
so he came over to me

777
00:31:54.747 --> 00:31:57.028 line:15% 
and we were walking the yard, he walked over and says

778
00:31:57.028 --> 00:32:00.248 line:15% 
Slim, let's go walk the yard,

779
00:32:00.248 --> 00:32:02.127 line:15% 
talk about pimps and hos and everything,

780
00:32:02.127 --> 00:32:04.088 line:15% 
and slamming Cadillac doors.

781
00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:07.468 line:15% 
I says Stunt, I ain't really feeling that man.

782
00:32:07.468 --> 00:32:10.988 line:15% 
I just want to sit here man and look at the mountain caps

783
00:32:10.988 --> 00:32:13.687 line:15% 
cause we can in Colorado, so there was snow-capped mountains

784
00:32:13.687 --> 00:32:14.677 line:15% 
all around.

785
00:32:14.677 --> 00:32:16.567 line:15% 
I just want to look at the snow-capped mountains man

786
00:32:16.567 --> 00:32:20.028 line:15% 
and watch the clouds in the sky.

787
00:32:21.838 --> 00:32:23.787 line:15% 
That's it man.

788
00:32:23.787 --> 00:32:26.007 line:15% 
He looked at me

789
00:32:26.007 --> 00:32:29.968 line:15% 
I said I'd like you to meet the woman I met man,

790
00:32:29.968 --> 00:32:34.828 line:15% 
She's brilliant, she's smart, she's just, she's great.

791
00:32:36.938 --> 00:32:39.868 line:15% 
he looked at me, I love westerns, i love cops

792
00:32:39.868 --> 00:32:41.877 line:15% 
<v Regina>And you were talking about Gogaju at this point</v>

793
00:32:41.877 --> 00:32:43.207 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah Gongaju</v>

794
00:32:43.207 --> 00:32:43.987 line:15% 
(Regina laughs)

795
00:32:43.987 --> 00:32:46.987 line:15% 
And so, I love westerns, and so stunt got up

796
00:32:46.987 --> 00:32:49.927 line:15% 
off the bench next to me, you know how in cowboy movies,

797
00:32:49.927 --> 00:32:52.027 line:15% 
how the gunslinger backs out the door

798
00:32:52.027 --> 00:32:53.288 line:15% 
says don't nobody move?

799
00:32:53.288 --> 00:32:54.247 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

800
00:32:54.247 --> 00:32:56.788 line:15% 
And so that's what he did to me,

801
00:32:56.788 --> 00:32:59.347 line:15% 
he says Kenny, whatever that is you got,

802
00:32:59.347 --> 00:33:00.547 line:15% 
I don't want none.

803
00:33:00.547 --> 00:33:04.217 line:15% 
(both laugh)

804
00:33:04.217 --> 00:33:06.748 line:15% 
<v Regina>Well but that's very telling.</v>

805
00:33:06.748 --> 00:33:08.988 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, yes, yes, he confirmed that I had shifted.</v>

806
00:33:08.988 --> 00:33:10.427 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

807
00:33:10.427 --> 00:33:12.667 line:15% 
<v ->But he also didn't want to lose his game.</v>

808
00:33:12.667 --> 00:33:14.288 line:15% 
He didn't want to lose his game because

809
00:33:14.288 --> 00:33:16.787 line:15% 
he knew if he listened to me, he'd have to give up

810
00:33:16.787 --> 00:33:18.378 line:15% 
what's he's doing and he was too invested

811
00:33:18.378 --> 00:33:20.327 line:15% 
in his mind, the in the story of who he was,

812
00:33:20.327 --> 00:33:23.827 line:15% 
to let that story go.

813
00:33:23.827 --> 00:33:25.728 line:15% 
But he recognized it on one level.

814
00:33:25.728 --> 00:33:28.307 line:15% 
But it was too dark, it was too terrifying for him.

815
00:33:28.307 --> 00:33:30.847 line:15% 
He couldn't do that. And so he and I

816
00:33:30.847 --> 00:33:33.147 line:15% 
we never really hung out anymore.

817
00:33:33.147 --> 00:33:35.967 line:15% 
<v Regina>And I heard you say earlier that</v>

818
00:33:35.967 --> 00:33:39.327 line:15% 
at that moment, when this happened for you

819
00:33:39.327 --> 00:33:41.908 line:15% 
you knew you didn't want to be part of that anymore.

820
00:33:41.908 --> 00:33:45.008 line:15% 
You were happy to look at nature.

821
00:33:45.008 --> 00:33:47.067 line:15% 
That what had happened, that's transmission,

822
00:33:47.067 --> 00:33:49.247 line:15% 
you were free,
<v ->yes</v>

823
00:33:49.247 --> 00:33:50.928 line:15% 
for the first time in your life you were free.

824
00:33:50.928 --> 00:33:51.967 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

825
00:33:51.967 --> 00:33:53.657 line:15% 
<v Regina>They could've let you out that day,</v>

826
00:33:53.657 --> 00:33:56.327 line:15% 
and you would've been no harm to society.

827
00:33:56.327 --> 00:33:58.727 line:15% 
<v ->No hard to society at all, none.</v>

828
00:33:58.727 --> 00:34:00.477 line:15% 
And I haven't been.

829
00:34:00.477 --> 00:34:04.687 line:15% 
<v Regina>So when you were finally released</v>

830
00:34:04.687 --> 00:34:06.587 line:15% 
a few years later,

831
00:34:08.687 --> 00:34:10.188 line:15% 
what did you do with your life,

832
00:34:10.188 --> 00:34:12.788 line:15% 
now that's all you've been doing since you were so young.

833
00:34:12.788 --> 00:34:14.047 line:15% 
<v ->Right.</v>

834
00:34:14.047 --> 00:34:16.328 line:15% 
<v Regina>How did you construct your life from that point?</v>

835
00:34:16.328 --> 00:34:19.728 line:15% 
<v ->It's so funny, once Ghongagi spoke those words</v>

836
00:34:19.728 --> 00:34:22.087 line:15% 
of God's grace here and now,

837
00:34:23.477 --> 00:34:25.345 line:15% 
I had one more hustle up my sleeve.

838
00:34:25.345 --> 00:34:27.045 line:15% 
That's the name of my book, the Last Hustle.

839
00:34:27.045 --> 00:34:29.105 line:15% 
<v Regina>i can't wait to read it, The Last Hustle.</v>

840
00:34:29.105 --> 00:34:31.485 line:15% 
You mean you had a literal hustle up your sleeve,

841
00:34:31.485 --> 00:34:32.576 line:15% 
<v ->One more hustle</v>

842
00:34:32.576 --> 00:34:33.976 line:15% 
<v Regina>When you met with her</v>

843
00:34:33.976 --> 00:34:34.813 line:15% 
<v ->RIght.</v>

844
00:34:34.813 --> 00:34:36.159 line:15% 
I mean I said when I get out of here,

845
00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:37.979 line:15% 
I'm gonna do this, that was my ace up my sleeve.

846
00:34:37.979 --> 00:34:39.759 line:15% 
This might not work what she's talking about

847
00:34:39.759 --> 00:34:42.159 line:15% 
but just in case I gotta hustle.

848
00:34:43.819 --> 00:34:46.999 line:15% 
When she left, she took that hustle with her.

849
00:34:46.999 --> 00:34:49.879 line:15% 
So I never forget that I said,

850
00:34:49.879 --> 00:34:52.899 line:15% 
Well how am I gonna take care of myself out there.

851
00:34:52.899 --> 00:34:56.799 line:15% 
Because all I knew to do was hustle.

852
00:34:56.799 --> 00:35:01.578 line:15% 
And but something greater said don't worry about that.

853
00:35:01.578 --> 00:35:03.319 line:15% 
You're gonna be okay.

854
00:35:03.319 --> 00:35:05.139 line:15% 
And so I was relaxed in the knowledge that okay

855
00:35:05.139 --> 00:35:06.819 line:15% 
I'm not gonna hustle.

856
00:35:06.819 --> 00:35:08.839 line:15% 
I guess I'll figure it out.

857
00:35:08.839 --> 00:35:11.199 line:15% 
I had no viable skills and I still don't have any

858
00:35:11.199 --> 00:35:14.279 line:15% 
viable skills for like making a

859
00:35:16.939 --> 00:35:18.979 line:15% 
foam padding for microphone cover,

860
00:35:18.979 --> 00:35:21.859
or hammering nails, I don't have any of those

861
00:35:21.859 --> 00:35:24.199 line:15% 
tangible type skills,

862
00:35:24.199 --> 00:35:27.099 line:15% 
so when I got out,

863
00:35:29.279 --> 00:35:32.372 line:15% 
I was getting temporary jobs for the longest.

864
00:35:32.372 --> 00:35:34.453 line:15% 
Then I landed a job at the bed factory

865
00:35:34.453 --> 00:35:36.153 line:15% 
and a plastic factory,

866
00:35:36.153 --> 00:35:38.553 line:15% 
and the supervisors they fell in love with me.

867
00:35:38.553 --> 00:35:40.813 line:15% 
Even though I couldn't meet my quota,

868
00:35:40.813 --> 00:35:44.773 line:15% 
they kept bumping me up to better paying jobs.

869
00:35:44.773 --> 00:35:48.913 line:15% 
And I said, I'm not making 150 beds a day.

870
00:35:48.913 --> 00:35:50.733 line:15% 
I'm making maybe 40-50.

871
00:35:50.733 --> 00:35:52.913 line:15% 
Yet she's pushing me up, you know.

872
00:35:52.913 --> 00:35:56.353 line:15% 
And so what happened was, I realized that

873
00:35:56.353 --> 00:35:59.393 line:15% 
this grace was taking care of me.

874
00:35:59.393 --> 00:36:01.513 line:15% 
He was taking care of me.

875
00:36:01.513 --> 00:36:04.733 line:15% 
Keeping me out here because

876
00:36:04.733 --> 00:36:08.133 line:15% 
I was talking about this grace all the time.

877
00:36:08.133 --> 00:36:10.573 line:15% 
On job sites I would talk about this grace.

878
00:36:10.573 --> 00:36:12.513 line:15% 
I would stop working and go talk

879
00:36:12.513 --> 00:36:15.573 line:15% 
to someone I saw that was depressed.

880
00:36:15.573 --> 00:36:19.333 line:15% 
I would be always available to help people.

881
00:36:19.333 --> 00:36:21.453 line:15% 
You know my daughter, my grand kids,

882
00:36:21.453 --> 00:36:26.013 line:15% 
my girlfriend, i had girlfriends that were,

883
00:36:26.013 --> 00:36:28.692 line:15% 
they say come over to the house, let's make love

884
00:36:28.692 --> 00:36:30.453 line:15% 
and I get there, and she says,

885
00:36:30.453 --> 00:36:33.193 line:15% 
how was prison for you and I start talking about

886
00:36:33.193 --> 00:36:35.233 line:15% 
Gongaji and letting go, she says,

887
00:36:35.233 --> 00:36:37.173 line:15% 
How can I let go, and I says

888
00:36:37.173 --> 00:36:40.113 line:15% 
cut that tv off, she cut the tv off

889
00:36:40.113 --> 00:36:41.333 line:15% 
I said now what,

890
00:36:41.333 --> 00:36:42.453 line:15% 
What do you see?

891
00:36:42.453 --> 00:36:43.933 line:15% 
She says, nothing.

892
00:36:43.933 --> 00:36:46.613 line:15% 
I said rest that,

893
00:36:46.613 --> 00:36:49.259 line:15% 
oh my God

894
00:36:50.849 --> 00:36:53.499 line:15% 
, oh Kenny.

895
00:36:56.009 --> 00:36:57.569 line:15% 
Well Kenny I'ma go lay down.

896
00:36:57.569 --> 00:36:59.109 line:15% 
You can go home now.

897
00:36:59.109 --> 00:37:00.409 line:15% 
I said wait a minute what about

898
00:37:00.409 --> 00:37:02.289 line:15% 
I thought we were gonna you know

899
00:37:02.289 --> 00:37:04.279 line:15% 
(both laugh)

900
00:37:04.279 --> 00:37:05.869 line:15% 
<v Regina>Well you must have at least gotten</v>

901
00:37:05.869 --> 00:37:08.429 line:15% 
some satisfaction from the experience.

902
00:37:08.429 --> 00:37:11.729 line:15% 
<v ->But I was so happy that she would lay down</v>

903
00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:13.229 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

904
00:37:13.229 --> 00:37:14.709 line:15% 
<v ->And she would come and we'd have these</v>

905
00:37:14.709 --> 00:37:16.309 line:15% 
spiritual conversations.

906
00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:18.029 line:15% 
She didn't know a think about Gongaji,

907
00:37:18.029 --> 00:37:19.949
Mopananda, nothing.

908
00:37:19.949 --> 00:37:23.169 line:15% 
But we was talking about truth.

909
00:37:23.169 --> 00:37:24.809 line:15% 
They way it showed up in her life.

910
00:37:24.809 --> 00:37:27.609 line:15% 
This grace, now of she's a Christian,

911
00:37:27.609 --> 00:37:29.289 line:15% 
but how it showed up in her life.

912
00:37:29.289 --> 00:37:31.069 line:15% 
And then I had another girlfriend

913
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:34.489 line:15% 
she called me she said, Slim i need to talk to you.

914
00:37:34.489 --> 00:37:36.189 line:15% 
Come over to the house.

915
00:37:36.189 --> 00:37:38.299 line:15% 
So I said no I don't feel like come over

916
00:37:38.299 --> 00:37:40.189 line:15% 
cause I knew what she wanted, I didn't feel like it.

917
00:37:40.189 --> 00:37:41.589 line:15% 
I was tired. And so

918
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:44.509 line:15% 
She says I need to talk to you about something.

919
00:37:44.509 --> 00:37:47.989 line:15% 
That guy Kenny of mine he's got this woman

920
00:37:47.989 --> 00:37:50.409 line:15% 
and he's driving down the highway, he's a truck driver.

921
00:37:50.409 --> 00:37:51.889 line:15% 
he's doing this, he's doing that.

922
00:37:51.889 --> 00:37:56.709 line:15% 
I said, what if Kenny never came back

923
00:37:56.709 --> 00:37:59.741 line:15% 
and drove off into the sunset and disappeared.

924
00:37:59.741 --> 00:38:01.921 line:15% 
How would that feel?

925
00:38:08.901 --> 00:38:11.521 line:15% 
Slim, you a bad mother fucker.

926
00:38:11.521 --> 00:38:13.301 line:15% 
(Regina laughs)

927
00:38:13.301 --> 00:38:17.081 line:15% 
She got it, she says, I got to lay down

928
00:38:17.081 --> 00:38:18.901 line:15% 
and hung the phone up.

929
00:38:18.901 --> 00:38:21.321 line:15% 
You know the first time you're so happy

930
00:38:21.321 --> 00:38:22.481 line:15% 
you want to relax,

931
00:38:22.481 --> 00:38:23.601 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

932
00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:26.681 line:15% 
And so, I said wow

933
00:38:26.681 --> 00:38:30.870 line:15% 
and then she was so dysfunctional

934
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:32.361 line:15% 
when I had a conversation with her,

935
00:38:32.361 --> 00:38:34.101 line:15% 
today she's a

936
00:38:34.101 --> 00:38:38.121 line:15% 
card-carrying member of a Christian church,

937
00:38:38.121 --> 00:38:40.341 line:15% 
she's doing community work,

938
00:38:40.341 --> 00:38:42.261 line:15% 
and she is the mother of her clan,

939
00:38:42.261 --> 00:38:44.133 line:15% 
of her family of brothers and sisters.

940
00:38:44.133 --> 00:38:46.913 line:15% 
Because her father died and her mother died.

941
00:38:46.913 --> 00:38:50.473 line:15% 
And she became the matriarch of the family.

942
00:38:50.473 --> 00:38:52.433 line:15% 
She is doing so good now.

943
00:38:52.433 --> 00:38:54.793 line:15% 
<v Regina>So you extended this back into the prisons,</v>

944
00:38:54.793 --> 00:38:56.413 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, yes. yes</v>

945
00:38:56.413 --> 00:38:58.073 line:15% 
<v Regina>And that's what you do to this day.</v>

946
00:38:58.073 --> 00:38:59.673 line:15% 
<v ->That's what I do right now,</v>

947
00:38:59.673 --> 00:39:02.253 line:15% 
I work at high schools, I work in prisons, anywhere

948
00:39:02.253 --> 00:39:06.173 line:15% 
my accountant says your sacred space is everywhere.

949
00:39:06.173 --> 00:39:07.913 line:15% 
You know, where you are, this is sacred space.

950
00:39:07.913 --> 00:39:09.953 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah, yeah.</v>

951
00:39:09.953 --> 00:39:11.733 line:15% 
So I have a question,

952
00:39:11.733 --> 00:39:14.473 line:15% 
Thinking back to the days in prison,

953
00:39:14.473 --> 00:39:16.233 line:15% 
all the people you met,

954
00:39:16.233 --> 00:39:19.573 line:15% 
how many, and I don't mean percentage wise,

955
00:39:21.673 --> 00:39:25.893 line:15% 
but how often would it be true that that person there

956
00:39:25.893 --> 00:39:28.453
who is there for similar reasons you were,

957
00:39:28.453 --> 00:39:31.953 line:15% 
is waiting for some kind of awakening,

958
00:39:31.953 --> 00:39:35.853 line:15% 
has this incredible potential and creativity within.

959
00:39:35.853 --> 00:39:40.073 line:15% 
And is waiting for something like what you experienced.

960
00:39:40.073 --> 00:39:42.653 line:15% 
is this a fertile field is what I'm saying.

961
00:39:42.653 --> 00:39:47.153 line:15% 
<v ->It's a very fertile field, but there's so few workers.</v>

962
00:39:47.153 --> 00:39:48.873 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah</v>

963
00:39:48.873 --> 00:39:50.933 line:15% 
<v ->So few workers.</v>

964
00:39:50.933 --> 00:39:55.903 line:15% 
you know, there's a great harvest to be had

965
00:39:57.153 --> 00:39:59.913 line:15% 
but there are so few workers to do the work

966
00:39:59.913 --> 00:40:04.513 line:15% 
In prison, and so what I found when I was in prison

967
00:40:04.513 --> 00:40:08.353 line:15% 
it was the ones who were at the low end of the totem pole

968
00:40:08.353 --> 00:40:12.353 line:15% 
who were getting beat up, raped, abused,

969
00:40:12.353 --> 00:40:16.633 line:15% 
not seen again, that were suffering the most.

970
00:40:16.633 --> 00:40:18.771 line:15% 
And those are the ones who recognize me

971
00:40:18.771 --> 00:40:21.791 line:15% 
and came to me for nourishment, for food, for shade,

972
00:40:21.791 --> 00:40:25.231 line:15% 
for comfort, and to be seen.

973
00:40:25.231 --> 00:40:27.331 line:15% 
And those are the ones I minister to.

974
00:40:27.331 --> 00:40:29.991 line:15% 
And they were the baby rapers, they were the

975
00:40:32.931 --> 00:40:35.491 line:15% 
guys who were being raped, they were the ones

976
00:40:35.491 --> 00:40:38.331 line:15% 
who were coming to me, and I would walk the yard with them

977
00:40:38.331 --> 00:40:42.911 line:15% 
talk to them, and so one day, one of them big tough guys

978
00:40:42.911 --> 00:40:45.051 line:15% 
came up to me and said man what's going on,

979
00:40:45.051 --> 00:40:46.551 line:15% 
what kind of hustle you putting down?

980
00:40:46.551 --> 00:40:47.801 line:15% 
And I said what you talking about?

981
00:40:47.801 --> 00:40:49.752 line:15% 
He says you got all these guys walking around with you,

982
00:40:49.752 --> 00:40:51.191 line:15% 
What's going on man?

983
00:40:51.191 --> 00:40:52.611 line:15% 
Don't be messing with those guys.

984
00:40:52.611 --> 00:40:54.991 line:15% 
You're one of us, a regular you know.

985
00:40:54.991 --> 00:40:57.531 line:15% 
I said, you should be doing what I'm doing.

986
00:40:57.531 --> 00:41:00.191 line:15% 
They need to hear this truth.

987
00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:03.491 line:15% 
I mean they're suffering, and look how you're treating them.

988
00:41:03.491 --> 00:41:05.171 line:15% 
You're a man of god.

989
00:41:05.171 --> 00:41:09.371 line:15% 
And so, even he was like, oh man.

990
00:41:09.371 --> 00:41:11.551 line:15% 
I'm not really being a Christian.

991
00:41:11.551 --> 00:41:13.251 line:15% 
A true Christian.

992
00:41:13.251 --> 00:41:15.611 line:15% 
And so all the guys that start hanging out with them,

993
00:41:15.611 --> 00:41:18.151 line:15% 
they start leaving 'em alone because they realized

994
00:41:18.151 --> 00:41:22.591 line:15% 
I was not trying to extort anything from them,

995
00:41:22.591 --> 00:41:26.151 line:15% 
i was just taking the hustles from them

996
00:41:26.151 --> 00:41:28.671 line:15% 
and giving them the same gift that I was given

997
00:41:28.671 --> 00:41:30.211 line:15% 
from Gongaji.

998
00:41:30.211 --> 00:41:32.791 line:15% 
<v Regina>So what would you say to everybody</v>

999
00:41:32.791 --> 00:41:35.431 line:15% 
who hasn't had this experience that you've had.

1000
00:41:35.431 --> 00:41:37.651 line:15% 
Who hasn't been incarcerated, who hasn't been

1001
00:41:37.651 --> 00:41:41.731 line:15% 
down the road to make those decisions for all the reasons

1002
00:41:41.731 --> 00:41:43.971 line:15% 
that started such as in your life.

1003
00:41:43.971 --> 00:41:46.991 line:15% 
What would you say to the rest of the world,

1004
00:41:46.991 --> 00:41:50.911 line:15% 
as we view those who are behind bars

1005
00:41:50.911 --> 00:41:54.171
and those who, and I'm going to ask a second question

1006
00:41:54.171 --> 00:41:56.151 line:15% 
after this by the way,

1007
00:41:56.151 --> 00:42:00.172 line:15% 
what do we as society need to do to change our lens?

1008
00:42:10.522 --> 00:42:13.421 line:15% 
What do we need to understand?

1009
00:42:18.031 --> 00:42:21.161 line:15% 
<v ->To love the distance franchise.</v>

1010
00:42:22.571 --> 00:42:27.571 line:15% 
To love those who you think you have no common bond with,

1011
00:42:29.771 --> 00:42:32.631 line:15% 
to drop your prejudices, your biases,

1012
00:42:32.631 --> 00:42:34.691 line:15% 
and see them as yourselves.

1013
00:42:34.691 --> 00:42:36.692 line:15% 
Really see them as human beings

1014
00:42:36.692 --> 00:42:39.531 line:15% 
who really are looking for this gift of love

1015
00:42:39.531 --> 00:42:40.831 line:15% 
that you have.

1016
00:42:40.831 --> 00:42:44.231 line:15% 
And pray for them, it was through the prayers of so many

1017
00:42:44.231 --> 00:42:48.891 line:15% 
people seen and unseen, that came to Gongaji's heart,

1018
00:42:48.891 --> 00:42:52.271 line:15% 
and caused her to create a non-profit organization

1019
00:42:52.271 --> 00:42:57.201 line:15% 
that affect prisoners, and her coming in to save me.

1020
00:42:58.791 --> 00:43:02.471 line:15% 
So pray for those, who are out there doing the crimes

1021
00:43:02.471 --> 00:43:05.991 line:15% 
pray for those who are being victimized, pray for the victim

1022
00:43:05.991 --> 00:43:09.631 line:15% 
and the victimized, they both are suffering.

1023
00:43:09.631 --> 00:43:13.711 line:15% 
That is the only way we really change this world

1024
00:43:13.711 --> 00:43:17.071 line:15% 
for the good, that is the only way.

1025
00:43:17.071 --> 00:43:19.211 line:15% 
That is the only way.

1026
00:43:19.211 --> 00:43:21.231 line:15% 
See them as yourself.

1027
00:43:22.941 --> 00:43:24.931 line:15% 
<v Regina>And then another way you also have said</v>

1028
00:43:24.931 --> 00:43:28.931 line:15% 
you came to view your time in prison as your monastary

1029
00:43:28.931 --> 00:43:31.551 line:15% 
it's highly ordered and regimented,

1030
00:43:31.551 --> 00:43:33.431 line:15% 
you don't have outside responsibilities

1031
00:43:33.431 --> 00:43:36.271 line:15% 
just what you're told to do with lots of time.

1032
00:43:36.271 --> 00:43:40.471 line:15% 
And I was thinking of that as you were

1033
00:43:40.471 --> 00:43:43.251 line:15% 
speaking, you might have been behind bars

1034
00:43:43.251 --> 00:43:44.991 line:15% 
just as people who go to monastaries

1035
00:43:44.991 --> 00:43:46.971 line:15% 
are essentially in the exact same routine

1036
00:43:46.971 --> 00:43:50.371 line:15% 
if you choose certain religious orders,

1037
00:43:50.371 --> 00:43:52.351 line:15% 
it's the same way in which you live, you get up

1038
00:43:52.351 --> 00:43:53.951 line:15% 
they tell you what to do, you do your chores,

1039
00:43:53.951 --> 00:43:55.231 line:15% 
you go to bed, you contemplate,

1040
00:43:55.231 --> 00:43:56.671 line:15% 
<v ->Right.</v>

1041
00:43:56.671 --> 00:43:58.651 line:15% 
<v Regina>But how many of the rest of us</v>

1042
00:43:58.651 --> 00:44:00.531 line:15% 
are walking supposedly free,

1043
00:44:00.531 --> 00:44:02.791 line:15% 
are actually in the same kind of prison

1044
00:44:02.791 --> 00:44:05.031 line:15% 
of our own perceptions where we can't even

1045
00:44:05.031 --> 00:44:08.531 line:15% 
grant ourselves permission to have the time

1046
00:44:08.531 --> 00:44:12.672 line:15% 
to contemplate for example.

1047
00:44:12.672 --> 00:44:15.571 line:15% 
I mean in a sense, most human beings

1048
00:44:15.571 --> 00:44:17.451 line:15% 
are in their own prison, you don't need bars

1049
00:44:17.451 --> 00:44:18.911 line:15% 
to be in prison, no, you don't.

1050
00:44:18.911 --> 00:44:21.051 line:15% 
<v ->It's the</v>

1051
00:44:24.311 --> 00:44:28.131 line:15% 
again there's so few laborers

1052
00:44:28.131 --> 00:44:31.452 line:15% 
out there than can touch people

1053
00:44:31.452 --> 00:44:34.682 line:15% 
to share this awakening with them.

1054
00:44:36.031 --> 00:44:39.331 line:15% 
Because you have to have the awakening experience

1055
00:44:39.331 --> 00:44:41.261 line:15% 
for you to be free.

1056
00:44:43.151 --> 00:44:46.312 line:15% 
What I love about the internet and tv

1057
00:44:46.312 --> 00:44:49.621 line:15% 
is that your able to meet a lot more people now.

1058
00:44:50.151 --> 00:44:52.181 line:15% 
Because of the medium.

1059
00:44:54.031 --> 00:44:55.801 line:15% 
And I would say,

1060
00:45:03.892 --> 00:45:06.659 line:15% 
Be here now.

1061
00:45:06.659 --> 00:45:09.049 line:15% 
God's grace is here now.

1062
00:45:09.049 --> 00:45:11.189 line:15% 
It always has been.

1063
00:45:11.189 --> 00:45:12.829 line:15% 
It always will be.

1064
00:45:15.389 --> 00:45:16.989 line:15% 
And if there was no time

1065
00:45:16.989 --> 00:45:19.729 line:15% 
or no space, then what's left

1066
00:45:22.839 --> 00:45:25.429 line:15% 
just this, just this

1067
00:45:25.429 --> 00:45:27.069 line:15% 
(laughs)

1068
00:45:27.069 --> 00:45:28.589 line:15% 
<v Regina>Thank you so much Kenny.</v>

1069
00:45:28.589 --> 00:45:30.369 line:15% 
I just adored our time together,

1070
00:45:30.369 --> 00:45:32.989 line:15% 
you have one of the most loving

1071
00:45:32.989 --> 00:45:34.669 line:15% 
personas and energy fields

1072
00:45:34.669 --> 00:45:36.209 line:15% 
of anyone I've ever met.

1073
00:45:36.209 --> 00:45:37.487 line:15% 
<v ->So do you. (laughs)</v>

1074
00:45:37.487 --> 00:45:38.905 line:15% 
<v Regina>Thank you dear, thank you</v>

1075
00:45:38.905 --> 00:45:40.165 line:15% 
Well I can understand,

1076
00:45:40.165 --> 00:45:43.026 line:15% 
I can see what your transmissions can do.

1077
00:45:43.026 --> 00:45:45.305 line:15% 
By your showing up and sitting with people

1078
00:45:45.305 --> 00:45:46.805
who felt like you weren't stiff.

1079
00:45:46.805 --> 00:45:48.185 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah
