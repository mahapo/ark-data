1
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.810
<v ->It seems that so often we have</v>

2
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.560
to be taken to the brink of death

3
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.910
before a great transformation begins.

4
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.865
Sheila Gilette was on her deathbed,

5
00:00:19.865 --> 00:00:22.065
lungs no longer working after giving birth.

6
00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:23.815
It was then she declared she would

7
00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:26.315
do anything to live to raise her child.

8
00:00:26.315 --> 00:00:28.515
Soon after, which is now 40 years ago,

9
00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:31.115
she was contacted by beings from another dimension

10
00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:34.415
who identified themselves as the Theo Group.

11
00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:46.246
Sheila, you are probably the most

12
00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:48.768
long-standing,

13
00:00:48.768 --> 00:00:52.093
publicly known channeler

14
00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:56.368
at this point in time, certainly in America, that I know of.

15
00:00:56.368 --> 00:00:58.013
And I'm sure there have been other women

16
00:00:58.013 --> 00:01:00.258
who might be in their 80s and 90s who have been doing this,

17
00:01:00.258 --> 00:01:02.606
but in terms of a public entity who has been sharing

18
00:01:02.606 --> 00:01:06.553
this ability with people of the planet,

19
00:01:06.553 --> 00:01:08.853
you've been at this for four decades.

20
00:01:08.853 --> 00:01:11.841
And, from a time

21
00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:14.591
when it wasn't so politically easy

22
00:01:14.591 --> 00:01:17.891
or popular to come out and say, "I'm a channeler."

23
00:01:17.891 --> 00:01:20.836
So I want people to get to know you a little bit.

24
00:01:20.836 --> 00:01:22.176
How'd this all begin?

25
00:01:22.176 --> 00:01:23.774
I know you had your epiphany,

26
00:01:23.774 --> 00:01:24.922
you had your near-death experience,

27
00:01:24.922 --> 00:01:26.872
let's talk about what your life was like before,

28
00:01:26.872 --> 00:01:29.372
during the transition, and after.

29
00:01:29.372 --> 00:01:31.672
<v ->Well, I was young, and I had--</v>

30
00:01:31.672 --> 00:01:33.562
I was a stay-at-home mom,

31
00:01:33.562 --> 00:01:35.747
I had two small children at home,

32
00:01:35.747 --> 00:01:37.797
and I went into the hospital

33
00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:41.267
to birth my third child,

34
00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:46.257
and I had a pulmonary embolism

35
00:01:46.257 --> 00:01:48.807
after the birth of the child,

36
00:01:48.807 --> 00:01:53.597
which allowed my lungs to become non-functional,

37
00:01:53.597 --> 00:01:56.577
and I was in intensive care,

38
00:01:56.577 --> 00:01:59.480
and neither one of my lungs

39
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.217
were functional, I had about a fourth of an inch of one lung

40
00:02:03.217 --> 00:02:05.217
that I could breathe with, and my family was

41
00:02:05.217 --> 00:02:07.167
being prepared for my death,

42
00:02:07.167 --> 00:02:09.467
they just didn't think I'd make it through the day.

43
00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:12.467
And I was in intensive care and I was laying in the bed

44
00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:16.802
and I knew if I closed my eyes, I wouldn't open them again,

45
00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:19.202
so I just laid there, and my mantra was,

46
00:02:19.202 --> 00:02:20.942
"Hey, God, give me a job."

47
00:02:20.942 --> 00:02:23.442
I wanted to stay on the planet for my children,

48
00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:26.895
I just had a new baby, and it was,

49
00:02:26.895 --> 00:02:29.437
"Just give me a job, I'll do anything.

50
00:02:29.437 --> 00:02:32.087
"Just give me a job, I want to stay here."

51
00:02:32.087 --> 00:02:35.232
And then I saw some movement at the end of my bed,

52
00:02:35.232 --> 00:02:38.282
and this light came in the room,

53
00:02:38.282 --> 00:02:41.532
as if the sun had risen in the room itself,

54
00:02:41.532 --> 00:02:43.427
and I was kind of blinking back tears,

55
00:02:43.427 --> 00:02:45.472
as you can imagine with a bright light like that,

56
00:02:45.472 --> 00:02:47.282
and I saw movement at the end of the bed,

57
00:02:47.282 --> 00:02:49.256
and Jesus was standing there.

58
00:02:49.256 --> 00:02:53.620
I went, whoa, you know, oh my!

59
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.980
And I kept looking at Him, and I was just mesmerized

60
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.836
by His eyes, but then my mind started going,

61
00:02:59.836 --> 00:03:02.356
"Well, your hair is shorter," and it was

62
00:03:02.356 --> 00:03:05.254
about chin-length, and it was auburn.

63
00:03:05.254 --> 00:03:08.042
In all the pictures I saw as a child,

64
00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:12.860
in churches and things were blonde, blue-eyed Jesus.

65
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.188
And His eyes were hazel, and very loving,

66
00:03:17.188 --> 00:03:21.010
and He had on a robe that had big sleeves in it,

67
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.514
and He crossed His hands under the sleeves,

68
00:03:25.514 --> 00:03:28.608
and when He did that, He looked at me and He smiled,

69
00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:32.774
and when He did that, it felt like the top of my head opened

70
00:03:32.774 --> 00:03:34.794
up and warm honey was poured in,

71
00:03:34.794 --> 00:03:36.473
because it just felt like this warmth

72
00:03:36.473 --> 00:03:38.451
started seeping through my body,

73
00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:40.475
and I couldn't take a deep breath,

74
00:03:40.475 --> 00:03:43.143
I felt like I had an elephant sitting on my chest.

75
00:03:43.143 --> 00:03:46.823
So as this warmth came down through my body,

76
00:03:46.823 --> 00:03:49.629
I felt like I could go, gasp, and take a deep breath.

77
00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.672
And when this was all happening,

78
00:03:53.672 --> 00:03:58.226
I heard in my head, not externally, as we hear each other,

79
00:03:58.226 --> 00:04:02.320
but in my head, I heard a very distinct male voice

80
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.816
say to me, "Remember, My child, you are loved."

81
00:04:05.816 --> 00:04:08.775
And it was just like, oh.

82
00:04:10.201 --> 00:04:13.217
And that was it, but it was just this moment in time

83
00:04:13.217 --> 00:04:16.575
I will never forget, it hasn't faded in my memory.

84
00:04:16.575 --> 00:04:19.925
As I speak to you of it now, it's as if it just happened,

85
00:04:19.925 --> 00:04:21.397
it's that clear.

86
00:04:21.397 --> 00:04:25.399
And it was a miraculous healing.

87
00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:28.852
And people talk about the bright light,

88
00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:31.655
well, I had the bright light, and I had Jesus there,

89
00:04:31.655 --> 00:04:34.231
but I didn't have the tunnel, but I had several experiences

90
00:04:34.231 --> 00:04:37.681
that the near-death experience studies have shown

91
00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:40.211
there are about 12 things that people experience,

92
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:43.385
not all 12 of them, when they have a near-death experience.

93
00:04:43.385 --> 00:04:47.341
Well, I didn't speak of this to others,

94
00:04:47.341 --> 00:04:49.469
because I thought, well, they'll think I'm crazy,

95
00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:51.447
and I was like, why me?

96
00:04:51.447 --> 00:04:53.428
<v Regina>Did anyone in the medical profession</v>

97
00:04:53.428 --> 00:04:55.248
wonder why such a spontaneous healing

98
00:04:55.248 --> 00:04:56.664
had occurred under the circumstances?

99
00:04:56.664 --> 00:04:59.608
<v ->Well, they were surprised, they were very surprised,</v>

100
00:04:59.608 --> 00:05:02.417
and for years, I don't know if they still do,

101
00:05:02.417 --> 00:05:05.062
but at the hospital I was in, in Denver,

102
00:05:05.062 --> 00:05:08.190
they had the lung scans that they did

103
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.468
as teaching tools, to say, did this patient live or die,

104
00:05:12.468 --> 00:05:16.604
but when I was strong enough

105
00:05:16.604 --> 00:05:18.352
to be out of the hospital,

106
00:05:18.352 --> 00:05:20.192
I was in the hospital for a month,

107
00:05:20.192 --> 00:05:23.392
and I got home about six months after that,

108
00:05:23.392 --> 00:05:26.382
I had all kinds of psychic phenomena happening to me,

109
00:05:26.382 --> 00:05:29.832
through me, internal, external,

110
00:05:29.832 --> 00:05:33.282
I could automatic write, I could do telekinesis,

111
00:05:33.282 --> 00:05:36.149
I could look at something and move it,

112
00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:40.453
I had clairaudience, I could hear messages being given to me

113
00:05:40.453 --> 00:05:43.446
and then I trance spontaneously.

114
00:05:43.446 --> 00:05:45.789
But when spirit wanted to speak to me,

115
00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.997
I would be sitting in a chair, and it would

116
00:05:47.997 --> 00:05:52.275
physically move as if someone very large was shaking it.

117
00:05:52.275 --> 00:05:56.507
And at one point, I was asked, "I'm here, can you feel me?"

118
00:05:56.507 --> 00:05:57.990
It was like, whoa.

119
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.237
<v Regina>Well, yeah, it was shaking the chair.</v>

120
00:06:00.237 --> 00:06:03.023
<v ->And I had, my bed levitated at night,</v>

121
00:06:03.023 --> 00:06:06.151
and some real unusual things.

122
00:06:06.151 --> 00:06:10.809
It was frightening, but deep down, inside of myself,

123
00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:14.786
I knew, I knew that I was being prepared

124
00:06:14.786 --> 00:06:16.991
for this job I'd asked for.

125
00:06:16.991 --> 00:06:21.272
And then when I started having the direct voice

126
00:06:21.272 --> 00:06:25.133
coming through me, it wasn't called channeling then.

127
00:06:25.133 --> 00:06:26.624
<v Regina>Transmediumship.</v>

128
00:06:26.624 --> 00:06:29.706
<v ->I was a medium, transmedium,</v>

129
00:06:29.706 --> 00:06:32.892
and then over the years, I would,

130
00:06:34.502 --> 00:06:38.254
I would not hear all the words, but now I do,

131
00:06:38.254 --> 00:06:41.612
and I think it's been the process of my own personal growth,

132
00:06:41.612 --> 00:06:43.951
of letting go of the responsibility, of feeling

133
00:06:43.951 --> 00:06:46.365
like I can control the information, which I cannot.

134
00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:47.883
<v Regina>Or like you have to be right.</v>

135
00:06:47.883 --> 00:06:50.752
<v ->Or this person has, oh, yeah,</v>

136
00:06:50.752 --> 00:06:54.625
yeah, and that the person is getting perfect information,

137
00:06:54.625 --> 00:06:56.327
well, of course we are.

138
00:06:56.327 --> 00:06:59.317
You know, and a lot of people's lives were changed

139
00:06:59.317 --> 00:07:03.154
over these years, and that was a--

140
00:07:03.154 --> 00:07:06.650
you know, I took that as a huge responsibility as well,

141
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.674
but then I had to realize

142
00:07:08.674 --> 00:07:11.519
that I'm just the vehicle

143
00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:13.753
for this fabulous information

144
00:07:13.753 --> 00:07:18.031
that's being given for the shift event of consciousness

145
00:07:18.031 --> 00:07:20.791
on our planet, and that I volunteered,

146
00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:23.505
I stepped up to the plate and said,

147
00:07:23.505 --> 00:07:27.783
and of course the angels said, "Okay, you're on."

148
00:07:27.783 --> 00:07:30.957
And my body, as I was told--

149
00:07:30.957 --> 00:07:33.388
the first spokesman was Orlos,

150
00:07:33.388 --> 00:07:35.576
and was with me for about three years,

151
00:07:35.576 --> 00:07:38.612
and I was told all along that I was

152
00:07:38.612 --> 00:07:41.464
being prepared for higher teachers to come.

153
00:07:41.464 --> 00:07:43.297
<v Regina>So you're saying that the being you</v>

154
00:07:43.297 --> 00:07:45.045
were speaking to was named?

155
00:07:45.045 --> 00:07:49.472
<v ->Orlos, but as an initiator.</v>

156
00:07:49.472 --> 00:07:54.052
Orlos was very soft-spoken, very loving.

157
00:07:54.052 --> 00:07:56.260
Had Theo come through in the beginning,

158
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.277
because when they came through, when Orlos,

159
00:07:58.277 --> 00:08:01.200
I went into trance

160
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.865
to invite Orlos in to speak,

161
00:08:03.865 --> 00:08:08.327
and for a reading that someone had mailed some questions,

162
00:08:09.617 --> 00:08:14.207
and Orlos said, "It's time, and higher teachers are here."

163
00:08:15.567 --> 00:08:19.353
And I was told that my body was being shifted

164
00:08:19.353 --> 00:08:22.711
in the electromagnetic field, on a cellular level,

165
00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:26.713
to be able to merge with this energy that was so strong,

166
00:08:26.713 --> 00:08:30.485
and when Theo came in, oh, my gosh.

167
00:08:30.485 --> 00:08:31.949
<v Regina>Theo is quite a force.</v>

168
00:08:31.949 --> 00:08:36.733
<v ->Yes, but Theo softened, softened.</v>

169
00:08:36.733 --> 00:08:39.447
<v Regina>The being, the collective had softened?</v>

170
00:08:39.447 --> 00:08:41.701
<v ->When Theo came in the first time,</v>

171
00:08:41.701 --> 00:08:44.645
it was as if the windows would have shaken,

172
00:08:44.645 --> 00:08:48.463
the voice was so loud, and I felt this tingling

173
00:08:48.463 --> 00:08:51.821
in my upper body, through my neck and my head.

174
00:08:51.821 --> 00:08:53.799
You know when you hit your elbow

175
00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:56.605
and you have that tingling that's really uncomfortable?

176
00:08:56.605 --> 00:09:00.101
That's what I felt in my whole upper body when they came in,

177
00:09:00.101 --> 00:09:01.585
and it was like, oh, my gosh.

178
00:09:01.585 --> 00:09:02.873
<v Regina>And this is a no-nonsense--</v>

179
00:09:02.873 --> 00:09:07.639
<v ->This is no-nonsense, and they sounded very computer-like,</v>

180
00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:12.377
with no emotion, very staccato, almost,

181
00:09:12.377 --> 00:09:15.132
and it was like, oh, my gosh, had they come in

182
00:09:15.132 --> 00:09:18.988
in the beginning, I would have been too afraid.

183
00:09:18.988 --> 00:09:22.191
But when they did, I didn't hear it

184
00:09:22.191 --> 00:09:25.868
like others heard it either, so, you know,

185
00:09:25.868 --> 00:09:29.272
but it was, it shook up a few people.

186
00:09:29.272 --> 00:09:31.526
<v Regina>Yeah, quite shocking to your girlfriends.</v>

187
00:09:31.526 --> 00:09:34.232
Let's hang around and meet the friends for the first time.

188
00:09:34.232 --> 00:09:37.038
<v ->And I had an office one time,</v>

189
00:09:37.038 --> 00:09:40.074
across the hall from a psychotherapist,

190
00:09:40.074 --> 00:09:44.260
and she came and knocked on my door one time,

191
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.710
and she said, "Could you ask Theo to be a little quieter,

192
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.424
"because we can hear you through the walls."

193
00:09:50.424 --> 00:09:52.763
(chuckling)

194
00:09:52.763 --> 00:09:54.767
So it was quite loud, Theo softened,

195
00:09:54.767 --> 00:09:57.193
and has actually become

196
00:09:57.193 --> 00:10:00.459
more human-like in that sense,

197
00:10:00.459 --> 00:10:01.950
because they've not been embodied,

198
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.308
they're learning through us the human experience.

199
00:10:05.308 --> 00:10:07.450
So it's been quite the ride.

200
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:08.968
<v Regina>And it's interesting,</v>

201
00:10:08.968 --> 00:10:12.556
because they have to find the very specific words,

202
00:10:12.556 --> 00:10:14.856
and it's more dictionary-like, we were talking about this

203
00:10:14.856 --> 00:10:18.180
off-camera, where we might have

204
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.564
come to understand a word in a colloquial sense,

205
00:10:21.564 --> 00:10:24.649
and that's not necessarily what they mean

206
00:10:24.649 --> 00:10:27.084
when they're speaking, they're being quite literal,

207
00:10:27.084 --> 00:10:29.295
you almost need to refer to the dictionary

208
00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:31.144
if you want to have the exact interpretation

209
00:10:31.144 --> 00:10:32.938
of what's being said, because that's--

210
00:10:32.938 --> 00:10:36.230
it sounds like that's the portal through which

211
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.278
they can communicate, be very clear with their language.

212
00:10:39.278 --> 00:10:41.834
<v ->They're very clear with what they have to say to us,</v>

213
00:10:41.834 --> 00:10:45.783
and they don't use a lot of extraneous words.

214
00:10:45.783 --> 00:10:48.247
They're very direct with what they have to say,

215
00:10:48.247 --> 00:10:52.426
and I learned, you know, a sentence would be stated,

216
00:10:52.426 --> 00:10:55.140
and I'd go, "Well, I think I know what that means,

217
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.701
"but that way, it doesn't make too much sense to me,"

218
00:10:58.701 --> 00:11:00.909
and that's when I started getting the dictionary,

219
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:06.540
and it just was so enlightening,

220
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.932
it was like, oh, my gosh, I didn't know

221
00:11:08.932 --> 00:11:13.386
what that word really was until it was used in this context.

222
00:11:13.386 --> 00:11:17.342
So it was interesting,

223
00:11:17.342 --> 00:11:19.220
even in the new book,

224
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.256
The Soul Truth: Guide to Inner Peace,

225
00:11:22.256 --> 00:11:25.073
when the editors at Tarcher

226
00:11:25.073 --> 00:11:27.419
were going through the book,

227
00:11:27.419 --> 00:11:29.454
Theo used a word,

228
00:11:29.454 --> 00:11:33.180
cognation, instead of cognition,

229
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.446
and the editors there called and said, "Is that a real word?

230
00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:38.056
"Did they make that up?"

231
00:11:38.056 --> 00:11:42.058
And it was, it's a cognitive kind of experience,

232
00:11:42.058 --> 00:11:44.588
and I can't remember the exact sentence right now,

233
00:11:44.588 --> 00:11:46.285
but I thought it was so funny,

234
00:11:46.285 --> 00:11:47.527
they came back and they said,

235
00:11:47.527 --> 00:11:49.175
"You've got to change this word, it's not a real--"

236
00:11:49.175 --> 00:11:51.429
and we said, "Oh, yeah, it's a real word."

237
00:11:51.429 --> 00:11:55.799
You know, so they're, like, they take this information--

238
00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:59.490
my vocabulary has grown tremendously

239
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.468
with working with Theo,

240
00:12:01.468 --> 00:12:04.185
because they use words I never would use

241
00:12:04.185 --> 00:12:06.738
in my every day life, that I use now

242
00:12:06.738 --> 00:12:08.900
because they've taught them to me.

243
00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.798
<v Regina>Well, I mean, we could launch</v>

244
00:12:11.798 --> 00:12:15.248
into so many areas, I think I'm going to skip past--

245
00:12:15.248 --> 00:12:18.284
we would have to go back a bit, and go to,

246
00:12:18.284 --> 00:12:19.887
let's get into the definitions,

247
00:12:19.887 --> 00:12:22.167
a lot of people today call themselves channelers.

248
00:12:22.167 --> 00:12:25.150
A lot of people, I mean, thousands and thousands of people,

249
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.404
"Oh, yes, I started channeling the other day."

250
00:12:27.404 --> 00:12:30.900
What is the difference between channeling, mediumship,

251
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.599
and doing a reading, say, an intuitive reading for someone?

252
00:12:34.599 --> 00:12:36.523
How would you define?

253
00:12:36.523 --> 00:12:39.079
<v ->Well, in my personal experience,</v>

254
00:12:40.419 --> 00:12:43.468
I'm a medium, I've never cared much

255
00:12:43.468 --> 00:12:46.231
for the terminology of channeling.

256
00:12:46.231 --> 00:12:49.172
You know, I don't understand it, what does that mean?

257
00:12:49.172 --> 00:12:52.392
And so what I've come to think of as--

258
00:12:52.392 --> 00:12:56.440
a channeling is maybe, and it may be just for you,

259
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.633
information that is given to you,

260
00:12:59.633 --> 00:13:03.405
maybe through writing or it could be music,

261
00:13:03.405 --> 00:13:07.545
that you're just downloading into your own experience.

262
00:13:07.545 --> 00:13:10.501
What I do is that

263
00:13:10.501 --> 00:13:13.241
the angels actually take my body

264
00:13:13.241 --> 00:13:17.059
and speak directly through me, through my vocal cords.

265
00:13:17.059 --> 00:13:19.359
They're limited to my language,

266
00:13:19.359 --> 00:13:21.475
I'm hoping to learn other languages,

267
00:13:21.475 --> 00:13:24.284
because I know they can speak those as well,

268
00:13:24.284 --> 00:13:27.363
but they've said, they use what I have,

269
00:13:27.363 --> 00:13:30.234
they use my resources, yes,

270
00:13:30.234 --> 00:13:32.847
but it's very engaging,

271
00:13:32.847 --> 00:13:36.941
where they take full control,

272
00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:40.705
I don't have any influence over the information.

273
00:13:40.705 --> 00:13:45.009
And I think there are, in some circumstances,

274
00:13:45.009 --> 00:13:48.152
people who channeled, it can get distorted,

275
00:13:48.152 --> 00:13:52.459
because it comes through their own mental processes,

276
00:13:52.459 --> 00:13:54.354
and their own personal experience.

277
00:13:54.354 --> 00:13:55.550
<v Regina>Their own filters.</v>

278
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.022
<v ->Yeah, their own filters.</v>

279
00:13:57.022 --> 00:13:59.874
And then, intuitive readings, as card readers,

280
00:13:59.874 --> 00:14:03.987
or astrologers, I think there are very good people

281
00:14:03.987 --> 00:14:06.103
that do that, but they're impressions,

282
00:14:06.103 --> 00:14:08.541
they're intuitive impressions that they receive

283
00:14:08.541 --> 00:14:10.867
through their own filters as well,

284
00:14:10.867 --> 00:14:13.075
and I think, for me, the definition

285
00:14:13.075 --> 00:14:16.893
between the mediumship and intuition

286
00:14:16.893 --> 00:14:20.079
is that, as I said,

287
00:14:20.079 --> 00:14:22.865
my filter isn't involved.

288
00:14:22.865 --> 00:14:26.177
The information comes directly through them,

289
00:14:26.177 --> 00:14:29.910
and in fact, I had, you know, years ago,

290
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.995
before I really started releasing

291
00:14:32.995 --> 00:14:36.093
and just letting go totally.

292
00:14:36.093 --> 00:14:38.465
There was one lady that was having

293
00:14:38.465 --> 00:14:41.041
a session with Theo, and I kept thinking,

294
00:14:41.041 --> 00:14:43.433
"Well, that's not right, that's not right."

295
00:14:43.433 --> 00:14:45.082
<v Regina>I was just going to ask you that.</v>

296
00:14:45.082 --> 00:14:48.773
<v ->And, you know, my good ideas</v>

297
00:14:48.773 --> 00:14:52.107
were totally off-base,

298
00:14:52.107 --> 00:14:55.232
and what they gave her was perfect for her life.

299
00:14:55.232 --> 00:14:57.302
<v Regina>So you're hearing it as it's coming</v>

300
00:14:57.302 --> 00:14:59.053
out of your mouth, you don't have a chance

301
00:14:59.053 --> 00:15:00.501
to audit or edit or anything, of course--

302
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:01.973
<v ->And it comes so quickly.</v>

303
00:15:01.973 --> 00:15:03.215
<v Regina>You're thinking, "My God,</v>

304
00:15:03.215 --> 00:15:05.745
"that doesn't sound right," so you have your own judgement--

305
00:15:05.745 --> 00:15:07.864
<v ->Well, and years ago, you know,</v>

306
00:15:07.864 --> 00:15:10.345
I'm a witnesser, just as everybody else,

307
00:15:10.345 --> 00:15:12.047
so I just stand aside and listen,

308
00:15:12.047 --> 00:15:14.109
and, you know,

309
00:15:14.109 --> 00:15:17.210
I'll hear them telling somebody something,

310
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.292
and then I know, you know, years ago,

311
00:15:20.292 --> 00:15:22.592
it's going to blow their life wide open,

312
00:15:22.592 --> 00:15:25.904
and I'm going, "Oh, no, here it comes."

313
00:15:25.904 --> 00:15:28.920
You know, but it's perfect for them.

314
00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.232
You know, nobody's ever given anything they can't handle,

315
00:15:32.232 --> 00:15:35.222
because it's all question-activated,

316
00:15:35.222 --> 00:15:38.875
because in the asking, it will be given.

317
00:15:38.875 --> 00:15:42.325
They do not usurp people's free will,

318
00:15:42.325 --> 00:15:45.492
and if you're ready to ask the question,

319
00:15:45.492 --> 00:15:48.646
you're ready to hear the answer, you may not like it.

320
00:15:48.646 --> 00:15:51.682
You know, some people would ask a question,

321
00:15:51.682 --> 00:15:54.388
and they wouldn't hear exactly what they wanted to hear,

322
00:15:54.388 --> 00:15:57.608
so they would rephrase it and ask it again,

323
00:15:57.608 --> 00:15:59.947
and, periodically, Theo would say,

324
00:15:59.947 --> 00:16:01.649
"We've already answered that."

325
00:16:01.649 --> 00:16:04.593
<v Regina>Right, now, is there--</v>

326
00:16:04.593 --> 00:16:07.112
do you have a sense that

327
00:16:07.112 --> 00:16:09.350
there are times when someone,

328
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.006
the person asking the question,

329
00:16:11.006 --> 00:16:13.038
that they're present enough, they've shown up,

330
00:16:13.038 --> 00:16:14.372
they're asking the questions,

331
00:16:14.372 --> 00:16:16.396
so something is driving them to do that,

332
00:16:16.396 --> 00:16:18.120
but maybe their knowledge base

333
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.344
isn't such that they could understand

334
00:16:20.344 --> 00:16:22.159
the answer in its full form,

335
00:16:22.159 --> 00:16:24.800
do you find that sometimes that Theo

336
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.158
will simplify, for example,

337
00:16:28.158 --> 00:16:30.182
for a particular individual asking

338
00:16:30.182 --> 00:16:32.804
or is it pretty much meted out the same regardless?

339
00:16:35.321 --> 00:16:39.826
<v ->Maybe they do, but what I've found with Theo</v>

340
00:16:39.826 --> 00:16:44.317
is that their information is multi-level,

341
00:16:44.317 --> 00:16:48.132
multi-dimensional, as well, because you can listen

342
00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:50.333
to the session

343
00:16:50.333 --> 00:16:52.790
and you glean what you glean from it

344
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:56.024
in that moment, with your perceptions

345
00:16:56.024 --> 00:17:00.532
in that moment, then you can listen to it six months later,

346
00:17:00.532 --> 00:17:03.338
a year later, five years later,

347
00:17:03.338 --> 00:17:06.144
and you get so much more out of it,

348
00:17:06.144 --> 00:17:09.640
because you've lived into the understanding.

349
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.299
But you get what you get at whatever

350
00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:15.366
level you are at the moment.

351
00:17:15.366 --> 00:17:17.896
I had a lady, one time in a session,

352
00:17:17.896 --> 00:17:22.101
that Theo said to her, at the end of the session, they said,

353
00:17:22.101 --> 00:17:24.125
"You're going to put this away for two years,

354
00:17:24.125 --> 00:17:25.919
"and you will not listen to it."

355
00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:29.886
I got a call from her, it was almost two years to the day,

356
00:17:29.886 --> 00:17:31.818
and she said, "I think I need another reading.

357
00:17:31.818 --> 00:17:33.454
"I found this reading in the drawer,

358
00:17:33.454 --> 00:17:36.050
"and they were absolutely right."

359
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.626
But she didn't hear it at the time when they said that.

360
00:17:38.626 --> 00:17:42.539
And she found it in the drawer, listened to it,

361
00:17:42.539 --> 00:17:45.039
and heard, "You're going to put this away,

362
00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:47.385
"you won't pay any attention to it for two years,"

363
00:17:47.385 --> 00:17:49.665
and it was almost two years to the day that she found it,

364
00:17:49.665 --> 00:17:52.303
and called and said, "I think I need to talk to them."

365
00:17:52.303 --> 00:17:54.047
<v Regina>Until she was really ready to hear it.</v>

366
00:17:54.047 --> 00:17:57.581
<v ->Yeah, she wasn't really ready, and...</v>

367
00:17:59.335 --> 00:18:03.080
<v Regina>How many people are looking for real knowledge?</v>

368
00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.472
You know what I'm saying, versus,

369
00:18:05.472 --> 00:18:09.198
that, quote, validation, wanting to hear that they're

370
00:18:09.198 --> 00:18:11.585
already correct, and all their perceptions are right,

371
00:18:11.585 --> 00:18:12.984
and they're already on the right track.

372
00:18:12.984 --> 00:18:14.916
You know, some people go to readings

373
00:18:14.916 --> 00:18:18.063
just to hear how great everything is already lined up,

374
00:18:18.063 --> 00:18:21.007
versus people who really, really want to know.

375
00:18:21.007 --> 00:18:23.859
<v ->Well, that's--</v>

376
00:18:23.859 --> 00:18:25.563
they're both good,

377
00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:29.784
because people are opening up very quickly right now.

378
00:18:29.784 --> 00:18:34.476
And so, what I have found that people will come to Theo

379
00:18:34.476 --> 00:18:37.670
and they get affirmed,

380
00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:39.950
and confirmed in their own knowing,

381
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:42.618
which we need, to know we're on the right track,

382
00:18:42.618 --> 00:18:47.349
but as we go through those questions of our everyday life,

383
00:18:47.349 --> 00:18:50.825
and we get those satisfied, then people go

384
00:18:50.825 --> 00:18:53.493
into the broader questions, the bigger things,

385
00:18:53.493 --> 00:18:56.529
and now, with Theo's teaching of soul integration,

386
00:18:56.529 --> 00:18:58.875
people are really doing their work,

387
00:18:58.875 --> 00:19:02.325
and if they're not willing to, they don't come to Theo.

388
00:19:02.325 --> 00:19:03.981
But it's taken a lot of years,

389
00:19:03.981 --> 00:19:06.438
Theo's been way ahead of the curve,

390
00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:10.087
and when The Fifth Dimension came out--

391
00:19:10.087 --> 00:19:11.631
<v Regina>It was mid-80s?</v>

392
00:19:11.631 --> 00:19:14.437
<v ->It was '88, December of '88.</v>

393
00:19:14.437 --> 00:19:19.330
I thought it was metaphysics, parapsychology 101,

394
00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:23.128
spirituality 101, that everybody knew this stuff.

395
00:19:23.128 --> 00:19:24.656
And people would say, "I had to read it

396
00:19:24.656 --> 00:19:25.852
"five times to understand."

397
00:19:25.852 --> 00:19:27.414
<v Regina>Well, you've been at it for,</v>

398
00:19:27.414 --> 00:19:29.089
what, 19 years at that point?

399
00:19:29.089 --> 00:19:31.573
So, yes, it would be 101 for you,

400
00:19:31.573 --> 00:19:34.669
but that was still quite revolutionary 20 years ago.

401
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:36.126
<v ->It was, and it still is today.</v>

402
00:19:36.126 --> 00:19:39.131
It's very, it's pertinent information for right now,

403
00:19:39.131 --> 00:19:42.975
and then with the book, The Soul Truth,

404
00:19:42.975 --> 00:19:46.612
it's really giving people tools to get in touch

405
00:19:46.612 --> 00:19:49.691
and to really integrate themselves,

406
00:19:49.691 --> 00:19:52.129
so that they're open and receptive

407
00:19:52.129 --> 00:19:55.395
to their own masterhood or to their own guidance,

408
00:19:55.395 --> 00:19:58.615
and trusting themselves, and not getting caught up

409
00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:02.249
into the day-to-day circumstances, because that's what we do

410
00:20:02.249 --> 00:20:05.975
and then we react from the fragmented aspects of ourselves

411
00:20:05.975 --> 00:20:09.980
rather than our wholeness, and when we come

412
00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.093
into that fullness of ourselves,

413
00:20:12.093 --> 00:20:16.371
no matter what's happening in the outer world, to us,

414
00:20:16.371 --> 00:20:20.051
or situations and circumstances are always going to occur,

415
00:20:20.051 --> 00:20:21.983
I mean, that's part of life,

416
00:20:21.983 --> 00:20:24.973
but it's how we deal with them that changes.

417
00:20:24.973 --> 00:20:28.738
And people say, "I want to be happy, I want to be happy."

418
00:20:28.738 --> 00:20:30.377
Well, what does that mean?

419
00:20:30.377 --> 00:20:33.771
The word happy is from happenstance,

420
00:20:33.771 --> 00:20:37.431
something happens and then you can be happy.

421
00:20:37.431 --> 00:20:40.237
Well, really what people are looking for is

422
00:20:40.237 --> 00:20:44.196
being peaceful inside, being comfortable in their own skin,

423
00:20:44.196 --> 00:20:46.861
and when you integrate and bring in all those

424
00:20:46.861 --> 00:20:48.931
little fragmented aspects of ourself that

425
00:20:48.931 --> 00:20:51.231
really run the show, I mean, they're the real

426
00:20:51.231 --> 00:20:54.773
emotional ones that run our lives,

427
00:20:54.773 --> 00:20:57.533
when we comfort them and let them know

428
00:20:57.533 --> 00:21:01.167
that we're not abandoning them and they have a voice,

429
00:21:01.167 --> 00:21:03.421
and we understand, we're conscious of them,

430
00:21:03.421 --> 00:21:05.445
then we find that peace,

431
00:21:05.445 --> 00:21:09.585
and we can respond differently to those situations.

432
00:21:09.585 --> 00:21:12.660
<v Regina>So people are driven by every kind</v>

433
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.265
of question imaginable to find their way to you,

434
00:21:15.265 --> 00:21:17.795
and through the years, a number of people

435
00:21:17.795 --> 00:21:20.046
have found their way, because they, too,

436
00:21:20.046 --> 00:21:21.932
were feeling as though there might be something

437
00:21:21.932 --> 00:21:25.155
knocking on their door, trying to get their attention,

438
00:21:25.155 --> 00:21:28.687
and also, to Esther Hicks, now, Esther has become

439
00:21:28.687 --> 00:21:30.323
quite well known in this field,

440
00:21:30.323 --> 00:21:32.109
and you were her mentor, you're--

441
00:21:32.109 --> 00:21:34.773
channeling with you, she was coming to your sessions,

442
00:21:34.773 --> 00:21:36.455
as I understand it, right?

443
00:21:36.455 --> 00:21:38.150
<v ->Yes, she and her husband, Jerry,</v>

444
00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.403
came from private sessions.

445
00:21:40.403 --> 00:21:42.887
<v Regina>And they were told by Theo,</v>

446
00:21:42.887 --> 00:21:44.773
"You two can do this."

447
00:21:44.773 --> 00:21:48.407
And this hasn't been an uncommon message, per se,

448
00:21:48.407 --> 00:21:50.523
but she really embraced it, she just went

449
00:21:50.523 --> 00:21:52.540
with full vigor and took it on, and then--

450
00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.237
<v ->She did, she stepped out of her fear,</v>

451
00:21:55.237 --> 00:21:59.469
because it scared her, as it does most people.

452
00:21:59.469 --> 00:22:02.283
But she was compelled.

453
00:22:02.283 --> 00:22:06.327
And I have to tell you, I'm just thrilled

454
00:22:06.327 --> 00:22:08.420
with all the success that they've had,

455
00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:11.134
and the amount of people they've touched,

456
00:22:11.134 --> 00:22:14.669
because people need to have

457
00:22:14.669 --> 00:22:17.710
a place to feel safe,

458
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.905
and Abraham's information has drawn people in,

459
00:22:20.905 --> 00:22:23.576
in many ways that never would have,

460
00:22:23.576 --> 00:22:26.425
never would have touched the subject.

461
00:22:26.425 --> 00:22:29.047
It's been a good launching pad for them,

462
00:22:29.047 --> 00:22:31.228
to really open spiritually,

463
00:22:31.228 --> 00:22:35.322
so it just makes my heart happy to see

464
00:22:35.322 --> 00:22:37.300
that this has been happening,

465
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.440
and that Theo has been a part of that experience.

466
00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.595
<v Regina>Yes, helping give her the understanding</v>

467
00:22:43.595 --> 00:22:45.576
and confidence to know that she could do this.

468
00:22:45.576 --> 00:22:48.980
And Jerry, as well, working with her as her partner.

469
00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.536
And there are other people who have come to you,

470
00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:53.872
and a similar thing, I assume, has happened,

471
00:22:53.872 --> 00:22:56.080
where they've opened up their own

472
00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.346
mediumship abilities or intuitive abilities?

473
00:22:59.346 --> 00:23:03.159
<v ->Intuitive and healing, you know, because it'll express</v>

474
00:23:03.159 --> 00:23:05.804
in whatever way is comfortable for you,

475
00:23:05.804 --> 00:23:08.656
it has to be emotionally and psychologically comfortable,

476
00:23:08.656 --> 00:23:10.726
or you won't do it, and some people

477
00:23:10.726 --> 00:23:13.554
use their intuitive abilities to heal,

478
00:23:13.554 --> 00:23:16.731
and to move energy, and actually,

479
00:23:16.731 --> 00:23:19.120
they're just a conduit to the energy

480
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.776
and focusing the person feels themselves,

481
00:23:22.776 --> 00:23:25.352
but they're, you know, it's a collaboration

482
00:23:25.352 --> 00:23:27.652
between the person seeking the balancing

483
00:23:27.652 --> 00:23:30.507
and the person that does the balancing,

484
00:23:30.507 --> 00:23:33.812
so it expresses that way, artists,

485
00:23:33.812 --> 00:23:36.395
it expresses in painting and sculpture

486
00:23:36.395 --> 00:23:39.087
and music and writing,

487
00:23:39.087 --> 00:23:43.459
so each in their own way have that conduit

488
00:23:43.459 --> 00:23:45.897
to their higher self, their soul,

489
00:23:45.897 --> 00:23:48.103
and the guidance that is present.

490
00:23:48.103 --> 00:23:50.175
<v Regina>And it must be really beautiful when you see</v>

491
00:23:50.175 --> 00:23:53.763
someone who has come in, who is severely disconnected

492
00:23:53.763 --> 00:23:56.551
from their true self, and not happy,

493
00:23:56.551 --> 00:23:58.853
not happy with the life they've created,

494
00:23:58.853 --> 00:24:02.625
and it must be very satisfying when, for you,

495
00:24:02.625 --> 00:24:06.719
when they find out, "Well, my dear,

496
00:24:06.719 --> 00:24:09.347
"it's because this isn't who, this isn't what you came

497
00:24:09.347 --> 00:24:11.969
"to do, this isn't your particular skillset

498
00:24:11.969 --> 00:24:14.315
"that you came to develop that you're working in."

499
00:24:14.315 --> 00:24:17.995
And to have them make that discovery alongside you.

500
00:24:17.995 --> 00:24:20.525
You must hear a lot of these stories where

501
00:24:20.525 --> 00:24:23.731
they blossom into an entirely new life

502
00:24:23.731 --> 00:24:26.029
after being exposed to the information.

503
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:28.559
<v ->Yes, they do, they do,</v>

504
00:24:28.559 --> 00:24:31.299
and Theo doesn't tell us what to do,

505
00:24:31.299 --> 00:24:36.221
which is a lovely thing, they lead us in a direction

506
00:24:36.221 --> 00:24:38.271
that's for our highest good.

507
00:24:38.271 --> 00:24:41.471
And I know, I've been challenged in my life,

508
00:24:41.471 --> 00:24:45.105
and Theo's told me, do this, or go this direction,

509
00:24:45.105 --> 00:24:47.405
or encouraged it, let's say,

510
00:24:47.405 --> 00:24:51.109
and I have and it's been hard, it's been challenging,

511
00:24:51.109 --> 00:24:54.883
and I'm thinking, well, why did Theo tell me that, you know?

512
00:24:54.883 --> 00:24:57.765
But it's been the best thing for me,

513
00:24:57.765 --> 00:25:02.023
and it's, you know, I've gained so much for it, or from it.

514
00:25:02.023 --> 00:25:04.323
And so it's really interesting.

515
00:25:04.323 --> 00:25:06.945
Now, they're here, they're teachers, they're mentors,

516
00:25:06.945 --> 00:25:10.809
they're not to give us the answer, we're to find the answer.

517
00:25:10.809 --> 00:25:14.949
But they can give us the path, they can give us the insights

518
00:25:14.949 --> 00:25:19.299
to lead us and to help us along that way,

519
00:25:19.299 --> 00:25:21.185
as true teachers do.

520
00:25:22.495 --> 00:25:26.723
You were saying that Theo doesn't give the answers,

521
00:25:26.723 --> 00:25:29.323
but will essentially give enough information

522
00:25:29.323 --> 00:25:32.129
that a person can make their own intelligent decision,

523
00:25:32.129 --> 00:25:35.397
and that's true, people, human beings are insecure,

524
00:25:35.397 --> 00:25:38.045
a lot of times we want it handed to us on a silver platter,

525
00:25:38.045 --> 00:25:40.987
and that's what I really like about the work of Theo,

526
00:25:40.987 --> 00:25:43.589
is that it's really oriented toward

527
00:25:43.589 --> 00:25:45.843
taking personal responsibility,

528
00:25:45.843 --> 00:25:48.835
toward your own sovereignty and understanding,

529
00:25:48.835 --> 00:25:50.353
if you've seen this in your life,

530
00:25:50.353 --> 00:25:52.377
it's because you somehow put it there,

531
00:25:52.377 --> 00:25:55.115
you have allowed this to develop,

532
00:25:55.115 --> 00:25:57.417
or you have chosen for this to develop.

533
00:25:57.417 --> 00:26:01.601
Is this something that you're seeing a fair amount of now?

534
00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:03.745
I mean, moving forward, a number of years,

535
00:26:03.745 --> 00:26:05.677
kind of a shift in that willingness

536
00:26:05.677 --> 00:26:08.759
of human beings to take more personal responsibility?

537
00:26:08.759 --> 00:26:11.313
<v ->Absolutely, people are really</v>

538
00:26:11.313 --> 00:26:14.049
coming now more,

539
00:26:14.049 --> 00:26:18.419
wanting to have this experience from within.

540
00:26:18.419 --> 00:26:21.895
They have already started having personal experiences,

541
00:26:21.895 --> 00:26:25.575
they're taking their responsibility, they want to grow,

542
00:26:25.575 --> 00:26:27.645
they want to be the best they can be,

543
00:26:27.645 --> 00:26:31.969
and so they're taking the teachings now

544
00:26:31.969 --> 00:26:34.635
and saying, "This is changing my life."

545
00:26:34.635 --> 00:26:37.535
rather than putting it onto Theo

546
00:26:37.535 --> 00:26:39.743
to make the decisions for them,

547
00:26:39.743 --> 00:26:43.975
and that's exciting for me, it's really exciting for me

548
00:26:43.975 --> 00:26:47.379
to see this change, because, in these four decades,

549
00:26:47.379 --> 00:26:51.243
I've changed tremendously, and learned a lot,

550
00:26:51.243 --> 00:26:54.875
and changed within, and it's a continual process of growth.

551
00:26:54.875 --> 00:26:58.327
Every time I do a session with Theo, I get new information,

552
00:26:58.327 --> 00:27:01.547
it's not just static, it's not, you know,

553
00:27:01.547 --> 00:27:04.123
the same old, same old, there's--

554
00:27:04.123 --> 00:27:07.317
as we're ready to hear, there's more information,

555
00:27:07.317 --> 00:27:09.369
more guidance to be given.

556
00:27:09.369 --> 00:27:12.543
And I like what Marcus has to say, oftentimes he says,

557
00:27:12.543 --> 00:27:16.801
"We're only limited by our curiosity and intellect,

558
00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:19.377
"because the answers are there

559
00:27:19.377 --> 00:27:21.631
"if you're willing to ask the questions."

560
00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:25.591
So he's a question-asker kind of guy,

561
00:27:25.591 --> 00:27:28.859
which is great for me, because I'm constantly learning,

562
00:27:28.859 --> 00:27:31.663
I can't think of all the questions,

563
00:27:31.663 --> 00:27:36.381
and like I said, even with personal sessions, I'm learning.

564
00:27:36.381 --> 00:27:39.279
They may say the same thing to somebody,

565
00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:42.959
only in a different way, that I hear.

566
00:27:42.959 --> 00:27:46.801
I can hear it that way, so it's interesting.

567
00:27:46.801 --> 00:27:48.641
<v Regina>Well, now, this would also,</v>

568
00:27:48.641 --> 00:27:50.941
the fact that people are open and they really want

569
00:27:50.941 --> 00:27:53.287
to have their experience and take personal responsibility

570
00:27:53.287 --> 00:27:57.591
also speaks to the original work, from the 80s,

571
00:27:57.591 --> 00:27:59.661
your book, The Fifth Dimension.

572
00:27:59.661 --> 00:28:02.467
And now, at this time, very few people were really

573
00:28:02.467 --> 00:28:05.963
talking about dimensions, and even a smaller percentage

574
00:28:05.963 --> 00:28:09.123
actually had any notion of what that might even mean.

575
00:28:09.123 --> 00:28:12.683
Now, a few were quantum physicists, it was being

576
00:28:12.683 --> 00:28:14.965
bandied about more in the circles of quantum physics

577
00:28:14.965 --> 00:28:18.691
than among human beings on a spiritual level.

578
00:28:18.691 --> 00:28:20.577
So can we talk about that a little bit now,

579
00:28:20.577 --> 00:28:23.409
what came through when you were told

580
00:28:23.409 --> 00:28:25.525
the basis of the book, back in the 80s,

581
00:28:25.525 --> 00:28:28.745
to what you're seeing manifest now,

582
00:28:28.745 --> 00:28:30.585
because they talked about this.

583
00:28:30.585 --> 00:28:33.621
<v ->Yes, they were talking about 2012,</v>

584
00:28:33.621 --> 00:28:35.781
they were the first to talk about 2012,

585
00:28:35.781 --> 00:28:39.921
it was before José Argüelles wrote his book

586
00:28:39.921 --> 00:28:43.557
about the Mayan calendar, Theo was talking about 2012

587
00:28:43.557 --> 00:28:46.777
and the changes and that fifth dimensionary energy

588
00:28:46.777 --> 00:28:50.805
is that energy that would be in place now.

589
00:28:50.805 --> 00:28:53.977
So it was talking about the world changes

590
00:28:53.977 --> 00:28:56.829
and the dimensions are, the third dimension is that,

591
00:28:56.829 --> 00:28:58.903
which is our physical reality.

592
00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:02.493
The fourth, as they stated, was our spiritual awakening,

593
00:29:02.493 --> 00:29:06.429
recognizing that we were more than this physical existence,

594
00:29:06.429 --> 00:29:10.523
that we had souls, that we had intuitive abilities,

595
00:29:10.523 --> 00:29:12.961
and the fifth is the full expression of learning

596
00:29:12.961 --> 00:29:15.655
how to use our masterhood, because Theo says

597
00:29:15.655 --> 00:29:19.289
we humans have always come from a shamanic background,

598
00:29:19.289 --> 00:29:22.507
and that we're going back to that,

599
00:29:22.507 --> 00:29:25.867
to recognizing that power within ourselves,

600
00:29:25.867 --> 00:29:29.685
and they say there are 12 dimensions about the Earth,

601
00:29:29.685 --> 00:29:32.997
six of which we will experience in our lifetime,

602
00:29:32.997 --> 00:29:36.631
in this human body, which is quite profound,

603
00:29:36.631 --> 00:29:40.193
because there's tremendous, we're living longer,

604
00:29:40.193 --> 00:29:43.991
and that's why, our lifespan is longer and getting longer,

605
00:29:43.991 --> 00:29:48.083
so we live many lifetimes in one body now.

606
00:29:48.083 --> 00:29:52.755
So it's a fascinating experience, but if we get too far

607
00:29:52.755 --> 00:29:55.977
out there, we don't stay in the moment of our expression,

608
00:29:55.977 --> 00:29:59.591
and so they're always saying, "Stay present,

609
00:29:59.591 --> 00:30:04.171
"stay in the now," they use "now" very profoundly

610
00:30:04.171 --> 00:30:07.527
in the meditations, because it draws us back

611
00:30:07.527 --> 00:30:10.219
to this moment, which is our true life,

612
00:30:10.219 --> 00:30:12.593
we don't have more than now,

613
00:30:12.593 --> 00:30:14.847
and if we're too far into the future,

614
00:30:14.847 --> 00:30:17.821
often times that throws people into fear,

615
00:30:17.821 --> 00:30:19.755
and if we're too far in the past,

616
00:30:19.755 --> 00:30:22.883
that's sometimes anger and regret,

617
00:30:22.883 --> 00:30:25.781
and so if we're in the now, we pay attention to it,

618
00:30:25.781 --> 00:30:29.229
we recognize that we're living our life fully,

619
00:30:29.229 --> 00:30:33.831
and we can change in that moment,

620
00:30:33.831 --> 00:30:35.787
and that's what I'm seeing people do.

621
00:30:35.787 --> 00:30:37.257
<v Regina>This is more having to do</v>

622
00:30:37.257 --> 00:30:39.727
with that mastery of consciousness,

623
00:30:39.727 --> 00:30:43.639
and this is something that is so bandied about and debated,

624
00:30:43.639 --> 00:30:45.387
and certainly on the Internet,

625
00:30:45.387 --> 00:30:48.861
to know we're ascending into a fifth-dimensional status

626
00:30:48.861 --> 00:30:52.175
where we become light and we all go together,

627
00:30:52.175 --> 00:30:56.683
and that's it, we are now semi-transparent beings,

628
00:30:56.683 --> 00:30:59.949
no need for food and water, and each other, for that matter,

629
00:30:59.949 --> 00:31:02.433
and that's not what you're talking about.

630
00:31:02.433 --> 00:31:04.181
<v ->No, no.</v>

631
00:31:04.181 --> 00:31:08.989
What Theo is talking about, and the teachings are,

632
00:31:08.989 --> 00:31:12.395
is that we become who we are,

633
00:31:12.395 --> 00:31:15.383
we become totally soul-integrated,

634
00:31:15.383 --> 00:31:19.157
meaning that we have the abilities and the awarenesses

635
00:31:19.157 --> 00:31:22.009
to use all the skills that we've had

636
00:31:22.009 --> 00:31:24.629
over lifetimes on this planet.

637
00:31:24.629 --> 00:31:27.233
It's relative to the Earth.

638
00:31:27.233 --> 00:31:29.991
The Earth is one choice of incarnation.

639
00:31:29.991 --> 00:31:32.017
There are billions of choices,

640
00:31:32.017 --> 00:31:34.547
of multidimensional experiences.

641
00:31:34.547 --> 00:31:37.029
This is just one choice, and they say

642
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:41.335
that this choice is about emotions, learning emotions,

643
00:31:41.335 --> 00:31:45.495
and interacting with each other,

644
00:31:45.495 --> 00:31:47.731
and they've also told us that they

645
00:31:47.731 --> 00:31:50.031
learn the human experience through us,

646
00:31:50.031 --> 00:31:53.939
so it's a nice exchange that we have together,

647
00:31:53.939 --> 00:31:56.241
which I like, you know, because somebody

648
00:31:56.241 --> 00:31:59.185
asked Theo one time, "What's in it for you?"

649
00:31:59.185 --> 00:32:00.989
you know, and that's what they said:

650
00:32:00.989 --> 00:32:03.565
"We learn the human experience through you."

651
00:32:03.565 --> 00:32:05.569
<v Regina>What are some of the signatures</v>

652
00:32:05.569 --> 00:32:07.777
that you've been seeing evolve over time

653
00:32:07.777 --> 00:32:09.503
through the information, when people say, oh,

654
00:32:09.503 --> 00:32:11.577
well, for example, "Oh, geez, I've had this

655
00:32:11.577 --> 00:32:15.077
"horrible ringing in my ears," and so on,

656
00:32:15.077 --> 00:32:20.065
that and others, what are some of the hallmark signs

657
00:32:20.065 --> 00:32:23.091
of people shifting their awareness,

658
00:32:23.091 --> 00:32:26.313
or maybe even their density, a bit,

659
00:32:26.313 --> 00:32:28.843
to be able to elevate their frequency,

660
00:32:28.843 --> 00:32:30.867
to open to new information,

661
00:32:30.867 --> 00:32:34.547
what's some of what you're seeing, or they're talking about?

662
00:32:34.547 --> 00:32:38.067
<v ->Well, they're talking about physical experiences,</v>

663
00:32:38.067 --> 00:32:40.137
when the shift happens, sometimes,

664
00:32:40.137 --> 00:32:43.543
oftentimes, it can be a shift in diet,

665
00:32:43.543 --> 00:32:46.853
your digestive system becomes more sensitive,

666
00:32:46.853 --> 00:32:49.871
you have, as you said, the ringing in the ears is a shift

667
00:32:49.871 --> 00:32:53.183
of frequency, sometimes it's a feeling of congestion,

668
00:32:53.183 --> 00:32:55.877
like when you go up in a plane or you go

669
00:32:55.877 --> 00:32:58.681
into a high altitude and your ears shut down,

670
00:32:58.681 --> 00:33:02.453
and then your body has to adjust to that altitude,

671
00:33:02.453 --> 00:33:04.341
it can be similar to that.

672
00:33:04.341 --> 00:33:08.159
I myself at times feel as if there is a band,

673
00:33:08.159 --> 00:33:12.023
like a headband around my head, that's very tight,

674
00:33:12.023 --> 00:33:15.841
and then sometimes I just feel like my head

675
00:33:15.841 --> 00:33:20.809
isn't big enough to contain my insides,

676
00:33:20.809 --> 00:33:25.455
like it's tight inside, like I could just break out.

677
00:33:25.455 --> 00:33:27.767
So there are different things like that.

678
00:33:29.471 --> 00:33:32.691
When this all started happening to me,

679
00:33:32.691 --> 00:33:36.231
and when Orlos came in, in the beginning,

680
00:33:36.231 --> 00:33:40.971
it was quite gentle, because I needed that gentle prodding,

681
00:33:40.971 --> 00:33:43.027
and then when Theo came through,

682
00:33:44.683 --> 00:33:49.653
I felt that intense shift, like I said,

683
00:33:49.653 --> 00:33:52.301
that feeling you get when you hit your elbow

684
00:33:52.301 --> 00:33:56.625
that's uncomfortable, that buzzing sensation,

685
00:33:56.625 --> 00:33:59.777
and I thought, oh, my gosh, I'm not going to do this,

686
00:33:59.777 --> 00:34:02.491
if this continues, I can't stand it,

687
00:34:02.491 --> 00:34:04.905
and I was assured that it wouldn't last long.

688
00:34:04.905 --> 00:34:07.207
Well, it lasted for about a week,

689
00:34:07.207 --> 00:34:11.173
which was way too long in my estimation.

690
00:34:11.173 --> 00:34:16.157
But I haven't had that intense an experience,

691
00:34:16.157 --> 00:34:18.693
they're much more subtle than that,

692
00:34:18.693 --> 00:34:20.993
it's the ringing in the ears or the fullness

693
00:34:20.993 --> 00:34:24.671
or that altitude feeling, or maybe a dizziness,

694
00:34:24.671 --> 00:34:27.985
sometimes you feel dizzy, and I've had,

695
00:34:27.985 --> 00:34:30.265
at different times, where I can sit

696
00:34:30.265 --> 00:34:33.741
and meditate, and I feel like I'm spinning inside,

697
00:34:33.741 --> 00:34:36.777
as if I'm going to just take off through my crown.

698
00:34:38.027 --> 00:34:40.277
So there are different kinds of things

699
00:34:40.277 --> 00:34:41.979
that you may feel, physically,

700
00:34:41.979 --> 00:34:44.555
and that, people get afraid of that.

701
00:34:44.555 --> 00:34:47.451
They think, oh, there's something wrong,

702
00:34:47.451 --> 00:34:49.915
and sometimes people feel congested

703
00:34:49.915 --> 00:34:52.793
or heart palpitations or things like that

704
00:34:52.793 --> 00:34:55.231
when there's the quickening happening,

705
00:34:55.231 --> 00:34:57.899
and they think there's something physically wrong with them,

706
00:34:57.899 --> 00:35:00.261
it's just an adjustment frequency.

707
00:35:00.261 --> 00:35:05.257
<v Regina>And as people start relaxing and embodying,</v>

708
00:35:06.447 --> 00:35:10.427
well, essentially, we're on the path of embodying ourselves,

709
00:35:10.427 --> 00:35:14.013
I mean, connecting with ourselves and knowing ourselves.

710
00:35:14.013 --> 00:35:15.717
What do you see as--

711
00:35:15.717 --> 00:35:18.613
do you have any readings or channelings

712
00:35:18.613 --> 00:35:21.005
that you are particularly fond of in the past,

713
00:35:21.005 --> 00:35:23.123
where a person has opened to themselves

714
00:35:23.123 --> 00:35:25.773
that you'd like to share, could you share a couple?

715
00:35:25.773 --> 00:35:28.073
I love anecdotes.

716
00:35:28.073 --> 00:35:29.913
<v ->It's...</v>

717
00:35:29.913 --> 00:35:31.693
You mean, "ah has."

718
00:35:31.693 --> 00:35:33.351
<v Regina>Yeah, the "ah has," a couple</v>

719
00:35:33.351 --> 00:35:35.513
of "ah has" on this journey of awakening,

720
00:35:35.513 --> 00:35:39.331
because so many people are right on the precipice of it now.

721
00:35:39.331 --> 00:35:42.577
<v ->I'm hearing a lot from people who are doing</v>

722
00:35:42.577 --> 00:35:45.251
the soul integrative work, and they're finding these

723
00:35:45.251 --> 00:35:47.459
little fragmented parts of themselves that

724
00:35:47.459 --> 00:35:49.989
have influenced their lives all along,

725
00:35:49.989 --> 00:35:51.919
and they're bringing them home,

726
00:35:51.919 --> 00:35:54.801
and what a wonderful feeling that is,

727
00:35:54.801 --> 00:35:59.401
that they've gotten the revelation

728
00:36:01.297 --> 00:36:04.885
of the core circumstance that occurred

729
00:36:04.885 --> 00:36:07.879
for beliefs about not being good enough,

730
00:36:07.879 --> 00:36:10.501
not being lovable enough, occurred,

731
00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:14.685
that block them from receiving all their dreams and desires.

732
00:36:14.685 --> 00:36:18.781
So they've realized those core situations.

733
00:36:18.781 --> 00:36:22.001
Sometimes, they can be horrific,

734
00:36:22.001 --> 00:36:25.589
they can be a very abused situation, or not,

735
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:30.327
but it's so personal to them that they'll go, ah,

736
00:36:30.327 --> 00:36:32.857
and I know I've had this experience myself.

737
00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:34.697
"Now I understand."

738
00:36:34.697 --> 00:36:37.325
You know, many people go in and think

739
00:36:37.325 --> 00:36:40.177
they're going to find out that they're as bad

740
00:36:40.177 --> 00:36:43.579
as they think they are, and it's just the opposite

741
00:36:43.579 --> 00:36:46.479
that they find, they find this wonderful being

742
00:36:46.479 --> 00:36:49.837
that's within themselves, and all these little orphans,

743
00:36:49.837 --> 00:36:52.459
or fragmented aspects, want to be heard,

744
00:36:52.459 --> 00:36:54.711
number one, they want to be recognized,

745
00:36:54.711 --> 00:36:57.887
and when you become conscious that they're there,

746
00:36:57.887 --> 00:37:01.381
then your reaction to life changes dramatically,

747
00:37:01.381 --> 00:37:04.189
and I'm hearing a lot about that.

748
00:37:05.769 --> 00:37:08.859
And, in my personal life, you know,

749
00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:10.605
when you look back on,

750
00:37:10.605 --> 00:37:12.815
"Gosh, I'm reacting to the same stimulus

751
00:37:12.815 --> 00:37:15.483
"a lot differently than I used to,

752
00:37:15.483 --> 00:37:18.519
"I don't get angry, or I, you know,

753
00:37:18.519 --> 00:37:21.739
"don't run down the hall and slam the door,

754
00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:24.221
"I stay present in the conversation."

755
00:37:24.221 --> 00:37:26.753
You know, whatever your modality

756
00:37:26.753 --> 00:37:29.861
of protection would be with the little orphan,

757
00:37:29.861 --> 00:37:34.323
we begin to be familiar with how we've been,

758
00:37:34.323 --> 00:37:38.003
and we stay more present with our experience,

759
00:37:38.003 --> 00:37:40.487
so I'm hearing a lot of people's stories

760
00:37:40.487 --> 00:37:44.901
about those kinds of things, which is what it's all about.

761
00:37:44.901 --> 00:37:47.367
<v Regina>Yes, the process of awakening or awareness.</v>

762
00:37:47.367 --> 00:37:49.345
<v ->Consciousness.</v>

763
00:37:49.345 --> 00:37:52.801
<v Regina>Can we talk about some of the larger</v>

764
00:37:52.801 --> 00:37:56.919
energies that are in motion, because,

765
00:37:56.919 --> 00:38:00.581
back in the 80s, there was talking about,

766
00:38:00.581 --> 00:38:03.755
there would be geopolitical changes coming

767
00:38:03.755 --> 00:38:06.053
at this time on the planet,

768
00:38:06.053 --> 00:38:09.759
there would be changes in the way we do commerce,

769
00:38:09.759 --> 00:38:12.383
there would be changes in currencies, and so forth.

770
00:38:12.383 --> 00:38:15.603
This is a very frightening scenario to a lot of people,

771
00:38:15.603 --> 00:38:17.995
but if you don't mind, I would like it

772
00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:21.609
if you would share what Theo has been telling you

773
00:38:21.609 --> 00:38:25.105
over time about what we, as a species,

774
00:38:25.105 --> 00:38:28.653
are striving to move into at this point in time.

775
00:38:28.653 --> 00:38:30.011
<v ->Well, what we're striving for</v>

776
00:38:30.011 --> 00:38:32.495
is peace in the world, ultimately.

777
00:38:32.495 --> 00:38:35.073
Now, we think, oh, that can never happen,

778
00:38:35.073 --> 00:38:37.649
judging from what's going on in the world,

779
00:38:37.649 --> 00:38:41.927
but what they talk about is, as we have the information,

780
00:38:41.927 --> 00:38:44.227
technology has given us the ability

781
00:38:44.227 --> 00:38:47.263
to touch one another's lives globally.

782
00:38:47.263 --> 00:38:49.865
In a second, we can see what is happening

783
00:38:49.865 --> 00:38:53.637
around the world, we see the earthquake in Chile

784
00:38:53.637 --> 00:38:56.443
and the earthquake in Haiti,

785
00:38:56.443 --> 00:39:00.675
and we see the cyclone that hit Malamar,

786
00:39:00.675 --> 00:39:02.929
is that how you pronounce it, I'm not sure,

787
00:39:02.929 --> 00:39:05.827
that we never knew before.

788
00:39:05.827 --> 00:39:09.735
Our technology is such that we can see each other,

789
00:39:09.735 --> 00:39:13.371
and when we begin to learn about each other

790
00:39:13.371 --> 00:39:17.123
and each other's cultures, we become less fearful,

791
00:39:17.123 --> 00:39:20.619
knowledge is powerful, and we become less fearful

792
00:39:20.619 --> 00:39:24.621
of us and them, we can see that a mother loves her child

793
00:39:24.621 --> 00:39:27.793
and doesn't want them to be shot in a war,

794
00:39:27.793 --> 00:39:30.349
or, you know, we can see the devastation

795
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:32.973
of an earthquake and we want to help.

796
00:39:32.973 --> 00:39:36.011
Our nature is to help each other,

797
00:39:36.011 --> 00:39:38.529
and so the technology

798
00:39:38.529 --> 00:39:41.933
will just increase that ability

799
00:39:41.933 --> 00:39:44.325
to communicate with each other around the world.

800
00:39:44.325 --> 00:39:47.249
When we do that, we see our commonalities

801
00:39:47.249 --> 00:39:49.455
and not so much of our differences,

802
00:39:49.455 --> 00:39:53.595
and the us-and-them kind of thing will stop.

803
00:39:53.595 --> 00:39:58.333
But also, Theo talked about in the late 70s, early 80s,

804
00:39:58.333 --> 00:40:02.429
when writing the book, The Fifth Dimension,

805
00:40:02.429 --> 00:40:06.983
that, in 2012, this was a culmination

806
00:40:06.983 --> 00:40:09.951
of fifth dimensionary energy, we would see

807
00:40:09.951 --> 00:40:13.795
political structures dissolving, new political structures

808
00:40:13.795 --> 00:40:17.661
being made in a global way, which is much like the UN,

809
00:40:17.661 --> 00:40:21.801
but stronger in purpose, and communication happening,

810
00:40:21.801 --> 00:40:23.779
and that world leaders would change

811
00:40:23.779 --> 00:40:25.435
and be more communicative.

812
00:40:25.435 --> 00:40:27.689
Now we have President Obama,

813
00:40:27.689 --> 00:40:31.047
and he is not a nationalist, he's a globalist,

814
00:40:31.047 --> 00:40:33.143
and we'll see more and more of that,

815
00:40:33.143 --> 00:40:35.259
a global economic structure.

816
00:40:36.639 --> 00:40:39.333
These are the changes that we will be seeing,

817
00:40:39.333 --> 00:40:41.907
and when we saw this collapse economically,

818
00:40:41.907 --> 00:40:44.577
we saw it didn't just touch the United States,

819
00:40:44.577 --> 00:40:47.013
it touched every country of the world.

820
00:40:47.013 --> 00:40:48.901
<v Regina>It's already a global economy,</v>

821
00:40:48.901 --> 00:40:50.923
we just operate in different currencies.

822
00:40:50.923 --> 00:40:54.053
<v ->And what will come from this is a currency</v>

823
00:40:54.053 --> 00:40:56.995
that will help everybody, because there will

824
00:40:56.995 --> 00:40:59.849
be abundance around the world,

825
00:40:59.849 --> 00:41:04.219
and we'll be using resources together

826
00:41:04.219 --> 00:41:06.243
in a more appropriate way,

827
00:41:06.243 --> 00:41:08.497
so I find it an exciting time, not a fearful time,

828
00:41:08.497 --> 00:41:10.503
because much of this

829
00:41:10.503 --> 00:41:14.347
has been foretold to me,

830
00:41:14.347 --> 00:41:16.029
and to others through the book,

831
00:41:16.029 --> 00:41:18.789
but it's exciting for me to see these

832
00:41:18.789 --> 00:41:20.581
confirmations coming forward.

833
00:41:20.581 --> 00:41:23.551
When The Fifth Dimension came out,

834
00:41:23.551 --> 00:41:26.521
they were talking about

835
00:41:28.163 --> 00:41:31.015
the Communistic countries,

836
00:41:31.015 --> 00:41:35.201
they were talking about the wall in Berlin coming down.

837
00:41:35.201 --> 00:41:39.339
I could not imagine that happening,

838
00:41:39.339 --> 00:41:41.365
but they said this transformation

839
00:41:41.365 --> 00:41:44.269
would begin in the Baltic States.

840
00:41:44.269 --> 00:41:47.811
Well, I didn't realize that Germany was a Baltic State,

841
00:41:47.811 --> 00:41:50.523
until I went there to teach, and I stood

842
00:41:50.523 --> 00:41:52.779
on the Baltic Sea in East Germany.

843
00:41:52.779 --> 00:41:55.217
That was after the wall came down,

844
00:41:55.217 --> 00:41:59.299
but it was so enlightening to me

845
00:41:59.299 --> 00:42:01.139
and exciting to me

846
00:42:01.139 --> 00:42:03.301
to have had that told in the book.

847
00:42:03.301 --> 00:42:07.071
I'm personally going, "How's that going to happen?"

848
00:42:07.071 --> 00:42:08.785
You know, and then it did,

849
00:42:08.785 --> 00:42:11.361
and they said it would be by the people,

850
00:42:11.361 --> 00:42:13.937
and that was exactly what happened:

851
00:42:13.937 --> 00:42:15.575
the people stood up

852
00:42:15.575 --> 00:42:18.935
and Russia bolted,

853
00:42:18.935 --> 00:42:23.075
and all of those Baltic States and all

854
00:42:23.075 --> 00:42:25.973
became their own countries again,

855
00:42:25.973 --> 00:42:29.975
and it's just been a fascinating process

856
00:42:29.975 --> 00:42:34.021
of unfoldment for me, conformationally speaking.

857
00:42:34.021 --> 00:42:35.999
<v Regina>Yes, because it was foretold,</v>

858
00:42:35.999 --> 00:42:37.965
and yet, at the same time, when you look

859
00:42:37.965 --> 00:42:39.437
at where people are right now,

860
00:42:39.437 --> 00:42:41.093
because we haven't quite,

861
00:42:42.423 --> 00:42:46.017
we haven't quite perfected that, the peace portion,

862
00:42:46.017 --> 00:42:50.525
and there is still so much that has not aligned itself

863
00:42:50.525 --> 00:42:54.067
with what we're moving into, that when people hear

864
00:42:54.067 --> 00:42:57.009
the word globalization, global economy,

865
00:42:57.009 --> 00:42:59.725
it's very difficult for people sitting,

866
00:42:59.725 --> 00:43:00.993
from where they are right now,

867
00:43:00.993 --> 00:43:03.661
watching the rampant greed and so forth,

868
00:43:03.661 --> 00:43:05.201
yet comfortable with the notion

869
00:43:05.201 --> 00:43:06.905
that some of these players are the ones

870
00:43:06.905 --> 00:43:10.079
that might be controlling those economies,

871
00:43:10.079 --> 00:43:12.287
and that then it becomes a fear scenario,

872
00:43:12.287 --> 00:43:14.127
and it's hard to see past that into

873
00:43:14.127 --> 00:43:16.595
the little,

874
00:43:16.595 --> 00:43:19.127
perhaps little more distant future,

875
00:43:19.127 --> 00:43:21.795
in which some of this has already come to pass

876
00:43:21.795 --> 00:43:23.635
and has started righting itself.

877
00:43:23.635 --> 00:43:26.717
What can you say about this awkward growth phase,

878
00:43:26.717 --> 00:43:30.259
this adolescent phase that we're in, and it is awkward.

879
00:43:30.259 --> 00:43:32.097
<v ->What's giving your power away?</v>

880
00:43:32.097 --> 00:43:35.043
And that's, people go into fear

881
00:43:35.043 --> 00:43:38.795
because they don't take responsibility for their own lives.

882
00:43:38.795 --> 00:43:40.909
All of this greed that went on,

883
00:43:40.909 --> 00:43:43.257
people jumped on the bandwagon.

884
00:43:43.257 --> 00:43:45.235
You know, it's kind of like, people that knew

885
00:43:45.235 --> 00:43:48.185
they couldn't afford the houses that they bought,

886
00:43:48.185 --> 00:43:51.703
they have some culpability there.

887
00:43:51.703 --> 00:43:54.763
You know, they turned a blind eye because they were

888
00:43:54.763 --> 00:43:57.201
making all this money in the stock market,

889
00:43:57.201 --> 00:44:00.053
and, "Oh, I'm getting all this reward,"

890
00:44:00.053 --> 00:44:02.445
and then, "Oh, it's those guys,

891
00:44:02.445 --> 00:44:05.065
"those guys took advantage of me."

892
00:44:05.065 --> 00:44:09.943
But deep down, we know when something's askew.

893
00:44:09.943 --> 00:44:12.361
We're not victims, Theo said,

894
00:44:12.361 --> 00:44:14.983
"We're not victims here, we're volunteers."

895
00:44:14.983 --> 00:44:16.873
We all volunteered.

896
00:44:16.873 --> 00:44:19.799
We're volunteers here, we stood up and said,

897
00:44:19.799 --> 00:44:22.651
"I want to go there," and so whatever's happening

898
00:44:22.651 --> 00:44:25.731
in our lives, we co-created,

899
00:44:25.731 --> 00:44:28.953
and we have to get off the pity-pot,

900
00:44:28.953 --> 00:44:31.739
we have to not say, "Why me, why me?"

901
00:44:31.739 --> 00:44:33.677
I mean, just--

902
00:44:33.677 --> 00:44:36.187
let's not even ask that question

903
00:44:36.187 --> 00:44:38.669
because it doesn't matter.

904
00:44:38.669 --> 00:44:41.089
What matters is, what are you gonna do about it?

905
00:44:41.089 --> 00:44:43.111
Are you going to take responsibility?

906
00:44:43.111 --> 00:44:46.331
Are you going to pay attention to your own intuitive knowing

907
00:44:46.331 --> 00:44:49.375
or are you going to let somebody else control your life,

908
00:44:49.375 --> 00:44:52.917
and control your finances, and control your choices?

909
00:44:52.917 --> 00:44:56.779
Because then, you know, the blame game stops,

910
00:44:56.779 --> 00:44:59.173
you know, it's, then--

911
00:44:59.173 --> 00:45:01.933
what was it, you know, the statement,

912
00:45:01.933 --> 00:45:04.921
"We have nothing to fear but fear itself."

913
00:45:04.921 --> 00:45:07.683
It holds today, it's true.

914
00:45:07.683 --> 00:45:10.303
<v Regina>Well, we'd have to look if the world at large</v>

915
00:45:10.303 --> 00:45:12.375
is suffering from a particular condition

916
00:45:12.375 --> 00:45:15.345
that it has to be holographic in nature.

917
00:45:15.345 --> 00:45:16.539
<v ->Of course.</v>

918
00:45:16.539 --> 00:45:19.393
<v Regina>We are containing the same elements in ourselves,</v>

919
00:45:19.393 --> 00:45:24.091
when have we not each experienced greedy moments?

920
00:45:24.091 --> 00:45:25.193
<v ->Of course.</v>

921
00:45:25.193 --> 00:45:28.071
<v Regina>Or uncharitable, judgemental,</v>

922
00:45:28.071 --> 00:45:31.299
hateful, violent thoughts?

923
00:45:31.299 --> 00:45:33.923
And so we see this reflected in the world around us,

924
00:45:33.923 --> 00:45:35.261
and it's easy to point fingers

925
00:45:35.261 --> 00:45:36.551
if you didn't pull the trigger.

926
00:45:36.551 --> 00:45:39.817
<v ->Well, Theo says, and I love this statement,</v>

927
00:45:39.817 --> 00:45:42.347
"Deal with the terrorist within,

928
00:45:42.347 --> 00:45:45.501
"and there will be no terrorists without."

929
00:45:45.501 --> 00:45:47.755
And that's where we're going,

930
00:45:47.755 --> 00:45:50.791
as if we come into that wholeness within ourselves,

931
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:53.319
and they, because they're such wordsmiths,

932
00:45:54.599 --> 00:45:57.513
this is another thing that I like, they'll say,

933
00:45:57.513 --> 00:45:59.583
"Come into the wholeness of yourself."

934
00:46:00.783 --> 00:46:02.843
And it's true with wholeness,

935
00:46:02.843 --> 00:46:07.123
W-H-O-L-E-N-E-S-S, wholeness,

936
00:46:07.123 --> 00:46:11.985
it's recognizing the divinity and perfection that we are.

937
00:46:11.985 --> 00:46:14.377
<v Regina>So we need to be</v>

938
00:46:14.377 --> 00:46:16.931
a little bit patient with ourselves,

939
00:46:16.931 --> 00:46:21.531
we need to maybe not be quite as critical of ourselves,

940
00:46:21.531 --> 00:46:25.421
which will in turn eliminate the need to be so critical

941
00:46:25.421 --> 00:46:29.537
of each other, so these really basic principles

942
00:46:29.537 --> 00:46:32.389
that have been introduced on the planet

943
00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:34.599
thousands of years ago, that we're still trying

944
00:46:34.599 --> 00:46:39.061
to grow our way into, are really coming home right now.

945
00:46:39.061 --> 00:46:43.199
<v ->Truly, truly, and you know, as you do your work,</v>

946
00:46:43.199 --> 00:46:45.823
and as your recognize your challenges

947
00:46:45.823 --> 00:46:48.029
as opportunities of growth

948
00:46:48.029 --> 00:46:50.837
and you embrace them rather than resist them,

949
00:46:50.837 --> 00:46:54.379
then it's all about learning compassion.

950
00:46:55.549 --> 00:46:56.983
It really, truly is.

951
00:46:56.983 --> 00:46:59.767
I remember going through a particularly difficult time

952
00:46:59.767 --> 00:47:04.137
in my life, going, "Why do I have to do this?"

953
00:47:04.137 --> 00:47:08.139
And Theo said to me, "You cannot be a teacher

954
00:47:08.139 --> 00:47:11.821
"unless you know from your own experience

955
00:47:11.821 --> 00:47:15.961
"what others may feel," and that's really true,

956
00:47:15.961 --> 00:47:18.673
because how can you--

957
00:47:20.013 --> 00:47:22.981
oh, they said also, "You cannot judge another's experience,

958
00:47:22.981 --> 00:47:26.181
"for you don't know what their soul's path is."

959
00:47:26.181 --> 00:47:29.125
And that's been a huge learning for me.

960
00:47:29.125 --> 00:47:32.343
You know, and it goes back

961
00:47:32.343 --> 00:47:37.197
to that same, "judge lest you be judged,"

962
00:47:37.197 --> 00:47:40.075
it's true, you know, you point the finger at somebody,

963
00:47:40.075 --> 00:47:42.699
you have three pointing back at you.

964
00:47:42.699 --> 00:47:45.761
You know, look at those aspects of yourself

965
00:47:45.761 --> 00:47:48.757
that you're mirroring from another.

966
00:47:48.757 --> 00:47:50.503
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

967
00:47:50.503 --> 00:47:53.493
That's critical, we all do it,

968
00:47:53.493 --> 00:47:56.531
we're all really in varying stages of learning

969
00:47:56.531 --> 00:47:58.737
how detrimental it is to our own soul's growth

970
00:47:58.737 --> 00:48:00.947
to be judging another's experience.

971
00:48:00.947 --> 00:48:04.039
I mean, as reprehensible as we deem someone's behavior

972
00:48:04.039 --> 00:48:06.063
to be, we don't know that that's not actually

973
00:48:06.063 --> 00:48:09.189
quite a leap forward in their own, personal evolution

974
00:48:09.189 --> 00:48:10.547
from a time in the past, perhaps.

975
00:48:10.547 --> 00:48:12.067
You don't know where we are,

976
00:48:12.067 --> 00:48:14.237
no one knows where anyone is on their trajectory,

977
00:48:14.237 --> 00:48:16.137
and even the other way around, someone might

978
00:48:16.137 --> 00:48:17.943
appear to have it all and actually be,

979
00:48:17.943 --> 00:48:19.277
you know, not living up to what their own

980
00:48:19.277 --> 00:48:21.351
personal agreements with themselves are.

981
00:48:21.351 --> 00:48:22.271
<v ->That's true.</v>

982
00:48:22.271 --> 00:48:23.711
<v Regina>There's no point either way.</v>

983
00:48:23.711 --> 00:48:26.655
Just let it be and work on ourselves.

984
00:48:26.655 --> 00:48:28.955
<v ->Yeah, if we focus on ourselves,</v>

985
00:48:28.955 --> 00:48:31.163
the rest will take care of itself.

986
00:48:31.163 --> 00:48:32.733
<v Regina>Yes, I have one other--</v>

987
00:48:32.733 --> 00:48:34.343
now, this is more of an external,

988
00:48:34.343 --> 00:48:36.505
because many people feel that a lot

989
00:48:36.505 --> 00:48:40.427
of the opportunity for this kind

990
00:48:40.427 --> 00:48:43.049
of financial strife on the planet

991
00:48:43.049 --> 00:48:46.407
is tied to energy sources, and if we get our energy sources

992
00:48:46.407 --> 00:48:49.331
squared away, in other words,

993
00:48:49.331 --> 00:48:53.195
something a little more sustainable, for example,

994
00:48:53.195 --> 00:48:56.027
that some of the problems, some of the geopolitical

995
00:48:56.027 --> 00:48:57.729
problems would drop away.

996
00:48:57.729 --> 00:49:00.145
And back when, Theo did talk

997
00:49:00.145 --> 00:49:02.721
about the development of new energy sources.

998
00:49:02.721 --> 00:49:04.561
Any new information on that?

999
00:49:04.561 --> 00:49:06.243
This is just a fun one, because I know

1000
00:49:06.243 --> 00:49:08.451
we're starting to get close to our time here.

1001
00:49:08.451 --> 00:49:12.545
<v ->Well, yes, there has always been alternative energies</v>

1002
00:49:12.545 --> 00:49:14.983
that have brought in new jobs,

1003
00:49:14.983 --> 00:49:16.557
and, as we know,

1004
00:49:16.557 --> 00:49:20.285
technology was one leap for mankind,

1005
00:49:20.285 --> 00:49:23.689
if you would, and now we have the green resources

1006
00:49:23.689 --> 00:49:27.047
or energies, the wind energies, and the solar energies,

1007
00:49:27.047 --> 00:49:29.189
and they were touched on a little bit,

1008
00:49:29.189 --> 00:49:31.305
but now it's becoming more prominent

1009
00:49:31.305 --> 00:49:34.387
and knowing that we need to have these other resources

1010
00:49:34.387 --> 00:49:38.619
and new jobs are being brought forth with that,

1011
00:49:38.619 --> 00:49:41.977
as others drop away that don't serve us anymore.

1012
00:49:41.977 --> 00:49:45.591
So we've had all of these ages of change

1013
00:49:45.591 --> 00:49:47.713
and so this is just another one,

1014
00:49:47.713 --> 00:49:49.323
we don't have to be afraid of it,

1015
00:49:49.323 --> 00:49:53.003
we need to work within it, and with it,

1016
00:49:53.003 --> 00:49:55.073
and be malleable, if you would,

1017
00:49:55.073 --> 00:49:59.627
to changing ourselves and accept it,

1018
00:49:59.627 --> 00:50:03.261
and really looking to other areas

1019
00:50:03.261 --> 00:50:05.699
of work, if we're needing work,

1020
00:50:05.699 --> 00:50:09.333
and enjoying the process of learning something new.

1021
00:50:09.333 --> 00:50:11.403
<v Regina>Yes, any final thoughts</v>

1022
00:50:11.403 --> 00:50:13.381
of maybe a dominant theme or message

1023
00:50:13.381 --> 00:50:15.081
that's emerging right now,

1024
00:50:15.081 --> 00:50:19.315
as the collective asks their questions of Theo?

1025
00:50:19.315 --> 00:50:22.857
<v ->Well, the dominant message of Theo's teaching now</v>

1026
00:50:22.857 --> 00:50:25.387
is the soul integrational process

1027
00:50:25.387 --> 00:50:28.285
of really coming into the wholeness of yourself,

1028
00:50:28.285 --> 00:50:30.861
and that seems a predominant thing,

1029
00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:34.633
and they're teaching to individuals

1030
00:50:34.633 --> 00:50:37.117
as well as groups that they speak to,

1031
00:50:37.117 --> 00:50:40.427
and then the radio show, it always comes back to that

1032
00:50:40.427 --> 00:50:44.181
personal responsibility, and as we take care of that,

1033
00:50:44.181 --> 00:50:46.435
it's like they talk about, really,

1034
00:50:46.435 --> 00:50:49.011
the dealing with the terrorist within ourselves,

1035
00:50:49.011 --> 00:50:51.179
because really all of our fears

1036
00:50:51.179 --> 00:50:54.675
and our emotional reactions are triggered

1037
00:50:54.675 --> 00:50:58.079
by these aspects of ourself that haven't been

1038
00:50:58.079 --> 00:51:01.783
integrated into and and accepted or heard,

1039
00:51:01.783 --> 00:51:06.335
so that seems to be Theo's theme now,

1040
00:51:06.335 --> 00:51:09.741
because that is where the future lies,

1041
00:51:09.741 --> 00:51:11.949
as we come into peace within ourselves,

1042
00:51:11.949 --> 00:51:14.709
we'll have peace in the world and acceptance of each other.

1043
00:51:14.709 --> 00:51:17.101
<v Regina>Yes, and that book</v>

1044
00:51:17.101 --> 00:51:20.393
is called Soul Truth: Guide to Inner Peace,

1045
00:51:20.393 --> 00:51:23.777
and it's available in an audio book, as well.

1046
00:51:23.777 --> 00:51:27.319
<v ->Not as yet, we have some</v>

1047
00:51:27.319 --> 00:51:32.247
that we only have for when we do public speaking,

1048
00:51:32.247 --> 00:51:37.011
but it is at Amazon, or you can go

1049
00:51:37.011 --> 00:51:39.889
to a link on our website, AskTheo.com, and we

1050
00:51:39.889 --> 00:51:43.155
have a link to Amazon which it can be ordered through.

1051
00:51:43.155 --> 00:51:45.777
<v Regina>Well, it seems like it is time to know thyself,</v>

1052
00:51:45.777 --> 00:51:47.479
no doubt about it, and it sounds like

1053
00:51:47.479 --> 00:51:49.595
this is a very useful guide

1054
00:51:49.595 --> 00:51:52.861
in that phase of our journey right now,

1055
00:51:52.861 --> 00:51:55.023
which we're all going through together,

1056
00:51:55.023 --> 00:51:56.587
whether we like it or not.

1057
00:51:56.587 --> 00:51:57.991
Might as well get to know ourselves.

1058
00:51:57.991 --> 00:52:00.297
<v ->We might as well hold our hands.</v>

1059
00:52:00.297 --> 00:52:01.907
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

1060
00:52:01.907 --> 00:52:03.497
Sheila, thank you so much for your time,

1061
00:52:03.497 --> 00:52:05.107
I'm glad we had a chance to finally meet.

1062
00:52:05.107 --> 00:52:07.893
You felt like a friend and sister the moment

1063
00:52:07.893 --> 00:52:11.021
I laid eyes on you, even when I was reading your book,

1064
00:52:11.021 --> 00:52:12.999
I felt like I already knew you.

1065
00:52:12.999 --> 00:52:15.069
But it's good to see each other's eyeballs.

1066
00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:16.677
<v ->It's nice to see you again.</v>

1067
00:52:16.677 --> 00:52:18.243
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1068
00:52:18.243 --> 00:52:21.349
Sheila and her work with Theo have given guidance

1069
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:23.971
to thousands of people over the past 40 years,

1070
00:52:23.971 --> 00:52:26.455
including a then-young and eager Esther Hicks,

1071
00:52:26.455 --> 00:52:29.813
which set Esther on her path to bringing through Abraham.

1072
00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:32.047
Sheila has a weekly radio show in which

1073
00:52:32.047 --> 00:52:34.905
she does live channelings, books, and CDs,

1074
00:52:34.905 --> 00:52:36.883
and does live workshops as well.

1075
00:52:36.883 --> 00:52:39.623
You can find all of her work at AskTheo.com.

1076
00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:42.271
Until next itme, thanks for watching CMN.
