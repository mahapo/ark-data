00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.430
(soft ambient music)

2
00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.348
<v ->There's no shortage of criticism</v>

3
00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:16.649
about the damaging effects several millennia

4
00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:20.127
of patriarchal control has had on the planet its people.

5
00:00:20.127 --> 00:00:21.847
But if we look deeper, can we see

6
00:00:21.847 --> 00:00:24.147
a larger portrait of evolution?

7
00:00:24.147 --> 00:00:27.248
Lucia Rene, author of Unplugging the Patriarchy,

8
00:00:27.248 --> 00:00:29.227
is telling us that these cycles do not occur

9
00:00:29.227 --> 00:00:31.267
by happenstance, that in fact,

10
00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:34.227
there was an agreement on a collective spiritual level

11
00:00:34.227 --> 00:00:36.627
that would allow the masculine to take the lead

12
00:00:36.627 --> 00:00:40.637
and learn the lessons embodied within that experience.

13
00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:53.247
Lucia, this is the book you've written.

14
00:00:53.247 --> 00:00:58.027
Unplugging the Patriarch is a wonderful...

15
00:00:58.027 --> 00:01:00.117
Almost from an adventure point of view,

16
00:01:00.117 --> 00:01:02.736
it has that kind of Celestine Prophecy

17
00:01:02.736 --> 00:01:05.277
Da Vinci Code feeling to it,

18
00:01:05.277 --> 00:01:07.096
except of a very different theme.

19
00:01:07.096 --> 00:01:10.077
It goes into more of the mystical realms.

20
00:01:10.077 --> 00:01:11.356
From everything I understand,

21
00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:15.096
this is more or less a direct reflection of your life,

22
00:01:15.096 --> 00:01:17.336
which you have synthesized, collapsed time,

23
00:01:17.336 --> 00:01:20.336
and so forth, and added a little bit of historical context

24
00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:24.796
to this and that, to make a story out of.

25
00:01:24.796 --> 00:01:28.457
But let's go to your own origins

26
00:01:28.457 --> 00:01:30.856
in terms of the mystical aspect of yourself,

27
00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:32.677
because you're just coming out of the closet,

28
00:01:32.677 --> 00:01:35.437
and it takes a lot of courage to do this.

29
00:01:35.437 --> 00:01:40.376
And you had 17 years, it sounds, of very profound training

30
00:01:40.376 --> 00:01:44.117
under a mystical teacher, or guide.

31
00:01:44.117 --> 00:01:45.556
Can you tell us about that?

32
00:01:45.556 --> 00:01:46.817
Let's just start with that part,

33
00:01:46.817 --> 00:01:49.637
'cause that most impacts your story.

34
00:01:49.637 --> 00:01:51.467
<v ->Well, it most impacts my life</v>

35
00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:55.308
and my multiple lives, because this teacher

36
00:01:55.308 --> 00:01:56.827
was so extraordinary.

37
00:01:56.827 --> 00:01:58.467
We've been together in many lives

38
00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:00.607
and it was very brilliant.

39
00:02:00.607 --> 00:02:02.625
So, he had a number of students,

40
00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:05.435
and I think there were about 75 that stayed

41
00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:09.024
and completed their training with him.

42
00:02:09.415 --> 00:02:10.735
He was a mystical teacher.

43
00:02:10.735 --> 00:02:12.295
He was enlightened, you know.

44
00:02:12.295 --> 00:02:14.815
He was the real deal, a living Buddha.

45
00:02:14.815 --> 00:02:16.194
But he was also a mystic,

46
00:02:16.194 --> 00:02:17.714
which made him very interesting

47
00:02:17.714 --> 00:02:21.534
because he could explain things technically to you.

48
00:02:21.534 --> 00:02:24.215
And because I had been trained as a mystic

49
00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:27.615
in other lives, in Atlantis and ancient Egypt,

50
00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:31.174
I was riveted, listening to these technical explanations.

51
00:02:31.174 --> 00:02:33.715
<v Regina>Yes, the resonance was very powerful for you,</v>

52
00:02:33.715 --> 00:02:36.574
which really made you stick through a lot of stuff.

53
00:02:36.574 --> 00:02:37.755
It was definitely straining.

54
00:02:37.755 --> 00:02:39.424
It wasn't an easy path for you.

55
00:02:39.424 --> 00:02:42.256
<v ->No, he was a very classical teacher,</v>

56
00:02:42.256 --> 00:02:44.886
sort of the Zen master.

57
00:02:44.886 --> 00:02:48.626
So it was more like a military sergeant,

58
00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:51.706
being in boot camp for 17 years.

59
00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:55.465
So once your ego flared up, you were cut down to size

60
00:02:55.465 --> 00:02:59.845
and finally you learned to take that knife in

61
00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:01.825
through your heart and just open up and say,

62
00:03:01.825 --> 00:03:05.996
"Okay, another level of ego being pared away."

63
00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:09.135
So, a lot of people left for that reason.

64
00:03:09.135 --> 00:03:13.055
But everything that I do is for my teacher and his lineage.

65
00:03:13.055 --> 00:03:16.454
They've stood by me for hundreds of lifetimes

66
00:03:16.454 --> 00:03:20.765
so everything I do is for that.

67
00:03:22.115 --> 00:03:23.794
<v Regina>One of the things,</v>

68
00:03:23.794 --> 00:03:26.755
it was somewhere toward the latter part of the book,

69
00:03:26.755 --> 00:03:27.995
that jumped out at me,

70
00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:30.095
and at first, I took exception to it.

71
00:03:30.095 --> 00:03:32.863
As a woman, I took exception to it,

72
00:03:32.863 --> 00:03:34.423
and then I realized,

73
00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:36.801
"Just relax and take this in and think about it."

74
00:03:36.801 --> 00:03:39.081
And it was the same teacher you're talking about

75
00:03:39.081 --> 00:03:41.241
had said, "Why do you think it is

76
00:03:41.241 --> 00:03:45.611
"that there are so few enlightened women?"

77
00:03:45.801 --> 00:03:47.001
And I thought that was interesting.

78
00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:48.680
I thought it was interesting that the person teaching you

79
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.401
was a man, that was teaching about--

80
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:54.379
Really, that was the beginning of your understanding

81
00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.579
of the need to disassemble the patriarchy,

82
00:03:58.579 --> 00:03:59.838
but it was coming from a man.

83
00:03:59.838 --> 00:04:03.219
And so he went on to explain to you

84
00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:04.979
his impression or his understandings

85
00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:09.579
of why women, so few had reached a state of enlightenment,

86
00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.218
in his definition of what enlightenment is.

87
00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:13.618
I think it was the definition.

88
00:04:13.618 --> 00:04:16.258
That's where my mind and such was getting into it

89
00:04:16.258 --> 00:04:19.439
about, well, what is enlightenment anyway?

90
00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:23.120
But going from that perspective, what was he saying?

91
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.578
<v ->Well interestingly, at one point he told a small group</v>

92
00:04:25.578 --> 00:04:27.538
of women, "If I had incarnated as a woman

93
00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:29.518
"you wouldn't have listened to me." (laughs)

94
00:04:29.518 --> 00:04:30.838
<v Regina>(laughs) Probably true.</v>

95
00:04:30.838 --> 00:04:33.118
There would have been competition.

96
00:04:33.118 --> 00:04:35.418
<v ->So, yes it was odd.</v>

97
00:04:35.418 --> 00:04:37.618
I was a complete novice in terms

98
00:04:37.618 --> 00:04:41.058
of my feminist education until I met him in my early 30s

99
00:04:41.058 --> 00:04:43.218
and he was the one that really opened my eyes

100
00:04:43.218 --> 00:04:45.438
and caused me to start reading.

101
00:04:45.438 --> 00:04:47.698
And I began reading about art history

102
00:04:47.698 --> 00:04:51.449
and the matrilinear age, everything I could get my hands on

103
00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.797
of beautiful women who have gone before us

104
00:04:53.797 --> 00:04:58.057
and gotten the vote and all of these wonderful things.

105
00:04:58.057 --> 00:05:01.846
But he, as an enlightened teacher, he said,

106
00:05:01.846 --> 00:05:05.626
"When an enlightened master incarnates in a world,

107
00:05:05.626 --> 00:05:07.586
"they stop and they look around themselves

108
00:05:07.586 --> 00:05:11.626
"and they say, 'What is the greatest need at this time?'"

109
00:05:11.626 --> 00:05:13.527
And for him the greatest need was the enlightenment

110
00:05:13.527 --> 00:05:15.266
of women.

111
00:05:15.266 --> 00:05:19.327
He felt that there was a terrific imbalance

112
00:05:19.327 --> 00:05:23.126
on the planet between the masculine and feminine energies

113
00:05:23.126 --> 00:05:25.446
and that all other imbalances, the wars,

114
00:05:25.446 --> 00:05:29.326
the poverty, the rape, the abuse, the oppression,

115
00:05:29.326 --> 00:05:31.486
all of it is predicated on the imbalance

116
00:05:31.486 --> 00:05:33.746
between the masculine and the feminine.

117
00:05:33.746 --> 00:05:36.557
And that until that is righted, we will never be able

118
00:05:36.557 --> 00:05:38.636
to move forward into this golden age

119
00:05:38.636 --> 00:05:40.536
that we're all anticipating.

120
00:05:40.536 --> 00:05:44.447
So he put tremendous focus on his women students.

121
00:05:44.697 --> 00:05:47.057
He separated us from the men.

122
00:05:47.057 --> 00:05:49.137
He encouraged us to stand on our own.

123
00:05:49.137 --> 00:05:51.877
He wanted us to go into computer science,

124
00:05:51.877 --> 00:05:55.976
not only to strengthen the mind,

125
00:05:55.976 --> 00:05:58.676
the awareness field, but also to learn how to make money,

126
00:05:58.676 --> 00:06:00.857
to take the patriarchy on, and to be able

127
00:06:00.857 --> 00:06:04.615
to work on Wall Street with very powerful stockbrokers,

128
00:06:04.615 --> 00:06:07.216
and for a woman to be able to stand

129
00:06:07.216 --> 00:06:08.716
and not be affected by that.

130
00:06:08.716 --> 00:06:10.716
So it was terrific training, very difficult.

131
00:06:10.716 --> 00:06:12.376
Most of us were really artists

132
00:06:12.376 --> 00:06:15.336
and had no interest at all in making money.

133
00:06:15.336 --> 00:06:17.656
But if you wanted to continue to study with him,

134
00:06:17.656 --> 00:06:19.955
which was my life's desire, then you had

135
00:06:19.955 --> 00:06:21.996
to go with the program, as it were.

136
00:06:21.996 --> 00:06:23.316
<v Regina>In the earthly world.</v>

137
00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:24.526
<v ->Yeah
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

138
00:06:24.526 --> 00:06:27.495
Just to backtrack to where we were

139
00:06:27.495 --> 00:06:29.355
a moment ago, with the question I was asking

140
00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:32.665
about why the rationale--

141
00:06:32.665 --> 00:06:35.554
His explanation for why women didn't take on

142
00:06:35.554 --> 00:06:37.715
the process of enlightenment to the same degree

143
00:06:37.715 --> 00:06:40.456
that men had throughout more modern history.

144
00:06:40.456 --> 00:06:42.705
Can you explain what he had to say about that?

145
00:06:42.705 --> 00:06:44.695
<v ->Because they had been excluded.</v>

146
00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:48.474
So, you know, I was ordained by him as a Buddhist monk.

147
00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:49.909
And in particular he said--

148
00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:54.109
He put on the scroll he gave us, for his women,

149
00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:55.828
"You're ordained as a Buddhist monk.

150
00:06:55.828 --> 00:06:57.589
"I want you to know that I didn't ordain you

151
00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:59.148
"as a Buddhist nun

152
00:06:59.148 --> 00:07:01.549
"because the nuns have been denied

153
00:07:01.549 --> 00:07:03.589
"the full esoteric teachings,

154
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:06.088
"and I have denied you nothing.

155
00:07:06.088 --> 00:07:08.328
"So, you're a Buddhist monk."

156
00:07:08.328 --> 00:07:11.228
So, down through history, women have been excluded

157
00:07:11.228 --> 00:07:14.569
from everything, education, the ability to make money,

158
00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:17.168
to even handle money, to have spiritual educations

159
00:07:17.168 --> 00:07:18.328
and so on.

160
00:07:18.328 --> 00:07:23.189
And of course, 6,000 years ago we had a matrilinear age

161
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:25.548
where women held the reigns of power.

162
00:07:25.548 --> 00:07:28.848
And I think the most interesting realization we came to

163
00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:32.248
that's included in Unplugging the Patriarchy,

164
00:07:32.248 --> 00:07:34.979
is that women actually made a collective decision,

165
00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:39.579
a very deep decision, to hand off the reigns of power

166
00:07:39.579 --> 00:07:41.919
so men could learn about power,

167
00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:44.318
so that women could learn about

168
00:07:44.318 --> 00:07:48.078
men learning about power, including abuse of power.

169
00:07:48.078 --> 00:07:50.078
And this age, the patriarchal age,

170
00:07:50.078 --> 00:07:54.379
has been humanity learning lessons in power.

171
00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:57.118
And it's simply time for women to take back those reigns.

172
00:07:57.118 --> 00:08:02.118
Not in an oppressive way, but in a very egalitarian way.

173
00:08:02.158 --> 00:08:04.158
Power comes through the heart.

174
00:08:04.158 --> 00:08:07.348
It's not of us, it comes through us.

175
00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:10.898
<v Regina>And one of the things,</v>

176
00:08:10.898 --> 00:08:14.877
as I recall, that he was also speaking to you about,

177
00:08:14.877 --> 00:08:19.637
is to begin recognizing the genuine traits

178
00:08:19.637 --> 00:08:21.637
that do exist in men and women,

179
00:08:21.637 --> 00:08:23.717
and not in the stereotypical ways

180
00:08:23.717 --> 00:08:25.097
of what we've known in the past.

181
00:08:25.097 --> 00:08:27.416
And one of the areas he talks about to you

182
00:08:27.416 --> 00:08:30.335
is about the emotions.

183
00:08:30.335 --> 00:08:32.375
Can you go ahead and expand on that?

184
00:08:32.375 --> 00:08:34.875
<v ->Yes, well one night he put a man and a woman</v>

185
00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:38.236
up in front of the student body and he said,

186
00:08:38.236 --> 00:08:40.455
"I want you to psychically scan the woman

187
00:08:40.455 --> 00:08:43.235
"and the man and tell me what their spiritual essence is.

188
00:08:43.235 --> 00:08:46.495
"Not the conditioning that you see on the outer,

189
00:08:46.495 --> 00:08:48.775
"but what is the essence?"

190
00:08:48.775 --> 00:08:51.295
And when we did that exercise at the end of the day,

191
00:08:51.295 --> 00:08:55.175
we said, "A woman's spiritual essence is power

192
00:08:55.175 --> 00:08:58.295
"and a man's spiritual essence is the heart."

193
00:08:58.295 --> 00:08:59.955
It's the exact opposite. (laughs)

194
00:08:59.955 --> 00:09:00.915
<v Regina>Upside-down.</v>

195
00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:01.675
The reverse world.

196
00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:06.044
<v ->The reverse of what is intrinsically natural to us.</v>

197
00:09:06.154 --> 00:09:09.314
So a woman, I think partially because she has

198
00:09:09.314 --> 00:09:10.914
the ability to give birth--

199
00:09:10.914 --> 00:09:13.114
And this is not something that we know here.

200
00:09:13.114 --> 00:09:14.814
It's just held in the body.

201
00:09:14.814 --> 00:09:16.254
It's a complete miracle.

202
00:09:16.254 --> 00:09:19.414
But women know how to pull energy up

203
00:09:19.414 --> 00:09:21.214
from the depths of Mother Earth

204
00:09:21.214 --> 00:09:23.374
and how to hold it in the lower chakras,

205
00:09:23.374 --> 00:09:26.593
our energy centers, the power chakras,

206
00:09:26.593 --> 00:09:28.292
and then to pull it up through the heart

207
00:09:28.292 --> 00:09:31.514
and wield power through the heart,

208
00:09:31.514 --> 00:09:34.112
facilitate power through the heart

209
00:09:34.112 --> 00:09:35.772
in a balanced way.

210
00:09:35.772 --> 00:09:37.772
<v Regina>And take a very unique kind</v>

211
00:09:37.772 --> 00:09:39.533
of responsibility along with that.

212
00:09:39.533 --> 00:09:40.632
<v ->Exactly.</v>

213
00:09:40.632 --> 00:09:42.500
So we are...

214
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.180
Actually, his thought was that women

215
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.040
are less emotional than men.

216
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.581
Women have been taught in this age

217
00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:52.801
that they are overly emotional,

218
00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:55.319
and of course men are taught to shut down

219
00:09:55.319 --> 00:09:56.278
the emotions.

220
00:09:56.278 --> 00:09:57.918
When just the opposite is true,

221
00:09:57.918 --> 00:10:00.298
because a woman intrinsically is power.

222
00:10:00.298 --> 00:10:02.637
She's really very detached.

223
00:10:02.637 --> 00:10:06.758
I mean, we feel, we feel for the desecration of the Earth.

224
00:10:06.758 --> 00:10:07.758
We feel everything.

225
00:10:07.758 --> 00:10:08.778
We want to nurture.

226
00:10:08.778 --> 00:10:09.839
We want to help.

227
00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:12.337
But that's only one aspect of the feminine.

228
00:10:12.337 --> 00:10:14.978
<v Regina>And feeling is different than emotions.</v>

229
00:10:14.978 --> 00:10:16.828
And maybe you can talk about that a little bit,

230
00:10:16.828 --> 00:10:18.477
because it's really...

231
00:10:18.477 --> 00:10:19.096
<v ->Yes.</v>

232
00:10:19.096 --> 00:10:20.997
I'm not speaking about the emotional body.

233
00:10:20.997 --> 00:10:23.317
I mean, we all have an emotional body,

234
00:10:23.317 --> 00:10:26.077
which is rather like a harp that gets played.

235
00:10:26.077 --> 00:10:28.576
But if the egoic structure has been cleared,

236
00:10:28.576 --> 00:10:29.776
then the emotions,

237
00:10:29.776 --> 00:10:33.376
whatever is coming at us in terms of language

238
00:10:33.376 --> 00:10:36.338
or action, it just passes through the harp

239
00:10:36.338 --> 00:10:38.375
and it vibrates, right?

240
00:10:38.375 --> 00:10:41.934
And it points us to something...

241
00:10:41.934 --> 00:10:45.995
But, power, or feeling is quite different.

242
00:10:45.995 --> 00:10:49.054
It's mostly aligned with the heart

243
00:10:49.054 --> 00:10:52.354
and so there's a sense of balance, of unconditional love.

244
00:10:52.354 --> 00:10:56.225
The heart actually has the strength of the lower chakras,

245
00:10:56.225 --> 00:10:59.143
so it's the mother lion defending her cubs.

246
00:10:59.143 --> 00:11:01.704
It has the wisdom of the upper chakras,

247
00:11:01.704 --> 00:11:04.364
the more esoteric chakras, of speaking the truth

248
00:11:04.364 --> 00:11:07.323
and seeing into other dimensions and ascending.

249
00:11:07.323 --> 00:11:09.884
All of these things have been off-limits to women

250
00:11:09.884 --> 00:11:11.404
in the patriarchal age.

251
00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:12.324
You can't go here.

252
00:11:12.324 --> 00:11:14.024
You can't become a living Buddha.

253
00:11:14.024 --> 00:11:15.963
You can't go down and become powerful

254
00:11:15.963 --> 00:11:17.024
or else you're a bitch.

255
00:11:17.024 --> 00:11:19.584
You're really confined here,

256
00:11:19.584 --> 00:11:23.243
and not in the expansive, universal heart

257
00:11:23.243 --> 00:11:25.062
of pure feeling,

258
00:11:25.062 --> 00:11:29.743
but of this contorted inside-out upside-down

259
00:11:29.743 --> 00:11:32.801
limited, finite heart.

260
00:11:32.801 --> 00:11:34.741
<v Regina>With the ideal to be of service.</v>

261
00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:35.641
<v ->Of service.</v>

262
00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:37.677
<v Regina>But not in the broader sense,</v>

263
00:11:37.677 --> 00:11:39.407
the universal sense of the term.

264
00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:42.033
In a more personal sense, to be of service.

265
00:11:42.033 --> 00:11:43.773
<v ->To always obey authority.
<v Regina>Exactly.</v>

266
00:11:43.773 --> 00:11:47.289
<v ->It's the Virgin Mary in the Christian tradition.</v>

267
00:11:47.289 --> 00:11:48.809
<v Regina>And you write at length</v>

268
00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:50.509
about the Christian tradition,

269
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:53.429
and particularly Roman Catholicism, in the book.

270
00:11:53.429 --> 00:11:55.869
This is one of the rings of power that you speak of

271
00:11:55.869 --> 00:11:59.769
and again, if people want to really get a better glimpse

272
00:11:59.769 --> 00:12:01.705
at the whole story, they need to read the book

273
00:12:01.705 --> 00:12:02.925
all the way through.

274
00:12:02.925 --> 00:12:05.505
But, let's focus a little bit on what you learned

275
00:12:05.505 --> 00:12:08.265
in your journey, about a couple of different things

276
00:12:08.265 --> 00:12:11.365
that have been considered the centers

277
00:12:11.365 --> 00:12:14.085
of the patriarchy of the last few thousand years.

278
00:12:14.085 --> 00:12:17.105
And one of them resides in the city of London,

279
00:12:17.105 --> 00:12:19.205
and I found this interesting.

280
00:12:19.205 --> 00:12:23.425
And when this was being viewed on an energetic level,

281
00:12:23.425 --> 00:12:26.265
and this is a lot of what your work was.

282
00:12:26.265 --> 00:12:29.565
First of all, you emerged as a warrior type,

283
00:12:29.565 --> 00:12:34.065
of the various archetypes in your lineage.

284
00:12:34.065 --> 00:12:38.805
You emerged as a warrior, a female warrior, for this time.

285
00:12:38.805 --> 00:12:41.965
And you were also taught to view energies,

286
00:12:41.965 --> 00:12:45.745
and to view deeply into energies.

287
00:12:45.745 --> 00:12:49.345
One of the energies in the book that you expanded on

288
00:12:49.345 --> 00:12:51.625
was this energy that appeared

289
00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:55.146
as a giant squid,

290
00:12:55.146 --> 00:12:58.765
partly organic, partly mechanical in nature,

291
00:12:58.765 --> 00:13:01.365
in and around, under, the city of London.

292
00:13:01.365 --> 00:13:03.444
Go ahead and talk about that, if you would,

293
00:13:03.444 --> 00:13:06.344
and any of the implications.

294
00:13:06.344 --> 00:13:07.435
(Lucia laughs)

295
00:13:07.435 --> 00:13:09.446
I know, that's a discourse that would take hours,

296
00:13:09.446 --> 00:13:11.865
but please, I'd like you to talk about it.

297
00:13:11.865 --> 00:13:13.346
<v ->Well, let's see.</v>

298
00:13:13.346 --> 00:13:16.545
I think it's important to preface talking about it,

299
00:13:16.545 --> 00:13:20.227
but saying, my assignment that I was given,

300
00:13:20.227 --> 00:13:22.445
my dharmic assignment, was to research

301
00:13:22.445 --> 00:13:24.145
what's happening in the world

302
00:13:24.145 --> 00:13:27.605
and then to look beneath the scenes,

303
00:13:27.605 --> 00:13:30.526
behind the scenes, and to identify what the underlying

304
00:13:30.526 --> 00:13:32.306
mystical structure was.

305
00:13:32.306 --> 00:13:35.126
And so I did six months of research.

306
00:13:36.906 --> 00:13:39.175
I wasn't very pleased with the assignment.

307
00:13:39.175 --> 00:13:41.294
I sometimes thought I was going crazy

308
00:13:41.294 --> 00:13:43.955
or had lots of doubt, and certainly lots of fear

309
00:13:43.955 --> 00:13:45.914
that came up, but I began to research

310
00:13:45.914 --> 00:13:47.815
because I was very naive about what was going on

311
00:13:47.815 --> 00:13:49.334
in the world.

312
00:13:49.334 --> 00:13:53.415
I wasn't satisfied with just doing book learning,

313
00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:55.034
the left brain part.

314
00:13:55.034 --> 00:13:56.723
But I would get on a plane and I would travel

315
00:13:56.723 --> 00:13:59.124
to all of the places that I read about,

316
00:13:59.124 --> 00:14:01.403
the World Trade Organization, and the Federal Reserve,

317
00:14:01.403 --> 00:14:04.664
the World Bank, and so on, because as a mystic,

318
00:14:04.664 --> 00:14:06.923
and having some psychic skill,

319
00:14:06.923 --> 00:14:09.904
I wanted to steep myself in the energy there

320
00:14:09.904 --> 00:14:12.103
and I would always ask for guidance.

321
00:14:12.103 --> 00:14:15.323
What is really going on here

322
00:14:15.323 --> 00:14:16.924
at the World Trade Organization?

323
00:14:16.924 --> 00:14:17.963
And so on.

324
00:14:17.963 --> 00:14:21.872
Is this just greed, or what is happening here energetically?

325
00:14:21.872 --> 00:14:24.113
So the book outlines all of that.

326
00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:27.553
But in the end, our perception,

327
00:14:27.553 --> 00:14:29.552
the women that did this collaboration

328
00:14:29.552 --> 00:14:32.773
and the energetic work of not only dismantling

329
00:14:32.773 --> 00:14:36.032
the patriarchy here, in other words the buy end

330
00:14:36.032 --> 00:14:38.132
that we experience to the patriarchy,

331
00:14:38.132 --> 00:14:40.913
having lived in it for 5,000 years.

332
00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:43.733
But to offer to be of service to dismantle

333
00:14:43.733 --> 00:14:46.492
this underlying energetic structure.

334
00:14:46.492 --> 00:14:50.273
It led us to London, because London is operation central

335
00:14:50.273 --> 00:14:53.732
for the power elite in the world.

336
00:14:53.732 --> 00:14:57.433
We basically live, we discovered, in a feudal system.

337
00:14:57.433 --> 00:15:01.073
It's very subtle, and it's not well known,

338
00:15:01.073 --> 00:15:03.172
but it's a feudal system nonetheless

339
00:15:03.172 --> 00:15:05.993
where the masses are merely cogs and wheels

340
00:15:05.993 --> 00:15:10.142
in a giant machine that serves the few.

341
00:15:10.773 --> 00:15:14.473
So we went to operation central.

342
00:15:14.473 --> 00:15:18.033
That was one of the last pieces of energetic work we did

343
00:15:18.033 --> 00:15:20.952
in terms of unplugging things.

344
00:15:20.952 --> 00:15:23.292
I like to use this term unplugging.

345
00:15:23.292 --> 00:15:25.752
In fact, that's where the title of the book came from.

346
00:15:25.752 --> 00:15:26.852
(Lucia laughs)
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

347
00:15:26.852 --> 00:15:28.782
Unplugging the Patriarchy.

348
00:15:28.782 --> 00:15:32.250
<v ->So, I kept being taken down when I was in London.</v>

349
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.510
We were there for seven days.

350
00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.010
Energetically I would meditate

351
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.530
and I would be taken down into this other dimension

352
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.730
and shown something that I couldn't identify.

353
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:44.191
It was so distorted and horrific.

354
00:15:44.191 --> 00:15:46.952
The energy of it was so awful.

355
00:15:46.952 --> 00:15:49.032
And I kept asking, "What are you showing me?

356
00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:51.481
"What am I being shown here?"

357
00:15:51.481 --> 00:15:54.312
And I could see it was sort of like a machine,

358
00:15:54.312 --> 00:15:57.732
but then in the end I saw that it was also organic,

359
00:15:57.732 --> 00:16:01.112
which made it even more horrific.

360
00:16:01.112 --> 00:16:05.728
And it really was something mysticism...

361
00:16:05.728 --> 00:16:07.068
Well, psychic,

362
00:16:07.068 --> 00:16:09.968
being psychic is the ability to perceive things

363
00:16:09.968 --> 00:16:12.048
in other dimensions, and a mystic,

364
00:16:12.048 --> 00:16:14.808
having mystically abilities, is the ability to enter

365
00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:18.268
into those other dimensions and make change there.

366
00:16:18.268 --> 00:16:22.588
So some very astute mystic, who is part of the global elite,

367
00:16:22.588 --> 00:16:24.588
had constructed this some time ago,

368
00:16:24.588 --> 00:16:26.388
some generations ago.

369
00:16:26.388 --> 00:16:30.068
And it really in the end was a fear machine.

370
00:16:31.358 --> 00:16:36.088
Its job was to, among other things, just lace the money

371
00:16:36.088 --> 00:16:39.728
that comes through the city in London.

372
00:16:39.728 --> 00:16:41.789
In the United States we assume everything revolves

373
00:16:41.789 --> 00:16:43.327
around Wall Street, but really,

374
00:16:43.327 --> 00:16:47.168
if you drill back into it, we go to the city in London,

375
00:16:47.168 --> 00:16:48.988
where all of the banks of the world

376
00:16:48.988 --> 00:16:51.605
are housed and so on.

377
00:16:51.605 --> 00:16:54.365
And so the money transits through there, you know.

378
00:16:54.365 --> 00:16:57.325
How do you transit a few billion dollars through

379
00:16:57.325 --> 00:16:59.765
and bring a Third World country to its knees

380
00:16:59.765 --> 00:17:02.184
on the other side of the planet?

381
00:17:02.184 --> 00:17:05.065
And so we were told to unplug this thing,

382
00:17:05.065 --> 00:17:09.584
which the whole system is run on fear.

383
00:17:09.584 --> 00:17:12.565
If we're really honest about this patriarchal,

384
00:17:12.565 --> 00:17:16.065
which simply means male-dominated, society,

385
00:17:16.065 --> 00:17:17.425
it's run on fear.

386
00:17:17.425 --> 00:17:20.225
And so if enough of us just stand up

387
00:17:20.225 --> 00:17:23.126
from the patriarchal monopoly game and say,

388
00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.685
"I don't want to play anymore.

389
00:17:24.685 --> 00:17:25.744
"I unplug from the fear.

390
00:17:25.744 --> 00:17:28.205
"I'm not going to let this run my life anymore,"

391
00:17:28.205 --> 00:17:31.115
then the game ends, doesn't it?

392
00:17:31.115 --> 00:17:33.485
<v Regina>You mentioned a moment ago</v>

393
00:17:33.485 --> 00:17:35.885
that there was an entity.

394
00:17:35.885 --> 00:17:38.445
What you were seeing, was that there was an entity

395
00:17:38.445 --> 00:17:41.985
that had placed this semi-organic semi-mechanical

396
00:17:41.985 --> 00:17:46.985
fear structure, energetically this dynamic, in place.

397
00:17:47.045 --> 00:17:50.885
So you perceived it as what we would term,

398
00:17:50.885 --> 00:17:52.824
one of the power elite?

399
00:17:52.824 --> 00:17:56.364
Once upon a time, or however many generations back?

400
00:17:56.364 --> 00:17:57.564
Is that what you perceived?

401
00:17:57.564 --> 00:17:58.286
<v ->Yes.</v>

402
00:17:58.286 --> 00:17:59.815
I mean, in the story there's someone

403
00:17:59.815 --> 00:18:01.475
I call the man in the South Pacific.

404
00:18:01.475 --> 00:18:03.214
<v Regina>Yes, I was going to get to that.</v>

405
00:18:03.214 --> 00:18:05.055
Why don't you go ahead and take it from here?

406
00:18:05.055 --> 00:18:07.204
<v ->Well, I believe he's a real person</v>

407
00:18:07.204 --> 00:18:09.684
and he's someone that I knew in a past life,

408
00:18:09.684 --> 00:18:12.404
which is why I'm pitted against him.

409
00:18:12.404 --> 00:18:14.975
It's sort of, if I'm the heroine, he's the antagonist.

410
00:18:14.975 --> 00:18:16.531
<v Regina>In this book, yes.</v>

411
00:18:16.531 --> 00:18:18.970
<v ->And so it worked out conveniently for me as a writer.</v>

412
00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.270
But, I think there is a real man

413
00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:26.570
who is extraordinarily astute in terms of

414
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:29.291
lower occultism or mysticism, whatever you would like

415
00:18:29.291 --> 00:18:31.951
to call it, the practice of the dark arts,

416
00:18:31.951 --> 00:18:34.210
using energies for self-service.

417
00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:38.370
And really the problem that we face in the patriarchy,

418
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.990
with this patriarchal elite, is not greed.

419
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.109
It's obsession with power.

420
00:18:43.109 --> 00:18:44.769
When one is obsessed with power,

421
00:18:44.769 --> 00:18:48.489
you literally have side blinders on.

422
00:18:48.489 --> 00:18:51.388
I mean, you can't see for the obsession.

423
00:18:51.388 --> 00:18:54.429
And so for them, it's the rush of power

424
00:18:54.429 --> 00:18:57.888
that comes with this idea that I could control everything

425
00:18:57.888 --> 00:18:59.288
in the world.

426
00:18:59.288 --> 00:19:00.669
And I believe there is such a man,

427
00:19:00.669 --> 00:19:04.528
who's playing all of the other so-called ring leaders.

428
00:19:04.528 --> 00:19:07.518
They're various components of the patriarchy

429
00:19:07.518 --> 00:19:09.179
and they all work together,

430
00:19:09.179 --> 00:19:11.978
and in the beginning they all overlapped and intersected.

431
00:19:11.978 --> 00:19:15.248
And this was, in essence, on an energetic level,

432
00:19:15.248 --> 00:19:17.349
the one world government or the New World Order

433
00:19:17.349 --> 00:19:18.669
that we read about now

434
00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:22.688
that's becoming more and more exposed to the world.

435
00:19:22.688 --> 00:19:24.909
So, very very crafty.

436
00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:27.249
If you play people's egos against each other

437
00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:29.868
then you can make them think they're very important

438
00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:31.728
in terms of the one world government

439
00:19:31.728 --> 00:19:34.249
and maybe you'll have a good position when it all

440
00:19:34.249 --> 00:19:36.229
comes to be.

441
00:19:36.229 --> 00:19:40.328
And so, many different factions working together.

442
00:19:40.328 --> 00:19:41.288
<v Regina>And keep the public</v>

443
00:19:41.288 --> 00:19:42.680
from looking behind the green curtain.

444
00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.368
This is really important,

445
00:19:44.368 --> 00:19:47.428
because when we look at the manipulations

446
00:19:47.428 --> 00:19:52.288
we see it more in terms of the common perceptions

447
00:19:52.288 --> 00:19:54.387
of media for example, telling us,

448
00:19:54.387 --> 00:19:55.538
"Well, the market's up.

449
00:19:55.538 --> 00:19:56.758
"The market's down.

450
00:19:56.758 --> 00:19:57.776
"Look what happened over here.

451
00:19:57.776 --> 00:19:59.735
"It seems to be impacting that."

452
00:19:59.735 --> 00:20:02.796
Really, that's the curtain we're looking at.

453
00:20:02.796 --> 00:20:05.255
And very seldom do people stop

454
00:20:05.255 --> 00:20:09.556
and try to look behind that at the larger forces.

455
00:20:09.556 --> 00:20:13.136
And I think that's what has been served

456
00:20:13.136 --> 00:20:16.135
by the conspiracy community.

457
00:20:16.135 --> 00:20:18.396
I don't like the word conspiracy at all.

458
00:20:18.396 --> 00:20:20.816
It doesn't work for me, but I'm just using it.

459
00:20:20.816 --> 00:20:22.213
Just, that's what people use.

460
00:20:22.213 --> 00:20:25.373
But, to begin identifying the next layer

461
00:20:25.373 --> 00:20:27.854
of what might be motivating these events.

462
00:20:27.854 --> 00:20:30.613
This seems to be where you get to the patriarchy,

463
00:20:30.613 --> 00:20:33.954
where you get to the principles of power and greed.

464
00:20:33.954 --> 00:20:35.453
But there's a layer beyond that,

465
00:20:35.453 --> 00:20:37.274
and you were just talking about it.

466
00:20:37.274 --> 00:20:40.133
The occult practices that even set these in motion

467
00:20:40.133 --> 00:20:42.823
to begin with.

468
00:20:43.214 --> 00:20:47.473
That really is an area that very few people

469
00:20:47.473 --> 00:20:49.364
can glimpse.

470
00:20:49.834 --> 00:20:53.363
<v ->Yes, and I think getting feedback from the book,</v>

471
00:20:53.363 --> 00:20:56.004
which I wrote very reluctantly, because as a mystic,

472
00:20:56.004 --> 00:20:58.363
you don't necessarily want to talk about

473
00:20:58.363 --> 00:20:59.784
the mystical work that you've done.

474
00:20:59.784 --> 00:21:01.142
If you've done the work, it's been done.

475
00:21:01.142 --> 00:21:02.422
The energetic work has been done,

476
00:21:02.422 --> 00:21:05.262
and the benefit, you know...

477
00:21:05.262 --> 00:21:07.141
What happens on an energetic level

478
00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:09.863
will eventually filter down into the physical

479
00:21:09.863 --> 00:21:12.002
and that's the work.

480
00:21:12.002 --> 00:21:13.282
But I kept being told,

481
00:21:13.282 --> 00:21:15.459
"No, there are people that need this information.

482
00:21:15.459 --> 00:21:17.999
"This needs to be exposed."

483
00:21:17.999 --> 00:21:19.199
And so I did write the book,

484
00:21:19.199 --> 00:21:21.659
and now I'm getting emails from women.

485
00:21:21.659 --> 00:21:25.799
Our audience is 98% women probably,

486
00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:27.599
and some men who have worked to balance

487
00:21:27.599 --> 00:21:29.579
the masculine and feminine within themselves,

488
00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:33.879
because it is predominantly a book about female power.

489
00:21:33.879 --> 00:21:36.298
But I get emails from women all over the world

490
00:21:36.298 --> 00:21:38.579
saying, "This resonated.

491
00:21:38.579 --> 00:21:40.158
"I was right there with you on the journey

492
00:21:40.158 --> 00:21:41.638
"and you were doing the book learning

493
00:21:41.638 --> 00:21:43.199
"and you wove that through the book

494
00:21:43.199 --> 00:21:45.529
"and the spiritual teachings and the mysticism," and,

495
00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:47.498
"I've had a few mystical experiences.

496
00:21:47.498 --> 00:21:49.698
"Maybe I didn't know how to label them.

497
00:21:49.698 --> 00:21:52.658
"But now the whole thing is exposed.

498
00:21:52.658 --> 00:21:55.417
"It's as though you popped the hood on the patriarchy

499
00:21:55.417 --> 00:21:57.678
"and showed all the cogs and wheels

500
00:21:57.678 --> 00:21:59.578
"and the way they work together."

501
00:21:59.578 --> 00:22:01.978
And that was the whole point of writing the book,

502
00:22:01.978 --> 00:22:04.818
so that someone could do that, could read it.

503
00:22:04.818 --> 00:22:06.498
Of course when you read something,

504
00:22:06.498 --> 00:22:09.518
then psychically you're mapping to the information.

505
00:22:09.518 --> 00:22:11.817
You're going down beneath the words

506
00:22:11.817 --> 00:22:14.957
and you're feeling what is there.

507
00:22:14.957 --> 00:22:17.298
And someone can feel the various components

508
00:22:17.298 --> 00:22:19.837
because they're all laid out systematically

509
00:22:19.837 --> 00:22:21.757
in diagrams even.

510
00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:24.767
And they can feel how they resonate.

511
00:22:24.767 --> 00:22:26.728
They can feel what their buy ends are.

512
00:22:26.728 --> 00:22:28.887
They can feel what their triggers are,

513
00:22:28.887 --> 00:22:31.708
about money, about industry, and so on.

514
00:22:31.708 --> 00:22:33.228
And they can begin to work with them

515
00:22:33.228 --> 00:22:35.747
in order to clear themselves,

516
00:22:35.747 --> 00:22:39.387
in order to unplug themselves from this sytem

517
00:22:39.387 --> 00:22:42.287
which is now coming unraveled.

518
00:22:42.287 --> 00:22:43.907
<v Regina>Indeed.</v>

519
00:22:43.907 --> 00:22:47.747
And going back again to these particular

520
00:22:47.747 --> 00:22:50.167
energetics that were set in place to begin with,

521
00:22:50.167 --> 00:22:53.347
taking it onto even a more complex level

522
00:22:53.347 --> 00:22:55.208
and going further back, you mentioned a while ago

523
00:22:55.208 --> 00:22:58.128
in this conversation that it was the women

524
00:22:58.128 --> 00:23:00.587
in your discovery, and also I think

525
00:23:00.587 --> 00:23:05.347
your teacher's discovery, it was that the women themselves

526
00:23:05.347 --> 00:23:08.775
had helped put this into motion so that humanity

527
00:23:08.775 --> 00:23:12.495
could begin balancing out and understanding power

528
00:23:12.495 --> 00:23:15.294
in its true form, rather than its abusive form.

529
00:23:15.294 --> 00:23:17.774
And we needed to go through this trial by fire

530
00:23:17.774 --> 00:23:19.214
as a species.

531
00:23:19.214 --> 00:23:20.114
Am I correct in that?

532
00:23:20.114 --> 00:23:21.314
<v ->Yes, because you see,</v>

533
00:23:21.314 --> 00:23:23.374
mysticism is the study of power.

534
00:23:23.374 --> 00:23:25.954
And power has a lot of different aspects.

535
00:23:25.954 --> 00:23:28.354
So when you study mysticism, and we're not speaking

536
00:23:28.354 --> 00:23:31.134
about abuse of power, the negative connotation

537
00:23:31.134 --> 00:23:32.414
that it has today.

538
00:23:32.414 --> 00:23:34.734
We're saying power as energy, as life force,

539
00:23:34.734 --> 00:23:37.414
as qi in martial arts.

540
00:23:37.414 --> 00:23:39.474
So when you study power, you're studying

541
00:23:39.474 --> 00:23:43.854
how to accrue power, how to avoid the loss of power,

542
00:23:43.854 --> 00:23:46.634
how to reclaim it from past lives,

543
00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:50.774
how to transfer it, how to transmute it.

544
00:23:50.774 --> 00:23:55.694
But one part of the study of power is abuse of power.

545
00:23:55.694 --> 00:23:57.914
So, the mystic has to abuse power

546
00:23:57.914 --> 00:24:00.535
to learn that it is not smart,

547
00:24:00.535 --> 00:24:03.914
that one spirals down into lower states of attention

548
00:24:03.914 --> 00:24:05.315
if one abuses power.

549
00:24:05.315 --> 00:24:07.654
It's like the child putting its hand on the stove.

550
00:24:07.654 --> 00:24:10.232
It's a necessary part of growing up.

551
00:24:10.232 --> 00:24:12.712
And then you learn, no, that's not advisable.

552
00:24:12.712 --> 00:24:16.952
So, for women who are intrinsically mystics,

553
00:24:16.952 --> 00:24:19.382
they know how to wield power.

554
00:24:19.382 --> 00:24:23.202
Then what happens is that if they study

555
00:24:23.202 --> 00:24:27.321
all aspects of power, they come into a place of balance,

556
00:24:27.321 --> 00:24:29.832
where, as I said, they can pull the power up

557
00:24:29.832 --> 00:24:32.942
and wield it through the balance of the heart

558
00:24:32.942 --> 00:24:36.992
in a very egalitarian way and a very balanced way.

559
00:24:37.141 --> 00:24:41.122
<v Regina>And yet it took the innate power</v>

560
00:24:41.122 --> 00:24:45.102
of the feminine aspect of spirit to have the strength

561
00:24:45.102 --> 00:24:48.531
to be able to help facilitate

562
00:24:48.531 --> 00:24:50.672
this dark period of history.

563
00:24:50.672 --> 00:24:51.972
<v ->Absolutely,</v>

564
00:24:51.972 --> 00:24:54.672
because we knew that if we didn't,

565
00:24:54.672 --> 00:24:56.871
not everyone would be able--

566
00:24:56.871 --> 00:25:00.072
You see, the Earth is cycling up in my estimation,

567
00:25:00.072 --> 00:25:02.851
so we began at, if we look at the energy centers

568
00:25:02.851 --> 00:25:06.901
or the chakras, at the root,

569
00:25:06.901 --> 00:25:09.422
and we were learning lessons about survival.

570
00:25:09.422 --> 00:25:11.762
That's the way that chakra vibrates.

571
00:25:11.762 --> 00:25:14.522
And then we moved up in the matrilinear era

572
00:25:14.522 --> 00:25:17.362
and we were at the level of the second chakra,

573
00:25:17.362 --> 00:25:20.102
where we learned lessons about birth and creativity.

574
00:25:20.102 --> 00:25:22.082
Now we're here at the navel chakra.

575
00:25:22.082 --> 00:25:24.181
For the past 5,000 years we've been learning

576
00:25:24.181 --> 00:25:26.722
lessons about power, including

577
00:25:26.722 --> 00:25:29.551
right now, abuse of power.

578
00:25:29.681 --> 00:25:33.641
We're beginning to rise up into the level of the heart.

579
00:25:33.641 --> 00:25:37.482
The Earth is cycling up in her energy.

580
00:25:37.482 --> 00:25:41.732
And so, this is where the energy

581
00:25:41.732 --> 00:25:44.482
will reside and vibrate, going forward.

582
00:25:44.482 --> 00:25:47.141
After 2012, that's where we're headed.

583
00:25:47.141 --> 00:25:50.719
So, it's a place of, as I said, unconditional love

584
00:25:50.719 --> 00:25:52.739
and masculine-feminine balance

585
00:25:52.739 --> 00:25:56.849
and wisdom and strength and so on.

586
00:25:56.879 --> 00:26:00.159
And so women in their great knowing and strength

587
00:26:00.159 --> 00:26:03.119
at the end of the matrilinear age,

588
00:26:03.119 --> 00:26:04.279
they said, "Yes.

589
00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:06.659
"We're willing to do this for the learning

590
00:26:06.659 --> 00:26:10.539
"of all humanity, so that we can eventually rise up

591
00:26:10.539 --> 00:26:12.999
"together to the level of the heart,

592
00:26:12.999 --> 00:26:16.169
"and embark on this Aquarian Age."

593
00:26:16.339 --> 00:26:18.677
<v Regina>And this is the collective unconscious.</v>

594
00:26:18.677 --> 00:26:22.878
It wasn't as though women were necessarily

595
00:26:22.878 --> 00:26:24.397
given a vote at that time.

596
00:26:24.397 --> 00:26:27.257
"Okay, ladies, this is how it's going to play out.

597
00:26:27.257 --> 00:26:29.055
"There's a great benefit on the other side."

598
00:26:29.055 --> 00:26:31.675
We are talking about the collective unconscious.

599
00:26:31.675 --> 00:26:34.455
And yet, we all have incarnated--

600
00:26:34.455 --> 00:26:37.473
Most all of us have incarnated as both male and female

601
00:26:37.473 --> 00:26:38.593
throughout history,

602
00:26:38.593 --> 00:26:40.854
although it seems in my observation,

603
00:26:40.854 --> 00:26:44.033
that a being has generally tended to side

604
00:26:44.033 --> 00:26:46.823
more masculine or more feminine

605
00:26:46.823 --> 00:26:48.454
to learn those particular--

606
00:26:48.454 --> 00:26:52.355
And also, maybe their soul in their original lineage,

607
00:26:52.355 --> 00:26:54.536
whatever that may be, aligns more

608
00:26:54.536 --> 00:26:56.716
with that particular principle for the work they're doing

609
00:26:56.716 --> 00:26:58.356
on this Earth.

610
00:26:58.356 --> 00:27:00.916
And so, in essence, if you're saying

611
00:27:00.916 --> 00:27:04.736
that the masculine more aligns with the emotions,

612
00:27:04.736 --> 00:27:07.976
and that the feminine more naturally aligns

613
00:27:07.976 --> 00:27:11.055
with power in the authentic sense of it,

614
00:27:11.055 --> 00:27:13.119
it would seem that it would be appropriate

615
00:27:13.119 --> 00:27:15.677
for the women to have taken this role,

616
00:27:15.677 --> 00:27:18.348
because it could have been damaging--

617
00:27:18.348 --> 00:27:19.638
What I'm seeing in my mind here,

618
00:27:19.638 --> 00:27:21.378
is it could have been damaging

619
00:27:21.378 --> 00:27:22.798
to such a traumatic extent.

620
00:27:22.798 --> 00:27:25.438
It would have taken a lot to recover

621
00:27:25.438 --> 00:27:26.978
for the men being more emotional,

622
00:27:26.978 --> 00:27:29.638
to be put in a similar kind of subservient role

623
00:27:29.638 --> 00:27:32.338
to what has happened with the women.

624
00:27:32.338 --> 00:27:32.937
<v ->Yes.</v>

625
00:27:32.937 --> 00:27:34.439
I think the conditioning for both

626
00:27:34.439 --> 00:27:36.478
is absolutely brutal at this point,

627
00:27:36.478 --> 00:27:39.860
and we're all being asked to throw off our conditioning.

628
00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.239
So, women are trained to be second-class citizens

629
00:27:42.239 --> 00:27:45.740
and to push your way up through that conditioning,

630
00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:49.219
and stand, what I call standing in your power,

631
00:27:49.219 --> 00:27:51.239
which is not standing for something

632
00:27:51.239 --> 00:27:52.999
or something against something,

633
00:27:52.999 --> 00:27:56.099
but standing in a place of balance and integrity,

634
00:27:56.099 --> 00:27:59.709
where the whole polarity of for and against comes to rest.

635
00:27:59.709 --> 00:28:02.890
When you stand like that, then you can move

636
00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.788
the personal self out of the way

637
00:28:04.788 --> 00:28:07.570
and allow the divine feminine, or the divine

638
00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:10.309
which is beyond both masculine and feminine,

639
00:28:10.309 --> 00:28:12.589
to come through and to dictate actions.

640
00:28:12.589 --> 00:28:15.000
Of course we're for things and we're against things

641
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.261
and we're activists and we protest.

642
00:28:17.261 --> 00:28:20.042
I'm not saying that we shouldn't do those things.

643
00:28:20.042 --> 00:28:22.760
But I'm suggesting that there is a way to do that

644
00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.140
from a place of balance and integrity,

645
00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.241
where you're not the doer,

646
00:28:27.241 --> 00:28:31.992
and therefore the action is 100 times more powerful.

647
00:28:32.201 --> 00:28:36.130
And so, the male wounding as well

648
00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:37.490
is extremely deep.

649
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.470
I've asked to go into it, to see it

650
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:41.870
so I wouldn't exclude men.

651
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:45.431
Very, very painful to have shut down the emotional body

652
00:28:45.431 --> 00:28:48.270
and to have been forced into a position

653
00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.510
where you must always be strong

654
00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:53.130
and you can never allow fear.

655
00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:55.951
<v Regina>To have such powerful emotions</v>

656
00:28:55.951 --> 00:28:58.791
that write some of the epic plays and novels

657
00:28:58.791 --> 00:29:02.051
and love songs that have endured throughout history

658
00:29:02.051 --> 00:29:04.391
written by men,

659
00:29:04.391 --> 00:29:06.112
as a little reflection of what's going on

660
00:29:06.112 --> 00:29:08.051
in the emotional body.

661
00:29:08.051 --> 00:29:09.890
It's very interesting, and you can certainly see

662
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:12.200
when you put it together that way,

663
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.741
that with that emotional body being wounded

664
00:29:15.741 --> 00:29:18.061
and the power and permission to do so,

665
00:29:18.061 --> 00:29:21.741
a tremendous amount of havoc can be wrought

666
00:29:21.741 --> 00:29:25.921
on the planet in response to being egoically

667
00:29:25.921 --> 00:29:27.262
or emotionally wounded.

668
00:29:27.262 --> 00:29:28.441
And that's what we see.

669
00:29:28.441 --> 00:29:30.601
That's what we see play out in wars and so forth,

670
00:29:30.601 --> 00:29:34.531
is also a male reaction to that woundedness.

671
00:29:35.522 --> 00:29:38.241
<v ->Yes, this is why I feel that women</v>

672
00:29:38.241 --> 00:29:40.941
are being called to the front lines now.

673
00:29:40.941 --> 00:29:44.981
Really it's up to women to stand

674
00:29:44.981 --> 00:29:47.261
and to basically say--

675
00:29:47.261 --> 00:29:49.641
You know, it happens on the level of consciousness.

676
00:29:49.641 --> 00:29:52.341
It's not something that we have to understand here.

677
00:29:52.341 --> 00:29:54.321
It's not something that we have to communicate

678
00:29:54.321 --> 00:29:56.181
with each other verbally about,

679
00:29:56.181 --> 00:29:58.201
although it's helpful if we do.

680
00:29:58.201 --> 00:30:00.901
But women are being asked to stand in their power

681
00:30:00.901 --> 00:30:02.602
and to collaborate.

682
00:30:02.602 --> 00:30:05.242
And collaboration is a little bit different

683
00:30:05.242 --> 00:30:06.421
than cooperation.

684
00:30:06.421 --> 00:30:08.742
We learned to do that during the feminist movement.

685
00:30:08.742 --> 00:30:10.581
I'll give you this, and you give me that,

686
00:30:10.581 --> 00:30:12.240
and then we can live in peace and harmony

687
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.761
and get things done.

688
00:30:13.761 --> 00:30:16.751
But collaboration is where we all say,

689
00:30:16.751 --> 00:30:19.420
"I'll move my personal self aside

690
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.700
"and I'll allow the divine feminine to manifest

691
00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.841
"and in her wisdom we'll go forward as one.

692
00:30:25.841 --> 00:30:28.350
"One heart and one mind."

693
00:30:30.791 --> 00:30:32.330
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

694
00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:33.630
Yes.

695
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:35.185
I understand.

696
00:30:36.905 --> 00:30:40.634
This requires some really practical deconstruction

697
00:30:40.634 --> 00:30:41.873
as well.

698
00:30:41.873 --> 00:30:45.253
And, this can't be done with force.

699
00:30:45.253 --> 00:30:47.133
Force is what got us here to begin with,

700
00:30:47.133 --> 00:30:48.794
in this situation.

701
00:30:48.794 --> 00:30:51.354
But the deconstruction has to happen nonetheless.

702
00:30:51.354 --> 00:30:53.824
I think what you were saying a moment ago

703
00:30:53.824 --> 00:30:57.843
answers to that, in that it has to come from becoming

704
00:30:57.843 --> 00:31:00.983
a sovereign being, standing in one's own truth,

705
00:31:00.983 --> 00:31:03.504
opening to the larger truth

706
00:31:03.504 --> 00:31:05.043
and the intrinsic power within

707
00:31:05.043 --> 00:31:07.884
to begin flowing through, for men and women.

708
00:31:07.884 --> 00:31:09.924
But we have to focus more on women now

709
00:31:09.924 --> 00:31:11.773
because we have to wake up.

710
00:31:11.773 --> 00:31:15.662
We have to unplug from, as you say, the patriarchy.

711
00:31:15.712 --> 00:31:17.973
But,

712
00:31:17.973 --> 00:31:20.162
let's talk about some of the practical implications

713
00:31:20.162 --> 00:31:23.182
because one of them is for example the church.

714
00:31:23.182 --> 00:31:25.941
The church has been a really devastating force

715
00:31:25.941 --> 00:31:30.322
in keeping the feminine silenced and blind

716
00:31:30.322 --> 00:31:32.141
for a very long time now.

717
00:31:32.141 --> 00:31:34.631
Let's talk about that, because part of the travels

718
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:36.192
took your group to Rome,

719
00:31:36.192 --> 00:31:39.162
and go ahead on that one a bit.

720
00:31:39.571 --> 00:31:41.631
<v ->Well, I was shocked when I read the history</v>

721
00:31:41.631 --> 00:31:42.691
of the Catholic church.

722
00:31:42.691 --> 00:31:44.613
I have nothing against the Catholic church

723
00:31:44.613 --> 00:31:46.311
or against religion in general.

724
00:31:46.311 --> 00:31:49.192
I think religion serves a purpose for many people,

725
00:31:49.192 --> 00:31:52.962
to have rules about what is right and what is wrong.

726
00:31:52.962 --> 00:31:55.840
If that's needed at a certain level of evolution,

727
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.801
that's perfectly fine.

728
00:31:57.801 --> 00:32:00.580
But then at some point, we grow beyond that.

729
00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:04.740
We're gnostic in knowledge and knowledge is within.

730
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:07.651
I think there was...

731
00:32:07.651 --> 00:32:09.711
Well, when I read the history of the Catholic church

732
00:32:09.711 --> 00:32:13.190
it was more like the history of a king,

733
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:14.831
you know, going out and doing battle

734
00:32:14.831 --> 00:32:18.531
to gain lands and wealth.

735
00:32:18.531 --> 00:32:22.450
And so it was very eye-opening to me.

736
00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:24.810
And it comes back to what I was talking about before,

737
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.170
of women just being here.

738
00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:27.030
It's the Virgin Mary.

739
00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:30.011
That's the archetype we've been left with,

740
00:32:30.011 --> 00:32:31.901
which is very limiting.

741
00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:33.990
<v Regina>Over time,</v>

742
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:35.410
and maybe not even a long period of time,

743
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:37.439
because we're watching things...

744
00:32:37.439 --> 00:32:39.179
We're watching day to day, the Catholic church

745
00:32:39.179 --> 00:32:42.019
is being revealed and even the Pope has had to apologize

746
00:32:42.019 --> 00:32:43.800
for the behavior of the priests.

747
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:46.819
We will find out over the next few years

748
00:32:46.819 --> 00:32:49.840
how this is going to play out in terms of the power

749
00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.020
that the church wields.

750
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:54.340
I mean, again, we're talking about these layers.

751
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:59.123
We're looking at the priests that perform services

752
00:32:59.123 --> 00:33:00.663
throughout the week and on Sundays

753
00:33:00.663 --> 00:33:02.950
that we all plug in to for our own need

754
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:06.911
to uphold some moral vision inside ourselves,

755
00:33:06.911 --> 00:33:11.890
versus the power, the politics, the money,

756
00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:15.630
and then going into the deep, deep, deeply rooted

757
00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:20.060
mystical roots of what put that in place to begin with.

758
00:33:20.731 --> 00:33:22.310
And that's a whole other subject.

759
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:24.210
And what did you find on that level

760
00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:27.003
when you were looking at it from the mystical end?

761
00:33:27.003 --> 00:33:29.101
<v ->Well, I definitely think it's one of the components.</v>

762
00:33:29.101 --> 00:33:33.571
We identified nine primary problematic components.

763
00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:37.459
Let's see if I can name them.

764
00:33:37.459 --> 00:33:40.199
Government and military and industry,

765
00:33:40.199 --> 00:33:42.139
in terms of consumerism.

766
00:33:42.139 --> 00:33:44.639
Banking, one of the big ones, with money

767
00:33:44.639 --> 00:33:46.199
that controls everything.

768
00:33:46.199 --> 00:33:48.079
World Bank, which is really a ruse

769
00:33:48.079 --> 00:33:51.575
for a control of natural resources on the planet.

770
00:33:51.575 --> 00:33:55.515
Media, basically a propaganda machine at this point.

771
00:33:55.515 --> 00:33:57.815
Art, in terms of PR, that helps out

772
00:33:57.815 --> 00:33:59.455
with the propaganda machine.

773
00:33:59.455 --> 00:34:02.593
Not art intrinsically, but the way that art is being used

774
00:34:02.593 --> 00:34:04.713
to help facilitate that.

775
00:34:04.713 --> 00:34:09.293
And religion is one of them, because it caps spirituality.

776
00:34:09.293 --> 00:34:12.653
It teaches us that we can't have a direct connection

777
00:34:12.653 --> 00:34:13.873
with the divine.

778
00:34:13.873 --> 00:34:16.993
Indeed, we are the divine in manifest form.

779
00:34:16.993 --> 00:34:20.113
And finally, royalty, which is not so apparent

780
00:34:20.113 --> 00:34:21.693
here in the United States,

781
00:34:21.693 --> 00:34:23.933
but is better understood in Europe.

782
00:34:23.933 --> 00:34:27.433
And so this expresses itself through the royal families

783
00:34:27.433 --> 00:34:30.093
of Europe who have formed this little-known group

784
00:34:30.093 --> 00:34:32.453
called the Bilderbergers.

785
00:34:32.453 --> 00:34:33.793
So, yeah.

786
00:34:33.793 --> 00:34:37.233
They're all problematic in different ways.

787
00:34:37.233 --> 00:34:39.373
Their energies are problematic.

788
00:34:39.373 --> 00:34:42.133
But religion has really been--

789
00:34:42.133 --> 00:34:43.403
It's sort of up here.

790
00:34:43.403 --> 00:34:44.251
You know, you have government,

791
00:34:44.251 --> 00:34:48.951
and government creates a shape, a sort of lid, on society

792
00:34:48.951 --> 00:34:52.811
that says you function within this playing field, right?

793
00:34:52.811 --> 00:34:56.511
And basically it's like a prison camp

794
00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:59.091
and the only reason that we don't perceive it that way

795
00:34:59.091 --> 00:35:02.627
is that we've never been beyond the barb wire fence.

796
00:35:02.627 --> 00:35:04.005
<v Regina>Well, those rules are not for those</v>

797
00:35:04.005 --> 00:35:04.793
who create the rules.

798
00:35:04.793 --> 00:35:06.993
Those are only for the people inside the prison camp.

799
00:35:06.993 --> 00:35:09.213
<v ->Indeed, indeed.</v>

800
00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:12.234
But then you know, the overarching structure

801
00:35:12.234 --> 00:35:14.273
that is put in place, that says, "No.

802
00:35:14.273 --> 00:35:16.753
"You cannot go there," is religion.

803
00:35:16.753 --> 00:35:18.454
That's the one that says, you know,

804
00:35:18.454 --> 00:35:20.224
"You can't ascend up.

805
00:35:20.224 --> 00:35:22.284
"You can't ascend through your crown chakra

806
00:35:22.284 --> 00:35:24.264
"and connect with the divinity

807
00:35:24.264 --> 00:35:25.524
"at the center of the universe."

808
00:35:25.524 --> 00:35:28.044
And you can't go down, because the lower chakras

809
00:35:28.044 --> 00:35:30.124
are off-limits to the core of the earth,

810
00:35:30.124 --> 00:35:33.294
because eventually that forms this beautiful transit,

811
00:35:33.294 --> 00:35:34.502
all the way.

812
00:35:34.502 --> 00:35:36.202
It's like this fountain of light

813
00:35:36.202 --> 00:35:39.202
that comes up through the crown chakra.

814
00:35:39.202 --> 00:35:40.902
It comes down in the pools

815
00:35:40.902 --> 00:35:43.342
and comes back up through the root chakra.

816
00:35:43.342 --> 00:35:45.222
All of this I go into in the book.

817
00:35:45.222 --> 00:35:46.842
So this is what we found.

818
00:35:46.842 --> 00:35:48.640
And we actually visited churches

819
00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.320
and looked at the energetic configuration

820
00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.439
and how the domes had purposely been constructed

821
00:35:54.439 --> 00:35:59.039
in order to hold, in order to take you up to a certain place

822
00:35:59.039 --> 00:36:01.900
and give you this sort of buzz

823
00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.480
and convince you this is religion.

824
00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.080
This is spirituality.

825
00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.059
But the moment your crown chakra tries,

826
00:36:08.059 --> 00:36:10.719
the energy tries, to go up and ascend, no no no,

827
00:36:10.719 --> 00:36:13.609
because there's a dome there to cap it off.

828
00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:14.648
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

829
00:36:14.648 --> 00:36:16.669
Yes, of course.

830
00:36:16.669 --> 00:36:18.428
What about industry?

831
00:36:18.428 --> 00:36:23.428
Because this is the area that hits a lot of women,

832
00:36:24.099 --> 00:36:26.148
i.e. consumerism.

833
00:36:26.959 --> 00:36:31.078
We seem to sublimate a lot of our frustrations

834
00:36:31.078 --> 00:36:33.739
or angers or depression or desire or anything

835
00:36:33.739 --> 00:36:34.918
into consumerism.

836
00:36:34.918 --> 00:36:37.119
What did you learn in this part of the journey?

837
00:36:37.119 --> 00:36:38.739
You and your group learned personally?

838
00:36:38.739 --> 00:36:39.980
<v ->It's a sedative isn't it?</v>

839
00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:42.940
And it's a way we medicate ourselves

840
00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:44.640
to make ourselves feel better.

841
00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:49.360
But we've been so propagandized with this idea

842
00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.640
that satisfaction, the fulfillment of desire

843
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.699
is by buying things.

844
00:36:54.699 --> 00:36:56.640
If I can only have the right house,

845
00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.120
the right car, the right clothes,

846
00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.121
the right shade of lipstick,

847
00:37:00.121 --> 00:37:02.459
then truly I'll be happy.

848
00:37:02.459 --> 00:37:04.960
But you know, when I went to the World Trade Organization

849
00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.439
and I sat there and I asked, "What is happening?"

850
00:37:08.439 --> 00:37:11.618
the phrase came into my mind

851
00:37:11.618 --> 00:37:13.238
that Margaret Thatcher coined,

852
00:37:13.238 --> 00:37:15.079
which was TINA.

853
00:37:15.079 --> 00:37:19.469
"There is no alternative to globalization," right?

854
00:37:19.679 --> 00:37:21.388
And I said, "Is that true?

855
00:37:21.388 --> 00:37:22.578
"Really?"

856
00:37:22.578 --> 00:37:24.018
We've been growing our own food

857
00:37:24.018 --> 00:37:25.737
and making our own clothes for a long time.

858
00:37:25.737 --> 00:37:27.338
Is that true?

859
00:37:27.338 --> 00:37:28.848
And of course the answer is no.

860
00:37:28.848 --> 00:37:32.298
So there's a wave of energy that goes out from that building

861
00:37:32.298 --> 00:37:36.858
that is very tiring, that basically says, "Consume.

862
00:37:36.858 --> 00:37:37.799
"Consume.

863
00:37:37.799 --> 00:37:39.418
"There is no alternative."

864
00:37:39.418 --> 00:37:41.588
And then there's a wave that comes back,

865
00:37:41.588 --> 00:37:44.058
the second ripple that the mystic can see,

866
00:37:44.058 --> 00:37:48.038
which says, "Let's pull all the money.

867
00:37:48.038 --> 00:37:49.589
"Let's pull all the money."

868
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:52.378
It's pure unadulterated greed that comes in.

869
00:37:52.378 --> 00:37:54.398
And the World Trade Organization

870
00:37:54.398 --> 00:37:57.398
is the structure, the organization,

871
00:37:57.398 --> 00:38:01.368
which allows that to happen through industry.

872
00:38:04.097 --> 00:38:05.398
<v Regina>Since the book came out,</v>

873
00:38:05.398 --> 00:38:06.718
you have started--

874
00:38:06.718 --> 00:38:08.438
You've been speaking for a long time,

875
00:38:08.438 --> 00:38:10.597
helping counsel and work with individuals,

876
00:38:10.597 --> 00:38:14.618
but you have started working with larger groups of women.

877
00:38:14.618 --> 00:38:17.158
And you're keeping it to women at this time

878
00:38:17.158 --> 00:38:19.219
because...

879
00:38:19.219 --> 00:38:22.319
You explain to us,

880
00:38:22.319 --> 00:38:25.426
why your work is specifically focusing on women now.

881
00:38:25.426 --> 00:38:29.002
<v ->Well, I think both men and women have very, very important</v>

882
00:38:29.002 --> 00:38:30.242
work to do at this time,

883
00:38:30.242 --> 00:38:33.602
but I think women are on the front lines, as I said.

884
00:38:33.602 --> 00:38:36.523
And that it's necessary on an energetic level,

885
00:38:36.523 --> 00:38:39.722
because my gift is that I can see as a mystic

886
00:38:39.722 --> 00:38:42.922
these large overarching structures,

887
00:38:42.922 --> 00:38:44.442
the structures of the patriarchy

888
00:38:44.442 --> 00:38:46.202
and now the structures of where we're headed

889
00:38:46.202 --> 00:38:48.402
between now and 2012.

890
00:38:48.402 --> 00:38:52.082
And so what I'm seeing, as I part the mystical veil,

891
00:38:52.082 --> 00:38:55.222
so to speak, is that women are being asked

892
00:38:55.222 --> 00:38:58.202
to stand in their power and to collaborate

893
00:38:58.202 --> 00:39:01.442
and that it is creating--

894
00:39:01.442 --> 00:39:06.162
When a woman stands, she creates a beam of light.

895
00:39:06.162 --> 00:39:08.503
It's a strand of luminosity.

896
00:39:08.503 --> 00:39:10.042
So each woman is different.

897
00:39:10.042 --> 00:39:10.862
Each is unique.

898
00:39:10.862 --> 00:39:13.622
Each is a different archetype, if you will.

899
00:39:13.622 --> 00:39:15.283
And she stands on the Earth

900
00:39:15.283 --> 00:39:17.762
and this creates a beacon of light.

901
00:39:17.762 --> 00:39:21.722
And as women collaborate, those beacons of light connect.

902
00:39:21.722 --> 00:39:24.022
And so this is the one heart, one mind,

903
00:39:24.022 --> 00:39:27.902
that's coming into place, that we've been hearing about.

904
00:39:27.902 --> 00:39:30.982
It's a beautiful network of rarefied energy

905
00:39:30.982 --> 00:39:34.802
that will allow us to move as humanity

906
00:39:34.802 --> 00:39:36.122
like a flock of birds.

907
00:39:36.122 --> 00:39:38.242
A flock of birds just knows north.

908
00:39:38.242 --> 00:39:39.522
They know what is correct,

909
00:39:39.522 --> 00:39:42.922
and they all move with one mind there.

910
00:39:43.182 --> 00:39:46.040
So the work of women is to really stand and collaborate

911
00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.800
because when that network of light

912
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.660
becomes strong enough, and we don't know

913
00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.160
how many women that will take.

914
00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.960
We don't know how long it will take.

915
00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.220
We have two and a half years

916
00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.120
and I have every confidence that it will happen

917
00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.440
and generally consciousness happens

918
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.440
in an eleventh hour way, doesn't it?

919
00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.340
<v Regina>Mmhmm, it does.</v>

920
00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.480
Eleventh hour and 59th minute, sometimes.

921
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.340
(laughter)

922
00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:09.558
Which I have a sense, may be that way, but that's okay.

923
00:40:09.558 --> 00:40:10.949
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

924
00:40:10.949 --> 00:40:11.776
Exactly.

925
00:40:11.776 --> 00:40:13.275
Well, we're letting go of time

926
00:40:13.275 --> 00:40:16.146
so there really is no time as things speed up.

927
00:40:16.146 --> 00:40:19.446
And so I think we have all the time we need.

928
00:40:19.446 --> 00:40:20.666
But it will begin.

929
00:40:20.666 --> 00:40:23.905
That network of light will begin to vibrate

930
00:40:23.905 --> 00:40:26.966
in a way that will become more and more evident

931
00:40:26.966 --> 00:40:28.086
on the planet.

932
00:40:28.086 --> 00:40:31.846
And eventually it will vibrate with such an intensity

933
00:40:31.846 --> 00:40:34.785
that if you translated it into words,

934
00:40:34.785 --> 00:40:37.116
it would say, "Enough is enough."

935
00:40:37.116 --> 00:40:38.356
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

936
00:40:38.356 --> 00:40:42.036
And again, going back to...

937
00:40:42.036 --> 00:40:45.236
Even in your workshops, it's only women allowed.

938
00:40:45.236 --> 00:40:48.156
And it's not to be exclusive as much,

939
00:40:48.156 --> 00:40:51.166
from what I can understand, but I've noticed this myself.

940
00:40:51.166 --> 00:40:52.666
When you put a man in the room,

941
00:40:52.666 --> 00:40:55.406
because of the existing paradigm and structures

942
00:40:55.406 --> 00:40:58.066
that have been, women oftentimes will start deferring

943
00:40:58.066 --> 00:40:59.726
to whatever the man's energy is,

944
00:40:59.726 --> 00:41:01.694
what he has to say and thinks.

945
00:41:01.694 --> 00:41:05.754
So it's really to remove that kind of resonance,

946
00:41:05.754 --> 00:41:08.676
so that the women can be free to start really

947
00:41:08.676 --> 00:41:11.615
discovering what their own true feelings

948
00:41:11.615 --> 00:41:13.496
and true knowledge base is.

949
00:41:13.496 --> 00:41:15.436
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

950
00:41:15.436 --> 00:41:18.696
And there are many wonderful female groups

951
00:41:18.696 --> 00:41:20.736
that have been happening for a long time.

952
00:41:20.736 --> 00:41:22.335
But I feel like that's escalating.

953
00:41:22.335 --> 00:41:23.856
You know, we have calls now,

954
00:41:23.856 --> 00:41:26.097
like Women on the Edge of Evolution

955
00:41:26.097 --> 00:41:28.205
where there are 7,000 women.

956
00:41:28.205 --> 00:41:29.484
Imagine that.

957
00:41:29.484 --> 00:41:32.984
7,000 women sign up for one call on a day

958
00:41:32.984 --> 00:41:35.444
and all of their attention is focused

959
00:41:35.444 --> 00:41:37.104
on the evolution of women.

960
00:41:37.104 --> 00:41:39.545
Women on the edge of this thing.

961
00:41:39.545 --> 00:41:43.584
So, yes, it's not exclusive at all.

962
00:41:43.584 --> 00:41:45.545
<v Regina>It's just doing what needs to be done now</v>

963
00:41:45.545 --> 00:41:48.286
to empower a group of people,

964
00:41:48.286 --> 00:41:49.466
a very large group of people

965
00:41:49.466 --> 00:41:51.265
who have not been experiencing their own power

966
00:41:51.265 --> 00:41:52.125
for a long time.
<v ->Right,</v>

967
00:41:52.125 --> 00:41:54.363
and we will come to a time--

968
00:41:54.363 --> 00:41:55.963
I mean, men have their own work to do,

969
00:41:55.963 --> 00:41:57.604
of reclaiming the heart.

970
00:41:57.604 --> 00:42:01.005
But unless women are willing to stand in their power

971
00:42:01.005 --> 00:42:05.114
and create this crescendo of reclaiming feminine power,

972
00:42:05.114 --> 00:42:07.644
men will not be able to react.

973
00:42:07.644 --> 00:42:10.863
It's very important that men be given the opportunity

974
00:42:10.863 --> 00:42:14.244
to react in order to balance out the masculine and feminine

975
00:42:14.244 --> 00:42:15.843
within themselves.

976
00:42:15.843 --> 00:42:18.363
So the kindest thing...

977
00:42:18.363 --> 00:42:22.122
Many women cringe when I say I give women-only workshops,

978
00:42:22.122 --> 00:42:24.961
but the kindest thing we can do for the men in our lives

979
00:42:24.961 --> 00:42:26.581
if we love them and want to help them

980
00:42:26.581 --> 00:42:28.402
through this transition,

981
00:42:28.402 --> 00:42:30.682
is to stand in our power and collaborate

982
00:42:30.682 --> 00:42:32.602
and meet with each other.

983
00:42:32.602 --> 00:42:34.761
I mean, we've been meeting in groups, mixed groups,

984
00:42:34.761 --> 00:42:36.302
for a long time,

985
00:42:36.302 --> 00:42:38.912
and it really hasn't done the trick, has it?

986
00:42:38.912 --> 00:42:41.111
And so, why don't we try something different now?

987
00:42:41.111 --> 00:42:42.411
(laughs)

988
00:42:42.411 --> 00:42:44.312
<v Regina>And yet, at the same time,</v>

989
00:42:44.312 --> 00:42:47.412
some of the women you've been dealing with,

990
00:42:47.412 --> 00:42:49.912
they'll often come with trepidation for fear,

991
00:42:49.912 --> 00:42:52.581
if I stand in my power I'll lose my relationship.

992
00:42:52.581 --> 00:42:55.560
I'm a mother and my stability will be gone.

993
00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.681
Talk to us about that.

994
00:42:56.681 --> 00:42:58.760
<v ->Yes, it's very difficult,</v>

995
00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.841
very difficult for women.

996
00:43:00.841 --> 00:43:05.410
The conditioning is very stringent. (sighs)

997
00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:07.100
So...

998
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:09.950
<v Regina>I mean there's a fear factor</v>

999
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:12.628
that women have to overcome.
<v ->A tremendous fear factor.</v>

1000
00:43:12.628 --> 00:43:15.441
<v Regina>Because what if all these things go away?</v>

1001
00:43:15.441 --> 00:43:17.219
What if the men don't like them

1002
00:43:17.219 --> 00:43:19.558
as they truly are?

1003
00:43:19.558 --> 00:43:21.158
<v ->You know, there comes a point,</v>

1004
00:43:21.158 --> 00:43:23.098
and it came for us in London.

1005
00:43:23.098 --> 00:43:24.848
You know, you were talking about London earlier,

1006
00:43:24.848 --> 00:43:27.349
where we were standing there and realizing,

1007
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:28.149
"My God.

1008
00:43:28.149 --> 00:43:29.768
"I'm a woman who is about to unplug

1009
00:43:29.768 --> 00:43:32.569
"from the entire patriarchal system

1010
00:43:32.569 --> 00:43:34.888
"and yet, I'm in a female body

1011
00:43:34.888 --> 00:43:37.729
"and I have to continue to survive

1012
00:43:37.729 --> 00:43:40.629
"in a patriarchal system, at least until the end

1013
00:43:40.629 --> 00:43:42.509
"of this cycle of time."

1014
00:43:42.509 --> 00:43:44.938
How does one do that?

1015
00:43:44.948 --> 00:43:46.630
But there comes a moment where you say,

1016
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:49.668
"You know, if I don't do it,

1017
00:43:49.668 --> 00:43:50.789
"what will happen?

1018
00:43:50.789 --> 00:43:52.738
"If I don't do it."

1019
00:43:52.738 --> 00:43:54.699
It's worse, because you have to think

1020
00:43:54.699 --> 00:43:56.958
not only of yourself, but you have to think

1021
00:43:56.958 --> 00:43:59.838
of the future generations, for the planet.

1022
00:43:59.838 --> 00:44:02.459
Because in the next two and a half years,

1023
00:44:02.459 --> 00:44:06.118
women have this amazing opportunity

1024
00:44:06.118 --> 00:44:08.619
and that is that we can cycle the energy up

1025
00:44:08.619 --> 00:44:10.438
as high as we want.

1026
00:44:10.438 --> 00:44:13.998
All that I think is going to happen at the end of 2012

1027
00:44:13.998 --> 00:44:17.129
is that the energies lock in place.

1028
00:44:17.499 --> 00:44:20.259
And that's the foundation on which we will start

1029
00:44:20.259 --> 00:44:22.689
to build a new world.

1030
00:44:23.038 --> 00:44:26.019
So, we are definitely moving from point A to point B.

1031
00:44:26.019 --> 00:44:29.058
One cycle is ending and another cycle is beginning.

1032
00:44:29.058 --> 00:44:29.798
No question.

1033
00:44:29.798 --> 00:44:30.708
This is not our job.

1034
00:44:30.708 --> 00:44:32.408
It has nothing to do with us.

1035
00:44:32.408 --> 00:44:34.147
It's the work of Mother Earth in concert

1036
00:44:34.147 --> 00:44:36.609
with Mother Divine, who's here to help balance out

1037
00:44:36.609 --> 00:44:39.418
a predominantly masculine society.

1038
00:44:39.647 --> 00:44:42.387
But we have this unique opportunity

1039
00:44:42.387 --> 00:44:44.487
at this pivotal time.

1040
00:44:44.487 --> 00:44:47.647
And that is not only to move from point A to point B,

1041
00:44:47.647 --> 00:44:51.767
but to move to point C, to move to point G,

1042
00:44:51.767 --> 00:44:55.907
to ratchet it up to point M if we want it.

1043
00:44:55.907 --> 00:44:57.058
Think of it.

1044
00:44:57.058 --> 00:44:58.058
We can do anything.

1045
00:44:58.058 --> 00:45:01.458
We can dream a whole new configuration

1046
00:45:01.458 --> 00:45:04.707
because the energies are in flux right now.

1047
00:45:06.746 --> 00:45:10.386
<v Regina>And dream is a very important word</v>

1048
00:45:10.386 --> 00:45:12.966
because we have dreamed this

1049
00:45:12.966 --> 00:45:16.786
and so it's up to us to dream the next level up

1050
00:45:16.786 --> 00:45:18.926
and the next level beyond that.

1051
00:45:18.926 --> 00:45:23.245
As you say, we have just felt so capped

1052
00:45:23.245 --> 00:45:28.195
in our potentials, in terms of what we perceive as possible.

1053
00:45:28.765 --> 00:45:33.026
So, the dream, dreaming together,

1054
00:45:33.026 --> 00:45:34.716
is really what's going to do it.

1055
00:45:34.716 --> 00:45:36.024
As you say, it's the collective.

1056
00:45:36.024 --> 00:45:38.304
It's the collective feminine essence,

1057
00:45:38.304 --> 00:45:40.264
the principle of authentic power.

1058
00:45:40.264 --> 00:45:43.620
<v ->Absolutely, because each of us participates in the</v>

1059
00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.400
global collective consciousness

1060
00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.620
by virtue of being a conscious being, of course.

1061
00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:52.120
And so, each of us has the ability to make change.

1062
00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:53.360
Change begins here.

1063
00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.700
Change always beings here.

1064
00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:58.200
The most effective way to change what's happening

1065
00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.800
on the planet is to change this.

1066
00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.130
Then, it affects the global collective consciousness.

1067
00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:06.630
So...

1068
00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.280
Change is what's happening.

1069
00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.760
You know, the personal self is extremely challenged

1070
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.140
right now.

1071
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.220
But this is the end of an age.

1072
00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:16.780
This is what it feels like.

1073
00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:18.360
It feels very intense.

1074
00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:21.260
It feels very challenging to the personal self.

1075
00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.580
So, if we draw back to a global level,

1076
00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:26.380
if we draw back into the universal self,

1077
00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:29.500
and we remember, I chose to be here.

1078
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.278
I chose this incarnation.

1079
00:46:31.278 --> 00:46:33.556
This is what we all wanted,

1080
00:46:33.556 --> 00:46:36.296
to experience the intensity of this time,

1081
00:46:36.296 --> 00:46:40.316
because humanity has its back up against the wall.

1082
00:46:40.316 --> 00:46:43.116
The power elite has forced humanity's back

1083
00:46:43.116 --> 00:46:44.096
up against the wall.

1084
00:46:44.096 --> 00:46:46.616
That's the grace of the situation.

1085
00:46:46.616 --> 00:46:48.056
Because now we have the ability

1086
00:46:48.056 --> 00:46:52.656
to make an absolutely extraordinary leap in consciousness.

1087
00:46:52.656 --> 00:46:54.996
<v Regina>A very clear choice.</v>

1088
00:46:54.996 --> 00:46:58.526
We've been operating by default for too long.

1089
00:46:58.536 --> 00:47:02.056
Well, on that note, thank you so much, Lucia,

1090
00:47:02.056 --> 00:47:05.116
for your time and for the number of years

1091
00:47:05.116 --> 00:47:06.692
you've spent doing this journey

1092
00:47:06.692 --> 00:47:08.702
so that you could reflect your words back to us.

1093
00:47:08.702 --> 00:47:09.890
<v ->Oh, thank you.</v>

1094
00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:11.130
Thank you for the work you do,

1095
00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:13.090
for bringing this consciousness to people.

1096
00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:15.200
It's so beautiful.

1097
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:18.270
<v ->Unplugging the Patriarchy is a story</v>

1098
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:20.830
