00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:03.253 line:15% 
<v ->For Tony Redhouse and his talented siblings,</v>

2
00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:05.994 line:15% 
life as Native Americans in Monterey, California

3
00:00:05.994 --> 00:00:07.818 line:15% 
had it's gifts and burdens.

4
00:00:07.818 --> 00:00:09.407 line:15% 
Tony's father made the decision

5
00:00:09.407 --> 00:00:11.967 line:15% 
to see that his children remembered their heritage.

6
00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:14.570 line:15% 
And they've taken this forward into their adult lives

7
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.095 line:15% 
as musicians and healers,

8
00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:18.058 line:15% 
but not without its difficulties,

9
00:00:18.058 --> 00:00:19.955 line:15% 
including struggles with addictions.

10
00:00:19.955 --> 00:00:21.886 line:15% 
Knowing these places inside himself,

11
00:00:21.886 --> 00:00:24.254 line:15% 
Tony has turned his energies to healing others,

12
00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:26.366 line:15% 
including women with addictions,

13
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.731 line:15% 
through his Native American arts and music.

14
00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:34.808 line:15% 
(deep drum music plays)

15
00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:39.816 line:15% 
<v Regina>It's interesting,</v>

16
00:00:39.816 --> 00:00:41.747 line:15% 
things seem to be coming full circle.

17
00:00:41.747 --> 00:00:43.197 line:15% 
Last night at the conference here,

18
00:00:43.197 --> 00:00:44.573 line:15% 
I was listening to Bruce Lipton,

19
00:00:44.573 --> 00:00:46.120 line:15% 
who came on after you,

20
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.253 line:15% 
and you just captivated me with your energy

21
00:00:48.253 --> 00:00:49.512 line:15% 
and wit and humor

22
00:00:49.512 --> 00:00:52.434 line:15% 
and also really grounded understanding of life force.

23
00:00:52.434 --> 00:00:54.855 line:15% 
Bruce comes on from a scientific point of view

24
00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:58.087 line:15% 
talking about our evolution as a species,

25
00:00:58.087 --> 00:01:00.358 line:15% 
because of course, power of belief,

26
00:01:00.358 --> 00:01:02.396 line:15% 
so he's talking about our belief as a species,

27
00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:04.583 line:15% 
which went from animism,

28
00:01:04.583 --> 00:01:07.547 line:15% 
which was the understanding that matter and spirit

29
00:01:07.547 --> 00:01:09.681 line:15% 
have always lived side by side,

30
00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:12.347 line:15% 
and how western civilization has gone through these various

31
00:01:12.347 --> 00:01:15.291 line:15% 
permutations, polytheism, monotheism,

32
00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:17.691 line:15% 
to scientific materialism,

33
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:19.494 line:15% 
and basically what it's saying is,

34
00:01:19.494 --> 00:01:21.126 line:15% 
we're headed right back where the Native Americans

35
00:01:21.126 --> 00:01:22.341 line:15% 
have always been.

36
00:01:22.341 --> 00:01:25.083 line:15% 
Which is back to a form of animism,

37
00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:27.323 line:15% 
but with some technology laid in there.

38
00:01:27.323 --> 00:01:30.127 line:15% 
Why is it, what is it about the way,

39
00:01:30.127 --> 00:01:32.538 line:15% 
the belief systems of the Native Americans,

40
00:01:32.538 --> 00:01:35.034 line:15% 
and we'll get into the work you specifically do,

41
00:01:35.034 --> 00:01:38.372 line:15% 
and this animist nature to it that has endured

42
00:01:38.372 --> 00:01:42.127 line:15% 
past all of these others that seem to be crumbling away?

43
00:01:42.127 --> 00:01:45.177 line:15% 
<v ->Because from my standpoint</v>

44
00:01:45.177 --> 00:01:46.500 line:15% 
and my tradition,

45
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.956 line:15% 
Navajo heritage,

46
00:01:50.436 --> 00:01:54.418 line:15% 
we believe, and what I practice in my life today,

47
00:01:54.418 --> 00:01:57.894 line:15% 
is that we are one with everything in the universe,

48
00:01:57.894 --> 00:02:01.020 line:15% 
and so everything is interconnected.

49
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.092 line:15% 
What I do affects the world around me,

50
00:02:04.092 --> 00:02:05.980 line:15% 
affects the animals around me.

51
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.047 line:15% 
One of the goals that we try to attain

52
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.064 line:15% 
in life is to be in harmony with the universe.

53
00:02:16.155 --> 00:02:17.211 line:15% 
In fact that's

54
00:02:17.211 --> 00:02:18.064 line:15% 
hozhoni,

55
00:02:18.064 --> 00:02:21.051 line:15% 
that's a word that means beauty,

56
00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:23.429 line:15% 
it means being in balance, being in harmony

57
00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:24.891 line:15% 
with everything.

58
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:28.037 line:15% 
That means being in pulse, being in time,

59
00:02:28.037 --> 00:02:30.096 line:15% 
having the same intention,

60
00:02:30.096 --> 00:02:31.737 line:15% 
of being at peace with each other

61
00:02:31.737 --> 00:02:33.957 line:15% 
and with all the animals.

62
00:02:33.957 --> 00:02:38.326 line:15% 
I believe that we are connected energetically

63
00:02:38.326 --> 00:02:40.687 line:15% 
with everything around us.

64
00:02:40.687 --> 00:02:44.367 line:15% 
And in that way, there is no separation.

65
00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:47.855 line:15% 
I think that that's what we're finding today,

66
00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:49.337 line:15% 
we're finding in the universe,

67
00:02:49.337 --> 00:02:50.660 line:15% 
we're finding that the things that we're doing

68
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.361 line:15% 
that are harmful to the environment, to the animals,

69
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:57.272 line:15% 
animal rights, all these things are coming up,

70
00:02:57.272 --> 00:03:00.354 line:15% 
we're seeing that what we're doing is

71
00:03:00.354 --> 00:03:03.502 line:15% 
having a little back lash on ourselves.

72
00:03:03.502 --> 00:03:05.656 line:15% 
Because we are not in harmony,

73
00:03:05.656 --> 00:03:07.853 line:15% 
and that goes back,

74
00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:08.504 line:15% 
for me,

75
00:03:08.504 --> 00:03:11.981 line:15% 
to the balance in my personal life.

76
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:13.665 line:15% 
We have personal balance

77
00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:15.960 line:15% 
and that results in all of us connecting together,

78
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.869 line:15% 
then creating harmony.

79
00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:20.535 line:15% 
<v Regina>Just a statement that you've made,</v>

80
00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:22.402 line:15% 
it's taking all these researchers

81
00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.450 line:15% 
and all these universities and studying

82
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.767 line:15% 
quantum physics and non locality and everything else

83
00:03:27.767 --> 00:03:31.212 line:15% 
to come to the understanding that what you just said

84
00:03:31.212 --> 00:03:33.548 line:15% 
has basis in fact.

85
00:03:33.548 --> 00:03:35.702 line:15% 
That we are all entangled,

86
00:03:35.702 --> 00:03:37.356 line:15% 
we are all one.

87
00:03:37.356 --> 00:03:40.950 line:15% 
This gets into some really interesting dilemmas

88
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.936 line:15% 
in terms of the ego of western civilization,

89
00:03:43.936 --> 00:03:46.635 line:15% 
everybody wanting to be an individual,

90
00:03:46.635 --> 00:03:49.931 line:15% 
to be recognized as an individual,

91
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:54.154 line:15% 
how does individuality play into the belief that

92
00:03:54.154 --> 00:03:58.154 line:15% 
we are all one and what one does impacts the whole?

93
00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:00.330 line:15% 
<v ->Each person is unique,</v>

94
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.637 line:15% 
if you take, for instance, a Native American dancer

95
00:04:03.637 --> 00:04:06.708 line:15% 
you go to a gathering, like a pow wow

96
00:04:06.708 --> 00:04:08.831 line:15% 
or a ceremony,

97
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:12.041 line:15% 
you will see the regalia, the different bead work,

98
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:16.260 line:15% 
the colors, the symbols that they are representing

99
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.780 line:15% 
that they're making those things by hand,

100
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.732 line:15% 
they're making things that are traditionally

101
00:04:22.732 --> 00:04:25.046 line:15% 
reflecting what's in their soul,

102
00:04:25.046 --> 00:04:27.201 line:15% 
their personality, their experience,

103
00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:30.933 line:15% 
their life path, their ups and downs.

104
00:04:30.933 --> 00:04:34.998 line:15% 
Everything is expressed in what you are wearing

105
00:04:34.998 --> 00:04:37.951 line:15% 
and so there is a uniqueness.

106
00:04:37.951 --> 00:04:41.280 line:15% 
One dancer is gonna have, maybe, the background

107
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.594 line:15% 
of all this bead work, like mine, is blue.

108
00:04:43.594 --> 00:04:44.810 line:15% 
Okay?

109
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.671 line:15% 
Which represented my quest for freedom,

110
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:51.541 line:15% 
my desire to spread my wings,

111
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:56.377 line:15% 
to be able to reach all the dreams and aspirations

112
00:04:56.458 --> 00:04:58.068 line:15% 
that I wanted to soar to the heavens.

113
00:04:58.068 --> 00:05:00.991 line:15% 
The blue represents something in the universe,

114
00:05:00.991 --> 00:05:02.313 line:15% 
it represents the sky,

115
00:05:02.313 --> 00:05:04.040 line:15% 
represents the ocean,

116
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.302 line:15% 
large expanses of space,

117
00:05:06.302 --> 00:05:08.041 line:15% 
where you are not cluttererd

118
00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:09.363 line:15% 
and you are not confined.

119
00:05:09.363 --> 00:05:11.091 line:15% 
<v Regina>That's your unique expression.</v>

120
00:05:11.091 --> 00:05:13.022 line:15% 
<v ->That was my unique expression of my beadwork</v>

121
00:05:13.022 --> 00:05:14.248 line:15% 
what I was wearing,

122
00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:18.072 line:15% 
and so that unique expression of me

123
00:05:18.092 --> 00:05:22.914 line:15% 
is very valuable in the whole circle

124
00:05:23.315 --> 00:05:24.114 line:15% 
called the universe,

125
00:05:24.114 --> 00:05:26.813 line:15% 
a circle of circles is called a universe,

126
00:05:26.813 --> 00:05:28.498 line:15% 
I am an individual circle.

127
00:05:28.498 --> 00:05:30.269 line:15% 
An individual hoop.

128
00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:32.541 line:15% 
As a hoop dancer, I connect hoops together,

129
00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:33.906 line:15% 
they create designs,

130
00:05:33.906 --> 00:05:35.633 line:15% 
but as an individual cycle,

131
00:05:35.633 --> 00:05:37.820 line:15% 
or circle, or hoop of life,

132
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.841 line:15% 
I have different experiences in my life story,

133
00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:43.942 line:15% 
different encounters,

134
00:05:43.942 --> 00:05:45.884 line:15% 
and those are valuable

135
00:05:45.884 --> 00:05:48.838 line:15% 
because they will inspire other people

136
00:05:48.838 --> 00:05:50.257 line:15% 
in their circles of life,

137
00:05:50.257 --> 00:05:54.363 line:15% 
in their different paths

138
00:05:54.363 --> 00:05:55.761 line:15% 
that they are on,

139
00:05:55.761 --> 00:05:57.286 line:15% 
but in a larger sense,

140
00:05:57.286 --> 00:06:01.690 line:15% 
that uniqueness, with my strengths and my weaknesses,

141
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.419 line:15% 
not just my strengths,

142
00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.371 line:15% 
but my weaknesses also,

143
00:06:05.371 --> 00:06:08.379 line:15% 
if you take a large circle of people,

144
00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:09.925 line:15% 
and you place them in a circle

145
00:06:09.925 --> 00:06:11.546 line:15% 
and they're holding hands standing together

146
00:06:11.546 --> 00:06:12.933 line:15% 
facing each other,

147
00:06:12.933 --> 00:06:14.959 line:15% 
one person on one side of the circle

148
00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:17.541 line:15% 
is gonna have a unique life,

149
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:21.359 line:15% 
their strengths, their weaknesses.

150
00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:22.820 line:15% 
Well guess what?

151
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.932 line:15% 
Somebody on the other side of the circle

152
00:06:24.932 --> 00:06:25.807 line:15% 
across the room

153
00:06:25.807 --> 00:06:29.327 line:15% 
is gonna have the strengths in their life

154
00:06:29.327 --> 00:06:32.270 line:15% 
that the other person has weakness in.

155
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.990 line:15% 
And the other person on the other side of the circle

156
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.454 line:15% 
is gonna have weaknesses in their life

157
00:06:37.454 --> 00:06:40.622 line:15% 
that are gonna be balanced out by this person

158
00:06:40.622 --> 00:06:43.160 line:15% 
on this side of the circle who has strengths.

159
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.805 line:15% 
So our uniqueness is valuable

160
00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:48.376 line:15% 
because it will balance out

161
00:06:48.376 --> 00:06:49.624 line:15% 
<v Regina>It creates a whole</v>
<v ->the big circle</v>

162
00:06:49.624 --> 00:06:54.119 line:15% 
Yeah, the whole circle is balanced out

163
00:06:54.584 --> 00:06:56.506 line:15% 
by each of our uniqueness,

164
00:06:56.506 --> 00:06:58.095 line:15% 
so we don't want to change our uniqueness,

165
00:06:58.095 --> 00:07:01.018 line:15% 
but we want to connect to the circle in harmony,

166
00:07:01.018 --> 00:07:03.257 line:15% 
bringing everything that we are.

167
00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:04.121 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

168
00:07:04.121 --> 00:07:06.223 line:15% 
Now you were raised this way,

169
00:07:06.223 --> 00:07:08.174 line:15% 
you had the advantage of being raised

170
00:07:08.174 --> 00:07:10.585 line:15% 
by a father who still understood

171
00:07:10.585 --> 00:07:12.825 line:15% 
a lot of the traditions and carried them with him.

172
00:07:12.825 --> 00:07:14.361 line:15% 
It sounds like in your family

173
00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:17.145 line:15% 
it very much went through all of the art forms.

174
00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:20.355 line:15% 
What was passed on to you and all of your brothers?

175
00:07:20.355 --> 00:07:21.838 line:15% 
<v ->What was passed on to me,</v>

176
00:07:21.838 --> 00:07:24.174 line:15% 
we began as children,

177
00:07:24.174 --> 00:07:26.595 line:15% 
my father was very much,

178
00:07:26.595 --> 00:07:28.930 line:15% 
well, in fact, I was the start.

179
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.456 line:15% 
When I was five years old,

180
00:07:30.456 --> 00:07:32.695 line:15% 
my father and mother entered me

181
00:07:32.695 --> 00:07:37.191 line:15% 
into an international child's pageant in Monterey, California

182
00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:39.373 line:15% 
in an auditorium.

183
00:07:39.373 --> 00:07:41.612 line:15% 
They made regalia for me

184
00:07:41.612 --> 00:07:42.732 line:15% 
with a breech cloth,

185
00:07:42.732 --> 00:07:45.185 line:15% 
with a vest, with arm bands,

186
00:07:45.185 --> 00:07:48.887 line:15% 
with a headdress and with a little drum in my hand.

187
00:07:48.887 --> 00:07:52.641 line:15% 
And my dad stood behind me in a three piece suit,

188
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:54.230 line:15% 
he was with the civil service,

189
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:55.606 line:15% 
and he stood behind me,

190
00:07:55.606 --> 00:07:57.451 line:15% 
and next to me, there was a little

191
00:07:57.451 --> 00:07:59.350 line:15% 
Spanish matador boy,

192
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.440 line:15% 
with his mom standing behind him

193
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.126 line:15% 
representing the Spanish culture.

194
00:08:03.126 --> 00:08:04.928 line:15% 
I was representing the Native American culture,

195
00:08:04.928 --> 00:08:07.435 line:15% 
and so I was placed on stage

196
00:08:07.435 --> 00:08:09.749 line:15% 
as a Native American,

197
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:12.448 line:15% 
to proudly display my heritage

198
00:08:12.448 --> 00:08:15.189 line:15% 
in the Monterey Bay area, in the metropolitan area,

199
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:17.951 line:15% 
my father, that was his first step

200
00:08:17.951 --> 00:08:22.532 line:15% 
to be able to start bringing cultural awareness to society,

201
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.058 line:15% 
Native American cultural awareness to society.

202
00:08:26.058 --> 00:08:30.777 line:15% 
That was kind of the initial momentum for my dad

203
00:08:30.942 --> 00:08:35.348 line:15% 
to actually begin to create Native American clubs

204
00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:39.187 line:15% 
of Native Americans joining together within the society,

205
00:08:39.187 --> 00:08:40.446 line:15% 
dominant society,

206
00:08:40.446 --> 00:08:43.774 line:15% 
and for us to have a place to feel at home,

207
00:08:43.774 --> 00:08:44.958 line:15% 
and to feel accepted

208
00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.110 line:15% 
and to teach each other.

209
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.637 line:15% 
My dad was very much, from that point on,

210
00:08:48.637 --> 00:08:52.488 line:15% 
into sharing cultural awareness with the communities

211
00:08:52.488 --> 00:08:54.407 line:15% 
that we were in.

212
00:08:54.407 --> 00:08:57.170 line:15% 
He was teaching us Native American songs,

213
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.888 line:15% 
Native American dancing,

214
00:08:58.888 --> 00:09:00.359 line:15% 
we danced as a family,

215
00:09:00.359 --> 00:09:03.911 line:15% 
as a family dance troop, we were the Redhouse Family Dancers,

216
00:09:03.911 --> 00:09:05.799 line:15% 
we danced Native American dances,

217
00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:06.898 line:15% 
a variety of dances,

218
00:09:06.898 --> 00:09:09.234 line:15% 
we put on shows in schools, elementary schools,

219
00:09:09.234 --> 00:09:10.577 line:15% 
that we went to.

220
00:09:10.577 --> 00:09:15.069 line:15% 
We paraded along in rodeo parades.

221
00:09:16.969 --> 00:09:20.081 line:15% 
We did different functions for boy scout groups,

222
00:09:20.081 --> 00:09:22.235 line:15% 
to bring a cultural awareness to all

223
00:09:22.235 --> 00:09:23.473 line:15% 
these different organizations.

224
00:09:23.473 --> 00:09:26.711 line:15% 
<v Regina>How did this work for you in school?</v>

225
00:09:27.111 --> 00:09:29.051 line:15% 
Among your peers?

226
00:09:29.051 --> 00:09:32.720 line:15% 
<v ->It was kind of a melting pot</v>

227
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.499 line:15% 
in Monterey.

228
00:09:33.499 --> 00:09:37.274 line:15% 
Monterey was a place where we went to school with

229
00:09:37.274 --> 00:09:41.855 line:15% 
African Americans, Asian, Latinos, Filipinos,

230
00:09:45.687 --> 00:09:48.286 line:15% 
and we were pretty much the only Native Americans

231
00:09:48.286 --> 00:09:49.630 line:15% 
in the school.

232
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.742 line:15% 
<v Regina>But was it diverse enough that you still felt</v>

233
00:09:51.742 --> 00:09:53.587 line:15% 
safe, relatively safe,

234
00:09:53.587 --> 00:09:54.600 line:15% 
or were there

235
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.456 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah I think we felt okay about that.</v>

236
00:09:56.456 --> 00:09:58.195 line:15% 
It wasn't really, we didn't really feel

237
00:09:58.195 --> 00:09:59.517 line:15% 
that there was a difference

238
00:09:59.517 --> 00:10:00.797 line:15% 
because we were,

239
00:10:00.797 --> 00:10:03.517 line:15% 
I think probably because my mom was Filipino

240
00:10:03.517 --> 00:10:04.765 line:15% 
and my dad was Navajo,

241
00:10:04.765 --> 00:10:05.800 line:15% 
so we we're already kind of

242
00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.490 line:15% 
an interracial, universal mix there.

243
00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.498 line:15% 
So for us, we didn't look at different colors of people,

244
00:10:12.498 --> 00:10:16.608 line:15% 
we didn't really think of ourselves as different.

245
00:10:17.238 --> 00:10:20.699 line:15% 
I think other people, when we go into the schools,

246
00:10:20.699 --> 00:10:22.727 line:15% 
they would go

247
00:10:22.727 --> 00:10:24.209 line:15% 
(Tony ululates)

248
00:10:24.209 --> 00:10:25.756 line:15% 
You know, that,

249
00:10:25.756 --> 00:10:27.462 line:15% 
the Indian hooting,

250
00:10:27.462 --> 00:10:28.390 line:15% 
they would do that.

251
00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.267 line:15% 
That was something that was kind of like,

252
00:10:30.267 --> 00:10:32.848 line:15% 
it kind of put me off,

253
00:10:32.848 --> 00:10:35.834 line:15% 
because I didn't understand why they did that

254
00:10:35.834 --> 00:10:36.912 line:15% 
because we didn't do that.

255
00:10:36.912 --> 00:10:37.904 line:15% 
(Regina laughs)

256
00:10:37.904 --> 00:10:38.821 line:15% 
That wasn't something,

257
00:10:38.821 --> 00:10:39.483 line:15% 
we didn't go around

258
00:10:39.483 --> 00:10:40.667 line:15% 
<v Regina>That's something they saw in Hollywood movies.</v>

259
00:10:40.667 --> 00:10:41.136 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah,</v>

260
00:10:41.136 --> 00:10:42.917 line:15% 
that was something that was a stereotype.

261
00:10:42.917 --> 00:10:44.464 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yeah, so you dealt a little bit</v>

262
00:10:44.464 --> 00:10:45.402 line:15% 
with stereotyping.

263
00:10:45.402 --> 00:10:46.149 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah.</v>

264
00:10:46.149 --> 00:10:47.792 line:15% 
<v Regina>And it sounds like your father was</v>

265
00:10:47.792 --> 00:10:49.829 line:15% 
not going to have you shy away

266
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:52.634 line:15% 
from your experience as Native Americans,

267
00:10:52.634 --> 00:10:53.914 line:15% 
so buying into that,

268
00:10:53.914 --> 00:10:55.013 line:15% 
or having to cover up,

269
00:10:55.013 --> 00:10:57.647 line:15% 
it sounds like he was not suggesting

270
00:10:57.647 --> 00:10:58.703 line:15% 
to you and your brothers

271
00:10:58.703 --> 00:11:00.495 line:15% 
that you have to put on a three piece suit

272
00:11:00.495 --> 00:11:04.222 line:15% 
as he felt he had to do at one time, right?

273
00:11:04.612 --> 00:11:07.524 line:15% 
<v ->Well he</v>

274
00:11:07.524 --> 00:11:10.329 line:15% 
was raised on a reservation, Navajo reservation,

275
00:11:10.329 --> 00:11:13.401 line:15% 
at a young age they were taken away from their homes

276
00:11:13.401 --> 00:11:16.099 line:15% 
and put into boarding schools.

277
00:11:16.099 --> 00:11:20.078 line:15% 
My dad experienced that whole situation

278
00:11:20.078 --> 00:11:24.312 line:15% 
and it was very, very hurtful to them.

279
00:11:24.312 --> 00:11:26.605 line:15% 
They were told not to sing their songs,

280
00:11:26.605 --> 00:11:28.578 line:15% 
they were told not to speak their language,

281
00:11:28.578 --> 00:11:29.816 line:15% 
their hair was cut,

282
00:11:29.816 --> 00:11:33.143 line:15% 
they were made to dress in the type of clothing

283
00:11:33.143 --> 00:11:36.759 line:15% 
that Europeans would wear.

284
00:11:36.759 --> 00:11:37.873 line:15% 
So they were very much,

285
00:11:37.873 --> 00:11:40.177 line:15% 
it was a forced assimilation.

286
00:11:40.177 --> 00:11:43.569 line:15% 
They were taken away from their families, from their homes

287
00:11:43.569 --> 00:11:46.694 line:15% 
and all the things that they knew.

288
00:11:46.694 --> 00:11:49.926 line:15% 
So my dad suffered a lot from that

289
00:11:49.926 --> 00:11:52.774 line:15% 
and also when he went into the army,

290
00:11:52.774 --> 00:11:56.080 line:15% 
from herding sheep and going into the army,

291
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.171 line:15% 
it was quite change for him also.

292
00:11:58.171 --> 00:12:01.939 line:15% 
Because he received a lot of

293
00:12:02.009 --> 00:12:05.391 line:15% 
remarks and discrimination from other people

294
00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:08.709 line:15% 
because of his heritage as a Native American.

295
00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:11.332 line:15% 
In the civil service, he had a very difficult time

296
00:12:11.332 --> 00:12:14.394 line:15% 
because he was put in a place of authority,

297
00:12:14.394 --> 00:12:18.073 line:15% 
he was the first Native American to enroll in

298
00:12:18.073 --> 00:12:20.569 line:15% 
Santa Clara University after World War II,

299
00:12:20.569 --> 00:12:22.254 line:15% 
on a GI bill,

300
00:12:22.254 --> 00:12:25.572 line:15% 
and he graduated with a bachelors in accounting.

301
00:12:25.572 --> 00:12:29.347 line:15% 
He went back into civil service, back into the army,

302
00:12:29.347 --> 00:12:32.014 line:15% 
and he started to do work as an auditor

303
00:12:32.014 --> 00:12:33.314 line:15% 
for their army base.

304
00:12:33.314 --> 00:12:36.952 line:15% 
His peers didn't like it, they didn't like

305
00:12:36.952 --> 00:12:39.651 line:15% 
seeing a Native American,

306
00:12:39.651 --> 00:12:43.291 line:15% 
a red man, what they would call him,

307
00:12:43.311 --> 00:12:47.170 line:15% 
succeeding and wearing a suit and a tie

308
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.871 line:15% 
and a shirt, white shirt, that he kept very well pressed

309
00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:53.496 line:15% 
all the time, and shiny shoes

310
00:12:53.496 --> 00:12:55.304 line:15% 
<v Regina>Hard to stereotype under those conditions.</v>

311
00:12:55.304 --> 00:12:57.395 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah, but he excelled to the point</v>

312
00:12:57.395 --> 00:13:00.851 line:15% 
to where he became a supervising auditor

313
00:13:00.851 --> 00:13:03.325 line:15% 
and he received a lot of flack from people

314
00:13:03.325 --> 00:13:06.429 line:15% 
calling him red hot, red man,

315
00:13:06.429 --> 00:13:09.256 line:15% 
instead of Redhouse,

316
00:13:09.256 --> 00:13:11.229 line:15% 
everything but Redhouse.

317
00:13:11.229 --> 00:13:14.013 line:15% 
So he was experiencing discrimination

318
00:13:14.013 --> 00:13:18.055 line:15% 
as he was teaching us to bring cultural awareness to

319
00:13:18.055 --> 00:13:21.201 line:15% 
the dominant society that we were living in.

320
00:13:21.201 --> 00:13:24.700 line:15% 
He chose to raise us in this society

321
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.540 line:15% 
and he chose not to teach us the Navajo language

322
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.136 line:15% 
because he did not want us to become confused,

323
00:13:32.136 --> 00:13:35.217 line:15% 
he wanted us to become articulate in English

324
00:13:35.217 --> 00:13:36.923 line:15% 
he wanted us to excell

325
00:13:36.923 --> 00:13:38.918 line:15% 
and he wanted us to be able to compete

326
00:13:38.918 --> 00:13:40.870 line:15% 
with the white people.

327
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.458 line:15% 
<v Regina>Yes, and yet</v>

328
00:13:42.458 --> 00:13:43.973 line:15% 
at the same time,

329
00:13:43.973 --> 00:13:47.781 line:15% 
he was still having to prove himself day in and day out

330
00:13:47.781 --> 00:13:50.394 line:15% 
while he was encouraging you to

331
00:13:50.394 --> 00:13:53.285 line:15% 
now begin recovering your roots,

332
00:13:53.285 --> 00:13:56.453 line:15% 
maintaining your roots through the arts and so forth,

333
00:13:56.453 --> 00:13:58.180 line:15% 
and like you say, putting you right

334
00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.530 line:15% 
out in front with your ceremonial costume on.

335
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.210 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah.</v>

336
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.735 line:15% 
<v Regina>What happened to him in terms of,</v>

337
00:14:06.735 --> 00:14:07.940 line:15% 
everything we're talking about here,

338
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.945 line:15% 
as we started the conversation about this feeling

339
00:14:09.945 --> 00:14:11.577 line:15% 
of connectedness with all,

340
00:14:11.577 --> 00:14:14.233 line:15% 
do you know what happened to your father

341
00:14:14.233 --> 00:14:16.526 line:15% 
and his sense of that when he was taken away

342
00:14:16.526 --> 00:14:20.088 line:15% 
from what he considered his world, what was his world

343
00:14:20.088 --> 00:14:21.422 line:15% 
and being part of something

344
00:14:21.422 --> 00:14:25.432 line:15% 
and part of a philosophy that was connected to the all,

345
00:14:25.432 --> 00:14:27.885 line:15% 
what happened to him on a spiritual level

346
00:14:27.885 --> 00:14:30.733 line:15% 
after being removed from all of that?

347
00:14:30.733 --> 00:14:34.818 line:15% 
<v ->Well spiritually, if you trace</v>

348
00:14:34.818 --> 00:14:37.719 line:15% 
in my own opinion,

349
00:14:37.719 --> 00:14:40.866 line:15% 
tracing the history of the Redhouse family,

350
00:14:40.866 --> 00:14:44.204 line:15% 
looking at our evolution,

351
00:14:44.204 --> 00:14:46.764 line:15% 
when we would go back there as small children

352
00:14:46.764 --> 00:14:49.484 line:15% 
and visit from California and go up to the reservation

353
00:14:49.484 --> 00:14:50.636 line:15% 
in the summer time,

354
00:14:50.636 --> 00:14:52.331 line:15% 
there were lots of sheep,

355
00:14:52.331 --> 00:14:56.227 line:15% 
there were lots of horses,

356
00:14:56.497 --> 00:15:00.600 line:15% 
and they were continuing to prosper,

357
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.998 line:15% 
you could tell how prosperous a family was,

358
00:15:02.998 --> 00:15:04.192 line:15% 
how successful they were,

359
00:15:04.192 --> 00:15:05.579 line:15% 
by how many sheep they had.

360
00:15:05.579 --> 00:15:07.019 line:15% 
So they had a good number of sheep.

361
00:15:07.019 --> 00:15:09.877 line:15% 
But they had more before that,

362
00:15:09.877 --> 00:15:12.789 line:15% 
and they ended up having very few

363
00:15:12.789 --> 00:15:16.362 line:15% 
and down to nothing of anything eventually.

364
00:15:16.362 --> 00:15:19.263 line:15% 
What I see happening was that

365
00:15:19.263 --> 00:15:20.767 line:15% 
my grandfather,

366
00:15:20.767 --> 00:15:24.042 line:15% 
there was an article in Time magazine in the 1960s

367
00:15:24.042 --> 00:15:28.985 line:15% 
that my uncles, my grandfather's sons,

368
00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:31.433 line:15% 
my father's brothers,

369
00:15:31.433 --> 00:15:33.343 line:15% 
became evangelists.

370
00:15:33.343 --> 00:15:35.518 line:15% 
<v Regina>Evangelists?</v>
<v ->Christian evangelists.</v>

371
00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:38.889 line:15% 
There were missionaries that would come to the hogans,

372
00:15:38.889 --> 00:15:40.094 line:15% 
come to the houses,

373
00:15:40.094 --> 00:15:42.857 line:15% 
and would teach about Christianity.

374
00:15:42.857 --> 00:15:46.067 line:15% 
While my uncles became Christians,

375
00:15:46.067 --> 00:15:49.235 line:15% 
orthodox Christians, and evangelists,

376
00:15:49.235 --> 00:15:54.114 line:15% 
and one of the things that they succeeded in doing

377
00:15:55.634 --> 00:15:58.482 line:15% 
that was put in Time magazine, an article that

378
00:15:58.482 --> 00:15:59.741 line:15% 
was put in Time magazine,

379
00:15:59.741 --> 00:16:01.916 line:15% 
was that one of my uncles converted my grandfather,

380
00:16:01.916 --> 00:16:03.517 line:15% 
who was a medicine man,

381
00:16:03.517 --> 00:16:05.874 line:15% 
to Christianity

382
00:16:05.874 --> 00:16:08.071 line:15% 
and from that point on, my grandfather,

383
00:16:08.071 --> 00:16:12.683 line:15% 
he pretty much turned away from all of his medicine,

384
00:16:14.268 --> 00:16:16.231 line:15% 
all of his traditional medicine,

385
00:16:16.231 --> 00:16:17.638 line:15% 
his healing work,

386
00:16:17.638 --> 00:16:22.246 line:15% 
and he actually got rid of all of his healing paraphernalia,

387
00:16:24.056 --> 00:16:26.641 line:15% 
and from that point on,

388
00:16:26.641 --> 00:16:31.641 line:15% 
I see that there became a mixed perspective

389
00:16:33.115 --> 00:16:34.437 line:15% 
that happened in the family

390
00:16:34.437 --> 00:16:38.864 line:15% 
and I see that the family became weaker,

391
00:16:38.864 --> 00:16:40.634 line:15% 
I feel that it became weaker,

392
00:16:40.634 --> 00:16:43.013 line:15% 
I feel that there was a confusion

393
00:16:43.013 --> 00:16:45.209 line:15% 
because they still tried to hold on to some of the traditions

394
00:16:45.209 --> 00:16:47.140 line:15% 
but at the same time, they were very much

395
00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.273 line:15% 
trying to please another perspective

396
00:16:49.273 --> 00:16:51.769 line:15% 
that was brought into their community.

397
00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:54.371 line:15% 
To this day, there are no sheep

398
00:16:54.371 --> 00:16:55.993 line:15% 
there are no horses,

399
00:16:55.993 --> 00:17:00.285 line:15% 
the families have had a lot of personal problems,

400
00:17:00.931 --> 00:17:02.905 line:15% 
a lot of addiction problems,

401
00:17:02.905 --> 00:17:06.339 line:15% 
and I think that a lot of that was a result

402
00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:10.093 line:15% 
from losing that power that they had,

403
00:17:10.093 --> 00:17:12.781 line:15% 
the reference point, the foundation

404
00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:14.625 line:15% 
of the traditional ways

405
00:17:14.625 --> 00:17:18.402 line:15% 
and I can look back and kind of trace it,

406
00:17:18.402 --> 00:17:19.543 line:15% 
looking at that.

407
00:17:19.543 --> 00:17:20.482 line:15% 
The history.

408
00:17:20.482 --> 00:17:22.487 line:15% 
<v Regina>And this is not an uncommon story</v>

409
00:17:22.487 --> 00:17:23.874 line:15% 
among Native American families,

410
00:17:23.874 --> 00:17:27.137 line:15% 
where these big conflicts in perspective,

411
00:17:27.137 --> 00:17:28.887 line:15% 
some of them enforced upon the family,

412
00:17:28.887 --> 00:17:31.649 line:15% 
some reluctantly embraced,

413
00:17:31.649 --> 00:17:33.846 line:15% 
some embraced, some reluctantly taken on,

414
00:17:33.846 --> 00:17:35.978 line:15% 
created this rift of sorts,

415
00:17:35.978 --> 00:17:37.707 line:15% 
as you say it created problems

416
00:17:37.707 --> 00:17:40.246 line:15% 
some really deep, spiritual, internal issues.

417
00:17:40.246 --> 00:17:43.559 line:15% 
And this is really now coming back into time now

418
00:17:43.559 --> 00:17:45.254 line:15% 
with you as an adult.

419
00:17:45.254 --> 00:17:47.643 line:15% 
It sounds like you picked up some of your grandfather's

420
00:17:47.643 --> 00:17:49.659 line:15% 
knowledge in the ways of healing.

421
00:17:49.659 --> 00:17:51.888 line:15% 
Is that fair to say?

422
00:17:51.888 --> 00:17:54.512 line:15% 
<v ->Well I believe it's something in the blood.</v>

423
00:17:54.512 --> 00:17:57.062 line:15% 
It's in the blood.

424
00:17:57.102 --> 00:18:00.386 line:15% 
Not just that, but it's also a decision that we make.

425
00:18:00.386 --> 00:18:01.826 line:15% 
It's a decision that we make

426
00:18:01.826 --> 00:18:06.182 line:15% 
that we want to be open

427
00:18:06.192 --> 00:18:08.672 line:15% 
and be available to receive information and wisdom

428
00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:10.773 line:15% 
from the spiritual realm

429
00:18:10.773 --> 00:18:15.226 line:15% 
and for it to flow through us if it's our intention to help people.

430
00:18:16.213 --> 00:18:18.122 line:15% 
To make this world a little bit better,

431
00:18:18.122 --> 00:18:20.415 line:15% 
even if it's one soul at a time.

432
00:18:20.415 --> 00:18:22.794 line:15% 
The desire to see people healed,

433
00:18:22.794 --> 00:18:24.788 line:15% 
the desire to see people recover,

434
00:18:24.788 --> 00:18:26.698 line:15% 
the desire to see people find hope

435
00:18:26.698 --> 00:18:30.088 line:15% 
when it's hopeless,

436
00:18:30.088 --> 00:18:32.681 line:15% 
when we open ourself up to that,

437
00:18:32.681 --> 00:18:35.497 line:15% 
we will receive the information that we need

438
00:18:35.497 --> 00:18:38.451 line:15% 
intuitively, once again,

439
00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:41.353 line:15% 
I believe that everything in the universe

440
00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:42.590 line:15% 
is part of me,

441
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:47.338 line:15% 
I believe that every sound, every principle,

442
00:18:47.763 --> 00:18:51.688 line:15% 
every spiritual tradition, every belief system

443
00:18:51.688 --> 00:18:56.161 line:15% 
every invention, every composition,

444
00:18:57.458 --> 00:18:59.944 line:15% 
everything is in the air.

445
00:18:59.944 --> 00:19:03.175 line:15% 
I'm very much in tune with the ability

446
00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:06.620 line:15% 
to take things that are waiting for me in the air,

447
00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.530 line:15% 
in the atmosphere,

448
00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.610 line:15% 
that are resonating in the atmosphere,

449
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.351 line:15% 
that have been there for ages,

450
00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:16.054 line:15% 
and to be able to grab hold of those things

451
00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:18.715 line:15% 
when I need something for a specific purpose.

452
00:19:18.715 --> 00:19:21.276 line:15% 
It's like walking through an apple orchard.

453
00:19:21.276 --> 00:19:24.241 line:15% 
If I get hungry and I want an apple,

454
00:19:24.241 --> 00:19:27.025 line:15% 
I will just grab an apple, you know

455
00:19:27.025 --> 00:19:28.443 line:15% 
(Tony pops his lips apart)

456
00:19:28.443 --> 00:19:31.430 line:15% 
pull that apple and I will eat it, okay?

457
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.179 line:15% 
The same thing in life.

458
00:19:33.179 --> 00:19:36.753 line:15% 
If I am going to present an event,

459
00:19:36.753 --> 00:19:39.514 line:15% 
every Tuesday night I work with women addicts

460
00:19:39.514 --> 00:19:40.250 line:15% 
here in Tuscon,

461
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.914 line:15% 
meth, heroin, cocaine addicts.

462
00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:45.103 line:15% 
If I'm on my way to work with these women for three hours,

463
00:19:45.103 --> 00:19:49.700 line:15% 
then on the way, if I am looking for some direction,

464
00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.207 line:15% 
I will simply think about,

465
00:19:52.207 --> 00:19:55.673 line:15% 
okay all I need to do is reach up and there is everything

466
00:19:55.673 --> 00:19:56.901 line:15% 
that I need,

467
00:19:56.901 --> 00:19:59.940 line:15% 
everything that I will want to share with

468
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:00.921 line:15% 
these people,

469
00:20:00.921 --> 00:20:02.585 line:15% 
it is available for me.

470
00:20:02.585 --> 00:20:04.744 line:15% 
<v Regina>Let's talk about how that shows itself</v>

471
00:20:04.744 --> 00:20:07.065 line:15% 
in some of the examples of what you've experienced

472
00:20:07.065 --> 00:20:08.014 line:15% 
with, say, this group of women.

473
00:20:08.014 --> 00:20:08.631 line:15% 
<v ->Okay,</v>

474
00:20:08.631 --> 00:20:12.792 line:15% 
I believe that the ability

475
00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:17.136 line:15% 
to receive

476
00:20:17.136 --> 00:20:19.652 line:15% 
unconditional love

477
00:20:19.652 --> 00:20:23.429 line:15% 
and the ability to give it, to share it

478
00:20:23.429 --> 00:20:26.148 line:15% 
is the whole purpose that I'm here.

479
00:20:26.148 --> 00:20:28.026 line:15% 
That we are here on this earth.

480
00:20:28.026 --> 00:20:29.807 line:15% 
We're here to learn a lesson,

481
00:20:29.807 --> 00:20:32.921 line:15% 
it's the ability for me to be able to receive love

482
00:20:32.921 --> 00:20:34.671 line:15% 
and the ability to give love.

483
00:20:34.671 --> 00:20:36.495 line:15% 
That's all it is.

484
00:20:36.495 --> 00:20:40.430 line:15% 
I learned this lesson as I encounter people

485
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.161 line:15% 
as I've been through divorces

486
00:20:43.161 --> 00:20:45.614 line:15% 
as I've been through years of addiction,

487
00:20:45.614 --> 00:20:47.320 line:15% 
to alcohol and drugs,

488
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.371 line:15% 
all of these were teaching experiences for me

489
00:20:50.371 --> 00:20:51.736 line:15% 
along my path.

490
00:20:51.736 --> 00:20:54.403 line:15% 
I learned deeply about myself,

491
00:20:54.403 --> 00:20:55.757 line:15% 
how I reacted to people,

492
00:20:55.757 --> 00:20:57.283 line:15% 
how I reacted to situations,

493
00:20:57.283 --> 00:20:59.074 line:15% 
what came out of me,

494
00:20:59.074 --> 00:21:00.781 line:15% 
how I responded.

495
00:21:00.781 --> 00:21:02.669 line:15% 
I learned about me through all these situations,

496
00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:05.069 line:15% 
none of them were negative,

497
00:21:05.069 --> 00:21:07.746 line:15% 
this was all positive things.

498
00:21:07.746 --> 00:21:10.551 line:15% 
In the process of learning these things

499
00:21:10.551 --> 00:21:14.839 line:15% 
I was able to open myself to receive healing,

500
00:21:14.839 --> 00:21:18.008 line:15% 
to open myself up to receive love from the spirit.

501
00:21:18.008 --> 00:21:19.553 line:15% 
And then, in the process,

502
00:21:19.553 --> 00:21:21.932 line:15% 
I'm also able to start to learn to share

503
00:21:21.932 --> 00:21:24.724 line:15% 
and to give of myself to people.

504
00:21:24.724 --> 00:21:26.753 line:15% 
That's why I'm here on this earth.

505
00:21:26.753 --> 00:21:28.385 line:15% 
<v Regina>And this is particularly</v>

506
00:21:28.385 --> 00:21:32.267 line:15% 
critical when you're dealing with people who feel

507
00:21:32.267 --> 00:21:35.274 line:15% 
very unlovable at that time in their lives.

508
00:21:35.274 --> 00:21:36.267 line:15% 
<v ->Right, right</v>

509
00:21:36.267 --> 00:21:37.643 line:15% 
and when working with these women,

510
00:21:37.643 --> 00:21:38.890 line:15% 
I'll give you an example,

511
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:40.288 line:15% 
a couple weeks ago,

512
00:21:40.288 --> 00:21:43.766 line:15% 
I have the women, the new women that come in,

513
00:21:43.766 --> 00:21:46.581 line:15% 
I teach them Native American crafts,

514
00:21:46.581 --> 00:21:49.745 line:15% 
the whole class, I usually work with 15 or 20 women at a time

515
00:21:49.745 --> 00:21:53.344 line:15% 
and I have them learning Native American crafts,

516
00:21:53.344 --> 00:21:55.435 line:15% 
I teach them to make artifacts with their hands,

517
00:21:55.435 --> 00:21:57.536 line:15% 
dream catchers, different things,

518
00:21:57.536 --> 00:22:00.554 line:15% 
and I teach them about spiritual symbolism,

519
00:22:00.554 --> 00:22:02.666 line:15% 
the use of healing for these things

520
00:22:02.666 --> 00:22:05.215 line:15% 
and how they can apply it to their own lives

521
00:22:05.215 --> 00:22:07.135 line:15% 
and their recovery from addiction

522
00:22:07.135 --> 00:22:10.090 line:15% 
and put their own hopes into that,

523
00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:10.975 line:15% 
into their own projects,

524
00:22:10.975 --> 00:22:11.913 line:15% 
their own colors,

525
00:22:11.913 --> 00:22:14.228 line:15% 
once again, their own uniqueness,

526
00:22:14.228 --> 00:22:16.628 line:15% 
right into what they're creating with their hands.

527
00:22:16.628 --> 00:22:18.313 line:15% 
Just like bead work or anything else,

528
00:22:18.313 --> 00:22:19.817 line:15% 
but these women are from all different races.

529
00:22:19.817 --> 00:22:21.385 line:15% 
So they're creating these things

530
00:22:21.385 --> 00:22:23.049 line:15% 
and during these classes,

531
00:22:23.049 --> 00:22:24.873 line:15% 
I will take three women that are new

532
00:22:24.873 --> 00:22:28.392 line:15% 
and I will create a mask of their face.

533
00:22:28.392 --> 00:22:30.386 line:15% 
A plaster mask of their face

534
00:22:30.386 --> 00:22:32.254 line:15% 
and I will ask them,

535
00:22:32.254 --> 00:22:33.608 line:15% 
whoever wants to volunteer,

536
00:22:33.608 --> 00:22:36.339 line:15% 
will be able to lay down,

537
00:22:36.339 --> 00:22:38.077 line:15% 
to be vulnerable,

538
00:22:38.077 --> 00:22:40.136 line:15% 
to trust me,

539
00:22:40.136 --> 00:22:43.528 line:15% 
to close their eyes and to allow me

540
00:22:43.528 --> 00:22:45.886 line:15% 
to make a mask of their face.

541
00:22:45.886 --> 00:22:49.767 line:15% 
For women from addictions, from a history of addiction,

542
00:22:49.767 --> 00:22:53.927 line:15% 
you will not usually find yourself laying down

543
00:22:53.927 --> 00:22:56.689 line:15% 
on your back, vulnerable, with your eyes closed

544
00:22:56.689 --> 00:22:59.697 line:15% 
in a situation when you're around addicts

545
00:22:59.697 --> 00:23:02.055 line:15% 
and around dangerous situations, that you don't know

546
00:23:02.055 --> 00:23:03.440 line:15% 
what's gonna happen to you.

547
00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.895 line:15% 
And many times things happen invariably

548
00:23:05.895 --> 00:23:06.833 line:15% 
<v Regina>And you're a man</v>

549
00:23:06.833 --> 00:23:08.390 line:15% 
<v ->for people in our addictions.</v>

550
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:09.777 line:15% 
And I tell them, also,

551
00:23:09.777 --> 00:23:12.006 line:15% 
this is going to be a healing process

552
00:23:12.006 --> 00:23:13.616 line:15% 
because I'm gonna be a man,

553
00:23:13.616 --> 00:23:15.568 line:15% 
you're gonna be allowing a man, me,

554
00:23:15.568 --> 00:23:18.651 line:15% 
to touch your face in an appropriate way

555
00:23:18.651 --> 00:23:20.581 line:15% 
it's gonna feel good to you,

556
00:23:20.581 --> 00:23:22.416 line:15% 
it's gonna be something that you're gonna,

557
00:23:22.416 --> 00:23:26.757 line:15% 
it's gonna bring up experiences and sensations for you.

558
00:23:26.757 --> 00:23:29.946 line:15% 
But you're gonna learn that there is an appropriate way

559
00:23:29.946 --> 00:23:33.868 line:15% 
and in a new life and a new path,

560
00:23:34.458 --> 00:23:36.356 line:15% 
free from addiction,

561
00:23:36.356 --> 00:23:37.754 line:15% 
that you're gonna be able to experience

562
00:23:37.754 --> 00:23:39.141 line:15% 
good things.

563
00:23:39.141 --> 00:23:41.593 line:15% 
You're gonna be able to be touched in an appropriate way,

564
00:23:41.593 --> 00:23:45.188 line:15% 
and nothing destructive is gonna result in it.

565
00:23:45.188 --> 00:23:46.958 line:15% 
<v Regina>What have you seen by way of experience?</v>

566
00:23:46.958 --> 00:23:48.825 line:15% 
<v ->I ask them to write,</v>

567
00:23:48.825 --> 00:23:51.566 line:15% 
what I do is, I'm touching their face,

568
00:23:51.566 --> 00:23:55.875 line:15% 
and I'm speaking to them as i'm doing this,

569
00:23:57.395 --> 00:23:59.576 line:15% 
in my own life, when I was a little boy,

570
00:23:59.576 --> 00:24:01.123 line:15% 
my mother used to take Vaseline

571
00:24:01.123 --> 00:24:02.765 line:15% 
and put Vaseline on my face,

572
00:24:02.765 --> 00:24:04.600 line:15% 
because I had dry skin.

573
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.682 line:15% 
That was one of the most memorable, pleasurable

574
00:24:07.682 --> 00:24:10.263 line:15% 
experiences I remember as a child, okay.

575
00:24:10.263 --> 00:24:12.130 line:15% 
That stuck with me.

576
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:13.805 line:15% 
These things that happen to us as children

577
00:24:13.805 --> 00:24:15.042 line:15% 
are foundational,

578
00:24:15.042 --> 00:24:18.663 line:15% 
these imprints on us, that we experience as children,

579
00:24:18.663 --> 00:24:20.652 line:15% 
are sent to us for a reason.

580
00:24:20.652 --> 00:24:23.596 line:15% 
Because that's one of the things that helped me

581
00:24:23.596 --> 00:24:25.249 line:15% 
now I'm able to touch these women

582
00:24:25.249 --> 00:24:27.564 line:15% 
and know that it's gonna feel good for them,

583
00:24:27.564 --> 00:24:29.249 line:15% 
that it's gonna be comforting,

584
00:24:29.249 --> 00:24:33.248 line:15% 
but it's also gonna be bringing up

585
00:24:33.248 --> 00:24:35.990 line:15% 
things to the surface that want to be healed.

586
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:40.629 line:15% 
And I have them write a page immediately after I'm done

587
00:24:40.629 --> 00:24:42.315 line:15% 
making the mask.

588
00:24:42.315 --> 00:24:45.098 line:15% 
They go wash up and I have them write a page

589
00:24:45.098 --> 00:24:47.190 line:15% 
about what they experienced,

590
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:50.293 line:15% 
what they were feeling as the mask was being made.

591
00:24:50.293 --> 00:24:54.293 line:15% 
And this last time I was there,

592
00:24:54.293 --> 00:24:55.882 line:15% 
I had three women,

593
00:24:55.882 --> 00:24:58.036 line:15% 
two of the women came back

594
00:24:58.036 --> 00:25:00.042 line:15% 
and they immediately gave me a page

595
00:25:00.042 --> 00:25:02.687 line:15% 
and they wrote what they felt and what they experienced

596
00:25:02.687 --> 00:25:04.105 line:15% 
as the mask was being made.

597
00:25:04.105 --> 00:25:07.081 line:15% 
The third person did not bring back a piece of paper.

598
00:25:07.081 --> 00:25:10.004 line:15% 
Later on when the class was over,

599
00:25:10.004 --> 00:25:13.865 line:15% 
I asked her how her experience was.

600
00:25:13.865 --> 00:25:17.075 line:15% 
And she said that it was very difficult for her.

601
00:25:17.075 --> 00:25:19.934 line:15% 
And yes, she did volunteer to do it.

602
00:25:19.934 --> 00:25:21.768 line:15% 
It was very difficult for her

603
00:25:21.768 --> 00:25:25.545 line:15% 
and that three months ago,

604
00:25:25.545 --> 00:25:28.243 line:15% 
three months, just three months ago,

605
00:25:28.243 --> 00:25:30.376 line:15% 
that she was kidnapped at gunpoint,

606
00:25:30.376 --> 00:25:32.028 line:15% 
she was tied up,

607
00:25:32.028 --> 00:25:34.504 line:15% 
duct tape was put over her mouth

608
00:25:34.504 --> 00:25:39.314 line:15% 
and it brought up those memories for her.

609
00:25:39.314 --> 00:25:42.450 line:15% 
So it was something very close to her.

610
00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.925 line:15% 
Something that had just recently happened,

611
00:25:44.925 --> 00:25:46.940 line:15% 
something that was dangerous,

612
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.296 line:15% 
something that was harmful,

613
00:25:48.296 --> 00:25:50.493 line:15% 
something that was unpleasant,

614
00:25:50.493 --> 00:25:52.156 line:15% 
an unpleasant experience for her,

615
00:25:52.156 --> 00:25:55.953 line:15% 
but she was willing to become open,

616
00:25:55.953 --> 00:25:59.110 line:15% 
her act of being willing to experience something

617
00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:01.466 line:15% 
that would be close to something that

618
00:26:01.466 --> 00:26:03.110 line:15% 
was very hurtful to her

619
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.881 line:15% 
and to relive that,

620
00:26:04.881 --> 00:26:07.984 line:15% 
to be open to the spirit and to receive love and healing,

621
00:26:07.984 --> 00:26:11.131 line:15% 
that was a major step of courage for her.

622
00:26:11.131 --> 00:26:13.264 line:15% 
<v Regina>That's a catalyst to change, right there.</v>

623
00:26:13.264 --> 00:26:14.522 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah, that's a major step.</v>

624
00:26:14.522 --> 00:26:19.446 line:15% 
And whenever we do that, and will face the dark places

625
00:26:21.177 --> 00:26:23.588 line:15% 
and the places that we want to avoid

626
00:26:23.588 --> 00:26:25.679 line:15% 
and learn to embrace those things,

627
00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:27.802 line:15% 
then we will receive healing.

628
00:26:27.802 --> 00:26:29.156 line:15% 
<v Regina>Let's talk about some of the other</v>

629
00:26:29.156 --> 00:26:30.340 line:15% 
work you do as well,

630
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.569 line:15% 
because you also bring music and drumming and such

631
00:26:32.569 --> 00:26:34.340 line:15% 
into your work and this is something,

632
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.816 line:15% 
it's not just sort of a primal instinctive thing.

633
00:26:37.816 --> 00:26:40.963 line:15% 
There's something that happens within our being,

634
00:26:40.963 --> 00:26:45.006 line:15% 
within our entire mind, not just the gray matter,

635
00:26:45.006 --> 00:26:47.256 line:15% 
with drumming.

636
00:26:47.256 --> 00:26:49.453 line:15% 
Specifically with drumming.

637
00:26:49.453 --> 00:26:54.413 line:15% 
It has a quality of opening us into much deeper levels

638
00:26:54.413 --> 00:26:55.608 line:15% 
of ourselves.

639
00:26:55.608 --> 00:26:57.239 line:15% 
Can you talk about your experience

640
00:26:57.239 --> 00:27:00.631 line:15% 
in using ceremony and drumming in some of the healing work

641
00:27:00.631 --> 00:27:02.114 line:15% 
you're doing as well?

642
00:27:02.114 --> 00:27:03.469 line:15% 
And some of the experiences people

643
00:27:03.469 --> 00:27:06.707 line:15% 
have reported back to you?

644
00:27:07.707 --> 00:27:11.991 line:15% 
<v ->In my work, I use the three ancient forms of expression,</v>

645
00:27:11.991 --> 00:27:16.991 line:15% 
in indigenous cultures, Native American cultures,

646
00:27:17.718 --> 00:27:19.553 line:15% 
the oldest forms of expression

647
00:27:19.553 --> 00:27:22.368 line:15% 
are the voice, the drum, and the flute.

648
00:27:22.368 --> 00:27:26.496 line:15% 
You'll find those in Africa, Asia, all across the country,

649
00:27:26.496 --> 00:27:27.552 line:15% 
India

650
00:27:27.552 --> 00:27:29.164 line:15% 
<v Regina>South America</v>

651
00:27:29.164 --> 00:27:31.328 line:15% 
<v ->the middle east, South America, Native American,</v>

652
00:27:31.328 --> 00:27:33.653 line:15% 
those were the primary ways that we

653
00:27:33.653 --> 00:27:36.128 line:15% 
would express what was going on in our soul,

654
00:27:36.128 --> 00:27:38.058 line:15% 
what we wanted to see,

655
00:27:38.058 --> 00:27:39.722 line:15% 
what we were hoping for,

656
00:27:39.722 --> 00:27:41.025 line:15% 
what we were praying for,

657
00:27:41.025 --> 00:27:43.338 line:15% 
and also these were the tools that we used

658
00:27:43.338 --> 00:27:46.047 line:15% 
to enter into the spiritual realm

659
00:27:46.047 --> 00:27:47.711 line:15% 
that connected us with the spirit.

660
00:27:47.711 --> 00:27:51.380 line:15% 
The drum is what I use when I do

661
00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:55.487 line:15% 
private Native American healing meditation sessions.

662
00:27:55.487 --> 00:27:59.977 line:15% 
I do that at some of the different resorts

663
00:27:59.977 --> 00:28:03.070 line:15% 
and also I do that one to one with people.

664
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:06.762 line:15% 
And it's very much of a spiritual offering.

665
00:28:06.762 --> 00:28:10.120 line:15% 
And what I do is I use that drum

666
00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.371 line:15% 
and I use the heartbeat,

667
00:28:12.371 --> 00:28:14.483 line:15% 
the heartbeat of the drum

668
00:28:14.483 --> 00:28:15.892 line:15% 
and I make my own drums,

669
00:28:15.892 --> 00:28:18.878 line:15% 
I stretch my own skins, I make them on a full moon

670
00:28:18.878 --> 00:28:20.989 line:15% 
and I use specific animals

671
00:28:20.989 --> 00:28:24.445 line:15% 
to have their voice come out of those drums.

672
00:28:24.445 --> 00:28:26.941 line:15% 
But I use the heartbeat

673
00:28:26.941 --> 00:28:31.676 line:15% 
and the heartbeat goes back to our very beginning.

674
00:28:31.676 --> 00:28:34.471 line:15% 
It is the very first encounter that we have

675
00:28:34.471 --> 00:28:35.921 line:15% 
on this plane.

676
00:28:35.921 --> 00:28:37.073 line:15% 
Within the womb,

677
00:28:37.073 --> 00:28:39.132 line:15% 
that is what surrounded us,

678
00:28:39.132 --> 00:28:40.508 line:15% 
that's the vibration,

679
00:28:40.508 --> 00:28:42.662 line:15% 
that's what nourished us,

680
00:28:42.662 --> 00:28:44.326 line:15% 
that's what flowed through us,

681
00:28:44.326 --> 00:28:47.558 line:15% 
that's what we heard, that's what we felt.

682
00:28:47.558 --> 00:28:51.782 line:15% 
That was our place of beginning.

683
00:28:51.782 --> 00:28:54.512 line:15% 
That was a familiar, comforting,

684
00:28:54.512 --> 00:28:57.295 line:15% 
reassuring place for us.

685
00:28:57.295 --> 00:29:00.293 line:15% 
And so when I use that heartbeat,

686
00:29:00.293 --> 00:29:03.546 line:15% 
I take people back to that place.

687
00:29:03.546 --> 00:29:06.554 line:15% 
In a spiritual way, once again,

688
00:29:06.554 --> 00:29:09.679 line:15% 
we have access to every realm.

689
00:29:09.679 --> 00:29:11.717 line:15% 
With the heartbeat of the drum,

690
00:29:11.717 --> 00:29:13.915 line:15% 
I take people back to the very beginning.

691
00:29:13.915 --> 00:29:16.932 line:15% 
To the place that is very familiar to them,

692
00:29:16.932 --> 00:29:19.535 line:15% 
to a place that is comforting,

693
00:29:19.535 --> 00:29:22.255 line:15% 
to their foundation,

694
00:29:22.255 --> 00:29:23.353 line:15% 
to the reference point.

695
00:29:23.353 --> 00:29:26.307 line:15% 
The heartbeat takes us back to the womb

696
00:29:26.307 --> 00:29:30.745 line:15% 
and that is a place where it is simple

697
00:29:31.525 --> 00:29:35.436 line:15% 
and all of the things that we have experienced

698
00:29:35.436 --> 00:29:38.444 line:15% 
that we have complicated our life with

699
00:29:38.444 --> 00:29:42.081 line:15% 
that have detracted from us, that have taken our energy away

700
00:29:42.081 --> 00:29:45.600 line:15% 
the relationships, the encounters, all of those things

701
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.628 line:15% 
did not happen back then.

702
00:29:47.628 --> 00:29:49.655 line:15% 
When we were in the womb,

703
00:29:49.655 --> 00:29:53.078 line:15% 
floating around freely as a seed of life,

704
00:29:53.078 --> 00:29:57.143 line:15% 
we were content, we were at peace,

705
00:29:57.143 --> 00:29:59.360 line:15% 
we were nourished,

706
00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.290 line:15% 
we felt safe,

707
00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:05.813 line:15% 
and all of the DNA and all of the blueprint

708
00:30:05.813 --> 00:30:07.808 line:15% 
for our entire life,

709
00:30:07.808 --> 00:30:10.487 line:15% 
the plan for our true destiny,

710
00:30:10.487 --> 00:30:15.416 line:15% 
was right contained inside of that little seed of life.

711
00:30:15.539 --> 00:30:16.414 line:15% 
It's always been there.

712
00:30:16.414 --> 00:30:18.292 line:15% 
<v Regina>It's almost like rewinding the hands of time</v>

713
00:30:18.292 --> 00:30:19.529 line:15% 
<v ->I'm rewinding it because</v>

714
00:30:19.529 --> 00:30:23.508 line:15% 
if we have access to every realm in time and space,

715
00:30:23.508 --> 00:30:27.327 line:15% 
because we are one with everything,

716
00:30:27.327 --> 00:30:30.196 line:15% 
then when we enter into the spiritual realm,

717
00:30:30.196 --> 00:30:33.448 line:15% 
and we open the door to the spiritual world,

718
00:30:33.448 --> 00:30:36.798 line:15% 
we can step into any world that we want to.

719
00:30:36.798 --> 00:30:39.491 line:15% 
So I am doing that, I am taking people back

720
00:30:39.491 --> 00:30:40.889 line:15% 
to their very beginning

721
00:30:40.889 --> 00:30:44.799 line:15% 
because many times our beginning was not ideal.

722
00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:47.508 line:15% 
Sometimes we were conceived in distress,

723
00:30:47.508 --> 00:30:49.502 line:15% 
sometimes we were conceived unexpectedly,

724
00:30:49.502 --> 00:30:53.396 line:15% 
sometimes we were conceived through rape.

725
00:30:53.396 --> 00:30:56.425 line:15% 
So what are we gonna do, you know?

726
00:30:56.425 --> 00:30:59.614 line:15% 
We go back and we have the ability

727
00:30:59.614 --> 00:31:04.392 line:15% 
to recreate any time, any situation in our life,

728
00:31:04.392 --> 00:31:06.056 line:15% 
so we can re-lay that foundation

729
00:31:06.056 --> 00:31:08.979 line:15% 
instead of just being the heartbeat of the mother,

730
00:31:08.979 --> 00:31:12.370 line:15% 
of the mother, the human mother,

731
00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:16.541 line:15% 
this heartbeat is going to be the pulse of the spirit

732
00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:20.253 line:15% 
which is unconditional, perfect love.

733
00:31:20.253 --> 00:31:23.143 line:15% 
That is what I'm surrounding them with,

734
00:31:23.143 --> 00:31:24.668 line:15% 
that's what I'm guiding them with

735
00:31:24.668 --> 00:31:26.940 line:15% 
is the unconditional love of the spirit

736
00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:30.983 line:15% 
which is no expectations, no agenda

737
00:31:30.983 --> 00:31:34.928 line:15% 
no right or wrong, no good or bad,

738
00:31:34.928 --> 00:31:37.990 line:15% 
no comparisons, no ego,

739
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:42.480 line:15% 
no judgement, no fear.

740
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:46.128 line:15% 
<v Regina>And this includes dealing with people</v>

741
00:31:46.128 --> 00:31:49.594 line:15% 
with really frightening, life threatening diseases, even.

742
00:31:49.594 --> 00:31:52.176 line:15% 
You're taking people of all kinds,

743
00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:54.393 line:15% 
with all sorts of problems,

744
00:31:54.393 --> 00:31:56.016 line:15% 
back into this space.

745
00:31:56.016 --> 00:32:00.122 line:15% 
And do you see the healing begin there?

746
00:32:00.122 --> 00:32:03.781 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, I have worked with people</v>

747
00:32:03.781 --> 00:32:08.167 line:15% 
that are in the process of chemotherapy,

748
00:32:08.677 --> 00:32:11.770 line:15% 
radiation therapy, breast cancer patients

749
00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.575 line:15% 
and people that have, I have worked with them

750
00:32:14.575 --> 00:32:19.475 line:15% 
and it is a place where they're able to reverse

751
00:32:20.845 --> 00:32:25.658 line:15% 
they're able to go back before all of this started.

752
00:32:25.788 --> 00:32:30.572 line:15% 
And even if it is something that they are believing

753
00:32:30.872 --> 00:32:33.308 line:15% 
in their mind,

754
00:32:33.308 --> 00:32:35.975 line:15% 
that alone has the power to change

755
00:32:35.975 --> 00:32:39.186 line:15% 
the chemistry and everything in their life.

756
00:32:39.186 --> 00:32:40.283 line:15% 
<v Regina>Do you see this sometimes,</v>

757
00:32:40.283 --> 00:32:42.044 line:15% 
that people's body will start responding?

758
00:32:42.044 --> 00:32:45.809 line:15% 
<v ->I have seen it,</v>

759
00:32:45.809 --> 00:32:48.646 line:15% 
so far I've done it in conjunction with

760
00:32:48.646 --> 00:32:50.555 line:15% 
somebody going through therapy.

761
00:32:50.555 --> 00:32:52.859 line:15% 
And they came out clear.

762
00:32:52.859 --> 00:32:54.150 line:15% 
<v Regina>Fabulous.</v>

763
00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:58.166 line:15% 
<v ->They came out clear, and they're doing well today.</v>

764
00:32:59.306 --> 00:33:00.806 line:15% 
<v Regina>Mind, body, spirit connection.</v>

765
00:33:00.806 --> 00:33:03.429 line:15% 
Absolutely.

766
00:33:03.429 --> 00:33:05.723 line:15% 
Just kind of in brief before we sign off here,

767
00:33:05.723 --> 00:33:08.400 line:15% 
what do you think is the potential of man kind

768
00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.120 line:15% 
at this point in terms of that mind, body, spirit connection

769
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.765 line:15% 
in healing our own lives?

770
00:33:13.765 --> 00:33:17.018 line:15% 
<v ->I feel like we're at a good place,</v>

771
00:33:17.018 --> 00:33:21.673 line:15% 
I feel that there is a separation happening,

772
00:33:22.607 --> 00:33:24.228 line:15% 
that I've seen happening,

773
00:33:24.228 --> 00:33:28.313 line:15% 
that I see people that are pioneers

774
00:33:28.313 --> 00:33:32.494 line:15% 
and that are opening up to the spiritual aspect

775
00:33:32.494 --> 00:33:34.937 line:15% 
and there are many people that I'm running across

776
00:33:34.937 --> 00:33:38.126 line:15% 
all the time now that are thinking the same way I'm thinking

777
00:33:38.126 --> 00:33:40.259 line:15% 
and seeing the connection between the spirit

778
00:33:40.259 --> 00:33:42.552 line:15% 
and the world, and science
<v Regina>And science,</v>

779
00:33:42.552 --> 00:33:44.141 line:15% 
the most advance scientific realms

780
00:33:44.141 --> 00:33:45.763 line:15% 
are coming back to where you already are.

781
00:33:45.763 --> 00:33:47.960 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, and so I'm seeing that</v>

782
00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.000 line:15% 
there's a gravitational pull

783
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.770 line:15% 
that is pulling people together,

784
00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:56.973 line:15% 
even the recent presidential nomination,

785
00:33:56.973 --> 00:33:58.850 line:15% 
all of these things are going in that direction,

786
00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:01.186 line:15% 
but there's also, in the other way,

787
00:34:01.186 --> 00:34:02.828 line:15% 
there is also becomming a strengthening

788
00:34:02.828 --> 00:34:04.641 line:15% 
of those that are rigid,

789
00:34:04.641 --> 00:34:07.009 line:15% 
and those are becoming strong too.

790
00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:07.767 line:15% 
<v Regina>Polarities</v>

791
00:34:07.767 --> 00:34:10.689 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah, so there's two ways that we're going now,</v>

792
00:34:10.689 --> 00:34:13.110 line:15% 
and what I'm saying, which is nice,

793
00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:16.705 line:15% 
because it's becoming very clear which way to go,

794
00:34:16.705 --> 00:34:18.273 line:15% 
which way you want to go,

795
00:34:18.273 --> 00:34:22.546 line:15% 
so in that way I'm seeing that there are

796
00:34:23.136 --> 00:34:25.610 line:15% 
the paths are becoming very clear,

797
00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:27.562 line:15% 
but I am seeing an undercurrent

798
00:34:27.562 --> 00:34:30.282 line:15% 
of people that are really opening up,

799
00:34:30.282 --> 00:34:31.562 line:15% 
the more that I go out,

800
00:34:31.562 --> 00:34:34.591 line:15% 
the more that I perform for public audiences,

801
00:34:34.591 --> 00:34:37.492 line:15% 
people are really seeking, a lot of people are.

802
00:34:37.492 --> 00:34:38.975 line:15% 
<v Regina>They are, yes, and you exude this</v>

803
00:34:38.975 --> 00:34:40.969 line:15% 
incredible energy when you're up there

804
00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:43.327 line:15% 
it really commands people's attention and respect.

805
00:34:43.327 --> 00:34:44.863 line:15% 
It's not a novelty act,

806
00:34:44.863 --> 00:34:47.710 line:15% 
you're bringing a powerful medicine to the people.

807
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:50.558 line:15% 
And, as I witnessed last night, to hundreds of people

808
00:34:50.558 --> 00:34:52.137 line:15% 
at a time.

809
00:34:52.137 --> 00:34:53.299 line:15% 
It's very beautiful.

810
00:34:53.299 --> 00:34:54.601 line:15% 
And I know you have to go,

811
00:34:54.601 --> 00:34:56.349 line:15% 
we have literally just a couple minutes,

812
00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:57.907 line:15% 
and I want to thank you so much, Tony,

813
00:34:57.907 --> 00:34:59.089 line:15% 
for your time and we're gonna put

814
00:34:59.089 --> 00:35:00.477 line:15%

<v Tony>The heartbeat is the pulse of life.</v>

819
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:27.411 line:15% 
It is the first experience we have

820
00:35:27.411 --> 00:35:29.395 line:15% 
in the womb.

821
00:35:29.395 --> 00:35:32.109 line:15% 
This is our beginning.

(Native American drum music)

824
00:36:28.133 --> 00:36:30.245 line:15% 
In the womb, we are surrounded by the comfort

825
00:36:30.245 --> 00:36:33.797 line:15% 
and the nourishment of the spirit's love.

826
00:36:37.587 --> 00:36:42.014 line:15% 
This is the foundation for our future path in life.

You are content to be,

838
00:40:01.538 --> 00:40:04.077 line:15% 
not to try to be,

839
00:40:04.077 --> 00:40:08.572 line:15% 
not to try to become,

840
00:40:08.876 --> 00:40:12.204 line:15% 
just to be.
