00:00:00.623 --> 00:00:03.063
<v ->As we begin to feel the squeeze of the times,</v>

2
00:00:03.063 --> 00:00:05.787
meaning the movement toward large scale change,

3
00:00:05.787 --> 00:00:07.782
many of us begin looking to the most basic needs

4
00:00:07.782 --> 00:00:11.262
of life for solutions, such as family and community.

5
00:00:11.262 --> 00:00:14.802
Richard Flyer has a jump up in that he has spent many years

6
00:00:14.802 --> 00:00:17.822
working in the arena of creating conscious community.

7
00:00:17.822 --> 00:00:20.982
His work has created templates with which other communities

8
00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:24.302
can begin to build solid relationships from within,

9
00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:28.312
relationships that will serve all during changing times.

10
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.205
<v Regina>Your journey began early.</v>

11
00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:43.405
You were in just your pubescent years really when

12
00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:45.326
you had come from a Jewish family,

13
00:00:45.326 --> 00:00:47.445
and you had a certain kind of a comfort in

14
00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:50.465
the life around you, but things started changing for you

15
00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:53.386
because you started having your own, as you say off camera,

16
00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.265
religious experiences.

17
00:00:55.265 --> 00:00:57.885
Would you tell us a little bit about what happened in

18
00:00:57.885 --> 00:01:00.526
the earliest part of your life that started forming

19
00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:04.866
what you were to become in terms of your real affinity

20
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.566
with creating community?

21
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.946
What were those first experiences?

22
00:01:07.946 --> 00:01:10.045
<v ->You know, when I was really young it was in</v>

23
00:01:10.045 --> 00:01:14.526
Washington, D.C., and you know, I was 12.

24
00:01:14.526 --> 00:01:18.946
And I didn't understand it at the time, it was much later,

25
00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:22.545
maybe 10 or 15 years to understand or have a context for it,

26
00:01:22.545 --> 00:01:24.066
and I didn't share it with anybody.

27
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:26.465
It was just when I was going to sleep at night

28
00:01:26.465 --> 00:01:29.965
in between the waking and the sleep state,

29
00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:33.165
I just got the feeling of light and energy,

30
00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:34.914
and it was...

31
00:01:36.144 --> 00:01:39.008
it was kind of nerve wracking at the time, it was scary.

32
00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:41.309
It was really scary, and it happened to me every day.

33
00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:42.749
And I didn't really tell anybody about it.

34
00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:44.208
I didn't know what it was.

35
00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:49.208
And it was like, it was like energy coming into my brain,

36
00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.428
and it made me feel like I was actually literally gonna die.

37
00:01:53.428 --> 00:01:55.288
Every night.

38
00:01:55.288 --> 00:01:58.649
And it sounds terrible because maybe to a 12-year-old,

39
00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.228
I can't imagine my son right now who's 13 going through

40
00:02:01.228 --> 00:02:04.008
something like this, and I didn't know what it was.

41
00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:08.929
So many years later I think things shifted that when I would

42
00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.569
go to sleep in the dream state it'd be more peaceful.

43
00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.889
It'd be like lying on a beach next to an ocean,

44
00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:18.889
it was like 90 degrees, blue sky.

45
00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.069
It was really beautiful, and I'd feel energy coming up

46
00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.749
into my body, and it would be like glowing light

47
00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:28.288
from under my heart surrounding my head.

48
00:02:28.288 --> 00:02:31.448
And it was just a wonderful feeling.

49
00:02:31.448 --> 00:02:32.968
It was almost like something was working through me,

50
00:02:32.968 --> 00:02:34.088
and I don't know what it was,

51
00:02:34.088 --> 00:02:36.509
and I still didn't share that with anybody.

52
00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:41.509
And I'd say into the early '80's then

53
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.330
I just, I guess I became accustomed to this.

54
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.730
And I didn't still have any context.

55
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.930
I didn't have any understanding of any religious principles

56
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.190
or spiritual principles, I didn't know.

57
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.670
And then I met some folks and ended up,

58
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.751
while I was working on my master's degree in marine biology.

59
00:02:59.751 --> 00:03:03.231
I was studying dolphin communication at Catalina Island.

60
00:03:03.231 --> 00:03:06.891
Then I was living in San Diego then in the early '80's.

61
00:03:06.891 --> 00:03:10.892
I ended up meeting a medicine woman in Mexico.

62
00:03:10.892 --> 00:03:15.072
She was a combination Christian Aztec medicine woman.

63
00:03:15.072 --> 00:03:15.932
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

64
00:03:15.932 --> 00:03:18.532
<v ->And she lived in the mountains outside of Ticate,</v>

65
00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:20.812
northern Baja California.

66
00:03:20.812 --> 00:03:25.812
And she got a calling when she was young in a church

67
00:03:26.332 --> 00:03:30.272
in Guadalajara, really kind of like Mother Teresa.

68
00:03:30.272 --> 00:03:33.052
She got a calling to serve the poorest of the poor

69
00:03:33.052 --> 00:03:35.292
and heal them.

70
00:03:35.292 --> 00:03:40.292
So I met her and decided to move down for a year.

71
00:03:40.433 --> 00:03:42.173
I got rid of all, I don't know why I did this,

72
00:03:42.173 --> 00:03:43.984
one of those things where you just...

73
00:03:44.753 --> 00:03:46.494
I sold my belongings.

74
00:03:46.494 --> 00:03:49.264
I just had, I guess I had my car, and I didn't speak

75
00:03:49.264 --> 00:03:52.375
Spanish very well, but I was living in a tent for a year

76
00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:54.015
on her land.

77
00:03:54.015 --> 00:03:56.655
And she had a healing room where people came from

78
00:03:56.655 --> 00:03:59.435
all over the region, a lot of indigenous people that

79
00:03:59.435 --> 00:04:00.495
came for healing.

80
00:04:00.495 --> 00:04:02.835
And people would bring like some food or something

81
00:04:02.835 --> 00:04:06.395
to exchange, so it was no money transferred.

82
00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:08.755
It was just people brought whatever in exchange for healing,

83
00:04:08.755 --> 00:04:12.655
so I was learning with her, and it was just really amazing.

84
00:04:12.655 --> 00:04:15.155
I didn't really learn anything like technical.

85
00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:17.738
Like I didn't become a quote healer 'cause I guess

86
00:04:17.738 --> 00:04:19.394
I wasn't looking at it that way.

87
00:04:19.394 --> 00:04:23.644
It was more I was able to be in the presence of a woman

88
00:04:23.644 --> 00:04:28.165
who's in many ways transcended her ego,

89
00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:32.005
and to live a life of love and service, and really do it.

90
00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:34.156
<v Regina>And that was your attraction to her.</v>

91
00:04:34.156 --> 00:04:36.236
And did she invite you to come and be with her

92
00:04:36.236 --> 00:04:38.796
and help her, or how did this happen for you?

93
00:04:38.796 --> 00:04:40.076
<v ->Well you know, it was really interesting.</v>

94
00:04:40.076 --> 00:04:43.056
I went down there one time for a Sunday visit

95
00:04:43.056 --> 00:04:44.537
where we were sitting around,

96
00:04:44.537 --> 00:04:47.337
and that was just a Sunday with her family.

97
00:04:47.337 --> 00:04:49.497
She had a large family there.

98
00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:53.697
And I went home that night, and I had a dream.

99
00:04:53.697 --> 00:04:56.997
Actually it was a series of dreams, and in this first dream

100
00:04:56.997 --> 00:04:58.877
she actually was in it.

101
00:04:58.877 --> 00:05:02.857
And it was a really profound experience because we were

102
00:05:02.857 --> 00:05:07.697
in a forest, and I was taking her to, I had some reason

103
00:05:07.697 --> 00:05:09.417
to take her to some place.

104
00:05:09.417 --> 00:05:14.257
And I was taking her on a forest path to a spring,

105
00:05:14.257 --> 00:05:17.497
it was a natural spring that had light bubbling up

106
00:05:17.497 --> 00:05:20.517
from within it, and there were like Native American ladies

107
00:05:20.517 --> 00:05:22.157
that were kind of--

108
00:05:22.157 --> 00:05:23.377
<v Regina>How beautiful.</v>

109
00:05:23.377 --> 00:05:25.717
just kind of an experience of joy, and I looked,

110
00:05:25.717 --> 00:05:27.432
and Catalina was happy.

111
00:05:27.432 --> 00:05:29.112
So I didn't know what that meant.

112
00:05:29.112 --> 00:05:31.212
And then there was a series of other dreams

113
00:05:31.212 --> 00:05:34.152
that indicated that I should take it seriously.

114
00:05:34.152 --> 00:05:37.852
So I was in the middle of my, actually almost finished

115
00:05:37.852 --> 00:05:39.112
with my master's program,.

116
00:05:39.112 --> 00:05:43.736
So I came from a scientific world view,

117
00:05:43.736 --> 00:05:46.436
and Catalina had a different world view.

118
00:05:46.436 --> 00:05:50.216
And it was great because then I could really balance them

119
00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:52.901
and developed kind of a holistic world view that didn't

120
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:56.186
throw one out and another

121
00:05:56.186 --> 00:05:57.586
and just go with some new world view.

122
00:05:57.586 --> 00:05:59.746
It was more of a balance.

123
00:05:59.746 --> 00:06:02.771
So I for whatever reason I went down there,

124
00:06:02.771 --> 00:06:06.251
and I spent three days in this cave on a mountain

125
00:06:06.251 --> 00:06:08.371
that was next to her property.

126
00:06:08.371 --> 00:06:11.331
And I don't know why I did that, but I just had water,

127
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:14.431
and I was just sitting there, and I was praying.

128
00:06:14.431 --> 00:06:19.331
And then I came down, and that's when she was telling me

129
00:06:19.331 --> 00:06:20.411
something that was kinda funny.

130
00:06:20.411 --> 00:06:21.911
She was saying that there was like a cloud

131
00:06:21.911 --> 00:06:24.751
over the mountain, so this is her world view.

132
00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:27.939
You know, I come from a rational scientific background,

133
00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:29.499
so it was really different.

134
00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:31.359
And she said, well this was this cloud over the mountain.

135
00:06:31.359 --> 00:06:32.399
I said, well what was it?

136
00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:34.499
She said, I hadn't seen one like that for 35 years.

137
00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:38.079
And she said, it was a big healing.

138
00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:38.999
She was talking about me.

139
00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:39.819
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

140
00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:43.799
<v ->And then she, you know, didn't exactly invite me,</v>

141
00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:46.019
but we just became friends.

142
00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:50.139
And then it seemed like there was an opening,

143
00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:55.139
and she enjoyed my company, so I just moved down there.

144
00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:57.679
<v Regina>So you lived in a tent and facilitated,</v>

145
00:06:57.679 --> 00:06:58.939
you were her assistant you say.

146
00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:00.619
<v ->Yeah, I was just learning--
<v Regina>An apprentice.</v>

147
00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:05.579
with her, yeah, and she just used healing with herbs,

148
00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:09.899
and she would pray to do what would be called

149
00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:13.819
spiritual healing, and she invoked more from the

150
00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:16.659
Christian point of view the name of the father,

151
00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:18.639
the son and the holy spirit.

152
00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:23.199
So she emptied herself of her ego in this prayer

153
00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:27.359
and asked God to help her to be a channel

154
00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:31.767
to help the people that came to her.

155
00:07:31.767 --> 00:07:34.287
And I just saw some amazing things that were

156
00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:37.066
happening there, and I was just taking it all in.

157
00:07:37.066 --> 00:07:39.266
So it was part of my own growth,

158
00:07:39.266 --> 00:07:41.546
and that was in the mid '80's.

159
00:07:41.546 --> 00:07:45.246
<v Regina>And after that Tibetan Buddhism, a retreat?</v>

160
00:07:45.246 --> 00:07:47.651
<v ->Well you know, then it was another opportunity.</v>

161
00:07:47.651 --> 00:07:50.431
I was looking for a place to live, and I was actually,

162
00:07:50.431 --> 00:07:52.791
actually this was, in fact it was prior to that.

163
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:54.711
I'm getting the timeline out of sync,

164
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:58.851
but there was a residential retreat center with a

165
00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:01.491
Tibetan Lama, so even though I was raised in the

166
00:08:01.491 --> 00:08:04.931
Jewish tradition, I was raised Jewish, my family's Jewish

167
00:08:04.931 --> 00:08:09.051
from Russia, I lived in this house.

168
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:12.911
And there was a Tibetan monk that taught traditional

169
00:08:12.911 --> 00:08:15.171
Tibetan Buddhist meditation.

170
00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:17.791
So that's where I learned to do meditation,

171
00:08:17.791 --> 00:08:20.342
and that was part of that unfolding.

172
00:08:20.811 --> 00:08:22.711
<v Regina>Is that where you recognized what that light was</v>

173
00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:25.271
that had been coming into your head during that

174
00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:27.411
in between state as a youth?

175
00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:32.251
<v ->Well you know, some people explained it to me,</v>

176
00:08:32.251 --> 00:08:36.811
and they used kind of an eastern religious term,

177
00:08:36.811 --> 00:08:39.131
kundalini, I didn't know anything about it,

178
00:08:39.131 --> 00:08:41.931
but names don't really mean much to me,

179
00:08:41.931 --> 00:08:43.841
like labeling something.

180
00:08:45.072 --> 00:08:48.931
I just realize that the purpose of these experiences

181
00:08:48.931 --> 00:08:52.711
is to kind of like wake you up to look deeper.

182
00:08:52.711 --> 00:08:55.192
So the experience in itself is not important.

183
00:08:55.192 --> 00:08:58.292
In fact, having these experiences means that you've got

184
00:08:58.292 --> 00:09:01.971
a lot of blockages inside, a lot of resistance.

185
00:09:01.971 --> 00:09:03.571
So they kind of burst out.

186
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:04.532
It's kind of like cleaning.

187
00:09:04.532 --> 00:09:05.811
It's kind of like I guess you could call it--

188
00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:06.751
<v Regina>Roto rooter.</v>

189
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:08.671
<v ->Cosmic roto rooter, there you go.</v>

190
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:10.812
And you know, I started to read a little bit

191
00:09:10.812 --> 00:09:13.271
more about it, but I wasn't too much into that.

192
00:09:13.271 --> 00:09:17.131
I was just into understanding more of myself,

193
00:09:17.131 --> 00:09:21.252
and after that experience with Catalina I was kind of,

194
00:09:21.252 --> 00:09:23.411
didn't really know what I was gonna do,

195
00:09:23.411 --> 00:09:25.211
but I moved back into a neighborhood.

196
00:09:25.211 --> 00:09:28.232
It was a low income Hispanic neighborhood

197
00:09:28.232 --> 00:09:30.571
in San Diego called Sherman Heights.

198
00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:32.591
<v Regina>And that's really where the path</v>

199
00:09:32.591 --> 00:09:34.251
you're on today took seed.

200
00:09:34.251 --> 00:09:36.311
<v ->Well, it's kind of interesting, yeah, you're right.</v>

201
00:09:36.311 --> 00:09:37.771
It started in there.

202
00:09:37.771 --> 00:09:41.771
I learned about Dr. A. T. Ariyaratne,

203
00:09:41.771 --> 00:09:44.950
who is the leader of the world's largest

204
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.272
spiritually based community movement called Sarvodaya.

205
00:09:48.272 --> 00:09:51.851
And Sarvodaya now is in half or 15,000 of the villages

206
00:09:51.851 --> 00:09:54.611
in Sri Lanka, involving millions of people,

207
00:09:54.611 --> 00:09:57.191
and he's been doing this for 50 years,

208
00:09:57.191 --> 00:10:01.531
50 year track record of linking spiritual awakening

209
00:10:01.531 --> 00:10:04.711
with practical social and economic change.

210
00:10:04.711 --> 00:10:08.192
And the way that they do it that was just really amazing

211
00:10:08.192 --> 00:10:10.552
is that they don't involve the government.

212
00:10:10.552 --> 00:10:14.311
They're building a new society by getting people to

213
00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:17.411
work together at the grass roots to manifest a

214
00:10:17.411 --> 00:10:19.931
spiritually based people's power.

215
00:10:19.931 --> 00:10:23.132
See we have trouble with that here because our whole society

216
00:10:23.132 --> 00:10:27.171
is embedded in a political, social, economic matrix,

217
00:10:27.171 --> 00:10:30.251
so you can't get out of it, we're stuck in it.

218
00:10:30.251 --> 00:10:32.551
<v Regina>Hard to fathom having them listen to</v>

219
00:10:32.551 --> 00:10:37.231
a spiritual guide or influence of any kind.

220
00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:39.831
<v ->Well, it's so overpowering and overwhelming,</v>

221
00:10:39.831 --> 00:10:43.612
the consumer materialistic society for the development

222
00:10:43.612 --> 00:10:46.912
of the desire and hunger for spiritual awareness

223
00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:48.411
in the United States.

224
00:10:48.411 --> 00:10:51.551
But in these villages they didn't have any infrastructure.

225
00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:54.391
They didn't have like you know places to irrigate.

226
00:10:54.391 --> 00:10:57.772
They didn't have like farming, small businesses, preschools.

227
00:10:57.772 --> 00:11:01.131
So in that context Dr. Ari learned that you could like

228
00:11:01.131 --> 00:11:04.851
traditional spiritual practices, and in their society

229
00:11:04.851 --> 00:11:07.652
it's Buddhist principles of meditation and compassion

230
00:11:07.652 --> 00:11:10.651
and loving kindness, and link that to practical efforts

231
00:11:10.651 --> 00:11:13.151
to build the community.

232
00:11:13.151 --> 00:11:16.151
So in a sense they're building like a parallel

233
00:11:16.151 --> 00:11:19.671
alternative society, and they incorporate as a

234
00:11:19.671 --> 00:11:22.814
Sarvodaa society, and eventually the village becomes

235
00:11:22.814 --> 00:11:25.411
self-reliant economically and starts helping and trading

236
00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:26.991
with other villages.

237
00:11:26.991 --> 00:11:28.771
<v Regina>How successful has this been?</v>

238
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:32.132
<v ->Well it's really, it's pretty mind boggling in that they,</v>

239
00:11:32.132 --> 00:11:36.391
for example they've built 5,000 preschools

240
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:38.112
in 5,000 villages.

241
00:11:38.112 --> 00:11:41.642
They've developed almost 5,000 village banks.

242
00:11:42.692 --> 00:11:43.711
<v Regina>Amazing.</v>

243
00:11:43.711 --> 00:11:45.431
<v ->It's phenomenal, it's phenomenal.</v>

244
00:11:45.431 --> 00:11:48.191
And Dr. Ari's been going around the world for the last

245
00:11:48.191 --> 00:11:51.591
couple decades, and I met him in the '90's in San Diego,

246
00:11:51.591 --> 00:11:54.972
and we became friends, kind of like a mentor.

247
00:11:54.972 --> 00:11:59.131
So I got influenced by that idea of linking spiritual

248
00:11:59.131 --> 00:12:02.131
and community action, outside of,

249
00:12:02.131 --> 00:12:04.071
in a non-political context.

250
00:12:04.071 --> 00:12:07.011
See we normally think of spiritual activism

251
00:12:07.011 --> 00:12:08.911
in a political context.

252
00:12:08.911 --> 00:12:12.331
So for example, we might be pro-abortion or anti-abortion,

253
00:12:12.331 --> 00:12:15.191
or pro-capital punishment or against capital punishment.

254
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:18.111
So we think of our spiritual activism as lobbying

255
00:12:18.111 --> 00:12:20.471
the existing institutions,

256
00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:22.931
the power structure that we have in our society,

257
00:12:22.931 --> 00:12:26.211
rather than trying to build a new society from scratch

258
00:12:26.211 --> 00:12:28.372
at the grass roots, which is what they're doing.

259
00:12:28.372 --> 00:12:30.471
They don't ask the government for help.

260
00:12:30.471 --> 00:12:31.951
They don't believe in welfare.

261
00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:34.071
They're actually getting people together to take care of

262
00:12:34.071 --> 00:12:35.651
their own needs.

263
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:36.631
<v Regina>Beautiful.</v>

264
00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:38.451
<v ->And they start with the poorest of the poor.</v>

265
00:12:38.451 --> 00:12:41.191
So if they can do that, I figured I learned, gosh,

266
00:12:41.191 --> 00:12:43.311
you know that's something to really look at.

267
00:12:43.311 --> 00:12:47.351
So Dr. Ari is actually considered the Gandhi of Sri Lanka

268
00:12:47.351 --> 00:12:51.411
because he has merged some of Gandhian ideas of

269
00:12:51.411 --> 00:12:54.852
non-violence and cooperation and peace with

270
00:12:54.852 --> 00:12:58.012
traditional Buddhist ideas of loving kindness

271
00:12:58.012 --> 00:12:59.551
and compassion.

272
00:12:59.551 --> 00:13:01.111
So he's merged that together.

273
00:13:01.111 --> 00:13:03.631
So Mahatma Gandhi in his constructive program

274
00:13:03.631 --> 00:13:05.271
also called it Sarvodaya.

275
00:13:05.271 --> 00:13:09.591
Dr. Ari retranslated it, created a new context for it.

276
00:13:09.591 --> 00:13:11.661
Gandhi called it,

277
00:13:13.971 --> 00:13:17.351
it had to do with revitalizing the villages there,

278
00:13:17.351 --> 00:13:20.911
so Gandhi created a term that's stuck with me ever since,

279
00:13:20.911 --> 00:13:25.911
which was building a commonwealth of village republics.

280
00:13:25.931 --> 00:13:26.971
<v Regina>Beautiful.</v>

281
00:13:26.971 --> 00:13:30.731
<v ->So the idea is that after a century or more of British</v>

282
00:13:30.731 --> 00:13:35.731
colonial rule the villagers had lost a lot of self respect,

283
00:13:36.171 --> 00:13:39.212
and they've lost economic and social power because

284
00:13:39.212 --> 00:13:41.851
they were taking the resources back to Britain

285
00:13:41.851 --> 00:13:43.391
to mass produce it.

286
00:13:43.391 --> 00:13:47.491
For example, the raw materials to make textiles, clothing,

287
00:13:47.491 --> 00:13:49.631
so they actually took the raw materials back,

288
00:13:49.631 --> 00:13:53.291
whereas before the Indian people were self reliant

289
00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:54.571
in these villages.

290
00:13:54.571 --> 00:13:56.971
It was already a commonwealth of village republics.

291
00:13:56.971 --> 00:14:00.311
So as a result of the empire, the British empire,

292
00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:02.511
they became very dependent.

293
00:14:02.511 --> 00:14:05.331
So that stuck with me because when Gandhi,

294
00:14:05.331 --> 00:14:08.831
as part of his program was to build up this capacity

295
00:14:08.831 --> 00:14:12.171
for self reliance within each village,

296
00:14:12.171 --> 00:14:14.771
and build a commonwealth of them, so an alternative society

297
00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:17.311
that's in parallel to that existing one.

298
00:14:17.311 --> 00:14:20.571
And then Dr. Ari actually is doing that in Sri Lanka.

299
00:14:20.571 --> 00:14:24.451
So I asked the question, well wow, if this is real,

300
00:14:24.451 --> 00:14:26.371
and it's happening in Sri Lanka, how do we translate

301
00:14:26.371 --> 00:14:29.851
some of these principles and ideas into the West?

302
00:14:29.851 --> 00:14:32.152
<v Regina>Very good question, and it has a totally</v>

303
00:14:32.152 --> 00:14:34.131
different set of challenges because it does have

304
00:14:34.131 --> 00:14:36.191
an infrastructure.

305
00:14:36.191 --> 00:14:37.851
<v ->No, that's right.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

306
00:14:37.851 --> 00:14:39.691
<v ->We have an already existing infrastructure,</v>

307
00:14:39.691 --> 00:14:41.471
so you're not starting from scratch and building

308
00:14:41.471 --> 00:14:43.832
new infrastructure, which on some level is easier,

309
00:14:43.832 --> 00:14:46.531
because now we almost have too much infrastructure.

310
00:14:46.531 --> 00:14:49.471
We have all these competing business associations,

311
00:14:49.471 --> 00:14:53.431
social groups, religious groups, political belief systems.

312
00:14:53.431 --> 00:14:57.451
We're kind of a mixture of all these competing interests.

313
00:14:57.451 --> 00:15:02.091
So whereas they have to build infrastructure,

314
00:15:02.091 --> 00:15:05.811
what I figured through my work in San Diego and then

315
00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:09.891
in Torino now with the conscious community network is that

316
00:15:09.891 --> 00:15:11.951
instead of having to build something new,

317
00:15:11.951 --> 00:15:14.691
what we needed is a vehicle to connect those that are

318
00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:17.051
already doing good to support them.

319
00:15:17.051 --> 00:15:18.991
<v Regina>Yes, and let's go back to San Diego</v>

320
00:15:18.991 --> 00:15:20.339
and how you started.

321
00:15:20.339 --> 00:15:22.919
You did some really interesting things there.

322
00:15:22.919 --> 00:15:24.919
<v ->You know, thanks for bringing that up because</v>

323
00:15:24.919 --> 00:15:27.079
I guess I might have gone far afield.

324
00:15:27.079 --> 00:15:28.259
(Regina laughs)

325
00:15:28.259 --> 00:15:31.919
One example where I really learned this principle of

326
00:15:31.919 --> 00:15:35.279
bringing and connecting the kind of disparate elements

327
00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:37.759
of a given community together, so instead of creating

328
00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:40.479
something new, like just another organization,

329
00:15:40.479 --> 00:15:43.379
what we learned was that a group of people can become

330
00:15:43.379 --> 00:15:46.895
a catalyst for total community change by bringing together

331
00:15:46.895 --> 00:15:49.455
all the players and individuals in a community

332
00:15:49.455 --> 00:15:51.555
who really care about the community.

333
00:15:51.555 --> 00:15:54.736
So in this one neighborhood, it's called Logan Heights,

334
00:15:54.736 --> 00:15:56.975
I was living on this street, I moved onto this street

335
00:15:56.975 --> 00:15:58.495
as a community organizer.

336
00:15:58.495 --> 00:16:03.495
And it was filled with violence every day.

337
00:16:04.556 --> 00:16:07.656
On this one corner there were like 40 drug dealers.

338
00:16:07.656 --> 00:16:10.335
It was like the crack and marijuana capital of

339
00:16:10.335 --> 00:16:11.555
San Diego County.

340
00:16:11.555 --> 00:16:14.716
It was a low income neighborhood.

341
00:16:14.716 --> 00:16:19.357
The area was African American and Latino area,

342
00:16:19.357 --> 00:16:22.277
so it was in a very low income.

343
00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:26.725
Most of the businesses were owned by outside folks

344
00:16:26.725 --> 00:16:30.145
that came in, mostly like liquor stores, convenience stores.

345
00:16:30.145 --> 00:16:31.685
There weren't any supermarkets 'cause they

346
00:16:31.685 --> 00:16:33.585
moved out in the '60's.

347
00:16:33.585 --> 00:16:37.305
Most of the homes, like probably 85% of the homes,

348
00:16:37.305 --> 00:16:40.665
were absentee owned, they were renters, people were renters,

349
00:16:40.665 --> 00:16:43.585
so there wasn't a lot of ownership in the community.

350
00:16:43.585 --> 00:16:47.205
So there wasn't like a sense of who's gonna take

351
00:16:47.205 --> 00:16:50.886
responsibility for dealing with this drug trafficking

352
00:16:50.886 --> 00:16:52.545
and violence right on the street.

353
00:16:52.545 --> 00:16:55.425
The families just basically locked themselves

354
00:16:55.425 --> 00:16:57.465
in their homes.

355
00:16:58.405 --> 00:17:00.519
The police just drove by.

356
00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:03.159
The government didn't do anything at the time

357
00:17:03.159 --> 00:17:04.899
for all the code violations.

358
00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:07.320
You know, there were houses there where

359
00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.779
the roofs were leaking, there was mold in there,

360
00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:13.519
and kids were getting sick, and I was seeing all this.

361
00:17:13.519 --> 00:17:18.519
Basically I guessed it had reached such a point where

362
00:17:18.939 --> 00:17:22.879
we were able to bring, through cooperating with the local

363
00:17:22.879 --> 00:17:25.559
head start school, there was a school on this street,

364
00:17:25.559 --> 00:17:30.559
and there was a great leader of that school who

365
00:17:31.359 --> 00:17:32.779
we partnered with.

366
00:17:32.779 --> 00:17:36.479
So we kinda brought together some nucleus of people,

367
00:17:36.479 --> 00:17:38.039
and then we called a meeting.

368
00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:40.057
<v Regina>And who were some of the other players,</v>

369
00:17:40.057 --> 00:17:41.297
besides the head start?

370
00:17:41.297 --> 00:17:44.197
<v ->There was a professor at San Diego State University</v>

371
00:17:44.197 --> 00:17:46.997
who actually got a grant, you know, who was able to

372
00:17:46.997 --> 00:17:49.357
get some support because he was really interested

373
00:17:49.357 --> 00:17:51.937
in community development.

374
00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:54.937
There was folks that were interested in local food,

375
00:17:54.937 --> 00:17:57.697
and that's something that was developed later,

376
00:17:57.697 --> 00:17:59.957
a food cooperative, and then a store,

377
00:17:59.957 --> 00:18:01.437
and then a community center.

378
00:18:01.437 --> 00:18:04.477
But we started with just the reality and facing

379
00:18:04.477 --> 00:18:06.175
the reality of the violence.

380
00:18:06.175 --> 00:18:08.175
<v Regina>Were there members of the community there--</v>

381
00:18:08.175 --> 00:18:09.455
<v ->Oh yes, yes.
represented there, too.

382
00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:13.995
<v ->You know, we started to reach out to some of the churches,</v>

383
00:18:13.995 --> 00:18:16.555
some of the business leaders, but initially it was primarily

384
00:18:16.555 --> 00:18:18.715
the grass roots folks.

385
00:18:18.715 --> 00:18:23.155
Initially it was that because this is what we figured out.

386
00:18:23.155 --> 00:18:24.696
<v Regina>Like moms and dads--</v>

387
00:18:24.696 --> 00:18:26.735
<v ->Yeah, moms, yeah, yeah, exactly.</v>

388
00:18:26.735 --> 00:18:29.555
it was just average people who really didn't wanna

389
00:18:29.555 --> 00:18:31.715
lock themselves in their homes anymore.

390
00:18:31.715 --> 00:18:34.315
Kids couldn't walk down the street.

391
00:18:34.315 --> 00:18:37.476
So we had a meeting, and people were gathered,

392
00:18:37.476 --> 00:18:39.755
and we did some simple things.

393
00:18:39.755 --> 00:18:43.535
We started with just a gathering on the street where

394
00:18:43.535 --> 00:18:46.335
people would do like a march for peace.

395
00:18:47.233 --> 00:18:50.713
And it was really right in the middle of this kind of chaos

396
00:18:50.713 --> 00:18:53.413
where people would, you know, it's kind of like

397
00:18:53.413 --> 00:18:57.773
self assertion, people reestablishing a sense of dignity,

398
00:18:57.773 --> 00:19:00.413
and you know, I don't wanna tolerate this in my community.

399
00:19:00.413 --> 00:19:04.893
Anyway, so that led to other kinds of things like

400
00:19:04.893 --> 00:19:09.113
cleaning up empty lots that had all sorts of refuse

401
00:19:09.113 --> 00:19:10.493
and stuff in it.

402
00:19:10.493 --> 00:19:15.173
And then that led to more meetings to discuss

403
00:19:15.173 --> 00:19:16.433
practically what to do.

404
00:19:16.433 --> 00:19:19.353
There were like 10 drug houses on this one street,

405
00:19:19.353 --> 00:19:22.533
and the government wasn't very successful in

406
00:19:22.533 --> 00:19:24.113
abating those houses.

407
00:19:24.113 --> 00:19:27.253
It took the government years through legal process

408
00:19:27.253 --> 00:19:31.973
to actually get the owner to be cooperative to not allow

409
00:19:31.973 --> 00:19:33.691
that kind of behavior there.

410
00:19:33.691 --> 00:19:35.311
The owners were not living there, and they just

411
00:19:35.311 --> 00:19:38.011
collected their rent money.

412
00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:41.391
So by mobilizing the community, by bringing together

413
00:19:41.391 --> 00:19:46.231
all these different interests like the police department,

414
00:19:46.231 --> 00:19:49.971
the building code enforcement people with the city

415
00:19:49.971 --> 00:19:54.272
of San Diego, the churches, and there was a Catholic church

416
00:19:54.272 --> 00:19:56.772
that was really involved, the leader of that church

417
00:19:56.772 --> 00:20:01.212
got involved, and some of the business owners got involved,

418
00:20:01.212 --> 00:20:03.592
we started to build a nucleus.

419
00:20:03.592 --> 00:20:06.311
And then just symbolic acts.

420
00:20:06.311 --> 00:20:09.411
For example, you know, a lot of the men on this

421
00:20:09.411 --> 00:20:12.431
particular street really were,

422
00:20:12.431 --> 00:20:14.371
they were kind of hanging out together,

423
00:20:14.371 --> 00:20:17.551
but they were just maybe drinking beer on the side

424
00:20:17.551 --> 00:20:20.411
of the road because it's kind of a, it was a miserable life.

425
00:20:20.411 --> 00:20:22.631
I mean, all the drug dealing, and women and children

426
00:20:22.631 --> 00:20:26.851
couldn't go out, but the men weren't really

427
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.551
being responsible.

428
00:20:28.551 --> 00:20:30.272
They were just hanging out on the street,

429
00:20:30.272 --> 00:20:32.691
so I actually got them together,

430
00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:35.311
and I got some religious leaders, and we walked to

431
00:20:35.311 --> 00:20:37.911
the corner where all these drug deals were happening.

432
00:20:37.911 --> 00:20:40.411
So we just sat in the midst of them every night,

433
00:20:40.411 --> 00:20:45.411
and we said we love you, but we don't love your behavior.

434
00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:47.831
So we kind of established a connection with them,

435
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:49.671
that we weren't angry at them.

436
00:20:49.671 --> 00:20:53.191
So that's kind of in a sense it's a non-violent aspect

437
00:20:53.191 --> 00:20:55.851
of approach like Martin Luther King would use,

438
00:20:55.851 --> 00:20:58.291
or that I learned from Mahatma Gandhi.

439
00:20:58.291 --> 00:21:00.831
Actually Mahatma Gandhi learned that from studying

440
00:21:00.831 --> 00:21:03.471
the Sermon on the Mount about non-resistance,

441
00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:07.171
now you confront evil in this world, how you can overcome

442
00:21:07.171 --> 00:21:10.471
our own anger and hostility to cultivate love

443
00:21:10.471 --> 00:21:14.351
so we can go beyond our own desire for punishment,

444
00:21:14.351 --> 00:21:16.411
so we can get right to the root of the problem.

445
00:21:16.411 --> 00:21:19.511
So what we got the folks to do is say that we love them,

446
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:22.591
but that we're not gonna tolerate their behavior.

447
00:21:22.591 --> 00:21:24.511
That's really an amazing--
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

448
00:21:24.511 --> 00:21:26.131
and powerful statement.

449
00:21:26.131 --> 00:21:29.491
And I got the men active, so you know, to get involved,

450
00:21:29.491 --> 00:21:34.491
and through time we got the different aspects of the city

451
00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:37.931
that should have been involved, like the police,

452
00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:40.331
to really be supportive,

453
00:21:40.331 --> 00:21:42.631
so we worked in partnership with them.

454
00:21:42.631 --> 00:21:44.931
So the networking principle that I learned is that

455
00:21:44.931 --> 00:21:48.271
a small core group of people can bring together

456
00:21:48.271 --> 00:21:51.711
all the players and people that are involved in

457
00:21:51.711 --> 00:21:55.471
organizations as well throughout a community when nobody

458
00:21:55.471 --> 00:21:59.331
may be taking responsibility because everybody's waiting

459
00:21:59.331 --> 00:22:01.369
for someone else to do it, so nobody does anything.

460
00:22:01.369 --> 00:22:02.229
<v Regina>Right.</v>

461
00:22:02.229 --> 00:22:04.469
<v ->We brought everybody together, and it created this synergy</v>

462
00:22:04.469 --> 00:22:08.529
and a nucleus, and later we called this community weaving,

463
00:22:08.529 --> 00:22:10.949
so we're weaving the community together to solve

464
00:22:10.949 --> 00:22:12.249
a common problem.

465
00:22:12.249 --> 00:22:16.049
And we did it, I believe, from a perspective of

466
00:22:16.049 --> 00:22:18.309
a higher principle of love.

467
00:22:18.309 --> 00:22:20.689
That wasn't really clear at the time.

468
00:22:20.689 --> 00:22:23.909
That took many years to understand, you know,

469
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:26.449
how to bring together, how people are brought together

470
00:22:26.449 --> 00:22:29.289
with a common spiritual ideal.

471
00:22:29.289 --> 00:22:32.089
That came later, but that was an experience of

472
00:22:32.089 --> 00:22:34.589
network weaving and how to help people to take

473
00:22:34.589 --> 00:22:38.169
responsibiliity and overcome inertia.

474
00:22:38.169 --> 00:22:39.769
<v Regina>Yeah, what a wonderful example.</v>

475
00:22:39.769 --> 00:22:42.349
I mean, you went into the most hardcore situation,

476
00:22:42.349 --> 00:22:44.889
but what a great place to cut your teeth because

477
00:22:44.889 --> 00:22:48.769
then later you wanted to try, as time went on,

478
00:22:48.769 --> 00:22:50.689
I know you've done a number of things through the years,

479
00:22:50.689 --> 00:22:54.709
but let's stay on the theme of the conscious community

480
00:22:54.709 --> 00:22:59.375
development, and now here we are many years later in Reno

481
00:22:59.375 --> 00:23:01.795
where you started taking some of the principles that

482
00:23:01.795 --> 00:23:03.575
you've learned through the years and applying them.

483
00:23:03.575 --> 00:23:07.315
And this has been a very organic process for you.

484
00:23:07.315 --> 00:23:09.435
You're still seeing how this whole thing

485
00:23:09.435 --> 00:23:10.955
unfolds to this day.

486
00:23:10.955 --> 00:23:14.495
So can you talk about what your intention was here in Reno,

487
00:23:14.495 --> 00:23:17.635
and how you began the process of doing what you call

488
00:23:17.635 --> 00:23:19.155
community weaving?

489
00:23:19.155 --> 00:23:21.176
<v ->You know, we didn't understand it as weaving,</v>

490
00:23:21.176 --> 00:23:24.605
but I'll kinda back track, and then I'll fast forward it.

491
00:23:25.803 --> 00:23:28.264
When we started it was five years ago.

492
00:23:28.264 --> 00:23:32.981
We had again the inspiration from Sarvodaya and what

493
00:23:32.981 --> 00:23:35.621
Martin Luther King was doing, and also Gandhi,

494
00:23:35.621 --> 00:23:39.021
and then Gandhi's inspired by really the simple message

495
00:23:39.021 --> 00:23:42.139
of love Jesus shared.

496
00:23:43.901 --> 00:23:47.129
So all of that really kind of was percolating, you know.

497
00:23:47.129 --> 00:23:51.729
So at the time I think I was not very comfortable sharing

498
00:23:51.729 --> 00:23:53.358
my own spiritual...

499
00:23:55.148 --> 00:23:57.469
I guess spirituality.

500
00:23:57.469 --> 00:24:02.009
And so instead of getting to the core of it,

501
00:24:02.009 --> 00:24:05.329
which I now understand is probably key,

502
00:24:05.329 --> 00:24:07.869
which is in consciousness and really shifting our

503
00:24:07.869 --> 00:24:10.509
own awareness and perception and try to develop a life

504
00:24:10.509 --> 00:24:14.256
beyond just the ego focused.

505
00:24:15.306 --> 00:24:19.226
At that time we had what we call pillars,

506
00:24:19.226 --> 00:24:22.026
so it was the social, economic and the spiritual.

507
00:24:22.026 --> 00:24:24.145
So we started with the economic 'cause I thought

508
00:24:24.145 --> 00:24:26.486
at that time it would be the easiest 'cause then you don't

509
00:24:26.486 --> 00:24:30.406
really have to get into maybe spirituality and discussion

510
00:24:30.406 --> 00:24:33.086
of virtues and kind of figuring out that stuff.

511
00:24:33.086 --> 00:24:34.726
<v Regina>Kind of the path of least resistance</v>

512
00:24:34.726 --> 00:24:36.106
in this culture.
<v ->I think so.</v>

513
00:24:36.106 --> 00:24:38.445
Yeah, I didn't know it at the time, but we built a network

514
00:24:38.445 --> 00:24:40.705
of several hundred small businesses and community

515
00:24:40.705 --> 00:24:43.806
organizations, so that was part of a larger effort

516
00:24:43.806 --> 00:24:47.966
that's being called now community economic localization.

517
00:24:47.966 --> 00:24:51.206
All around the world in probably hundreds if not thousands

518
00:24:51.206 --> 00:24:56.206
of communities people are seeing the impact of globalization

519
00:24:56.485 --> 00:24:59.146
and the fact that we're based on petroleum,

520
00:24:59.146 --> 00:25:01.345
this economy is based on petroleum, and it takes a lot of

521
00:25:01.345 --> 00:25:03.685
energy to move stuff and transport stuff.

522
00:25:03.685 --> 00:25:05.926
And right now with what's happening with oil,

523
00:25:05.926 --> 00:25:07.705
you see the bandwagon now.

524
00:25:07.705 --> 00:25:09.306
Everybody's trying to figure out about local,

525
00:25:09.306 --> 00:25:12.366
like local food, local economy, local energy,

526
00:25:12.366 --> 00:25:15.986
and we were in a sense I guess maybe a little

527
00:25:15.986 --> 00:25:18.606
ahead of the curve about five years ago.

528
00:25:18.606 --> 00:25:22.726
And I guess many people looked at it, maybe it was kinda

529
00:25:22.726 --> 00:25:25.026
funny or different, you know, 'cause we were

530
00:25:25.026 --> 00:25:26.185
just starting out.

531
00:25:26.185 --> 00:25:27.986
Now it's like everybody wants to do it.

532
00:25:27.986 --> 00:25:28.966
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

533
00:25:28.966 --> 00:25:30.906
<v ->It's really amazing how you push the envelope.</v>

534
00:25:30.906 --> 00:25:35.826
So if you can get the courage up to follow your dream,

535
00:25:35.826 --> 00:25:39.213
even in the face of maybe not a lot of support,

536
00:25:39.213 --> 00:25:41.433
then it's amazing what can happen.

537
00:25:41.433 --> 00:25:42.993
So that's what happened, we had these meetings,

538
00:25:42.993 --> 00:25:46.473
we just started building an infrastructure for a movement

539
00:25:46.473 --> 00:25:50.913
by having maybe, we had maybe 50 to 100 people

540
00:25:50.913 --> 00:25:52.633
at a meeting every month.

541
00:25:52.633 --> 00:25:55.733
And these are business community leaders,

542
00:25:55.733 --> 00:26:00.733
but small businesses, like mom and pops,

543
00:26:01.188 --> 00:26:03.868
the little guy, gal, the folks.

544
00:26:03.868 --> 00:26:05.069
<v Regina>Not the casinos?</v>

545
00:26:05.069 --> 00:26:07.068
They didn't show up?
<v ->You know, actually we did.</v>

546
00:26:07.068 --> 00:26:09.549
I mean, some of them are local, locally owned,

547
00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:11.708
so we did invite them, but some of the big guys

548
00:26:11.708 --> 00:26:13.668
weren't interested initially.

549
00:26:13.668 --> 00:26:15.448
Later on it developed like that.

550
00:26:15.448 --> 00:26:16.508
<v Regina>That would be interesting.</v>

551
00:26:16.508 --> 00:26:17.908
When we get to that part I wanna know

552
00:26:17.908 --> 00:26:19.308
how that turns out.
<v ->Well, it was seen, you know,</v>

553
00:26:19.308 --> 00:26:22.628
I guess it was maybe seen as kind of a liberal, left leaning

554
00:26:22.628 --> 00:26:25.008
environmental kinda crowd kinda thing.

555
00:26:25.008 --> 00:26:27.968
That's how maybe it was branded in the public's mind

556
00:26:27.968 --> 00:26:30.028
what it was, and maybe it was some of that,

557
00:26:30.028 --> 00:26:32.408
but we grew and expanded.

558
00:26:32.408 --> 00:26:35.009
So in the beginning, so we started with these meetings,

559
00:26:35.009 --> 00:26:40.009
and the meetings created a space for self organization.

560
00:26:40.528 --> 00:26:42.308
That is we had sub groups.

561
00:26:42.308 --> 00:26:44.568
We had small groups of people in the context of a

562
00:26:44.568 --> 00:26:47.568
bigger meeting where people were actually flushing out

563
00:26:47.568 --> 00:26:51.448
the form of the infrastructure that we needed to support

564
00:26:51.448 --> 00:26:54.408
this kind of effort, to support the local economy.

565
00:26:54.408 --> 00:26:57.948
And so that's how it developed.

566
00:26:57.948 --> 00:27:00.368
So the principle there is something that people are

567
00:27:00.368 --> 00:27:03.048
talking a lot more about now, which is called emergence.

568
00:27:03.048 --> 00:27:05.928
So there's a collective intelligence that can happen

569
00:27:05.928 --> 00:27:08.368
when you bring a group of people who are really different.

570
00:27:08.368 --> 00:27:11.748
They come together, and if they focus on an issue

571
00:27:11.748 --> 00:27:14.328
that's of concern to them, and they can learn to go

572
00:27:14.328 --> 00:27:19.328
beyond their egoic reaction to maybe people are different,

573
00:27:19.488 --> 00:27:21.408
you know, like you might have a Democrat and a Republican,

574
00:27:21.408 --> 00:27:23.488
or you might have a Christian and a non-Christian,

575
00:27:23.488 --> 00:27:25.368
or whatever, you have all this kind of mix.

576
00:27:25.368 --> 00:27:27.508
If you can keep your eyes on the prize that we're trying

577
00:27:27.508 --> 00:27:32.029
to overcome ourselves in the context of building community.

578
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:33.608
So we're not fighting against something.

579
00:27:33.608 --> 00:27:34.788
We're trying to build something.

580
00:27:34.788 --> 00:27:36.408
So we're looking for commonalities,

581
00:27:36.408 --> 00:27:39.148
and collective intelligence happens where this

582
00:27:39.148 --> 00:27:41.709
group mind develops, and out of that comes an

583
00:27:41.709 --> 00:27:45.308
emergent process that you can't predict.

584
00:27:45.308 --> 00:27:48.209
So it's kind of like, I don't know, I feel like it's

585
00:27:48.209 --> 00:27:51.168
been that way all along, this whole process.

586
00:27:51.168 --> 00:27:54.308
So it's never crystalized into some formal structure

587
00:27:54.308 --> 00:27:56.748
that's bureaucratic or tries to become part of the system

588
00:27:56.748 --> 00:28:00.228
or part of the power base that exists in this world.

589
00:28:00.228 --> 00:28:02.089
This is what I've learned is that it's important to

590
00:28:02.089 --> 00:28:06.109
keep being a catalyst, to keep this purity of intention

591
00:28:06.109 --> 00:28:09.208
so that you're not like sucked in where you're trying to

592
00:28:09.208 --> 00:28:11.688
get somebody elected, thinking that that's gonna--

593
00:28:11.688 --> 00:28:13.028
<v Regina>Help your agenda.</v>

594
00:28:13.028 --> 00:28:15.148
<v ->Yeah, and it's kept pure.</v>

595
00:28:15.148 --> 00:28:18.428
It's pure what it is that we want.

596
00:28:18.428 --> 00:28:20.528
What kind of community do we want?

597
00:28:20.528 --> 00:28:22.928
What kind of life do we wanna live?

598
00:28:22.928 --> 00:28:24.788
And we get the people together around that,

599
00:28:24.788 --> 00:28:26.148
and it keeps deepening.

600
00:28:26.148 --> 00:28:29.568
So that was the first stage, and the second stage

601
00:28:29.568 --> 00:28:33.608
after about a year or two, kinda fast forwarding.

602
00:28:33.608 --> 00:28:36.998
Just before I go on, we developed a lot of, you know,

603
00:28:36.998 --> 00:28:40.869
I guess tools to help people become aware of the

604
00:28:40.869 --> 00:28:43.429
local economy and the little guy and gal.

605
00:28:43.429 --> 00:28:45.469
We developed a directory.

606
00:28:45.469 --> 00:28:47.389
We didn't know anything about printing and publishing,

607
00:28:47.389 --> 00:28:50.709
so we got a large group of people with different skills,

608
00:28:50.709 --> 00:28:52.149
and we just put it all together.

609
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:53.869
So we weren't a publishing house, we were just

610
00:28:53.869 --> 00:28:56.980
regular people, but we figured it out and produced

611
00:28:57.709 --> 00:28:59.911
tens of thousands of copies of this directory,

612
00:28:59.911 --> 00:29:01.271
and we had meetings.

613
00:29:01.271 --> 00:29:04.010
We had an online directory where people can connect,

614
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:05.331
so that was the beginning.

615
00:29:05.331 --> 00:29:08.651
That then led to focusing on another aspect of our

616
00:29:08.651 --> 00:29:11.930
local community, which is the local food system.

617
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:16.131
There wasn't like a network of organizations that were

618
00:29:16.131 --> 00:29:18.691
meeting regularly, so what we did was we'd used this

619
00:29:18.691 --> 00:29:22.011
breakfast meeting that we had been going now

620
00:29:22.011 --> 00:29:25.711
for two years, it started in '03, in 2003,

621
00:29:25.711 --> 00:29:29.711
and we applied the same principle of emergence

622
00:29:29.711 --> 00:29:33.751
and the fact of the conscious community being a catalyst,

623
00:29:33.751 --> 00:29:35.791
and not trying to just reinvent the wheel.

624
00:29:35.791 --> 00:29:39.011
We were just a catalyst, so I was able to identify

625
00:29:39.011 --> 00:29:42.611
some of the people that we became friends with,

626
00:29:42.611 --> 00:29:45.711
and we identified some key nodes, people that are

627
00:29:45.711 --> 00:29:49.831
really connected in that industry, in the food system,

628
00:29:49.831 --> 00:29:54.371
and we got 60 people at this breakfast meeting.

629
00:29:54.371 --> 00:29:58.111
And it was people like the farmers, the ranchers,

630
00:29:58.111 --> 00:30:00.671
the people that buy food for the school district,

631
00:30:00.671 --> 00:30:04.551
so institutional buying, the restauranteurs,

632
00:30:04.551 --> 00:30:06.791
people interested in local organic foods,

633
00:30:06.791 --> 00:30:11.191
so the food activists, people that are concerned with

634
00:30:11.191 --> 00:30:15.711
low income access to food, food security it's called.

635
00:30:15.711 --> 00:30:18.171
So the food bank, the WIC program and these other,

636
00:30:18.171 --> 00:30:19.692
so we brought everybody together.

637
00:30:19.692 --> 00:30:21.871
And I remember when we got everybody together

638
00:30:21.871 --> 00:30:25.131
this one leader of a community organization that

639
00:30:25.131 --> 00:30:27.731
deals with food, she got up and she said something like,

640
00:30:27.731 --> 00:30:30.531
you know, I've been wanting to do this for like eight years,

641
00:30:30.531 --> 00:30:33.531
bring everybody together, I just didn't have the time.

642
00:30:33.531 --> 00:30:38.311
So it got me thinking about how this self-organizing process

643
00:30:38.311 --> 00:30:42.151
can be helped, how we can help the emergence of

644
00:30:42.151 --> 00:30:45.551
real authentic community is that we gotta realize that

645
00:30:45.551 --> 00:30:48.512
we have all these players that they're already doing good,

646
00:30:48.512 --> 00:30:51.451
but they're just very busy, and people have

647
00:30:51.451 --> 00:30:54.072
defined territories that we work in.

648
00:30:54.072 --> 00:30:57.072
Whatever, it's a business, an organization, what have you.

649
00:30:57.072 --> 00:31:00.308
And it just took a small group of people to invite

650
00:31:00.308 --> 00:31:03.289
all these other folks that were themselves connected

651
00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:06.865
together to just really enjoy each other's company,

652
00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:08.226
so it was building trust.

653
00:31:08.226 --> 00:31:09.245
It's very simple.

654
00:31:09.245 --> 00:31:11.225
So then what happens was it turned out there was

655
00:31:11.225 --> 00:31:13.405
a small farm conference two months later,

656
00:31:13.405 --> 00:31:16.684
and this group of 50 became 100.

657
00:31:16.684 --> 00:31:20.445
And then they had a person who's worked with

658
00:31:20.445 --> 00:31:23.244
food systems from Morgan came down and helped

659
00:31:23.244 --> 00:31:25.985
facilitate a group process, and that led to the

660
00:31:25.985 --> 00:31:29.145
Local Food System Network in our region.

661
00:31:29.145 --> 00:31:31.585
<v Regina>And what have the effects of that been?</v>

662
00:31:31.585 --> 00:31:34.465
<v ->Well, they've continued to meet themselves,</v>

663
00:31:34.465 --> 00:31:37.585
and the way that Local Food System Network relates to

664
00:31:37.585 --> 00:31:40.885
the conscious community is that they're totally independent.

665
00:31:40.885 --> 00:31:42.965
It's not like our project or anything.

666
00:31:42.965 --> 00:31:46.805
See that's the first pitfall of trying to control

667
00:31:46.805 --> 00:31:50.405
this emergent process, is to try to say oh that's

668
00:31:50.405 --> 00:31:52.985
a project of me, that's the ego, see ego speaking.

669
00:31:52.985 --> 00:31:55.945
So what we did was consciously let stuff go.

670
00:31:55.945 --> 00:31:59.455
We just bring it together, and let it go, let it emerge.

671
00:31:59.455 --> 00:32:00.765
<v Regina>So what emerged?</v>

672
00:32:00.765 --> 00:32:04.325
<v ->Well, they met once a month, and there was already</v>

673
00:32:04.325 --> 00:32:06.545
a food cooperative kind of developing,

674
00:32:06.545 --> 00:32:09.865
so the Food System helped to strengthen that food coop

675
00:32:09.865 --> 00:32:12.805
to get new membership, and it brought resources to it

676
00:32:12.805 --> 00:32:17.365
so they can be strong financially, and build a structure.

677
00:32:17.365 --> 00:32:19.245
So there's like people already doing that,

678
00:32:19.245 --> 00:32:22.325
but they were then connected with people building

679
00:32:22.325 --> 00:32:24.304
what's called the Great Basin Basket Program,

680
00:32:24.304 --> 00:32:28.003
which is our area's community supported agriculture program.

681
00:32:28.003 --> 00:32:30.664
And that was also assisted in this process of bringing

682
00:32:30.664 --> 00:32:32.743
all the stakeholders in the area food.

683
00:32:32.743 --> 00:32:35.723
It accelerated the growth of that CSA, moreso--

684
00:32:35.723 --> 00:32:37.162
<v Regina>Talk about CSAs for just a moment,</v>

685
00:32:37.162 --> 00:32:38.783
for whoever doesn't know what this means.

686
00:32:38.783 --> 00:32:42.103
<v ->Well, community supported agriculture is a way in which</v>

687
00:32:42.103 --> 00:32:44.963
local consumers in a given area are connected

688
00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:48.363
directly to farmers, either through purchasing like a share

689
00:32:48.363 --> 00:32:53.363
in the farm, or giving maybe a certain dollar amount

690
00:32:53.543 --> 00:32:56.863
per week, and you get, in our case we get delivered

691
00:32:56.863 --> 00:33:01.863
a box of fresh produce and other food items once a week

692
00:33:02.363 --> 00:33:06.463
during the periods from June through October.

693
00:33:06.463 --> 00:33:09.563
And then there's gonna be a fall CSA.

694
00:33:09.563 --> 00:33:12.243
So we're actually now expanding almost to year round,

695
00:33:12.243 --> 00:33:16.723
even in a climate that is just, we live in a desert here,

696
00:33:16.723 --> 00:33:18.103
and it's really amazing.

697
00:33:18.103 --> 00:33:21.463
So that program has several hundred families

698
00:33:21.463 --> 00:33:23.043
that are involved--
<v Regina>Fabulous.</v>

699
00:33:23.043 --> 00:33:25.143
that community supported agriculture program.

700
00:33:25.143 --> 00:33:29.883
And then there was years ago, as part of this kind of

701
00:33:29.883 --> 00:33:32.262
consciousness raising around food,

702
00:33:32.262 --> 00:33:34.483
there was some connections made regarding doing

703
00:33:34.483 --> 00:33:38.302
a public farmers market downtown Reno.

704
00:33:38.302 --> 00:33:41.763
And it's now called the West Street Market,

705
00:33:41.763 --> 00:33:44.360
and that actually involves,

706
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.101
there's a lot of stakeholders in that.

707
00:33:46.101 --> 00:33:49.401
But the seeds of that idea came just by connecting people

708
00:33:49.401 --> 00:33:53.340
years ago in the city structure because the city of Reno

709
00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.460
has invested some money into it,

710
00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.641
as well as other stakeholders.

711
00:33:57.641 --> 00:34:00.960
And our local environmental network has moved in

712
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.821
to the space there,

713
00:34:02.821 --> 00:34:06.159
and they have continual consciousness raising.

714
00:34:06.159 --> 00:34:07.239
<v Regina>Wonderful.</v>

715
00:34:07.239 --> 00:34:10.359
<v ->So the Local Food System group meets monthly,</v>

716
00:34:10.359 --> 00:34:13.959
and they're just really excited, so they're just building

717
00:34:13.959 --> 00:34:15.378
that kind of network.

718
00:34:15.378 --> 00:34:18.399
So we were just a catalyst, and let it go.

719
00:34:18.399 --> 00:34:22.999
So we've kind of developed this idea of building blocks,

720
00:34:22.999 --> 00:34:26.299
and local economy is one, local food is another.

721
00:34:26.299 --> 00:34:30.219
Healthy families and communities, like family community

722
00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:31.399
health and wellness.

723
00:34:31.399 --> 00:34:33.379
So these are all, and then neighbors getting

724
00:34:33.379 --> 00:34:35.039
to know neighbors.

725
00:34:35.039 --> 00:34:38.199
So these are building blocks or basic needs

726
00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:39.739
of every community.

727
00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:41.998
In fact, this could be universal.

728
00:34:41.998 --> 00:34:43.479
These are basic needs that are universal,

729
00:34:43.479 --> 00:34:45.322
and some of those I learned from Sarvodaya.

730
00:34:45.322 --> 00:34:47.663
They have 10 basic needs for a village,

731
00:34:47.663 --> 00:34:49.082
and how a village could develop.

732
00:34:49.082 --> 00:34:51.182
So some of these ideas that we use,

733
00:34:51.182 --> 00:34:55.142
we call them building blocks, and we created a concept

734
00:34:55.142 --> 00:34:57.222
that we call a community ark.

735
00:34:57.222 --> 00:34:59.962
So an ark is kind of, I guess it may sound biblical,

736
00:34:59.962 --> 00:35:02.582
and I guess it is in a sense that, you know,

737
00:35:02.582 --> 00:35:06.962
back in the Bible about the fact that humans weren't

738
00:35:06.962 --> 00:35:10.862
doing very well on the planet, and I guess God told Noah

739
00:35:10.862 --> 00:35:15.022
that he better prepare for this big deluge that's going to

740
00:35:15.022 --> 00:35:17.142
cleanse everything so we could start again.

741
00:35:17.142 --> 00:35:20.462
Well, not to get so extreme, but what we're looking at is

742
00:35:20.462 --> 00:35:23.663
with the breakdown of infrastructure, like the credit system

743
00:35:23.663 --> 00:35:27.002
and the mortgage system and the petroleum-based

744
00:35:27.002 --> 00:35:28.582
energy system--
<v Regina>Political.</v>

745
00:35:28.582 --> 00:35:32.622
Yes, it's forcing us back into our local communities.

746
00:35:32.622 --> 00:35:35.862
In other words, we're kind of stripping away all this

747
00:35:35.862 --> 00:35:40.862
global idea, which is good to develop global markets

748
00:35:41.822 --> 00:35:43.842
and those kinds of things, but if it's not based on

749
00:35:43.842 --> 00:35:46.942
a sound foundation, which we believe there's spiritual

750
00:35:46.942 --> 00:35:49.922
aspects to it, social aspects and economic aspects,

751
00:35:49.922 --> 00:35:53.622
and it has to do with local community self reliance

752
00:35:53.622 --> 00:35:58.382
and self support, and a different vision than exists in

753
00:35:58.382 --> 00:36:01.662
our whole overall global society now that's

754
00:36:01.662 --> 00:36:03.282
very materialistic.

755
00:36:03.282 --> 00:36:07.002
So this community ark idea has to do with building

756
00:36:07.002 --> 00:36:09.862
an infrastructure so that we can take care of each other

757
00:36:09.862 --> 00:36:11.562
and support one another.

758
00:36:11.562 --> 00:36:15.042
So while right now with what's happening with the

759
00:36:15.042 --> 00:36:18.003
global economy, specifically the American economy with

760
00:36:18.003 --> 00:36:20.702
housing and the credit crunch and all these things,

761
00:36:20.702 --> 00:36:23.362
is that people are actually seeing that it's important

762
00:36:23.362 --> 00:36:24.922
to get to know your neighbor.

763
00:36:24.922 --> 00:36:28.202
<v Regina>Yes, and talk about this, it's a monthly program?</v>

764
00:36:28.202 --> 00:36:30.242
<v ->Well you know, it started, you mean Get to</v>

765
00:36:30.242 --> 00:36:31.342
Know Your Neighbor?
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

766
00:36:31.342 --> 00:36:34.133
<v ->It was an annual event that emerged,</v>

767
00:36:34.133 --> 00:36:37.342
this is another kind of emerging event,

768
00:36:37.342 --> 00:36:41.142
one of the few annual events that we do.

769
00:36:41.142 --> 00:36:44.962
This event started three years ago, and it was called

770
00:36:44.962 --> 00:36:46.742
Get to Know Your Neighbor Day, and now it's called

771
00:36:46.742 --> 00:36:49.562
Get to Know Your Neighbor Week, and it's in June.

772
00:36:49.562 --> 00:36:54.302
And it simply started where we asked people to do

773
00:36:54.302 --> 00:36:58.202
a gathering, like a potluck or a barbecue, in their home or

774
00:36:58.202 --> 00:37:02.222
in their front yard or on their street, like a block party.

775
00:37:02.222 --> 00:37:04.322
And the first year without any publicity we had like

776
00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:06.462
50 simultaneous gatherings.

777
00:37:06.462 --> 00:37:07.222
<v Regina>Wow.</v>

778
00:37:07.222 --> 00:37:09.962
<v ->So 50 people stood up and they said, you know,</v>

779
00:37:09.962 --> 00:37:12.162
I don't really know my neighbors very well.

780
00:37:12.162 --> 00:37:14.643
Or I know them, but I wanna reconnect and

781
00:37:14.643 --> 00:37:16.242
strengthen the bonds.

782
00:37:16.242 --> 00:37:18.982
So they went door to door, each individual person,

783
00:37:18.982 --> 00:37:21.123
and did these simultaneous gatherings with

784
00:37:21.123 --> 00:37:22.522
thousands of people.

785
00:37:22.522 --> 00:37:25.182
And then this last year it's probably up to 100 gatherings.

786
00:37:25.182 --> 00:37:29.602
And what's unique this year I feel is that it's not just

787
00:37:29.602 --> 00:37:30.882
an annual event.

788
00:37:30.882 --> 00:37:34.922
Many people throughout our community actually are

789
00:37:34.922 --> 00:37:36.263
doing this year round.

790
00:37:36.263 --> 00:37:37.942
That is, they actually are forming what we call

791
00:37:37.942 --> 00:37:39.462
caring circles.

792
00:37:39.462 --> 00:37:42.003
So on a given street, the person who steps up

793
00:37:42.003 --> 00:37:45.342
and does this potluck, they find a way to communicate

794
00:37:45.342 --> 00:37:47.542
with their neighbors through email lists,

795
00:37:47.542 --> 00:37:50.962
they get their phone numbers, they do skills sharing.

796
00:37:50.962 --> 00:37:52.662
You know, what do you need?

797
00:37:52.662 --> 00:37:53.822
What do I have?

798
00:37:53.822 --> 00:37:56.202
And then people start taking care of basic needs.

799
00:37:56.202 --> 00:38:00.223
You can think about it, of all the world's problems,

800
00:38:00.223 --> 00:38:04.202
many of them exist on any given street in the world.

801
00:38:04.202 --> 00:38:08.282
Hunger, alienation, poverty, homeless.

802
00:38:08.282 --> 00:38:10.922
I mean, all these things exist on any given street.

803
00:38:10.922 --> 00:38:14.712
So we kind of suggested to people, 'cause many people

804
00:38:14.712 --> 00:38:17.742
that are activists tend to think globally or nationally,

805
00:38:17.742 --> 00:38:22.463
but for whatever reason this year, in 2008, many people are

806
00:38:22.463 --> 00:38:25.022
seeing the need, especially like environmentalists and

807
00:38:25.022 --> 00:38:27.242
others that are concerned about ecological footprints

808
00:38:27.242 --> 00:38:30.503
and that kind of thing, they're seeing the need to really

809
00:38:30.503 --> 00:38:31.842
make this grass roots,

810
00:38:31.842 --> 00:38:34.522
so they're actually organizing their streets.

811
00:38:34.522 --> 00:38:37.342
Like they're planting gardens, they're growing food,

812
00:38:37.342 --> 00:38:39.242
they're sharing skills with one another.

813
00:38:39.242 --> 00:38:42.402
Seniors who were alone are identified just because people

814
00:38:42.402 --> 00:38:44.562
get to know that, hey gosh, there's somebody that's

815
00:38:44.562 --> 00:38:47.083
alone there, maybe they need some support.

816
00:38:47.083 --> 00:38:50.402
So they actually connect a family to a senior who's alone,

817
00:38:50.402 --> 00:38:55.402
or single moms who really didn't know each other,

818
00:38:56.202 --> 00:38:58.382
they form a bond because they can help each other

819
00:38:58.382 --> 00:38:59.962
with their children.

820
00:38:59.962 --> 00:39:04.383
And I've actually, over the years I've done this myself,

821
00:39:04.383 --> 00:39:08.762
as being a single dad raising a 13-year-old boy, you know,

822
00:39:08.762 --> 00:39:12.162
a lot of my neighbors here get to know their friends,

823
00:39:12.162 --> 00:39:13.602
and then we help each other.

824
00:39:13.602 --> 00:39:14.842
So it's a natural process.

825
00:39:14.842 --> 00:39:18.102
So what we're doing is, again we're a catalyst for an

826
00:39:18.102 --> 00:39:21.262
emerging natural process that's been kind of overshadowed

827
00:39:21.262 --> 00:39:23.963
by people focusing on the powers that be to

828
00:39:23.963 --> 00:39:25.202
take care of our lives.

829
00:39:25.202 --> 00:39:27.042
We're gonna wait til the government does something.

830
00:39:27.042 --> 00:39:29.342
Or we're gonna wait til the social service agency

831
00:39:29.342 --> 00:39:31.582
does something, or the business community,

832
00:39:31.582 --> 00:39:33.062
or the corporations.

833
00:39:33.062 --> 00:39:35.342
Well you know, right now the consciousness is shifting,

834
00:39:35.342 --> 00:39:36.822
and people are realizing that we must take

835
00:39:36.822 --> 00:39:38.223
care of ourselves.

836
00:39:38.223 --> 00:39:39.362
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

837
00:39:39.362 --> 00:39:41.082
<v ->So that's what's happening, and it's real exciting</v>

838
00:39:41.082 --> 00:39:44.422
because it's going, and so now we're building leadership

839
00:39:44.422 --> 00:39:47.762
amongst the folks that have stepped up on the streets,

840
00:39:47.762 --> 00:39:51.802
and to support them so that they get together,

841
00:39:51.802 --> 00:39:54.582
and that they continue this process of training others

842
00:39:54.582 --> 00:39:56.222
to do the same.

843
00:39:56.222 --> 00:39:59.922
So imagine, like in our town imagine hundreds of thousands

844
00:39:59.922 --> 00:40:02.522
of streets where there are people who are coming from

845
00:40:02.522 --> 00:40:05.122
a higher spiritual consciousness of love and

846
00:40:05.122 --> 00:40:06.342
wanting to be of service.

847
00:40:06.342 --> 00:40:10.582
Imagine them witnessing to that by their beingness,

848
00:40:10.582 --> 00:40:12.022
their nature.

849
00:40:12.022 --> 00:40:16.782
It's not flashy, it's not a teaching, it's not an agenda.

850
00:40:16.782 --> 00:40:19.762
The agenda is just being open hearted and to be

851
00:40:19.762 --> 00:40:21.702
of service and available.

852
00:40:22.242 --> 00:40:24.462
So you're not trying to push anything except just

853
00:40:24.462 --> 00:40:26.782
being available, being open.

854
00:40:26.782 --> 00:40:29.702
<v Regina>And you have these meetings that I think</v>

855
00:40:29.702 --> 00:40:31.242
you told me were once a week.

856
00:40:31.242 --> 00:40:32.943
Is it once a week or once a month,

857
00:40:32.943 --> 00:40:35.062
the community weavers group?

858
00:40:35.062 --> 00:40:37.563
<v ->Well, would you like me to share the origin</v>

859
00:40:37.563 --> 00:40:39.082
of that group briefly?
<v Regina>Yes, I would.</v>

860
00:40:39.082 --> 00:40:42.512
And share what you do, and that this is actually fulfilling

861
00:40:42.512 --> 00:40:45.422
the spiritual element of the consciousness.

862
00:40:45.422 --> 00:40:47.902
<v ->You know, that's true because we have these three pillars,</v>

863
00:40:47.902 --> 00:40:49.682
the social, economic and spiritual.

864
00:40:49.682 --> 00:40:51.982
And we've been developing a social infrastructure

865
00:40:51.982 --> 00:40:54.542
and an economic infrastructure in the beginning.

866
00:40:54.542 --> 00:40:58.022
Then question is, in America where we have so many

867
00:40:58.022 --> 00:41:00.422
different belief systems, religious and spiritual

868
00:41:00.422 --> 00:41:04.423
belief systems, how is it possible to get people together?

869
00:41:04.423 --> 00:41:08.743
Because historically it just seems to lead to conflict

870
00:41:08.743 --> 00:41:11.482
and war and bloodshed, you know, arguing about

871
00:41:11.482 --> 00:41:12.942
different belief systems.

872
00:41:12.942 --> 00:41:14.522
Who's right, who's better?

873
00:41:14.522 --> 00:41:18.502
So we decided, even though a lot of people were kind of

874
00:41:18.502 --> 00:41:21.562
unsure about doing this, like how do we open,

875
00:41:21.562 --> 00:41:24.852
how do we have a conversation about spirituality without it

876
00:41:24.852 --> 00:41:27.023
generating a barroom brawl?
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

877
00:41:27.023 --> 00:41:28.603
<v ->You know, how do you do that?</v>

878
00:41:28.603 --> 00:41:32.783
So we called a meeting in '06, and it was on Valentine's Day

879
00:41:32.783 --> 00:41:34.063
so it was kinda cool--
<v Regina>Wonderful.</v>

880
00:41:34.063 --> 00:41:35.663
because it gave us an excuse to talk about love.

881
00:41:35.663 --> 00:41:36.603
<v Regina>Love, yeah.</v>

882
00:41:36.603 --> 00:41:38.623
<v ->So we took it higher, we took live higher beyond</v>

883
00:41:38.623 --> 00:41:41.223
just romantic love and we focused on what in the

884
00:41:41.223 --> 00:41:45.423
Christian tradition is agape, or the unconditional love.

885
00:41:45.423 --> 00:41:49.003
And we brought individuals and community leaders,

886
00:41:49.003 --> 00:41:52.403
so we had like 15 religious leaders actually from

887
00:41:52.403 --> 00:41:56.783
different faiths, Muslim, Christian, Jewish.

888
00:41:56.783 --> 00:41:59.183
There were Buddhists, there were the kind of new

889
00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:01.743
spirituality groups that were there as well.

890
00:42:01.743 --> 00:42:03.664
Then we had business leaders, we had leaders of

891
00:42:03.664 --> 00:42:05.923
social service agencies, and the general public.

892
00:42:05.923 --> 00:42:08.403
We had about 100 people, and again we did the same format.

893
00:42:08.403 --> 00:42:11.783
We broke down into small groups, and we asked the people

894
00:42:11.783 --> 00:42:15.344
a series of questions, and one of the main questions was

895
00:42:15.344 --> 00:42:17.643
what do you think the main problem facing

896
00:42:17.643 --> 00:42:19.943
American society is?

897
00:42:19.943 --> 00:42:24.943
And the answer really overwhelmingly was lack of unity.

898
00:42:26.303 --> 00:42:27.843
Lack of unity.

899
00:42:27.843 --> 00:42:30.483
So then we then led a brainstorm of

900
00:42:30.483 --> 00:42:33.663
OK, let's list all sorts of things that we could do

901
00:42:33.663 --> 00:42:35.263
to build unity.

902
00:42:35.263 --> 00:42:38.663
So out of this process came 150 ideas,

903
00:42:38.663 --> 00:42:41.784
and one of them became Get to Know Your Neighbor Week.

904
00:42:41.784 --> 00:42:44.703
So that idea emerged from this group process.

905
00:42:44.703 --> 00:42:46.983
It wasn't like we read about it in a book, or you know,

906
00:42:46.983 --> 00:42:48.823
we went on the internet and we found there was some model

907
00:42:48.823 --> 00:42:50.383
and we're just gonna replicate it.

908
00:42:50.383 --> 00:42:52.384
This was working on us.

909
00:42:52.384 --> 00:42:57.384
This process, if you're able to let this group process go

910
00:42:57.963 --> 00:43:01.343
and not try to control it, if you just allow it to emerge,

911
00:43:01.343 --> 00:43:03.303
which is one of the important principles of building

912
00:43:03.303 --> 00:43:06.164
community is to be more like a steward.

913
00:43:06.164 --> 00:43:06.823
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

914
00:43:06.823 --> 00:43:08.363
<v ->It's like being loving, you know.</v>

915
00:43:08.363 --> 00:43:11.484
It's like being gentle and humble, as opposed to

916
00:43:11.484 --> 00:43:14.423
I know what's best, and we're gonna do it this way,

917
00:43:14.423 --> 00:43:16.623
'cause then you're just gonna generate animosity,

918
00:43:16.623 --> 00:43:18.763
and the kind of group you're gonna develop is gonna be

919
00:43:18.763 --> 00:43:20.103
ego-based and territorial.

920
00:43:20.103 --> 00:43:21.623
<v Regina>Yeah, more separation.</v>

921
00:43:21.623 --> 00:43:23.203
<v ->So we learned through this process,</v>

922
00:43:23.203 --> 00:43:24.343
so that was one example.

923
00:43:24.343 --> 00:43:26.543
Another was we did an annual celebration,

924
00:43:26.543 --> 00:43:30.144
so we had a festival and a sustainable community expo

925
00:43:30.144 --> 00:43:32.003
that we've done for the last two years.

926
00:43:32.003 --> 00:43:33.523
That was another example.

927
00:43:33.523 --> 00:43:37.484
And the third idea that came up was what

928
00:43:37.484 --> 00:43:39.203
we initially called teams.

929
00:43:39.203 --> 00:43:43.323
So the idea was we were gonna build teams of people

930
00:43:43.323 --> 00:43:47.003
to discuss what we have in common about spirituality.

931
00:43:47.003 --> 00:43:50.283
So the way that we've defined the context for spirituality

932
00:43:50.283 --> 00:43:53.824
is to focus on virtues that we share, that are in common to

933
00:43:53.824 --> 00:43:56.113
all the moral and ethical...

934
00:43:58.683 --> 00:44:00.883
systems of all the world's religions,

935
00:44:00.883 --> 00:44:03.873
but also in common to what's happening in the civic

936
00:44:03.873 --> 00:44:05.693
secular society.

937
00:44:06.513 --> 00:44:09.583
And so we identified five categories of virtues,

938
00:44:09.583 --> 00:44:11.304
and about 30 total virtues.

939
00:44:11.304 --> 00:44:15.543
So we identified love, integrity, courage,

940
00:44:15.543 --> 00:44:17.083
service and respect.

941
00:44:17.083 --> 00:44:19.524
And within those are things like forgiveness

942
00:44:19.524 --> 00:44:22.123
and faith and hope and...

943
00:44:22.123 --> 00:44:23.823
<v Regina>Compassion.</v>
<v ->Compassion.</v>

944
00:44:23.823 --> 00:44:28.263
Forgiveness and self reliance and restraint

945
00:44:28.263 --> 00:44:30.443
and service and building community,

946
00:44:30.443 --> 00:44:32.103
all those kinds of things were in there.

947
00:44:32.103 --> 00:44:35.963
So this group of people, we had an experiment, if you will,

948
00:44:35.963 --> 00:44:38.123
so it was a group process.

949
00:44:38.123 --> 00:44:39.723
Again, we didn't know anything about it.

950
00:44:39.723 --> 00:44:41.503
We didn't read about it in a book, you know.

951
00:44:41.503 --> 00:44:43.683
We didn't like find it online somewhere.

952
00:44:43.683 --> 00:44:46.463
We didn't like just take some canned program.

953
00:44:46.463 --> 00:44:50.024
We were really wanting to learn what is a way for people

954
00:44:50.024 --> 00:44:54.563
to get together to raise spiritual awareness,

955
00:44:54.563 --> 00:44:58.143
but not in a context of any particular religious system

956
00:44:58.143 --> 00:44:59.543
or spiritual teaching.

957
00:44:59.543 --> 00:45:02.243
So it's not based on going to a workshop or a conference

958
00:45:02.243 --> 00:45:04.683
or listening to a sermon by somebody.

959
00:45:04.683 --> 00:45:07.063
How could people get together and help one another?

960
00:45:07.063 --> 00:45:10.203
So over the last two years we've been building what now

961
00:45:10.203 --> 00:45:14.063
we call the Conscious Community Weavers Group,

962
00:45:14.063 --> 00:45:15.723
and they meet once a month.

963
00:45:15.723 --> 00:45:19.663
And it's a very amazing process, and I have to say

964
00:45:19.663 --> 00:45:22.864
since I've been involved and maybe actively more than

965
00:45:22.864 --> 00:45:25.823
25 years of maybe conscious spiritual practice of

966
00:45:25.823 --> 00:45:30.043
different kinds, I'm just amazed at myself because

967
00:45:30.043 --> 00:45:34.443
I'm constantly, it's a humbling experience, you know,

968
00:45:34.443 --> 00:45:37.023
when you think you know something or you think that

969
00:45:37.023 --> 00:45:39.644
your view is better or something, there's this kind of

970
00:45:39.644 --> 00:45:42.723
spiritual superiority that kind of develops

971
00:45:42.723 --> 00:45:44.523
in any spiritual practice,

972
00:45:44.523 --> 00:45:47.043
whether it's within organized relation or the new

973
00:45:47.043 --> 00:45:49.343
spiritual traditions that are developing,

974
00:45:49.343 --> 00:45:51.003
there's this kind of superiority that develops.

975
00:45:51.003 --> 00:45:54.444
And this, it really levels it because the idea isn't to

976
00:45:54.444 --> 00:45:55.943
talk about beliefs.

977
00:45:55.943 --> 00:45:58.223
The idea is to talk about how we're demonstrating

978
00:45:58.223 --> 00:46:01.483
our highest spiritual principles and ideals.

979
00:46:01.483 --> 00:46:03.603
So people come into the group from different spiritual

980
00:46:03.603 --> 00:46:05.044
and religious backgrounds.

981
00:46:05.044 --> 00:46:07.843
So we have Christians and Jews, and we have people

982
00:46:07.843 --> 00:46:11.983
maybe are spiritual but not religious, so we have a mix.

983
00:46:11.983 --> 00:46:13.643
And it's very simple.

984
00:46:13.643 --> 00:46:17.663
We ask people to share directly from their heart

985
00:46:17.663 --> 00:46:22.663
in simple language how they are overcoming and

986
00:46:23.983 --> 00:46:28.983
transcending the way the ego is dominating our lives

987
00:46:29.143 --> 00:46:31.703
in a way that leads to suffering.

988
00:46:31.703 --> 00:46:34.893
And the way that we do that is people share

989
00:46:34.893 --> 00:46:36.863
virtues that they're demonstrating.

990
00:46:36.863 --> 00:46:38.643
So the virtues are like a handle.

991
00:46:38.643 --> 00:46:39.903
<v Regina>Give us an example of something</v>

992
00:46:39.903 --> 00:46:42.083
that you found fascinating and you learned from.

993
00:46:42.083 --> 00:46:45.203
<v ->Well, for myself personally, I mean, it's just so.</v>

994
00:46:45.203 --> 00:46:47.983
I mean, I could tell amazing stories like I'll just

995
00:46:47.983 --> 00:46:49.263
share one or two.

996
00:46:49.263 --> 00:46:54.263
One is I had to admit to myself that I had

997
00:46:55.003 --> 00:46:58.983
unforgiveness for my mother, who's in her 80s.

998
00:46:58.983 --> 00:47:01.284
And I just wasn't aware of it.

999
00:47:01.284 --> 00:47:06.284
She was going to visit Reno from where they live, and...

1000
00:47:07.964 --> 00:47:10.544
I made it as an intention in this group.

1001
00:47:10.544 --> 00:47:13.404
I said, you know, I'm gonna forgive my mother.

1002
00:47:13.404 --> 00:47:15.004
I don't know how I'm gonna do it.

1003
00:47:15.004 --> 00:47:19.073
So I didn't really get into my own personal spiritual

1004
00:47:19.073 --> 00:47:22.704
practice which has to do with I guess following Jesus.

1005
00:47:22.704 --> 00:47:25.164
But I guess I'm not part of an organized religion,

1006
00:47:25.164 --> 00:47:28.383
but I look at Jesus more as like an elder brother.

1007
00:47:28.383 --> 00:47:31.403
<v Regina>Yes, yes, a guiding force, guiding light.</v>

1008
00:47:31.403 --> 00:47:36.403
<v ->So I asked for me, I pray to God and I ask Jesus,</v>

1009
00:47:37.004 --> 00:47:38.544
help me, please.

1010
00:47:38.544 --> 00:47:40.104
So this is part of the process.

1011
00:47:40.104 --> 00:47:43.203
Anyway, you know, in my meditation that I learned

1012
00:47:43.203 --> 00:47:46.844
from the Tibetans, but also in the prayer that I learned

1013
00:47:46.844 --> 00:47:51.654
through Christians that I know, I was able to...

1014
00:47:52.903 --> 00:47:57.323
create some openness within myself to create an opportunity

1015
00:47:57.323 --> 00:48:00.524
when my mother was visiting here once to

1016
00:48:00.524 --> 00:48:04.104
take her on a whole day of adventure, you know.

1017
00:48:04.104 --> 00:48:06.703
Take her to lunch and then go hiking in the forest,

1018
00:48:06.703 --> 00:48:11.483
and in the build up to that I had time to really

1019
00:48:11.483 --> 00:48:13.263
focus on myself.

1020
00:48:13.263 --> 00:48:18.263
And by seeing my mother I was able to put it into practice.

1021
00:48:18.263 --> 00:48:20.863
Well, I didn't quite accomplish what I wanted to

1022
00:48:20.863 --> 00:48:24.623
fully that time, but then I brought it back to the group

1023
00:48:24.623 --> 00:48:26.563
to share what I had accomplished.

1024
00:48:26.563 --> 00:48:28.044
I said this is what I did.

1025
00:48:28.044 --> 00:48:31.924
I was able to apply this principle, I prayed, I meditated,

1026
00:48:31.924 --> 00:48:34.604
I practiced, you know, as much as I could understand

1027
00:48:34.604 --> 00:48:37.063
forgiveness, and this is the outcome.

1028
00:48:37.063 --> 00:48:39.723
And then another month went by 'cause I had that

1029
00:48:39.723 --> 00:48:41.543
as an intention to continue this.

1030
00:48:41.543 --> 00:48:43.963
So within three months I really believed that I was

1031
00:48:43.963 --> 00:48:47.823
able to overcome the unforgiveness I had for my mother,

1032
00:48:47.823 --> 00:48:50.763
and it didn't involve her changing at all.

1033
00:48:50.763 --> 00:48:55.523
So I changed my perception, and then I was able to

1034
00:48:55.523 --> 00:48:58.063
see my mother in a different way and accept her

1035
00:48:58.063 --> 00:49:03.063
as she is, and that was, so I see this group as accelerating

1036
00:49:03.103 --> 00:49:05.183
that kind of transforming.

1037
00:49:05.183 --> 00:49:06.683
<v Regina>And this is really foundational 'cause</v>

1038
00:49:06.683 --> 00:49:10.083
this is part of creating a healthy interior world view,

1039
00:49:10.083 --> 00:49:15.083
and also relationships with others and family,

1040
00:49:15.584 --> 00:49:18.444
'cause this community is made up of families,

1041
00:49:18.444 --> 00:49:21.503
and this is really critical, just these very basic

1042
00:49:21.503 --> 00:49:23.583
sorts of things that every human being faces

1043
00:49:23.583 --> 00:49:25.243
to one degree or another.

1044
00:49:25.243 --> 00:49:26.703
<v ->You're absolutely right.</v>

1045
00:49:26.703 --> 00:49:29.203
We've taken, it's like all the stuff we were talking about,

1046
00:49:29.203 --> 00:49:32.023
the economic level, the social level, all these networks,

1047
00:49:32.023 --> 00:49:35.163
and we've just distilled it down to the simplest essence,

1048
00:49:35.163 --> 00:49:38.743
which is you could summarize I think all of religion

1049
00:49:38.743 --> 00:49:43.743
and all of spirituality into love and service to others.

1050
00:49:43.783 --> 00:49:46.163
So the love, people have different ideas of

1051
00:49:46.163 --> 00:49:47.703
how to get there.

1052
00:49:47.703 --> 00:49:52.603
You know, for myself I guess loving God,

1053
00:49:52.603 --> 00:49:56.763
or really allowing time to simplify my life so I could

1054
00:49:56.763 --> 00:49:59.544
develop my interior life so I can communicate

1055
00:49:59.544 --> 00:50:01.123
and have a relationship to God.

1056
00:50:01.123 --> 00:50:03.563
So there's something bigger than me that I'm part of,

1057
00:50:03.563 --> 00:50:06.803
but doing that creates a kind of an emptying,

1058
00:50:06.803 --> 00:50:09.163
it's an emptying process of the self.

1059
00:50:09.163 --> 00:50:12.383
So if you fill yourself with all this stuff and distractions

1060
00:50:12.383 --> 00:50:15.643
and worries and fears, that's all you can manifest

1061
00:50:15.643 --> 00:50:17.203
in this world.

1062
00:50:17.203 --> 00:50:20.963
But if you can start emptying the self, then what you allow

1063
00:50:20.963 --> 00:50:25.843
is through prayer, in my case, asking Jesus for help,

1064
00:50:25.843 --> 00:50:28.484
God's love comes through you if you let it,

1065
00:50:28.484 --> 00:50:32.423
and then it manifests as loving service.

1066
00:50:32.423 --> 00:50:33.583
It's action.

1067
00:50:33.583 --> 00:50:35.063
It's not something you keep to yourself.

1068
00:50:35.063 --> 00:50:38.343
It's not something that you're just gonna stay in a,

1069
00:50:38.343 --> 00:50:40.623
in your own little cave or something.

1070
00:50:40.623 --> 00:50:41.303
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1071
00:50:41.303 --> 00:50:42.563
<v ->So you start with your family.</v>

1072
00:50:42.563 --> 00:50:44.683
You're right, so you start at the basis.

1073
00:50:44.683 --> 00:50:48.423
There are so many people that are activists out there

1074
00:50:48.423 --> 00:50:51.004
that are trying to change the world and do good,

1075
00:50:51.004 --> 00:50:54.723
but on some level it's not complete if you just

1076
00:50:54.723 --> 00:50:57.923
ignore the family, and on the one hand go out and preach

1077
00:50:57.923 --> 00:51:02.543
peace and love in the world, but you hate your family,

1078
00:51:02.543 --> 00:51:03.903
or you ignore them.

1079
00:51:03.903 --> 00:51:05.343
<v Regina>Change begins at home.</v>

1080
00:51:05.343 --> 00:51:06.944
<v ->Well yeah, and you know, this is hard.</v>

1081
00:51:06.944 --> 00:51:08.824
I'm not saying this is easy at all,

1082
00:51:08.824 --> 00:51:12.064
but I think it's necessary today because we've just taken

1083
00:51:12.064 --> 00:51:16.904
this basic I guess insanity within ourselves,

1084
00:51:16.904 --> 00:51:20.764
and it's just over, you know, the last couple centuries

1085
00:51:20.764 --> 00:51:23.804
it's just magnified now, and it's global insanity.

1086
00:51:23.804 --> 00:51:26.024
So the way to take it back is to be very simple

1087
00:51:26.024 --> 00:51:28.924
and to start within, and in the family.

1088
00:51:28.924 --> 00:51:31.004
And then what we've done in this weaver group is we've

1089
00:51:31.004 --> 00:51:34.284
gone beyond just the individual and our families that

1090
00:51:34.284 --> 00:51:35.964
we're trying to support.

1091
00:51:35.964 --> 00:51:38.824
We have ways of reaching out to our neighbors

1092
00:51:38.824 --> 00:51:40.944
and then our whole community by connecting

1093
00:51:40.944 --> 00:51:43.284
existing projects.

1094
00:51:43.284 --> 00:51:46.504
So this weaver group isn't just for our own self awareness

1095
00:51:46.504 --> 00:51:47.964
and spiritual awareness.

1096
00:51:47.964 --> 00:51:51.164
It's actually connect the community to create opportunities

1097
00:51:51.164 --> 00:51:54.965
for new projects to be created outside of our group.

1098
00:51:54.965 --> 00:51:56.865
So we're not trying to organize these ourselves.

1099
00:51:56.865 --> 00:52:00.744
We're a catalysts, so we're an ongoing catalytic process.

1100
00:52:00.744 --> 00:52:03.164
<v Regina>Well, this is a message that I think</v>

1101
00:52:03.164 --> 00:52:07.204
every community needs to address in their own way.

1102
00:52:07.204 --> 00:52:11.884
Ultimately we're, as you say, we're now coming down to

1103
00:52:11.884 --> 00:52:14.684
paying the piper, and it means we do have to

1104
00:52:14.684 --> 00:52:16.564
rely on ourselves.

1105
00:52:16.564 --> 00:52:19.565
And the fact that you started this so many years ago,

1106
00:52:19.565 --> 00:52:22.524
and you're so far into this process now just when people

1107
00:52:22.524 --> 00:52:25.644
are starting to, en masse, starting to wake up and realize,

1108
00:52:25.644 --> 00:52:28.564
oh my goodness, all the institutions have failed us.

1109
00:52:28.564 --> 00:52:29.824
Now what do we do?

1110
00:52:29.824 --> 00:52:32.184
And it sounds like you've already made some really good

1111
00:52:32.184 --> 00:52:33.764
headway and can serve as a guide,

1112
00:52:33.764 --> 00:52:35.885
if you don't mind other people cutting and pasting

1113
00:52:35.885 --> 00:52:37.784
some of what you've done and applying it in

1114
00:52:37.784 --> 00:52:39.064
their own communities.

1115
00:52:39.064 --> 00:52:42.564
Not to say that one shouldn't have their own creative input

1116
00:52:42.564 --> 00:52:44.264
as to how this happens.

1117
00:52:44.264 --> 00:52:49.264
But on that note, before we go, a couple of just

1118
00:52:50.294 --> 00:52:52.795
salient points you'd like to make, some words of wisdom

1119
00:52:52.795 --> 00:52:56.075
as someone else hears this and inspired to take this on

1120
00:52:56.075 --> 00:52:58.775
themselves and plant seeds in their own community.

1121
00:52:58.775 --> 00:53:00.815
<v ->Sure, I'd like to do that.</v>

1122
00:53:00.815 --> 00:53:03.555
You know, before I'd say maybe a year or two ago

1123
00:53:03.555 --> 00:53:05.635
what we erre doing seemed complex 'cause we had

1124
00:53:05.635 --> 00:53:06.993
all these activities.

1125
00:53:06.993 --> 00:53:08.573
Now it's extremely simple.

1126
00:53:08.573 --> 00:53:13.573
What I would suggest is find, if you've got a friend,

1127
00:53:13.753 --> 00:53:16.253
get some friends together and your family,

1128
00:53:16.253 --> 00:53:19.233
maybe go to our website and look 'cause we actually have

1129
00:53:19.233 --> 00:53:22.273
this group process, it's kind of mapped out there.

1130
00:53:22.273 --> 00:53:27.173
And you can look at that as a way to start this process.

1131
00:53:27.173 --> 00:53:30.093
There are already millions of small groups that are

1132
00:53:30.093 --> 00:53:32.913
gathering because what we're trying to do is not

1133
00:53:32.913 --> 00:53:35.013
reinvent the wheel, but we're trying to create,

1134
00:53:35.013 --> 00:53:40.013
the group itself purpose is trying to connect the community.

1135
00:53:40.093 --> 00:53:42.034
So it's kind of a unique function I think.

1136
00:53:42.034 --> 00:53:45.193
So it's not, we're not like creating anything new

1137
00:53:45.193 --> 00:53:48.633
for ourselves, like building up your own organization,

1138
00:53:48.633 --> 00:53:50.633
so that's not the interest.

1139
00:53:50.633 --> 00:53:52.333
<v Regina>You're creating almost conscious awareness</v>

1140
00:53:52.333 --> 00:53:55.233
of each other and what you can do to help become part of

1141
00:53:55.233 --> 00:53:56.593
and sustain the whole.

1142
00:53:56.593 --> 00:54:00.213
<v ->I think so, it's like creating like islands of sanity,</v>

1143
00:54:00.213 --> 00:54:05.213
and the sanity to me rests in connecting to something

1144
00:54:05.253 --> 00:54:06.893
greater than yourselves first,

1145
00:54:06.893 --> 00:54:09.054
so for me it's connecting to God.

1146
00:54:09.054 --> 00:54:13.554
And then being able to have that work through us

1147
00:54:13.554 --> 00:54:18.173
and actually create an island of joy starting with

1148
00:54:18.173 --> 00:54:21.233
small groups where we take care of one another.

1149
00:54:21.233 --> 00:54:24.593
So part of the group process isn't just like processing.

1150
00:54:24.593 --> 00:54:26.433
It's actually practical support.

1151
00:54:26.433 --> 00:54:29.073
We build a community where we help each other

1152
00:54:29.073 --> 00:54:31.413
with practical stuff like somebody needs to move

1153
00:54:31.413 --> 00:54:32.433
on a weekend.

1154
00:54:32.433 --> 00:54:34.013
You'll be right there, we're available.

1155
00:54:34.013 --> 00:54:37.653
So we're actually building the seeds of a new community.

1156
00:54:37.653 --> 00:54:41.873
And I think, so I call it, it's like an intentional

1157
00:54:41.873 --> 00:54:44.113
spiritual community without walls.

1158
00:54:44.113 --> 00:54:46.613
And there's no ideology.

1159
00:54:46.613 --> 00:54:51.013
There's just this intention to support one another

1160
00:54:51.013 --> 00:54:54.924
and to live a life based on love and service.

1161
00:54:56.283 --> 00:54:58.113
<v Regina>Thank you.</v>

1162
00:54:58.113 --> 00:54:59.543
<v ->You're welcome.</v>

1163
00:55:01.393 --> 00:55:03.954
<v ->Please take it upon yourself to contact Richard</v>

1164
00:55:03.954 --> 00:55:05.954
if you would like to create conscious community

1165
00:55:05.954 --> 00:55:07.174
in your area.

1166
00:55:07.174 --> 00:55:08.913
He's a very loving and generous soul,

1167
00:55:08.913 --> 00:55:10.473
and will be happy to help you understand

1168
00:55:10.473 --> 00:55:12.674
the dynamics of community building.

1169
00:55:12.674 --> 00:55:15.623
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
