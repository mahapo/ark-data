1
00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:03.148
<v ->Get ready to meet the kind of doctor</v>

2
00:00:03.148 --> 00:00:05.676
everyone in the world should have access to.

3
00:00:05.676 --> 00:00:07.041
A doctor that understands the value

4
00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:09.665
of keeping an open mind to any kind of healing

5
00:00:09.665 --> 00:00:10.945
that can help his patient,

6
00:00:10.945 --> 00:00:13.867
especially modalities that have no side effects.

7
00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:16.470
So respected is Dr. Dailey that he was voted

8
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.189
best physician in the country three years running

9
00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.600
by the Consumers Research Council.

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.648
And among the modalities of healing Dr. Dailey

11
00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:26.528
has used alongside standard allopathic practices,

12
00:00:26.528 --> 00:00:28.960
are Reikei; he's a third degree Master.

13
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.917
Crystal healing, sound, color,

14
00:00:30.917 --> 00:00:32.981
and remote healing practices.

15
00:00:32.981 --> 00:00:34.996
One of his favorite diagnostic tools

16
00:00:34.996 --> 00:00:39.295
is Harry Oldfield's PIP imaging system.

17
00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:44.295 line:15% 
(soothing music)

18
00:00:47.348 --> 00:00:49.097
I guess my question is what's right

19
00:00:49.097 --> 00:00:50.654
with this picture?

20
00:00:50.654 --> 00:00:53.182
I have never heard of a physician that uses

21
00:00:53.182 --> 00:00:56.126
so many fabulous modalities as yourself.

22
00:00:56.126 --> 00:00:58.638
Which, of course, has to be part of why you

23
00:00:58.638 --> 00:01:00.755
have been voted Physician of the Year

24
00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:03.144
three years in a row.

25
00:01:03.144 --> 00:01:04.211
Three years in a row?

26
00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:07.826
<v ->Well, I'm a believer in whatever floats your boat,</v>

27
00:01:07.826 --> 00:01:09.266
whatever works.

28
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.154
So I'm looking forward to the time

29
00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:12.658
we don't have traditional

30
00:01:12.658 --> 00:01:14.077
and complimentary medicine;

31
00:01:14.077 --> 00:01:16.381
it's therapies.

32
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:19.090
I'm open to whatever makes people feel better

33
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.391
and be well.

34
00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:22.972
And I'm a big believer in traditional medicine,

35
00:01:22.972 --> 00:01:25.543
surgeries, chemotherapies for cancer,

36
00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:27.137
that kind of thing.

37
00:01:27.137 --> 00:01:29.521
But I found that there are a lot of other

38
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:33.137
therapies that can be really beneficial and enhance

39
00:01:33.137 --> 00:01:36.507
some of the traditional therapies and also work in ways

40
00:01:36.507 --> 00:01:40.080
that traditional therapies may not be as effective.

41
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.734
<v ->And you really, when did you start</v>

42
00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:44.027
going into the, I mean you're obviously

43
00:01:44.027 --> 00:01:45.051
a medical doctor.

44
00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:45.584
<v ->Sure.</v>

45
00:01:45.584 --> 00:01:47.397
<v ->But when did you start going into what are still</v>

46
00:01:47.397 --> 00:01:49.808
called, if we have to polarize it a bit,

47
00:01:49.808 --> 00:01:51.184
the complimentary therapies?

48
00:01:51.184 --> 00:01:53.850
<v ->It's always been a part of my nature in life.</v>

49
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.338
My mother, who is a nurse, was a big believer

50
00:01:57.338 --> 00:01:58.885
in touch therapy.

51
00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:00.698
You know, if we'd fall and skin our knee,

52
00:02:00.698 --> 00:02:02.415
she'd rub it to make it better.

53
00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:05.252
And if it was really serious,

54
00:02:05.252 --> 00:02:06.852
she kissed it.

55
00:02:06.852 --> 00:02:07.523
<v ->Uh-huh.</v>

56
00:02:07.523 --> 00:02:09.497
<v ->To make the boo-boo go away, and it always worked.</v>

57
00:02:09.497 --> 00:02:12.590
And I just knew from a very early age that touch

58
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.817
could be healing.

59
00:02:13.817 --> 00:02:16.558
My father, interestingly, developed some of the

60
00:02:16.558 --> 00:02:21.315
early lasers and they needed very pure crystals,

61
00:02:21.315 --> 00:02:24.846
so at four years old we had a crystal lab in our basement,

62
00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:27.267
and I was growing alum and sulfur,

63
00:02:27.267 --> 00:02:30.168
and at eight years old, grew a gallium arsenide crystal,

64
00:02:30.168 --> 00:02:33.176
polished the ends, and built my first laser.

65
00:02:33.176 --> 00:02:37.308
And little did I know I'd be using those skills later

66
00:02:37.308 --> 00:02:38.967
working at a company called LaserSurge,

67
00:02:38.967 --> 00:02:41.986
developing surgical applications of lasers

68
00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:44.244
and then actually using the crystals

69
00:02:44.244 --> 00:02:45.740
themselves in healing.

70
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.641
<v ->What else could you become with a background like that?</v>

71
00:02:48.641 --> 00:02:49.783
<v ->Yes, yes. Sure.</v>

72
00:02:49.783 --> 00:02:50.807
<v ->It's a given.</v>

73
00:02:50.807 --> 00:02:54.380
And you use sound, you use color, you vibration,

74
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.630
you use crystals. You use -

75
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.590
<v ->Craniosacral.</v>

76
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.561
<v ->Craniosacral.</v>

77
00:02:58.561 --> 00:02:59.051
<v ->Yes.</v>

78
00:02:59.051 --> 00:02:59.841
<v ->You use all of it.</v>

79
00:02:59.841 --> 00:03:02.859
<v ->Reiki. Well, there's so many different ways.</v>

80
00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.609
I think you'll hear of vibrational medicine.

81
00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:08.544
If you look at a piano,

82
00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:10.421
it has 12 octaves.

83
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:13.717
If you go 12 octaves higher, it starts going

84
00:03:13.717 --> 00:03:17.184
faster and faster, a higher frequency.

85
00:03:17.184 --> 00:03:21.013
At that 12 octaves higher, you're now so fast,

86
00:03:21.013 --> 00:03:24.981
you're vibrating it the visible wavelengths of light.

87
00:03:24.981 --> 00:03:26.836
504 angstroms is blue light.

88
00:03:26.836 --> 00:03:30.719
So you might think of blue light as visible sound.

89
00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.065
You go higher yet, you get into

90
00:03:33.065 --> 00:03:34.879
radio waves, tv waves, while

91
00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.380
Reiki energies are several octaves lower.

92
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.281
And so you begin to appreciate how

93
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:45.299
if hit two, you know, a C note on the piano,

94
00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.528
the other Cs may vibrate in resonance

95
00:03:47.528 --> 00:03:51.614
that you could use your medications for depression

96
00:03:51.614 --> 00:03:53.640
but we know light, for instance,

97
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.475
in Seasonal Affective Disorder can improve

98
00:03:56.475 --> 00:03:58.237
depression in those people.

99
00:03:58.237 --> 00:04:00.552
Well, that's another frequency that's just up higher

100
00:04:00.552 --> 00:04:02.290
in the visible spectrum.

101
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.648
<v ->Mm-hm.</v>

102
00:04:02.648 --> 00:04:04.967
<v ->We know sound can have big influences.</v>

103
00:04:04.967 --> 00:04:08.498
The Mozart effect and such, so there's a lot of different

104
00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:11.026
ways to get therapeutic effects and a lot of them

105
00:04:11.026 --> 00:04:13.276
that have very little or no side effects

106
00:04:13.276 --> 00:04:14.876
or adverse effects.

107
00:04:14.876 --> 00:04:17.500
One of the other beauties of it.

108
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.825
<v ->You're working with Harry Oldfield</v>

109
00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:21.841
at this conference in tandem with each other.

110
00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:22.545
<v ->Yes.</v>

111
00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:24.838
<v ->Which brings another really interesting element</v>

112
00:04:24.838 --> 00:04:26.214
of work into this, doesn't it?

113
00:04:26.214 --> 00:04:28.209
<v ->It's a fantastic element.</v>

114
00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:30.416
Harry and I met about three years ago

115
00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:33.574
in Iceland, and I have been

116
00:04:33.574 --> 00:04:35.195
very interested in energy work,

117
00:04:35.195 --> 00:04:39.237
and I can perceive and visualize some energy fields,

118
00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:42.672
but it's - I've been looking for some kind of

119
00:04:42.672 --> 00:04:47.109
visual imaging system so we could learn about others

120
00:04:47.109 --> 00:04:49.967
and show other people, and I hadn't been

121
00:04:49.967 --> 00:04:53.636
very satisfied with the systems I'd been across.

122
00:04:53.636 --> 00:04:57.156
We were both at a conference called

123
00:04:57.156 --> 00:05:00.030
Heal the Healers in Iceland,

124
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.464
and Harry was there to demonstrate his

125
00:05:02.464 --> 00:05:05.166
what's called Polycontrast Interference Photography

126
00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:06.052
or PIP.

127
00:05:06.052 --> 00:05:06.723
<v ->PIP. Mm-hmm.</v>

128
00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:09.998
<v ->And I was intrigued immensely because it was</v>

129
00:05:09.998 --> 00:05:12.739
exactly what I'd been looking for,

130
00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:14.648
and I was actually doing the next lecture,

131
00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:16.430
and it was a healing demonstration,

132
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.331
and unbeknownst to me, he started imaging it.

133
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:22.349
And it confirmed a lot of the impressions I already had,

134
00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.048
and we got to talking and found out we had

135
00:05:25.048 --> 00:05:27.853
a lot of common interests in mind/body/medicine

136
00:05:27.853 --> 00:05:32.369
and such and started collaborating.

137
00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:35.227
I would go over to his clinic in London,

138
00:05:35.227 --> 00:05:37.356
he'd come over to the U.S. and it took us on a

139
00:05:37.356 --> 00:05:39.511
wide range of adventures.

140
00:05:39.511 --> 00:05:43.393
Initially primarily in the medical field and then

141
00:05:43.393 --> 00:05:44.684
farther beyond.

142
00:05:44.684 --> 00:05:47.222
<v ->Yeah, so you have quite an interesting background,</v>

143
00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:48.763
the two of you together.

144
00:05:48.763 --> 00:05:52.139
And I was lucky enough to be sitting in on

145
00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.435
one of the talks yesterday, workshops,

146
00:05:55.435 --> 00:05:57.430
and watch the two of you in the way in which

147
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.592
you work together.

148
00:05:58.592 --> 00:06:00.267
It's really interesting.

149
00:06:00.267 --> 00:06:02.869
Taking someone from the audience and in real time,

150
00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:05.610
his scanning device being able to watch their energy

151
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.928
and then even more, refine it through the filters

152
00:06:08.928 --> 00:06:11.199
to see what's going on in their bodies.

153
00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:15.455
And then watching you, as a Reiki Master,

154
00:06:15.455 --> 00:06:16.404
work with healing,

155
00:06:16.404 --> 00:06:18.954
and I think you also worked with crystal a time or two.

156
00:06:18.954 --> 00:06:20.906
Was it a Marcel Vogel crystal or? Yeah.

157
00:06:20.906 --> 00:06:23.625
<v ->Yes, a Marcel. Actually, we used several different kinds.</v>

158
00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:24.023
<v ->Yeah.</v>

159
00:06:24.023 --> 00:06:26.942
<v ->And for people again, you get into vibrational medicine.</v>

160
00:06:26.942 --> 00:06:29.470
Crystals have a frequency of vibration,

161
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.774
and it differs for each crystal.

162
00:06:31.774 --> 00:06:34.281
For instance, a quartz watch uses a quartz crystal

163
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:38.008
for timing because it vibrates at a precise frequency,

164
00:06:38.008 --> 00:06:39.912
and you can actually visualize the energy

165
00:06:39.912 --> 00:06:41.096
from the crystal.

166
00:06:41.096 --> 00:06:42.579
And we were showing some of that.

167
00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:45.949
And you can actually show that a healer using them

168
00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:47.730
can actually increase that energy

169
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:52.658
and interact with the patients to improve problems.

170
00:06:52.658 --> 00:06:53.607
<v ->That's the interesting thing.</v>

171
00:06:53.607 --> 00:06:56.423
The potential for diagnostics here seems to me to be

172
00:06:56.423 --> 00:06:59.804
one of the most profound aspects of this technology.

173
00:06:59.804 --> 00:07:02.407
And you, now do you know how to read it

174
00:07:02.407 --> 00:07:03.816
more or less as well as Harry does

175
00:07:03.816 --> 00:07:04.456
when you're looking

176
00:07:04.456 --> 00:07:05.724
at people now?

177
00:07:05.724 --> 00:07:07.024
<v ->Well, first you've got to,</v>

178
00:07:07.024 --> 00:07:08.596
Harry's a world-leading expert in this.

179
00:07:08.596 --> 00:07:09.016
<v ->Yes.</v>

180
00:07:09.016 --> 00:07:11.068
<v ->He developed it and has a number of years</v>

181
00:07:11.068 --> 00:07:13.926
of experience beyond mine.

182
00:07:13.926 --> 00:07:14.459
<v ->Right.</v>

183
00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:19.459
<v ->But I have been using it with private patients</v>

184
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.075
and finding it immensely helpful.

185
00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:25.531
It picks up, I mean besides the usual medical diagnoses,

186
00:07:25.531 --> 00:07:28.037
and I still rely on the traditional,

187
00:07:28.037 --> 00:07:29.755
if I'm concerned about liver tumors,

188
00:07:29.755 --> 00:07:31.525
I still get a CAT scan.

189
00:07:31.525 --> 00:07:33.989
But we have found it useful to sometimes

190
00:07:33.989 --> 00:07:35.983
pick up illnesses.

191
00:07:35.983 --> 00:07:39.599
He and I were doing a conference in Rochester, New York,

192
00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:41.722
and he picked up something in the right lung

193
00:07:41.722 --> 00:07:46.722
of a patient of actually an attendee in the conference,

194
00:07:47.108 --> 00:07:48.313
and suggested she get it checked out.

195
00:07:48.313 --> 00:07:50.426
Well, she was a smoker and thought it was

196
00:07:50.426 --> 00:07:52.398
lung disease from the smoking.

197
00:07:52.398 --> 00:07:54.350
But she went to her doctor, and they picked up

198
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.499
an early lung cancer in a Stage I, meaning

199
00:07:58.499 --> 00:08:01.571
it hadn't spread anywhere and resected it,

200
00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:05.283
and I ran into her just several months ago,

201
00:08:05.283 --> 00:08:06.766
and she gave me the file, is doing

202
00:08:06.766 --> 00:08:11.766
extremely well, no known spread, and, you know,

203
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:15.757
it was Harry's visualization of this issue.

204
00:08:15.757 --> 00:08:17.762
He didn't tell her it was lung cancer;

205
00:08:17.762 --> 00:08:18.519
he just said that you should

206
00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:19.586
<v ->He was very diplomatic that way.</v>

207
00:08:19.586 --> 00:08:20.375
<v ->Yeah, he is.</v>

208
00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.424
And also sometimes he doesn' tell you

209
00:08:22.424 --> 00:08:23.704
the energetic changes

210
00:08:23.704 --> 00:08:25.271
don't tell you the exact problem.

211
00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:26.039
<v ->Exactly.</v>

212
00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:28.183
<v ->One of the other beauties is you don't really</v>

213
00:08:28.183 --> 00:08:29.036
have to know the exact problem

214
00:08:29.036 --> 00:08:30.967
to treat things energetically.

215
00:08:30.967 --> 00:08:33.751
Although, again, with medical illnesses

216
00:08:33.751 --> 00:08:36.278
and diagnosis, we always suggest they see their

217
00:08:36.278 --> 00:08:38.348
physicians for follow-up.

218
00:08:38.348 --> 00:08:40.086
<v ->So how often, when you're using this scanning</v>

219
00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:42.763
device working with the client, is this a normal part

220
00:08:42.763 --> 00:08:44.897
of what you would do if you have a new client,

221
00:08:44.897 --> 00:08:45.867
a new patient?

222
00:08:45.867 --> 00:08:48.331
<v ->Well, we, in the emergency, I also work</v>

223
00:08:48.331 --> 00:08:49.174
in emergency medicine.

224
00:08:49.174 --> 00:08:49.910
<v ->Right.</v>

225
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.395
<v ->And I don't use it there.</v>

226
00:08:51.395 --> 00:08:52.135
Mm-hmm.

227
00:08:52.135 --> 00:08:54.251
For one, they were too busy.

228
00:08:54.251 --> 00:08:55.968
You don't have the time.

229
00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:59.317
But we have a Reiki group that meets

230
00:08:59.317 --> 00:09:02.751
once a week that's all day, and it's free

231
00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:06.623
so that patients, if cost is ever an issue.

232
00:09:06.623 --> 00:09:08.138
And the people that attend it,

233
00:09:08.138 --> 00:09:12.148
one of the things it's not required you know Reiki,

234
00:09:12.148 --> 00:09:14.985
that those that attend it, everyone there

235
00:09:14.985 --> 00:09:16.468
gets a healing.

236
00:09:16.468 --> 00:09:18.793
Usually they last about 30 minutes.

237
00:09:18.793 --> 00:09:22.249
And then they learn to participate in how to do them.

238
00:09:22.249 --> 00:09:23.945
Which is tremendously empowering.

239
00:09:23.945 --> 00:09:26.409
For instance, chemotherapy patients.

240
00:09:26.409 --> 00:09:28.286
Some of the chemos are more targeted

241
00:09:28.286 --> 00:09:31.906
and have less side effects, but some of the traditional

242
00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:34.579
chemotherapies caused hair loss, nausea,

243
00:09:34.579 --> 00:09:38.362
vomiting, anemias with low blood counts,

244
00:09:38.362 --> 00:09:40.200
and we found some of these energy therapies

245
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.077
can be quite helpful.

246
00:09:42.077 --> 00:09:45.370
For instance, the nausea that's associated,

247
00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.658
I'm aware of all the usual free radicals and stuff

248
00:09:48.658 --> 00:09:51.442
in traditional chemo that might be behind that.

249
00:09:51.442 --> 00:09:54.524
But energetically, there's an area here called

250
00:09:54.524 --> 00:09:56.412
the third chakra.

251
00:09:56.412 --> 00:09:57.916
If you've ever had a stomach ache,

252
00:09:57.916 --> 00:09:59.356
where do you put your hands?

253
00:09:59.356 --> 00:09:59.793
<v ->Right.</v>

254
00:09:59.793 --> 00:10:01.372
<v ->"Mom, I don't feel good."</v>

255
00:10:01.372 --> 00:10:02.726
Well, the somach's actually up here.

256
00:10:02.726 --> 00:10:05.297
You feel the third chakra.

257
00:10:05.297 --> 00:10:07.302
And you can show them to place their hands there

258
00:10:07.302 --> 00:10:09.531
and give energy and often improve

259
00:10:09.531 --> 00:10:11.590
the nausea and vomiting in as little as

260
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.126
10 or 15 minutes.

261
00:10:13.126 --> 00:10:15.728
And I've had chemotherapy patients,

262
00:10:15.728 --> 00:10:20.528
when Zofran was investigational at the time.

263
00:10:20.528 --> 00:10:22.298
It was extremely expensive, but had been

264
00:10:22.298 --> 00:10:25.946
in vomiting, time after time,

265
00:10:25.946 --> 00:10:28.239
and it's not like the flu where you vomit a few times

266
00:10:28.239 --> 00:10:29.327
and then stop.

267
00:10:29.327 --> 00:10:30.906
So it was just continuous.

268
00:10:30.906 --> 00:10:32.932
And giving her all sorts of medications.

269
00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:36.273
Prednisone, Reglan, Compazine

270
00:10:36.273 --> 00:10:40.015
and then 12 doses of the Zofran hadn't helped,

271
00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:41.455
and I happened to be passing through.

272
00:10:41.455 --> 00:10:42.638
Would you mind seeing her,

273
00:10:42.638 --> 00:10:44.494
and in 15 minutes we're pulling out her IV,

274
00:10:44.494 --> 00:10:45.998
and she goes home.

275
00:10:45.998 --> 00:10:47.769
And one of their comments was,

276
00:10:47.769 --> 00:10:50.254
they actually had used $12,000 of Zofran,

277
00:10:50.254 --> 00:10:51.993
it's much cheaper now,

278
00:10:51.993 --> 00:10:53.198
was that if we tried that first,

279
00:10:53.198 --> 00:10:55.246
we could have saved $12,000.

280
00:10:55.246 --> 00:10:56.270
<v ->Amazing.</v>

281
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.403
<v ->More importantly, you can teach the patients</v>

282
00:10:58.403 --> 00:10:59.939
to do it for themselves.

283
00:10:59.939 --> 00:11:03.870
So before her next chemo she can do that,

284
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.040
hopefully to prevent the nausea and vomiting.

285
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.962
And if she develops it, she can do it for herself.

286
00:11:08.962 --> 00:11:12.119
In addition, I still believe in all the other medications.

287
00:11:12.119 --> 00:11:13.773
But sometimes you don't need them.

288
00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:17.970
We found usefulness in preventing hair loss

289
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.873
or reducing hair loss.

290
00:11:19.873 --> 00:11:22.316
Sue Spitalli, who gives permission to use her name,

291
00:11:22.316 --> 00:11:25.430
had Stage IV lymphoma, very advanced.

292
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:29.932
Told her she'd need a marrow transplant,

293
00:11:29.932 --> 00:11:32.555
and two weeks into her therapy was bald,

294
00:11:32.555 --> 00:11:34.155
had lost all her hair.

295
00:11:34.155 --> 00:11:37.195
Her brother and husband had shaved their heads

296
00:11:37.195 --> 00:11:39.872
in solidarity, a very nice gesture,

297
00:11:39.872 --> 00:11:43.307
but we started doing Reiki on her for the nausea

298
00:11:43.307 --> 00:11:44.395
and the hair.

299
00:11:44.395 --> 00:11:47.157
Her hair grew back faster than theirs did.

300
00:11:47.157 --> 00:11:47.840
<v ->That's amazing.</v>

301
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.088
<v ->Kind of ticking them off,</v>

302
00:11:49.088 --> 00:11:51.242
but more importantly, during the same

303
00:11:51.242 --> 00:11:54.943
chemotherapy that she lost it in the first place.

304
00:11:54.943 --> 00:11:58.420
You know, it's non-toxic, no adverse effects.

305
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.095
We don't promise them they won't lose hair

306
00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:04.105
or that it'll grow back, but we leave room to be well.

307
00:12:04.105 --> 00:12:06.473
<v ->What about the tumors themselves?</v>

308
00:12:06.473 --> 00:12:07.152
<v ->Um.</v>

309
00:12:07.152 --> 00:12:09.129
<v ->And I know it's a little different with various</v>

310
00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:09.830
types of cancers

311
00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:10.385
Sure.

312
00:12:10.385 --> 00:12:11.409
such as leukemia and all,

313
00:12:11.409 --> 00:12:12.649
but what about the tumors themselves?

314
00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.995
Are there any times when you can actually preempt it

315
00:12:14.995 --> 00:12:17.833
when you can see something and preemptively act?

316
00:12:17.833 --> 00:12:22.833
<v ->I again, still a believer in traditional medicine.</v>

317
00:12:23.038 --> 00:12:23.656
<v ->I know.</v>

318
00:12:23.656 --> 00:12:27.635
<v ->We never guarantee that things are going to get better.</v>

319
00:12:27.635 --> 00:12:28.424
One of the things I've learned,

320
00:12:28.424 --> 00:12:30.909
healing isn't always curing.

321
00:12:30.909 --> 00:12:34.962
But we've had some patients do remarkably well.

322
00:12:34.962 --> 00:12:37.682
A university medical center near where I live

323
00:12:37.682 --> 00:12:40.167
noticed a small subset of their patients

324
00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:44.220
were doing very well despite severe disease

325
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.417
and decided to have their nurse practitioner

326
00:12:46.417 --> 00:12:49.297
interview them to see if there was any commonality.

327
00:12:49.297 --> 00:12:51.408
And the interesting thing, all of them attended

328
00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:52.913
our Reiki group.

329
00:12:52.913 --> 00:12:53.564
<v ->( laughter)</v>

330
00:12:53.564 --> 00:12:56.187
<v ->I don't know that the Reiki was responsible.</v>

331
00:12:56.187 --> 00:12:59.643
It might have been their mental attitude and such

332
00:12:59.643 --> 00:13:01.115
or just the fact that they were interested

333
00:13:01.115 --> 00:13:03.664
in wellness and taking care of themselves.

334
00:13:03.664 --> 00:13:05.339
For instance, Joyce Attardo,

335
00:13:05.339 --> 00:13:09.584
who's since passed, but 14 years ago

336
00:13:09.584 --> 00:13:11.674
had a recurrence of breast cancer

337
00:13:11.674 --> 00:13:13.093
all over her body,

338
00:13:13.093 --> 00:13:14.992
eight golf ball sized lesions in the liver,

339
00:13:14.992 --> 00:13:17.711
lung, bone marrow, and the doctor told her

340
00:13:17.711 --> 00:13:20.591
95 percent of the patients in her situation

341
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:23.584
were usually dead in three months.

342
00:13:23.584 --> 00:13:25.583
Not necessarily good news, but you know,

343
00:13:25.583 --> 00:13:27.887
on the other hand, he's not going to lie to the patients

344
00:13:27.887 --> 00:13:29.860
and say you're going to be fine.

345
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:33.433
She asked what did the five percent do.

346
00:13:33.433 --> 00:13:35.609
The five percent that got better.

347
00:13:35.609 --> 00:13:36.548
<v ->Good question.</v>

348
00:13:36.548 --> 00:13:37.870
<v ->That's a great question.</v>

349
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.515
First, what a difference in attitude.

350
00:13:40.515 --> 00:13:44.046
She's not focusing on the people that didn't do well.

351
00:13:44.046 --> 00:13:47.203
She's focusing on being well, and that's a major,

352
00:13:47.203 --> 00:13:49.037
I'm very interested in mind/body/medicine.

353
00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:52.056
That shift alone there told me volumes.

354
00:13:52.056 --> 00:13:57.056
She went on to do a lot of great things for herself,

355
00:13:57.922 --> 00:14:01.015
do incredibly well, great quality of life.

356
00:14:01.015 --> 00:14:03.287
Traveled to Europe three times,

357
00:14:03.287 --> 00:14:04.962
had been a great Italian cook,

358
00:14:04.962 --> 00:14:07.286
and the chemotherapy in the prior two years

359
00:14:07.286 --> 00:14:10.284
had a major impact on her appetite.

360
00:14:10.284 --> 00:14:12.396
She had stopped cooking.

361
00:14:12.396 --> 00:14:14.912
After her very first Reiki treatment, her -

362
00:14:14.912 --> 00:14:17.014
I had seen her because her blood cell count

363
00:14:17.014 --> 00:14:19.681
had gone down to 0.0.

364
00:14:19.681 --> 00:14:21.494
They had her in the hospital for five days

365
00:14:21.494 --> 00:14:24.694
until it came up to 3.5.

366
00:14:24.694 --> 00:14:29.694
She was very tired, and my wife had gone,

367
00:14:30.251 --> 00:14:33.237
she's a big quilter and asked a quilt group

368
00:14:33.237 --> 00:14:35.776
to finish six quilts she started

369
00:14:35.776 --> 00:14:37.813
and hadn't completed in several months

370
00:14:37.813 --> 00:14:40.064
because she was not feeling well and had been told

371
00:14:40.064 --> 00:14:42.485
to get her affairs in order.

372
00:14:42.485 --> 00:14:44.230
They completed them, and she said

373
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:47.039
you know, have you ever thought of trying these things,

374
00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:51.882
so this was the week before she was in the hospital.

375
00:14:51.882 --> 00:14:53.908
She's now come home on a Saturday.

376
00:14:53.908 --> 00:14:57.065
I saw her on a Sunday, one 45-minute session.

377
00:14:57.065 --> 00:14:58.548
"What's your visualization?

378
00:14:58.548 --> 00:15:00.222
"What do you want to do with your blood cells?"

379
00:15:00.222 --> 00:15:02.238
"Oh, I want to raise it to the roof, to the sky,

380
00:15:02.238 --> 00:15:03.614
"to the stars."

381
00:15:03.614 --> 00:15:04.277
<v ->Mm-hmm.</v>

382
00:15:04.277 --> 00:15:05.929
<v ->And then following week, her white count went</v>

383
00:15:05.929 --> 00:15:08.862
from 0.0 to 45,000.

384
00:15:08.862 --> 00:15:10.558
Normal is about 12,000.

385
00:15:10.558 --> 00:15:12.688
<v ->Wow.</v>

386
00:15:12.688 --> 00:15:14.589
<v ->So the following week, I suggested maybe we</v>

387
00:15:14.589 --> 00:15:17.267
should aim for about 12,000,

388
00:15:17.267 --> 00:15:19.219
and it was 12.3 the following week,

389
00:15:19.219 --> 00:15:21.725
and they also repeated the 45,000 to be

390
00:15:21.725 --> 00:15:24.882
certain that was correct, which it was.

391
00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:28.018
So you can see for some people how the power

392
00:15:28.018 --> 00:15:32.124
of the mind can have a huge influence.

393
00:15:32.124 --> 00:15:33.522
Why not tap into it?

394
00:15:33.522 --> 00:15:35.026
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>

395
00:15:35.026 --> 00:15:38.119
And along with that, I mean you're using intention

396
00:15:38.119 --> 00:15:39.921
with almost all these modalities.

397
00:15:39.921 --> 00:15:40.285
<v ->Sure.</v>

398
00:15:40.285 --> 00:15:41.026
<v ->Anyway, right?</v>

399
00:15:41.026 --> 00:15:42.716
<v ->Well, intention is probably one of the most</v>

400
00:15:42.716 --> 00:15:46.406
key important factors here,

401
00:15:46.406 --> 00:15:50.214
and we, in traditional medicine we are very much

402
00:15:50.214 --> 00:15:53.982
into the medications and the physicality of things

403
00:15:53.982 --> 00:15:55.856
and stitch the laceration.

404
00:15:55.856 --> 00:15:59.269
But what about the intention for it to heal?

405
00:15:59.269 --> 00:16:01.147
Before each and every patient,

406
00:16:01.147 --> 00:16:05.238
I go in, I consciously set the intention to help them.

407
00:16:05.238 --> 00:16:06.490
Can that make a difference?

408
00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.207
For me, I totally believe it does.

409
00:16:08.207 --> 00:16:10.693
And for me, it does for that reason.

410
00:16:10.693 --> 00:16:12.037
And the amazing thing if you believe

411
00:16:12.037 --> 00:16:14.010
it doesn't make a difference, it won't.

412
00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:16.452
Because that's your belief system and your influence.

413
00:16:16.452 --> 00:16:17.636
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

414
00:16:17.636 --> 00:16:19.439
In fact, just to interject, a dear friend of mine

415
00:16:19.439 --> 00:16:22.116
had a very, very difficult surgery.

416
00:16:22.116 --> 00:16:23.737
It was an ileostomy.

417
00:16:23.737 --> 00:16:24.324
<v ->Oh sure.</v>

418
00:16:24.324 --> 00:16:26.553
<v ->Which is going to be classically very bloody.</v>

419
00:16:26.553 --> 00:16:28.057
And she had, she was pretty much

420
00:16:28.057 --> 00:16:29.006
in and out of consciousness.

421
00:16:29.006 --> 00:16:29.934
They didn't know if she'd make it

422
00:16:29.934 --> 00:16:33.427
to the next day, honestly, it had gone so far.

423
00:16:33.427 --> 00:16:34.926
The internal bleeding.

424
00:16:34.926 --> 00:16:38.062
She said to herself, and she had enough energy

425
00:16:38.062 --> 00:16:40.920
to tell the doctor before the operation,

426
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:45.337
"This will be a bloodless surgery."

427
00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:47.821
And she's still legend in the hospital to this day.

428
00:16:47.821 --> 00:16:50.445
The nurses and doctors still talk about the fact

429
00:16:50.445 --> 00:16:52.482
that there was almost no blood

430
00:16:52.482 --> 00:16:54.615
in a classically bloody surgery.

431
00:16:54.615 --> 00:16:55.756
<v ->Sure.</v>

432
00:16:55.756 --> 00:16:58.082
Well, I think you can, you know.

433
00:16:58.082 --> 00:17:01.932
There are sometimes just about everything you do

434
00:17:01.932 --> 00:17:03.607
the outcome isn't what you desire.

435
00:17:03.607 --> 00:17:08.544
But I think you can improve a lot of these outcomes.

436
00:17:08.544 --> 00:17:10.060
There was a patient, and I actually took care

437
00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:15.060
of the driver, but it was a truck in a bad accident

438
00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:20.064
and the 17-year-old female in it had a liver laceration

439
00:17:20.064 --> 00:17:21.366
and nearly bled to death.

440
00:17:21.366 --> 00:17:25.525
Her blood level, which was normal at 40% when she arrived,

441
00:17:25.525 --> 00:17:27.477
went down to 14%,

442
00:17:27.477 --> 00:17:29.397
which normally would be lethal,

443
00:17:29.397 --> 00:17:32.448
but she was young, we transfused her aggressively,

444
00:17:32.448 --> 00:17:37.448
four units of blood, and for three days it stayed at 27%.

445
00:17:37.994 --> 00:17:40.223
Well, she also fractured one of the bones

446
00:17:40.223 --> 00:17:41.290
in her spine,

447
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.703
the first lumbar was compressed, a compression fracture,

448
00:17:44.703 --> 00:17:46.185
and having severe pain.

449
00:17:46.185 --> 00:17:49.673
She was in the ICU, and her family actually

450
00:17:49.673 --> 00:17:51.486
asked me to see her for the pain.

451
00:17:51.486 --> 00:17:53.716
She hadn't been out of bed for three days.

452
00:17:53.716 --> 00:17:57.919
And we went in and used both Reiki and something

453
00:17:57.919 --> 00:18:02.067
called Hemi-Sync, a sound kind of therapy,

454
00:18:02.067 --> 00:18:04.136
for a 30-minute session,

455
00:18:04.136 --> 00:18:05.459
and she was able to get out of bed

456
00:18:05.459 --> 00:18:07.987
right after the session.

457
00:18:07.987 --> 00:18:11.318
Interestingly, her blood level at 27%,

458
00:18:11.318 --> 00:18:13.512
we did four treatments over five days.

459
00:18:13.512 --> 00:18:15.026
I was out of town one day,

460
00:18:15.026 --> 00:18:19.411
went from 27% to 36%.

461
00:18:19.411 --> 00:18:22.130
That's the equivalent of a three-unit transfusion

462
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:23.943
without the $1,500 cost,

463
00:18:23.943 --> 00:18:26.119
without the risk of Hepatitis, AIDS,

464
00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:29.393
or any other blood borne illness.

465
00:18:29.393 --> 00:18:33.041
And the fourth day when I went up,

466
00:18:33.041 --> 00:18:34.758
she was illegally off the sixth floor

467
00:18:34.758 --> 00:18:35.718
down in the lobby,

468
00:18:35.718 --> 00:18:37.382
so she was getting around a lot better.

469
00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:39.437
<v ->(soft laughter) Amazing.</v>

470
00:18:39.437 --> 00:18:42.598
Before we continue on to another

471
00:18:42.598 --> 00:18:43.952
subject I'd like to get into with you,

472
00:18:43.952 --> 00:18:44.976
I'd like to go back to the PIP

473
00:18:44.976 --> 00:18:45.702
a little bit again.

474
00:18:45.702 --> 00:18:47.387
Tell us, if you would, some of the other

475
00:18:47.387 --> 00:18:49.296
things you've noticed or discovered using the

476
00:18:49.296 --> 00:18:51.173
technology with the patients.

477
00:18:51.173 --> 00:18:53.541
<v ->Well, one of the things I found, both Harry and I</v>

478
00:18:53.541 --> 00:18:54.725
have found interesting,

479
00:18:54.725 --> 00:18:58.213
is the potential use of PIP for mental

480
00:18:58.213 --> 00:19:00.165
and psychiatric illnesses.

481
00:19:00.165 --> 00:19:04.658
Because we've seen patients with very distinct

482
00:19:04.658 --> 00:19:06.831
changes in their fields.

483
00:19:06.831 --> 00:19:10.820
One of a psychotic 15-year-old crack addict

484
00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.723
who was hearing voices telling her very bad

485
00:19:14.723 --> 00:19:16.345
negative things,

486
00:19:16.345 --> 00:19:18.222
and you could see changes in what's called

487
00:19:18.222 --> 00:19:19.715
the crown charka here,

488
00:19:19.715 --> 00:19:22.339
which was split in half.

489
00:19:22.339 --> 00:19:24.984
She was acting out sexually,

490
00:19:24.984 --> 00:19:27.768
and you could see changes in the base chakra

491
00:19:27.768 --> 00:19:30.532
in her pelvis area,

492
00:19:30.532 --> 00:19:33.827
and it also brings to mind that not only its use

493
00:19:33.827 --> 00:19:37.656
as possibly as a diagnostic tool.

494
00:19:37.656 --> 00:19:39.352
I mean traditionally it takes a long time

495
00:19:39.352 --> 00:19:42.210
to interview these patients and get all the facts,

496
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.621
which is still important and needed to be done.

497
00:19:44.621 --> 00:19:47.735
But it would be nice to just take a quick peek that

498
00:19:47.735 --> 00:19:49.452
might give you some idea or direction

499
00:19:49.452 --> 00:19:50.594
on how to head.

500
00:19:50.594 --> 00:19:54.636
But it also begs a question, perhaps energetic therapies

501
00:19:54.636 --> 00:19:56.769
might be of benefit to these patients.

502
00:19:56.769 --> 00:19:58.230
I mean, I'm, again, a big believer in

503
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:02.588
traditional medicines, but there are

504
00:20:02.588 --> 00:20:05.750
areas like thought field therapy,

505
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:10.304
using energy medicine type of ideas to

506
00:20:10.304 --> 00:20:13.675
treat psychiatric illnesses, rapid eye movement

507
00:20:13.675 --> 00:20:15.808
desensitization.

508
00:20:15.808 --> 00:20:17.803
There was a friend of mine who was

509
00:20:17.803 --> 00:20:22.336
a Vietnam Veteran, a Navy Seal, waking up

510
00:20:22.336 --> 00:20:25.369
cold sweats every night.

511
00:20:25.369 --> 00:20:28.137
His wife occasionally he would be strangling

512
00:20:28.137 --> 00:20:29.098
her in bed.

513
00:20:29.098 --> 00:20:32.554
I mean, she would stop him and bring him back quickly,

514
00:20:32.554 --> 00:20:34.740
but it happened on a pretty frequent,

515
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.084
very disruptive basis.

516
00:20:36.084 --> 00:20:37.865
Years of therapy.

517
00:20:37.865 --> 00:20:41.470
One 30-minute session, it was gone.

518
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:42.068
<v ->Amazing.</v>

519
00:20:42.068 --> 00:20:43.817
<v ->To this day, I still, I was present</v>

520
00:20:43.817 --> 00:20:45.630
when it occurred.

521
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:46.089
<v ->Amazing.</v>

522
00:20:46.089 --> 00:20:47.347
<v ->When he was having the therapy.</v>

523
00:20:47.347 --> 00:20:50.430
It was, it looked so easy.

524
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:51.518
<v ->Right.</v>

525
00:20:51.518 --> 00:20:54.535
<v ->But it has to do with the idea of</v>

526
00:20:54.535 --> 00:20:58.475
some acupuncture with energy and intentions.

527
00:20:58.475 --> 00:21:02.696
If you think of Meridian or acupuncture systems

528
00:21:02.696 --> 00:21:06.034
being wiring for various parts of the body,

529
00:21:06.034 --> 00:21:07.730
it might make sense.

530
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.023
To affect the brain by plugging into

531
00:21:10.023 --> 00:21:12.722
one of the sockets somewhere else.

532
00:21:12.722 --> 00:21:16.668
And I've seen it in multiple other occasions

533
00:21:16.668 --> 00:21:18.599
be very effective for them.

534
00:21:18.599 --> 00:21:22.566
<v ->And you, off camera you were telling me about colic.</v>

535
00:21:22.566 --> 00:21:23.174
<v ->Okay.</v>

536
00:21:23.174 --> 00:21:24.636
<v ->And this could be really good news some parents.</v>

537
00:21:24.636 --> 00:21:27.091
<v ->Oh, infant colic.</v>

538
00:21:27.091 --> 00:21:28.993
One of the easiest things,

539
00:21:28.993 --> 00:21:31.291
it's usually a third chakra issue.

540
00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:33.595
It's in the upper tummy area here,

541
00:21:33.595 --> 00:21:37.435
and you don't need to know much about it.

542
00:21:37.435 --> 00:21:39.259
It can't be that easy.

543
00:21:39.259 --> 00:21:41.379
Derek was six months old.

544
00:21:41.379 --> 00:21:43.749
We were entertaining several families,

545
00:21:43.749 --> 00:21:46.480
and screaming for the past 24 hours,

546
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.061
the mom looked fit to be tied.

547
00:21:49.061 --> 00:21:51.055
And I simply asked if I could hold Derek,

548
00:21:51.055 --> 00:21:52.619
and, "Here, take him."

549
00:21:52.619 --> 00:21:54.978
<v ->And you had the camera on at this time?</v>

550
00:21:54.988 --> 00:21:56.058
<v ->We actually had someone there</v>

551
00:21:56.058 --> 00:22:01.058
who had a the camera was available who,

552
00:22:02.169 --> 00:22:04.047
when I picked up the child up,

553
00:22:04.047 --> 00:22:05.433
stopped crying immediately,

554
00:22:05.433 --> 00:22:10.043
so they started taking images.

555
00:22:10.043 --> 00:22:14.563
And you basically all you have to do

556
00:22:14.563 --> 00:22:17.208
if you picture sunshine coming in the top of your head,

557
00:22:17.208 --> 00:22:20.024
not your hands or however you like to visualize it,

558
00:22:20.024 --> 00:22:22.275
white light,

559
00:22:22.275 --> 00:22:23.064
it's that simple.

560
00:22:23.064 --> 00:22:27.074
It helps to turn the thought system on

561
00:22:27.074 --> 00:22:28.770
to send these energies.

562
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.765
And for the left-brain skeptic

563
00:22:30.765 --> 00:22:33.207
who says it can't be that easy, it can.

564
00:22:33.207 --> 00:22:33.939
It doesn't have to be hard.

565
00:22:33.939 --> 00:22:35.072
<v ->Well, you were watching it at the time.</v>

566
00:22:35.072 --> 00:22:35.459
<v ->Yes.</v>

567
00:22:35.459 --> 00:22:37.011
<v ->So you picked the baby up.</v>

568
00:22:37.011 --> 00:22:39.479
<v ->Well, the amazing thing is in about eight minutes,</v>

569
00:22:39.479 --> 00:22:42.242
he was asleep.

570
00:22:42.242 --> 00:22:43.820
And you can do this with your own child.

571
00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.932
I had a friend, a radiologist,

572
00:22:45.932 --> 00:22:48.086
who had twins and every night had to

573
00:22:48.086 --> 00:22:49.900
put them in the car and drive them for two hours

574
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.289
until they'd fall asleep.

575
00:22:52.289 --> 00:22:54.081
And he would do two at once,

576
00:22:54.081 --> 00:22:56.630
both in the back, one hand on knee.

577
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:57.355
<v ->(laughing) A double Reiki Master.</v>

578
00:22:57.355 --> 00:22:59.606
<v ->And said geez, if he learned this earlier,</v>

579
00:22:59.606 --> 00:23:02.720
he could have saved 100,000 miles of driving time.

580
00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.832
<v ->(laughing) That's interesting.</v>

581
00:23:04.832 --> 00:23:08.201
Well, I assume that the applications to be able

582
00:23:08.201 --> 00:23:11.402
to have the validation of using the PIP

583
00:23:11.402 --> 00:23:12.800
to see exactly

584
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.815
what's going on with these ancient modalities

585
00:23:14.815 --> 00:23:17.141
of healing that you know about and others

586
00:23:17.141 --> 00:23:18.207
like you know about.

587
00:23:18.207 --> 00:23:18.687
<v ->Yes.</v>

588
00:23:18.687 --> 00:23:21.599
<v ->Others are terribly skeptical about really is this,</v>

589
00:23:21.599 --> 00:23:23.935
that is the gift, that's an incredible gift

590
00:23:23.935 --> 00:23:24.874
to be able to see this universe.

591
00:23:24.874 --> 00:23:25.588
<v ->Well, it is.</v>

592
00:23:25.588 --> 00:23:29.471
Some of the perceptions you've had you get to validate

593
00:23:29.471 --> 00:23:34.471
and actually see them take place on camera.

594
00:23:34.902 --> 00:23:38.131
We had some work we were doing at a mind/body

595
00:23:38.131 --> 00:23:40.915
research institute in Virginia,

596
00:23:40.915 --> 00:23:45.672
and someone who was psychically gifted

597
00:23:45.672 --> 00:23:47.293
that was a graduate of the Barbara Brennan

598
00:23:47.293 --> 00:23:49.320
School of Healing so they saw a white cross

599
00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.317
on their chest when they did the healing work,

600
00:23:52.317 --> 00:23:55.496
and when we imaged her while doing that,

601
00:23:55.496 --> 00:23:57.959
she had a white cross on her chest.

602
00:23:57.959 --> 00:24:02.364
And it was, we all kind of looked at one another

603
00:24:02.364 --> 00:24:05.852
to say, "Wow," that's an amazing synchronicity

604
00:24:05.852 --> 00:24:08.145
to actually see that take place.

605
00:24:08.145 --> 00:24:11.185
<v ->Well, you're quite comfortable with all of this now,</v>

606
00:24:11.185 --> 00:24:13.073
I assume nothing really surprises you that

607
00:24:13.073 --> 00:24:14.630
comes out on these images.

608
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.412
One of the things yesterday watching you

609
00:24:16.412 --> 00:24:18.406
was the images coming out of the crystal

610
00:24:18.406 --> 00:24:20.379
when you were doing a crystal healing on someone.

611
00:24:20.379 --> 00:24:20.891
<v ->Yes.</v>

612
00:24:20.891 --> 00:24:22.801
<v ->Now, a lot of people don't understand crystals</v>

613
00:24:22.801 --> 00:24:24.934
and don't understand how to work with them.

614
00:24:24.934 --> 00:24:27.376
It's pretty and they'll set it down and look at it

615
00:24:27.376 --> 00:24:28.784
from time to time,

616
00:24:28.784 --> 00:24:30.971
but actually, it doesn't have to be

617
00:24:30.971 --> 00:24:32.528
that difficult in working with.

618
00:24:32.528 --> 00:24:34.171
<v ->Oh, actually anybody can.</v>

619
00:24:34.171 --> 00:24:35.354
They're very simple.

620
00:24:35.354 --> 00:24:37.477
The Native Americans used turquoise.

621
00:24:37.477 --> 00:24:40.122
They made squash blossom necklaces here.

622
00:24:40.122 --> 00:24:41.466
Torquoise is a blue stone.

623
00:24:41.466 --> 00:24:44.133
It has tremendous healing ability

624
00:24:44.133 --> 00:24:47.524
for both the heart and the throat chakra.

625
00:24:47.524 --> 00:24:49.594
And so it's a natural great stone to place

626
00:24:49.594 --> 00:24:51.172
in those areas.

627
00:24:51.172 --> 00:24:54.905
But, you know, you can measure frequencies

628
00:24:54.905 --> 00:24:56.484
of vibrations of crystals.

629
00:24:56.484 --> 00:24:58.809
We've been doing it in the lab for years.

630
00:24:58.809 --> 00:25:01.625
If you stimulate crystals with electricity,

631
00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:02.851
they vibrate.

632
00:25:02.851 --> 00:25:04.249
If you compress crystals, they will

633
00:25:04.249 --> 00:25:06.776
generate electricity or you can rub two quartz

634
00:25:06.776 --> 00:25:10.013
crystals in the dark and get light.

635
00:25:10.013 --> 00:25:12.941
I used to do that a lot in demonstrations until

636
00:25:12.941 --> 00:25:16.013
and I had two enormous ones I was rubbing together,

637
00:25:16.013 --> 00:25:18.434
and you could see them light up.

638
00:25:18.434 --> 00:25:19.640
And then one of them shattered,

639
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.866
so I stopped doing that.

640
00:25:20.866 --> 00:25:22.306
<v ->(laughter)</v>

641
00:25:22.306 --> 00:25:26.093
<v ->But you can actually see the field as they project.</v>

642
00:25:26.093 --> 00:25:28.460
You can also see the effects of different shapes.

643
00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:32.503
When they're long and have very fine terminations,

644
00:25:32.503 --> 00:25:33.847
they come to a nice point,

645
00:25:33.847 --> 00:25:35.937
you'll see it project like a flashlight.

646
00:25:35.937 --> 00:25:39.980
Versus a circular one that radiates like a globe,

647
00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.115
like you might expect.

648
00:25:42.115 --> 00:25:45.014
<v ->If a person watching this is thinking,</v>

649
00:25:45.014 --> 00:25:46.923
"My gosh, I really need to start getting on board

650
00:25:46.923 --> 00:25:49.408
"my own healing train," and say they wanted to work with,

651
00:25:49.408 --> 00:25:51.979
well, Reiki we know you can get to Reiki.

652
00:25:51.979 --> 00:25:52.421
<v ->Mm-hmm.</v>

653
00:25:52.421 --> 00:25:54.464
<v ->You can take a class and learn how to do Reiki</v>

654
00:25:54.464 --> 00:25:55.445
and become certified.

655
00:25:55.445 --> 00:25:56.928
But say they want to work with crystals.

656
00:25:56.928 --> 00:25:58.528
Are there certain characteristics you look for

657
00:25:58.528 --> 00:26:02.101
in crystals that would be used as a healing crystal?

658
00:26:02.101 --> 00:26:03.424
<v ->We could spend a month.</v>

659
00:26:03.424 --> 00:26:04.448
<v ->(laughter)</v>

660
00:26:04.448 --> 00:26:08.877
<v ->You know, at first it doesn't have to be hard.</v>

661
00:26:08.877 --> 00:26:12.020
When we, we use them in our healing group,

662
00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.364
you can use any crystal anywhere.

663
00:26:13.364 --> 00:26:14.687
That's the first rule.

664
00:26:14.687 --> 00:26:16.959
You will hear about specific crystals being great

665
00:26:16.959 --> 00:26:18.239
for specific things,

666
00:26:18.239 --> 00:26:19.188
and there are.

667
00:26:19.188 --> 00:26:23.369
Lapis is good around the throat and on the forehead.

668
00:26:23.369 --> 00:26:25.438
Amethyst is great on the heart

669
00:26:25.438 --> 00:26:27.966
and also on the stomach for nausea.

670
00:26:27.966 --> 00:26:30.249
But any crystal will work anywhere,

671
00:26:30.249 --> 00:26:33.683
and the internet's a great place to start.

672
00:26:33.683 --> 00:26:36.744
There is so much information out there.

673
00:26:36.744 --> 00:26:41.744
If you look, ICEM. We're here for the ICEM Conference.

674
00:26:41.949 --> 00:26:45.682
I love this conference and everything about it.

675
00:26:45.682 --> 00:26:49.586
They get into some incredibly wonderful areas,

676
00:26:49.586 --> 00:26:54.586
crystal healing and this PIP imaging,

677
00:26:55.194 --> 00:26:56.508
when you look through the list of speakers

678
00:26:56.508 --> 00:26:58.855
internationally known,

679
00:26:58.855 --> 00:27:01.308
and there's a lot of scientific validation

680
00:27:01.308 --> 00:27:02.289
that goes with it.

681
00:27:02.289 --> 00:27:04.721
One of the things that appeals to me.

682
00:27:04.721 --> 00:27:08.625
We're not talking this woo-woo kind of stuff.

683
00:27:08.625 --> 00:27:10.854
Quantum physicists explaining a lot of these energies.

684
00:27:10.854 --> 00:27:12.315
<v ->Some of the top quantum physicists.</v>

685
00:27:12.315 --> 00:27:13.595
<v ->Oh, quantum physicists.</v>

686
00:27:13.595 --> 00:27:14.155
Claude Swanson's here.

687
00:27:14.155 --> 00:27:14.848
<v ->John Hagelin.</v>

688
00:27:14.848 --> 00:27:15.166
<v ->John Hagelin.</v>

689
00:27:15.166 --> 00:27:17.427
<v ->Yup.</v>

690
00:27:17.427 --> 00:27:19.729
<v ->You know, Claude Swanson.</v>

691
00:27:19.729 --> 00:27:21.253
<v ->He's wonderful. He's on this site, too.</v>

692
00:27:21.303 --> 00:27:22.043
We've interviewed him.

693
00:27:22.043 --> 00:27:23.952
<v ->Yes, he actually,</v>

694
00:27:23.952 --> 00:27:25.338
we put on a conference in Rochester.

695
00:27:25.338 --> 00:27:26.480
He was one of the speakers,

696
00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.453
along with Dr. Norm Shealy,

697
00:27:28.453 --> 00:27:32.399
who just one of the nicest, most sincere,

698
00:27:32.399 --> 00:27:37.399
incredible healers/teachers, and he's a neurosurgeon.

699
00:27:38.394 --> 00:27:40.015
And he invented the Tens Unit,

700
00:27:40.015 --> 00:27:43.355
which I remember using on a patient,

701
00:27:43.355 --> 00:27:45.305
I originally trained in surgery that we had

702
00:27:45.305 --> 00:27:46.446
taken her gallbladder out,

703
00:27:46.446 --> 00:27:48.814
was so impressed how it reduced the pain

704
00:27:48.814 --> 00:27:50.510
in the incision,

705
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.520
and it was enormously satisfying to meet him here

706
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.035
years, later, to meet the man who invented it

707
00:27:56.035 --> 00:28:00.771
and then find out he seems so normal

708
00:28:00.771 --> 00:28:02.978
and balanced on the surface.

709
00:28:02.978 --> 00:28:05.517
He's so way out there, I looked normal.

710
00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:05.753
<v ->(laughter)</v>

711
00:28:05.753 --> 00:28:06.533
<v ->It was so incredible.</v>

712
00:28:06.533 --> 00:28:07.923
But he's so intelligent.

713
00:28:07.923 --> 00:28:10.704
<v ->Yeah. Everybody here is absolutely brilliant.</v>

714
00:28:10.704 --> 00:28:11.426
<v ->Yes.</v>

715
00:28:11.426 --> 00:28:14.007
<v ->So in wrapping it up, I mean one of the,</v>

716
00:28:14.007 --> 00:28:15.469
you work with The Monroe Institute,

717
00:28:15.469 --> 00:28:17.858
you've worked with some of the Hemi-Sync.

718
00:28:17.858 --> 00:28:20.140
Also, I noticed on your bio something about

719
00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.527
the Dolphin Energy Club.

720
00:28:21.527 --> 00:28:22.039
<v ->Yes.</v>

721
00:28:22.039 --> 00:28:25.217
<v ->Where you actually do remote healing as well.</v>

722
00:28:25.217 --> 00:28:25.751
<v ->Yes.</v>

723
00:28:25.751 --> 00:28:27.031
<v ->And this is really important to know that we are</v>

724
00:28:27.031 --> 00:28:29.334
not limited by time and space to heal one another.

725
00:28:29.334 --> 00:28:30.145
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

726
00:28:30.145 --> 00:28:32.416
In Reiki, in second degree Reiki you will also

727
00:28:32.416 --> 00:28:33.878
learn about that.

728
00:28:33.878 --> 00:28:35.990
One of the thoughts,

729
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.966
can we affect healing from a distance?

730
00:28:38.966 --> 00:28:39.638
Absolutely.

731
00:28:39.638 --> 00:28:42.262
There have been studies, Columbia, I believe it was

732
00:28:42.262 --> 00:28:45.376
Columbia Presbyterian 53 patients in the control group

733
00:28:45.376 --> 00:28:46.720
in the ICU,

734
00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.320
53 in the experimental,

735
00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.506
and the experimental, they were prayed for

736
00:28:50.506 --> 00:28:51.712
in various ways.

737
00:28:51.712 --> 00:28:56.712
Some, you know, Christian, Muslim, Jewish.

738
00:28:57.119 --> 00:29:00.053
And the importance was not the modality of prayer,

739
00:29:00.053 --> 00:29:02.996
but the fact that they were prayed for.

740
00:29:02.996 --> 00:29:06.183
And prayer is just focused intention.

741
00:29:06.183 --> 00:29:09.289
And the experimental group had no deaths,

742
00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:12.748
less intubations, were discharged sooner from the ICU,

743
00:29:12.748 --> 00:29:14.441
and it was statistically significant.

744
00:29:14.441 --> 00:29:17.118
And this has been replicated many times over.

745
00:29:17.118 --> 00:29:19.646
In the Dolphin Energy Club,

746
00:29:19.646 --> 00:29:22.408
we actually have a lab there, and we

747
00:29:22.408 --> 00:29:25.363
brain mapped with an EEG machine and had

748
00:29:25.363 --> 00:29:27.496
many different people,

749
00:29:27.496 --> 00:29:29.821
some of them very famous healers,

750
00:29:29.821 --> 00:29:33.233
do their healing and measured their brain wave pattern.

751
00:29:33.233 --> 00:29:37.300
What we did was then go and engineer

752
00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.201
what kind of sound pattern might produce

753
00:29:40.201 --> 00:29:42.942
that brain wave spectrum.

754
00:29:42.942 --> 00:29:46.376
So that you could listen to it and sort of learn

755
00:29:46.376 --> 00:29:51.376
to very quickly be able to project healing energy.

756
00:29:52.433 --> 00:29:54.591
Which is actually easy to do even without

757
00:29:54.591 --> 00:29:55.297
the taped proceeding.

758
00:29:55.297 --> 00:29:56.582
<v ->Just with pure intention?</v>

759
00:29:56.582 --> 00:29:58.312
<v ->With pure intention.</v>

760
00:29:58.312 --> 00:29:59.122
<v ->What's one of your favorite -</v>

761
00:29:59.122 --> 00:30:00.637
give us a little visualization that you find,

762
00:30:00.637 --> 00:30:02.749
just a simple favorite that people can begin

763
00:30:02.749 --> 00:30:03.155
working with

764
00:30:03.155 --> 00:30:04.216
<v ->Sure.</v>

765
00:30:04.216 --> 00:30:05.200
<v ->with someone who's not feeling well perhaps.</v>

766
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.455
<v ->We actually have someone we just saw a short while ago</v>

767
00:30:08.455 --> 00:30:12.455
who was in coma, and I can just visualize,

768
00:30:12.455 --> 00:30:14.311
just picture him in my head,

769
00:30:14.311 --> 00:30:19.187
and it's as simple as sending loving, toughtful intentions.

770
00:30:19.187 --> 00:30:20.998
And for people that don't think it could be

771
00:30:20.998 --> 00:30:24.614
that simple or be effective, you know,

772
00:30:24.614 --> 00:30:26.918
we have studies to show that it is.

773
00:30:26.918 --> 00:30:28.144
And that's the beginning.

774
00:30:28.144 --> 00:30:32.699
It's just simply just good thoughts and intentions.

775
00:30:32.699 --> 00:30:35.088
You know, if we put someone in the room

776
00:30:35.088 --> 00:30:38.714
and send loving kind of thoughts,

777
00:30:38.714 --> 00:30:41.360
they will feel better after 10 or 15 minutes versus

778
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.706
if you send very negative thoughts.

779
00:30:43.706 --> 00:30:44.613
They will feel worse.

780
00:30:44.613 --> 00:30:46.298
So we can actually image and show their field

781
00:30:46.298 --> 00:30:49.178
expand or contract with the PIP system.

782
00:30:49.178 --> 00:30:51.012
And if you ask them how they feel,

783
00:30:51.012 --> 00:30:53.967
they will report a subjective difference.

784
00:30:53.967 --> 00:30:55.727
"Oh, I feel better now."

785
00:30:55.727 --> 00:30:57.561
But even if you blind them and tell

786
00:30:57.561 --> 00:31:02.468
the experimental group, "Think warm loving thoughts,"

787
00:31:02.468 --> 00:31:03.854
actually, at this point in time,

788
00:31:03.854 --> 00:31:08.854
I never send anything negative for just that reason.

789
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:13.144
We used to do both, and you would see a very consistent

790
00:31:13.144 --> 00:31:15.438
pattern or change in people.

791
00:31:15.438 --> 00:31:17.251
Same thing when I approach my patients.

792
00:31:17.251 --> 00:31:20.152
That's why I always check my stuff at the door.

793
00:31:20.152 --> 00:31:22.754
If I'm carrying a lot of emotional baggage,

794
00:31:22.754 --> 00:31:27.074
I stop to clear those and intend

795
00:31:27.074 --> 00:31:29.837
to have a very loving, warm, healing environment

796
00:31:29.837 --> 00:31:33.207
for this special person I'm about to see.

797
00:31:33.207 --> 00:31:34.807
<v ->And that's interesting because we always,</v>

798
00:31:34.807 --> 00:31:36.663
in many of these interviews we get back

799
00:31:36.663 --> 00:31:38.711
to the word "love" for all that it means,

800
00:31:38.711 --> 00:31:39.756
and it means many things to many people.

801
00:31:39.756 --> 00:31:41.751
<v ->It is the greatest healer.</v>

802
00:31:41.751 --> 00:31:45.164
And does it work? Well, I think so.

803
00:31:45.164 --> 00:31:48.107
My Press Ganey scores which the hospital measures

804
00:31:48.107 --> 00:31:50.017
are out of sight,

805
00:31:50.017 --> 00:31:55.017
as one of my recent job performance appraisals,

806
00:31:57.867 --> 00:31:59.595
the chair of the department at that time

807
00:31:59.595 --> 00:32:03.978
said there were more letters of thanks and excellence

808
00:32:03.978 --> 00:32:05.909
in mine than all the other physicians

809
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:08.736
in our department combined.

810
00:32:08.736 --> 00:32:10.111
I don't think it's an accident.

811
00:32:10.111 --> 00:32:11.893
<v ->It's the love. The love you put into them.</v>

812
00:32:11.893 --> 00:32:12.479
<v ->Yes.</v>

813
00:32:12.479 --> 00:32:13.247
<v ->The open mindedness.</v>

814
00:32:13.247 --> 00:32:15.188
<v ->And they feel it.</v>

815
00:32:15.188 --> 00:32:16.266
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

816
00:32:16.266 --> 00:32:20.468
Well, I wish I had known doctors like you

817
00:32:20.468 --> 00:32:22.623
throughout my life, and everybody watching I'm sure

818
00:32:22.623 --> 00:32:25.289
wishes their doctor were like your doctor.

819
00:32:25.289 --> 00:32:27.892
And in the interim, we really need to start

820
00:32:27.892 --> 00:32:30.313
taking it upon ourselves to do the healing.

821
00:32:30.313 --> 00:32:33.278
<v ->Well, that is the biggest key you just here there, Regina.</v>

822
00:32:33.278 --> 00:32:36.787
Is you don't need to wait.

823
00:32:36.787 --> 00:32:37.875
Take care of ourselves.

824
00:32:37.875 --> 00:32:41.821
We're in this hectic, frantic-paced, you know,

825
00:32:41.821 --> 00:32:44.307
job, cell phones.

826
00:32:44.307 --> 00:32:46.493
Cell phones, I think are one of the

827
00:32:46.493 --> 00:32:49.576
greatest technological advances

828
00:32:49.576 --> 00:32:53.319
and one of the worst interferences in our life.

829
00:32:53.319 --> 00:32:56.242
You know, I don't like to carry mine.

830
00:32:56.242 --> 00:32:58.567
I do in important times

831
00:32:58.567 --> 00:33:01.762
just because I don't want it interrupting me.

832
00:33:01.762 --> 00:33:03.484
Take time for a massage.

833
00:33:03.484 --> 00:33:04.924
Take time to stop.

834
00:33:04.924 --> 00:33:08.220
One of the things my cancer patients taught me, you know,

835
00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.545
one of the great lessons is live for the moment.

836
00:33:10.545 --> 00:33:13.260
I went after one of them planted a rose garden

837
00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.519
because they could stop and literally smell the roses.

838
00:33:16.519 --> 00:33:18.811
I borrowed their idea and put them in my backyard,

839
00:33:18.811 --> 00:33:21.179
and in the summer when it's beautiful out,

840
00:33:21.179 --> 00:33:22.779
no matter how hectic when I get home,

841
00:33:22.779 --> 00:33:25.029
the first thing take the shoes off, walk in the grass

842
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:26.448
and smell them.

843
00:33:26.448 --> 00:33:29.372
The rest of your day's gotta be better.

844
00:33:29.372 --> 00:33:32.208
<v ->What, what truth. Simple wisdom.</v>

845
00:33:32.208 --> 00:33:33.253
So true.

846
00:33:33.253 --> 00:33:35.130
Anything that you would like to share with us

847
00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:37.871
as we wrap this conversation up?

848
00:33:37.871 --> 00:33:40.378
It's just been delightful sitting with you.

849
00:33:40.378 --> 00:33:42.863
<v ->Well, I'd send them loving, warm intentions</v>

850
00:33:42.863 --> 00:33:44.772
for everyone that's watching this

851
00:33:44.772 --> 00:33:47.204
and you'll feel better today.

852
00:33:47.204 --> 00:33:50.852
Take a few moments to think that and appreciate it.

853
00:33:50.852 --> 00:33:52.014
<v ->Thank you so much.</v>

854
00:33:52.014 --> 00:33:56.435
<v ->Thank you very much, Regina.</v>

855
00:33:56.435 --> 00:33:58.286
<v ->Brian Dailey certainly gives new meaning to</v>

856
00:33:58.286 --> 00:34:00.537
what it means to be called "The Good Doctor."

857
00:34:00.537 --> 00:34:03.160
Meanwhile, to find out more about the PIP technology,

858
00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.646
you won't want to miss our interview with Harry Oldfield.

859
00:34:05.646 --> 00:34:07.992
If you haven't seen it yet, it is not to be missed.

860
00:34:07.992 --> 00:34:10.403
Until next time, thanks for watching.

861
00:34:10.403 --> 00:34:15.403
(soothing music)
