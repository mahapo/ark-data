00:00:00.385 --> 00:00:02.885
<v ->As is often the case with many great teachers,</v>

2
00:00:02.885 --> 00:00:05.005
pain is a catalyst for change.

3
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:08.165
Peggy Dubro had a particularly painful start to life,

4
00:00:08.165 --> 00:00:10.965
which resulted in breaking open to the greater field

5
00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:12.505
of possibilities.

6
00:00:12.505 --> 00:00:15.005
In a state of awareness of all things,

7
00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:17.285
the nature of the universal and human lattice

8
00:00:17.285 --> 00:00:18.785
was revealed to her.

9
00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:21.585
Today, Peggy teaches thousands of people

10
00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:25.745
her EMF balancing technique in countries all over the world.

11
00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:28.665
She has found that we must understand the human lattice

12
00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:30.545
to evolve into the new human being

13
00:00:30.545 --> 00:00:33.435
that we are all being challenged to become.

14
00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:44.065
<v Regina>It's an interesting conundrum</v>

15
00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:46.545
that we as multi-dimensional beings

16
00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:50.825
for the most part, with a few exceptions on this planet,

17
00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:53.045
are driving around, walking around,

18
00:00:53.045 --> 00:00:55.465
bumping through our lives with absolutely no awareness

19
00:00:55.465 --> 00:00:57.765
of our connection with the greater source,

20
00:00:57.765 --> 00:01:02.625
with literally cosmic forces with each other and so forth.

21
00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:05.925
And you obviously came into this life to change all of that

22
00:01:05.925 --> 00:01:08.865
and your work is absolutely beautiful.

23
00:01:08.865 --> 00:01:10.865
But it started when you were quite young.

24
00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:12.505
It wasn't new for you.

25
00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:13.545
Can you talk a little bit,

26
00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:16.105
just share with us a little bit of your history

27
00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:19.325
as to how this began for you

28
00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:20.805
in terms of your understanding of energy

29
00:01:20.805 --> 00:01:22.175
and recognition of it.

30
00:01:23.405 --> 00:01:26.025
<v ->When I was very young, I was very religious.</v>

31
00:01:26.025 --> 00:01:28.105
And I always had this connection with

32
00:01:28.105 --> 00:01:29.565
what I understood as God.

33
00:01:29.565 --> 00:01:32.165
When I was young, because of the religious background,

34
00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:34.445
I saw God as Father.

35
00:01:34.445 --> 00:01:38.145
When I turned 22, something started to happen.

36
00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:41.385
I'd always had sight, but my sight started to change

37
00:01:41.385 --> 00:01:45.485
and the way I felt inside, the passion, the desire

38
00:01:45.485 --> 00:01:48.855
to know creator grew even more.

39
00:01:50.105 --> 00:01:52.825
I didn't know anything about chakras.

40
00:01:52.825 --> 00:01:56.225
I didn't know anything about mantras,

41
00:01:56.225 --> 00:01:59.985
and yet I had this deep desire to remember creator.

42
00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:03.025
The only thing I was doing at that time,

43
00:02:03.025 --> 00:02:06.245
the only thing, perhaps the women will relate to this,

44
00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:08.925
is I was belly dancing at that time.

45
00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:12.505
For exercise, and just because I really loved doing it,

46
00:02:12.505 --> 00:02:15.535
and the dance of the seven veils really intrigued me.

47
00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:18.845
When I was 22, without drugs or alcohol,

48
00:02:18.845 --> 00:02:21.745
it was the end of the 70s, the beginning of the 80s,

49
00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:25.825
I had my first experience of what I call

50
00:02:25.825 --> 00:02:27.505
no beginning and no end.

51
00:02:27.505 --> 00:02:30.325
And what happened was I started to really focus

52
00:02:30.325 --> 00:02:32.705
that I wanted to remember God,

53
00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:36.025
because I knew that that connection was in there,

54
00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:37.945
but I wasn't remembering it,

55
00:02:37.945 --> 00:02:40.725
I wasn't experiencing it in my daily life,

56
00:02:40.725 --> 00:02:42.645
and I knew there was so much more.

57
00:02:42.645 --> 00:02:44.245
<v Regina>Though you were very feeling as a child,</v>

58
00:02:44.245 --> 00:02:46.265
you had some experiences that were quite harsh,

59
00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:47.605
even in your very young life,

60
00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:49.245
where you were alerted to energetic patterns

61
00:02:49.245 --> 00:02:51.245
that were wrong and took bold moves,

62
00:02:51.245 --> 00:02:53.495
and very brave moves for a little girl.

63
00:02:53.745 --> 00:02:55.245
<v ->Very interesting.</v>

64
00:02:55.245 --> 00:02:58.825
You're speaking of the time I did speak about.

65
00:02:58.825 --> 00:03:00.425
When I was very little, my father

66
00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:03.605
was a paranoid schizophrenic alcoholic in the 50s,

67
00:03:03.605 --> 00:03:05.785
in a time when you didn't talk about that.

68
00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:10.380
My childhood is one where I was beat, starved, and abused,

69
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.320
and so were my brother and my sister,

70
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.940
and we managed to make it through that time,

71
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.265
and coming out of that, I think that was also,

72
00:03:20.265 --> 00:03:22.585
people talk about the ego exercises

73
00:03:22.585 --> 00:03:24.305
to release one's ego.

74
00:03:24.305 --> 00:03:25.965
I believe that what that did,

75
00:03:25.965 --> 00:03:27.545
and in this moment that I'm speaking with you,

76
00:03:27.545 --> 00:03:29.125
I'm really experiencing it.

77
00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:33.765
It plowed the field, metaphorically, it plowed the field

78
00:03:33.765 --> 00:03:35.305
so that I could be open.

79
00:03:35.305 --> 00:03:37.205
And isn't it interesting that I was looking

80
00:03:37.205 --> 00:03:39.365
to remember God as Father,

81
00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:42.025
and what I had figured out was that

82
00:03:42.025 --> 00:03:44.585
if God were my father, there was another time

83
00:03:44.585 --> 00:03:45.905
that I was even closer,

84
00:03:45.905 --> 00:03:48.065
and this is before I studied anything.

85
00:03:48.065 --> 00:03:49.825
I start to understand Buddhism,

86
00:03:49.825 --> 00:03:51.645
or I start to understand the Siddha Yoga,

87
00:03:51.645 --> 00:03:53.126
or any of these things,

88
00:03:53.126 --> 00:03:55.825
the traditional ways of the indigenous people.

89
00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:57.830
This was just in my own growing up.

90
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.415
<v Regina>Why do you think you chose</v>

91
00:03:59.415 --> 00:04:00.896
that particular incarnation path

92
00:04:00.896 --> 00:04:02.736
with that particular father?

93
00:04:02.736 --> 00:04:04.136
I mean, did you already just answer it,

94
00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:06.336
or have you learned more since then?

95
00:04:06.336 --> 00:04:07.436
<v ->That is interesting.</v>

96
00:04:07.436 --> 00:04:09.576
I've come to the point that I understand

97
00:04:09.576 --> 00:04:12.256
that my father played that role for me,

98
00:04:12.256 --> 00:04:14.316
and in agreement of our souls,

99
00:04:14.316 --> 00:04:16.336
I played that role for him.

100
00:04:16.336 --> 00:04:18.396
And what I know is that

101
00:04:18.396 --> 00:04:21.916
because the energy is the way it is now,

102
00:04:21.916 --> 00:04:24.696
he will never have to play that role for me again,

103
00:04:24.696 --> 00:04:27.056
I will never have to play that role for him.

104
00:04:27.056 --> 00:04:30.196
People call it forgiveness.

105
00:04:30.196 --> 00:04:34.077
When you start to understand everything as energy patterns,

106
00:04:34.077 --> 00:04:37.297
and it's a dance of energy that we have with one another,

107
00:04:37.297 --> 00:04:39.977
you learn not to take things so personally.

108
00:04:39.977 --> 00:04:43.917
When you also understand that everything is for lesson,

109
00:04:43.917 --> 00:04:46.617
and how do you know that this is your lesson?

110
00:04:46.617 --> 00:04:48.497
It's because you're having it.

111
00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:52.297
So for me, it just is now part of my reality,

112
00:04:52.297 --> 00:04:54.017
and I'm very much at peace with that,

113
00:04:54.017 --> 00:04:55.797
so I don't feel that there's that tie

114
00:04:55.797 --> 00:04:59.167
that it would have to be done again.

115
00:04:59.517 --> 00:05:02.677
<v Regina>So, nonetheless, you stood up for yourself</v>

116
00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:05.037
because you did recognize energetic patterns.

117
00:05:05.037 --> 00:05:07.437
And then you had this desire to get into your body

118
00:05:07.437 --> 00:05:09.657
and incorporate something you weren't even aware of

119
00:05:09.657 --> 00:05:11.497
via belly dancing.

120
00:05:11.497 --> 00:05:14.817
And then you went on a search through many traditions,

121
00:05:14.817 --> 00:05:16.697
as you alluded to a moment ago.

122
00:05:16.697 --> 00:05:18.517
What happened during that journey

123
00:05:18.517 --> 00:05:20.967
when you were studying all these

124
00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:23.927
different forms of spiritual awareness?

125
00:05:23.927 --> 00:05:26.367
What did it take before it finally hit you

126
00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:29.587
that I've got it, instead of just being the seeker?

127
00:05:29.587 --> 00:05:31.187
And you talk about this a fair amount.

128
00:05:31.187 --> 00:05:34.507
<v ->Yes, the first experience I had of no beginning</v>

129
00:05:34.507 --> 00:05:36.307
and no end, I was 22.

130
00:05:36.307 --> 00:05:39.967
Literally I had started to say, I remember, I remember.

131
00:05:39.967 --> 00:05:41.327
So now based on everything we said,

132
00:05:41.327 --> 00:05:43.967
I'm wanting to remember God the Father,

133
00:05:43.967 --> 00:05:46.047
and that comes from my religious tradition.

134
00:05:46.047 --> 00:05:49.847
And I have this memory, and my sight for energy

135
00:05:49.847 --> 00:05:54.747
had really grown and it came in this light

136
00:05:54.747 --> 00:05:56.587
and this energy, it looked almost like

137
00:05:56.587 --> 00:05:57.627
the movie Contact.

138
00:05:57.627 --> 00:06:00.065
I started to see this blue light in front of me,

139
00:06:00.065 --> 00:06:02.045
and I remember at first I was afraid of it,

140
00:06:02.045 --> 00:06:03.705
I thought what is this?

141
00:06:03.705 --> 00:06:05.685
And then I remember touching it and feeling it.

142
00:06:05.685 --> 00:06:07.425
It was electrical and alive,

143
00:06:07.425 --> 00:06:10.365
and it was an energy of intelligence.

144
00:06:10.365 --> 00:06:12.565
When I finally was able to communicate with it,

145
00:06:12.565 --> 00:06:15.045
this light and this energy,

146
00:06:15.045 --> 00:06:17.255
which would be part of my own being,

147
00:06:17.255 --> 00:06:20.132
took me to another place in my consciousness

148
00:06:20.132 --> 00:06:23.932
where all connections to all things were felt.

149
00:06:23.932 --> 00:06:26.852
Like there was just a minimal contact in my own being

150
00:06:26.852 --> 00:06:30.712
so that I could experience this no beginning and no end.

151
00:06:30.712 --> 00:06:33.932
That was amazing experience,

152
00:06:33.932 --> 00:06:37.852
but what was even more amazing was,

153
00:06:37.852 --> 00:06:39.672
here I'm looking for this father energy...

154
00:06:39.672 --> 00:06:41.512
<v Regina>God, the Father, did Mother show up?</v>

155
00:06:41.512 --> 00:06:43.392
<v ->Yes, and in comes, you're right,</v>

156
00:06:43.392 --> 00:06:47.132
in comes all this beautiful love, God the Mother.

157
00:06:47.132 --> 00:06:51.872
And all this beautiful love just changed my life.

158
00:06:51.872 --> 00:06:54.632
This experience lasted, for me, an entire night

159
00:06:54.632 --> 00:06:56.212
and completely changed my life.

160
00:06:56.212 --> 00:06:59.572
In the next day and days thereafter,

161
00:06:59.572 --> 00:07:02.492
I was just, my eyes were popping out of my head,

162
00:07:02.492 --> 00:07:04.392
I'm telling people, God is real.

163
00:07:04.392 --> 00:07:06.132
People are looking at me kind of funny,

164
00:07:06.132 --> 00:07:07.072
which rightfully so.

165
00:07:07.072 --> 00:07:08.932
<v Regina>It doesn't have a big, great beard either.</v>

166
00:07:08.932 --> 00:07:11.612
<v ->No, no beard, and not only that,</v>

167
00:07:11.612 --> 00:07:13.932
what really got to me was that

168
00:07:13.932 --> 00:07:17.092
God, Creator loves each and every one of us.

169
00:07:17.092 --> 00:07:19.592
What had happened for me,

170
00:07:19.592 --> 00:07:22.992
in society, I was considered low class,

171
00:07:22.992 --> 00:07:24.712
I was considered low level,

172
00:07:24.712 --> 00:07:27.432
I was considered damaged goods,

173
00:07:27.432 --> 00:07:29.492
and why would God speak to you?

174
00:07:29.492 --> 00:07:31.152
That didn't even bother me.

175
00:07:31.152 --> 00:07:35.092
What was amazing to me was to find this unbelievable love,

176
00:07:35.092 --> 00:07:38.792
and it was transformative, it was life changing.

177
00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:41.552
And then you talked about the seeking.

178
00:07:41.552 --> 00:07:43.412
That was 15 years.

179
00:07:43.412 --> 00:07:45.452
What happened for me, I wanted

180
00:07:45.452 --> 00:07:50.032
to have that energy, that mother father energy

181
00:07:50.032 --> 00:07:52.992
in my consciousness all the time.

182
00:07:52.992 --> 00:07:55.393
And at that time, so this is like 30 years ago or so,

183
00:07:55.393 --> 00:07:58.313
actually even longer, it's like 34 years ago,

184
00:07:58.313 --> 00:08:01.333
and there aren't New Age magazines,

185
00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:03.433
there aren't all these places you can go to

186
00:08:03.433 --> 00:08:04.493
to understand more.

187
00:08:04.493 --> 00:08:07.753
And my very first teacher said to me,

188
00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:08.993
you cannot keep that consciousness

189
00:08:08.993 --> 00:08:11.693
or you will go crazy.

190
00:08:11.693 --> 00:08:13.673
Perhaps I will even say this,

191
00:08:13.673 --> 00:08:15.673
and we'll put it on film for the first time,

192
00:08:15.673 --> 00:08:17.693
it was something else this teacher said to me.

193
00:08:17.693 --> 00:08:19.913
When I talked about this exquisite love,

194
00:08:19.913 --> 00:08:24.473
she said to me, Peggy, to be in that consciousness

195
00:08:24.473 --> 00:08:27.173
would be like being in orgasm all the time.

196
00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:29.233
And she says to me, and do you want that?

197
00:08:29.233 --> 00:08:32.993
And I'm thinking, well, this is not a bad idea.

198
00:08:32.993 --> 00:08:34.193
So it's like...

199
00:08:34.193 --> 00:08:38.233
And in that time, I think what she was saying was true.

200
00:08:38.233 --> 00:08:41.733
That we were not ready, humanity was still evolving,

201
00:08:41.733 --> 00:08:44.453
and so in my own personal way, I was evolving too,

202
00:08:44.453 --> 00:08:47.073
and so 15 years of study...

203
00:08:47.073 --> 00:08:49.973
I went to born again Christianity, surprisingly enough.

204
00:08:49.973 --> 00:08:51.413
<v Regina>Interesting, after that?</v>

205
00:08:51.413 --> 00:08:52.793
<v ->Right after that I went.</v>

206
00:08:52.793 --> 00:08:55.513
Laying on of hands, speaking in tongues, the whole...

207
00:08:55.513 --> 00:08:59.273
Then I, uh, Zen Buddhism, Siddha Yoga,

208
00:08:59.273 --> 00:09:01.053
continued with the belly dancing,

209
00:09:01.053 --> 00:09:02.373
but then moved into,

210
00:09:02.373 --> 00:09:05.273
I studied tae kwon do, I studied kung fu,

211
00:09:05.273 --> 00:09:08.753
I did many, many different forms of learning.

212
00:09:08.753 --> 00:09:11.153
What I knew in my heart of hearts,

213
00:09:11.153 --> 00:09:12.613
in my soul of souls, was that

214
00:09:12.613 --> 00:09:14.513
I could have that experience again,

215
00:09:14.513 --> 00:09:16.933
and I had vowed that when that happened,

216
00:09:16.933 --> 00:09:20.873
I was going to learn how to hold that experience.

217
00:09:20.873 --> 00:09:22.553
Now as a metaphysician, people will say

218
00:09:22.553 --> 00:09:24.133
you can't hold unlimited,

219
00:09:24.133 --> 00:09:25.533
and I understand that,

220
00:09:25.533 --> 00:09:28.313
but there was a consciousness, there's a place,

221
00:09:28.313 --> 00:09:32.093
that I knew I could do that in some way.

222
00:09:32.093 --> 00:09:36.273
And sure enough, 15 years later,

223
00:09:36.273 --> 00:09:39.313
I had the second experience of no beginning and no end.

224
00:09:39.313 --> 00:09:42.393
And this time, it's feminine energy present,

225
00:09:42.393 --> 00:09:45.493
and the experience, and again,

226
00:09:45.493 --> 00:09:48.113
this is just, it is a conscious awareness.

227
00:09:48.113 --> 00:09:49.993
It's a good thing I hadn't done chemicals

228
00:09:49.993 --> 00:09:51.973
and I'm not criticizing.

229
00:09:51.973 --> 00:09:54.013
Those that did the chemicals of the 60s,

230
00:09:54.013 --> 00:09:57.593
they did it because we needed to push back the consciousness

231
00:09:57.593 --> 00:09:59.833
and I'm glad I didn't because my brain,

232
00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:01.453
I don't know how it functions,

233
00:10:01.453 --> 00:10:03.693
but I would, I was constantly having,

234
00:10:03.693 --> 00:10:05.673
before the second experience,

235
00:10:05.673 --> 00:10:07.673
many many different experiences.

236
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.031
All energy coming in, beings of light.

237
00:10:10.031 --> 00:10:13.111
Indeed, you could say I'm crazy.

238
00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:15.370
Fine, I imagined it, fine, whatever.

239
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:19.290
All I know is my reality includes

240
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.650
all of these different levels of awareness.

241
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.711
And what I looked at my life though,

242
00:10:24.711 --> 00:10:27.690
with all of this empowered energy coming in,

243
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.411
I wasn't able to focus it,

244
00:10:29.411 --> 00:10:31.250
I wasn't able to work with it,

245
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.290
and my life reflected a lot of confusion.

246
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.231
I could barely make my bed, if that got done.

247
00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:40.970
So the second experience of no beginning and no end,

248
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:45.211
now I actually, and this is my experience.

249
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:47.670
There is this female form of light

250
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.610
who merges completely with me.

251
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.111
She comes in on this beautiful white horse of light,

252
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:53.831
so there's the imagery.

253
00:10:53.831 --> 00:10:56.231
And as she merges with me,

254
00:10:56.231 --> 00:10:58.450
my arms literally start to go up,

255
00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:03.130
and I literally become this pattern, this energy pattern

256
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.090
which we now call the Universal Calibration Lattice.

257
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.891
It was an initiation into an awareness

258
00:11:09.891 --> 00:11:13.290
of this system in my energy anatomy.

259
00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.218
Once that happened, it was very interesting,

260
00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:19.518
and it's been a long time since I've thought about this,

261
00:11:19.518 --> 00:11:21.117
but I thought of it the other day,

262
00:11:21.117 --> 00:11:22.458
for other reasons I'll tell you

263
00:11:22.458 --> 00:11:26.817
because I'm getting all the signs of the third experience.

264
00:11:26.817 --> 00:11:30.377
But the second experience is very interesting

265
00:11:30.377 --> 00:11:33.897
because I woke up, or brought myself back to consciousness

266
00:11:33.897 --> 00:11:35.637
you would say, I was in this suspended state,

267
00:11:35.637 --> 00:11:37.998
in very, very vivid dreaming and I knew I was dreaming,

268
00:11:37.998 --> 00:11:42.198
and once this pattern was here,

269
00:11:42.198 --> 00:11:45.198
I opened my eyes, and I had to wait

270
00:11:45.198 --> 00:11:48.497
until every last bit of the energy had,

271
00:11:48.497 --> 00:11:52.277
it felt like it was being absorbed, coming inside.

272
00:11:52.277 --> 00:11:54.678
Once it was inside, then I couldn't move.

273
00:11:54.678 --> 00:11:56.557
I could not even move.

274
00:11:56.557 --> 00:11:58.338
And then I sat up and I thought,

275
00:11:58.338 --> 00:12:01.217
my god, I want someone to sing happy birthday to me.

276
00:12:01.217 --> 00:12:03.148
(laughs)

277
00:12:05.497 --> 00:12:07.857
I thought that was, I hadn't remembered these details

278
00:12:07.857 --> 00:12:09.477
until a few days ago.

279
00:12:09.477 --> 00:12:10.877
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

280
00:12:10.877 --> 00:12:13.777
Well we're going to go into the work itself,

281
00:12:13.777 --> 00:12:15.997
but can you continue on this vein for a moment?

282
00:12:15.997 --> 00:12:20.237
What do you feel mounting that's coming together now,

283
00:12:20.237 --> 00:12:21.838
and why, you told me off camera,

284
00:12:21.838 --> 00:12:24.557
you've gone through a lot of changes very recently.

285
00:12:24.557 --> 00:12:25.997
What's going on?

286
00:12:28.887 --> 00:12:33.128
<v ->There's, I'm peeking into the other realities again</v>

287
00:12:33.128 --> 00:12:35.388
more and more.

288
00:12:35.388 --> 00:12:38.668
I'm seeing the changes, only this time,

289
00:12:38.668 --> 00:12:42.428
as I prepare for this third no beginning and no end,

290
00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:44.408
and I've always said I knew I would have it again,

291
00:12:44.408 --> 00:12:46.608
and I also knew I would have company.

292
00:12:46.608 --> 00:12:48.048
There's a collective.

293
00:12:48.048 --> 00:12:50.269
All of us are growing.

294
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:52.169
All of us are becoming more aware.

295
00:12:52.169 --> 00:12:57.169
For myself personally, I've recently released 32, 33 pounds.

296
00:12:57.368 --> 00:12:59.339
I'll continue to go.

297
00:13:00.719 --> 00:13:02.619
I've always eaten good food, it's eating less.

298
00:13:02.619 --> 00:13:05.500
But what's happening is I'm strengthening my physical body.

299
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.659
I'm up to about an hour of some strong physical exercise,

300
00:13:09.659 --> 00:13:11.580
and I know why.

301
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.399
It's for the electrical current to come with this next,

302
00:13:15.399 --> 00:13:16.960
with this next event.

303
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.579
I'm completing the EMF balancing technique.

304
00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:22.380
It has 12 phases to it now.

305
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.306
I will be teaching phases 9 through 12

306
00:13:25.306 --> 00:13:27.585
for the first time in June of this year.

307
00:13:27.585 --> 00:13:30.665
I'll have a class of people from over 30 countries.

308
00:13:30.665 --> 00:13:33.886
That's the testament to the bridging of this work

309
00:13:33.886 --> 00:13:36.545
inside of ourselves and with others.

310
00:13:36.545 --> 00:13:39.745
And there's a phase 13 that will be anchored

311
00:13:39.745 --> 00:13:42.745
by the middle of 2009.

312
00:13:44.265 --> 00:13:48.968
I'm so mindful of my own personal growth,

313
00:13:48.968 --> 00:13:53.608
and I'm so mindful of the collective personal growth,

314
00:13:53.608 --> 00:13:57.668
and that together, for everyone, it's their personal growth

315
00:13:57.668 --> 00:13:59.368
and what's happening with the collective

316
00:13:59.368 --> 00:14:01.988
that will facilitate our next step.

317
00:14:01.988 --> 00:14:04.048
And for me it's that experience.

318
00:14:04.968 --> 00:14:07.173
<v Regina>And you pointed to something a moment ago</v>

319
00:14:07.173 --> 00:14:11.213
that I'm getting the same understanding and impulses,

320
00:14:11.213 --> 00:14:13.934
that it's becoming very important to strengthen

321
00:14:13.934 --> 00:14:15.854
the physical now.

322
00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:18.933
Would you go ahead and talk about your observation

323
00:14:18.933 --> 00:14:21.643
and understanding of why this is?

324
00:14:25.873 --> 00:14:29.773
<v ->I've always said, when I talk about the Lattice,</v>

325
00:14:29.773 --> 00:14:32.553
that it's a rewiring for the energy.

326
00:14:32.553 --> 00:14:34.854
As a matter of fact, sometimes I think my next book

327
00:14:34.854 --> 00:14:37.914
should say, wonderfully weird, or is it wired,

328
00:14:37.914 --> 00:14:42.094
so that we can understand ourselves a bit more.

329
00:14:43.464 --> 00:14:45.753
When I travel and I go overseas,

330
00:14:45.753 --> 00:14:50.313
if I use a curling iron, up until recent years,

331
00:14:50.313 --> 00:14:54.133
I always had to have a little box, a transformer,

332
00:14:54.133 --> 00:14:58.253
so I could plug in my appliance so it wouldn't burn out.

333
00:14:58.253 --> 00:15:00.393
A transformer box.

334
00:15:00.393 --> 00:15:03.273
The Lattice to me, is that transformer box.

335
00:15:03.273 --> 00:15:05.853
There's been a collective consciousness all around,

336
00:15:05.853 --> 00:15:07.533
what's interesting, just as aside,

337
00:15:07.533 --> 00:15:09.733
these appliances now come with dual,

338
00:15:09.733 --> 00:15:12.074
so that you can plug them in all over the world,

339
00:15:12.074 --> 00:15:14.393
which is to me, that was an evolutionary leap

340
00:15:14.393 --> 00:15:18.153
reflected even in something so simple as curling one's hair.

341
00:15:18.153 --> 00:15:22.493
So I look at this, and what I'm seeing is that

342
00:15:22.493 --> 00:15:27.154
this is not visualization, what's coming next.

343
00:15:27.154 --> 00:15:29.194
No mistake, someone like Oprah Winfrey

344
00:15:29.194 --> 00:15:33.373
has an Eckhart Tolle soul talking about new world.

345
00:15:33.373 --> 00:15:34.774
You bet.

346
00:15:34.774 --> 00:15:37.174
But with that new world, it's new human.

347
00:15:37.174 --> 00:15:40.073
And the energy of the world is changing,

348
00:15:40.073 --> 00:15:42.673
we've been busy working, working working.

349
00:15:42.673 --> 00:15:45.813
For me, there's a bridge of grace, I believe,

350
00:15:45.813 --> 00:15:49.233
that we can create, and that was my fervent prayer.

351
00:15:49.233 --> 00:15:52.293
I saw indeed that there would be energy of change,

352
00:15:52.293 --> 00:15:55.053
like everyone else, the problems on the planet,

353
00:15:55.053 --> 00:15:58.413
where we're still at with the conflicts,

354
00:15:58.413 --> 00:16:00.574
but I also saw that there's an overlapping

355
00:16:00.574 --> 00:16:02.553
where we're creating grace.

356
00:16:02.553 --> 00:16:07.553
But to do that calls for a health, a centeredness.

357
00:16:08.373 --> 00:16:12.133
This energy is not visualized, it's not meditated in,

358
00:16:12.133 --> 00:16:15.133
it's not something that's in that imagination.

359
00:16:15.133 --> 00:16:19.914
The energy is alive, it's electrical, and it's powerful.

360
00:16:19.914 --> 00:16:23.294
And so to be able to work with this energy,

361
00:16:23.294 --> 00:16:26.874
to be a conduit of this energy of wholeness,

362
00:16:26.874 --> 00:16:29.373
or what I like to call holiness,

363
00:16:29.373 --> 00:16:31.874
it requires that we pay attention to the...

364
00:16:31.874 --> 00:16:34.874
We're still carbon, chemical, electrical light beings.

365
00:16:34.874 --> 00:16:36.753
We're still in physical body.

366
00:16:36.753 --> 00:16:38.753
So to take care of that body,

367
00:16:38.753 --> 00:16:42.114
because the ascension process is not us leaving,

368
00:16:42.114 --> 00:16:45.513
the ascension process is within the body.

369
00:16:45.513 --> 00:16:49.573
So it's getting that body in a really strong state.

370
00:16:49.573 --> 00:16:52.914
My body is stronger than it's been in the past 20 years.

371
00:16:52.914 --> 00:16:55.673
<v Regina>Wonderful, you look radiant with health.</v>

372
00:16:55.673 --> 00:16:57.973
This is obvious.

373
00:16:57.973 --> 00:17:01.933
Okay, that said, now let's go in through another track

374
00:17:01.933 --> 00:17:03.733
if you don't mind, because one of the things

375
00:17:03.733 --> 00:17:06.294
I was reading in there is that this lattice

376
00:17:06.294 --> 00:17:09.393
that surrounds all of us, this universal lattice

377
00:17:09.393 --> 00:17:12.834
that surrounds us, is by extension,

378
00:17:12.834 --> 00:17:16.813
interacting with our nervous system.

379
00:17:16.813 --> 00:17:20.633
Sympathetic, parasympathetic nervous systems.

380
00:17:20.633 --> 00:17:22.733
So can we enter from that point

381
00:17:22.733 --> 00:17:25.913
and you can begin telling us about the lattice,

382
00:17:25.913 --> 00:17:28.793
about our personal lattice, and how this lattice

383
00:17:28.793 --> 00:17:32.803
begins interfacing with the cosmic lattice.

384
00:17:34.093 --> 00:17:36.613
<v ->The lattice actually is an extension, as you said,</v>

385
00:17:36.613 --> 00:17:39.733
of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.

386
00:17:39.733 --> 00:17:42.734
It radiates through the chakra system.

387
00:17:42.734 --> 00:17:45.853
There are a few other centers that we work with,

388
00:17:45.853 --> 00:17:48.214
the center below, the center at the knees,

389
00:17:48.214 --> 00:17:50.274
the high heart, the center above.

390
00:17:50.274 --> 00:17:53.913
There's actually 12 points of universal balance.

391
00:17:53.913 --> 00:17:56.533
As we become universal humans,

392
00:17:56.533 --> 00:17:58.653
the energy system has changed.

393
00:17:58.653 --> 00:18:02.953
So understanding this system in the energy anatomy

394
00:18:02.953 --> 00:18:07.953
will help people also take greater charge of their evolution

395
00:18:08.393 --> 00:18:11.813
and by that I mean, how does this function?

396
00:18:11.813 --> 00:18:15.954
Our emotions, our words, our thoughts, our actions.

397
00:18:15.954 --> 00:18:19.113
Those are all energy charges.

398
00:18:19.113 --> 00:18:24.113
So this lattice facilitates our ability to learn

399
00:18:24.793 --> 00:18:29.194
how to move the energy charges through our field

400
00:18:29.194 --> 00:18:33.854
so that we are in a centered, balanced, energetic

401
00:18:33.854 --> 00:18:35.713
posture of wholeness.

402
00:18:35.713 --> 00:18:38.674
And that is an everyday calibration

403
00:18:38.674 --> 00:18:41.474
because the energies here are constantly changing,

404
00:18:41.474 --> 00:18:44.153
and we're a part of that change.

405
00:18:44.153 --> 00:18:46.093
Now I'm not sure if I answered that question

406
00:18:46.093 --> 00:18:48.053
because I was taking into consideration

407
00:18:48.053 --> 00:18:49.393
everything we've just said.

408
00:18:49.393 --> 00:18:51.054
<v Regina>No, I think you have.</v>

409
00:18:51.054 --> 00:18:53.454
And another thing you talk about is

410
00:18:53.454 --> 00:18:56.714
our story, our personal story.

411
00:18:56.714 --> 00:18:59.474
Now how does our personal story and awareness

412
00:18:59.474 --> 00:19:04.221
of our deep past, our present, perhaps our future,

413
00:19:04.221 --> 00:19:07.741
how does that figure into the lattice work

414
00:19:07.741 --> 00:19:09.692
and the work you do?

415
00:19:10.841 --> 00:19:14.582
<v ->When people understand this lattice, this framework,</v>

416
00:19:14.582 --> 00:19:17.621
they will be able to be more present in their core.

417
00:19:17.621 --> 00:19:20.457
And when they look at the energy of their history

418
00:19:20.457 --> 00:19:23.007
or "herstory," their story,

419
00:19:23.007 --> 00:19:26.288
when they look at that energy, there are charges

420
00:19:26.288 --> 00:19:30.208
that keep certain patterns alive.

421
00:19:30.208 --> 00:19:31.968
And it's an energy charge.

422
00:19:31.968 --> 00:19:34.448
And when a certain pattern makes us smile a lot,

423
00:19:34.448 --> 00:19:36.587
we say that's a positive energy.

424
00:19:36.587 --> 00:19:39.207
And when a pattern makes us frown a lot,

425
00:19:39.207 --> 00:19:40.767
or we're not very happy about it,

426
00:19:40.767 --> 00:19:42.927
we say that's a negative energy.

427
00:19:42.927 --> 00:19:45.248
It really isn't positive or negative,

428
00:19:45.248 --> 00:19:48.687
it's the energy charge that we put around a situation

429
00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:52.647
that keeps it alive and working through our life.

430
00:19:52.647 --> 00:19:54.688
And through the lattice, you can start to understand

431
00:19:54.688 --> 00:19:57.888
how to release those charges very quickly

432
00:19:57.888 --> 00:20:01.588
without necessarily going through the original insult.

433
00:20:01.588 --> 00:20:03.928
And this particular work, while I'm saying that,

434
00:20:03.928 --> 00:20:06.628
it is not a work of catharsis.

435
00:20:06.628 --> 00:20:08.907
They're rebirthing for release,

436
00:20:08.907 --> 00:20:11.648
and there's just many beautiful works out there

437
00:20:11.648 --> 00:20:14.907
that will help when someone feels that they need to do that.

438
00:20:14.907 --> 00:20:18.967
This particular work is about learning to sense your lattice

439
00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:20.207
and I'm doing this a lot,

440
00:20:20.207 --> 00:20:23.387
we do use tai chi-like hand movements

441
00:20:23.387 --> 00:20:25.867
when we work with ourselves and with others,

442
00:20:25.867 --> 00:20:28.527
and this is for centering, they're beautiful movements.

443
00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:33.147
And learning how to move the energy charges

444
00:20:33.147 --> 00:20:35.707
from those things that no longer serve us

445
00:20:35.707 --> 00:20:38.767
and to activate in our history or our story,

446
00:20:38.767 --> 00:20:40.707
something that people often forget about

447
00:20:40.707 --> 00:20:42.628
is that we have goodies in our history,

448
00:20:42.628 --> 00:20:45.007
no matter what your history was.

449
00:20:45.007 --> 00:20:47.728
And I shared earlier my history.

450
00:20:47.728 --> 00:20:49.787
There are goodies there,

451
00:20:49.787 --> 00:20:51.447
and there are latent talents

452
00:20:51.447 --> 00:20:54.127
and hidden abilities yet to be activated,

453
00:20:54.127 --> 00:20:56.927
so it's learning how to consciously move

454
00:20:56.927 --> 00:20:59.767
the energetic charges of one's being

455
00:20:59.767 --> 00:21:02.847
to create focus and life for certain patterns

456
00:21:02.847 --> 00:21:04.527
that are already within us.

457
00:21:04.527 --> 00:21:09.128
The lattice becomes like this beautiful focusing framework,

458
00:21:09.128 --> 00:21:12.608
and it makes it much easier to work these charges.

459
00:21:12.608 --> 00:21:14.567
It encourages the evolution.

460
00:21:14.567 --> 00:21:17.907
We say we take responsibility for ourselves,

461
00:21:17.907 --> 00:21:20.007
and we work very hard at doing that.

462
00:21:20.007 --> 00:21:22.888
This is a tool that will help support you in doing it.

463
00:21:22.888 --> 00:21:24.847
And why is it so important to be moving

464
00:21:24.847 --> 00:21:26.888
the energy charges around?

465
00:21:26.888 --> 00:21:31.407
The whole theory is that you are constantly,

466
00:21:31.407 --> 00:21:35.168
constantly communicating with the universe through energy.

467
00:21:35.168 --> 00:21:38.168
Through speaking the language of energy.

468
00:21:38.168 --> 00:21:41.447
And so the energy pattern that you are

469
00:21:41.447 --> 00:21:42.887
sends off a message.

470
00:21:42.887 --> 00:21:45.087
Move the energy patterns around.

471
00:21:45.087 --> 00:21:49.167
Become clear first inside here, who you are in the moment,

472
00:21:49.167 --> 00:21:51.028
and we're always redefining that,

473
00:21:51.028 --> 00:21:53.567
and then you become more clear

474
00:21:53.567 --> 00:21:56.127
with what you're communicating out there.

475
00:21:56.127 --> 00:21:59.148
And that's been, I think one of the biggest challenges

476
00:21:59.148 --> 00:22:01.648
right now is people are becoming so sensitive,

477
00:22:01.648 --> 00:22:04.127
those that are aware, and even those that aren't,

478
00:22:04.127 --> 00:22:06.297
they're wondering what's going on,

479
00:22:06.297 --> 00:22:09.188
but something is happening inside,

480
00:22:09.188 --> 00:22:12.743
and it creates a lot of confusion for people,

481
00:22:12.743 --> 00:22:14.784
and this way it helps to clarify.

482
00:22:14.784 --> 00:22:16.403
And then we get to my favorite,

483
00:22:16.403 --> 00:22:18.483
the energy of potential.

484
00:22:18.483 --> 00:22:21.184
Because I need people with really good hearts,

485
00:22:21.184 --> 00:22:24.663
with wonderful ideas, with beautiful energy

486
00:22:24.663 --> 00:22:26.063
to manifest here.

487
00:22:26.063 --> 00:22:29.703
But they get in their way,

488
00:22:29.703 --> 00:22:33.223
and this becomes, dare I say it,

489
00:22:33.223 --> 00:22:35.823
somebody had to say it, this is going in the next book.

490
00:22:35.823 --> 00:22:38.023
This is an organizational tool,

491
00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:41.263
and organizing is my hobby.

492
00:22:41.263 --> 00:22:46.263
It's an organizational tool because there is so much.

493
00:22:46.443 --> 00:22:47.983
We are building bridges.

494
00:22:47.983 --> 00:22:50.644
You'd better believe those veils of consciousness,

495
00:22:50.644 --> 00:22:51.723
they're thinning.

496
00:22:51.723 --> 00:22:54.284
We're becoming more aware of multi-dimensional reality.

497
00:22:54.284 --> 00:22:58.084
Science and quantum physics, it's becoming a foundation.

498
00:22:58.084 --> 00:23:00.023
We're moving from a Newtonian understanding,

499
00:23:00.023 --> 00:23:02.023
embracing more of the quantum.

500
00:23:02.023 --> 00:23:03.803
Lots of us who are laypeople,

501
00:23:03.803 --> 00:23:05.283
who have no idea what we're talking about,

502
00:23:05.283 --> 00:23:06.823
are talking about quantum physics.

503
00:23:06.823 --> 00:23:07.924
<v Regina>Yes, and the danger is</v>

504
00:23:07.924 --> 00:23:10.023
we're walking around in a state of pure chaos

505
00:23:10.023 --> 00:23:11.546
the more sensitive we become,

506
00:23:11.546 --> 00:23:13.945
so that does have to be coherent or organized.

507
00:23:13.945 --> 00:23:16.866
<v ->And in physics, when you make reality,</v>

508
00:23:16.866 --> 00:23:20.765
there is chaos to order to chaos to order.

509
00:23:20.765 --> 00:23:22.266
This is the ongoing.

510
00:23:22.266 --> 00:23:26.645
I'm proposing that this is a time for more order.

511
00:23:26.645 --> 00:23:28.946
And there is great laughter inside my whole being,

512
00:23:28.946 --> 00:23:30.265
and probably throughout the cosmos

513
00:23:30.265 --> 00:23:32.365
because I was never an organized person.

514
00:23:32.365 --> 00:23:34.185
<v Regina>I noticed that in your book.</v>

515
00:23:34.185 --> 00:23:37.425
<v ->(laughs) Until I became aware of the lattice.</v>

516
00:23:37.425 --> 00:23:38.625
And to go back to the lattice,

517
00:23:38.625 --> 00:23:40.346
once I had that experience,

518
00:23:40.346 --> 00:23:42.945
I started to notice this energy,

519
00:23:42.945 --> 00:23:45.665
this lattice, in other people's fields.

520
00:23:45.665 --> 00:23:47.946
And I started to realize that this was a system

521
00:23:47.946 --> 00:23:51.025
in our energy anatomy that was coming online.

522
00:23:51.025 --> 00:23:53.345
And I learned how to work with it.

523
00:23:53.345 --> 00:23:56.285
And then people came and they had experiences,

524
00:23:56.285 --> 00:23:59.585
and the work had all of these beautiful repercussions,

525
00:23:59.585 --> 00:24:01.505
and I couldn't keep people away, actually.

526
00:24:01.505 --> 00:24:03.126
My practice started and I didn't even realize

527
00:24:03.126 --> 00:24:04.465
it was a practice,

528
00:24:04.465 --> 00:24:06.425
and then other people came and they said

529
00:24:06.425 --> 00:24:07.665
can you teach us?

530
00:24:07.665 --> 00:24:09.445
And I never saw myself as a teacher,

531
00:24:09.445 --> 00:24:10.805
and I started teaching.

532
00:24:10.805 --> 00:24:12.405
And now I even have taught people

533
00:24:12.405 --> 00:24:13.606
how to teach this work,

534
00:24:13.606 --> 00:24:15.705
and it's all through understanding us

535
00:24:15.705 --> 00:24:18.385
as energy charges, energy patterns,

536
00:24:18.385 --> 00:24:22.525
and speaking the wordless, the language of energy.

537
00:24:22.525 --> 00:24:25.765
<v Regina>Yes, and so you have been able to help identify,</v>

538
00:24:25.765 --> 00:24:28.826
and I have to say, what I like about your DVDs

539
00:24:28.826 --> 00:24:33.285
is that you actually use animation to show

540
00:24:33.285 --> 00:24:35.925
how the lattice works, how it forms itself,

541
00:24:35.925 --> 00:24:36.885
what it looks like.

542
00:24:36.885 --> 00:24:40.585
I'm visual, so for me that's always helpful

543
00:24:40.585 --> 00:24:42.885
in any modality, any work at all,

544
00:24:42.885 --> 00:24:45.065
I have to be able to see it in my mind's eye.

545
00:24:45.065 --> 00:24:46.886
And whoever did this for you

546
00:24:46.886 --> 00:24:49.385
did a beautiful job on the illustration.

547
00:24:49.385 --> 00:24:52.605
So it's not just a concept, you can see what it looks like,

548
00:24:52.605 --> 00:24:54.926
and that helps begin building it

549
00:24:54.926 --> 00:24:56.805
and working with it in your own right.

550
00:24:56.805 --> 00:24:59.106
Now this might be an off the wall question.

551
00:24:59.106 --> 00:25:02.226
You're working with all the energy centers of the body,

552
00:25:02.226 --> 00:25:04.126
and you speak of love a great deal,

553
00:25:04.126 --> 00:25:06.366
and the heart center is imperative to have open.

554
00:25:06.366 --> 00:25:09.005
This is going to sound really off the wall.

555
00:25:09.005 --> 00:25:14.005
A lot of women on this planet wear bras with wire in them.

556
00:25:17.316 --> 00:25:20.500
I just got intuitively I'm supposed to ask you this.

557
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.390
What happens there?

558
00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.960
<v ->It would be better,</v>

559
00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.380
I switched also, I understand (clears throat)

560
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.960
the wire bra. (laughs)

561
00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.321
There you go, I mean we're getting personal here.

562
00:25:35.321 --> 00:25:36.530
<v Regina>We are getting personal,</v>

563
00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:37.906
but I know that it's important.

564
00:25:37.906 --> 00:25:39.626
I'm feeling that it's important.

565
00:25:39.626 --> 00:25:41.066
That something about the metal

566
00:25:41.066 --> 00:25:43.026
running through these fields constantly.

567
00:25:43.026 --> 00:25:44.766
<v ->Yes, I've switched myself,</v>

568
00:25:44.766 --> 00:25:47.466
and as we're getting ready to head to Russia today,

569
00:25:47.466 --> 00:25:48.606
I'm definitely not...

570
00:25:48.606 --> 00:25:50.686
But I think it's important to be aware.

571
00:25:50.686 --> 00:25:52.686
That's a very insightful question

572
00:25:52.686 --> 00:25:54.906
because most people don't talk about that,

573
00:25:54.906 --> 00:25:56.646
but I think it's really important

574
00:25:56.646 --> 00:26:00.706
that women would reconsider wearing the more fabric...

575
00:26:00.706 --> 00:26:03.486
<v Regina>Heavy metal, right over the heart center.</v>

576
00:26:03.486 --> 00:26:05.906
<v ->Yeah, I pay attention to it.</v>

577
00:26:05.906 --> 00:26:08.566
I think it would make sense that people pay attention

578
00:26:08.566 --> 00:26:12.666
to what it is they're wearing, and eating, and doing.

579
00:26:13.496 --> 00:26:16.121
<v Regina>So this work is really two part,</v>

580
00:26:16.121 --> 00:26:18.701
because first of all, you want people to be able

581
00:26:18.701 --> 00:26:20.561
to understand what the lattice is,

582
00:26:20.561 --> 00:26:24.461
identify it, and then begin using it in their own being,

583
00:26:24.461 --> 00:26:25.621
right?

584
00:26:25.621 --> 00:26:27.701
So they begin hooking up and balancing

585
00:26:27.701 --> 00:26:29.001
their own energy fields,

586
00:26:29.001 --> 00:26:32.681
allowing their own potentials to begin emerging

587
00:26:32.681 --> 00:26:34.721
through this awareness of our interconnectedness

588
00:26:34.721 --> 00:26:36.441
with the cosmic forces and beyond.

589
00:26:36.441 --> 00:26:39.361
But, the technique itself of the EMF,

590
00:26:39.361 --> 00:26:42.161
or the electromagnetic frequency balancing,

591
00:26:42.161 --> 00:26:44.321
is really the actual work.

592
00:26:44.321 --> 00:26:46.681
That's what you are out teaching and doing,

593
00:26:46.681 --> 00:26:47.801
from what I understand.

594
00:26:47.801 --> 00:26:49.241
Can you give us some anecdotes,

595
00:26:49.241 --> 00:26:53.041
what happens, what transpires during a balancing?

596
00:26:53.041 --> 00:26:54.601
Just some of your favorite cases

597
00:26:54.601 --> 00:26:57.051
so we get a visceral idea.

598
00:26:57.721 --> 00:26:59.181
<v ->First, if I could just back up,</v>

599
00:26:59.181 --> 00:27:01.461
EMF is for electromagnetic field.

600
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:05.841
20 some years ago, when I took my first ad out

601
00:27:05.841 --> 00:27:08.561
in one of these magazines that was just starting,

602
00:27:08.561 --> 00:27:10.701
people weren't talking about the electromagnetic field,

603
00:27:10.701 --> 00:27:12.561
nor were they talking about balance.

604
00:27:12.561 --> 00:27:13.921
Everything was healing.

605
00:27:13.921 --> 00:27:17.122
And I had to put in there what I was most comfortable with,

606
00:27:17.122 --> 00:27:18.926
so balance, I'm so happy to see

607
00:27:18.926 --> 00:27:20.686
that we all talk about balancing.

608
00:27:20.686 --> 00:27:23.186
We can always balance to our next level.

609
00:27:23.186 --> 00:27:25.386
What does healing mean to us?

610
00:27:25.386 --> 00:27:27.227
As a Saggitarian, healing would mean

611
00:27:27.227 --> 00:27:28.426
everything's all fixed, I'm perfect,

612
00:27:28.426 --> 00:27:31.866
everything is just right where it should be.

613
00:27:31.866 --> 00:27:35.006
But balance is really important that we pay attention to.

614
00:27:35.006 --> 00:27:36.826
How do we balance our energy?

615
00:27:36.826 --> 00:27:39.766
What is the energetic posture we're holding ourselves in

616
00:27:39.766 --> 00:27:44.446
as we go through our life, our daily life?

617
00:27:44.446 --> 00:27:46.926
Everything, daily life is the place where we're

618
00:27:46.926 --> 00:27:48.426
practicing and becoming,

619
00:27:48.426 --> 00:27:51.666
and I do like that word, practice.

620
00:27:52.006 --> 00:27:54.202
I'll come back to that in a few minutes,

621
00:27:54.202 --> 00:27:57.222
but to come back to the actual lattice,

622
00:27:57.222 --> 00:27:58.682
and some of the things that happen.

623
00:27:58.682 --> 00:28:00.882
So people learn about the lattice,

624
00:28:00.882 --> 00:28:02.682
and some people stop there.

625
00:28:02.682 --> 00:28:05.822
Other people come along, and what they do is

626
00:28:05.822 --> 00:28:10.532
they also work with (chuckles)

627
00:28:10.542 --> 00:28:12.302
There is an energy that they work with

628
00:28:12.302 --> 00:28:14.822
and what is interesting is this is a pattern.

629
00:28:14.822 --> 00:28:19.822
If you're looking down on top of the human being's head,

630
00:28:20.262 --> 00:28:22.962
this is the pattern that you would see

631
00:28:22.962 --> 00:28:25.502
that is the lattice.

632
00:28:25.502 --> 00:28:26.763
<v Regina>It's absolutely beautiful.</v>

633
00:28:26.763 --> 00:28:30.062
Just drawn to it naturally.
<v ->It's a female balancing.</v>

634
00:28:30.062 --> 00:28:32.163
And something that's interesting as an aside,

635
00:28:32.163 --> 00:28:35.562
and we are in conversation, so we'll go here,

636
00:28:35.562 --> 00:28:38.822
is that scientists have recently done studies

637
00:28:38.822 --> 00:28:42.042
where they are mapping electrical patterns

638
00:28:42.042 --> 00:28:43.682
in a human being's heart.

639
00:28:43.682 --> 00:28:47.362
The electrical pattern that is the most balanced,

640
00:28:47.362 --> 00:28:50.922
I just saw, looks like this without the square

641
00:28:50.922 --> 00:28:51.962
in the middle of it.

642
00:28:51.962 --> 00:28:53.182
<v Regina>Isn't that amazing?</v>

643
00:28:53.182 --> 00:28:56.782
<v ->And to me, this is our logo of the work.</v>

644
00:28:56.782 --> 00:28:59.442
It is the symbol of the evolving human,

645
00:28:59.442 --> 00:29:01.362
and that's what we are, we are evolving.

646
00:29:01.362 --> 00:29:02.502
These are the times.

647
00:29:02.502 --> 00:29:04.582
So the lattice is first and foremost

648
00:29:04.582 --> 00:29:07.542
for us to learn how to work with our energies,

649
00:29:07.542 --> 00:29:10.382
and to birth ourselves through even further.

650
00:29:10.382 --> 00:29:12.083
We are universal humans.

651
00:29:12.083 --> 00:29:13.742
I believe we're moving into a time

652
00:29:13.742 --> 00:29:16.903
that we are evolutionaries emerging.

653
00:29:16.903 --> 00:29:18.642
Having said all of that,

654
00:29:18.642 --> 00:29:21.262
so to me, that's the focus of this,

655
00:29:21.262 --> 00:29:23.302
and the focus of the work itself

656
00:29:23.302 --> 00:29:24.762
when the sessions are done,

657
00:29:24.762 --> 00:29:27.202
is to honor the human being on the table.

658
00:29:27.202 --> 00:29:28.422
And it's done in great honor.

659
00:29:28.422 --> 00:29:30.382
It's done with great joy,

660
00:29:30.382 --> 00:29:31.463
and people are always amazed

661
00:29:31.463 --> 00:29:32.742
at the sacredness of it.

662
00:29:32.742 --> 00:29:34.482
We laugh a lot, but there's

663
00:29:34.482 --> 00:29:36.162
a tremendous amount of sacredness.

664
00:29:36.162 --> 00:29:40.742
The work itself gained popularity and attention

665
00:29:40.742 --> 00:29:42.142
by word of mouth.

666
00:29:42.142 --> 00:29:45.942
It's grown to be in 70 countries all over the world

667
00:29:45.942 --> 00:29:47.822
because of people telling other people about it.

668
00:29:47.822 --> 00:29:49.742
<v Regina>You're headed to Russia this afternoon</v>

669
00:29:49.742 --> 00:29:51.442
for three and a half weeks of teaching,

670
00:29:51.442 --> 00:29:53.102
and you teach everywhere,

671
00:29:53.102 --> 00:29:54.502
going for months at a time.

672
00:29:54.502 --> 00:29:56.302
This is not a small endeavor.

673
00:29:56.302 --> 00:29:57.622
<v ->Yes, it's been like this.</v>

674
00:29:57.622 --> 00:30:00.202
My husband and I have been traveling together.

675
00:30:00.202 --> 00:30:02.542
He is actually my partner in this work.

676
00:30:02.542 --> 00:30:06.082
We've been traveling internationally for 12 years now,

677
00:30:06.082 --> 00:30:09.822
and we have rarely been home two months in a row.

678
00:30:09.822 --> 00:30:11.542
I've just enjoyed that, just now,

679
00:30:11.542 --> 00:30:13.842
which is nice with the grandchildren and all.

680
00:30:13.842 --> 00:30:18.722
But the work itself, when an individual is honored deeply

681
00:30:18.722 --> 00:30:21.992
through their pattern, when we use this structure,

682
00:30:21.992 --> 00:30:24.052
when we do this work,

683
00:30:24.052 --> 00:30:27.892
it can hold an energetic field

684
00:30:27.892 --> 00:30:32.112
where people can have spontaneous healings.

685
00:30:32.112 --> 00:30:34.232
I've always been very careful about this,

686
00:30:34.232 --> 00:30:36.732
because there are those, the way this work started,

687
00:30:36.732 --> 00:30:38.152
I remember there was one woman.

688
00:30:38.152 --> 00:30:40.172
She had growths in her uterus shrink

689
00:30:40.172 --> 00:30:42.262
when I first started.

690
00:30:42.782 --> 00:30:44.692
There was somebody else who had a physical healing

691
00:30:44.692 --> 00:30:47.192
of something with her face,

692
00:30:47.192 --> 00:30:51.232
and these two people wanted to bring a busload of people

693
00:30:51.232 --> 00:30:53.512
to my home for healings.

694
00:30:53.512 --> 00:30:55.492
And what I know is that

695
00:30:55.492 --> 00:30:58.313
what a person perceives as healing,

696
00:30:58.313 --> 00:30:59.912
and what is actually healing,

697
00:30:59.912 --> 00:31:01.372
are two different things.

698
00:31:01.372 --> 00:31:06.252
And some people heal, and some people don't heal,

699
00:31:06.252 --> 00:31:09.152
but they have balance to their next level of wholeness

700
00:31:09.152 --> 00:31:11.632
which may open the door for their relationship,

701
00:31:11.632 --> 00:31:12.812
because when you're in disease,

702
00:31:12.812 --> 00:31:14.372
you're in relationship with that disease,

703
00:31:14.372 --> 00:31:15.952
and so learning what that means

704
00:31:15.952 --> 00:31:18.292
and what lessons that holds for you,

705
00:31:18.292 --> 00:31:19.752
to me it's all about balance,

706
00:31:19.752 --> 00:31:23.572
it's about posturing, taking that breath, integrating,

707
00:31:23.572 --> 00:31:24.612
and in that moment is when,

708
00:31:24.612 --> 00:31:27.612
I'm going to say this word, I'm stopping myself,

709
00:31:27.612 --> 00:31:28.713
but I'm going to say it anyway,

710
00:31:28.713 --> 00:31:32.732
magic, or the spontaneous, let's go more professional,

711
00:31:32.732 --> 00:31:35.272
the spontaneous healing can happen.

712
00:31:35.272 --> 00:31:37.372
So spontaneous healings happen.

713
00:31:37.372 --> 00:31:39.812
Not just for me, but for the practitioners

714
00:31:39.812 --> 00:31:40.792
all over the world.

715
00:31:40.792 --> 00:31:42.412
I have many, many stories.

716
00:31:42.412 --> 00:31:45.932
There was one in France, I was there,

717
00:31:45.932 --> 00:31:47.952
and I speak to people through a translator,

718
00:31:47.952 --> 00:31:49.592
and I turned around and I saw this man,

719
00:31:49.592 --> 00:31:52.752
and I stop and suddenly my eyes feared, filled up...

720
00:31:52.752 --> 00:31:55.512
(laughs) There's a fear that this would be seen

721
00:31:55.512 --> 00:31:57.392
as a panacea, we don't want that.

722
00:31:57.392 --> 00:31:59.512
But this is a true story.

723
00:31:59.512 --> 00:32:03.872
I looked at him, and I said, tell me about this man,

724
00:32:03.872 --> 00:32:05.732
why do I want to cry?

725
00:32:05.732 --> 00:32:08.972
And he started to cry and they were tears of joy.

726
00:32:08.972 --> 00:32:12.352
What had happened was he had been diagnosed with a disease

727
00:32:12.352 --> 00:32:13.652
that he was told would keep him in bed

728
00:32:13.652 --> 00:32:15.132
for the rest of his life.

729
00:32:15.132 --> 00:32:17.632
Well his wife learned the EMF balancing technique,

730
00:32:17.632 --> 00:32:20.192
just a little technique, little bit of work to do here.

731
00:32:20.192 --> 00:32:22.632
And she did the sessions with him,

732
00:32:22.632 --> 00:32:25.472
and he became so strong that he decided to study

733
00:32:25.472 --> 00:32:27.492
and become a practitioner himself.

734
00:32:27.492 --> 00:32:30.252
And the doctors were so amazed that he was out of bed

735
00:32:30.252 --> 00:32:32.672
and he was practicing and he was doing what they were doing

736
00:32:32.672 --> 00:32:34.352
that they asked for the book.

737
00:32:34.352 --> 00:32:35.532
They were just shocked.

738
00:32:35.532 --> 00:32:38.712
This man was not going to live his life confined to bed.

739
00:32:38.712 --> 00:32:40.932
He was living a full life, and he was growing,

740
00:32:40.932 --> 00:32:43.832
and becoming, and helping others.

741
00:32:43.832 --> 00:32:46.132
So the basic philosophy behind this,

742
00:32:46.132 --> 00:32:48.192
and by the way, we've called it technique,

743
00:32:48.192 --> 00:32:49.512
which is interesting because people say,

744
00:32:49.512 --> 00:32:51.852
oh it's a technique.

745
00:32:51.852 --> 00:32:53.852
Technique is a user friendly word,

746
00:32:53.852 --> 00:32:55.712
and it is what it is.

747
00:32:55.712 --> 00:32:58.552
When my airline pilot takes off this afternoon,

748
00:32:58.552 --> 00:33:01.552
he has a technique, I'm really happy he's got that

749
00:33:01.552 --> 00:33:03.252
to get us up in the air safe and sound

750
00:33:03.252 --> 00:33:04.552
and back down again.

751
00:33:04.552 --> 00:33:05.972
And it's the same thing here,

752
00:33:05.972 --> 00:33:07.973
and when I first started doing this work,

753
00:33:07.973 --> 00:33:10.552
it really was not popular to have a technique.

754
00:33:10.552 --> 00:33:12.592
It was not popular to have a form.

755
00:33:12.592 --> 00:33:15.553
It's just like in tai chi, or in the martial arts,

756
00:33:15.553 --> 00:33:18.212
we have form, and we follow that form,

757
00:33:18.212 --> 00:33:20.432
and that brings up a certain energy pattern.

758
00:33:20.432 --> 00:33:24.232
Well in this work, and again I'm not in competition,

759
00:33:24.232 --> 00:33:27.552
it's not that I think it's better than free form work,

760
00:33:27.552 --> 00:33:29.532
but this work is different,

761
00:33:29.532 --> 00:33:31.473
and it still flows from the heart,

762
00:33:31.473 --> 00:33:33.312
and so we have a pattern we follow.

763
00:33:33.312 --> 00:33:37.872
We even have an accredited program.

764
00:33:37.872 --> 00:33:39.552
And that accredited program,

765
00:33:39.552 --> 00:33:41.752
when I return to Russia this time,

766
00:33:41.752 --> 00:33:46.293
all of our practitioners are now legal in their country,

767
00:33:46.293 --> 00:33:48.552
because the branch of the Russian government,

768
00:33:48.552 --> 00:33:50.832
just like in Germany and a few other places,

769
00:33:50.832 --> 00:33:55.212
they have a holistic branch, and for modalities like this

770
00:33:55.212 --> 00:33:57.192
to be practiced legally so that people

771
00:33:57.192 --> 00:34:00.492
don't get into trouble, I had to present this modality,

772
00:34:00.492 --> 00:34:02.492
all of our material is presented,

773
00:34:02.492 --> 00:34:04.832
they then make a program for our people,

774
00:34:04.832 --> 00:34:08.272
and they can take it, and they now may practice legally.

775
00:34:08.272 --> 00:34:11.138
So from the passion, and to find out that it's,

776
00:34:11.138 --> 00:34:13.378
I'm very excited, I'll be meeting several doctors

777
00:34:13.378 --> 00:34:14.538
when I go there.

778
00:34:14.538 --> 00:34:16.558
This work is now being offered

779
00:34:16.558 --> 00:34:19.639
in the Integrated Psychology Institute in Moscow.

780
00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:22.998
It's offered in complimentary alternative therapy

781
00:34:22.998 --> 00:34:24.738
institutions all over the world.

782
00:34:24.738 --> 00:34:26.698
Not so much, yet, in the United States.

783
00:34:26.698 --> 00:34:28.038
I think that will come,

784
00:34:28.038 --> 00:34:30.178
but it's been out there,

785
00:34:30.178 --> 00:34:32.418
but we're learning how to take something

786
00:34:32.418 --> 00:34:34.198
that is sacred, you want it here,

787
00:34:34.198 --> 00:34:37.164
you want to change the system, we learned this,

788
00:34:37.164 --> 00:34:39.684
you can change the system from the inside out.

789
00:34:39.684 --> 00:34:41.744
The world isn't going to stop one day

790
00:34:41.744 --> 00:34:43.384
and be totally different from the next.

791
00:34:43.384 --> 00:34:45.644
And listen to what people are saying on TV.

792
00:34:45.644 --> 00:34:48.144
Listen to the commercials, listen to the politicians.

793
00:34:48.144 --> 00:34:49.964
Listen to what's going on out there.

794
00:34:49.964 --> 00:34:54.225
So for us, who are the weird and the wired,

795
00:34:54.225 --> 00:34:56.844
who have a different view of the way things are,

796
00:34:56.844 --> 00:34:59.224
we're still a relatively small culture,

797
00:34:59.224 --> 00:35:01.304
but we're a powerful culture.

798
00:35:01.304 --> 00:35:04.805
And so I've learned to wear a suit jacket,

799
00:35:04.805 --> 00:35:06.824
a little soft, but it's still a suit jacket.

800
00:35:06.824 --> 00:35:09.364
I've learned to present in a way

801
00:35:09.364 --> 00:35:12.965
so that it can fit into people's belief systems

802
00:35:12.965 --> 00:35:14.104
and they can take it...

803
00:35:14.104 --> 00:35:16.784
This work is meant to help you grow in your truth

804
00:35:16.784 --> 00:35:18.484
and grow in your wholeness.

805
00:35:18.484 --> 00:35:20.544
What that is to you, that's to you.

806
00:35:20.544 --> 00:35:21.844
That's personal.

807
00:35:21.844 --> 00:35:24.904
So it's really evolved over all these years

808
00:35:24.904 --> 00:35:26.824
to a place where I see it building bridges

809
00:35:26.824 --> 00:35:29.024
with cultures all over the world.

810
00:35:29.024 --> 00:35:31.664
And seeing people healed or coming into greater wholeness.

811
00:35:31.664 --> 00:35:33.904
That to me is all side-effect.

812
00:35:33.904 --> 00:35:36.624
When one is ill, it's very important I understand that.

813
00:35:36.624 --> 00:35:39.804
But one embracing the illness, learning the lesson,

814
00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:42.124
calibrating it, because that's what we use,

815
00:35:42.124 --> 00:35:43.764
we use the word calibration,

816
00:35:43.764 --> 00:35:46.434
we then come into that wholeness.

817
00:35:46.684 --> 00:35:47.784
<v Regina>How many people around the world</v>

818
00:35:47.784 --> 00:35:50.924
are practicing this right now as practitioners?

819
00:35:50.924 --> 00:35:53.624
Just roughly, I'm sure you've lost track by now.

820
00:35:53.624 --> 00:35:55.364
<v ->Thousands and thousands at this point.</v>

821
00:35:55.364 --> 00:35:57.064
Thousands and thousands.

822
00:35:57.064 --> 00:36:00.364
And it's been an interesting path, I will mention.

823
00:36:00.364 --> 00:36:02.504
Someday maybe I'll write a book of what it's been like

824
00:36:02.504 --> 00:36:05.444
to be a large American woman teaching spirituality

825
00:36:05.444 --> 00:36:08.444
around the world, and also learning how to bring in

826
00:36:08.444 --> 00:36:09.884
a new form of business.

827
00:36:09.884 --> 00:36:12.344
We're an incorporated business,

828
00:36:12.344 --> 00:36:14.984
and we support all of our practitioners

829
00:36:14.984 --> 00:36:16.464
and our teachers in this world

830
00:36:16.464 --> 00:36:19.224
by a worldwide network.

831
00:36:19.224 --> 00:36:21.204
And we've learned how to present this

832
00:36:21.204 --> 00:36:23.144
to educational institutions.

833
00:36:23.144 --> 00:36:27.764
That has not been easy, but now it's getting easier

834
00:36:27.764 --> 00:36:30.104
because people are starting to understand more.

835
00:36:30.104 --> 00:36:31.704
Oh, that's how you do it,

836
00:36:31.704 --> 00:36:34.124
or this is what we're doing.

837
00:36:34.834 --> 00:36:37.004
Finally, it's a little more relaxing.

838
00:36:37.004 --> 00:36:38.804
<v Regina>Yes, and you're going to begin working</v>

839
00:36:38.804 --> 00:36:40.804
with corporations too to start bringing

840
00:36:40.804 --> 00:36:45.584
that kind of balance and awareness to corporate life.

841
00:36:45.584 --> 00:36:49.124
<v ->Yes, I've noticed, I've checked out</v>

842
00:36:49.124 --> 00:36:50.824
some of the business books out there,

843
00:36:50.824 --> 00:36:53.104
and businesses are much more open

844
00:36:53.104 --> 00:36:56.924
to quantum practices, or practices of wholeness,

845
00:36:56.924 --> 00:36:59.904
and we're presenting what we have as a quantum practice,

846
00:36:59.904 --> 00:37:03.084
as they understand the lattice, there's something else.

847
00:37:03.084 --> 00:37:06.764
And this is really exciting to put into this interview

848
00:37:06.764 --> 00:37:08.324
so that those who are listening will have another

849
00:37:08.324 --> 00:37:10.794
piece of the puzzle.

850
00:37:10.794 --> 00:37:14.149
The lattice is a system in our energy anatomy,

851
00:37:14.149 --> 00:37:17.489
and through this system in the energy anatomy,

852
00:37:17.489 --> 00:37:19.389
we speak the language of energy.

853
00:37:19.389 --> 00:37:21.729
However, when we are here, now,

854
00:37:21.729 --> 00:37:25.509
if we accept this theory of this lattice,

855
00:37:25.509 --> 00:37:28.249
I'm going to propose another theory to you.

856
00:37:28.249 --> 00:37:32.769
That is that together, we are making a third lattice.

857
00:37:32.769 --> 00:37:36.189
There's the energy of you, there's the energy of me,

858
00:37:36.189 --> 00:37:38.949
and yes, we are connected, we are all one,

859
00:37:38.949 --> 00:37:40.749
but there is this unique resonance,

860
00:37:40.749 --> 00:37:45.270
and there's a third lattice that we are working through

861
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:48.009
right now, the energy charges come together.

862
00:37:48.009 --> 00:37:52.849
I am in the same line of organizing, suggesting

863
00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:56.289
that as people start to understand the dynamics

864
00:37:56.289 --> 00:38:00.509
of the third lattice between you and point A and point B,

865
00:38:00.509 --> 00:38:04.809
person, place, thing, concept, you will have

866
00:38:04.809 --> 00:38:09.589
a conscious container so that you can understand

867
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:12.709
more of what you're doing with your most powerful,

868
00:38:12.709 --> 00:38:16.889
unlimited, infinite energy, and to be able to do it.

869
00:38:16.889 --> 00:38:20.209
And that, for me, it's like teaching people

870
00:38:20.209 --> 00:38:23.069
how to open the doors to accomplish what they want.

871
00:38:23.069 --> 00:38:24.709
And then having said that,

872
00:38:24.709 --> 00:38:27.109
knowing we're in metaphysics, indeed,

873
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:29.169
there are times to simply be.

874
00:38:29.169 --> 00:38:31.249
And I did that for a long time.

875
00:38:31.249 --> 00:38:33.909
I did a place where I was in being,

876
00:38:33.909 --> 00:38:35.849
and I was a non-person,

877
00:38:35.849 --> 00:38:37.669
and that is just as out of balance

878
00:38:37.669 --> 00:38:40.489
as overdoing and being egotistical.

879
00:38:40.489 --> 00:38:43.369
When I embraced that, let go, and let God,

880
00:38:43.369 --> 00:38:47.009
and release ego, I literally became nothing.

881
00:38:47.009 --> 00:38:49.049
And in becoming nothing,

882
00:38:49.049 --> 00:38:51.649
there was virtually no presence here on the planet,

883
00:38:51.649 --> 00:38:53.209
and that was not healthy.

884
00:38:53.209 --> 00:38:55.829
So I often, when I'm at these events,

885
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:58.289
I get these nice, beautiful introductions,

886
00:38:58.289 --> 00:39:00.089
and if I start to talk a little bit,

887
00:39:00.089 --> 00:39:02.469
I have to say, it's time for me to reintroduce myself,

888
00:39:02.469 --> 00:39:04.689
so perhaps I should reintroduce myself,

889
00:39:04.689 --> 00:39:09.269
and what I say is, I am an experienced fool,

890
00:39:09.269 --> 00:39:13.789
and that is how I've learned what I've learned. (laughs)

891
00:39:13.789 --> 00:39:16.249
You wanna talk about let go and let God, sure,

892
00:39:16.249 --> 00:39:20.169
I can show you how I did that and became a puddle of energy.

893
00:39:20.169 --> 00:39:21.989
And also, I love doing.

894
00:39:21.989 --> 00:39:24.649
So I've learned a balance of human being

895
00:39:24.649 --> 00:39:25.709
and human doing.

896
00:39:25.709 --> 00:39:28.249
But I'm so excited because this is the time

897
00:39:28.249 --> 00:39:31.529
the universal human, we are waking ourselves up.

898
00:39:31.529 --> 00:39:34.749
This is a tool that will support people in that waking up.

899
00:39:34.749 --> 00:39:37.849
It can also become a practice for them,

900
00:39:37.849 --> 00:39:39.589
and they can add it to the tools that they do.

901
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:42.809
It can become a part time way they make their income,

902
00:39:42.809 --> 00:39:45.809
it can grow into full time if they're really working at it.

903
00:39:45.809 --> 00:39:49.809
But I'm a very practical mystic.

904
00:39:49.809 --> 00:39:53.069
<v Regina>Yes, I can see that.</v>

905
00:39:53.069 --> 00:39:56.029
<v ->But not because I'm so wise,</v>

906
00:39:56.029 --> 00:39:58.589
it's because I've done so many things.

907
00:39:58.589 --> 00:39:59.789
<v Regina>Right, you've done them wrong,</v>

908
00:39:59.789 --> 00:40:01.669
you've done them right, you've learned,

909
00:40:01.669 --> 00:40:03.889
and you have learned, and Peggy,

910
00:40:03.889 --> 00:40:06.149
I know your husband's waiting in the wings,

911
00:40:06.149 --> 00:40:07.589
you have to get to the airport,

912
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:09.549
you're headed off again, to Russia,

913
00:40:09.549 --> 00:40:10.829
this is very exciting.

914
00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:13.509
I think there's a wonderful spirituality developing

915
00:40:13.509 --> 00:40:15.449
between those two nations as well.

916
00:40:15.449 --> 00:40:16.629
So on a large scale and small,

917
00:40:16.629 --> 00:40:17.809
I wish you the very best.

918
00:40:17.809 --> 00:40:20.869
Thank you so much for squeezing us into your schedule,

919
00:40:20.869 --> 00:40:24.089
and we'll let people know how to get a hold of you

920
00:40:24.089 --> 00:40:26.209
and find out where your classes and courses are

921
00:40:26.209 --> 00:40:27.129
and so forth.

922
00:40:27.129 --> 00:40:29.069
<v ->Can I thank you for being so beautiful,</v>

923
00:40:29.069 --> 00:40:31.009
inside and out?

924
00:40:31.009 --> 00:40:32.849
And thank you for the work you're doing.

925
00:40:32.849 --> 00:40:34.959
<v Regina>Thank you.</v>

926
00:40:36.969 --> 00:40:38.749
<v ->If you would like to become more involved</v>

927
00:40:38.749 --> 00:40:40.529
in Peggy's EMF balancing work,

928
00:40:40.529 --> 00:40:42.104
just go to her website to begin

929
00:40:42.104 --> 00:40:44.184
what will most certainly be a magical journey

930
00:40:44.184 --> 00:40:45.944
into healing and balance.

931
00:40:45.944 --> 00:40:48.864
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

932
00:40:48.864 --> 00:40:53.755
(entrancing spiritual music)
