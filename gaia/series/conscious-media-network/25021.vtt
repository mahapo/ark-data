(ambient music)

2
00:00:12.657 --> 00:00:14.492
<v ->Aajonas Vonderplanitz had to fight</v>

3
00:00:14.492 --> 00:00:16.620
for his life from a very early age.

4
00:00:16.732 --> 00:00:18.817
His story is challenging.

5
00:00:18.865 --> 00:00:21.255
After experiencing many injuries and illnesses

6
00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:22.833
the medical care he received

7
00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:24.156
took him deeper and deeper

8
00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:26.247
into a downward spiral until in his

9
00:00:26.247 --> 00:00:28.465
early 20's facing another bout with cancer

10
00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:30.913
he decided to fast himself to death.

11
00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:32.582
The hand of fate however,

12
00:00:32.582 --> 00:00:34.076
did not allow him to die.

13
00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:36.700
In the end it was raw animal fats and protiens

14
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.300
that saved his life.

15
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.284
And he says it's fat that saves

16
00:00:40.284 --> 00:00:42.326
many of our lives too.

17
00:00:42.822 --> 00:00:45.547
(ambient music)

18
00:00:52.593 --> 00:00:55.003
Aajonas, this is really intersting

19
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:55.985
sitting here with you.

20
00:00:55.985 --> 00:00:57.094
I've been trying to get together

21
00:00:57.094 --> 00:00:58.481
with you for about a year now.

22
00:00:58.481 --> 00:01:00.571
And if I were to look you up on the internet

23
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:02.939
knowing nothing about you I would find

24
00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:04.347
some of the most controversial

25
00:01:04.347 --> 00:01:06.353
information out there.

26
00:01:06.353 --> 00:01:08.123
You bring up a lot of fear in people,

27
00:01:08.123 --> 00:01:10.833
because of what we're going to get into in a bit.

28
00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:12.923
Which is interesting as I'm sitting

29
00:01:12.923 --> 00:01:14.800
here in your home and we're surrounded by

30
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.510
lotus blossoms and bougainvillea

31
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.752
and beautiful artwork, and it seems to me

32
00:01:20.752 --> 00:01:23.099
such a delicate being and beautiful heart

33
00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:25.440
is who you are.

34
00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.792
Yet at the same time, this perception

35
00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:31.797
of this primal element frightens people.

36
00:01:32.336 --> 00:01:35.253
So I want to get into who you are first.

37
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:36.901
Because you've had what most

38
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:38.501
people would consider to be

39
00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:41.275
certainly early in life an extremely painful

40
00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:43.530
journey to get to where you are now.

41
00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:44.283
Can you talk a little bit,

42
00:01:44.283 --> 00:01:45.883
just give your back story a bit

43
00:01:45.883 --> 00:01:47.717
if you don't mind, from childhood,

44
00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:48.912
just for a few minutes.

45
00:01:48.912 --> 00:01:49.936
<v ->Well, that's the only reason</v>

46
00:01:49.936 --> 00:01:51.728
I probably would be doing what I am

47
00:01:51.728 --> 00:01:53.072
and know what I know

48
00:01:53.072 --> 00:01:54.864
if I hadn't experienced what I experienced.

49
00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:58.640
Basically I was born into a very violent household

50
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.333
so I was abused terribly, physically.

51
00:02:06.013 --> 00:02:10.580
Not any sexual abuse, but violence.

52
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.002
<v Interviewer>Beatings and the like.</v>

53
00:02:13.222 --> 00:02:15.163
<v ->Yes, beatings and harassment</v>

54
00:02:15.163 --> 00:02:19.408
and putting the blame on me

55
00:02:19.408 --> 00:02:21.541
because I was autistic.

56
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.163
And I was the scapegoat

57
00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:25.546
for a lot of things, a lot of issues.

58
00:02:26.428 --> 00:02:28.155
And I had a brother who was still in diapers

59
00:02:28.155 --> 00:02:29.968
when I was born and he never forgave me

60
00:02:29.968 --> 00:02:32.586
for taking Mother's attention away.

61
00:02:32.741 --> 00:02:34.789
Soon as I arrived from the hospital at birth.

62
00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:38.245
So he would push me on rusty nails,

63
00:02:38.245 --> 00:02:41.125
rakes, anything, because my mom was

64
00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:43.344
a nurse so she should rush me to

65
00:02:43.344 --> 00:02:45.114
the doctor or the hospital and so

66
00:02:45.114 --> 00:02:48.826
I'd be getting a tetanus shot every few months

67
00:02:48.826 --> 00:02:51.813
instead of, think back then a tetanus shot

68
00:02:51.813 --> 00:02:53.584
was supposed to last a year, now they say

69
00:02:53.584 --> 00:02:54.842
it lasts five years.

70
00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:56.529
It all depends on how much money

71
00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:58.469
the pharmaceutical houses want to make.

72
00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.538
Is how long something will last.

73
00:03:00.538 --> 00:03:01.584
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

74
00:03:01.584 --> 00:03:02.714
<v ->So, it's got nothing to do with science.</v>

75
00:03:02.714 --> 00:03:04.847
So at that time it was a year,

76
00:03:04.847 --> 00:03:06.639
but I was getting them every six months.

77
00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.901
Three to six months because of my brother

78
00:03:08.901 --> 00:03:10.607
pushing me on rusty things.

79
00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:13.594
And my mother, in all of her career of nursing

80
00:03:13.594 --> 00:03:16.879
had only seen one case of lockjaw

81
00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.765
and whether it really results from tetanus

82
00:03:21.765 --> 00:03:23.776
or not that's all debatable.

83
00:03:23.776 --> 00:03:24.938
<v Interviewer>Sure</v>

84
00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:27.972
<v ->Another fallacy probably by the pharmaceutical industry.</v>

85
00:03:27.972 --> 00:03:31.734
So I turned autistic at 18 months old

86
00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:34.672
on my third tetanus shot.

87
00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:36.939
And the mercury and the alumminum

88
00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.415
and formaldehyde went into the center

89
00:03:39.415 --> 00:03:41.441
of my communication, the communication

90
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:42.827
center of my brain.

91
00:03:42.827 --> 00:03:44.705
And I could no longer function

92
00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:46.795
on a communicative basis.

93
00:03:46.795 --> 00:03:50.465
I understood people'e behavior.

94
00:03:50.465 --> 00:03:54.411
I was able to so call, "read minds."

95
00:03:54.411 --> 00:03:59.260
but it wasn't a language, it was a sensory thing

96
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.027
I knew when people were lying,

97
00:04:02.027 --> 00:04:03.456
when they weren't lying.

98
00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:04.992
I could read a person backwards and forwards

99
00:04:04.992 --> 00:04:06.955
like all autistic kids can.

100
00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:08.662
And one of the main reasons

101
00:04:08.662 --> 00:04:11.122
they shut down is because most 90%

102
00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:15.182
of what comes out of parents and adults mouths

103
00:04:15.182 --> 00:04:18.360
is a lie, and they sense that so they

104
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.795
completely cut it off, because as an autistic child

105
00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:25.160
it's impossible to deny truth.

106
00:04:25.976 --> 00:04:26.659
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

107
00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:30.520
<v ->So it makes us want to recoil,</v>

108
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.424
and distance ourselves from anything.

109
00:04:34.424 --> 00:04:37.517
But I wasn't allowed to appear autistic.

110
00:04:37.517 --> 00:04:39.949
Anytime I go up to my stare

111
00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.695
my parents would slap me,

112
00:04:42.872 --> 00:04:43.683
they would say,

113
00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:44.280
"Don't look like that,

114
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.731
"you look like an idiot.

115
00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:47.693
"You look like a crazy person."

116
00:04:47.693 --> 00:04:50.040
Back then, in the '40's and '50's

117
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.517
autism wasn't understood.

118
00:04:53.517 --> 00:04:55.650
So it was, "you're crazy,

119
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.232
"we don't want you to be crazy."

120
00:04:58.232 --> 00:04:59.597
<v Interviewer>Yeah, they don't want</v>

121
00:04:59.597 --> 00:05:00.984
you embarrassing them.

122
00:05:00.984 --> 00:05:03.928
<v ->So it was a violent way of altering behavior,</v>

123
00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:05.144
rather than understanding it,

124
00:05:05.144 --> 00:05:07.554
and biochemical the way that we see it now.

125
00:05:07.554 --> 00:05:10.242
Of course addressing it with pharmaceutical

126
00:05:10.242 --> 00:05:13.037
chemicals is no healing and no cure for it

127
00:05:13.037 --> 00:05:15.789
but there is a reason for it chemically

128
00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.927
and it can be adjusted dietary.

129
00:05:19.927 --> 00:05:21.762
<v Interviewer>But meanwhile, your whole body</v>

130
00:05:21.762 --> 00:05:24.209
started breaking down at a very early age.

131
00:05:24.258 --> 00:05:26.861
<v ->Well, because of all those early vaccines.</v>

132
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:28.930
<v Interviewer>Yes, tetanus shots,</v>

133
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.660
exposure to all the other things as well.

134
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.452
<v ->Well my mom's a nurse so anything</v>

135
00:05:33.452 --> 00:05:35.351
that went wrong it was a chemical

136
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:36.802
that she used.

137
00:05:36.802 --> 00:05:38.338
Even though she would always say,

138
00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.172
"I don't like to give you asprin

139
00:05:40.172 --> 00:05:41.239
"because it's not good,

140
00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:43.415
"it's not that good for you."

141
00:05:43.415 --> 00:05:45.015
She'd give us the stuff anyway,

142
00:05:45.015 --> 00:05:46.636
so it was like a war in herself,

143
00:05:46.636 --> 00:05:49.986
so she was always giving us penicillin galore.

144
00:05:49.986 --> 00:05:52.418
And I was coming down with an infection

145
00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:56.513
for the past three to five months.

146
00:05:56.513 --> 00:05:57.815
So by the time I hit 12 and a half or 12 years old

147
00:05:57.815 --> 00:06:01.335
in fact it was a week before my 12th birthday,

148
00:06:01.335 --> 00:06:04.577
I came down with a case of peritonitis,

149
00:06:04.577 --> 00:06:08.192
which was misdiagnosed as appendicitis.

150
00:06:09.262 --> 00:06:11.106
So in the end they found my appendix okay

151
00:06:11.106 --> 00:06:12.919
and took it out anyway.

152
00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:14.130
The reports said they were taking it out

153
00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.104
in case something causes problems.

154
00:06:16.104 --> 00:06:17.249
<v Interviewer>Preventative.</v>

155
00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:20.684
<v ->It was like if the medical and pharmaceutical industry</v>

156
00:06:20.684 --> 00:06:22.881
don't understand something then sure,

157
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:25.825
it doesn't have a purpose on this planet.

158
00:06:25.825 --> 00:06:26.636
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

159
00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:27.596
<v ->So rip it out.</v>

160
00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:28.385
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

161
00:06:28.385 --> 00:06:31.329
<v ->And they've just, I've known it for 20 some years</v>

162
00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:34.934
by my experimentation with autopsies

163
00:06:34.934 --> 00:06:39.051
and examining tissue and found the appendix

164
00:06:39.051 --> 00:06:42.699
contains all the bacteria all the chemicals

165
00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:45.110
that have ever entered the body

166
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.451
and what to do about them.

167
00:06:47.606 --> 00:06:51.318
So you body can react to 20, 40 minutes, instantly

168
00:06:51.318 --> 00:06:55.243
on defending itself against

169
00:06:55.243 --> 00:06:57.611
that particular containerization.

170
00:06:57.611 --> 00:07:01.216
When you don't have an appendix

171
00:07:01.216 --> 00:07:03.222
it takes 22 to 42 hours before your body

172
00:07:03.222 --> 00:07:04.459
is reacting properly.

173
00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:06.197
<v Interviewer>So it's kind of the first line of defense.</v>

174
00:07:06.197 --> 00:07:07.702
<v ->It's a library.</v>

175
00:07:07.702 --> 00:07:09.259
[Interviewer] Interesting.

176
00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:10.651
<v ->Of what would to do,</v>

177
00:07:10.651 --> 00:07:12.459
it's a library of what the body

178
00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:14.038
should do in the circumstance

179
00:07:14.038 --> 00:07:16.235
that this chemical reenters the body.

180
00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:18.184
<v Interviewer>Library appendix.</v>

181
00:07:18.184 --> 00:07:21.091
<v ->This year for the first time, the scientists,</v>

182
00:07:21.091 --> 00:07:23.438
the MD scientists, medical scientists,

183
00:07:23.438 --> 00:07:25.648
came out with that same conclusion.

184
00:07:25.648 --> 00:07:26.883
Just this year.

185
00:07:26.883 --> 00:07:28.139
<v Interviewer>Wow, interesting.</v>

186
00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:30.549
<v ->And I've been saying it for 20 some years.</v>

187
00:07:30.549 --> 00:07:32.235
<v Interviewer>Well, yeah and you've been</v>

188
00:07:32.235 --> 00:07:34.261
saying a lot of things for a lot of years

189
00:07:34.261 --> 00:07:36.352
that people still at this point are yet

190
00:07:36.352 --> 00:07:38.293
to catch up with.

191
00:07:38.293 --> 00:07:39.978
But you know, to kind of get to it

192
00:07:39.978 --> 00:07:43.200
you literally had so many life threatening

193
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.449
diseases by the time you hit 18 you had

194
00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:45.449
<v ->19.</v>

195
00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:46.842
<v Interviewer>19, you had blood cancer, you</v>

196
00:07:46.842 --> 00:07:50.501
had bone cancer, you had it all

197
00:07:50.501 --> 00:07:52.757
and you were really ready to check out.

198
00:07:52.757 --> 00:07:54.570
<v ->Well at 15 and a half I got my third polio vaccine.</v>

199
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.083
And it wasn't the Salk it was the injection.

200
00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:03.637
And it gave me angina pectoris,

201
00:08:03.637 --> 00:08:06.111
which were heart attacks, and it made me diabetic,

202
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:08.565
juvenile diabetic, so I was taking insulin.

203
00:08:08.565 --> 00:08:11.402
Juvenile diabetes is irreversible

204
00:08:11.402 --> 00:08:13.493
according to the medical professoin

205
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:16.159
so is psoriasis, angina pectoris,

206
00:08:16.159 --> 00:08:18.165
all those things that I developed,

207
00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:20.853
when I was 19 I had got an ulcer

208
00:08:20.853 --> 00:08:24.991
from becoming an alcoholic and a drug user

209
00:08:24.991 --> 00:08:27.807
because I was so fatigued as child

210
00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:31.839
by the time I was 8 years old I started smoking

211
00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:34.612
for the nicotine high, the nicotine energy.

212
00:08:34.612 --> 00:08:38.212
And I go at night into the kitchen and steal

213
00:08:38.212 --> 00:08:40.644
whatever coffee was left.

214
00:08:40.644 --> 00:08:42.279
Poured it in a jar, put it under my bed

215
00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:44.451
and drink it in the morning

216
00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:46.345
to be able to get out of the bed.

217
00:08:46.345 --> 00:08:48.201
And I was always in excruciating pain

218
00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:50.356
so I could never play sports,

219
00:08:50.356 --> 00:08:52.703
I could barely move without severe pain.

220
00:08:52.703 --> 00:08:56.009
So by the time I hit 19 years old,

221
00:08:56.009 --> 00:09:00.169
I was drinking alcohol to help me relax at night

222
00:09:00.169 --> 00:09:02.409
and taking benzedrines and smoking

223
00:09:02.409 --> 00:09:04.862
two packs of non filtered cigarettes daily

224
00:09:04.862 --> 00:09:08.084
to get me pumping the high.

225
00:09:08.084 --> 00:09:10.452
By the time I was 19,

226
00:09:10.452 --> 00:09:13.680
into my 19th year I'd started vommiting

227
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.017
blood because of the ulcer.

228
00:09:15.017 --> 00:09:17.017
The treatment for that gave me blood cancer,

229
00:09:19.295 --> 00:09:20.874
blood and bone cancer.

230
00:09:20.874 --> 00:09:23.455
Well first it gave me a stomach ulcer,

231
00:09:23.455 --> 00:09:24.799
because they went in and cut

232
00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:26.377
the vagus nerve to the stomach,

233
00:09:26.377 --> 00:09:29.001
put me in a state of oxygen area

234
00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:31.220
and it no longer retreats hydrocloric acid

235
00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.951
it will never digest proteins properly again.

236
00:09:33.951 --> 00:09:38.665
And then the treatment for that became cancerous.

237
00:09:38.665 --> 00:09:41.993
The treatment for that was radiation theraphy

238
00:09:41.993 --> 00:09:44.745
so that gave me blood and bone cancer.

239
00:09:44.745 --> 00:09:47.604
Cauterized my spine that if I tried to move

240
00:09:47.604 --> 00:09:50.584
just a few inches I was in excruciating pain

241
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:54.089
in my back and then the treatment for that

242
00:09:54.089 --> 00:09:55.945
was chemotheraphy,

243
00:09:55.945 --> 00:09:57.865
because it gave me the blood and bone cancer.

244
00:09:57.865 --> 00:09:59.998
Of course I was an invalid,

245
00:09:59.998 --> 00:10:01.940
I was a worm on the floor, because

246
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.724
I couldn't move without excruciating pain.

247
00:10:03.724 --> 00:10:06.604
I was defecating and urinating all over myself

248
00:10:06.604 --> 00:10:08.194
on the floor.

249
00:10:08.194 --> 00:10:09.228
<v Interviewer>And by 18, 19?</v>

250
00:10:09.228 --> 00:10:11.347
<v ->19, well 20 years old.</v>

251
00:10:11.347 --> 00:10:13.167
<v Interviewer>20 years old by this time.</v>

252
00:10:13.167 --> 00:10:14.907
<v ->And I was supposed to die at 21.</v>

253
00:10:14.907 --> 00:10:16.337
<v Interviewer>Alright, well here we are,</v>

254
00:10:16.337 --> 00:10:18.214
a number of years later, a few decades later,

255
00:10:18.214 --> 00:10:19.899
and you're alive and well.

256
00:10:19.899 --> 00:10:21.137
<v ->Yes.</v>

257
00:10:21.137 --> 00:10:22.395
<v interviewer>And now let's start</v>

258
00:10:22.395 --> 00:10:24.550
talking the journey of finding your own way.

259
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.748
Obviously the medical model wasn't

260
00:10:26.748 --> 00:10:30.162
working well for you, that's fair to say.

261
00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:32.551
And you were a very sensitive being

262
00:10:32.551 --> 00:10:34.641
and you reacted to all of these things.

263
00:10:34.641 --> 00:10:37.991
And yet somehow you mustered some

264
00:10:37.991 --> 00:10:41.297
not just curiosity but intuitive strength

265
00:10:41.297 --> 00:10:43.921
in yourself to begin another type of journey.

266
00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:45.884
Let's talk about the healing journey and

267
00:10:45.884 --> 00:10:48.039
we get into some pretty controversial stuff here.

268
00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:52.156
<v ->Well the healing journey began with me dying.</v>

269
00:10:53.476 --> 00:10:57.084
I was definitely going to die at a small house

270
00:10:57.084 --> 00:11:00.412
in Beverly Hills, a two-bedroom house

271
00:11:00.412 --> 00:11:01.644
it was all wooden flooring.

272
00:11:02.545 --> 00:11:03.996
And the reason I was in there, even though

273
00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:06.315
I was autistic still

274
00:11:06.855 --> 00:11:09.756
I would para-language, but I had like

275
00:11:09.756 --> 00:11:12.807
a lot of idiot savants, talent for math.

276
00:11:12.807 --> 00:11:16.028
So I could write a computer program

277
00:11:16.028 --> 00:11:18.097
in a few hours that could

278
00:11:18.097 --> 00:11:20.225
take them six months to a year to write.

279
00:11:20.913 --> 00:11:25.521
So the technical school that trained me,

280
00:11:25.521 --> 00:11:27.804
or used me I should say, they didn't

281
00:11:27.804 --> 00:11:28.849
have to train me, I was,

282
00:11:28.849 --> 00:11:32.619
Dustin Hoffman in the Rain Man.

283
00:11:32.988 --> 00:11:34.097
I could look at a problem and

284
00:11:34.097 --> 00:11:37.254
not have to write out the formula to get it.

285
00:11:37.254 --> 00:11:39.083
I had the answer.

286
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:40.305
So it was very easy for me.

287
00:11:40.305 --> 00:11:44.422
So I was a junior executive for carte blanche corporation,

288
00:11:44.422 --> 00:11:49.408
a time DC a trucking company, and sometimes IBM.

289
00:11:51.415 --> 00:11:52.631
I was farmed out.

290
00:11:52.631 --> 00:11:55.361
So I always had one of the professors with me

291
00:11:55.361 --> 00:11:58.305
to write out the curriculum, the flow chart

292
00:11:58.305 --> 00:12:00.496
besides the design.

293
00:12:00.801 --> 00:12:02.038
He would write out the lettering

294
00:12:02.038 --> 00:12:04.342
and stuff to my programs.

295
00:12:04.342 --> 00:12:07.308
And you know, I was making a lot of money

296
00:12:07.308 --> 00:12:08.780
as an idiot.

297
00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.017
So I was making a lot of money,

298
00:12:10.017 --> 00:12:11.809
so I had a small house in Beverly Hills.

299
00:12:11.809 --> 00:12:15.478
Two bedroom, and I was living in there

300
00:12:15.478 --> 00:12:17.142
with no furniture and no living room

301
00:12:17.142 --> 00:12:19.916
crawling around different areas on the floor.

302
00:12:19.916 --> 00:12:21.729
It was a long room.

303
00:12:21.729 --> 00:12:23.947
About 35 feet long.

304
00:12:23.947 --> 00:12:26.081
So I would defecate and urinate

305
00:12:26.081 --> 00:12:28.171
because I was in so much pain

306
00:12:28.171 --> 00:12:32.395
I couldn't get on a pan or a pot

307
00:12:32.395 --> 00:12:35.638
or urinate into a bottle or anything like that,

308
00:12:35.638 --> 00:12:37.046
but on a rare occasion.

309
00:12:37.046 --> 00:12:38.625
So I was defecating and urinating

310
00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:39.969
all over myself and then would

311
00:12:39.969 --> 00:12:42.827
pull myself, because I could only move my arms

312
00:12:42.827 --> 00:12:44.832
without excruciating pain.

313
00:12:44.832 --> 00:12:46.795
And crawl to some other area of the floor

314
00:12:46.795 --> 00:12:48.331
and just kept going around.

315
00:12:48.331 --> 00:12:50.592
And I refused to go to a hospice

316
00:12:50.592 --> 00:12:52.043
because I was autistic

317
00:12:52.043 --> 00:12:53.408
and people were dying there

318
00:12:53.408 --> 00:12:55.392
and I didn't want to be around that.

319
00:12:55.392 --> 00:12:58.038
So two volunteers offered to come

320
00:12:58.038 --> 00:12:59.680
in and take care of me,

321
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.515
two, three days a week.

322
00:13:01.515 --> 00:13:03.328
So they would come,

323
00:13:03.328 --> 00:13:05.248
they would shop for me,

324
00:13:05.248 --> 00:13:07.040
and what they would get for me

325
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.320
is what I requested,

326
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.301
was you know,

327
00:13:09.301 --> 00:13:10.624
doughnuts and RC cola

328
00:13:10.624 --> 00:13:13.376
and they would pour it into a blender

329
00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:14.400
and blend it.

330
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.107
Because after the radiation theraphy

331
00:13:16.107 --> 00:13:19.755
all of the bone around my teeth dissolved.

332
00:13:19.755 --> 00:13:23.211
So my teeth just dangled in my mouth

333
00:13:23.211 --> 00:13:25.173
so biting on my own teeth

334
00:13:25.173 --> 00:13:27.008
I would lose sometimes half a cup

335
00:13:27.008 --> 00:13:28.757
of blood in a couple of hours.

336
00:13:28.757 --> 00:13:32.059
So I was getting two transfusions a week just for that.

337
00:13:32.059 --> 00:13:33.296
<v Interviewer>And you're getting some really</v>

338
00:13:33.296 --> 00:13:35.621
high quality smoothies there, RC Cola.

339
00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:36.944
<v ->Yeah, RC Cola and doughnuts.</v>

340
00:13:36.944 --> 00:13:38.053
<v Interviewer>My goodness.</v>

341
00:13:38.053 --> 00:13:40.421
<v ->I would take, or they would take</v>

342
00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:43.024
rice krispies full of sugar already,

343
00:13:43.024 --> 00:13:46.565
and add four tablespoons of sugar to that and

344
00:13:46.565 --> 00:13:49.178
mixed with of course processed milk,

345
00:13:49.178 --> 00:13:51.375
so that was the kind of diet.

346
00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:56.218
And this a volunteer, a young 18 year old

347
00:13:56.218 --> 00:13:59.822
African-American boy, Steve Flannagan

348
00:14:00.582 --> 00:14:03.172
he offered me raw carrot juice

349
00:14:03.172 --> 00:14:04.858
and raw milk.

350
00:14:04.858 --> 00:14:06.180
He was this young boy,

351
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.865
I was young too, I was only 21.

352
00:14:09.205 --> 00:14:11.919
And he was 18.

353
00:14:11.919 --> 00:14:14.628
And he was making a lot of money.

354
00:14:14.628 --> 00:14:16.484
He was a singer, in the business.

355
00:14:16.484 --> 00:14:19.802
Just a compassionate individual.

356
00:14:20.875 --> 00:14:22.966
Finally I started drinking the carrot juice

357
00:14:22.966 --> 00:14:24.736
and the raw milk.

358
00:14:24.736 --> 00:14:28.491
And within 10 days of drinking that

359
00:14:28.491 --> 00:14:30.795
my autism shut off.

360
00:14:30.795 --> 00:14:32.096
<v Interviewer>God, that's amazing.</v>

361
00:14:32.096 --> 00:14:33.312
And I was able to understand language

362
00:14:33.312 --> 00:14:34.400
just like that.

363
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.723
Of course I didn't get well quickly.

364
00:14:35.723 --> 00:14:37.387
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

365
00:14:37.387 --> 00:14:38.625
<v ->It took two and a half years to regenerate</v>

366
00:14:38.625 --> 00:14:39.755
the bone around my teeth,

367
00:14:39.755 --> 00:14:41.376
before I could eat.

368
00:14:41.376 --> 00:14:43.339
I was not allowed to eat anything cooked.

369
00:14:43.339 --> 00:14:45.557
Because of the vagotomy I was told that

370
00:14:45.557 --> 00:14:49.312
if I ate anything raw whether it be banana or apple,

371
00:14:49.312 --> 00:14:52.490
I had to steam everything or I would die.

372
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:56.266
So I was told, cause I had said,

373
00:14:56.266 --> 00:14:59.786
I was in danger of bacterial paradisaical invasion

374
00:14:59.786 --> 00:15:03.029
microbe invasion, because I had no

375
00:15:03.029 --> 00:15:05.461
hydrochloric acid to dissolve and kill things

376
00:15:05.461 --> 00:15:07.873
that were bacterial and that's the whole

377
00:15:07.873 --> 00:15:11.029
medical myth and nonsense.

378
00:15:11.029 --> 00:15:12.694
<v Interviewer>Now with this, with the raw milk</v>

379
00:15:12.694 --> 00:15:14.677
and the raw carrot juice,
<v ->It's getting better</v>

380
00:15:14.677 --> 00:15:15.935
<v Interviewer>You're getting live enzymes</v>

381
00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:17.023
and you're getting better.

382
00:15:17.023 --> 00:15:18.243
<v ->Yeah, well there are no such thing</v>

383
00:15:18.243 --> 00:15:19.949
as the live enzymes.

384
00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:22.467
Enzymes are not live, they are protein structures.

385
00:15:22.467 --> 00:15:24.813
Bacteria is alive.

386
00:15:24.813 --> 00:15:28.141
And your body, our bodies are 99% bacterial.

387
00:15:28.141 --> 00:15:30.680
<v Interviewer>Yes, yes.</v>

388
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.197
<v ->So every time you take an antibiotic you're destroying</v>

389
00:15:33.197 --> 00:15:35.608
let's say you take a five day cycle,

390
00:15:35.608 --> 00:15:38.531
you're destroying 1% of the body's bacteria.

391
00:15:38.531 --> 00:15:42.562
Which reduces your activity, your functionality by 1%.

392
00:15:42.562 --> 00:15:46.658
Because people take it for 10 days, weeks, years at a time.

393
00:15:46.658 --> 00:15:49.986
The doctor that put my mother's implant

394
00:15:49.986 --> 00:15:52.505
in her ear for her hearing aid

395
00:15:52.505 --> 00:15:55.619
put her on antibiotics for almost a year,

396
00:15:55.619 --> 00:15:57.986
and all of a sudden, guess what?

397
00:15:57.986 --> 00:15:59.501
She couldn't digest, she couldn't function.

398
00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:01.144
She almost died.

399
00:16:01.144 --> 00:16:01.933
<v Interviewer>Yeah.</v>

400
00:16:01.933 --> 00:16:04.002
<v ->And I had to feed her papaya</v>

401
00:16:04.002 --> 00:16:05.538
to get her to start digesting again.

402
00:16:05.538 --> 00:16:09.037
I went to say goodbye, because I got a call

403
00:16:09.037 --> 00:16:10.637
she was going to die.

404
00:16:10.637 --> 00:16:12.151
Just like my son.

405
00:16:12.151 --> 00:16:13.731
They said he was going to die.

406
00:16:13.731 --> 00:16:15.373
And I brought him back with just food.

407
00:16:15.373 --> 00:16:17.570
<v Interviewer>So let's talk about getting</v>

408
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.492
into the more aggressive areas of healing yourself

409
00:16:20.492 --> 00:16:22.647
with food because this sent you on a journey.

410
00:16:22.647 --> 00:16:24.994
Once you started seeing the healing with them

411
00:16:24.994 --> 00:16:27.276
and because you had this native intellegence

412
00:16:27.276 --> 00:16:28.855
and ability to intuit.

413
00:16:28.855 --> 00:16:32.076
You really took on the study of health and nutrition.

414
00:16:32.076 --> 00:16:33.954
<v ->What you have to remember though,</v>

415
00:16:33.954 --> 00:16:38.071
because I didn't get my, had my communication

416
00:16:38.071 --> 00:16:42.081
faculty, I read my first book at 22 years old.

417
00:16:42.081 --> 00:16:43.105
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

418
00:16:43.105 --> 00:16:45.175
<v ->It was Siddhartha.</v>

419
00:16:45.175 --> 00:16:46.071
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

420
00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:49.634
<v ->It was like 82 pages, something like that.</v>

421
00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:50.743
<v Interviewer>Right, it's a little book.</v>

422
00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:52.407
<v ->It took me a full week, 16 hours a day to read it.</v>

423
00:16:52.407 --> 00:16:54.220
Because I had no vocabulary.

424
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.716
I had to look up the words,

425
00:16:56.716 --> 00:16:58.316
the definitions of the words, in the

426
00:16:58.316 --> 00:16:59.617
definitions of the definitions

427
00:16:59.617 --> 00:17:00.924
of the definitions

428
00:17:00.924 --> 00:17:02.012
<v Interviewer>Yeah.</v>

429
00:17:02.012 --> 00:17:04.039
<v ->So it took me a week to get through 82 pages.</v>

430
00:17:04.039 --> 00:17:06.279
<v Interviewer>So you weren't going through</v>

431
00:17:06.279 --> 00:17:08.520
volumes of text just yet, but your

432
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.399
own self discovery seems to be have been

433
00:17:11.399 --> 00:17:13.852
the most important part in all of this.

434
00:17:13.852 --> 00:17:15.665
<v ->But what I'm saying is when I learned</v>

435
00:17:15.665 --> 00:17:17.820
communications, then I all of sudden

436
00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:21.788
started mislearning everything else.

437
00:17:21.788 --> 00:17:24.177
So I learned bad things,

438
00:17:24.177 --> 00:17:26.097
so I learned vegetarianism,

439
00:17:26.097 --> 00:17:28.615
I learned radical approaches

440
00:17:28.615 --> 00:17:30.321
that were not helpful.

441
00:17:30.321 --> 00:17:32.710
And then when I got into those,

442
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:34.289
I started getting better and better.

443
00:17:34.289 --> 00:17:36.572
I started eating,

444
00:17:36.572 --> 00:17:38.406
started studying nutrition.

445
00:17:38.406 --> 00:17:40.817
Got a great nutritionist at the time.

446
00:17:41.917 --> 00:17:45.724
Who was advocating 70, 75% raw milk

447
00:17:45.724 --> 00:17:49.201
raw eggs, not raw meat,

448
00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:51.142
but those things,

449
00:17:51.142 --> 00:17:52.401
so I was getting better and better.

450
00:17:52.401 --> 00:17:54.214
So by the time I hit 27,

451
00:17:54.214 --> 00:17:57.179
I was a raw food vegetarian frutarian.

452
00:17:59.849 --> 00:18:02.229
<v Interviewer>You were a vegan for a while, weren't you?</v>

453
00:18:02.229 --> 00:18:03.807
<v ->Six and a half years all together.</v>

454
00:18:03.807 --> 00:18:05.322
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

455
00:18:05.322 --> 00:18:06.965
<v ->So that degenerated me.</v>

456
00:18:06.965 --> 00:18:10.207
I went to a good place, then when I went

457
00:18:10.207 --> 00:18:13.898
totally against any kind of lacto-ovo

458
00:18:13.898 --> 00:18:18.100
any of that in my diet, then

459
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.892
I started digressing.

460
00:18:19.892 --> 00:18:23.178
And that was the last two and half years

461
00:18:23.178 --> 00:18:25.631
of that journey.

462
00:18:25.631 --> 00:18:27.487
I got on a bicycle, I was going

463
00:18:27.487 --> 00:18:29.492
to go out and live on the land.

464
00:18:29.492 --> 00:18:31.988
And live with animals and Indian tribes

465
00:18:31.988 --> 00:18:33.588
and find that was true health,

466
00:18:33.588 --> 00:18:35.380
because I learned after being

467
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.407
in those books till I was 27.

468
00:18:37.407 --> 00:18:39.519
I realized there was nothing I was going

469
00:18:39.519 --> 00:18:42.147
to learn of truth from the medical profession,

470
00:18:42.147 --> 00:18:44.829
because they were run by the pharmaceutical industry.

471
00:18:44.856 --> 00:18:45.624
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

472
00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:47.757
And you're well versed in this.

473
00:18:47.757 --> 00:18:52.131
But you were also, in terms of

474
00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:54.413
your own experience, you would find

475
00:18:54.413 --> 00:18:57.080
that you would start, your health profile would rise,

476
00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.701
you would gain strength, your mind would

477
00:18:58.701 --> 00:19:00.728
become clear, and then when you do

478
00:19:00.728 --> 00:19:01.986
go on another radical diet,

479
00:19:01.986 --> 00:19:03.544
such as when you did become a vegan

480
00:19:03.544 --> 00:19:05.677
for example, it started declining again.

481
00:19:05.677 --> 00:19:09.368
<v ->My mind did, because I was so strong like you.</v>

482
00:19:09.368 --> 00:19:11.394
I stayed that way.

483
00:19:11.394 --> 00:19:14.552
Even though there were bad consequences to it.

484
00:19:14.552 --> 00:19:16.706
<v Interviewer>But what were some of the consequences?</v>

485
00:19:16.706 --> 00:19:18.647
And I ask this because a lot of people watching

486
00:19:18.647 --> 00:19:21.442
probably made that decision to switch over.

487
00:19:21.442 --> 00:19:23.127
And we'll get into the whole notion of

488
00:19:23.127 --> 00:19:26.285
different blood types, ethnicities, and

489
00:19:26.285 --> 00:19:28.930
is there a prescription a "one size fits all"?

490
00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.085
Do we all need something different?

491
00:19:31.085 --> 00:19:34.029
I went on a 20 year vegetarian, lacto-ovo

492
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:36.269
vegetarian journey, and I think I made it

493
00:19:36.269 --> 00:19:38.316
that long because of the lacto-ovo part,

494
00:19:38.316 --> 00:19:41.239
because I became ill and had to ultimately

495
00:19:41.239 --> 00:19:43.074
leave it behind.

496
00:19:43.074 --> 00:19:45.143
You went strict vegan for a while.

497
00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:46.700
What were some of the consequences

498
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.130
you were seeing for your body?

499
00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.732
<v ->Well because I had had anemia,</v>

500
00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:52.140
the blood cancer and the bone cancer.

501
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.420
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

502
00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:54.999
<v ->I didn't have to be on it but</v>

503
00:19:54.999 --> 00:19:56.866
two and a half years before

504
00:19:56.866 --> 00:19:58.701
I went down to 98 pounds.

505
00:19:58.701 --> 00:20:01.196
My bones started disintegrating,

506
00:20:01.196 --> 00:20:03.180
Leukemia again.

507
00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.167
And I was deteriorating.

508
00:20:06.167 --> 00:20:07.959
So I decided, I was living

509
00:20:07.959 --> 00:20:09.431
on a bicycle outdoors,

510
00:20:09.431 --> 00:20:10.924
which was very stressful,

511
00:20:10.924 --> 00:20:13.143
the temperature changes from day to day

512
00:20:13.143 --> 00:20:14.871
can be 80 degrees.

513
00:20:14.871 --> 00:20:19.010
Windstorm, sun storms, rain storms, blizzards,

514
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.591
was all through it, living on a bicycle

515
00:20:21.591 --> 00:20:23.489
in a sleeping bag outdoors.

516
00:20:23.489 --> 00:20:25.623
So it was very stressful,

517
00:20:25.623 --> 00:20:28.140
when you talk about the stress of a job

518
00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.145
or indoors,

519
00:20:30.145 --> 00:20:31.809
or emotional stress,

520
00:20:31.809 --> 00:20:33.708
you don't know what stress is

521
00:20:33.708 --> 00:20:35.393
until you live outdoors.

522
00:20:35.393 --> 00:20:36.460
That's stress.

523
00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.548
<v Interviewer>That is stress.</v>

524
00:20:37.548 --> 00:20:39.944
<v ->People used to fare that all the time without</v>

525
00:20:39.944 --> 00:20:41.480
central heat and air conditioning,

526
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.887
that was a normal part of life.

527
00:20:42.887 --> 00:20:44.445
100 years ago.

528
00:20:44.445 --> 00:20:45.575
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

529
00:20:45.575 --> 00:20:46.770
<v ->But now everybody's,</v>

530
00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.799
you got it easy as far as I'm concerned.

531
00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:52.402
But living in that as a fruitarian,

532
00:20:52.402 --> 00:20:54.066
strict fruitarian.

533
00:20:54.066 --> 00:20:56.839
No lacto, no ovo, no meats at all.

534
00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:58.994
I disintegrated heavily.

535
00:20:58.994 --> 00:21:00.957
So I choose to die.

536
00:21:00.957 --> 00:21:02.215
<v Interviewer>Because now the cancer's back,</v>

537
00:21:02.215 --> 00:21:04.050
and it's like, "I've tried everything."

538
00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:05.884
<v ->Right. I was aching every joint,</v>

539
00:21:05.884 --> 00:21:08.082
if the temperature dropped below 50 degrees.

540
00:21:08.082 --> 00:21:10.364
I mean 50 degrees I started having severe

541
00:21:10.364 --> 00:21:13.351
joint pain, by the time it hit 48

542
00:21:13.351 --> 00:21:15.548
I was tripled in excruciating pain.

543
00:21:15.548 --> 00:21:16.700
I couldn't move.

544
00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:17.660
<v Interviewer>So you were going to die,</v>

545
00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.154
you chose your way.

546
00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:20.434
<v ->I chose to fast to death.</v>

547
00:21:20.434 --> 00:21:22.076
<v Interviewer>To fast to death.</v>

548
00:21:22.076 --> 00:21:24.316
<v ->I picked an old Indian burial ground</v>

549
00:21:24.316 --> 00:21:28.817
in California. I bicycled, well,

550
00:21:28.817 --> 00:21:30.247
I couldn't bicycle much anymore,

551
00:21:30.247 --> 00:21:31.783
but I was in Alaska at the time,

552
00:21:31.783 --> 00:21:33.212
living with the Eskimos.

553
00:21:33.212 --> 00:21:36.169
And all the Indian tribes I'd lived with,

554
00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:38.417
four Indian tribes, and all of them suggested

555
00:21:38.417 --> 00:21:39.932
I eat raw meat.

556
00:21:39.932 --> 00:21:40.700
And I said, "Oh they're just trying

557
00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:41.873
"to kill the white boy."

558
00:21:41.873 --> 00:21:46.161
Revenge, you know, again I had been

559
00:21:46.161 --> 00:21:49.084
brainwashed into believing that

560
00:21:49.084 --> 00:21:50.534
even though raw foods were good,

561
00:21:50.534 --> 00:21:53.030
with the vagotomy, which is the severing

562
00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:55.590
of the vagus nerve, no hydrochloric acid in the stomach

563
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.284
I would die, I would get a parasite and die

564
00:21:58.546 --> 00:22:00.104
<v Interviewer>So this was heavily entrenched</v>

565
00:22:00.104 --> 00:22:01.576
in your mind that if you ate raw meat,

566
00:22:01.576 --> 00:22:03.410
you were going to die, of poisoning.

567
00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:04.520
<v ->Correct, exactly.</v>

568
00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.781
<v Interviewer>But you tell us this next part of the story.</v>

569
00:22:06.781 --> 00:22:09.426
<v ->Well, I was in this old Indian burial ground</v>

570
00:22:09.426 --> 00:22:13.181
outside, the foothills of a mountain range,

571
00:22:13.181 --> 00:22:15.890
San Martianas mountain range,

572
00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:17.767
in Thermal, California.

573
00:22:17.767 --> 00:22:21.565
And I was just drinking water

574
00:22:21.565 --> 00:22:23.741
to keep the headaches away

575
00:22:23.741 --> 00:22:26.151
and I was going to fast myself to death.

576
00:22:26.151 --> 00:22:27.111
I knew it would take,

577
00:22:27.111 --> 00:22:29.223
about 40, 60 days to do.

578
00:22:29.223 --> 00:22:32.487
So right away, I happen

579
00:22:32.487 --> 00:22:37.290
to pick a vein of the mountain

580
00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:40.312
where it lead up into a canyon

581
00:22:40.312 --> 00:22:41.784
where a bunch of coyotes lived.

582
00:22:41.784 --> 00:22:43.085
Their den was up there.

583
00:22:43.085 --> 00:22:44.451
So they would come down every night,

584
00:22:44.451 --> 00:22:46.947
wake me up almost like clockwork at midnight.

585
00:22:46.947 --> 00:22:49.443
And do their howling,

586
00:22:49.443 --> 00:22:51.698
and play games with me.

587
00:22:52.493 --> 00:22:54.499
By about the 10, 12th day,

588
00:22:54.499 --> 00:22:56.333
my mind is a little fuzzy

589
00:22:56.333 --> 00:22:59.128
from all the fasting from that period.

590
00:22:59.128 --> 00:23:02.221
But I was able to sense them

591
00:23:02.221 --> 00:23:04.888
going around where my campsite was

592
00:23:04.888 --> 00:23:09.496
down the wash so the day that I sensed

593
00:23:09.496 --> 00:23:12.866
all 11 of them, the next night

594
00:23:12.866 --> 00:23:15.676
they killed a jackrabbit and offered it to me.

595
00:23:15.725 --> 00:23:17.596
Ripped it up and put it at my feet.

596
00:23:19.801 --> 00:23:24.213
And I was also a philosophical vegetarian

597
00:23:24.535 --> 00:23:25.544
because I loved animals.

598
00:23:25.544 --> 00:23:26.909
So I didn't want to kill animals,

599
00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:28.616
as well as being afraid of raw meat.

600
00:23:28.616 --> 00:23:29.853
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

601
00:23:29.853 --> 00:23:32.754
<v ->So, what went through my head</v>

602
00:23:32.754 --> 00:23:34.312
at that moment though, you know,

603
00:23:34.312 --> 00:23:36.018
the coyotes were offering it to me.

604
00:23:36.018 --> 00:23:38.749
And I'm looking at the Easter bunny,

605
00:23:38.749 --> 00:23:40.306
they ripped it open for me, it was

606
00:23:40.306 --> 00:23:43.336
all warm and squishy and everything at my feet.

607
00:23:43.336 --> 00:23:47.474
So, I, this dialogue went through my head

608
00:23:47.474 --> 00:23:51.719
when I was probably about ten years old,

609
00:23:51.719 --> 00:23:55.302
my brothers and cousins were going rabbit hunting.

610
00:23:55.462 --> 00:23:58.354
And my uncle was telling them that

611
00:23:58.354 --> 00:24:01.511
if they shot a wild rabbit they needed to

612
00:24:01.511 --> 00:24:03.943
cook it until it was brown inside.

613
00:24:03.943 --> 00:24:05.906
That there should be no pink meat at all.

614
00:24:05.906 --> 00:24:08.381
Because there's a microbe in wild rabbits

615
00:24:08.381 --> 00:24:10.812
that will take over your intestinal tract

616
00:24:10.812 --> 00:24:12.924
within 48 hours and you'll die

617
00:24:12.924 --> 00:24:16.743
a miserable and painful death within 48 hours.

618
00:24:17.693 --> 00:24:21.479
So, well, the pain would come within 24 hours, dead in 48.

619
00:24:21.479 --> 00:24:24.572
So I thought, "Oh, the coyotes are trying

620
00:24:24.572 --> 00:24:26.463
"to help me die quickly."

621
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:28.090
So I picked up the rabbit

622
00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:29.093
and I started eating it.

623
00:24:29.093 --> 00:24:30.245
Of course it came back up.

624
00:24:30.245 --> 00:24:31.973
I had to psych myself into it,

625
00:24:31.973 --> 00:24:33.488
like at the dinner table, when

626
00:24:33.488 --> 00:24:35.045
I was forced to eat vegetables,

627
00:24:35.045 --> 00:24:36.944
it would make me projectile vomit.

628
00:24:36.944 --> 00:24:40.421
I'd forced myself into that mental attitude

629
00:24:40.421 --> 00:24:42.548
and ate the rabbit.

630
00:24:43.024 --> 00:24:44.282
And by the time I got through

631
00:24:44.282 --> 00:24:46.309
probably the 12th or 15th bite

632
00:24:46.309 --> 00:24:49.673
it tasted incredibly good to me.

633
00:24:49.893 --> 00:24:53.449
So I devoured almost three pounds, three and a half pounds.

634
00:24:53.519 --> 00:24:54.309
<v Interviewer>Wow.</v>

635
00:24:54.309 --> 00:24:55.866
<v ->Coyotes shared the rest, they went away.</v>

636
00:24:55.866 --> 00:24:58.046
I went back to my campsite to die.

637
00:24:58.158 --> 00:25:00.115
And I knew I was dying because I felt it.

638
00:25:00.483 --> 00:25:01.955
<v Interviewer>Right, like you were having</v>

639
00:25:01.955 --> 00:25:03.769
that lucid moment before death.

640
00:25:03.769 --> 00:25:07.353
<v ->Right. I had had three near death experiences</v>

641
00:25:07.353 --> 00:25:09.657
twice on an operating table where

642
00:25:09.657 --> 00:25:13.582
they had to revive me on a recreational drug experience.

643
00:25:13.582 --> 00:25:15.907
And I had to be revived.

644
00:25:15.907 --> 00:25:18.937
So I had left the body at those times.

645
00:25:18.937 --> 00:25:21.667
And when you leave the body like that,

646
00:25:21.667 --> 00:25:23.246
there's no pain.

647
00:25:23.246 --> 00:25:26.211
You leave the pain with the body.

648
00:25:26.211 --> 00:25:27.918
So I was having that kind

649
00:25:27.918 --> 00:25:30.222
of experience as I was walking in the body

650
00:25:30.222 --> 00:25:31.950
back to my campsite.

651
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:33.315
So I knew I was dying,

652
00:25:33.315 --> 00:25:34.899
and I woke the next morning

653
00:25:34.899 --> 00:25:37.139
and I'm still alive in my sleeping bag.

654
00:25:37.139 --> 00:25:39.187
I didn't go through any white tunnell

655
00:25:39.187 --> 00:25:41.363
or meet Buddha or Jesus or anybody.

656
00:25:41.363 --> 00:25:43.389
I was just still here in my body

657
00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:45.736
and I had pretty good energy

658
00:25:45.736 --> 00:25:49.171
for the next three days, four days,

659
00:25:49.171 --> 00:25:50.685
and I didn't die.

660
00:25:50.685 --> 00:25:52.477
And nothing bad happened.

661
00:25:52.477 --> 00:25:55.912
So I said, "Indians weren't lying to me at all,

662
00:25:55.912 --> 00:25:57.448
"they were telling me raw meat."

663
00:25:58.278 --> 00:26:02.483
So I started hunting, trapping chipmunks

664
00:26:02.483 --> 00:26:06.757
and birds and scorpions and tarantulas

665
00:26:06.757 --> 00:26:09.275
I'd eat anything I could get a hold of.

666
00:26:09.275 --> 00:26:11.536
I just break off the poison gland.

667
00:26:11.536 --> 00:26:13.392
<v Interviewer>Now this is the part that scares people,</v>

668
00:26:13.392 --> 00:26:16.629
because it's so primitive.

669
00:26:17.211 --> 00:26:19.237
<v ->Well if you go to Asia.</v>

670
00:26:19.237 --> 00:26:21.179
You can find these things,

671
00:26:21.179 --> 00:26:22.352
you can find bats,

672
00:26:22.352 --> 00:26:23.717
you can find tarantulas.

673
00:26:23.717 --> 00:26:24.656
<v Interviewer>I've been there, someone's</v>

674
00:26:24.656 --> 00:26:26.405
offered me an ant tart.

675
00:26:26.405 --> 00:26:27.536
<v ->Cockroaches this big, yeah.</v>

676
00:26:27.536 --> 00:26:29.093
<v Interviewer>I know, that's very true,</v>

677
00:26:29.093 --> 00:26:31.418
but it's this western perception.

678
00:26:31.418 --> 00:26:34.000
And let's just stop here for one little moment

679
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.301
before we go on, I want to get

680
00:26:35.301 --> 00:26:37.029
into the politics and the rest of it.

681
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:40.272
In that, if we go to the grocery store and

682
00:26:40.272 --> 00:26:42.938
we buy a steak and put it in teriyaki sauce,

683
00:26:42.938 --> 00:26:44.794
throw it on the grill, char the outside,

684
00:26:44.794 --> 00:26:46.821
leave it medium rare or rare on the inside,

685
00:26:46.821 --> 00:26:48.537
that's civilized, that's okay.

686
00:26:48.537 --> 00:26:51.354
But for you to trap these animals,

687
00:26:51.354 --> 00:26:53.188
and to eat them, this is primitive.

688
00:26:53.188 --> 00:26:54.020
<v ->Raw.</v>

689
00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.513
<v Interviewer>This is primitive, this is wrong.</v>

690
00:26:55.513 --> 00:26:56.686
This is frightening, even though rare meat

691
00:26:56.686 --> 00:26:58.884
just about raw it's barely even warmed.

692
00:26:58.884 --> 00:27:01.870
The psychological difference that frightens people

693
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:03.833
and so creates a lot of controversy

694
00:27:03.833 --> 00:27:06.734
around you is, what is it?

695
00:27:06.734 --> 00:27:10.083
That is happening there, as an intuitive being

696
00:27:10.083 --> 00:27:13.747
in our psyche, that we can not handle?

697
00:27:14.073 --> 00:27:15.502
<v ->Well it's our conditioning.</v>

698
00:27:15.502 --> 00:27:17.187
We're taught to be afraid of everything.

699
00:27:17.187 --> 00:27:19.470
And it's the most absurd thing in the world.

700
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:23.289
Look at, we've had raw dishes throughout history,

701
00:27:23.289 --> 00:27:25.251
Steak tartare.

702
00:27:25.251 --> 00:27:29.475
Is chopped raw beef and raw egg, mixed together.

703
00:27:31.045 --> 00:27:33.583
And the Germans eat more than anybody else

704
00:27:33.583 --> 00:27:36.121
of steak tartare, even the French.

705
00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:38.596
And we have carpaccio, which is

706
00:27:38.596 --> 00:27:41.284
thinly sliced, completely raw meat.

707
00:27:41.284 --> 00:27:42.500
<v Interviewer>But when it's called carpaccio</v>

708
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.145
and it's served on a tray in restaurant it's one thing.

709
00:27:45.145 --> 00:27:48.196
But you had to confront it directly, personally.

710
00:27:48.196 --> 00:27:50.905
<v ->Well the very first raw food that I ate</v>

711
00:27:50.905 --> 00:27:53.465
after eating the rabbit was a rattlesnake.

712
00:27:53.465 --> 00:27:56.281
And that was difficult,

713
00:27:56.281 --> 00:27:57.881
because there are a lot of bones in it.

714
00:27:57.881 --> 00:27:59.908
And it does not taste like chicken.

715
00:27:59.908 --> 00:28:02.361
It taste like raw fish.

716
00:28:02.361 --> 00:28:04.238
Snake tastes like raw fish.

717
00:28:04.238 --> 00:28:07.331
<v Interviewer>So this was, you were almost in a sense</v>

718
00:28:07.331 --> 00:28:09.486
by circumstance, you needed to eat

719
00:28:09.486 --> 00:28:11.427
whatever you found and was available to you

720
00:28:11.427 --> 00:28:12.878
because you were on the land.

721
00:28:12.878 --> 00:28:14.883
And so, over what period of time

722
00:28:14.883 --> 00:28:17.550
did you start really regaining some strength?

723
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:21.198
<v ->Well, after a week of trapping little things</v>

724
00:28:21.198 --> 00:28:24.187
and eating them, there's just not much food.

725
00:28:25.167 --> 00:28:27.869
And I was 96 pounds.

726
00:28:28.302 --> 00:28:30.840
So I got on my bicycle, went to all

727
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.720
the near local farms, and I was in farming country.

728
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:39.014
A lot of farm lands, mostly dates and citrus fruits,

729
00:28:39.587 --> 00:28:41.400
but there were lots of people with farms,

730
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.516
pigs, goats, cows, milking.

731
00:28:44.516 --> 00:28:47.374
So I made deals with different farmers

732
00:28:47.374 --> 00:28:49.201
to milk their cows or goats,

733
00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:52.508
shovel manure, any work on the farms,

734
00:28:52.508 --> 00:28:55.132
in exchange for all the food I wanted.

735
00:28:55.132 --> 00:28:58.161
So I was drinking a gallon of raw milk a day,

736
00:28:58.161 --> 00:29:00.977
eating anywhere from a stick to two sticks

737
00:29:00.977 --> 00:29:02.983
of butter a day, which is almost a quarter

738
00:29:02.983 --> 00:29:04.625
to a half a pound of butter a day.

739
00:29:04.625 --> 00:29:08.758
And chicken and eggs and everything I could eat,

740
00:29:09.916 --> 00:29:11.302
and within two and a half months

741
00:29:11.302 --> 00:29:13.067
I gained 50 pounds.

742
00:29:13.628 --> 00:29:16.124
And I looked like a scaled Arnold Schwarzenegger

743
00:29:16.124 --> 00:29:17.958
The first time in my life

744
00:29:17.958 --> 00:29:19.942
that I had muscles,

745
00:29:19.942 --> 00:29:21.841
before I was fat as a child and then

746
00:29:21.841 --> 00:29:25.504
I got very skinny once I became a diabetic.

747
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:28.155
<v Interviewer>And this was a combination</v>

748
00:29:28.155 --> 00:29:31.313
of eating all the raw fats, the raw proteins,

749
00:29:31.313 --> 00:29:34.235
but also you were doing some labor at the time,

750
00:29:34.235 --> 00:29:35.537
so you were using your body.

751
00:29:35.537 --> 00:29:36.710
<v ->Yes, correct.</v>

752
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:38.331
Which wasn't normal except for bicycling.

753
00:29:38.331 --> 00:29:40.145
<v Interviewer>So you had gone to die,</v>

754
00:29:40.145 --> 00:29:42.107
and now you're looking like, as you say,

755
00:29:42.107 --> 00:29:44.838
a scaled Arnold Schwarzenegger over a

756
00:29:44.838 --> 00:29:47.121
relatively short period of time.

757
00:29:47.121 --> 00:29:49.062
<v ->Yes.</v>

758
00:29:49.062 --> 00:29:53.386
<v Interviewer>What did you start focusing on after that?</v>

759
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.547
Because I know it wasn't too long after that,

760
00:29:55.547 --> 00:29:56.976
that you started giving nutritional advice.

761
00:29:56.976 --> 00:29:58.619
<v ->Right, a year later.</v>

762
00:29:58.619 --> 00:30:00.603
Yeah, I went back to Los Angeles,

763
00:30:00.603 --> 00:30:03.078
spread the word that raw meat was the answer.

764
00:30:03.078 --> 00:30:05.168
Everybody said, "You're going to get

765
00:30:05.168 --> 00:30:07.259
a brain fluke and you're going to be an idiot."

766
00:30:07.259 --> 00:30:08.944
And I said, "Been there, done that."

767
00:30:08.944 --> 00:30:10.843
<v Interviewer>There you go.</v>

768
00:30:10.843 --> 00:30:13.345
<v ->I said, "Been there done that many times,</v>

769
00:30:13.345 --> 00:30:15.024
"for most of my life, 22 years."

770
00:30:15.024 --> 00:30:17.110
But this was the only thing

771
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:20.497
that made me truly feel stable

772
00:30:20.497 --> 00:30:22.054
and well in my body.

773
00:30:22.054 --> 00:30:23.632
So I wasn't going to stop,

774
00:30:23.632 --> 00:30:25.104
But after three years of hearing,

775
00:30:25.104 --> 00:30:26.534
"Oh you're going to get a brain fluke."

776
00:30:26.534 --> 00:30:28.475
I started fearing it.

777
00:30:28.475 --> 00:30:29.947
I said, "Oh this next time,

778
00:30:29.947 --> 00:30:32.912
"is that going to be the time that I have a problem?

779
00:30:32.912 --> 00:30:35.046
"Is that raw meat going to take over?"

780
00:30:35.046 --> 00:30:38.459
And after 13 years of eating raw meat

781
00:30:38.459 --> 00:30:41.019
and 10 years of fear, I said,

782
00:30:41.019 --> 00:30:42.896
"There's something terribly wrong here,

783
00:30:42.896 --> 00:30:45.392
"I've got a vagotomy. I'm supposed to be

784
00:30:45.392 --> 00:30:48.464
"deathly ill from eating anything raw,

785
00:30:48.464 --> 00:30:50.896
"and here I'm eating raw meat for 13 years

786
00:30:50.896 --> 00:30:53.179
"and I've never gotten diarrhea or vomit

787
00:30:53.179 --> 00:30:56.485
"from it ever? This doesn't make sense."

788
00:30:56.485 --> 00:30:59.515
So I went to the main medical universities

789
00:30:59.515 --> 00:31:01.563
looking for the experiments

790
00:31:01.563 --> 00:31:04.122
to prove that raw meat gives parasites

791
00:31:04.122 --> 00:31:06.064
and there wasn't one.

792
00:31:06.064 --> 00:31:09.200
<v Interviewer>Yeah, we hear salmonella, bacterial</v>

793
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.248
poisoning, where everyone's afraid of raw eggs,

794
00:31:11.248 --> 00:31:13.914
raw milk, "Oh you're going to get sick and die."

795
00:31:13.914 --> 00:31:16.916
The stats are something quite different, most of the

796
00:31:16.916 --> 00:31:20.052
salmonella poisoning that takes place is from cooked food

797
00:31:20.052 --> 00:31:22.862
like, 95, 96%.

798
00:31:22.975 --> 00:31:25.803
<v ->99.99%</v>

799
00:31:25.803 --> 00:31:27.146
<v Interviewer>Is all from cooked food.</v>

800
00:31:27.146 --> 00:31:30.773
Okay, let's get into that, because I think we probably

801
00:31:30.773 --> 00:31:34.336
we need to talk about a lot of things here.

802
00:31:34.336 --> 00:31:36.554
Let's get over that myth number one.

803
00:31:36.554 --> 00:31:39.071
That if you eat it raw, you're going

804
00:31:39.071 --> 00:31:41.162
to become ill from bacterial contamination.

805
00:31:41.162 --> 00:31:43.274
Versus what actually happens

806
00:31:43.274 --> 00:31:44.831
when you cook the proteins.

807
00:31:44.831 --> 00:31:46.879
<v ->Well I've explained it in my</v>

808
00:31:46.879 --> 00:31:49.823
diet tribe on getting well and all of that

809
00:31:49.823 --> 00:31:53.365
how 13 years without any illness or sickness

810
00:31:53.365 --> 00:31:54.666
from that.

811
00:31:54.666 --> 00:31:56.735
I had detoxification of course

812
00:31:56.735 --> 00:31:58.164
with the chemo and radiation

813
00:31:58.164 --> 00:32:00.276
and everything else I had prior to that.

814
00:32:00.276 --> 00:32:01.492
And how do I know that?

815
00:32:01.492 --> 00:32:05.290
I had my feces, urine, tissue analyzed

816
00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:06.868
it had the chemotherapy in it,

817
00:32:06.868 --> 00:32:09.855
high amounts of the iodine and the radiation

818
00:32:09.855 --> 00:32:12.948
that was all given to me during radiation therapies.

819
00:32:14.538 --> 00:32:17.322
So, I had justification,

820
00:32:17.322 --> 00:32:19.585
I had laboratory tests to prove it.

821
00:32:20.125 --> 00:32:21.916
Never got sick from any of the bacteria,

822
00:32:21.916 --> 00:32:23.644
but you have to understand,

823
00:32:23.644 --> 00:32:25.756
that the medical profession wanted

824
00:32:25.756 --> 00:32:27.783
to make big money, so it was

825
00:32:27.783 --> 00:32:30.791
the Rockefellers, the Rothchilds, all of those,

826
00:32:30.791 --> 00:32:34.887
and even Carnegie, they had to

827
00:32:34.887 --> 00:32:38.108
adopt a program just like the military,

828
00:32:38.108 --> 00:32:41.757
if you got an enemy, you can instill fear

829
00:32:41.757 --> 00:32:44.146
into everyone and you hook them

830
00:32:44.146 --> 00:32:47.025
on paying for attacking.

831
00:32:47.025 --> 00:32:50.737
To go and fight people, human beings,

832
00:32:50.737 --> 00:32:54.470
killing them, believing they're against your religion,

833
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:58.054
or against your political system, whatever it is.

834
00:32:58.054 --> 00:33:01.297
Even though it may work for those particular people.

835
00:33:01.297 --> 00:33:03.110
And they do fine with it.

836
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.057
This was a way of starting a war

837
00:33:07.057 --> 00:33:08.657
within your body, to do what?

838
00:33:08.657 --> 00:33:10.385
To make you sick.

839
00:33:10.385 --> 00:33:11.921
So what is always attacked,

840
00:33:11.921 --> 00:33:13.734
the healthiest thing, raw milk.

841
00:33:13.734 --> 00:33:16.529
Can't get healthier than raw milk.

842
00:33:16.529 --> 00:33:18.598
<v Interviewer>I mean, the Hunza tribe,</v>

843
00:33:18.598 --> 00:33:20.305
don't they drink raw milk, the Hunza tribe

844
00:33:20.305 --> 00:33:22.246
and the Hunza peoples?

845
00:33:22.246 --> 00:33:23.462
<v ->They did, that was practically</v>

846
00:33:23.462 --> 00:33:26.278
probably 89% of their diet.

847
00:33:26.278 --> 00:33:27.814
<v Interviewer>They're known for their longevity</v>

848
00:33:27.814 --> 00:33:30.814
and their heartiness under in pretty extreme weather.

849
00:33:30.814 --> 00:33:32.478
<v ->Yes, in the mountains.</v>

850
00:33:32.478 --> 00:33:33.652
<v Interviewer>In the mountains.</v>

851
00:33:33.652 --> 00:33:35.252
So that's just one example

852
00:33:35.252 --> 00:33:36.809
of a culture that has historically

853
00:33:36.809 --> 00:33:38.046
lived on raw dairy.

854
00:33:38.046 --> 00:33:40.180
<v ->Well you got the Masai tribe, the Samburu,</v>

855
00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:41.652
Fulani, the Eskimo.

856
00:33:43.192 --> 00:33:45.705
100% disease free as long

857
00:33:45.705 --> 00:33:47.352
as they stayed on their raw meats

858
00:33:47.352 --> 00:33:49.223
and raw milk.

859
00:33:50.253 --> 00:33:52.237
<v Interviewer>So what happens chemically,</v>

860
00:33:52.237 --> 00:33:55.607
and what happens with our body's interaction with protein.

861
00:33:55.607 --> 00:33:57.101
Let's take dairy.

862
00:33:57.101 --> 00:33:59.981
When you pasteurize it, and homogenize it.

863
00:33:59.981 --> 00:34:01.197
What happens to it?

864
00:34:01.197 --> 00:34:04.397
<v ->Well, I can tell you theoretically what happens to it.</v>

865
00:34:06.447 --> 00:34:09.730
At 105 degrees the enzymes become cauterized.

866
00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.960
So they no longer will help you form tissue,

867
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.772
it doesn't even help you digest it.

868
00:34:19.037 --> 00:34:22.130
By 112 degrees you start destabalizing

869
00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:27.130
the vitamins, 122 you completely cauterize

870
00:34:27.165 --> 00:34:31.328
and neutralized, and destroyed all the enzymes.

871
00:34:32.835 --> 00:34:37.835
By 123 to 27 degrees, you completely

872
00:34:37.926 --> 00:34:40.506
incapacitated the vitamins.

873
00:34:40.832 --> 00:34:44.352
By 142 degrees, you completely

874
00:34:44.352 --> 00:34:48.298
altered them into a state where the body

875
00:34:48.298 --> 00:34:50.815
can't even reconstruct them.

876
00:34:50.815 --> 00:34:53.589
And then you start breaking down proteins,

877
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:55.082
things like calcium.

878
00:34:55.082 --> 00:34:57.514
If you look at the difference between

879
00:34:57.514 --> 00:35:01.418
the utilized calcium in raw milk to pasteurized milk

880
00:35:01.418 --> 00:35:06.063
then that's only 141 degrees for 15 to 30 seconds.

881
00:35:08.266 --> 00:35:12.084
Only 50% of that calcium can be utilized,

882
00:35:12.084 --> 00:35:14.239
the other 50% goes out in the feces.

883
00:35:14.239 --> 00:35:15.839
<v Interviewer>Now, when you have traditional</v>

884
00:35:15.839 --> 00:35:18.271
pasteurization, what does the temperature rise to?

885
00:35:18.271 --> 00:35:21.002
<v ->Now they're doing it to ultra pasteurization,</v>

886
00:35:21.002 --> 00:35:23.114
which is 270 degrees.

887
00:35:23.114 --> 00:35:25.759
<v Interviewer>So essentially, it has no nutritional value.</v>

888
00:35:25.759 --> 00:35:27.487
<v ->It's destroyed, right.</v>

889
00:35:27.487 --> 00:35:28.511
<v Interviewer>It's destroyed, right.</v>

890
00:35:28.511 --> 00:35:30.196
Now, when you have people, many many people

891
00:35:30.196 --> 00:35:32.607
in the culture with lactose intolerance,

892
00:35:32.607 --> 00:35:35.657
what happens when they drink raw milk

893
00:35:35.657 --> 00:35:37.812
versus pasteurized homogenized milk.

894
00:35:37.812 --> 00:35:39.263
<v ->Well when you drink pasteurized,</v>

895
00:35:39.263 --> 00:35:42.804
you got also a cauterized lactate, milk sugars,

896
00:35:42.804 --> 00:35:45.791
can't digest, so they get into the blood,

897
00:35:45.791 --> 00:35:49.588
start cutting, it's like a glass, start cutting cells.

898
00:35:49.588 --> 00:35:51.636
People with allergies to it,

899
00:35:51.636 --> 00:35:54.025
if they don't form enough mucus,

900
00:35:54.025 --> 00:35:56.073
or mucus that has good fibers.

901
00:35:56.073 --> 00:35:59.828
<v Interviewer>So that's what lactose intolerance is</v>

902
00:35:59.828 --> 00:36:02.388
often times you're saying, it's because

903
00:36:02.388 --> 00:36:03.753
the milk has been altered.

904
00:36:03.753 --> 00:36:05.993
But if they were to introduce say raw dairy

905
00:36:05.993 --> 00:36:08.297
into the diet, they may not have that experience?

906
00:36:08.297 --> 00:36:11.369
<v ->99% of people wouldn't suffer lactose intolerance.</v>

907
00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:14.163
Then you have 1% that does, but

908
00:36:14.163 --> 00:36:17.043
it's from the old lactose that's stored in their body

909
00:36:17.043 --> 00:36:19.113
from being cooked and processed.

910
00:36:19.113 --> 00:36:22.313
So when I give people like 2 to 4 ounces

911
00:36:22.313 --> 00:36:25.150
of raw milk a day over a three to eight month period

912
00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:28.707
that 1% is no longer lactose intolerant.

913
00:36:28.905 --> 00:36:30.057
<v Interviewer>What about the notion</v>

914
00:36:30.057 --> 00:36:33.854
that certain cultures, certain races, who are raised,

915
00:36:33.854 --> 00:36:36.072
say Asians for example, are known,

916
00:36:36.072 --> 00:36:38.824
to be particularly lactose intolerant,

917
00:36:38.824 --> 00:36:42.814
and can it be argued that because perhaps

918
00:36:42.814 --> 00:36:45.139
cows aren't as native to their land

919
00:36:45.139 --> 00:36:47.306
that they're using more rice and soy

920
00:36:47.313 --> 00:36:48.443
and other kinds of milk,

921
00:36:48.443 --> 00:36:53.158
that genetically they are beings that are simply not adapted

922
00:36:53.158 --> 00:36:54.993
to eating certain things, in other words,

923
00:36:54.993 --> 00:36:56.469
getting back to that "eat right for your type"

924
00:36:56.469 --> 00:36:57.578
<v ->No, it was another lie.</v>

925
00:36:57.578 --> 00:36:58.495
They didn't want.

926
00:36:58.495 --> 00:37:01.272
You know Asia includes India.

927
00:37:01.576 --> 00:37:03.112
<v Interviewer>Yes. cows.</v>

928
00:37:03.112 --> 00:37:03.880
<v ->India adores cows.</v>

929
00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.928
You're not allowed to kill a cow and eat meat

930
00:37:05.928 --> 00:37:07.485
but you eat their dairy.

931
00:37:07.485 --> 00:37:09.597
But they didn't want that

932
00:37:09.597 --> 00:37:11.667
because dairy is one of the most important

933
00:37:11.667 --> 00:37:14.541
defenses against pollution,

934
00:37:14.675 --> 00:37:16.445
because the concentration of minerals,

935
00:37:16.445 --> 00:37:19.688
because it can neutralize vaccine contamination,

936
00:37:19.688 --> 00:37:20.541
all that.

937
00:37:20.541 --> 00:37:22.184
So they want to get rid of the raw milk.

938
00:37:22.184 --> 00:37:24.104
They don't want milk in any form.

939
00:37:24.104 --> 00:37:25.725
Whether it's pasteurized or otherwise

940
00:37:25.725 --> 00:37:28.925
in other parts of Asia, so they lied about it.

941
00:37:28.925 --> 00:37:32.914
I've got many patients in Singapore,

942
00:37:34.204 --> 00:37:39.204
in Thailand, Philippines, a few in Vietnam

943
00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:42.222
that do excellently.

944
00:37:42.222 --> 00:37:45.145
In fact the main Chinese newspaper

945
00:37:45.145 --> 00:37:48.579
in Singapore did a whole front page spread

946
00:37:48.579 --> 00:37:51.182
on the people who were doing my diet.

947
00:37:51.182 --> 00:37:52.846
Because here they were these skinny weak

948
00:37:52.846 --> 00:37:57.427
Chinese people. That were now robust like Americans.

949
00:37:57.838 --> 00:37:58.670
<v Interviewer>Oh really?</v>

950
00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:00.078
And they did a feature on this, interesting.

951
00:38:00.078 --> 00:38:02.382
<v ->Yeah, and they did a whole full page article.</v>

952
00:38:02.382 --> 00:38:04.686
I wasn't able to read it, it was in Chinese.

953
00:38:04.686 --> 00:38:06.179
So it was translated.

954
00:38:06.179 --> 00:38:07.502
<v Interviewer>Hopefully they said some nice things.</v>

955
00:38:07.502 --> 00:38:10.168
<v ->I didn't have any input into it.</v>

956
00:38:10.168 --> 00:38:12.302
And they only gave it favorably

957
00:38:12.302 --> 00:38:15.630
because every Chinese person who was on it

958
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:17.486
in Singapore, did well.

959
00:38:17.486 --> 00:38:18.851
<v Interviewer>Interesting.</v>

960
00:38:18.851 --> 00:38:22.094
And this whole thing about fats and detoxifying,

961
00:38:22.094 --> 00:38:24.291
do you know who Udo Erasmus is?

962
00:38:24.291 --> 00:38:25.720
<v ->Yes.</v>

963
00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.598
<v Interviewer>Okay, so Udo is a friend of mine,</v>

964
00:38:27.598 --> 00:38:29.944
and he taught me about this maybe 10, 15 years ago.

965
00:38:29.944 --> 00:38:32.248
His own journey was, he poisoned himself

966
00:38:32.248 --> 00:38:34.253
as a hippie gardener putting a bunch

967
00:38:34.253 --> 00:38:36.515
of pesticides on butchart garden roses

968
00:38:36.515 --> 00:38:38.200
and walking through it barefoot,

969
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.736
and that's where he learned,

970
00:38:39.736 --> 00:38:42.467
he had read somewhere about fats

971
00:38:42.467 --> 00:38:44.941
will help pull the toxins out of the body, right?

972
00:38:44.941 --> 00:38:46.968
<v ->Well, what happens is</v>

973
00:38:46.968 --> 00:38:50.488
whenever, if you take it from the basic start

974
00:38:50.488 --> 00:38:53.816
of our understanding it was you analyze tissue,

975
00:38:53.816 --> 00:38:56.418
and we found that in the brain

976
00:38:56.418 --> 00:38:59.533
which is 60, 70, 80% fat,

977
00:38:59.533 --> 00:39:02.605
yeah you're a fat head, absolutely I am.

978
00:39:02.605 --> 00:39:04.226
It's a compliment.

979
00:39:04.226 --> 00:39:06.488
You know, in the bone marrow

980
00:39:06.488 --> 00:39:09.453
and in fat deposits, and people who were fat

981
00:39:09.453 --> 00:39:11.928
you had these concentrations of toxins.

982
00:39:11.928 --> 00:39:14.445
Pesticides whatever it was.

983
00:39:14.445 --> 00:39:16.941
So we learned from that,

984
00:39:16.941 --> 00:39:19.266
hey, putting fat into the body

985
00:39:19.836 --> 00:39:24.039
will absorb and detox poisons, toxins

986
00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:25.641
out of the body.

987
00:39:25.647 --> 00:39:26.500
And that's why when somebody

988
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.721
comes to me and has had chemotherapy

989
00:39:29.721 --> 00:39:32.139
or chelation theraphy

990
00:39:32.139 --> 00:39:33.869
and chelation thearphy is a poisoning.

991
00:39:33.869 --> 00:39:36.091
All of those are poisonings.

992
00:39:36.673 --> 00:39:40.592
Fat will help mitigate the damage done.

993
00:39:41.174 --> 00:39:43.286
And help remove it eventually

994
00:39:43.286 --> 00:39:45.499
and lower continual damage.

995
00:39:45.889 --> 00:39:47.617
<v Interviewer>Okay, and that's an important thing</v>

996
00:39:47.617 --> 00:39:49.046
for us to know.

997
00:39:49.046 --> 00:39:50.966
This is part of the, eating the whole fats

998
00:39:50.966 --> 00:39:52.374
and the raw fats in the diet,

999
00:39:52.374 --> 00:39:56.257
whether it be milk, cream, butter, raw cheeses

1000
00:39:56.257 --> 00:39:58.731
and so forth, this is partly,

1001
00:39:58.731 --> 00:40:00.673
<v ->And raw animal fats.</v>

1002
00:40:00.673 --> 00:40:02.550
<v Interviewer>And raw animal fats as well.</v>

1003
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:04.832
And okay.

1004
00:40:04.832 --> 00:40:08.694
<v ->And Udo got into a lot of oils.</v>

1005
00:40:08.694 --> 00:40:10.443
Pressed oils.

1006
00:40:10.443 --> 00:40:11.595
<v Interviewer>Fresh pressed oils.</v>

1007
00:40:11.595 --> 00:40:15.456
<v ->Yeah, they are very detoxifying, 90% detoxifying</v>

1008
00:40:15.456 --> 00:40:18.486
they don't stabilize and strengthen the body

1009
00:40:18.486 --> 00:40:20.107
while they detoxify.

1010
00:40:20.107 --> 00:40:22.731
However, animal fats do.

1011
00:40:22.731 --> 00:40:24.864
Butter is probably the most important

1012
00:40:24.864 --> 00:40:27.957
for the overall human, or any animal.

1013
00:40:27.957 --> 00:40:30.304
And then cream is necessary

1014
00:40:30.304 --> 00:40:32.160
but it's more difficult to digest.

1015
00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.123
And it helps the brain and the nervous system

1016
00:40:34.123 --> 00:40:36.747
where the butter can't as much.

1017
00:40:36.747 --> 00:40:39.371
But butter takes care of everything else.

1018
00:40:39.371 --> 00:40:41.333
So in my diet, I stress butter,

1019
00:40:41.333 --> 00:40:43.104
as the most important fat.

1020
00:40:43.104 --> 00:40:45.813
And fat that should be consumed primarily.

1021
00:40:45.813 --> 00:40:48.224
<v Interviewer>And this is not just you,</v>

1022
00:40:49.784 --> 00:40:53.450
the Western Price Foundation, Sally Fallon's work,

1023
00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:55.948
there are a lot of other, Pottenger's work.

1024
00:40:55.948 --> 00:40:59.063
This has been validated in the past as well

1025
00:40:59.063 --> 00:41:01.943
there are many validations for this,

1026
00:41:01.943 --> 00:41:03.735
many studies for this as well.

1027
00:41:03.735 --> 00:41:06.017
<v ->But all of them are plagued with</v>

1028
00:41:06.017 --> 00:41:08.641
the same belief, the fear of bacteria.

1029
00:41:08.641 --> 00:41:11.927
So Sally Fallon, all of those people,

1030
00:41:11.927 --> 00:41:13.804
say freeze your raw meats if you're

1031
00:41:13.804 --> 00:41:16.001
going to eat them, freeze your butter,

1032
00:41:16.001 --> 00:41:18.476
you know, stuff like that,

1033
00:41:18.476 --> 00:41:20.886
she doesn't say about milk thank god.

1034
00:41:20.886 --> 00:41:23.404
In my laboratory test with animals

1035
00:41:23.404 --> 00:41:25.302
I found when I fed them frozen meat,

1036
00:41:25.302 --> 00:41:28.729
and the same meat, one group frozen

1037
00:41:28.899 --> 00:41:33.296
and the same meat raw unfrozen, other group.

1038
00:41:33.296 --> 00:41:36.026
Every one of the animals in the frozen group

1039
00:41:36.026 --> 00:41:39.476
got a skin disorder all the way to the point of scabies.

1040
00:41:40.043 --> 00:41:40.981
<v Interviewer>Oh, interesting.</v>

1041
00:41:40.981 --> 00:41:42.240
<v ->It's terrible.</v>

1042
00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.181
Then I knew that butter, raw butter

1043
00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:46.080
would reverse those conditions

1044
00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.213
because of my experiments with humans

1045
00:41:48.213 --> 00:41:49.514
and feeding people butter

1046
00:41:49.514 --> 00:41:53.717
and how quickly it alleviated a lot of the skin problems.

1047
00:41:53.717 --> 00:41:58.035
Up to 80% even 100% in some circumstances,

1048
00:41:59.748 --> 00:42:01.220
but some people still have to

1049
00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:02.265
deal with acne and stuff like that,

1050
00:42:02.265 --> 00:42:04.526
rashes, but 80% of them reduced.

1051
00:42:04.526 --> 00:42:08.132
So when I fed half of that sick group

1052
00:42:08.132 --> 00:42:11.801
raw butter and the other frozen raw butter

1053
00:42:11.801 --> 00:42:14.126
which I cant call raw anymore.

1054
00:42:14.126 --> 00:42:16.722
The ones who had the frozen butter

1055
00:42:16.722 --> 00:42:18.416
took five times longer to heal.

1056
00:42:18.416 --> 00:42:21.290
Than those that had it unfrozen.

1057
00:42:21.723 --> 00:42:25.157
Now, Sally, even though she hasn't done experiments

1058
00:42:25.157 --> 00:42:29.680
denies that, and J Crew, the MD J Crew

1059
00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:33.413
or the scientist J Crew that studied raw milk

1060
00:42:33.413 --> 00:42:35.973
and used raw milk diets, he said the same thing.

1061
00:42:35.973 --> 00:42:38.533
That when you freeze the cream,

1062
00:42:38.533 --> 00:42:40.368
it doesn't work as well.

1063
00:42:41.678 --> 00:42:44.954
I don't know why people are denying this fact.

1064
00:42:46.197 --> 00:42:47.712
It is a fact.

1065
00:42:47.712 --> 00:42:48.949
<v Interviewer>Okay.</v>

1066
00:42:48.949 --> 00:42:51.957
I want to work something else in at this point.

1067
00:42:51.957 --> 00:42:54.432
<v ->I want to put something else in there about that.</v>

1068
00:42:54.432 --> 00:42:56.245
People are afraid of being overwhelemed.

1069
00:42:56.245 --> 00:42:57.845
<v Interviewer>I was just going to ask you that.</v>

1070
00:42:57.845 --> 00:43:02.560
<v ->110 years ago you couldn't get a man</v>

1071
00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:05.162
to marry a skinny woman because why?

1072
00:43:05.162 --> 00:43:06.741
There was no central heat

1073
00:43:06.741 --> 00:43:08.256
there was no central air conditioning

1074
00:43:08.256 --> 00:43:10.560
if you lived in an enviroment

1075
00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:12.266
where it was snowing and cold

1076
00:43:12.266 --> 00:43:14.378
if the woman were skinny

1077
00:43:14.378 --> 00:43:15.957
and she were pregnant,

1078
00:43:15.957 --> 00:43:17.535
she would most likely die.

1079
00:43:17.535 --> 00:43:18.815
And the baby with her.

1080
00:43:18.815 --> 00:43:20.565
And then who was left to raise children?

1081
00:43:20.565 --> 00:43:23.679
If there were any that were conceived

1082
00:43:23.679 --> 00:43:25.407
in that family prior to that.

1083
00:43:25.407 --> 00:43:28.031
So, skinny women were shunned upon,

1084
00:43:28.031 --> 00:43:31.423
they mostly became professional women,

1085
00:43:31.423 --> 00:43:34.474
or women who were prostitutes

1086
00:43:34.474 --> 00:43:36.671
or something like that who didn't

1087
00:43:36.671 --> 00:43:38.442
have to deal with family life.

1088
00:43:38.442 --> 00:43:42.986
But your family woman was a robust, fat woman.

1089
00:43:42.986 --> 00:43:45.482
<v Interviewer>And that is still true</v>

1090
00:43:45.482 --> 00:43:46.783
in many cultures around the world today.

1091
00:43:46.783 --> 00:43:47.615
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1092
00:43:47.615 --> 00:43:49.258
<v Interviewer>And yet, in the west</v>

1093
00:43:49.258 --> 00:43:51.946
we certainly have been brainwashed

1094
00:43:51.946 --> 00:43:54.527
into being phobic about ending up in that class

1095
00:43:54.527 --> 00:43:56.803
of having extra pounds on the body.

1096
00:43:57.087 --> 00:43:58.239
<v ->And when you've been on this diet</v>

1097
00:43:58.239 --> 00:43:59.540
as long as I have been,

1098
00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.905
I have been on this diet now

1099
00:44:00.905 --> 00:44:04.063
eating raw foods since 1972,

1100
00:44:04.063 --> 00:44:06.559
so I'm nearing 40 years.

1101
00:44:06.559 --> 00:44:08.351
However, I didn't start eating

1102
00:44:08.351 --> 00:44:11.423
raw meat on a daily basis until '82.

1103
00:44:11.423 --> 00:44:13.705
So I've been doing this for 32 years,

1104
00:44:13.705 --> 00:44:15.470
eating the raw meat.

1105
00:44:15.497 --> 00:44:16.884
<v Interviewer>And drinking lots of raw milk.</v>

1106
00:44:16.884 --> 00:44:18.548
<v ->And eating lots of raw butter.</v>

1107
00:44:18.548 --> 00:44:20.596
<v Interviewer>And you have no excess weight on you.</v>

1108
00:44:20.596 --> 00:44:23.966
<v ->I do, I have 18% body fat.</v>

1109
00:44:23.966 --> 00:44:25.987
But you don't see it.

1110
00:44:26.228 --> 00:44:27.444
You have to understand that

1111
00:44:27.444 --> 00:44:29.065
when you have a raw fat molecule

1112
00:44:29.065 --> 00:44:31.945
and it's integrated into our system

1113
00:44:31.945 --> 00:44:35.252
for the fat for our bodies is a very tiny molecule.

1114
00:44:35.252 --> 00:44:39.219
When you cook a fat, it swells anywhere from

1115
00:44:39.219 --> 00:44:43.267
2 to 100 or 50 times its normal size.

1116
00:44:44.702 --> 00:44:46.750
<v Interviewer>I would never guess you have 18% body fat</v>

1117
00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:49.246
you look totally perfect, really.

1118
00:44:49.246 --> 00:44:52.766
<v ->I look like an athlete with 8 to 10% body fat.</v>

1119
00:44:52.766 --> 00:44:54.174
<v Interviewer>Yeah, you do.</v>

1120
00:44:54.174 --> 00:44:55.753
And you eat a lot of fat.

1121
00:44:55.753 --> 00:44:57.417
That's a very interesting distinction.

1122
00:44:57.417 --> 00:44:59.081
Because I was going to ask you that next.

1123
00:44:59.081 --> 00:45:01.619
<v ->But when I was ill, I kept my fat weight</v>

1124
00:45:01.619 --> 00:45:04.840
at anywhere from 27 to 30%, a woman's weight.

1125
00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.398
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

1126
00:45:06.398 --> 00:45:08.680
And that should be more of a normal woman's weight.

1127
00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.579
<v ->That should be a normal weight for anybody</v>

1128
00:45:10.579 --> 00:45:13.310
who has been on a cooked food diet for life.

1129
00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:17.982
They should all be at least 20, 25 pounds overweight

1130
00:45:17.982 --> 00:45:21.658
for, 20 30 years depending on their health condition.

1131
00:45:21.792 --> 00:45:22.795
<v Interviewer>So have you seen people</v>

1132
00:45:22.795 --> 00:45:25.845
that take on this relatively high fat, but raw fats diet

1133
00:45:25.845 --> 00:45:27.872
actually lose weight?

1134
00:45:27.872 --> 00:45:29.536
<v ->Oh yes.</v>

1135
00:45:29.536 --> 00:45:32.821
Yes if they're extremely overweight definitely.

1136
00:45:32.821 --> 00:45:34.656
So let's say I had a person who was

1137
00:45:34.656 --> 00:45:37.664
300 pounds for most of his life.

1138
00:45:37.664 --> 00:45:41.711
He went down to 25, 20 pounds overweight.

1139
00:45:43.509 --> 00:45:46.261
But he was also a drug addict

1140
00:45:46.261 --> 00:45:48.735
and an alcoholic for 25 years.

1141
00:45:48.735 --> 00:45:53.429
And when I did tests for his intestines

1142
00:45:53.429 --> 00:45:57.589
and his glands and his heart and everything

1143
00:45:57.589 --> 00:46:02.069
they tested very high like was in his late 20's, early 30's.

1144
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:05.284
And he was in his mid 50's.

1145
00:46:05.973 --> 00:46:08.597
And he looked incredibly healthy, why?

1146
00:46:08.597 --> 00:46:10.602
Because he had all this fat,

1147
00:46:10.602 --> 00:46:12.223
even though it wasn't good fat,

1148
00:46:12.223 --> 00:46:14.079
poison still go into fat no matter

1149
00:46:14.079 --> 00:46:15.423
if they're good or bad.

1150
00:46:15.423 --> 00:46:18.047
So when he threw off that fat

1151
00:46:18.047 --> 00:46:19.924
he threw off most of those toxins

1152
00:46:19.924 --> 00:46:22.228
that never got to invade the cells

1153
00:46:22.228 --> 00:46:23.786
his glands and his organs.

1154
00:46:23.786 --> 00:46:25.471
<v Interviewer>Interesting.</v>

1155
00:46:26.991 --> 00:46:29.439
<v ->So I look at people who are fat,</v>

1156
00:46:29.439 --> 00:46:31.380
and say, "You are blessed."

1157
00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:33.635
and that's the first time they hear it.

1158
00:46:34.196 --> 00:46:35.348
And I say, "You have been blessed

1159
00:46:35.348 --> 00:46:37.481
"because you have been fat all of your life.

1160
00:46:37.481 --> 00:46:39.508
"You're protected. You have better health.

1161
00:46:39.508 --> 00:46:42.623
"Now do it differently. Put different fat on

1162
00:46:42.623 --> 00:46:45.375
"so you can start reducing the number

1163
00:46:45.375 --> 00:46:47.359
"of those big huge fat molecules of fat

1164
00:46:47.359 --> 00:46:49.151
"that make you huge."

1165
00:46:49.151 --> 00:46:50.879
<v Interviewer>Interesting.</v>

1166
00:46:50.879 --> 00:46:51.860
And that's probably the first time

1167
00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.036
anybody listening has ever ever heard that.

1168
00:46:54.036 --> 00:46:55.316
<v ->Probably ever heard that, yeah.</v>

1169
00:46:55.316 --> 00:46:57.790
<v Interviewer>Now, aside from that,</v>

1170
00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:00.158
you also it's not as though you

1171
00:47:00.158 --> 00:47:02.462
completely shunned the vegetable kingdom.

1172
00:47:02.462 --> 00:47:05.108
I mean, from what I read, and tell me,

1173
00:47:05.108 --> 00:47:06.750
I don't know if this is still true.

1174
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:11.273
You also, you do fresh juices, fresh vegetable juices,

1175
00:47:11.273 --> 00:47:13.705
but you accompany it with fat.

1176
00:47:13.705 --> 00:47:15.454
Now I'm bringing this up because

1177
00:47:15.454 --> 00:47:18.334
I have a juicing machine and I love the

1178
00:47:18.334 --> 00:47:21.022
notion of getting fresh vital green in my body

1179
00:47:21.022 --> 00:47:23.347
but then I start getting light headed

1180
00:47:23.347 --> 00:47:27.635
and I notice I have to eat something fat with it

1181
00:47:27.635 --> 00:47:29.001
or I just don't function

1182
00:47:29.001 --> 00:47:30.665
or I feel a little sick to my stomach.

1183
00:47:30.665 --> 00:47:32.627
What's going on there?

1184
00:47:32.627 --> 00:47:33.694
<v ->Well you've got two things.</v>

1185
00:47:33.694 --> 00:47:37.064
Your inundating yourself with enzymes for digestion.

1186
00:47:37.064 --> 00:47:40.499
A lot of people don't mix their juices right

1187
00:47:40.499 --> 00:47:42.760
so they get a lot of carbohydrate

1188
00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:45.256
like carrots and beets and things like that

1189
00:47:45.256 --> 00:47:47.304
are very concentrated in carbohydrates.

1190
00:47:47.304 --> 00:47:49.246
So the sugar high and sugar low

1191
00:47:49.246 --> 00:47:51.891
or an erratic nervous system.

1192
00:47:51.891 --> 00:47:54.856
Because the vegetable juices

1193
00:47:54.856 --> 00:47:57.629
will go right in and get into the body quickly.

1194
00:47:57.629 --> 00:48:00.637
So I suggest adding a little bit of cream

1195
00:48:00.637 --> 00:48:03.155
or raw egg into it.

1196
00:48:03.155 --> 00:48:04.883
<v Interviewer>Coconut even, raw coconut?</v>

1197
00:48:04.883 --> 00:48:06.568
<v ->Coconut cream, yes. Or using coconut</v>

1198
00:48:06.568 --> 00:48:08.253
but coconut cream is preferable.

1199
00:48:08.253 --> 00:48:11.539
Some fat to slow it down in the processing

1200
00:48:11.539 --> 00:48:13.693
and absorption into the body.

1201
00:48:13.693 --> 00:48:16.189
Well vegetable juice I found

1202
00:48:16.189 --> 00:48:18.109
is very important because a lot of people

1203
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:19.688
I found lack digestive enzymes.

1204
00:48:19.688 --> 00:48:22.290
And enzymes to get the body motivated.

1205
00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:24.914
Instead of going to coffee or soda

1206
00:48:24.914 --> 00:48:27.816
or caffeine, or nicotine, anything like that,

1207
00:48:27.816 --> 00:48:29.970
to give them a boost in the morning.

1208
00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:31.314
It's a false boost.

1209
00:48:31.314 --> 00:48:33.405
It's like taking cocaine or any other drug,

1210
00:48:33.405 --> 00:48:34.706
it's a false boost,

1211
00:48:34.706 --> 00:48:36.584
it isnt a healthy energy boost.

1212
00:48:36.584 --> 00:48:39.655
It's an irritation boost that causes

1213
00:48:39.655 --> 00:48:41.255
adrenaline to hit the blood.

1214
00:48:41.255 --> 00:48:44.221
So you're stimulated by adrenaline

1215
00:48:44.221 --> 00:48:47.229
rather than good healthy metabolism.

1216
00:48:47.229 --> 00:48:49.853
<v Interviewer>Which your vegetable juices will do, right?</v>

1217
00:48:49.853 --> 00:48:51.965
<v ->No they will provide the nutrients</v>

1218
00:48:51.965 --> 00:48:54.205
to help digest the foods.

1219
00:48:54.205 --> 00:48:55.378
<v Interviewer>To help digest the foods.</v>

1220
00:48:55.378 --> 00:48:56.637
Okay, so it's the enzyme mash.

1221
00:48:56.637 --> 00:48:58.258
<v ->Right, so it's just the enzymatic activity,</v>

1222
00:48:58.258 --> 00:48:59.410
it's also full of vitamins.

1223
00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:01.436
<v Interviewer>and minerals.</v>

1224
00:49:01.436 --> 00:49:02.933
<v ->And minerals, supplements</v>

1225
00:49:02.933 --> 00:49:05.070
so I say everybody

1226
00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:06.791
should have that little cheese

1227
00:49:06.791 --> 00:49:07.941
in the morning to absorb toxins

1228
00:49:07.941 --> 00:49:09.819
that they detoxed during the night.

1229
00:49:09.819 --> 00:49:11.547
Ten minutes after that a little

1230
00:49:11.547 --> 00:49:12.634
vegetable juice with a little fat

1231
00:49:12.634 --> 00:49:13.893
or egg in it.

1232
00:49:13.893 --> 00:49:15.642
And to drink that and

1233
00:49:15.642 --> 00:49:17.712
that will invigorate them and get

1234
00:49:17.712 --> 00:49:19.845
them moving and then a meat meal next.

1235
00:49:19.845 --> 00:49:24.709
So the body isn't making it's fuel

1236
00:49:24.889 --> 00:49:27.996
from carbohydrates which causes a stickiness

1237
00:49:28.836 --> 00:49:30.985
that makes spots slow, lags,

1238
00:49:30.985 --> 00:49:35.038
makes the blood flow slowly, sticky,

1239
00:49:35.038 --> 00:49:37.545
neurological fluid, the lymphatic fluid.

1240
00:49:37.685 --> 00:49:40.153
So when you're having pyruvate

1241
00:49:40.153 --> 00:49:43.908
you don't have all that glycogen byproduct

1242
00:49:43.908 --> 00:49:45.785
like advanced lication end product

1243
00:49:45.785 --> 00:49:48.131
that causes a weakness

1244
00:49:48.131 --> 00:49:50.713
or coming down in energy.

1245
00:49:50.713 --> 00:49:52.462
So when you eat raw meat.

1246
00:49:52.462 --> 00:49:54.467
The body makes pryuvate

1247
00:49:54.467 --> 00:49:57.027
and it doesn't have all those

1248
00:49:57.027 --> 00:49:59.758
carbohydrate byproducts.

1249
00:49:59.758 --> 00:50:02.873
<v Interviewer>So in kind of summarizing this area.</v>

1250
00:50:02.873 --> 00:50:04.537
It seems to me what happened is

1251
00:50:04.537 --> 00:50:07.438
not only your body was able to heal itself

1252
00:50:07.438 --> 00:50:09.080
just to an extraordinary level,

1253
00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.278
but also you found your own disposition

1254
00:50:11.278 --> 00:50:13.027
your own mental functioning.

1255
00:50:13.027 --> 00:50:14.627
More calm, more clear.

1256
00:50:14.627 --> 00:50:15.950
Is that?

1257
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:17.955
<v ->Yes. And I've experimented</v>

1258
00:50:17.955 --> 00:50:21.198
with eating different foods at different times of the day

1259
00:50:21.198 --> 00:50:24.882
with myself and literally thousands of people

1260
00:50:25.763 --> 00:50:28.942
over the past 42 years, 40 years.

1261
00:50:28.942 --> 00:50:32.263
Even when I was traveling on a bicycle,

1262
00:50:32.781 --> 00:50:34.317
because I was a vegetarian,

1263
00:50:34.317 --> 00:50:38.659
vegetarians have to be evangelistic.

1264
00:50:40.609 --> 00:50:42.253
So I was always telling people

1265
00:50:42.253 --> 00:50:43.768
that they had to be vegetarians.

1266
00:50:43.768 --> 00:50:46.072
Eat raw food and be healthier.

1267
00:50:46.072 --> 00:50:48.291
I was helping some people.

1268
00:50:48.291 --> 00:50:52.152
They wouldn't go into the vegetarianism like I did it.

1269
00:50:52.152 --> 00:50:53.965
But they started eating more raw foods

1270
00:50:53.965 --> 00:50:55.292
and they would get healthier.

1271
00:50:55.292 --> 00:50:56.568
<v Interviewer>And that's a good thing.</v>

1272
00:50:56.568 --> 00:50:57.207
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1273
00:50:57.207 --> 00:50:58.423
<v Interviewer>So let's talk about the politics.</v>

1274
00:50:58.423 --> 00:51:00.151
I mean, I've heard radio interviews with you

1275
00:51:00.151 --> 00:51:01.730
and you're very well versed in a lot.

1276
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:04.695
Because one thing that comes up regularly is,

1277
00:51:04.695 --> 00:51:07.468
"Get rid of the raw, get rid of the raw foods,

1278
00:51:07.468 --> 00:51:08.599
"get rid of the raw milk."

1279
00:51:08.599 --> 00:51:10.796
Because we're in the state of California

1280
00:51:10.796 --> 00:51:11.969
where you can still buy raw milk.

1281
00:51:11.969 --> 00:51:13.975
But it comes up, it seems almost every year

1282
00:51:13.975 --> 00:51:15.553
it's threatened to bring it up in the

1283
00:51:15.553 --> 00:51:17.708
state legislature to get rid of it.

1284
00:51:17.708 --> 00:51:20.481
But it's not just raw milk, everything,

1285
00:51:20.481 --> 00:51:22.465
I know we don't have time to go

1286
00:51:22.465 --> 00:51:24.983
into the Codex Alimentarius or any of that

1287
00:51:24.983 --> 00:51:27.372
and you have your own view on supplementation.

1288
00:51:28.212 --> 00:51:32.662
But what in the big picture do you see happening

1289
00:51:32.662 --> 00:51:36.773
on a governmental agency level?

1290
00:51:38.955 --> 00:51:41.600
<v ->Well, the government is all run by corporations.</v>

1291
00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.779
Of course your chemical industries are the biggest.

1292
00:51:46.189 --> 00:51:50.581
The last 12 FDA heads were all either,

1293
00:51:50.581 --> 00:51:55.581
were all either a CEO on a pharmaceutical company

1294
00:51:58.189 --> 00:52:01.282
or a chemical company.

1295
00:52:01.282 --> 00:52:03.095
Dalton, Santos, one of those,

1296
00:52:03.095 --> 00:52:05.677
or they went to that position

1297
00:52:05.677 --> 00:52:07.377
after they got out of office.

1298
00:52:08.237 --> 00:52:09.538
<v Interviewer>So they're pushing</v>

1299
00:52:09.538 --> 00:52:10.733
for whole different agendas here.

1300
00:52:10.733 --> 00:52:11.565
<v ->Oh yes.</v>

1301
00:52:11.565 --> 00:52:12.845
<v Interviewer>The chemicalization of humanity.</v>

1302
00:52:12.845 --> 00:52:15.219
<v ->To me what is happening is,</v>

1303
00:52:15.219 --> 00:52:17.480
they want to make a lot of money,

1304
00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:20.120
they want to keep control of people.

1305
00:52:20.552 --> 00:52:22.899
So how do you keep control of people?

1306
00:52:22.899 --> 00:52:24.157
You keep them procreating,

1307
00:52:24.157 --> 00:52:25.565
you keep them in credit,

1308
00:52:25.565 --> 00:52:27.479
and you keep them unhealthy.

1309
00:52:29.128 --> 00:52:31.709
They'll always be in fear of something

1310
00:52:31.709 --> 00:52:33.267
because they're not going to be well.

1311
00:52:33.267 --> 00:52:35.848
They're not going to be stable mentally or emotinally.

1312
00:52:35.848 --> 00:52:38.365
So if they can't get foods that will

1313
00:52:38.365 --> 00:52:40.520
help them calm and relax and be at peace

1314
00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.269
they're going to be running to a doctor.

1315
00:52:42.269 --> 00:52:45.341
And especially with commercials are all over lying

1316
00:52:45.341 --> 00:52:48.754
deceitful, completely fraudulent commercials

1317
00:52:48.754 --> 00:52:52.040
that the government completely ordains.

1318
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:57.160
These conditioned people, that if they get a sniffle,

1319
00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:01.267
it could be cancer it could be a major problem

1320
00:53:01.267 --> 00:53:03.358
that is going to cause you a heart attack

1321
00:53:03.358 --> 00:53:05.960
or serious disease, so run to your doctor.

1322
00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:08.435
And the doctor has no therapies,

1323
00:53:08.435 --> 00:53:12.453
not one, even investigative testing

1324
00:53:12.873 --> 00:53:15.304
methods that aren't harmful.

1325
00:53:15.304 --> 00:53:16.898
All of them are.

1326
00:53:17.359 --> 00:53:19.727
And one time I talked to the doctor about that

1327
00:53:19.727 --> 00:53:21.668
and he said, "Well we didn't take an oath

1328
00:53:21.668 --> 00:53:25.017
"when we took the Hippocratic oath,

1329
00:53:25.017 --> 00:53:28.473
"there was no Bible, so we really didn't

1330
00:53:28.473 --> 00:53:30.073
"swear to anything."

1331
00:53:30.073 --> 00:53:31.161
<v Interviewer>Wow.</v>

1332
00:53:31.161 --> 00:53:32.654
<v ->That was the attitude.</v>

1333
00:53:32.654 --> 00:53:34.617
Think about what you're dealing with, with doctors.

1334
00:53:34.617 --> 00:53:39.225
And doctors all are run by the pharmaceutical industry,

1335
00:53:39.225 --> 00:53:43.577
pharmaceutical industry writes all the medical procedures,

1336
00:53:43.577 --> 00:53:46.734
there's no independence there.

1337
00:53:46.734 --> 00:53:49.443
<v Interviewer>That's true, that continuing education,</v>

1338
00:53:49.443 --> 00:53:52.387
in fact the curriculum is written in large part

1339
00:53:52.387 --> 00:53:53.795
by pharmaceutical companies.

1340
00:53:53.795 --> 00:53:55.033
<v ->And if you have raw milk,</v>

1341
00:53:55.033 --> 00:53:56.633
you can't make people sick easily.

1342
00:53:56.633 --> 00:53:59.022
<v Interviewer>Now, so who has generally</v>

1343
00:53:59.022 --> 00:54:01.625
been behind the introduction to this

1344
00:54:01.625 --> 00:54:04.206
legislation that comes up year after year after year?

1345
00:54:04.206 --> 00:54:07.577
<v ->Well you've always got your little puppets.</v>

1346
00:54:08.947 --> 00:54:12.888
And your health departments in Califonia we

1347
00:54:12.888 --> 00:54:17.562
had a professor at USC, John Leedom,

1348
00:54:17.822 --> 00:54:20.668
and I don't mind telling his name

1349
00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:22.423
because he's one of the biggest

1350
00:54:22.423 --> 00:54:26.897
unintelligent intelligent people I know.

1351
00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:30.700
So I can say he is intelligent, he has a good flexible mind,

1352
00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.556
but he has no common sense.

1353
00:54:32.556 --> 00:54:35.564
And nor he can't even sift through anything.

1354
00:54:35.564 --> 00:54:37.783
He headed it for a long time.

1355
00:54:37.783 --> 00:54:40.983
And he became the president of the

1356
00:54:40.983 --> 00:54:42.497
American Medical, I mean,

1357
00:54:42.497 --> 00:54:46.871
the Los Angeles County Medical Milk Commission.

1358
00:54:46.871 --> 00:54:49.682
And he vowed to outlaw raw milk.

1359
00:54:49.964 --> 00:54:53.441
Well I got together with a lot of information

1360
00:54:53.441 --> 00:54:57.281
and I wrote a report that Dr. Douglas

1361
00:54:57.281 --> 00:55:01.057
allowed me to use 80% of his information

1362
00:55:01.057 --> 00:55:03.596
and 20% of my research and I wrote a report

1363
00:55:03.596 --> 00:55:06.732
that he allowed me to author.

1364
00:55:10.402 --> 00:55:15.372
And that was used to get the law changed

1365
00:55:15.372 --> 00:55:18.024
in California to the point where guess what,

1366
00:55:18.024 --> 00:55:20.798
in Los Angeles County, where we didn't need

1367
00:55:20.798 --> 00:55:22.057
the medical milk commission anymore.

1368
00:55:22.057 --> 00:55:25.342
Well he lost his job because we got rid of the commission.

1369
00:55:25.342 --> 00:55:28.008
<v Interviewer>Good, congratulations.</v>

1370
00:55:28.008 --> 00:55:29.224
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1371
00:55:29.224 --> 00:55:32.424
<v Interviewer>And now your -- and by the way,</v>

1372
00:55:32.424 --> 00:55:34.750
raw milk is delicious.

1373
00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:36.094
<v ->It tastes incredible.</v>

1374
00:55:36.094 --> 00:55:38.227
<v Interviewer>I've had it in India, where the cows</v>

1375
00:55:38.227 --> 00:55:39.784
are eating garbage off the street.

1376
00:55:39.784 --> 00:55:41.149
And there's your little cafe you're

1377
00:55:41.149 --> 00:55:43.369
going to have your breakfast at in the morning

1378
00:55:43.369 --> 00:55:45.481
you know where that milk came from,

1379
00:55:45.481 --> 00:55:48.232
just earlier that morning and it was delicious.

1380
00:55:48.232 --> 00:55:50.963
But here, it feels a little safer here,

1381
00:55:50.963 --> 00:55:52.179
just our perception.

1382
00:55:52.179 --> 00:55:53.949
But you have, you're now involved

1383
00:55:53.949 --> 00:55:57.960
in working with dairy farmers to

1384
00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:01.288
distribute in this area, there's distribution

1385
00:56:01.288 --> 00:56:04.381
for the people who follow your diet.

1386
00:56:04.381 --> 00:56:05.832
So they can find raw products,

1387
00:56:05.832 --> 00:56:07.602
but this isn't in most states.

1388
00:56:07.602 --> 00:56:10.562
Most states you can't find raw dairy still.

1389
00:56:10.674 --> 00:56:12.616
<v ->I know, anybody can put it together.</v>

1390
00:56:12.616 --> 00:56:14.386
There are farmers in every state,

1391
00:56:14.386 --> 00:56:16.712
they just have to be educated.

1392
00:56:16.712 --> 00:56:19.720
There are a lot of people who have taken my book,

1393
00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:21.682
"We Want to Live" and

1394
00:56:21.682 --> 00:56:24.221
"The Recipe for Living Without Disease"

1395
00:56:24.221 --> 00:56:26.183
and given them to farmers,

1396
00:56:26.183 --> 00:56:28.062
and once a farmer's read that, he says,

1397
00:56:28.062 --> 00:56:29.682
"Oh my God, milk will do this?

1398
00:56:29.682 --> 00:56:31.261
"My butter will do that?"

1399
00:56:31.261 --> 00:56:32.818
And then all of a sudden they take

1400
00:56:32.818 --> 00:56:34.418
a stand against the government.

1401
00:56:34.418 --> 00:56:37.063
They realize the government is harming the people.

1402
00:56:37.973 --> 00:56:41.906
And intentionally, getting rid of the good foods.

1403
00:56:41.906 --> 00:56:46.322
[Interviewer] Yes, so people we'll have

1404
00:56:46.322 --> 00:56:49.521
all the information to contact you on your page

1405
00:56:49.521 --> 00:56:50.737
your organization.

1406
00:56:50.737 --> 00:56:52.913
To start researching for themselves,

1407
00:56:52.913 --> 00:56:55.879
reading the books, and I just want to say

1408
00:56:55.879 --> 00:56:58.225
I really appreciate the courage

1409
00:56:58.225 --> 00:57:00.145
it's taken to get this far in life, and go through

1410
00:57:00.145 --> 00:57:02.727
this journey even starting with

1411
00:57:02.727 --> 00:57:04.348
eating that little jackrabbit

1412
00:57:04.348 --> 00:57:06.183
an avowed vegetarian.

1413
00:57:06.183 --> 00:57:07.249
<v ->It wasn't a little rabbit,</v>

1414
00:57:07.249 --> 00:57:08.550
it was a seven and a half pound rabbit.

1415
00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:10.620
<v Interviewer>Seven and a half pound rabbit as an avowed</v>

1416
00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:13.990
philosphical vegetarian, that could not have been easy,

1417
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:15.398
but when you're starving to death

1418
00:57:15.398 --> 00:57:18.066
and dying, and some animals have offered

1419
00:57:18.066 --> 00:57:20.113
you something and you're intuitive,

1420
00:57:20.113 --> 00:57:22.140
I guess it can take people in places

1421
00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:23.654
they never dreamed they would go.

1422
00:57:23.654 --> 00:57:25.937
And it's really been a pleasure talking with you.

1423
00:57:25.937 --> 00:57:30.048
And is there any final thought at all here?

1424
00:57:30.907 --> 00:57:33.297
<v ->Yeah, just realize that 99% of</v>

1425
00:57:33.297 --> 00:57:35.345
what the medical profession pharmaceutical

1426
00:57:35.345 --> 00:57:38.481
houses say is a lie, do just the opposite,

1427
00:57:38.481 --> 00:57:41.355
just exactly the opposite and you will be right.

1428
00:57:42.833 --> 00:57:45.344
