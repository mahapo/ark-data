(mysterious instrumental music)

2
00:00:05.936 --> 00:00:08.736
<v ->Lynne Kitei was enjoying a very successful career</v>

3
00:00:08.736 --> 00:00:11.832
as a medical doctor and as a chief medical consultant

4
00:00:11.832 --> 00:00:14.850
for the Wellness Center at the Arizona Heart Institute.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.210
Throughout her career, she was also regularly featured

6
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.648
in television and radio programs as an educator

7
00:00:19.648 --> 00:00:21.546
in her field, but one day,

8
00:00:21.546 --> 00:00:24.046
while looking out the window of her North Phoenix home,

9
00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:26.852
an unexpected phenomena entered her life.

10
00:00:26.852 --> 00:00:29.592
She noticed something on the horizon and began taking photos

11
00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:31.168
that could not be explained.

12
00:00:31.168 --> 00:00:33.828
Alert to the fact that something unusual was occurring,

13
00:00:33.828 --> 00:00:35.608
Lynne had the photos analyzed,

14
00:00:35.608 --> 00:00:38.608
and began asking questions of all the right authorities

15
00:00:38.608 --> 00:00:39.806
in what was to become known

16
00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:42.900
as one of the most celebrated UFO sightings in history,

17
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.379
the Phoenix Lights.

18
00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:45.818
The result of her inquiry

19
00:00:45.818 --> 00:00:49.218
is one of the best documented case histories of this event,

20
00:00:49.218 --> 00:00:51.416
which is captured in her book and documentary

21
00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:53.702
by the same title, The Phoenix Lights.

22
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.630
<v Voiceover>Dr. Lynne, for those people</v>

23
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.508
who have not already heard about,

24
00:00:59.508 --> 00:01:01.961
and if they have been fully versed in the subject

25
00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:05.192
of the Phoenix Lights, let's just lay the foundation

26
00:01:05.192 --> 00:01:09.736
with what happened on the night of March 13th, 1997.

27
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.421
<v ->On March 13th, 1997, while thousands of people</v>

28
00:01:14.421 --> 00:01:17.451
were out actually looking up at the sky for a glimpse

29
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:20.620
of the Hale-Bopp Comet, they also caught a glimpse

30
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.619
of a mile to two-mile wide formation of these lights.

31
00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.655
Some people would say they were orbs,

32
00:01:26.655 --> 00:01:30.195
others would say they were canisters of swimming light

33
00:01:30.195 --> 00:01:31.693
when they went right over their head,

34
00:01:31.693 --> 00:01:35.193
gliding, very low altitude, silently

35
00:01:35.193 --> 00:01:36.631
across the entire state.

36
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:41.289
Actually, it went mainly through the most populated corridor

37
00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.021
of Arizona, although, we have reports

38
00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:47.717
as early as 5:20 PM

39
00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:50.797
to as late as 5:30 the next morning,

40
00:01:50.797 --> 00:01:54.317
when I was told by a crew from Boeing

41
00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:58.315
that they actually saw this phenomena appear by the airport.

42
00:01:58.315 --> 00:02:01.916
So there were many hours of these phenomena

43
00:02:01.916 --> 00:02:04.313
and many things going on, actually.

44
00:02:04.313 --> 00:02:06.089
Not just one or two events,

45
00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:08.049
as you probably heard in the media,

46
00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:09.490
but many events.

47
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.737
There actually is a compilation 12 years in the making

48
00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:15.787
that we call the GAP,

49
00:02:15.787 --> 00:02:17.727
Geospatial Animation Project,

50
00:02:17.727 --> 00:02:19.445
from reports, hundreds of reports,

51
00:02:19.445 --> 00:02:22.425
from the UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Washington,

52
00:02:22.425 --> 00:02:25.905
to Councilwoman Frances Barwood at the time,

53
00:02:25.905 --> 00:02:29.709
as well as to (mumbles), which was a clearing house

54
00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.049
of the Phoenix Lights information during that period,

55
00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.509
as well as Arizona MUFON,

56
00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.869
and from multiple witness reports,

57
00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:43.503
there were actually about nine different kinds of craft

58
00:02:43.503 --> 00:02:46.021
that people saw traversing throughout the state,

59
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:49.861
in addition to orbs separate from the craft,

60
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:52.315
or these orbs would detach from the main object,

61
00:02:52.315 --> 00:02:55.071
go out into the environment, and then re-dock with it,

62
00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:58.129
so there were many things going on

63
00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.007
during the March 13th incident

64
00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:02.045
that make it one of the most important

65
00:03:02.045 --> 00:03:04.181
and most documented mass sightings--

66
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:05.759
<v Voiceover>Certainly most witnessed.</v>

67
00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:07.723
Isn't it considered to be the most witnessed

68
00:03:07.723 --> 00:03:08.956
of all UFO sightings?

69
00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:10.776
<v ->Absolutely, at this point,</v>

70
00:03:10.776 --> 00:03:14.234
it's probably well over 10,000 people saw it

71
00:03:14.234 --> 00:03:15.832
throughout the state and we're talking people

72
00:03:15.832 --> 00:03:18.630
from all walks of life, and again, many people were outside.

73
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.428
It was a beautiful, clear night,

74
00:03:20.428 --> 00:03:22.286
and looking purposely at the sky.

75
00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:26.506
So whoever did this, seemed to want to be seen,

76
00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:30.766
and it was a very non-threatening, gentle way

77
00:03:30.766 --> 00:03:33.406
of just gliding, in fact, some people

78
00:03:33.406 --> 00:03:37.326
even had messages, telepathic messages.

79
00:03:37.326 --> 00:03:39.981
"Don't worry, we're not here to hurt you,"

80
00:03:39.981 --> 00:03:41.399
and felt very safe.

81
00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:44.439
That was one point that really got to me as a physician,

82
00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:46.539
when I started looking into the data,

83
00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:48.359
and started interviewing the witnesses,

84
00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.759
is that across the board, no one,

85
00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.579
no one was fearful.

86
00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.294
If anything, people were joyful

87
00:03:54.294 --> 00:03:56.611
and "Oh my goodness, this is miraculous!"

88
00:03:56.611 --> 00:04:00.191
and that was consistently the reaction in real time

89
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:02.709
and actually long term.

90
00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.237
I did a study of witnesses that actually

91
00:04:07.687 --> 00:04:11.101
came to me and said that they had had near-death experiences

92
00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:15.317
as children that was reawakened by the mass sighting,

93
00:04:15.317 --> 00:04:18.177
and I found that really curious 'cause I did, too.

94
00:04:18.177 --> 00:04:21.415
And I thought, jeez, could there possibly be a connection

95
00:04:21.415 --> 00:04:23.433
between all unexplained phenomena,

96
00:04:23.433 --> 00:04:26.553
be it near-death experience, out of body experience,

97
00:04:26.553 --> 00:04:29.593
unexplained aerial phenomena that have a mystical light

98
00:04:29.593 --> 00:04:32.313
associated with the experience.

99
00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:34.131
Lo and behold, when I started looking,

100
00:04:34.131 --> 00:04:36.189
and I really did a meticulous investigation

101
00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:38.329
to try to find a logical explanation

102
00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:40.069
for not only the mass sighting

103
00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:42.207
and what I saw up close and personal,

104
00:04:42.207 --> 00:04:45.045
but also, this really took me on a new road.

105
00:04:45.045 --> 00:04:48.063
I found that university studies, the Omega Project

106
00:04:48.063 --> 00:04:50.181
at University of Connecticut, Kenneth Ring,

107
00:04:50.181 --> 00:04:53.626
Dr. Kenneth Ring, as well as Dr. Sue Atuemblo

108
00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:56.140
and Bruce Greyson, Dr. Bruce Greyson,

109
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.680
and many studies were being done,

110
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.570
Ray Fowler, Dr. Ray Fowler as well,

111
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.116
on the poignant connection,

112
00:05:04.116 --> 00:05:06.797
not only in the experience itself,

113
00:05:06.797 --> 00:05:09.046
but was most profound to me,

114
00:05:09.046 --> 00:05:10.541
and I was hearing it over and over again,

115
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:12.801
certainly from the Phoenix Lights witnesses,

116
00:05:12.801 --> 00:05:15.801
was the profound positive aftereffect

117
00:05:15.801 --> 00:05:19.041
that happened within an individual who truly experienced

118
00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:21.736
what I started calling an UP, unexplained phenomena,

119
00:05:21.736 --> 00:05:25.287
U-P, an UP, because they are an UP.

120
00:05:25.287 --> 00:05:28.871
The awakenedness, the enlightenment that happens

121
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:30.671
within an individual,

122
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:33.547
connectiveness to the universe, and to the earth

123
00:05:33.547 --> 00:05:36.362
and to each other that is felt to the core.

124
00:05:36.362 --> 00:05:39.422
It really does change people forever

125
00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:42.723
once they have an UP experience.

126
00:05:42.723 --> 00:05:45.278
<v Voiceover>And I just interviewed Raymond Moody,</v>

127
00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:47.778
and this is the same thing he talks about

128
00:05:47.778 --> 00:05:50.169
as this quality of light and this quality of love

129
00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:51.943
that seems to permeate all those experiences

130
00:05:51.943 --> 00:05:53.573
that seem to be, as you say,

131
00:05:53.573 --> 00:05:55.624
there are these crossover effects,

132
00:05:55.624 --> 00:05:57.019
whether it's a near-death experience,

133
00:05:57.019 --> 00:06:00.819
out of body experience or contact of this nature,

134
00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:03.045
it seems that there are these truths

135
00:06:03.045 --> 00:06:05.885
that ring through all of these, and for you,

136
00:06:05.885 --> 00:06:08.185
what I found really interesting in reading your book

137
00:06:08.185 --> 00:06:11.295
is there were some precursors to this event

138
00:06:11.295 --> 00:06:12.980
that were setting the stage for you

139
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.867
because you did not come into this,

140
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.801
you were reluctant to come and take on this subject.

141
00:06:20.976 --> 00:06:24.461
Ufology was not your thing, and yet at the same time,

142
00:06:24.461 --> 00:06:25.879
you'd had some pretty profound things

143
00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:28.179
that had happened to you, and one of them,

144
00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:32.579
if you would start with, was on your birthday eve,

145
00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:34.699
two years prior to the sighting,

146
00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.835
you had another profound event and it was shared.

147
00:06:37.835 --> 00:06:41.593
<v ->Yes, I have asked myself and done a lot of soul searching,</v>

148
00:06:41.593 --> 00:06:42.953
asking if there is a connection

149
00:06:42.953 --> 00:06:45.593
not only in other unexplained phenomena

150
00:06:45.593 --> 00:06:48.753
but a connection to what has happened in my own life

151
00:06:48.753 --> 00:06:50.373
to what is happening now,

152
00:06:50.373 --> 00:06:53.779
and I view it all as a healthy skeptic,

153
00:06:54.553 --> 00:06:56.689
always looking for a logical explanation,

154
00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:59.069
but the data speaks for itself,

155
00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:03.129
and when I did have a very close sighting

156
00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:05.789
two years before the mass sighting,

157
00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:08.827
on the eve of my birthday, and I did get pictures of it,

158
00:07:08.827 --> 00:07:11.647
I couldn't be here now if I didn't,

159
00:07:11.647 --> 00:07:14.201
it really set that feeling in motion.

160
00:07:14.201 --> 00:07:16.599
Is there a connection?

161
00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:20.817
What happened on February 6th, 1995

162
00:07:20.817 --> 00:07:24.613
is actually, my husband called me out of the bath,

163
00:07:24.613 --> 00:07:26.901
one wall of our bedroom is a window

164
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:29.179
and we have a panoramic view,

165
00:07:29.179 --> 00:07:31.015
if we're standing anywhere in our bedroom,

166
00:07:31.015 --> 00:07:32.214
of the city skyline,

167
00:07:32.214 --> 00:07:34.851
so we're very familiar with what planes and helicopters

168
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:37.749
and street lights and car lights look like and so forth,

169
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:41.367
and he not only is a physician

170
00:07:41.367 --> 00:07:44.965
but also on several state and medical boards at the time,

171
00:07:44.965 --> 00:07:48.804
not one to be ruffled, and he sounded alarmed.

172
00:07:48.804 --> 00:07:49.860
He said, "Get over here, quick,"

173
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.521
and I grabbed a towel and ran over to the window

174
00:07:52.521 --> 00:07:54.150
and a little below us

175
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.136
'cause we're pretty high on the mountain,

176
00:07:56.136 --> 00:07:58.066
behind a private residence,

177
00:07:58.066 --> 00:08:01.606
was three amber orbs

178
00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:04.886
in a triangle formation, actually a pyramid,

179
00:08:04.886 --> 00:08:07.982
one on top and two very closely aligned underneath,

180
00:08:07.982 --> 00:08:10.362
and as soon as I saw them, it was like,

181
00:08:10.362 --> 00:08:12.997
"Whoa, what is that?" and I wanted to run

182
00:08:12.997 --> 00:08:15.977
and get my video camera, but it was downstairs

183
00:08:15.977 --> 00:08:17.576
and I didn't know how long it would last,

184
00:08:17.576 --> 00:08:19.593
so I tried to take everything in mentally,

185
00:08:19.593 --> 00:08:21.453
the size, the shape, the color.

186
00:08:21.453 --> 00:08:24.272
They were about three to six feet each,

187
00:08:24.272 --> 00:08:27.873
and they were oval-shaped, like an egg on its side,

188
00:08:27.873 --> 00:08:31.928
and the color within each orb was very different

189
00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:34.464
than any other amber color I had ever seen.

190
00:08:34.464 --> 00:08:38.384
It was uniform amber color, very mesmerizing,

191
00:08:38.384 --> 00:08:40.604
very soft, it didn't glare at all.

192
00:08:40.604 --> 00:08:44.304
Every other light out there glared, I noticed immediately,

193
00:08:44.304 --> 00:08:46.784
and I though to myself if I don't get a picture of this,

194
00:08:46.784 --> 00:08:49.100
nobody's gonna believe it, and I go running to the closet

195
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.756
to get my 35 millimeter that I take our beautiful sunsets,

196
00:08:52.756 --> 00:08:54.652
and my husband calls me back, he says,

197
00:08:54.652 --> 00:08:58.372
"Get over here, quick, one of them is disappearing,"

198
00:08:58.372 --> 00:09:01.346
and as we both watched, it was just extraordinary,

199
00:09:01.346 --> 00:09:04.767
it's really almost difficult to explain

200
00:09:04.767 --> 00:09:07.984
but the top orb, without budging,

201
00:09:07.984 --> 00:09:10.104
it didn't budge at all, I mean, this was intelligence

202
00:09:10.104 --> 00:09:12.084
behind this phenomena,

203
00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:15.824
started to dim but not even dimming,

204
00:09:15.824 --> 00:09:18.880
it was dimming but it was getting smaller and smaller

205
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.960
and smaller and smaller in a mechanical way

206
00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.458
until it was almost a dot, and then it was gone,

207
00:09:25.458 --> 00:09:27.978
but it still felt like it was there.

208
00:09:27.978 --> 00:09:28.770
That, it was very strange.

209
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.709
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

210
00:09:30.709 --> 00:09:32.509
<v ->You know, did it go to another dimension,</v>

211
00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:35.889
I mean, I had no interest or knowledge in this topic at all,

212
00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:38.247
so this was totally new to me,

213
00:09:38.247 --> 00:09:41.627
this was fantastic, so I get down on the balcony

214
00:09:41.627 --> 00:09:45.383
and immediately clicked a picture of the two lower orbs,

215
00:09:45.383 --> 00:09:49.441
and noticed an eerie silence, as if time had stopped.

216
00:09:49.441 --> 00:09:50.619
It was just bizarre.

217
00:09:50.619 --> 00:09:53.979
I mean it was just bizarre, and as I'm watching

218
00:09:53.979 --> 00:09:55.899
these two bottom orbs intently,

219
00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:57.677
it felt as if something was watching me.

220
00:09:57.677 --> 00:09:58.895
I didn't mention that to a soul

221
00:09:58.895 --> 00:10:01.833
until after the mass sighting two years later,

222
00:10:01.833 --> 00:10:04.511
but going through my mind at the time was,

223
00:10:04.511 --> 00:10:06.269
"Who are you, what are you, do you know that I'm here?

224
00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:08.209
"I'd love to meet you."

225
00:10:08.209 --> 00:10:09.167
The next thing I remember,

226
00:10:09.167 --> 00:10:11.965
the left bottom orb starting to dissipate

227
00:10:11.965 --> 00:10:14.125
just like the top one had,

228
00:10:14.125 --> 00:10:16.125
and I quickly shot a picture of that,

229
00:10:16.125 --> 00:10:18.785
and that was the only picture that turned out at the time,

230
00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.525
but for me, not only did it confirm

231
00:10:21.525 --> 00:10:24.485
that something unusual happened and it was pretty close,

232
00:10:24.485 --> 00:10:27.845
but I happened to get it in action.

233
00:10:27.845 --> 00:10:31.475
I caught the bottom left orb half disappeared

234
00:10:31.475 --> 00:10:33.175
and one is still there,

235
00:10:33.175 --> 00:10:34.973
but I didn't even know who to show it to.

236
00:10:34.973 --> 00:10:38.013
I knew no one associated with this topic at all,

237
00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:41.733
so I wondered for two years, a number of things,

238
00:10:41.733 --> 00:10:44.313
why I saw it on the eve of my birthday,

239
00:10:44.313 --> 00:10:47.071
that's why I remember the day, actually.

240
00:10:47.071 --> 00:10:48.909
This was kind of a cool birthday present.

241
00:10:48.909 --> 00:10:50.409
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

242
00:10:50.409 --> 00:10:52.549
<v ->Why my husband and I saw it together,</v>

243
00:10:52.549 --> 00:10:56.089
so that we could confirm that we did see something unusual,

244
00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:57.929
and why I had a picture of it.

245
00:10:57.929 --> 00:11:00.447
Would I ever find out what these strange,

246
00:11:00.447 --> 00:11:02.487
mysterious phenomena were?

247
00:11:02.487 --> 00:11:05.305
And then lo and behold, until two months

248
00:11:05.305 --> 00:11:07.743
before the mass sighting, I didn't see anything.

249
00:11:07.743 --> 00:11:10.483
I mean I would, like I said, if we're in our bedroom,

250
00:11:10.483 --> 00:11:13.423
we see the sea, skyline and nothing

251
00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:16.831
remotely familiar to that popped up.

252
00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:21.101
Until two months before the mass sighting,

253
00:11:21.101 --> 00:11:23.401
I was in the bedroom and I noticed,

254
00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:27.629
this was January 22nd, 1997,

255
00:11:27.941 --> 00:11:30.499
I noticed three orbs in a line formation,

256
00:11:30.499 --> 00:11:32.617
equidistant from each other, and I thought,

257
00:11:32.617 --> 00:11:36.371
whoa, they're amber but they were at a distance.

258
00:11:36.371 --> 00:11:37.889
<v Voiceover>How close were the other ones?</v>

259
00:11:37.889 --> 00:11:39.907
<v ->The other ones were only a few hundred feet from our home.</v>

260
00:11:39.907 --> 00:11:41.525
<v Voiceover>OK, close.</v>

261
00:11:41.525 --> 00:11:44.445
<v ->And they've been analyzed and all that, yes,</v>

262
00:11:44.445 --> 00:11:48.435
and I thought, jeez, you know,

263
00:11:48.435 --> 00:11:50.484
they're amber, they're in a formation

264
00:11:50.484 --> 00:11:52.141
even though they were a line formation,

265
00:11:52.141 --> 00:11:53.901
equidistant from each other,

266
00:11:53.901 --> 00:11:55.661
and they're hovering for minutes,

267
00:11:55.661 --> 00:11:59.849
strangely similar to '95 and I just noted as each one,

268
00:12:00.181 --> 00:12:03.345
again, imploded from the outside inwards

269
00:12:03.345 --> 00:12:04.965
very, very slowly.

270
00:12:04.965 --> 00:12:08.520
One, two, three, from right to left and they were out.

271
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:13.195
The next night, I happened to notice the same three orbs

272
00:12:13.195 --> 00:12:16.335
are now in front of South Mountain,

273
00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:18.195
and I knew they were in front of South Mountain

274
00:12:18.195 --> 00:12:19.845
because there's red blinking lights

275
00:12:19.845 --> 00:12:22.680
to alert planes coming into the airport

276
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.875
which is in front of South Mountains

277
00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:26.435
and north of South Mountain,

278
00:12:26.435 --> 00:12:28.554
and I thought, "OK, enough,

279
00:12:28.554 --> 00:12:29.890
"I've got to get my video camera,"

280
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.310
so I ran downstairs, grabbed it,

281
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:35.510
got out to the pool area and got about 18 seconds' worth,

282
00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.526
the battery went dead, and it was charged.

283
00:12:38.526 --> 00:12:40.626
So I went in, I hooked it up,

284
00:12:40.626 --> 00:12:42.864
went out, they were gone, this was about 8 o'clock.

285
00:12:42.864 --> 00:12:44.565
About 8:30, my husband was coming home

286
00:12:44.565 --> 00:12:47.520
from a hospital board meeting and he comes up the drive

287
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.360
and I went out and I said,

288
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.538
"You know, honey, remember I told you

289
00:12:50.538 --> 00:12:54.316
"about the three amber orbs in a line last night

290
00:12:54.316 --> 00:12:55.914
"to the northwest?

291
00:12:55.914 --> 00:12:57.092
"Well about a half an hour ago,

292
00:12:57.092 --> 00:12:58.950
"they were right in front of South Mountain,"

293
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.470
and as I'm pointing like this,

294
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.118
they reappear in the same spot.

295
00:13:03.118 --> 00:13:05.656
It's like, "Whoa, I've gotta get a picture of this,"

296
00:13:05.656 --> 00:13:07.552
and I have come, I have to say,

297
00:13:07.552 --> 00:13:11.310
I have come to the belief,

298
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.490
if it is a belief,

299
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.588
that things happen for a reason,

300
00:13:14.588 --> 00:13:16.626
and I am so thankful that my video camera

301
00:13:16.626 --> 00:13:18.324
was hooked up to the (laughs)

302
00:13:18.324 --> 00:13:20.124
to the electric because I ran upstairs

303
00:13:20.124 --> 00:13:24.364
and got my 35 millimeter and as I got out on the balcony,

304
00:13:24.364 --> 00:13:28.442
suddenly, as I'm ready to shoot the three in a row,

305
00:13:28.442 --> 00:13:31.480
six lights popped on above the three.

306
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.360
Massive span,

307
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.579
equidistant from each other, it was unnerving.

308
00:13:35.579 --> 00:13:36.516
I started to shake.

309
00:13:36.516 --> 00:13:37.754
In fact, the first picture I took,

310
00:13:37.754 --> 00:13:39.674
you can see that I was shaking

311
00:13:39.674 --> 00:13:41.634
because not having had an explanation

312
00:13:41.634 --> 00:13:44.649
for the phenomena two years before,

313
00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:47.088
now this is so massive, I thought,

314
00:13:47.088 --> 00:13:50.426
"Oh my god, is this a mother ship or a fleet,

315
00:13:50.426 --> 00:13:53.546
"what is this?" but I kept clicking away

316
00:13:53.546 --> 00:13:56.184
and I got six pictures in a row,

317
00:13:56.184 --> 00:13:59.124
actually, of these phenomena head on,

318
00:13:59.124 --> 00:14:01.180
turning into a V shape.

319
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.860
<v Voiceover>Oh, yes.</v>

320
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.638
<v ->And it was so amazing.</v>

321
00:14:04.638 --> 00:14:05.176
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

322
00:14:05.176 --> 00:14:07.270
<v ->That I did not sleep well that night, and I figured,</v>

323
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.750
"Come on, there's gotta be a logical explanation for this.

324
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.128
"I will just call around the next morning and find out

325
00:14:12.128 --> 00:14:13.607
"if anybody had seen it."

326
00:14:13.607 --> 00:14:16.807
Someone else must have seen this, it was massive,

327
00:14:16.807 --> 00:14:21.184
and I finally called the FAA at the airport

328
00:14:21.184 --> 00:14:25.533
and got air traffic controllers on the phone

329
00:14:25.533 --> 00:14:28.673
who saw the same thing at the same time

330
00:14:28.673 --> 00:14:31.933
and they were just as excited that I had seen them,

331
00:14:31.933 --> 00:14:33.992
and in fact, they were more excited than me.

332
00:14:33.992 --> 00:14:35.650
One of the fellas said, "Did you see those six lights

333
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:36.689
"that were equidistant from each other

334
00:14:36.689 --> 00:14:39.288
"hovering in a formation last night about 8:30?"

335
00:14:39.288 --> 00:14:39.968
I said, "Yes."

336
00:14:39.968 --> 00:14:42.127
He said, "Well, there were actually three at 8 o'clock."

337
00:14:42.127 --> 00:14:46.007
I said I saw them, too, and he said,

338
00:14:46.007 --> 00:14:48.301
"Well, we looked on radar and they didn't show up on radar,

339
00:14:48.301 --> 00:14:49.439
"so we took our binoculars."

340
00:14:49.439 --> 00:14:52.060
These are high-powered binoculars to look

341
00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:55.039
because it was in class B restricted airspace.

342
00:14:55.039 --> 00:14:58.438
That's a very important point,

343
00:14:58.438 --> 00:15:01.418
and anyone that's in that 30-mile radius

344
00:15:01.418 --> 00:15:04.038
around the center of the airport must call in

345
00:15:04.038 --> 00:15:06.836
to the tower to let them know they're gonna be flying,

346
00:15:06.836 --> 00:15:11.114
especially a thousand feet altitude as this was,

347
00:15:11.114 --> 00:15:12.874
but no one called in.

348
00:15:12.874 --> 00:15:15.254
So they took the binoculars to look and in his own words,

349
00:15:15.254 --> 00:15:16.934
he said there were six points of light,

350
00:15:16.934 --> 00:15:18.554
totally equidistant from each other,

351
00:15:18.554 --> 00:15:21.533
massive span, over a mile wide,

352
00:15:21.533 --> 00:15:24.852
that started turning against the wind,

353
00:15:24.852 --> 00:15:27.671
and this particular air traffic controller

354
00:15:27.671 --> 00:15:30.811
was a meteorologist, he knew what he was talking about,

355
00:15:30.811 --> 00:15:33.810
and then slowly in tandem, in synchrony,

356
00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.088
as if it was attached to something

357
00:15:35.088 --> 00:15:37.427
but they couldn't quite see what it was attached to,

358
00:15:37.427 --> 00:15:40.187
moved slowly behind South Mountain,

359
00:15:40.187 --> 00:15:42.337
so I said, "So what was it?"

360
00:15:42.337 --> 00:15:43.723
and there was silence,

361
00:15:43.723 --> 00:15:45.981
and then the fella said, "Beats me,"

362
00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:46.857
and I said, "Wait a minute,

363
00:15:46.857 --> 00:15:48.495
"you're an air traffic controller, you're supposed to know

364
00:15:48.495 --> 00:15:50.333
"what's in our airspace, especially--"

365
00:15:50.333 --> 00:15:51.932
<v Voiceover>But it wasn't showing up on radar.</v>

366
00:15:51.932 --> 00:15:53.328
<v ->Wasn't showing (mumbles)</v>

367
00:15:53.328 --> 00:15:56.669
and he was just as curious and we kept in contact

368
00:15:56.669 --> 00:16:00.182
and I continued to photograph these things

369
00:16:00.182 --> 00:16:03.898
and what was amazing to me is that I did photograph

370
00:16:03.898 --> 00:16:06.453
this phenomena straight on turning into a V

371
00:16:06.453 --> 00:16:08.789
while they were seeing it, so we saw the same thing,

372
00:16:08.789 --> 00:16:11.409
I mean the data really speaks for itself,

373
00:16:11.409 --> 00:16:14.424
but at any rate, I continued photographing these things,

374
00:16:14.424 --> 00:16:16.839
and this again is very serendipitous

375
00:16:16.839 --> 00:16:20.195
because finally it was getting ridiculous.

376
00:16:20.195 --> 00:16:23.355
I mean I was, every time I saw these lights pop up,

377
00:16:23.355 --> 00:16:28.254
I felt compelled to document them on film as a scientist,

378
00:16:28.254 --> 00:16:32.821
and eventually, when it was getting into March,

379
00:16:32.821 --> 00:16:35.719
it was like, OK, I've gotta find out what this is.

380
00:16:35.719 --> 00:16:37.719
There must be a logical explanation

381
00:16:37.719 --> 00:16:39.837
and this is how close I was.

382
00:16:39.837 --> 00:16:42.077
A friend of a friend had a neighbor

383
00:16:42.077 --> 00:16:45.187
who had a friend who knew the past president of MUFON,

384
00:16:45.187 --> 00:16:46.751
Mutual UFO Network!

385
00:16:46.751 --> 00:16:49.569
So I called him up and I said, "Look,

386
00:16:49.569 --> 00:16:52.387
"I've been seeing these orbs for weeks,"

387
00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:54.107
and he said he hadn't heard about them

388
00:16:54.107 --> 00:16:57.005
but there were people that not only had witnessed them

389
00:16:57.005 --> 00:16:59.343
as well for days before the mass sighting,

390
00:16:59.343 --> 00:17:01.501
but took video, wonderful video,

391
00:17:01.501 --> 00:17:04.221
and they look like spinning balls of energy,

392
00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:06.822
and I call them an orb because the light does not extend

393
00:17:06.822 --> 00:17:08.659
outside the edge, it's self-contained,

394
00:17:08.659 --> 00:17:10.979
like nothing you've ever seen before,

395
00:17:10.979 --> 00:17:15.239
and I said I also have a picture from '95

396
00:17:15.239 --> 00:17:17.759
that I know is authentic but I'd like someone of credence

397
00:17:17.759 --> 00:17:20.680
to take a peek at it, and he referred me

398
00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.457
to a MUFON field investigator.

399
00:17:23.457 --> 00:17:26.617
We set up an appointment for that Wednesday,

400
00:17:26.617 --> 00:17:29.617
the next week, and he calls on Tuesday to postpone

401
00:17:29.617 --> 00:17:32.197
because the then state director's mom had passed.

402
00:17:32.197 --> 00:17:33.755
That's where we get this connection again

403
00:17:33.755 --> 00:17:35.973
and the funeral happened to be that Wednesday

404
00:17:35.973 --> 00:17:38.873
and the only window of opportunity that I had

405
00:17:38.873 --> 00:17:41.253
for the next couple of weeks was Friday morning

406
00:17:41.253 --> 00:17:43.413
at 10 o'clock, he said fine.

407
00:17:43.413 --> 00:17:46.553
Well, unbeknownst to me, Thursday night,

408
00:17:46.553 --> 00:17:48.951
March 13th, there was a lot going on.

409
00:17:48.951 --> 00:17:49.691
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

410
00:17:49.691 --> 00:17:52.129
<v ->For me, it was like an ordinary night.</v>

411
00:17:52.129 --> 00:17:54.809
Here, I see one lone light,

412
00:17:54.809 --> 00:17:59.367
about 8:20, to the west, and interestingly,

413
00:17:59.367 --> 00:18:03.947
at 8:20 is when the first official call came in

414
00:18:03.947 --> 00:18:08.025
from a retired police officer in Paulden, Arizona,

415
00:18:08.025 --> 00:18:10.445
that he had seen this massive formation

416
00:18:10.445 --> 00:18:11.721
of V formation of light.

417
00:18:11.721 --> 00:18:13.801
<v Voiceover>The calls were coming in</v>

418
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:16.279
geographically as it moved.

419
00:18:16.279 --> 00:18:17.879
One community that got the calls

420
00:18:17.879 --> 00:18:19.457
and the next community and the next,

421
00:18:19.457 --> 00:18:20.895
all the way down as it passed over.

422
00:18:20.895 --> 00:18:24.135
<v ->Yes, in fact, we have a 911 police operator</v>

423
00:18:24.135 --> 00:18:26.575
who came forward recently

424
00:18:26.575 --> 00:18:29.235
that just retired, and she said,

425
00:18:29.235 --> 00:18:31.093
"You know, I hear they only said they got a few calls

426
00:18:31.093 --> 00:18:35.299
"at the police station, but you know,"

427
00:18:35.299 --> 00:18:36.067
<v Voiceover>That wasn't the case.</v>

428
00:18:36.067 --> 00:18:38.272
<v ->"I'm ready to tell the rest of the story."</v>

429
00:18:38.272 --> 00:18:40.111
And they got hundreds and hundreds of calls,

430
00:18:40.111 --> 00:18:42.030
and yes, you could tell

431
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.790
as it was coming through Phoenix,

432
00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.830
the reports were just spectacular,

433
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.990
but anyway, at 8:20, it was the first report,

434
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.639
and also at 8:20, interestingly,

435
00:18:54.689 --> 00:18:57.029
there was a call to the UFO Reporting Center

436
00:18:57.029 --> 00:19:00.929
of Peter Davenport in Seattle about 3 AM the next morning

437
00:19:00.929 --> 00:19:04.509
from an alleged crewman from Luke Air Force Base

438
00:19:04.509 --> 00:19:07.049
who reported in great detail,

439
00:19:07.049 --> 00:19:10.109
and it was recorded and we have it in our documentary

440
00:19:10.109 --> 00:19:12.589
and it's also mentioned in the book,

441
00:19:12.589 --> 00:19:15.688
that there was an object,

442
00:19:15.688 --> 00:19:18.088
a mile-wide craft,

443
00:19:18.088 --> 00:19:20.448
hovering over the center of Phoenix,

444
00:19:20.448 --> 00:19:22.448
7th Avenue and Indian School,

445
00:19:22.448 --> 00:19:25.088
and military jets were sent out

446
00:19:25.088 --> 00:19:27.207
to either intercept it or take on camera film

447
00:19:27.207 --> 00:19:30.087
and there were witnesses to confirm this,

448
00:19:30.087 --> 00:19:34.226
and as it got close, the object blinked out,

449
00:19:34.226 --> 00:19:36.506
and freaked out, actually, one of the pilots

450
00:19:36.506 --> 00:19:39.063
the crewman said he helped out of his craft

451
00:19:39.063 --> 00:19:40.801
when he got back to Luke Air Force Base

452
00:19:40.801 --> 00:19:43.680
and Luke was shut down.

453
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.339
And we do have a military fella in the documentary

454
00:19:47.339 --> 00:19:50.218
that talks about this, but anyway--

455
00:19:50.218 --> 00:19:52.778
<v Voiceover>Interesting considering it was deemed</v>

456
00:19:52.778 --> 00:19:55.357
at that time to be military illumination flares.

457
00:19:55.357 --> 00:19:57.496
<v ->Well, not yet, not yet.
(Voiceover laughs)

458
00:19:57.496 --> 00:19:59.095
That's a very interest--
<v Voiceover>A little later.</v>

459
00:19:59.095 --> 00:20:00.834
<v Lynne>Oh yeah, oh yeah.</v>

460
00:20:00.834 --> 00:20:03.073
<v Voiceover>For flares, interesting phenomena for flares.</v>

461
00:20:03.073 --> 00:20:05.532
<v ->Well, not only that, and obviously,</v>

462
00:20:05.532 --> 00:20:08.031
we're talking craft here, which has never been addressed,

463
00:20:08.031 --> 00:20:08.827
OK,

464
00:20:08.827 --> 00:20:12.827
but this was all about 8:20,

465
00:20:12.827 --> 00:20:14.827
so that's when I saw that one orb,

466
00:20:14.827 --> 00:20:17.125
and I didn't jump up 'cause I had enough in the can

467
00:20:17.125 --> 00:20:20.185
for the MUFON investigator the next morning,

468
00:20:20.185 --> 00:20:24.005
but I noted also about 8:10, 8:15,

469
00:20:24.005 --> 00:20:26.123
one lone orb far south,

470
00:20:26.123 --> 00:20:28.421
which was interesting because that's when

471
00:20:28.421 --> 00:20:32.459
witnesses were seeing this massive array of lights

472
00:20:32.459 --> 00:20:36.219
in Tucson, which is about two hours south of Phoenix,

473
00:20:36.219 --> 00:20:37.677
so that computes.

474
00:20:37.677 --> 00:20:40.497
Well, about 10 o'clock, the news was just about to start.

475
00:20:40.497 --> 00:20:42.365
They were doing the promos for the news.

476
00:20:42.365 --> 00:20:44.911
Suddenly, I see these six lights pop up again

477
00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:49.191
in the same exact location as January 23rd,

478
00:20:49.191 --> 00:20:51.711
and grab my camera, I get out there.

479
00:20:51.711 --> 00:20:54.611
By the time I got out there, three had disappeared

480
00:20:54.611 --> 00:20:57.051
and what I got on film,

481
00:20:57.051 --> 00:20:59.111
which has become one of the signature videos

482
00:20:59.111 --> 00:21:02.111
of the mass sighting, are three points of light

483
00:21:02.111 --> 00:21:04.471
that seem to be the end points

484
00:21:04.471 --> 00:21:08.171
of the massive triangle or V-shaped craft,

485
00:21:08.171 --> 00:21:11.591
which people would describe throughout the state as well.

486
00:21:11.591 --> 00:21:14.587
Some people saw a number of different orbs

487
00:21:14.587 --> 00:21:17.967
on these craft ranging from three

488
00:21:17.967 --> 00:21:21.767
to nine, and other people would see

489
00:21:21.767 --> 00:21:24.407
these orbs detach from the main object

490
00:21:24.407 --> 00:21:27.621
to go out into the environment and then re-dock with it,

491
00:21:27.621 --> 00:21:30.361
which is interesting because if you do go back

492
00:21:30.361 --> 00:21:34.029
to my '95 photos, and I did find additional photos,

493
00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.199
you will see from the first to the last photo

494
00:21:38.199 --> 00:21:41.839
that the same exact phenomena is in the same exact location

495
00:21:41.839 --> 00:21:44.799
in the distance in those pictures as well,

496
00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:47.539
disappearing, as closed orbs were disappearing,

497
00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:50.799
so these phenomena have been around for a while

498
00:21:50.799 --> 00:21:53.359
and another serendipitous situation

499
00:21:53.359 --> 00:21:55.999
is six months before the mass sighting,

500
00:21:55.999 --> 00:21:57.239
I was invited to present

501
00:21:57.239 --> 00:22:00.359
my substance abuse prevention education program

502
00:22:00.359 --> 00:22:02.937
at the Gila River Indian Reservation School,

503
00:22:02.937 --> 00:22:04.377
they have one school there,

504
00:22:04.377 --> 00:22:07.157
and they really don't talk to outsiders much

505
00:22:07.157 --> 00:22:10.775
but I did befriend some of the teachers and the principal,

506
00:22:10.775 --> 00:22:12.255
and after the mass sighting,

507
00:22:12.255 --> 00:22:14.691
because my pictures seemed to indicate

508
00:22:14.691 --> 00:22:17.869
between the '95 pictures and the pictures I took two months

509
00:22:17.869 --> 00:22:20.067
before the mass sighting and during the mass sighting,

510
00:22:20.067 --> 00:22:22.745
that these phenomena are appearing near

511
00:22:22.745 --> 00:22:24.505
where South Mountain

512
00:22:24.505 --> 00:22:27.365
and the Estrella Mountain range intersect,

513
00:22:27.365 --> 00:22:29.115
and that's the base and in between

514
00:22:29.115 --> 00:22:32.041
is where the Gila River Indian Reservation is,

515
00:22:32.041 --> 00:22:34.321
so I called them up and I said, "Did you,

516
00:22:34.321 --> 00:22:37.589
"by chance, see any strange lights on March 13th?"

517
00:22:38.719 --> 00:22:41.219
and they started to giggle, and I said, "Is that funny?"

518
00:22:41.219 --> 00:22:42.237
and they said, "Are you kidding?

519
00:22:42.237 --> 00:22:43.773
"We've been looking up at them for centuries.

520
00:22:43.773 --> 00:22:45.311
"We call them Sky People."

521
00:22:45.311 --> 00:22:47.029
Light beings, it's part of their culture.

522
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.927
I had no idea.

523
00:22:47.927 --> 00:22:48.305
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

524
00:22:48.305 --> 00:22:49.263
<v ->That blew me away.</v>

525
00:22:49.263 --> 00:22:52.323
I mean, not only indigenous peoples here,

526
00:22:52.323 --> 00:22:55.581
but worldwide, believed that there are other intelligences

527
00:22:55.581 --> 00:22:57.169
and these orbs are spirit world.

528
00:22:57.169 --> 00:22:58.687
<v Voiceover>It's found in their ancient cave art.</v>

529
00:22:58.687 --> 00:23:00.247
<v ->Absolutely, absolutely,</v>

530
00:23:00.247 --> 00:23:02.528
and the orbs are our spirit world,

531
00:23:02.528 --> 00:23:04.547
many of them believe, coming to give them guidance

532
00:23:04.547 --> 00:23:09.012
and inspiration and comfort.

533
00:23:09.564 --> 00:23:11.203
So that was really, really interesting

534
00:23:11.203 --> 00:23:12.020
when I heard--

535
00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.599
<v Voiceover>'Cause you didn't know that at the time,</v>

536
00:23:13.599 --> 00:23:15.456
so you were a virgin to all of this.

537
00:23:15.456 --> 00:23:18.375
<v ->I have, knew nothing about these these phenomena</v>

538
00:23:18.375 --> 00:23:22.675
so the more I started to investigate, actually,

539
00:23:22.675 --> 00:23:24.145
after the mass sighting,

540
00:23:25.454 --> 00:23:28.955
because I happened to walk in the next morning

541
00:23:28.955 --> 00:23:32.195
to the MUFON investigator's home,

542
00:23:32.195 --> 00:23:34.972
with video in hand from the night before.

543
00:23:34.972 --> 00:23:37.171
I had no idea that this was happening statewide.

544
00:23:37.171 --> 00:23:40.732
To me, it was just very similar to what I had seen

545
00:23:40.732 --> 00:23:43.111
in January,

546
00:23:43.111 --> 00:23:44.300
and the first thing he says to me is

547
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.903
"Did you see the mass sighting last night?"

548
00:23:45.903 --> 00:23:47.942
and I said, "Well, I saw something similar

549
00:23:47.942 --> 00:23:49.477
"til a couple months ago."

550
00:23:49.477 --> 00:23:50.755
He said, "No, no, no, you don't understand.

551
00:23:50.755 --> 00:23:52.513
"Hundreds, if not thousands, of people,

552
00:23:52.513 --> 00:23:56.470
"saw these massive arrays of lights, V-shaped lights,

553
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:58.669
"over a mile to two miles wide,"

554
00:23:58.669 --> 00:24:02.147
in some reports, by the way, or craft,

555
00:24:02.147 --> 00:24:05.686
and NBC was coming to interview him in a half an hour.

556
00:24:05.686 --> 00:24:07.543
I said, "Whoa, I'm outta here."

557
00:24:07.543 --> 00:24:10.341
I said, first of all, I don't know what we're dealing with,

558
00:24:10.341 --> 00:24:13.481
whether it's military or a hoax or whatever,

559
00:24:13.481 --> 00:24:16.520
and I did health reporting for NBC

560
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.657
here in the early 80s and I said they might recognize me.

561
00:24:19.657 --> 00:24:20.454
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

562
00:24:20.454 --> 00:24:22.454
<v ->I'm outta here, but this isn't about me.</v>

563
00:24:22.454 --> 00:24:26.015
This is about the data so please take a copy of the footage

564
00:24:26.015 --> 00:24:29.735
from last night and share it with whoever you would like

565
00:24:29.735 --> 00:24:32.154
and I'm happy to talk with them over the phone,

566
00:24:32.154 --> 00:24:33.551
which I did, the rest of the day,

567
00:24:33.551 --> 00:24:37.512
I was getting calls all day and by 4:30 in the afternoon,

568
00:24:37.512 --> 00:24:40.031
my video was plastered on every news station.

569
00:24:40.031 --> 00:24:42.051
It was unbelievable, it was really exciting

570
00:24:42.051 --> 00:24:43.810
because here I had been documenting these things

571
00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:46.567
for so long, and now thousands of people

572
00:24:46.567 --> 00:24:47.843
had seen what I had seen.

573
00:24:47.843 --> 00:24:50.781
By 9 o'clock that night, there were a couple other videos

574
00:24:50.781 --> 00:24:53.201
that came out that were even more spectacular than mine.

575
00:24:53.201 --> 00:24:57.599
One is in a V-shape like an arrowhead with five lights

576
00:24:57.599 --> 00:25:01.311
that was taken a little before my video was taken,

577
00:25:01.311 --> 00:25:04.011
before 10 o'clock, and...

578
00:25:04.011 --> 00:25:07.189
It is spectacular, you know, you just look at the data.

579
00:25:07.189 --> 00:25:09.889
Those lights are attached to something,

580
00:25:09.889 --> 00:25:12.069
and then, after 10 o'clock,

581
00:25:12.069 --> 00:25:15.869
there were a couple videos of boomerang-shaped objects,

582
00:25:15.869 --> 00:25:17.249
huge boomerangs,

583
00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:20.969
and I thought, "Whoa, now thousands of people have seen

584
00:25:20.969 --> 00:25:23.849
"what I have seen, something's going on here."

585
00:25:23.849 --> 00:25:26.849
As not only a scientist, but as an educator,

586
00:25:26.849 --> 00:25:28.227
and certainly as an experiencer,

587
00:25:28.227 --> 00:25:30.527
I wanted to get to the bottom of it,

588
00:25:30.527 --> 00:25:32.387
and I started keeping a journal,

589
00:25:32.387 --> 00:25:35.047
a very intricate, meticulous journal

590
00:25:35.047 --> 00:25:36.967
of everything that happened

591
00:25:36.967 --> 00:25:40.307
from witness reports to media reports,

592
00:25:40.307 --> 00:25:45.165
to really going out of my way to have my data analyzed.

593
00:25:45.165 --> 00:25:48.497
I went to the University of Arizona,

594
00:25:48.497 --> 00:25:51.283
Optical Science Department, Consciousness Study Department,

595
00:25:51.283 --> 00:25:53.701
Arizona State University, Geology, Anthropology,

596
00:25:53.701 --> 00:25:55.479
Mathematics, Astronomy departments,

597
00:25:55.479 --> 00:25:57.897
as well as the Brooks Institute of Photography

598
00:25:57.897 --> 00:26:00.497
in Santa Barbara, and across the board,

599
00:26:00.497 --> 00:26:02.917
no one could give me an explanation

600
00:26:02.917 --> 00:26:04.855
for what I had documented.

601
00:26:04.855 --> 00:26:06.771
If anything, they were fascinated,

602
00:26:06.771 --> 00:26:09.771
and really, it was--

603
00:26:09.771 --> 00:26:11.429
<v Voiceover>So was that the kickoff then?</v>

604
00:26:11.429 --> 00:26:14.849
I mean, you devoted years looking into the phenomena

605
00:26:14.849 --> 00:26:16.729
after that, and of course, you've written a book,

606
00:26:16.729 --> 00:26:18.467
you did a wonderful documentary, and--

607
00:26:18.467 --> 00:26:19.275
<v ->Well, what happened</v>

608
00:26:19.275 --> 00:26:21.613
was that I pushed my entire professional life aside

609
00:26:21.613 --> 00:26:25.031
for four years, searching for a logical source

610
00:26:25.031 --> 00:26:26.729
and meaning for what I had witnessed and photographed.

611
00:26:26.729 --> 00:26:28.889
I have yet to find anything.

612
00:26:28.889 --> 00:26:31.689
My meticulous inquiry really opened up a whole new world

613
00:26:31.689 --> 00:26:33.649
to me that I had no idea existed

614
00:26:33.649 --> 00:26:36.909
from the history of these phenomena,

615
00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:39.269
from the cave drawings

616
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:43.869
and primitive prehistory caves of these objects.

617
00:26:43.869 --> 00:26:46.003
How did people know in those days

618
00:26:46.003 --> 00:26:49.505
what they would look like, that look like objects now?

619
00:26:49.505 --> 00:26:51.945
As well as the 15th and 16th century,

620
00:26:51.945 --> 00:26:53.641
with frescoes and so forth,

621
00:26:53.641 --> 00:26:55.449
and have people actually looking up at the sky.

622
00:26:55.449 --> 00:26:57.149
<v Voiceover>Yeah, Renaissance UFOs, yeah.</v>

623
00:26:57.149 --> 00:26:58.587
<v ->Exactly.</v>

624
00:26:58.587 --> 00:27:02.145
To even the World War II to the Foo Fighters,

625
00:27:02.145 --> 00:27:04.279
which are identical, identical.

626
00:27:04.279 --> 00:27:06.839
I've conversed with Dr. Richard Haines,

627
00:27:06.839 --> 00:27:08.680
who has studied quite extensively,

628
00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:13.499
pilot sightings and these orbs that were seen

629
00:27:13.499 --> 00:27:17.619
during World War II flying around the different aircraft

630
00:27:17.619 --> 00:27:20.479
in twos or threes, just like what my husband and I saw,

631
00:27:20.479 --> 00:27:22.257
and each side thought the other side had

632
00:27:22.257 --> 00:27:24.177
this advanced spy technology,

633
00:27:24.177 --> 00:27:26.497
and it wasn't until after World War II

634
00:27:26.497 --> 00:27:29.137
that everyone found out no one has this spy technology.

635
00:27:29.137 --> 00:27:29.627
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

636
00:27:29.627 --> 00:27:31.665
<v ->Not only that, these orbs have certainly been seen</v>

637
00:27:31.665 --> 00:27:33.183
above nuclear bases.

638
00:27:33.183 --> 00:27:34.661
There's a wonderful story--

639
00:27:34.661 --> 00:27:36.279
<v Voiceover>That's a common thing, is they show up</v>

640
00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:39.257
around nuclear facilities globally, yes,

641
00:27:39.257 --> 00:27:40.816
and that has been going on for decades.

642
00:27:40.816 --> 00:27:45.694
<v ->And I have to say because from my own view,</v>

643
00:27:45.694 --> 00:27:48.504
and I'm not saying everything's benevolent by any means,

644
00:27:48.504 --> 00:27:51.904
but not only from what happened here in Arizona,

645
00:27:51.904 --> 00:27:55.104
which was a very gentle non-threatening visit,

646
00:27:55.104 --> 00:27:57.464
but when you look at the data

647
00:27:57.464 --> 00:27:59.204
and see what has happened worldwide

648
00:27:59.204 --> 00:28:01.505
for many decades with these orbs,

649
00:28:01.505 --> 00:28:04.624
and that they're flying around nuclear bases,

650
00:28:04.624 --> 00:28:07.254
or nuclear silos, and the destruction

651
00:28:07.254 --> 00:28:08.874
that could have occurred.

652
00:28:08.874 --> 00:28:10.409
Certainly, their advanced technology--

653
00:28:10.409 --> 00:28:11.944
<v Voiceover>And there are times they did interface,</v>

654
00:28:11.944 --> 00:28:14.219
where they would actually shut down the silos and--

655
00:28:14.219 --> 00:28:16.374
<v ->That happened in Montana in the 1960,</v>

656
00:28:16.374 --> 00:28:20.574
actually it was in March 16th, 1967,

657
00:28:20.574 --> 00:28:23.805
and our mass, 30 years, March 13th, 1997.

658
00:28:23.805 --> 00:28:25.179
<v Voiceover>And they did, and that was taken,</v>

659
00:28:25.179 --> 00:28:26.976
I mean, they certainly took exception.

660
00:28:26.976 --> 00:28:28.530
The military took exception to that,

661
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:31.106
thinking something else from the outside could interfere

662
00:28:31.106 --> 00:28:33.845
and immediately interpreted that as a threat,

663
00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:35.640
of course, which we have to build up against,

664
00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.580
but what you say is more fundamentally true.

665
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.676
This has been happening for, well, forever actually,

666
00:28:41.676 --> 00:28:42.106
thousands of years--

667
00:28:42.106 --> 00:28:43.837
<v ->Everybody comes from a different background,</v>

668
00:28:43.837 --> 00:28:46.717
from a different upbringing, from a different belief system,

669
00:28:46.717 --> 00:28:50.117
and it's going to take some people longer than others

670
00:28:50.117 --> 00:28:52.507
for this to sink in, and in fact, there's many people

671
00:28:52.507 --> 00:28:54.242
that can't deal with it or don't want to deal with it

672
00:28:54.242 --> 00:28:55.362
and that's OK.

673
00:28:55.362 --> 00:28:57.542
That's OK, everyone in their own time,

674
00:28:57.542 --> 00:29:00.418
but the data is there if they want to look at it.

675
00:29:00.418 --> 00:29:01.576
<v Voiceover>The data's absolutely there,</v>

676
00:29:01.576 --> 00:29:03.592
and but what did it do to you and your life?

677
00:29:03.592 --> 00:29:04.850
I mean you have something coming up

678
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:07.188
that I think is very exciting

679
00:29:07.188 --> 00:29:09.506
because understanding who we are,

680
00:29:09.506 --> 00:29:11.104
who our neighbors in the cosmos are,

681
00:29:11.104 --> 00:29:13.604
what these phenomena are should be a part

682
00:29:13.604 --> 00:29:15.564
of our education.

683
00:29:15.564 --> 00:29:17.924
It should be passed on through families,

684
00:29:17.924 --> 00:29:20.384
through schools, and so forth,

685
00:29:20.384 --> 00:29:23.944
and let's talk about, after that time leading up

686
00:29:23.944 --> 00:29:26.464
to what you're getting ready to do right now,

687
00:29:26.464 --> 00:29:28.584
how you took it on personally

688
00:29:28.584 --> 00:29:31.380
and how you interpreted this and what you feel

689
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.398
should be shared and how.

690
00:29:33.398 --> 00:29:37.458
<v ->Well not only was it bizarre that after the mass sighting,</v>

691
00:29:37.458 --> 00:29:40.786
there was no investigation, there was no explanation.

692
00:29:41.668 --> 00:29:45.134
The elected officials, for the most part,

693
00:29:45.134 --> 00:29:48.234
said, "What? Something happened on March 13?"

694
00:29:48.234 --> 00:29:52.334
and it was just very frustrating for the witnesses

695
00:29:52.334 --> 00:29:55.654
that had had this massive craft, this massive phenomena

696
00:29:55.654 --> 00:29:58.634
right over their heads, looked into these,

697
00:29:58.634 --> 00:30:01.294
what they would call canisters of light,

698
00:30:01.294 --> 00:30:03.452
and some people said that they, it was,

699
00:30:03.452 --> 00:30:06.152
they could throw a stone at it, it was that close.

700
00:30:06.152 --> 00:30:08.832
Silent, just gliding,

701
00:30:08.832 --> 00:30:11.070
and some people did see it take off at a tremendous speed,

702
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.048
I have to add that.

703
00:30:13.048 --> 00:30:15.626
Incredible technology, to be sure, there was not a sound,

704
00:30:15.626 --> 00:30:19.946
and even when the object took off at a miraculous speed,

705
00:30:19.946 --> 00:30:20.984
there was no sonic boom.

706
00:30:20.984 --> 00:30:22.702
I mean we're talking incredible technology here.

707
00:30:22.702 --> 00:30:24.772
<v Voiceover>An official silence.</v>

708
00:30:24.772 --> 00:30:25.558
<v ->Official silence</v>

709
00:30:25.558 --> 00:30:26.132
until--
<v Voiceover>The government</v>

710
00:30:26.132 --> 00:30:26.934
<v Voiceover>did come out. (laughs)</v>

711
00:30:26.934 --> 00:30:29.190
<v ->Until, no, we're getting ahead of ourselves,</v>

712
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:33.548
until there was a big article,

713
00:30:33.548 --> 00:30:34.648
front page article

714
00:30:34.648 --> 00:30:38.306
in USA Today, June 18th, 1997,

715
00:30:38.306 --> 00:30:39.646
months later,

716
00:30:39.646 --> 00:30:42.064
opening up the sighting to international scrutiny.

717
00:30:42.064 --> 00:30:45.564
We were deluged by media from all over the world,

718
00:30:45.564 --> 00:30:48.784
and once they started talking to the witnesses as I had,

719
00:30:48.784 --> 00:30:51.944
their stories were so detailed and so heartfelt,

720
00:30:51.944 --> 00:30:55.384
something really special, extraordinary happened here,

721
00:30:55.384 --> 00:30:57.842
they too were saying, "Why isn't there an investigation?

722
00:30:57.842 --> 00:31:00.002
"Why isn't there an explanation?"

723
00:31:00.002 --> 00:31:03.561
and very interestingly, the next day,

724
00:31:03.561 --> 00:31:05.161
June 19th,

725
00:31:05.161 --> 00:31:06.981
the former governor, Fife Symington,

726
00:31:06.981 --> 00:31:08.681
called a press conference,

727
00:31:08.681 --> 00:31:10.782
saying that they had found the culprit,

728
00:31:10.782 --> 00:31:13.481
and everybody took it quite seriously,

729
00:31:13.481 --> 00:31:17.061
and here he marches out one of his aides

730
00:31:17.061 --> 00:31:21.279
in a big alien head costume and really mocked the sighting.

731
00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:21.977
<v Voiceover>I remember that.</v>

732
00:31:21.977 --> 00:31:24.717
<v ->And offended many people, I have to say,</v>

733
00:31:24.717 --> 00:31:27.975
especially many people with their children,

734
00:31:27.975 --> 00:31:30.135
either playing baseball or going to the mall,

735
00:31:30.135 --> 00:31:33.793
and they knew what they saw

736
00:31:33.793 --> 00:31:35.307
was real,

737
00:31:35.307 --> 00:31:38.765
and here they were blowing it off and making a joke of it.

738
00:31:38.765 --> 00:31:40.585
A few weeks later,

739
00:31:40.585 --> 00:31:43.865
actually, July 24th,

740
00:31:43.865 --> 00:31:46.603
and I had really tried to do my homework across the board,

741
00:31:46.603 --> 00:31:48.823
not only with my own data,

742
00:31:48.823 --> 00:31:52.464
but also calling every military base,

743
00:31:52.464 --> 00:31:56.503
and I do have some of those comical conversations in my book

744
00:31:56.503 --> 00:31:59.463
because they were just as curious.

745
00:31:59.463 --> 00:32:02.603
Some of them were embarrassed

746
00:32:02.603 --> 00:32:04.403
that they didn't know what it was,

747
00:32:04.403 --> 00:32:08.761
and suddenly, I get a call from the head

748
00:32:08.761 --> 00:32:12.919
of the PR at the Air National Guard, and she says,

749
00:32:12.919 --> 00:32:14.636
"Dr. Lynne, I think we know what those lights were

750
00:32:14.636 --> 00:32:15.994
"back in March," and I was thrilled.

751
00:32:15.994 --> 00:32:18.134
I thought, "Great, finally I'm gonna find out

752
00:32:18.134 --> 00:32:20.534
"what they were," and she says, "Do you believe

753
00:32:20.534 --> 00:32:22.154
"that nobody ever looked at the log

754
00:32:22.154 --> 00:32:23.692
"for visiting Air National Guard

755
00:32:23.692 --> 00:32:25.550
"and Maryland Air National Guard was in town

756
00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:28.450
"sending off flares, so that must be

757
00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:32.488
"what some people saw in Operation Snowbird,"

758
00:32:32.488 --> 00:32:34.776
and I said, "Well, wait a minute, first of all,

759
00:32:36.998 --> 00:32:41.622
"you're trying to tell me that what we saw were flares."

760
00:32:41.622 --> 00:32:44.097
I said, "You know, when were they in town?"

761
00:32:44.097 --> 00:32:46.554
and she said from March 1st to March 15th,

762
00:32:46.554 --> 00:32:48.352
I said, "Were they in town in January?"

763
00:32:48.352 --> 00:32:51.131
She says, "Oh no, definitely not."

764
00:32:51.131 --> 00:32:54.931
I said, "Well, I have 35 millimeter photographs

765
00:32:54.931 --> 00:32:56.471
"of the same exact exact phenomena

766
00:32:56.471 --> 00:32:59.411
"in the same exact location, in class B airspace,

767
00:32:59.411 --> 00:33:00.609
"two months before the mass sighting."

768
00:33:00.609 --> 00:33:02.849
She said, "You never told me that,"

769
00:33:02.849 --> 00:33:04.829
and then I said, "Besides that,"

770
00:33:04.829 --> 00:33:06.607
I said, "You're trying to say that flares,"

771
00:33:06.607 --> 00:33:08.827
that I, by then I had educated myself

772
00:33:08.827 --> 00:33:10.385
to any logical explanation,

773
00:33:10.385 --> 00:33:13.123
and flares drift and drop with the wind haphazardly.

774
00:33:13.123 --> 00:33:15.543
They have huge smoke trails that are illuminated

775
00:33:15.543 --> 00:33:17.661
by the flare itself, it's an illumination flare

776
00:33:17.661 --> 00:33:20.459
that they were saying they deployed,

777
00:33:20.459 --> 00:33:21.957
well, to best illuminate,

778
00:33:21.957 --> 00:33:26.537
nobody, no one, described the phenomena like that,

779
00:33:27.047 --> 00:33:28.445
and I said, "And you're trying to tell me

780
00:33:28.445 --> 00:33:32.003
"that flares that cannot keep a formation,

781
00:33:32.003 --> 00:33:36.043
"traversed the entire state for hours in a V array?"

782
00:33:36.043 --> 00:33:37.641
and she says, "Oh, oh, I have a call coming in,

783
00:33:37.641 --> 00:33:38.539
"I'll get back to you."

784
00:33:38.539 --> 00:33:41.497
Well I'm still waiting, it's 14 years. (laughs)

785
00:33:41.497 --> 00:33:45.235
So at that point, it really started to sink in

786
00:33:45.235 --> 00:33:47.655
that whoa, you know, something's going on here,

787
00:33:47.655 --> 00:33:50.385
and from that day on,

788
00:33:50.385 --> 00:33:52.131
not only did they push the flare theory

789
00:33:52.131 --> 00:33:53.409
and they've never,

790
00:33:53.409 --> 00:33:57.469
ever addressed the craft phenomena,

791
00:33:57.469 --> 00:34:00.829
but many people were asking for a reenactment.

792
00:34:00.829 --> 00:34:02.529
OK, and I was open.

793
00:34:02.529 --> 00:34:04.890
Fine, if it's military, and I knew I had pictures

794
00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:07.809
from '95 that had the same phenomena,

795
00:34:07.809 --> 00:34:11.367
from '97 that was confirmed by your traffic controllers

796
00:34:11.367 --> 00:34:15.715
in class B restricted airspace, and the same location

797
00:34:16.587 --> 00:34:18.385
during the mass sighting as well.

798
00:34:18.385 --> 00:34:21.425
So whoever did this, did it at least three times,

799
00:34:21.425 --> 00:34:22.802
do it again.

800
00:34:22.802 --> 00:34:25.682
Well, we waited and we waited, and finally,

801
00:34:25.682 --> 00:34:28.520
right before the third anniversary,

802
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.138
there was a big announcement that three Air National Guards

803
00:34:31.138 --> 00:34:34.878
were coming into town, California, New York and Michigan,

804
00:34:34.878 --> 00:34:38.118
I believe, to hold deployment

805
00:34:38.118 --> 00:34:39.774
to show everyone the Phoenix Lights.

806
00:34:39.774 --> 00:34:41.235
They were flares.

807
00:34:41.235 --> 00:34:42.652
Great, OK.

808
00:34:42.652 --> 00:34:45.391
Well, everyone was ready for them, including the media,

809
00:34:45.391 --> 00:34:48.610
and I have to say again, the data speaks for itself,

810
00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:50.310
all you have to do is look at it.

811
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:51.046
<v Voiceover>Wasn't the same experience.</v>

812
00:34:51.046 --> 00:34:52.260
<v ->Significantly different.</v>

813
00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:52.668
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

814
00:34:52.668 --> 00:34:54.014
<v ->From the real deal,</v>

815
00:34:54.014 --> 00:34:57.454
and that really convinced me more than anything

816
00:34:57.454 --> 00:34:59.554
that hey, the military had their shot.

817
00:34:59.554 --> 00:35:01.054
This was the only explanation

818
00:35:01.054 --> 00:35:03.332
that they ever came up with, OK?

819
00:35:03.332 --> 00:35:06.132
And I know what I saw up close and personal

820
00:35:06.132 --> 00:35:07.590
was definitely not flares.

821
00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:10.508
In fact, the point that we lived kind of nestled

822
00:35:10.508 --> 00:35:12.988
in the mountain range and it was so close

823
00:35:12.988 --> 00:35:16.786
over a treacherous gated community,

824
00:35:16.786 --> 00:35:18.724
there's no way it was military,

825
00:35:18.724 --> 00:35:21.104
so, and with all the other data,

826
00:35:21.104 --> 00:35:23.712
it just points to something unknown.

827
00:35:24.202 --> 00:35:26.082
<v Voiceover>So you went on your journey,</v>

828
00:35:26.082 --> 00:35:29.080
put everything aside and you studied, studied, studied,

829
00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.820
and you've produced these beautiful works,

830
00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:34.560
and I wanna know, for you personally,

831
00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:35.840
what you've come to with it.

832
00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.720
<v ->Well, what happened was that after the four years,</v>

833
00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.598
I ended up with a 750-page journal of incredible data,

834
00:35:42.598 --> 00:35:44.898
not only the history, but similar sightings

835
00:35:44.898 --> 00:35:47.738
that have happened worldwide for many decades.

836
00:35:47.738 --> 00:35:50.336
I mean we're talking Lubbock Lights and

837
00:35:50.336 --> 00:35:53.754
the Hudson Valley sightings, and Belgium,

838
00:35:53.754 --> 00:35:57.214
which was an amazing set of circumstances

839
00:35:57.214 --> 00:36:00.114
because they actually joined forces with

840
00:36:00.114 --> 00:36:02.954
the community and university and military,

841
00:36:02.954 --> 00:36:05.914
which is a stunning example of what should happen.

842
00:36:05.914 --> 00:36:06.686
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

843
00:36:06.686 --> 00:36:08.686
<v ->As well as UK and Russia.</v>

844
00:36:08.686 --> 00:36:12.326
In fact, one month, one month before the mass sighting

845
00:36:12.326 --> 00:36:15.766
on February 19th, 1997, there was a mass sighting

846
00:36:15.766 --> 00:36:18.466
in St. Petersburg, Russia, and a couple people

847
00:36:18.466 --> 00:36:22.262
actually got video, which is stunning

848
00:36:22.262 --> 00:36:24.223
in the first place, and in the second place,

849
00:36:24.223 --> 00:36:27.542
it's very similar to one of the craft that people saw here,

850
00:36:27.542 --> 00:36:32.182
that we now have gracing the cover of our new DVD,

851
00:36:32.182 --> 00:36:35.152
The Phoenix Lights: Beyond Top Secret.

852
00:36:35.152 --> 00:36:38.192
What happened at that point is that I did go back to work

853
00:36:38.192 --> 00:36:41.048
to help put our younger son through medical school,

854
00:36:41.048 --> 00:36:42.986
and as a chief clinical consultant

855
00:36:42.986 --> 00:36:45.426
at the Arizona Heart Institute Wellness and Imaging Center,

856
00:36:45.426 --> 00:36:49.784
while I pared down the best of what I found,

857
00:36:49.784 --> 00:36:52.564
and I was anonymous for seven years and I still,

858
00:36:52.564 --> 00:36:54.002
at the point, didn't know if I wanted

859
00:36:54.002 --> 00:36:56.562
to come forward with the data,

860
00:36:56.562 --> 00:37:00.082
but it was so overwhelming, and I continued

861
00:37:00.082 --> 00:37:02.942
to take photographs of these phenomena

862
00:37:02.942 --> 00:37:05.960
that in good conscience, as an educator,

863
00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.218
and I've been educating the community for over 30 years

864
00:37:08.218 --> 00:37:09.896
on the reality of vital health issues,

865
00:37:09.896 --> 00:37:11.294
I have a company that produces video

866
00:37:11.294 --> 00:37:13.852
and workbook curriculums on AIDS and teen pregnancy

867
00:37:13.852 --> 00:37:17.670
and substance abuse, to help wake up youth,

868
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:21.530
particularly, to the reality of different health issues,

869
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:24.668
how could I not, as an educator,

870
00:37:24.668 --> 00:37:27.349
share the reality of this vital issue,

871
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:30.676
and I finally decided to come forward,

872
00:37:30.676 --> 00:37:32.940
pared down the book to 230 pages

873
00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.478
of the best information that I had

874
00:37:35.478 --> 00:37:36.190
gathered.
<v Voiceover>And you've done</v>

875
00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:37.084
<v Voiceover>a wonderful job.</v>

876
00:37:37.084 --> 00:37:38.462
<v ->Thank you, thank you very much.</v>

877
00:37:38.462 --> 00:37:41.610
It was a rough, rough few years because

878
00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.818
I really didn't know if I should come forward.

879
00:37:44.818 --> 00:37:48.018
I mean it's such a precarious topic and controversial,

880
00:37:48.018 --> 00:37:50.316
but you know what, it is what it is.

881
00:37:50.316 --> 00:37:51.514
I'm just sharing the data

882
00:37:51.514 --> 00:37:52.992
and people can make up their own minds.

883
00:37:52.992 --> 00:37:55.831
I'm not saying, what I have never said, what it is.

884
00:37:55.831 --> 00:37:58.631
I don't know what it is, but I know that it is,

885
00:37:58.631 --> 00:38:00.729
and it's time we get this out in the open

886
00:38:00.729 --> 00:38:04.029
and address it, accept it, and study it,

887
00:38:04.029 --> 00:38:05.427
so we can move forward.

888
00:38:05.427 --> 00:38:07.527
<v Voiceover>So you're literally looking to take it</v>

889
00:38:07.527 --> 00:38:08.927
to the classroom.

890
00:38:08.927 --> 00:38:10.746
<v ->Well, what happened was that after I came out</v>

891
00:38:10.746 --> 00:38:13.305
with the book, I was invited,

892
00:38:13.305 --> 00:38:15.081
after Barnes &amp; Nobles and Borders told

893
00:38:15.081 --> 00:38:19.099
to actually present the case

894
00:38:19.099 --> 00:38:20.939
at a local school here,

895
00:38:20.939 --> 00:38:23.319
which was amazing in and of itself.

896
00:38:23.319 --> 00:38:24.998
The parents had gotten out together

897
00:38:24.998 --> 00:38:26.672
and I was so honored

898
00:38:26.672 --> 00:38:30.472
to walk into 200 middle school students

899
00:38:30.472 --> 00:38:32.352
that were sitting on the edge of their chairs.

900
00:38:32.352 --> 00:38:34.067
They thirst for this.

901
00:38:34.067 --> 00:38:34.803
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

902
00:38:34.803 --> 00:38:35.978
<v ->They thirst for this knowledge.</v>

903
00:38:35.978 --> 00:38:37.833
There is nothing, and that's when I realized

904
00:38:37.833 --> 00:38:39.048
that I really had to do something.

905
00:38:39.048 --> 00:38:41.084
<v Voiceover>The could've been doing algebra. (laughs)</v>

906
00:38:41.084 --> 00:38:43.123
<v ->Well it was the last period of the day,</v>

907
00:38:43.123 --> 00:38:45.353
and the teachers were amazed, too,

908
00:38:45.353 --> 00:38:46.953
that you could hear a pin drop,

909
00:38:46.953 --> 00:38:49.863
and I realized that, jeez, I mean I really needed

910
00:38:49.863 --> 00:38:51.598
to get something out there visually,

911
00:38:51.598 --> 00:38:53.494
and that's when I decided to do the documentary.

912
00:38:53.494 --> 00:38:56.028
After I came out with the book in 2004,

913
00:38:56.028 --> 00:38:57.968
I was approached by several filmmakers,

914
00:38:57.968 --> 00:38:59.063
but I didn't have any time.

915
00:38:59.063 --> 00:39:02.158
I was working 7 to 7 and radio programs into the night

916
00:39:02.158 --> 00:39:05.838
and Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble tour on the weekends,

917
00:39:05.838 --> 00:39:09.738
but after I saw those kids and realized that, whoa,

918
00:39:09.738 --> 00:39:11.458
I mean there is nothing,

919
00:39:11.458 --> 00:39:15.088
nothing in our history books about this topic,

920
00:39:15.088 --> 00:39:16.604
I had to get something out there visually

921
00:39:16.604 --> 00:39:19.378
and that's when I started doing the documentary

922
00:39:19.378 --> 00:39:21.713
and by the summer, it became quite apparent

923
00:39:21.713 --> 00:39:23.613
that I had to make a decision.

924
00:39:23.613 --> 00:39:26.688
I couldn't do everything and

925
00:39:26.688 --> 00:39:31.228
I was well on the way to producing the documentary

926
00:39:31.228 --> 00:39:34.948
and getting incredible interviews from military and pilots

927
00:39:34.948 --> 00:39:37.583
and witnesses and so forth,

928
00:39:37.583 --> 00:39:40.718
that I decided to leave the Arizona Heart Institute

929
00:39:40.718 --> 00:39:42.854
and to take this road,

930
00:39:42.854 --> 00:39:44.008
and finish the documentary.

931
00:39:44.008 --> 00:39:46.373
We've won over a dozen international film festival awards.

932
00:39:46.373 --> 00:39:48.368
We're really proud but the main thing is,

933
00:39:48.368 --> 00:39:52.008
and the book and documentary really complement each other,

934
00:39:52.008 --> 00:39:56.749
is now, I really feel, is imperative

935
00:39:56.749 --> 00:39:58.808
to get something into the classroom,

936
00:39:58.808 --> 00:40:01.883
and I'm working with some wonderful educators, the--

937
00:40:01.883 --> 00:40:03.573
<v Voiceover>Hear, hear, this will be the first, too.</v>

938
00:40:03.573 --> 00:40:04.988
<v ->Oh yes, oh yes.</v>

939
00:40:04.988 --> 00:40:06.963
<v Voiceover>This I'm excited about, this is fabulous.</v>

940
00:40:06.963 --> 00:40:08.839
<v ->Yes, my other programs are being distributed</v>

941
00:40:08.839 --> 00:40:11.859
by Discovery Education and

942
00:40:11.859 --> 00:40:15.894
hopefully, this will also open the door

943
00:40:15.894 --> 00:40:19.409
in public schools, and already, in charter schools,

944
00:40:19.409 --> 00:40:22.749
they're already showing my documentary, reading my book,

945
00:40:22.749 --> 00:40:24.204
which is thrilling to me.

946
00:40:24.204 --> 00:40:26.309
I mean this is what I'm about, that's my passion.

947
00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:28.544
<v Voiceover>That's your, that's the piece of the pie</v>

948
00:40:28.544 --> 00:40:31.319
that you carry, is that you were given the heads up,

949
00:40:31.319 --> 00:40:33.279
for reasons you may never know,

950
00:40:33.279 --> 00:40:36.919
to be ready and standing by with your camera charged

951
00:40:36.919 --> 00:40:39.419
and ready for the phenomena when it showed,

952
00:40:39.419 --> 00:40:41.319
documenting it all the way through,

953
00:40:41.319 --> 00:40:44.959
having the fortitude, the discipline and the intelligence

954
00:40:44.959 --> 00:40:47.659
to be able to pull it together in terms of your book,

955
00:40:47.659 --> 00:40:50.199
your documentary, and do exactly what you're doing now,

956
00:40:50.199 --> 00:40:52.315
which is, no one has succeeded in doing that,

957
00:40:52.315 --> 00:40:56.080
probably, very few, if anyone has even tried.

958
00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.670
That's a testament to your own strength and will

959
00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:02.685
and energy to follow this all the way through

960
00:41:02.685 --> 00:41:04.605
because we can't relegate this

961
00:41:04.605 --> 00:41:07.145
to a giggle factor any longer.

962
00:41:07.145 --> 00:41:09.300
<v ->Well that was one of the reasons that I came forward.</v>

963
00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.600
I mean there were a few reasons that I came forward,

964
00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:15.485
one of which, our younger son who is now a neurologist,

965
00:41:16.315 --> 00:41:20.555
and he also had a couple sightings of the Phoenix Lights,

966
00:41:20.555 --> 00:41:23.035
was the only one that read the 750-page journal.

967
00:41:23.035 --> 00:41:25.110
He happened to be home for a couple weeks

968
00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:26.465
and he looked at me and he said,

969
00:41:26.465 --> 00:41:28.445
"Mom, you have to do this.

970
00:41:28.445 --> 00:41:30.701
"This is too important not to share,

971
00:41:30.701 --> 00:41:33.096
"and everything you've done has led up to this."

972
00:41:33.096 --> 00:41:33.631
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

973
00:41:33.631 --> 00:41:36.546
<v ->It was like, whoa, you know, from the mouth of babes.</v>

974
00:41:36.546 --> 00:41:39.541
I really, that really hit home

975
00:41:39.541 --> 00:41:42.681
because if I could lend my expertise,

976
00:41:42.681 --> 00:41:45.121
my unique expertise and credibility

977
00:41:45.121 --> 00:41:47.026
so that people actually look at the data,

978
00:41:47.026 --> 00:41:48.801
and that's why I came forward.

979
00:41:48.801 --> 00:41:50.011
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

980
00:41:50.011 --> 00:41:51.626
<v ->I knew if I didn't come forward,</v>

981
00:41:51.626 --> 00:41:53.266
it was gonna sit on a shelf.

982
00:41:53.266 --> 00:41:55.766
<v Voiceover>So what should we look for,</v>

983
00:41:55.766 --> 00:41:58.241
within the education framework of this?

984
00:41:58.241 --> 00:42:00.396
Are you dealing with schools directly

985
00:42:00.396 --> 00:42:03.072
to put it in curriculum in public, private?

986
00:42:03.072 --> 00:42:05.867
<v ->We're just at the fundamental</v>

987
00:42:05.867 --> 00:42:07.567
gathering and development right now.

988
00:42:07.567 --> 00:42:10.597
I'm working with a wonderful

989
00:42:10.597 --> 00:42:12.637
senior math professor at ASU,

990
00:42:12.637 --> 00:42:17.017
Dr. Al Swimmer, who is very into the crop circle phenomena,

991
00:42:17.017 --> 00:42:19.572
and when you really look at that data,

992
00:42:19.572 --> 00:42:22.002
it is breathtaking,

993
00:42:22.002 --> 00:42:25.303
not only in the formations themselves,

994
00:42:25.303 --> 00:42:29.083
but in the mathematical integrity

995
00:42:29.083 --> 00:42:31.617
in the crop circles themselves,

996
00:42:31.617 --> 00:42:33.977
the geometry and so forth,

997
00:42:33.977 --> 00:42:36.977
and we are actually gonna be taking

998
00:42:36.977 --> 00:42:39.518
one of the, the one,

999
00:42:39.518 --> 00:42:42.327
crop circle that he handed me of three orbs

1000
00:42:42.327 --> 00:42:45.123
that was dissected by an equilateral triangle,

1001
00:42:45.123 --> 00:42:47.344
and you would not believe how many equilateral triangles

1002
00:42:47.344 --> 00:42:48.819
are in this one crop circle,

1003
00:42:48.819 --> 00:42:52.009
it blew him away when he really started working on it,

1004
00:42:52.009 --> 00:42:55.904
so that we can introduce crop circles to youth,

1005
00:42:55.904 --> 00:42:58.599
and I'm actually working from grade school and up

1006
00:42:58.599 --> 00:43:02.299
to do this for kids at each level,

1007
00:43:02.299 --> 00:43:04.674
and certainly, we'll start out simple

1008
00:43:04.674 --> 00:43:06.010
and it'll be an overview.

1009
00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:08.250
We're not trying to convince anybody of anything,

1010
00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:10.550
it's just the data, and they can make,

1011
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:11.850
they can decide for themselves,

1012
00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:14.470
but where crop circles are concerned,

1013
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:17.310
certainly we want to introduce the phenomena itself,

1014
00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:18.930
and the history of the phenomena,

1015
00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:22.726
and what real crop circles

1016
00:43:22.726 --> 00:43:24.585
show us,

1017
00:43:24.585 --> 00:43:25.760
not only in their beauty,

1018
00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:29.256
but also in the mathematical end of things,

1019
00:43:29.256 --> 00:43:31.077
as well as history.

1020
00:43:31.077 --> 00:43:33.516
There certainly is a vast history of this phenomena,

1021
00:43:33.516 --> 00:43:36.177
again, that has never been in the history books.

1022
00:43:36.177 --> 00:43:36.768
<v Voiceover>No,</v>

1023
00:43:36.768 --> 00:43:39.228
and no doubt, I would guess this will be

1024
00:43:39.228 --> 00:43:42.423
a universal favorite course,

1025
00:43:42.423 --> 00:43:44.513
when this makes it into the system.

1026
00:43:44.513 --> 00:43:45.369
<v ->We're gonna work very hard,</v>

1027
00:43:45.369 --> 00:43:46.719
well I'm gonna work very hard--

1028
00:43:46.719 --> 00:43:48.814
<v Voiceover>And it speaks to people on a different level.</v>

1029
00:43:48.814 --> 00:43:49.230
<v ->Yes.</v>

1030
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:50.484
<v Voiceover>It's telling them something</v>

1031
00:43:50.484 --> 00:43:52.945
that they feel an inherent connection with

1032
00:43:52.945 --> 00:43:54.755
or there wouldn't be the intrigue.

1033
00:43:54.755 --> 00:43:56.891
<v ->Absolutely, but not only that,</v>

1034
00:43:56.891 --> 00:43:57.688
there's so much more.

1035
00:43:57.688 --> 00:43:58.782
I mean the science of it.

1036
00:43:58.782 --> 00:44:00.882
There are terms, there are scientific

1037
00:44:03.372 --> 00:44:06.273
data that is so fascinating

1038
00:44:06.273 --> 00:44:08.332
that quantum physics and quantum mechanics

1039
00:44:08.332 --> 00:44:10.582
is now starting to catch up with the possibility

1040
00:44:10.582 --> 00:44:11.862
of different dimensions,

1041
00:44:11.862 --> 00:44:14.343
of different times and spaces along with art,

1042
00:44:14.343 --> 00:44:16.398
and I share something in my new book

1043
00:44:16.398 --> 00:44:18.978
that I had never thought I would share before

1044
00:44:18.978 --> 00:44:22.193
concerning my '95 closed photographs

1045
00:44:22.193 --> 00:44:24.999
that was discovered by Dr. Bruce Maccabee,

1046
00:44:26.228 --> 00:44:27.924
between the first and the last picture

1047
00:44:27.924 --> 00:44:31.598
that is really photographic evidence,

1048
00:44:31.598 --> 00:44:34.053
the first authenticated photographic evidence ever

1049
00:44:34.053 --> 00:44:36.888
of missing time, and that's a whole story in itself.

1050
00:44:36.888 --> 00:44:37.763
<v Voiceover>It is, indeed.</v>

1051
00:44:37.763 --> 00:44:39.238
What's the name of that book?

1052
00:44:39.238 --> 00:44:40.134
<v ->That's in my book now.</v>

1053
00:44:40.134 --> 00:44:41.865
<v Voiceover>Oh, I thought you said a new one coming up.</v>

1054
00:44:41.865 --> 00:44:43.719
<v ->Well I actually came forward.</v>

1055
00:44:43.719 --> 00:44:45.090
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1056
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:48.006
<v ->Last year, the publisher, Hampton Roads,</v>

1057
00:44:48.006 --> 00:44:51.854
asked me to do a new book of an update since 2004,

1058
00:44:51.854 --> 00:44:56.349
and I have to say, the first book not only is so jam-packed

1059
00:44:56.349 --> 00:44:59.549
with so many important

1060
00:44:59.549 --> 00:45:02.549
events and data and information and so forth

1061
00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:05.649
that I thought it was really important for people

1062
00:45:05.649 --> 00:45:10.289
to read that and to be educated to that material,

1063
00:45:10.289 --> 00:45:12.904
so I added a section on what has happened

1064
00:45:12.904 --> 00:45:15.518
since I came forward in 2004,

1065
00:45:15.518 --> 00:45:18.179
and that is included in there as well,

1066
00:45:18.179 --> 00:45:21.178
and certainly our website, ThePhoenixLights.net.

1067
00:45:21.178 --> 00:45:25.979
ThePhoenixLights.net has the full report, 21-page report,

1068
00:45:25.979 --> 00:45:28.923
by Dr. Bruce Maccabee, which I applaud him.

1069
00:45:28.923 --> 00:45:29.923
I didn't find it.

1070
00:45:29.923 --> 00:45:31.803
If it wasn't for him, I would have not,

1071
00:45:31.803 --> 00:45:33.459
had no idea this data was here,

1072
00:45:33.459 --> 00:45:36.576
but I did keep it private for over a dozen years

1073
00:45:36.576 --> 00:45:38.515
because it was so bizarre,

1074
00:45:38.515 --> 00:45:41.115
but now I'm sharing it for the first time.

1075
00:45:41.115 --> 00:45:43.435
The other part of the curriculum

1076
00:45:43.435 --> 00:45:48.211
that is really important is not only critical thinking

1077
00:45:48.211 --> 00:45:52.711
and to get used to start really considering

1078
00:45:52.711 --> 00:45:57.106
the possibility of us not being alone in the universe,

1079
00:45:57.106 --> 00:45:58.262
of the possibility

1080
00:45:58.262 --> 00:46:02.202
that there are other intelligences

1081
00:46:02.202 --> 00:46:04.102
that are out there.

1082
00:46:04.102 --> 00:46:06.302
What if there were?

1083
00:46:06.302 --> 00:46:07.538
What would happen?

1084
00:46:07.538 --> 00:46:09.098
Get them thinking, what would happen

1085
00:46:09.098 --> 00:46:11.394
to change our life on earth,

1086
00:46:11.394 --> 00:46:14.374
and our perception and our world view,

1087
00:46:14.374 --> 00:46:16.394
as well as conflict resolution.

1088
00:46:16.394 --> 00:46:19.580
If we can't really

1089
00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:23.530
end our conflicts between ourselves,

1090
00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:26.810
how are we going to have a peaceful relationship

1091
00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:27.906
to other intelligences,

1092
00:46:27.906 --> 00:46:30.046
so that's gonna be all part of this as well,

1093
00:46:30.046 --> 00:46:34.086
so we're trying to do a whole overview of the topic,

1094
00:46:34.086 --> 00:46:37.626
as well as to really just get kids

1095
00:46:37.626 --> 00:46:39.602
to start thinking about this, and young people

1096
00:46:39.602 --> 00:46:42.262
to really start considering the possibilities,

1097
00:46:42.262 --> 00:46:45.382
so that they, if they're curious and if they wish to,

1098
00:46:45.382 --> 00:46:47.962
can look further because there's a plethora,

1099
00:46:47.962 --> 00:46:51.282
a plethora of information out there once you start looking,

1100
00:46:51.282 --> 00:46:52.778
and that's credible.

1101
00:46:52.778 --> 00:46:54.838
Certainly, there's lots out there that's not,

1102
00:46:54.838 --> 00:46:58.538
but there is an abundance and more and more,

1103
00:46:58.538 --> 00:46:59.994
and now certainly, with the internet,

1104
00:46:59.994 --> 00:47:04.274
which is showing things at record speed,

1105
00:47:04.274 --> 00:47:08.506
and in real time, I just got a notification

1106
00:47:08.506 --> 00:47:09.446
in real time

1107
00:47:09.446 --> 00:47:13.083
as someone was having a sighting the night before last,

1108
00:47:13.083 --> 00:47:15.183
in Florida, in Orlando,

1109
00:47:15.183 --> 00:47:17.699
saying, "Does anybody around me see this?"

1110
00:47:17.699 --> 00:47:20.598
and we've even talked about

1111
00:47:20.598 --> 00:47:23.715
possibly getting a reporting center in real time

1112
00:47:23.715 --> 00:47:25.411
so that people can report the sightings

1113
00:47:25.411 --> 00:47:29.751
and we can keep track and those around the area

1114
00:47:29.751 --> 00:47:33.753
can also take note, so now, people with their cellphones

1115
00:47:33.753 --> 00:47:38.379
and cameras and so forth are capturing these things

1116
00:47:39.043 --> 00:47:40.061
around the world.

1117
00:47:40.061 --> 00:47:42.721
It cannot be explained or denied,

1118
00:47:42.721 --> 00:47:43.897
and I have to add this, too.

1119
00:47:43.897 --> 00:47:45.653
I mean there are,

1120
00:47:45.653 --> 00:47:49.029
when you look at the fact that our one solar system

1121
00:47:49.029 --> 00:47:50.605
is a very young solar system.

1122
00:47:50.605 --> 00:47:53.595
Our one galaxy, our Milky Way galaxy,

1123
00:47:53.595 --> 00:47:55.761
and there could be trillions out there,

1124
00:47:55.761 --> 00:47:58.861
is 14 to 16 billion years old.

1125
00:47:58.861 --> 00:48:01.521
Our solar system is a very young solar system.

1126
00:48:01.521 --> 00:48:03.841
It's only four to six billion years old.

1127
00:48:03.841 --> 00:48:05.537
There are scientists now postulating

1128
00:48:05.537 --> 00:48:09.777
that there could be intelligent, sentient beings out there,

1129
00:48:09.777 --> 00:48:10.753
billions.

1130
00:48:10.753 --> 00:48:11.649
<v Voiceover>Let's assume.</v>

1131
00:48:11.649 --> 00:48:13.549
<v ->Billions of years ahead of us,</v>

1132
00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:16.287
and NASA just came forward recently to say

1133
00:48:16.287 --> 00:48:18.745
that they have found microbes now

1134
00:48:18.745 --> 00:48:22.623
that are living beyond any comprehension

1135
00:48:22.623 --> 00:48:26.021
of, on arsenic, rather than phosphorus

1136
00:48:26.021 --> 00:48:27.659
and other amino acids,

1137
00:48:27.659 --> 00:48:31.539
which shows us that life is viable anywhere,

1138
00:48:31.539 --> 00:48:33.557
and we're seeing that just on earth.

1139
00:48:33.557 --> 00:48:35.357
From the hot springs of Yellowstone

1140
00:48:35.357 --> 00:48:37.415
to the frozen Arctic, so--

1141
00:48:37.415 --> 00:48:39.313
<v Voiceover>I think it would be, to me,</v>

1142
00:48:39.313 --> 00:48:42.361
it seems almost insane to assume otherwise, actually.

1143
00:48:43.891 --> 00:48:46.949
It's hard to track back what kind of belief systems

1144
00:48:46.949 --> 00:48:49.229
and dogma would have ever created a mindset

1145
00:48:49.229 --> 00:48:51.590
that we were somehow alone in this universe,

1146
00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:53.587
and so the fact that people like you are coming forward

1147
00:48:53.587 --> 00:48:55.107
and saying, "We can't ignore it any longer,

1148
00:48:55.107 --> 00:48:58.660
"we gotta look at this," yeah, I totally congratulate you

1149
00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:00.935
for what you've done so far and applaud you

1150
00:49:00.935 --> 00:49:02.795
for what you're getting ready to do,

1151
00:49:02.795 --> 00:49:05.510
and I appreciate your taking the time to do this with us.

1152
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:07.910
<v ->I appreciate you appreciating that</v>

1153
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:10.930
because, look, it took 17 centuries

1154
00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:14.450
for human beings to realize that there are zillions

1155
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:18.030
of tiny organisms all around us, even in our bodies.

1156
00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:20.570
Some are beneficial, some are pathogens.

1157
00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:22.210
We've learned to live with it,

1158
00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:24.910
and just in the past few decades,

1159
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:26.985
we've learned that there's electromagnetic energies

1160
00:49:26.985 --> 00:49:28.486
around every living cell.

1161
00:49:28.486 --> 00:49:31.781
Well just because we can't see these tiny living entities,

1162
00:49:31.781 --> 00:49:34.537
or electromagnetic energies, or gamma rays or radio waves,

1163
00:49:34.537 --> 00:49:36.592
whatever, it doesn't mean they're not real.

1164
00:49:36.592 --> 00:49:37.146
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

1165
00:49:37.146 --> 00:49:39.006
<v ->We may just be looking on the AM dial</v>

1166
00:49:39.006 --> 00:49:41.081
for the, an FM frequency,

1167
00:49:41.081 --> 00:49:43.461
so it's time we do get this out in the open

1168
00:49:43.461 --> 00:49:45.641
and even if we don't have the technology

1169
00:49:45.641 --> 00:49:48.302
to definitively define what these things are yet,

1170
00:49:48.302 --> 00:49:49.837
it doesn't mean they're not real.

1171
00:49:49.837 --> 00:49:50.412
<v Voiceover>That's right.</v>

1172
00:49:50.412 --> 00:49:53.852
<v ->So it's time we talk about it and we study it,</v>

1173
00:49:53.852 --> 00:49:55.967
and so we can move on in our own evolution.

1174
00:49:55.967 --> 00:49:58.388
Not only find out who's driving these things,

1175
00:49:58.388 --> 00:50:01.687
but also raise our consciousness

1176
00:50:01.687 --> 00:50:04.602
and evolve to a new place.

1177
00:50:04.602 --> 00:50:07.022
I think we're right on that precipice.

1178
00:50:07.022 --> 00:50:08.962
We're really getting ready to do that,

1179
00:50:08.962 --> 00:50:09.838
and one of the things

1180
00:50:09.838 --> 00:50:12.518
that I thought was really important

1181
00:50:12.518 --> 00:50:14.973
to express in the book,

1182
00:50:14.973 --> 00:50:16.869
and now in my speaking engagements,

1183
00:50:16.869 --> 00:50:19.369
is the fact that whoever is doing this,

1184
00:50:19.369 --> 00:50:22.570
whoever, and I don't know who's doing this.

1185
00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:25.269
Certainly, it could be spirit world,

1186
00:50:25.269 --> 00:50:28.189
it could be intergalactic, intragalactic,

1187
00:50:28.189 --> 00:50:30.144
time travelers, whoever.

1188
00:50:30.144 --> 00:50:31.040
It doesn't matter.

1189
00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.579
Whoever is doing this is not only intelligent

1190
00:50:33.579 --> 00:50:36.759
but certainly, they're trying to wake us up

1191
00:50:36.759 --> 00:50:39.274
not only to their presence,

1192
00:50:39.274 --> 00:50:42.484
but also to the spiritual beings that we are.

1193
00:50:42.484 --> 00:50:42.989
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1194
00:50:42.989 --> 00:50:46.529
<v ->That we have lost the connection to the source,</v>

1195
00:50:46.529 --> 00:50:49.104
and to the positiveness that we can be.

1196
00:50:49.104 --> 00:50:51.864
We live in such a beautiful, beautiful planet.

1197
00:50:51.864 --> 00:50:54.604
We are so fortunate and so blessed

1198
00:50:54.604 --> 00:50:58.789
that we are here, especially in this time in history,

1199
00:50:59.659 --> 00:51:02.654
that instead of appreciating that, unfortunately,

1200
00:51:02.654 --> 00:51:06.989
many people aren't awake to that yet,

1201
00:51:06.989 --> 00:51:09.584
but more and more people are becoming awake

1202
00:51:09.584 --> 00:51:12.184
and enlightened, and as I mentioned earlier,

1203
00:51:12.184 --> 00:51:14.624
these phenomena, whether it's near-death experience,

1204
00:51:14.624 --> 00:51:17.244
out of body, or unexplained aerial phenomena,

1205
00:51:17.244 --> 00:51:19.604
are waking people up to that,

1206
00:51:19.604 --> 00:51:22.764
and I applaud them and I applaud the people

1207
00:51:22.764 --> 00:51:25.804
that really take note and that are open.

1208
00:51:25.804 --> 00:51:29.004
That's the first step, to be open to the possibilities,

1209
00:51:29.004 --> 00:51:31.364
the wondrous possibilities of the universe,

1210
00:51:31.364 --> 00:51:34.640
and I thank you for doing this because it's important,

1211
00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.156
and that's one of the other reasons

1212
00:51:36.156 --> 00:51:38.916
that I came forward as a physician,

1213
00:51:38.916 --> 00:51:41.356
to let people know they're not alone.

1214
00:51:41.356 --> 00:51:44.296
That whatever their experience,

1215
00:51:44.296 --> 00:51:47.416
if it's real to them, and most things can be explained,

1216
00:51:47.416 --> 00:51:49.876
but a small percentage cannot.

1217
00:51:49.876 --> 00:51:52.076
And again, just because we don't have the technology yet

1218
00:51:52.076 --> 00:51:54.431
to definitively define what those things are,

1219
00:51:54.431 --> 00:51:56.206
it doesn't mean they're not real,

1220
00:51:56.206 --> 00:51:59.446
and they affect people at a very, very deep level,

1221
00:51:59.446 --> 00:52:01.766
so you know,

1222
00:52:01.766 --> 00:52:03.476
one of the major reasons that I came forward

1223
00:52:03.476 --> 00:52:06.196
is to let people know that it's OK,

1224
00:52:06.196 --> 00:52:07.492
it's important to talk about it.

1225
00:52:07.492 --> 00:52:09.551
Even if it's just to one other person,

1226
00:52:09.551 --> 00:52:11.177
it's healing, it's cathartic.

1227
00:52:11.177 --> 00:52:11.727
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1228
00:52:11.727 --> 00:52:12.902
<v ->And that they're not alone.</v>

1229
00:52:12.902 --> 00:52:13.937
<v Voiceover>Well thank you for talking</v>

1230
00:52:13.937 --> 00:52:15.482
to millions of people.

1231
00:52:18.372 --> 00:52:21.412
<v ->Lynne's book and documentary take the viewer step by step</v>

1232
00:52:21.412 --> 00:52:23.312
through the event as it unfolded,

1233
00:52:23.312 --> 00:52:24.952
and was later covered up.

1234
00:52:24.952 --> 00:52:26.612
You can find both on her website

1235
00:52:26.612 --> 00:52:28.867

1236
00:52:28.867 --> 00:52:30.387
