00:00:00.928 --> 00:00:03.668
<v ->Michael and I pick up our conversation from last month.</v>

2
00:00:03.668 --> 00:00:06.357
Focusing on what he feels were the roots of control,

3
00:00:06.357 --> 00:00:09.036
the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten and his followers

4
00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:11.377
who Michael calls the Autanus.

5
00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:13.376
The conversation covers much ground

6
00:00:13.376 --> 00:00:16.056
including the need to honor the cycles of life.

7
00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:19.917
In particular the season of destruction.

8
00:00:27.847 --> 00:00:29.464
<v Voiceover>In our last conversation we covered</v>

9
00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:32.584
an awful lot of ground about the architects of control

10
00:00:32.584 --> 00:00:35.903
and how it was even working its way through

11
00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:39.504
and covering up the traces of history and culture

12
00:00:39.504 --> 00:00:42.063
of the ancient, very refined Irish civilization.

13
00:00:42.063 --> 00:00:44.883
But we left it off at Akhenaten and Nefertiti

14
00:00:44.883 --> 00:00:46.563
which is really a big place in the story

15
00:00:46.563 --> 00:00:47.643
that you're presenting.

16
00:00:47.643 --> 00:00:50.804
You're saying Akhenaten may have actually been

17
00:00:50.804 --> 00:00:54.344
a very negative influence on cultures through to this day.

18
00:00:54.344 --> 00:00:56.343
And I think I mentioned at that point too

19
00:00:56.343 --> 00:00:58.624
that you're saying that there's evidence

20
00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:02.483
that his wife Nefertiti actually has Euro features,

21
00:01:02.483 --> 00:01:03.764
European features.

22
00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:04.783
<v ->Yeah, Western ancestors.</v>

23
00:01:04.783 --> 00:01:08.161
<v Voiceover>Western features and that their daughter Scota</v>

24
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:10.622
moved to Ireland and ended her life there.

25
00:01:10.622 --> 00:01:12.381
Okay, let's pick up the Akhenaten story.

26
00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:14.143
What's the problem with Akhenaten?

27
00:01:14.143 --> 00:01:16.841
<v ->Well, I'm one of, I think as far as I've been able</v>

28
00:01:16.841 --> 00:01:20.381
to count, two authors that take a negative view

29
00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:24.107
of this lionized man

30
00:01:24.107 --> 00:01:27.887
and I think when you review his life,

31
00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:29.327
his profile, and his theology,

32
00:01:29.327 --> 00:01:31.628
and also what he did to Egypt, just physically,

33
00:01:31.628 --> 00:01:32.707
I don't think there can be any doubt

34
00:01:32.707 --> 00:01:36.497
that the man was a raving lunatic, like a psychopath.

35
00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:38.494
Don't forget in my work I'm dating

36
00:01:38.494 --> 00:01:41.053
the architects of control from him.

37
00:01:41.053 --> 00:01:43.133
So of course, since they've commissioned the history

38
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:46.153
and he's their big chief, of course they're going to

39
00:01:46.153 --> 00:01:48.124
not see that and they're gonna lionize him

40
00:01:48.124 --> 00:01:49.159
and make him look in a good light.

41
00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.059
Which is what has happened.

42
00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:52.659
He's the Christ before the Christ, he's the great healer,

43
00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.692
the great revolutionary, the great reformer,

44
00:01:55.692 --> 00:01:58.291
the great sun king and all of this kind of concept.

45
00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:01.931
And many monarchs and potentates

46
00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:05.152
are really basing themselves on the pharaohs in general

47
00:02:05.152 --> 00:02:09.032
and on Akhenaten and Tutankhanum particularly.

48
00:02:09.032 --> 00:02:11.731
But the fascinating thing is that once

49
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.397
you again bend that rule.

50
00:02:13.397 --> 00:02:16.737
When you flip it around, do a bit of a Columbo here

51
00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:19.112
and say, "Well, maybe if we look at it this way"

52
00:02:19.112 --> 00:02:21.153
and you turn that fact around,

53
00:02:21.153 --> 00:02:23.492
suddenly a whole other reality opens

54
00:02:23.492 --> 00:02:27.033
which I think explains the world better.

55
00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:29.272
Part of that is his ancestry, his wife, his daughters.

56
00:02:29.272 --> 00:02:31.492
He had six daughters one of whom is supremely important

57
00:02:31.492 --> 00:02:34.092
in Irish mythology and Scottish since the word

58
00:02:34.092 --> 00:02:36.853
Scotland actually bears her name.

59
00:02:36.853 --> 00:02:38.792
Heavy duty stuff there.

60
00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:40.113
But once you get around the idea

61
00:02:40.113 --> 00:02:44.932
that he wasn't a totally together person, mentally.

62
00:02:44.932 --> 00:02:46.772
Then you start getting into interesting concepts

63
00:02:46.772 --> 00:02:49.273
about what solar worship is.

64
00:02:49.273 --> 00:02:50.692
Why do these people refer to themselves

65
00:02:50.692 --> 00:02:52.312
as the princes of light?

66
00:02:52.312 --> 00:02:53.472
What is light?

67
00:02:53.472 --> 00:02:55.033
Does light have some negative properties

68
00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:56.472
we don't understand?

69
00:02:56.472 --> 00:02:58.153
Is there a theology there connecting

70
00:02:58.153 --> 00:03:00.492
to the worship of light?

71
00:03:00.492 --> 00:03:03.213
And is Judea a Christianity perhaps based on that?

72
00:03:03.213 --> 00:03:05.293
Are all the religions solar religions?

73
00:03:05.293 --> 00:03:07.003
<v Voiceover>And you say these are basically Atenus</v>

74
00:03:07.003 --> 00:03:08.030
based on Atenus?

75
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.360
<v ->I use the word Atenus, because the god</v>

76
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.179
that Akhenaten worshiped was called Aten or Aton.

77
00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:16.610
Many letters transliterated down through time variance

78
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.530
changes and if you change the d to a t you have Adon,

79
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.710
the Adonai which Adon was a Phoenician god,

80
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.570
Adonai was a Judaic god, even if I use

81
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.800
the word Judaic in parentheses there.

82
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.210
And that's no different as any Jew knows

83
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.831
but we may not reveal, may not be too happy to accept.

84
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:41.870
Adonai is Jehovah.

85
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.850
So the Jehovah of the Bible is the Adon, is the Aton,

86
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.071
is the Adonai, is Oden.

87
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:49.755
<v voiceover>Okay, from Norse mythology?</v>

88
00:03:49.755 --> 00:03:52.006
<v ->The Norse, remember the West, East thing again.</v>

89
00:03:52.006 --> 00:03:54.553
So this is a universal God.

90
00:03:54.553 --> 00:03:56.348
Except that some people would argue

91
00:03:56.348 --> 00:03:58.808
and rightly so that Yahweh, Jehovah

92
00:03:58.808 --> 00:04:00.649
is sort of a composite deity.

93
00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:02.249
They're right because they all were.

94
00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:05.128
Many gods of the world were actually composite gods

95
00:04:05.128 --> 00:04:07.663
brought together by the merging of different groups,

96
00:04:07.663 --> 00:04:09.563
and different cults, and different races.

97
00:04:09.563 --> 00:04:10.778
<v Voiceover>So we're going back to the woman</v>

98
00:04:10.778 --> 00:04:11.925
in Akhenaten's life.

99
00:04:11.925 --> 00:04:16.570
We're looking at replacing the religion of the day,

100
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.291
which was based on the worship of Amun.

101
00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:22.410
Was that religion very similar to the druidic

102
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.373
in that it was based around the feminine principal

103
00:04:25.373 --> 00:04:27.113
and the Goddess?

104
00:04:27.113 --> 00:04:29.873
<v ->The Amunust and the Druidic connection</v>

105
00:04:29.873 --> 00:04:31.834
in my eyes is identical.

106
00:04:31.834 --> 00:04:34.813
And if there's differences,

107
00:04:34.813 --> 00:04:36.799
as far as I can see it's cosmetic.

108
00:04:36.799 --> 00:04:38.939
They not only had a perfectly balanced

109
00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:41.600
and that's not to say they didn't have reprehensible

110
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.028
aspects of their theology, I'm not promoting them.

111
00:04:45.028 --> 00:04:45.918
I'm just, you know, pointing out --

112
00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Voiceover>You're just talking about similarities.</v>

113
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.374
<v ->Yeah. I'm not an amunist.</v>

114
00:04:49.374 --> 00:04:51.174
I'm not trying to say there better than the Atunus

115
00:04:51.174 --> 00:04:52.898
or whatever, I'm just trying to define

116
00:04:52.898 --> 00:04:54.177
that they were these two different groups

117
00:04:54.177 --> 00:04:55.718
and they had great differences.

118
00:04:55.718 --> 00:04:57.338
But the beautiful thing about the amunist system

119
00:04:57.338 --> 00:05:00.108
was it was tripartite.

120
00:05:00.108 --> 00:05:01.783
It wasn't just a polarity of masculine and feminine,

121
00:05:01.783 --> 00:05:03.643
they even had a third principal.

122
00:05:03.643 --> 00:05:08.414
Just like you have Osaris, Horis, and Isis.

123
00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:12.464
As soon as you see the triad principal,

124
00:05:12.464 --> 00:05:15.124
you know you're talking druidism, right from that point on

125
00:05:15.124 --> 00:05:16.824
because the druids are the well known people

126
00:05:16.824 --> 00:05:18.484
who worship the three and the triangle

127
00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:19.985
and they had their own trinity.

128
00:05:19.985 --> 00:05:21.824
You know you're talking the aria of Northern India

129
00:05:21.824 --> 00:05:23.653
because they had their Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva.

130
00:05:23.653 --> 00:05:26.893
That trinity, that concept is all over the ancient

131
00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:28.992
solar cults and stellar cults of the world.

132
00:05:28.992 --> 00:05:30.792
That's just one small anecdote.

133
00:05:30.792 --> 00:05:32.612
But I do believe their ideology, their pantheon,

134
00:05:32.612 --> 00:05:34.553
their cosmology was much more balanced

135
00:05:34.553 --> 00:05:36.392
than what the Atenists came up with.

136
00:05:36.392 --> 00:05:37.713
<v Voiceover>So the Atenists came up with</v>

137
00:05:37.713 --> 00:05:41.032
a solo worship of what is perceived

138
00:05:41.032 --> 00:05:43.551
as the male aspect as the sun.

139
00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:44.572
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

140
00:05:44.572 --> 00:05:46.491
<v Voiceover>And so this became monotheism.</v>

141
00:05:46.491 --> 00:05:47.572
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

142
00:05:47.572 --> 00:05:48.671
<v Voiceover>And now as a result,</v>

143
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:52.142
it wiped out and it was intended to wipe out

144
00:05:52.142 --> 00:05:56.192
any of the earth, essentially the,

145
00:05:58.062 --> 00:05:59.298
what is the word I'm looking for?

146
00:05:59.298 --> 00:06:00.918
When you're talking about the more balanced

147
00:06:00.918 --> 00:06:03.617
natural order of the religions of the day.

148
00:06:03.617 --> 00:06:04.538
<v ->Yeah, sure.</v>

149
00:06:04.538 --> 00:06:05.678
<v Voiceover>So it was intended specifically</v>

150
00:06:05.678 --> 00:06:07.377
to wipe that out.

151
00:06:07.377 --> 00:06:08.637
<v ->Aggressively so.</v>

152
00:06:08.637 --> 00:06:10.277
In fact all monotheism,

153
00:06:10.277 --> 00:06:11.638
as many people like Leonard Schilling

154
00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:13.617
have pointed out, is aggressive from point go.

155
00:06:13.617 --> 00:06:15.917
It is exclusionary, not inclusive.

156
00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.278
You see, in the period before the Atenists rules

157
00:06:18.278 --> 00:06:20.637
every other culture, Phoenician, Semetic,

158
00:06:20.637 --> 00:06:23.277
Cretin, Grecian, Hyksos, whatever.

159
00:06:23.277 --> 00:06:25.577
All of these people basically lived together in harmony.

160
00:06:25.577 --> 00:06:26.577
They could worship in harmony

161
00:06:26.577 --> 00:06:29.617
and they saw commonality between their various gods.

162
00:06:29.617 --> 00:06:31.218
In fact, many gods are the same god under

163
00:06:31.218 --> 00:06:32.937
different names.

164
00:06:32.937 --> 00:06:34.897
When the Atenists come along and they make this

165
00:06:34.897 --> 00:06:37.817
absolutely,

166
00:06:37.817 --> 00:06:39.517
they were henotheistic in the sense that they picked

167
00:06:39.517 --> 00:06:40.817
one god for many because

168
00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:44.505
Aton did as a god predate Akhenaten,

169
00:06:44.505 --> 00:06:46.805
he was worshipped by Akhenaten's forefathers.

170
00:06:46.805 --> 00:06:49.460
Thutmosis I think one of them was an Atenists as well,

171
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.967
yeah, they were there.

172
00:06:50.967 --> 00:06:52.647
But he selected this god of light

173
00:06:52.647 --> 00:06:54.668
and lionized him more and promoted this.

174
00:06:54.668 --> 00:06:57.227
And by doing that it was very aggressively exclusionary.

175
00:06:57.227 --> 00:06:59.428
And this included the feminine aspects,

176
00:06:59.428 --> 00:07:01.348
the matriarchal cults also.

177
00:07:01.348 --> 00:07:03.087
<v Voiceover>And at the same time,</v>

178
00:07:03.087 --> 00:07:05.028
that period, that 18th dynasty,

179
00:07:05.028 --> 00:07:07.627
was known for perpetuating artwork

180
00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:09.229
for the first time even,

181
00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:11.268
where the mother, the father, and the children,

182
00:07:11.268 --> 00:07:12.688
are all depicted together.

183
00:07:12.688 --> 00:07:14.087
But under the rays of the sun.

184
00:07:14.087 --> 00:07:15.647
<v ->But that's bogus. Exactly.</v>

185
00:07:15.647 --> 00:07:17.607
This is a propaganda, you see.

186
00:07:17.607 --> 00:07:20.627
And don't forget it was only his family.

187
00:07:20.627 --> 00:07:21.856
The chief Atenists.

188
00:07:21.856 --> 00:07:23.636
Again it was an exclusionary thing.

189
00:07:23.636 --> 00:07:25.936
But see, I mean Akhenaten went as far as to

190
00:07:25.936 --> 00:07:27.863
prevent Kiya, his second wife,

191
00:07:27.863 --> 00:07:29.404
from even using her full name,

192
00:07:29.404 --> 00:07:31.131
which was an Armanist name,

193
00:07:31.131 --> 00:07:32.631
and it meant the Vulture Goddess,

194
00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:34.152
which was again the old Pantheons.

195
00:07:34.152 --> 00:07:36.432
She could only, you know, he wouldn't allow that.

196
00:07:36.432 --> 00:07:40.791
In fact I think he only gave her the permission

197
00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:42.372
finally, and that was because you know,

198
00:07:42.372 --> 00:07:43.571
he just had to.

199
00:07:43.571 --> 00:07:44.951
She was the only one who was able to bend the rule

200
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:47.341
at all to be able to use some of her titles

201
00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:50.419
that were previously from an Armanist basis,

202
00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:53.537
you know, everybody else was absolutely no way, no deal.

203
00:07:53.537 --> 00:07:54.855
I mean he was very strict.

204
00:07:54.855 --> 00:07:57.036
They went to bed as soon as the sun set.

205
00:07:57.036 --> 00:07:58.895
They were pathologically afraid of the dark.

206
00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:01.396
They cancelled the Osirian cycle of the underworld,

207
00:08:01.396 --> 00:08:03.116
which psychologically, if Freud were sitting here,

208
00:08:03.116 --> 00:08:05.855
he'd go, "Well, we have a problem there for sure."

209
00:08:05.855 --> 00:08:08.095
You're negating the dark side right away.

210
00:08:08.095 --> 00:08:09.856
So don't you see when I would say that

211
00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:11.335
there's some psychopathy involved,

212
00:08:11.335 --> 00:08:13.916
I can back that up. I can back that up.

213
00:08:13.916 --> 00:08:16.036
If you are denying the underworld cycle,

214
00:08:16.036 --> 00:08:19.355
you are cancelling out the dark side,

215
00:08:19.355 --> 00:08:21.635
even the physical darkness?

216
00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:23.575
That is as good a definition of schizoid

217
00:08:23.575 --> 00:08:25.916
as I could possibly come up with.

218
00:08:25.916 --> 00:08:27.615
I mean, there's people locked up here, you know,

219
00:08:27.615 --> 00:08:29.915
raving lunatics operate on that level.

220
00:08:29.915 --> 00:08:32.256
So this man was a Pharaoh but with meglomania,

221
00:08:32.256 --> 00:08:33.895
with a psychopathy.

222
00:08:33.895 --> 00:08:37.636
But he had the power, you see, to change Egypt.

223
00:08:37.636 --> 00:08:39.475
And change ultimately the world because

224
00:08:39.475 --> 00:08:41.496
as we hoped again, two of his descendents ended up

225
00:08:41.496 --> 00:08:43.755
backing out of the ancient homeland, you see.

226
00:08:43.755 --> 00:08:45.783
<v Voiceover>So okay, let's say, you know Nefertiti,</v>

227
00:08:45.783 --> 00:08:47.163
they had their six daughters.

228
00:08:47.163 --> 00:08:48.756
Scota makes her way back to Ireland,

229
00:08:48.756 --> 00:08:50.957
and you're saying that Nefertiti may have been

230
00:08:50.957 --> 00:08:54.356
also what appears to be of Caucasian heritage as well.

231
00:08:54.356 --> 00:08:56.096
<v ->I think she was a member of what is</v>

232
00:08:56.096 --> 00:08:58.078
to be specific about it,

233
00:08:58.078 --> 00:09:00.117
she was a Scythian, what's known as a Scythian.

234
00:09:00.117 --> 00:09:01.696
<v Voiceover>And can you explain what that is?</v>

235
00:09:01.696 --> 00:09:04.606
<v ->Scythian technically is a Celt,</v>

236
00:09:04.606 --> 00:09:06.024
one of their homelands was in Turkey

237
00:09:06.024 --> 00:09:07.927
but they were known to be, the Irish annals

238
00:09:07.927 --> 00:09:10.247
clearly tell you that they were European, you know.

239
00:09:10.247 --> 00:09:11.967
But because of these catastrophes,

240
00:09:11.967 --> 00:09:13.827
they were displaced groups were in all sorts

241
00:09:13.827 --> 00:09:15.067
of different places.

242
00:09:15.067 --> 00:09:17.288
There's a city called Scythopolis in Galilee

243
00:09:17.288 --> 00:09:21.087
which is purported to be a Scythian capital.

244
00:09:21.087 --> 00:09:22.847
So basically in Galilee they were settled.

245
00:09:22.847 --> 00:09:25.287
In Turkey they were, in Jordan they were,

246
00:09:25.287 --> 00:09:26.868
and all through Turkey and Europe

247
00:09:26.868 --> 00:09:29.787
and Anatolia, Cappadocia, these were their headquarters.

248
00:09:29.787 --> 00:09:32.587
The reason why we think, although I would think

249
00:09:32.587 --> 00:09:35.047
I'm the only one who thinks she's Scythian,

250
00:09:35.047 --> 00:09:37.027
but as you say the rumor was that she may have had

251
00:09:37.027 --> 00:09:39.167
Western people, Lorraine Evans and a few other scholars

252
00:09:39.167 --> 00:09:40.628
have sort of dabbled in that,

253
00:09:40.628 --> 00:09:42.588
is just the look of her face.

254
00:09:42.588 --> 00:09:44.128
<v Voiceover>Yes, she does look very distinctly different</v>

255
00:09:44.128 --> 00:09:45.734
than the other queens of that time.

256
00:09:45.734 --> 00:09:48.295
<v ->That's right. And also no ancestry, no history.</v>

257
00:09:48.295 --> 00:09:50.475
It's like it's been suppressed or whatever.

258
00:09:50.475 --> 00:09:52.954
To me, it's a no-brainer because her daughter,

259
00:09:52.954 --> 00:09:56.274
her chief daughter whose nickname was Scotia.

260
00:09:56.274 --> 00:10:00.014
Scythians weren't called Scythians in Scythian times,

261
00:10:00.014 --> 00:10:01.594
they were called the Scots.

262
00:10:01.594 --> 00:10:03.214
<v Voiceover>The Scots. Okay.</v>

263
00:10:03.214 --> 00:10:05.894
<v ->In their own era. They were also called Musagete.</v>

264
00:10:05.894 --> 00:10:09.974
They were also called Saga, or Shatka, which means stag.

265
00:10:09.974 --> 00:10:13.554
The stag man. Satka. Staga. Saga.

266
00:10:13.554 --> 00:10:16.394
Where we get the modern word "sage."

267
00:10:16.394 --> 00:10:18.194
So they were the sages, they were the wise ones.

268
00:10:18.194 --> 00:10:20.454
So even then they took a name that meant the wise ones,

269
00:10:20.454 --> 00:10:22.154
you're dealing with the wise ones here.

270
00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:24.934
They're descendants of the Arya ultimately,

271
00:10:24.934 --> 00:10:27.134
before they became Atenists, they were all basically

272
00:10:27.134 --> 00:10:29.014
the same gang of the people that I'm talking about,

273
00:10:29.014 --> 00:10:30.534
the Arya, the Druids, okay?

274
00:10:30.534 --> 00:10:32.014
Although they became what I believe corrupted

275
00:10:32.014 --> 00:10:33.874
by the time they became Atenists in Egypt,

276
00:10:33.874 --> 00:10:34.814
they were goners.

277
00:10:34.814 --> 00:10:36.034
<v Voiceover>They were corrupted. Okay.</v>

278
00:10:36.034 --> 00:10:38.014
<v ->Yeah. So Scota's own nickname,</v>

279
00:10:38.014 --> 00:10:39.494
she was really called Meritaten,

280
00:10:39.494 --> 00:10:41.854
which means the beautiful one of Aton, right?

281
00:10:41.854 --> 00:10:46.054
We get the biblical word Mary from the Egyptian meri.

282
00:10:46.054 --> 00:10:49.674
And I think there's a connection to the plant myrrh

283
00:10:49.674 --> 00:10:51.354
is where we get the word Mary.

284
00:10:51.354 --> 00:10:53.964
Ralph Ellis and others think it actually just means

285
00:10:53.964 --> 00:10:58.694
the beautiful one, it's the origin of Mary in the Bible.

286
00:10:58.694 --> 00:11:02.794
So Meritaten's nickname is the name of the Scythian people,

287
00:11:02.794 --> 00:11:04.054
and her mother is Nefertiti,

288
00:11:04.054 --> 00:11:05.694
the beautiful one who has come, right,

289
00:11:05.694 --> 00:11:06.834
with her aquiline features that even

290
00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:09.424
(mumbles) said, "I think she's Western," you know.

291
00:11:09.424 --> 00:11:11.862
It's pretty obvious, right.

292
00:11:11.862 --> 00:11:15.002
So these characters were Scythian, Egyptian,

293
00:11:15.002 --> 00:11:17.142
Akhenaten's own family.

294
00:11:17.142 --> 00:11:19.201
After the cataclysms, after the famine

295
00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:20.962
that happened in Egypt,

296
00:11:20.962 --> 00:11:22.721
after the displacement or let's say expulsion

297
00:11:22.721 --> 00:11:26.541
of Akhenaten, they needed to leave.

298
00:11:26.541 --> 00:11:27.901
And they took refuge amongst a group

299
00:11:27.901 --> 00:11:31.201
called the Hyksos who were also Scythian in my view.

300
00:11:31.201 --> 00:11:34.101
These Hyksos have now been 100% proven

301
00:11:34.101 --> 00:11:36.702
to be the same people as the Israelites.

302
00:11:36.702 --> 00:11:38.281
There is no doubt about it,

303
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:40.782
and there can't be in the mind of any sane reader at all.

304
00:11:40.782 --> 00:11:42.061
<v Voiceover>Which becomes interesting,</v>

305
00:11:42.061 --> 00:11:43.802
because there is some work by Laurence Gardner

306
00:11:43.802 --> 00:11:45.942
for example who would say that Akhenaten

307
00:11:45.942 --> 00:11:47.342
and Moses are one in the same.

308
00:11:47.342 --> 00:11:49.582
Some others would say, "No actually, they were brothers."

309
00:11:49.582 --> 00:11:51.568
But they're putting them in the same ballpark

310
00:11:51.568 --> 00:11:52.608
in terms of that migration.

311
00:11:52.608 --> 00:11:53.654
<v ->But he's not the first.</v>

312
00:11:53.654 --> 00:11:55.174
Conor MacDari was already dealing with that

313
00:11:55.174 --> 00:11:56.293
at the turn of the century.

314
00:11:56.293 --> 00:11:58.359
Then it was picked up very strongly in 1930

315
00:11:58.359 --> 00:12:00.019
with Sigmund Freud whose last book was

316
00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:02.498
Moses and Monotheism.

317
00:12:02.498 --> 00:12:04.339
Immanuel Velikovsky looked at it,

318
00:12:04.339 --> 00:12:08.938
Freud's colleague Dr. Karl Abraham very much believed.

319
00:12:08.938 --> 00:12:10.389
In fact if you want to get into specifics,

320
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:12.948
Karl Abraham believed they were the same,

321
00:12:12.948 --> 00:12:14.288
and Freud wouldn't go so far.

322
00:12:14.288 --> 00:12:15.489
He said, "Let's keep it open."

323
00:12:15.489 --> 00:12:16.889
But he was in the circle, he was a priest

324
00:12:16.889 --> 00:12:18.268
in the circle of Akhenaten,

325
00:12:18.268 --> 00:12:19.548
meaning Moses was a priest in the circle

326
00:12:19.548 --> 00:12:20.688
of Akhenaten.

327
00:12:20.688 --> 00:12:21.728
But Abrahams had already gone,

328
00:12:21.728 --> 00:12:23.489
"No man, face it, they're one in the same thing."

329
00:12:23.489 --> 00:12:24.348
<v Voiceover>What do you think?</v>

330
00:12:24.348 --> 00:12:25.389
<v ->They're one in the same thing.</v>

331
00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:27.268
<v Voiceover>Okay, Akhenaten and Moses are one in the same.</v>

332
00:12:27.268 --> 00:12:30.129
So let's proceed with that.

333
00:12:30.129 --> 00:12:31.928
<v ->Well then this opens a whole ball of wax.</v>

334
00:12:31.928 --> 00:12:33.228
<v Voiceover>Yeah. Lots of implications.</v>

335
00:12:33.228 --> 00:12:34.869
<v ->Well the one thing that Freud always pointed to</v>

336
00:12:34.869 --> 00:12:39.368
was the fact that Moses, meaning son of, or son of,

337
00:12:39.368 --> 00:12:42.464
is found in Tuthmosis, you know, Ramosis,

338
00:12:42.464 --> 00:12:44.705
Amosis, it's an Egyptian name.

339
00:12:44.705 --> 00:12:47.405
Ramosis means son of Ra.

340
00:12:47.405 --> 00:12:50.065
So Moses is already an Egyptian name.

341
00:12:50.065 --> 00:12:52.306
The raising of the standard.

342
00:12:52.306 --> 00:12:54.005
<v Voiceover>Tithmosis the fourth, by the way.</v>

343
00:12:54.005 --> 00:12:56.245
<v ->Right, Tithmosis is Akhenaten's father.</v>

344
00:12:56.245 --> 00:12:57.425
<v Voiceover>That's right.</v>

345
00:12:57.425 --> 00:12:59.884
<v ->No, Tithmosis the fourth, is.</v>

346
00:12:59.884 --> 00:13:02.592
<v Voiceover>Akhenaten is Tithmosis the fourth I believe.</v>

347
00:13:02.592 --> 00:13:05.112
<v ->Right, Amenhotep the fourth, maybe I'm wrong.</v>

348
00:13:05.112 --> 00:13:06.953
<v Voiceover>No you're right. Amenhotep the fourth.</v>

349
00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:09.212
<v ->Okay and his father was Tithmosis the fourth.</v>

350
00:13:09.212 --> 00:13:10.953
But there is that famous name.

351
00:13:10.953 --> 00:13:12.473
In fact when you get into that Tith.

352
00:13:12.473 --> 00:13:14.512
That's a big one right there.

353
00:13:14.512 --> 00:13:17.953
Because the t's are really meant to be d's.

354
00:13:17.953 --> 00:13:21.393
T-U-T for Tut is where you get the word Chtutin,

355
00:13:21.393 --> 00:13:23.192
we're back to the Western connection,

356
00:13:23.192 --> 00:13:25.532
the Tudors of England, alright.

357
00:13:25.532 --> 00:13:27.633
Where does this T-U, where, Tutar.

358
00:13:27.633 --> 00:13:30.052
You know, a teacher is a tutor.

359
00:13:30.052 --> 00:13:31.692
Where do all of these T-U-Ts come from

360
00:13:31.692 --> 00:13:33.112
that we find even in Egypt?

361
00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:34.673
<v Voiceover>Atlantean.</v>

362
00:13:34.673 --> 00:13:36.612
<v ->You see, and that is really D-V-D,</v>

363
00:13:36.612 --> 00:13:39.951
the d's, the sound of d can sound like t,

364
00:13:39.951 --> 00:13:42.071
when you put the d back, you have the D-U-D

365
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:45.470
or the D-V-D which is D-V-D is David, the Davids.

366
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.091
So Tithmosis is really a David,

367
00:13:48.091 --> 00:13:50.470
the commander of Aton, a commander of Amon,

368
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.550
you know, a commander.

369
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.071
<v Voiceover>At this point when Akhenaten</v>

370
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:57.180
has to leave Egypt.

371
00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.049
You're saying that's where in the story

372
00:13:59.049 --> 00:14:03.698
the Bible would pick up of Moses leading his people

373
00:14:03.698 --> 00:14:07.796
through these times, these very Spartan times

374
00:14:07.796 --> 00:14:09.016
in the desert.

375
00:14:09.016 --> 00:14:10.577
<v ->Exactly, we don't exactly know what happened</v>

376
00:14:10.577 --> 00:14:12.376
to Akhenaten himself.

377
00:14:12.376 --> 00:14:15.477
A great contingent of his people went to Thanos,

378
00:14:15.477 --> 00:14:18.156
which is up in the Delta to take refuge.

379
00:14:18.156 --> 00:14:20.836
And then the Bible story talking about the holy people

380
00:14:20.836 --> 00:14:23.477
leaving and being taken into captivities,

381
00:14:23.477 --> 00:14:24.736
we're talking about this era.

382
00:14:24.736 --> 00:14:26.896
The expulsion of the so-called Israelites from Egypt,

383
00:14:26.896 --> 00:14:28.456
it was a cover story.

384
00:14:28.456 --> 00:14:30.836
A fictional account.

385
00:14:30.836 --> 00:14:32.117
I've described the Bible as nothing more

386
00:14:32.117 --> 00:14:34.497
as the chronicle of the Atenists,

387
00:14:34.497 --> 00:14:36.457
or a book of the Pharaohs, which it is,

388
00:14:36.457 --> 00:14:39.477
if you really know what you're reading.

389
00:14:41.027 --> 00:14:42.625
And the most fascinating thing goes back

390
00:14:42.625 --> 00:14:44.992
to Scota herself.

391
00:14:44.992 --> 00:14:47.452
She ends up marrying a person that is

392
00:14:47.452 --> 00:14:51.272
of monumental importance in Irish legends.

393
00:14:51.912 --> 00:14:54.182
Which was King Mile, M-I-L-E,

394
00:14:54.182 --> 00:14:56.722
where we get the word militia from, you know.

395
00:14:56.722 --> 00:15:00.281
And he was a Scythian king from a very prestigious line

396
00:15:00.281 --> 00:15:01.682
equal to the Pharaohs.

397
00:15:01.682 --> 00:15:03.262
Maybe a little bit less, but certainly

398
00:15:03.262 --> 00:15:04.621
from a mystery school point of view,

399
00:15:04.621 --> 00:15:05.721
from an esoteric point of view,

400
00:15:05.721 --> 00:15:07.981
they were on the same rank as the Pharaohs.

401
00:15:07.981 --> 00:15:10.782
These are Scythian Celts.

402
00:15:12.142 --> 00:15:14.079
The rumor is, or the annals are saying

403
00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:17.999
that Mile and Scota and their whole gang,

404
00:15:17.999 --> 00:15:21.699
they are basically the same people as the Atenists.

405
00:15:21.699 --> 00:15:23.539
There's no difference between these people.

406
00:15:23.539 --> 00:15:26.520
They start migrating back to their ancestral homes.

407
00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.760
They don't just go off elsewhere,

408
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.099
they make a sort of little journey.

409
00:15:30.099 --> 00:15:32.219
Now in Western history you will hear about these people.

410
00:15:32.219 --> 00:15:34.799
There are certain Celtic books, books on the Irish history

411
00:15:34.799 --> 00:15:36.979
that will pick up about the story of the Atenists,

412
00:15:36.979 --> 00:15:39.579
but they always only stop at Spain.

413
00:15:39.579 --> 00:15:40.839
Because when these people moved west

414
00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:42.020
and got to Spain.

415
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.539
<v Voiceover>What about Ralph Ellis' work?</v>

416
00:15:43.539 --> 00:15:45.520
<v ->Ralph Ellis is pretty much doing the same thing</v>

417
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.719
when it comes to the Scythians.

418
00:15:47.719 --> 00:15:49.759
Unfortunately there's a little glitch there,

419
00:15:49.759 --> 00:15:51.779
plus he's very weak on the Scythians.

420
00:15:51.779 --> 00:15:55.260
He has not been able to make the Hyksos-Scythian connection.

421
00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.000
For whatever reason he talks about Cretins,

422
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.320
he talks about they maybe have been connected

423
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.999
with the Philistines,

424
00:16:00.999 --> 00:16:02.299
and this is not, he's not the only one,

425
00:16:02.299 --> 00:16:04.860
there seems to be some strange reason.

426
00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:05.939
Oh I know what it is actually,

427
00:16:05.939 --> 00:16:07.559
it's because to do that opens up the whole

428
00:16:07.559 --> 00:16:09.560
west to east movement of the elements of civilization

429
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.560
which they won't touch.

430
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.358
<v Voiceover>Alright. So let's go on then.</v>

431
00:16:12.358 --> 00:16:15.697
<v ->So a very important question though.</v>

432
00:16:15.697 --> 00:16:19.078
But the thing is that now you have this migration.

433
00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:22.698
As I said Celtic scholars will tacitly admit,

434
00:16:22.698 --> 00:16:24.637
"Oh yeah, well we know about the Milesians"

435
00:16:24.637 --> 00:16:26.817
"and the potential of the Egyptian princess"

436
00:16:26.817 --> 00:16:30.238
"that came with them coming over from Spain."

437
00:16:30.238 --> 00:16:32.277
But they will rarely go further back than that,

438
00:16:32.277 --> 00:16:33.718
you see, unfortunately.

439
00:16:33.718 --> 00:16:35.478
But now we have the evidence through

440
00:16:35.478 --> 00:16:37.334
the Ralph Ellis', the Moustafa Gadallas,

441
00:16:37.334 --> 00:16:38.574
and Ahmed Osmans,

442
00:16:38.574 --> 00:16:39.674
this is coming to light

443
00:16:39.674 --> 00:16:41.554
previously as I said through Sigmund Freud

444
00:16:41.554 --> 00:16:43.758
and Karl (mumbles) and what have you.

445
00:16:43.758 --> 00:16:46.618
And the incredible story is that her name meant Scythian,

446
00:16:46.618 --> 00:16:49.558
she was the woman who finally gave her name to Scotland.

447
00:16:49.558 --> 00:16:52.998
But before Ireland was called Scota,

448
00:16:52.998 --> 00:16:55.698
before Scotland was called Scota, or Scota,

449
00:16:55.698 --> 00:16:57.038
Ireland was the name.

450
00:16:57.038 --> 00:16:58.518
It's because the Irish went over to Scotland

451
00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.279
and brought their princess' name

452
00:17:00.279 --> 00:17:01.698
that Scotland took its name.

453
00:17:01.698 --> 00:17:03.999
Ireland was once called Scota.

454
00:17:03.999 --> 00:17:08.885
Scota's physical grave is in County Kerry, you know.

455
00:17:08.885 --> 00:17:11.465
And Lorraine Evans will tell you in her book

456
00:17:11.465 --> 00:17:13.865
Kingdom of the Ark about all the other Egyptian artifacts

457
00:17:13.865 --> 00:17:16.625
that have literally been dug up and can't be explained.

458
00:17:16.625 --> 00:17:18.265
And she talks about Nefertiti,

459
00:17:18.265 --> 00:17:19.566
she's made the Nefertiti connection,

460
00:17:19.566 --> 00:17:21.706
she's made the connection to Akhenaten.

461
00:17:23.436 --> 00:17:25.445
So it's not Akhenaten himself,

462
00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:27.425
nor even for that matter Tutankhamun,

463
00:17:27.425 --> 00:17:30.273
you see or even Aya, right, the Pharaoh Aya.

464
00:17:30.273 --> 00:17:32.033
We're not talking about them physically themselves

465
00:17:32.033 --> 00:17:33.413
coming out to the West,

466
00:17:33.413 --> 00:17:34.913
but their descendants.

467
00:17:34.913 --> 00:17:36.797
Certainly Scota, the connection is there.

468
00:17:36.797 --> 00:17:38.725
The Irish legends talk about it,

469
00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:41.425
the Scottish legends talk about it.

470
00:17:41.425 --> 00:17:43.966
You see, basically it's a well-known anecdote

471
00:17:43.966 --> 00:17:45.806
in the ancient Celtic mythology

472
00:17:45.806 --> 00:17:47.505
as the coming of the Egyptian princess.

473
00:17:47.505 --> 00:17:52.325
<v Voiceover>So it's effect was by hooking up with.</v>

474
00:17:52.325 --> 00:17:54.195
<v ->Now we're full circle.</v>

475
00:17:54.195 --> 00:17:56.816
Now we're full circle, because look at the dates.

476
00:17:56.816 --> 00:18:00.136
I believe that in Irish mythology there's a,

477
00:18:00.136 --> 00:18:01.236
they know the story of the coming of

478
00:18:01.236 --> 00:18:03.675
what they call the Milesians after King Mile

479
00:18:03.675 --> 00:18:05.075
and his wife.

480
00:18:05.075 --> 00:18:06.256
<v Voiceover>And I think I read in your book that</v>

481
00:18:06.256 --> 00:18:09.214
King Mile was a little off-center.

482
00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:10.214
<v ->His son was.</v>

483
00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:11.933
<v Voiceover>Oh his son was off-center, Don.</v>

484
00:18:11.933 --> 00:18:15.914
<v ->Adon. Adoni. But Mile's son is called Don.</v>

485
00:18:15.914 --> 00:18:17.853
And his other one, I mean the names are amazing

486
00:18:17.853 --> 00:18:18.822
when you get into this.

487
00:18:18.822 --> 00:18:19.723
<v Voiceover>Okay, sorry I got that one wrong.</v>

488
00:18:19.723 --> 00:18:20.416
So it was his son.

489
00:18:20.416 --> 00:18:23.645
<v ->You know what his other son was called? Aron.</v>

490
00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:25.813
That's not biblical. Right, so.

491
00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:30.473
When they arrived, then we notice a date. 500 BC.

492
00:18:30.473 --> 00:18:33.153
Rome has just risen, 700 BC.

493
00:18:33.153 --> 00:18:35.154
You know, you can chart their movement I believe across.

494
00:18:35.154 --> 00:18:37.033
Ralph has done this, Ralph Ellis has done this

495
00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:38.393
to a certain extent.

496
00:18:38.393 --> 00:18:40.193
And you can take it yourself

497
00:18:40.193 --> 00:18:41.614
and see this incredible paradigm

498
00:18:41.614 --> 00:18:46.313
coming through Greece, Athens. Athen, Aton. Athens.

499
00:18:46.313 --> 00:18:48.074
You know, you can see this movement.

500
00:18:48.074 --> 00:18:49.293
<v Voiceover>But this is considerably later</v>

501
00:18:49.293 --> 00:18:52.782
because you're talking Akhenaten was actually 1300 years BC,

502
00:18:52.782 --> 00:18:54.321
now we're talking 500 years BC.

503
00:18:54.321 --> 00:18:55.582
<v ->Right, because this is a movement.</v>

504
00:18:55.582 --> 00:18:57.001
This is a decision making process,

505
00:18:57.001 --> 00:18:59.101
there's the moving to Spain.

506
00:18:59.101 --> 00:19:00.641
In between the move to Spain,

507
00:19:00.641 --> 00:19:02.061
they've already moved back to Scythia.

508
00:19:02.061 --> 00:19:03.481
Mile and Scota.

509
00:19:03.481 --> 00:19:06.861
And these people, you know, there's a movement here.

510
00:19:06.861 --> 00:19:09.301
How do you work out how this could be done

511
00:19:09.301 --> 00:19:10.322
in this timeline?

512
00:19:10.322 --> 00:19:11.742
This is an interesting timeline.

513
00:19:11.742 --> 00:19:13.330
And then then there are (mumbles) but we go through that

514
00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.509
to show you how this figures.

515
00:19:15.509 --> 00:19:17.230
It's hard to in a few minutes explain.

516
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:18.050
<v Voiceover>We only have a few minutes</v>

517
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.380
so let's just, you move onto the net effect of it.

518
00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.616
<v ->And that effect is when the Milesians get to Ireland</v>

519
00:19:22.616 --> 00:19:26.955
about 500 BC, you have they're starting to,

520
00:19:26.955 --> 00:19:29.395
you have a campaign of genocide again

521
00:19:29.395 --> 00:19:33.034
where the matriarchal cults of Ireland

522
00:19:33.034 --> 00:19:34.510
who are ancestral, these are going,

523
00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:37.939
they're hardcore Arya, they're very pure, Druidic schools

524
00:19:37.939 --> 00:19:39.996
start to be slowly annihilated.

525
00:19:39.996 --> 00:19:42.156
And that process of cannibalization

526
00:19:42.156 --> 00:19:44.615
and colonization takes about 1,000 years.

527
00:19:44.615 --> 00:19:45.836
Which will then of course do what?

528
00:19:45.836 --> 00:19:48.276
That will bring us up past the era of Christianity.

529
00:19:48.276 --> 00:19:49.117
<v Voiceover>500 AD.</v>

530
00:19:49.117 --> 00:19:49.856
<v ->Yeah.</v>

531
00:19:49.856 --> 00:19:52.696
So the rise of Christianity is commensurate,

532
00:19:52.696 --> 00:19:54.115
not just with the rise of the Templars

533
00:19:54.115 --> 00:19:56.056
in the 13th century and all of that,

534
00:19:56.056 --> 00:19:59.496
but the rise of Christianity about 300 AD

535
00:19:59.496 --> 00:20:01.756
is commensurate with the takeover of Ireland and Britain

536
00:20:01.756 --> 00:20:03.676
by these Milesians.

537
00:20:03.676 --> 00:20:05.256
The Atenists who were ensconced,

538
00:20:05.256 --> 00:20:07.276
these Milesian, Atenists, Hyksos, Israelite,

539
00:20:07.276 --> 00:20:10.896
whatever you want to call them, the Judaics, the Tudors,

540
00:20:10.896 --> 00:20:13.676
there's a million names for them.

541
00:20:13.676 --> 00:20:16.476
These Egyptian Atenists, by the time that they had arrived

542
00:20:16.476 --> 00:20:18.976
in Ireland they were working on the destruction

543
00:20:18.976 --> 00:20:20.876
of the Druidic order,

544
00:20:20.876 --> 00:20:24.155
the destruction of that old megolithic way,

545
00:20:24.155 --> 00:20:25.756
which involves the mysteries of the earth

546
00:20:25.756 --> 00:20:27.356
and the mysteries of all sorts of things.

547
00:20:27.356 --> 00:20:29.116
And the cannibilization of their knowledge

548
00:20:29.116 --> 00:20:31.836
and their gnosis was going slowly I believe.

549
00:20:31.836 --> 00:20:33.796
I think they even had a lot of problems.

550
00:20:33.796 --> 00:20:37.776
So they called on their brothers in Rome

551
00:20:37.776 --> 00:20:39.876
to come and help as a mercenary action.

552
00:20:39.876 --> 00:20:40.896
They've done this multiple times,

553
00:20:40.896 --> 00:20:42.156
it's not the first time.

554
00:20:42.156 --> 00:20:43.756
In fact the whole Alexander the Great thing

555
00:20:43.756 --> 00:20:45.816
conquering, going back to Egypt

556
00:20:45.816 --> 00:20:48.675
out of Greece is actually a tentacle of what

557
00:20:48.675 --> 00:20:49.596
I'm also talking about.

558
00:20:49.596 --> 00:20:51.416
These are not as they are portrayed in history

559
00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:52.916
as we talked about earlier.

560
00:20:52.916 --> 00:20:56.695
They're different than the established reading of history.

561
00:20:56.695 --> 00:20:58.656
These were actually mercenary actions

562
00:20:58.656 --> 00:21:02.150
funded by this Atenist kaballah that I write about.

563
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:03.471
More specifically the Roman,

564
00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:05.610
what we call in history the Roman army coming

565
00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.779
to conquer Britain and the Gauls of France,

566
00:21:08.779 --> 00:21:11.268
Julius Caesar and all these Sadists coming out there.

567
00:21:11.268 --> 00:21:14.448
These were merely lackeys of the Atenist Pharonic guys

568
00:21:14.448 --> 00:21:16.928
who ruled over these people.

569
00:21:16.928 --> 00:21:18.648
History makes it look like these psychopaths

570
00:21:18.648 --> 00:21:21.748
did it of their own free will to empire build.

571
00:21:21.748 --> 00:21:23.228
No. Not true.

572
00:21:23.228 --> 00:21:25.368
So the destruction of the Druidic culture

573
00:21:25.368 --> 00:21:29.748
begins about 500 BC and continues for approximately

574
00:21:29.748 --> 00:21:32.356
1000 years which then brings us up

575
00:21:32.356 --> 00:21:34.327
to the creation of what I would consider

576
00:21:34.327 --> 00:21:38.648
the cannibalized, corrupted form of Druidism,

577
00:21:38.648 --> 00:21:40.587
which is, you know, to be blunt about it,

578
00:21:40.587 --> 00:21:42.287
Judeo-Christianity.

579
00:21:42.287 --> 00:21:43.527
<v Voiceover>And along the way,</v>

580
00:21:43.527 --> 00:21:45.528
which is I think an important note,

581
00:21:45.528 --> 00:21:47.927
that the Great Library in Alexandria was burnt,

582
00:21:47.927 --> 00:21:49.587
slashed and burned, so all the knowledge

583
00:21:49.587 --> 00:21:51.087
from the past was lost there as well.

584
00:21:51.087 --> 00:21:52.248
<v ->Yeah. That's right.</v>

585
00:21:52.248 --> 00:21:54.348
<v Voiceover>And that was a result of the Roman empire.</v>

586
00:21:54.348 --> 00:21:55.447
<v ->Remember the mercenaries?</v>

587
00:21:55.447 --> 00:21:56.117
<v Voiceover>Yep.</v>

588
00:21:56.117 --> 00:21:58.496
<v ->These mercenaries were told where to go, what to do.</v>

589
00:21:58.496 --> 00:21:59.556
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

590
00:21:59.556 --> 00:22:01.437
<v ->No different than, they accept don't they</v>

591
00:22:01.437 --> 00:22:04.356
that Henry the eighth literally sent out

592
00:22:04.356 --> 00:22:05.757
the dissolution of the monastery?

593
00:22:05.757 --> 00:22:07.656
They can accept that because it's recent history,

594
00:22:07.656 --> 00:22:10.015
but when you say that in Caesar's time or

595
00:22:10.015 --> 00:22:11.475
Alexander's time it was deliberate,

596
00:22:11.475 --> 00:22:13.260
you know, you're crazy.

597
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.300
<v Voiceover>So it was deliberate.</v>

598
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.066
And so now we have stamped out the vestiges

599
00:22:17.066 --> 00:22:21.105
of the Druidic and the highly civilized cultures

600
00:22:21.105 --> 00:22:22.385
of that time.

601
00:22:22.385 --> 00:22:23.365
<v ->Yeah. Absolutely.</v>

602
00:22:23.365 --> 00:22:24.585
And then you're left with basically

603
00:22:24.585 --> 00:22:28.205
a complete monstrosity.

604
00:22:28.205 --> 00:22:29.586
A travesty.

605
00:22:29.586 --> 00:22:31.265
<v Voiceover>And there's really a huge component to this,</v>

606
00:22:31.265 --> 00:22:34.105
and this is what I want to get into with you now.

607
00:22:34.105 --> 00:22:36.505
And that is that the feminine essence,

608
00:22:36.505 --> 00:22:39.225
in essence is stamped out in terms of

609
00:22:39.225 --> 00:22:41.385
the wisdom and power of the feminine, the goddess,

610
00:22:41.385 --> 00:22:44.826
and so forth is gone by this point, right?

611
00:22:44.826 --> 00:22:45.926
<v ->Yeah.</v>

612
00:22:45.926 --> 00:22:46.966
<v Voiceover>And then we look now</v>

613
00:22:46.966 --> 00:22:48.945
what we have as a society and we can,

614
00:22:48.945 --> 00:22:51.726
I think we can certainly see the effects of

615
00:22:51.726 --> 00:22:55.565
having removed the feminine aspect of the wisdom

616
00:22:55.565 --> 00:22:57.225
in the triad from the equation.

617
00:22:57.225 --> 00:22:58.825
You get what you have now.

618
00:22:58.825 --> 00:23:02.386
And all of these essentially,

619
00:23:02.386 --> 00:23:05.425
the concepts are almost purely masculine

620
00:23:05.425 --> 00:23:06.665
what we're looking at today.

621
00:23:06.665 --> 00:23:08.366
<v ->Hierarchical, masculine, patristic.</v>

622
00:23:08.366 --> 00:23:11.346
<v Voiceover>Exactly. So, here we are.</v>

623
00:23:11.346 --> 00:23:13.365
We've kind of followed this train of thought a little bit

624
00:23:13.365 --> 00:23:15.086
and to see the rest of it I highly recommend

625
00:23:15.086 --> 00:23:17.265
everybody read these books.

626
00:23:17.265 --> 00:23:19.166
I think it's important to string it all together,

627
00:23:19.166 --> 00:23:21.445
but we don't have time to string the whole thing together.

628
00:23:21.445 --> 00:23:23.926
Let's say, here we are now.

629
00:23:23.926 --> 00:23:25.226
We're seeing the effects of it.

630
00:23:25.226 --> 00:23:27.066
We've seen that society has been ravaged

631
00:23:27.066 --> 00:23:30.405
and we're turning into automatons under this.

632
00:23:30.405 --> 00:23:33.465
What is it, what do you see is reemerging?

633
00:23:33.465 --> 00:23:34.905
And what is it going to take?

634
00:23:34.905 --> 00:23:36.906
And how important is the feminine essence

635
00:23:36.906 --> 00:23:39.465
in terms of being injected back into all of this

636
00:23:39.465 --> 00:23:41.065
to recover ourselves?

637
00:23:41.065 --> 00:23:42.885
<v ->Well I'm glad that you use the term feminine</v>

638
00:23:42.885 --> 00:23:45.565
rather than the word female because what we're talking about

639
00:23:45.565 --> 00:23:48.886
here is expressions of thought, not gender.

640
00:23:48.886 --> 00:23:51.705
And of course the Druidic concept

641
00:23:51.705 --> 00:23:54.185
was entirely matriarchal, that has to be understood.

642
00:23:54.185 --> 00:23:56.466
In fact right up even through the Scythian era,

643
00:23:56.466 --> 00:23:58.025
it was the same, you know.

644
00:23:58.025 --> 00:24:02.825
And one of the other functions of the Druids, by the way,

645
00:24:02.825 --> 00:24:04.985
they were called the servants or keepers of truth.

646
00:24:04.985 --> 00:24:06.685
The secondary function of the Druids

647
00:24:06.685 --> 00:24:09.465
was the healing of the earth in a very profound way.

648
00:24:09.465 --> 00:24:12.085
So when we think of Druids,

649
00:24:12.085 --> 00:24:14.325
we see the Stonehenge portals

650
00:24:14.325 --> 00:24:15.965
which looks like the doorway, the gateway.

651
00:24:15.965 --> 00:24:18.140
We see the megaliths aligned to the constellations.

652
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.450
This is because the Druids were very, very conscious

653
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.090
that their goddess, their Ari, Rhea,

654
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:25.430
whatever you want to call her, Demeter.

655
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:28.290
Their goddess was damaged.

656
00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:30.551
They didn't think of the earth today as we do

657
00:24:30.551 --> 00:24:32.471
as some thing out there, you know,

658
00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:36.330
that could be controlled and probed and raped and looted.

659
00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:39.310
They saw it as a living entity that had been scarred

660
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:42.810
by these cataclysms that they understood had taken place.

661
00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:45.590
And therefore the mound building had many functions.

662
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:47.970
It was to help to galvanize the community.

663
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:50.270
It was also like you see in Egypt,

664
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.450
you know with some of the very tall towers

665
00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:52.710
and even the pyramid itself

666
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:54.271
so that if it was ever to happen again,

667
00:24:54.271 --> 00:24:56.770
documents and icons and relics could be saved,

668
00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.590
because the doors are above the water line.

669
00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:00.530
So there's practical aspects, there's ritual aspects,

670
00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.111
there was social aspects.

671
00:25:02.111 --> 00:25:04.290
The picking up of very small rocks to bring them,

672
00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:06.650
like at Medb's cairn in Ireland and Carrowkeel

673
00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:07.710
and so many of these others

674
00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.510
and people marvel at how it was done.

675
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:12.270
That galvanized the community ritually.

676
00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:14.450
And in those days, you'll often see the concept

677
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:16.551
of the Egyptian pillar that's lying flat,

678
00:25:16.551 --> 00:25:18.070
and then they erect it.

679
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.571
You know, it's called the djed pillar.

680
00:25:19.571 --> 00:25:21.970
That was again a ritual that was very ceremonial.

681
00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.870
It was done very precisely at certain times of the year

682
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.071
and the ceremony was about reerecting

683
00:25:27.071 --> 00:25:28.550
that which had fallen.

684
00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.270
The pole had shifted, there was a chaos,

685
00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:31.271
there was a cataclysm,

686
00:25:31.271 --> 00:25:33.291
and the raising of the pillar or the obelisk

687
00:25:33.291 --> 00:25:36.110
was a sign that order is restored again.

688
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:37.111
You know, the Masons and all these people

689
00:25:37.111 --> 00:25:40.291
have co-opted this of course for their own purposes.

690
00:25:40.291 --> 00:25:42.090
But the fundamental principle was that

691
00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:44.550
Mother Earth has been damaged, right?

692
00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.610
And because Mother Earth has been damaged,

693
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:50.111
the psyche of man has been damaged.

694
00:25:50.111 --> 00:25:51.770
So then you might also say then

695
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.951
that the third function of the teacher, the elder,

696
00:25:53.951 --> 00:25:58.581
the Arya, to deal with man's fragmented consciousness.

697
00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:00.331
There's a relationship between consciousness

698
00:26:00.331 --> 00:26:01.631
and matter, you see.

699
00:26:01.631 --> 00:26:04.030
So anyone today just like a medic

700
00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:08.971
or a paramedic will deal with the victim of a car wreck.

701
00:26:08.971 --> 00:26:11.990
The Druids were people who not only realized that

702
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.610
they now have an incredible responsibility

703
00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:16.770
to not only heal their earth geomantically,

704
00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:18.950
but take on this fragmented creature,

705
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.105
who was completely out of his tree.

706
00:26:22.105 --> 00:26:24.666
Like we said, consciousness shattered into multiple parts.

707
00:26:26.966 --> 00:26:29.666
In my work I've established that the ego,

708
00:26:29.666 --> 00:26:31.485
that which we know as the ego,

709
00:26:31.485 --> 00:26:33.226
is basically the ghost that arose

710
00:26:33.226 --> 00:26:35.105
from the grave of the self.

711
00:26:35.105 --> 00:26:37.375
These subsequent traumas that we talked about

712
00:26:37.375 --> 00:26:41.706
have so fragmented man's mind in recent times

713
00:26:41.706 --> 00:26:45.245
that what left, what was left of that circuit board,

714
00:26:45.245 --> 00:26:47.345
that still had a little beeping action,

715
00:26:47.345 --> 00:26:50.085
I describe it as sort of the door man

716
00:26:50.085 --> 00:26:51.445
in the great corporation.

717
00:26:51.445 --> 00:26:52.885
There he is in his office, you know,

718
00:26:52.885 --> 00:26:56.565
in his blue suit with his torch groveling

719
00:26:56.565 --> 00:26:58.406
around in the dark at the bottom of the corporation.

720
00:26:58.406 --> 00:27:01.025
He's very officious, you know.

721
00:27:01.025 --> 00:27:02.096
He thinks of himself as the owner

722
00:27:02.096 --> 00:27:03.937
but we need him to kind of thing.

723
00:27:03.937 --> 00:27:07.457
He's keeping the lights on, he's cleaning the floors,

724
00:27:07.457 --> 00:27:09.137
and making sure everything is working.

725
00:27:09.137 --> 00:27:10.177
That's the ego.

726
00:27:10.177 --> 00:27:13.210
That is basically the ghost that arose from

727
00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:14.690
the grave of the self.

728
00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:18.111
So the Druids, or any teacher, update this,

729
00:27:18.111 --> 00:27:20.830
fast forward again to any great master or

730
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.550
person who is working with these traditions

731
00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.831
are trying to heal.

732
00:27:23.831 --> 00:27:25.111
Mandalas for instance, you know,

733
00:27:25.111 --> 00:27:27.010
all forms of Jungian analysis,

734
00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:29.461
all of this is doing the same thing.

735
00:27:29.461 --> 00:27:32.141
The idea being that consciousness was fragmented

736
00:27:32.141 --> 00:27:35.220
and we are fragmented beings.

737
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.141
Coming back to the essence of your question though,

738
00:27:39.731 --> 00:27:43.556
because of the fragmentation, i.e. the trauma,

739
00:27:43.556 --> 00:27:46.215
we have now a problem between two paradigms

740
00:27:46.215 --> 00:27:48.255
that can be expressed in many, many ways.

741
00:27:48.255 --> 00:27:49.816
Ying and yang, prolific devouring,

742
00:27:49.816 --> 00:27:51.530
nagual, tonal.

743
00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:55.976
The best way I like to explain it is

744
00:27:55.976 --> 00:28:00.056
hierarchical and holarchic, or hierarchic and holarchic.

745
00:28:00.056 --> 00:28:01.452
And that's why I think that the pyramid turns up

746
00:28:01.452 --> 00:28:03.292
in so many corporations and on the dollar bill

747
00:28:03.292 --> 00:28:06.033
because that's the perfect symbol for hierarchy,

748
00:28:06.033 --> 00:28:09.582
meaning this aggressive, masculine, phallic

749
00:28:09.582 --> 00:28:13.491
ultimately psychopathic type of concept.

750
00:28:13.491 --> 00:28:17.031
It is the traumatized, sociopathic, demented psychopathic

751
00:28:17.031 --> 00:28:20.311
mind that perceives hierarchy.

752
00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:24.070
It cannot see holarchy even if you pointed out to it.

753
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:25.030
Alright, like we said earlier,

754
00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:26.029
it's a twilight zone situation.

755
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.889
<v Voiceover>It's a program.</v>

756
00:28:26.889 --> 00:28:29.289
<v ->It's a program. It keeps running.</v>

757
00:28:29.289 --> 00:28:30.909
The person who is not part of that,

758
00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:33.129
who is on that directional, who is understanding

759
00:28:33.129 --> 00:28:35.670
that he's a part of the world,

760
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:38.330
not apart from it, right.

761
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:41.109
Who understands that there's a perfect order

762
00:28:41.109 --> 00:28:42.710
from the biggest neutron star

763
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:44.589
down to the subatomic level

764
00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:46.350
who understands the miracle of the body no less,

765
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:47.430
you don't have to look further than your own body

766
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:49.509
for the miracle of that, the miracle of birth,

767
00:28:49.509 --> 00:28:51.889
the miracle of the eye, the cells,

768
00:28:51.889 --> 00:28:54.590
as Bruce Lipton has shown and incredible people

769
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.870
have worked on this concept.

770
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.409
What is all of this?

771
00:28:58.409 --> 00:29:00.530
This is the idea that you do not need to

772
00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.650
put earrings on the Mona Lisa.

773
00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:04.969
You do not need to perfect what is perfect.

774
00:29:04.969 --> 00:29:07.049
You do not need to fix what isn't broken.

775
00:29:07.049 --> 00:29:09.469
But unfortunately that is a non,

776
00:29:09.469 --> 00:29:11.910
that is a sane way of thinking

777
00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.910
and you have the unsane person who will never,

778
00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:16.489
ever in a million years, it's a feedback loop,

779
00:29:16.489 --> 00:29:18.740
they can't see it, they will not see it.

780
00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.609
They don't want to see it.

781
00:29:20.609 --> 00:29:22.418
And this kind of psychopathic creature,

782
00:29:22.418 --> 00:29:24.356
through these fraternities that exist today,

783
00:29:24.356 --> 00:29:27.056
do end up at the top of the power pyramid.

784
00:29:27.056 --> 00:29:29.317
The Masonic orders screen out the good men,

785
00:29:29.317 --> 00:29:30.656
it's the reverse, it's the inverse of what

786
00:29:30.656 --> 00:29:32.352
the Druids used to do.

787
00:29:32.352 --> 00:29:34.031
The scum rises to the top.

788
00:29:34.031 --> 00:29:35.412
And because these people are possessed.

789
00:29:35.412 --> 00:29:36.872
<v Voiceover>The more corrupt and controllable.</v>

790
00:29:36.872 --> 00:29:39.612
<v ->Yeah, and because these individuals are collectivists,</v>

791
00:29:39.612 --> 00:29:42.152
and I mean this in the full Ayn Rand sense,

792
00:29:42.152 --> 00:29:43.671
they are collectivists.

793
00:29:43.671 --> 00:29:45.372
They have no individual identity,

794
00:29:45.372 --> 00:29:47.032
they don't want one,

795
00:29:47.032 --> 00:29:49.352
except on a superficial level to give you the idea

796
00:29:49.352 --> 00:29:50.832
that they're all wonderful individuals.

797
00:29:50.832 --> 00:29:51.712
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

798
00:29:51.712 --> 00:29:54.312
<v ->They're not, they are extremely insecure people</v>

799
00:29:54.312 --> 00:29:56.489
who have a hive mentality.

800
00:29:56.489 --> 00:29:59.850
The architecture of the hierarchy works for them,

801
00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:01.310
going back full circle to the beginning of

802
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:02.850
what we started talking about.

803
00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:05.630
It's an architecture of control but not power.

804
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:07.290
They have control but they don't have power.

805
00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:08.950
Actually we have the power and until we wake up,

806
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:10.850
we're not going to realize this.

807
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:13.309
The holarchic model is a feminine model.

808
00:30:13.309 --> 00:30:17.170
It is a yin model, it doesn't exclude

809
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.890
the masculine principles but it brings it into balance.

810
00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:22.350
It merges with it. And we are seeing this now.

811
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:25.190
It's more receptive, it's more grassroots,

812
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:29.710
and it will not use hierarchical models to fix hierarchy.

813
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:31.685
You know, you're not using the same concepts,

814
00:30:31.685 --> 00:30:34.105
you're not coming at it quite the same way.

815
00:30:34.105 --> 00:30:37.366
And you're also, yourself not infected

816
00:30:37.366 --> 00:30:39.981
with this mental virus that came about

817
00:30:39.981 --> 00:30:42.700
as an extension of this fundamental trauma

818
00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.820
that happened in ancient times.

819
00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.300
<v Voiceover>It's holistic in nature.</v>

820
00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.756
<v ->Yeah. Absolutely. This is holistic in nature.</v>

821
00:30:49.756 --> 00:30:52.596
And do you see now that even in the quantum science,

822
00:30:52.596 --> 00:30:54.216
if you look back thirty years,

823
00:30:54.216 --> 00:30:55.857
you start to see how something's happening

824
00:30:55.857 --> 00:30:57.656
where these paradigms are being reintroduced?

825
00:30:57.656 --> 00:30:58.997
<v Voiceover>Yes. Very much so.</v>

826
00:30:58.997 --> 00:31:01.516
And the ancient arts that as you say

827
00:31:01.516 --> 00:31:04.497
were considered part of the original healing arts,

828
00:31:04.497 --> 00:31:06.656
such as feng shui and other things.

829
00:31:06.656 --> 00:31:08.496
<v ->Exactly and as reprehensible as it was</v>

830
00:31:08.496 --> 00:31:10.997
in its own way, this dabbling in the '60s,

831
00:31:10.997 --> 00:31:12.997
the guru thing, looking east.

832
00:31:14.097 --> 00:31:16.836
Let's not look at all the pitfalls of it,

833
00:31:16.836 --> 00:31:17.937
let's look at it broadly.

834
00:31:17.937 --> 00:31:19.796
That again is a search.

835
00:31:19.796 --> 00:31:22.237
In fact one could say even the rise of psychology.

836
00:31:22.237 --> 00:31:24.776
The rise of the countercultural movement.

837
00:31:24.776 --> 00:31:26.966
<v Voiceover>Trying to understand that division and pain.</v>

838
00:31:26.966 --> 00:31:28.397
<v ->I've always remarked in my world,</v>

839
00:31:28.397 --> 00:31:30.997
the rise of rock and roll and the paradigms of

840
00:31:30.997 --> 00:31:32.696
certain bands and certain music is again

841
00:31:32.696 --> 00:31:35.396
a seeking to find that wholeness.

842
00:31:35.396 --> 00:31:39.677
Again, people fall into pitfalls, they may get distracted.

843
00:31:41.417 --> 00:31:43.376
Again, lot of this is co-opted, again.

844
00:31:43.376 --> 00:31:44.856
Because the Big Brother is very sensitive

845
00:31:44.856 --> 00:31:46.836
to where humanity is going and it watches and watches

846
00:31:46.836 --> 00:31:49.196
and it puts in its infiltrators to corrupt certain things.

847
00:31:49.196 --> 00:31:49.937
<v Voiceover>Right in the middle of</v>

848
00:31:49.937 --> 00:31:50.834
the rock and roll industry.

849
00:31:50.834 --> 00:31:52.302
<v ->Exactly. Country and western and all of that,</v>

850
00:31:52.302 --> 00:31:54.843
we know that, we're onto this.

851
00:31:54.843 --> 00:31:56.523
But in the movies, in the films.

852
00:31:56.523 --> 00:31:57.863
So the answer to your question is,

853
00:31:57.863 --> 00:32:00.822
if we start using those, let's call it, let's say,

854
00:32:00.822 --> 00:32:05.532
holarchic models in film, in radio, in communication.

855
00:32:05.532 --> 00:32:07.201
If we start using the feminine model again

856
00:32:07.201 --> 00:32:08.921
in our writing, you know.

857
00:32:08.921 --> 00:32:11.561
There's many ways that this can be approached.

858
00:32:12.431 --> 00:32:14.410
This will be a harkening back to the root

859
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.890
of what went wrong, to try and heal the trauma.

860
00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.209
But again I'm not saying there's only one way.

861
00:32:20.209 --> 00:32:21.749
I'm open to all possibilities.

862
00:32:21.749 --> 00:32:24.829
There's lots of possibilities to bring about that healing.

863
00:32:24.829 --> 00:32:26.297
<v Voiceover>In fact you're optimistic.</v>

864
00:32:26.297 --> 00:32:27.897
Some people would hear your work and say,

865
00:32:27.897 --> 00:32:30.276
"Oh my gosh, if I weren't scared before, I am now,"

866
00:32:30.276 --> 00:32:31.437
"because now I see the problem."

867
00:32:31.437 --> 00:32:33.716
But in reality you are an optimist

868
00:32:33.716 --> 00:32:35.697
and you're seeing the opportunity in cultures

869
00:32:35.697 --> 00:32:37.396
such as the American culture

870
00:32:37.396 --> 00:32:40.716
that is certainly number one in line for

871
00:32:40.716 --> 00:32:42.777
being a victim, I don't like the word victim,

872
00:32:42.777 --> 00:32:46.317
but a victim of the architects of control,

873
00:32:46.317 --> 00:32:49.736
perhaps above all else because of what does come out

874
00:32:49.736 --> 00:32:51.097
of this region of the world.

875
00:32:51.097 --> 00:32:52.797
What do you see as the possibility

876
00:32:52.797 --> 00:32:53.816
within that as well?

877
00:32:53.816 --> 00:32:55.796
<v ->Well I'd like to address that very briefly.</v>

878
00:32:55.796 --> 00:32:56.856
Being from Europe and all,

879
00:32:56.856 --> 00:32:58.776
I keep hearing, "Oh they've Americanized this,"

880
00:32:58.776 --> 00:33:00.796
"they've Americanized that," you know.

881
00:33:00.796 --> 00:33:01.797
And I always stop people and go,

882
00:33:01.797 --> 00:33:03.157
"No, no, no, no, no."

883
00:33:03.157 --> 00:33:04.396
"This is not coming out of America,"

884
00:33:04.396 --> 00:33:05.536
"America's the first victim of"

885
00:33:05.536 --> 00:33:08.076
"the corporatization of the world."

886
00:33:08.076 --> 00:33:09.816
We're talking Blade Runner here, right.

887
00:33:09.816 --> 00:33:10.877
<v Voiceover>Truly. Yeah.</v>

888
00:33:10.877 --> 00:33:12.816
This is a worldwide global corporate structure

889
00:33:12.816 --> 00:33:16.556
that is an infection that America has just fallen first.

890
00:33:16.556 --> 00:33:18.076
<v Voiceover>Well we obviously must have been</v>

891
00:33:18.076 --> 00:33:20.476
a desirable market to take.

892
00:33:20.476 --> 00:33:23.014
And also a vulnerable market to take.

893
00:33:23.014 --> 00:33:25.114
But how do you look at that?

894
00:33:25.114 --> 00:33:26.614
<v ->Oh, I couldn't agree more and this comes out of</v>

895
00:33:26.614 --> 00:33:29.495
my article on the Constitution con

896
00:33:29.495 --> 00:33:30.814
about how the Federalists from day one

897
00:33:30.814 --> 00:33:33.154
were absolutely making sure

898
00:33:33.154 --> 00:33:36.334
that they'd subvert the Articles of Confederation

899
00:33:36.334 --> 00:33:38.554
and some of the other ideas, you know,

900
00:33:38.554 --> 00:33:40.014
that would have brought the states together

901
00:33:40.014 --> 00:33:42.394
and had a little bit more of an egalitarian system here.

902
00:33:42.394 --> 00:33:44.054
That that was subverted from day one,

903
00:33:44.054 --> 00:33:45.694
even by those people that are still considered

904
00:33:45.694 --> 00:33:47.326
and taught in schools as Founding Fathers.

905
00:33:47.326 --> 00:33:49.665
There's an incredible story there,

906
00:33:49.665 --> 00:33:51.723
because the Tzar of Russia was watching,

907
00:33:51.723 --> 00:33:54.303
South America was watching, a lot of eyes.

908
00:33:54.303 --> 00:33:56.683
You know, people despised the royal system

909
00:33:56.683 --> 00:33:59.103
that was coming out of Britain and the old world.

910
00:33:59.103 --> 00:34:00.783
And unfortunately that crept in again later

911
00:34:00.783 --> 00:34:02.903
with the federal orbs that we know now still run

912
00:34:02.903 --> 00:34:04.863
out of the District of Columbia, the whole federal system,

913
00:34:04.863 --> 00:34:06.683
they're back.

914
00:34:06.683 --> 00:34:08.763
America is nothing more than a satellite of London.

915
00:34:08.763 --> 00:34:10.224
The Americans, the federal system.

916
00:34:10.224 --> 00:34:11.003
<v Voiceover>And yet there's something else.</v>

917
00:34:11.003 --> 00:34:12.524
There is something about America that makes it

918
00:34:12.524 --> 00:34:14.784
very desirable to take down and control.

919
00:34:14.784 --> 00:34:15.861
Because if you think about it,

920
00:34:15.861 --> 00:34:19.322
you've got supposedly all the loose nuts rolled west.

921
00:34:20.082 --> 00:34:22.689
Right, they say that within America, even the loose nuts,

922
00:34:22.689 --> 00:34:25.669
the fruit and nuts all rolled to California even.

923
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:27.269
But were you talking about fruit and nuts,

924
00:34:27.269 --> 00:34:28.389
you're talking about a very high degree

925
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:29.489
of creativity as well.

926
00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:30.369
<v ->Yeah. That's right.</v>

927
00:34:30.369 --> 00:34:32.049
<v Voiceover>You're talking about people who are rogues,</v>

928
00:34:32.049 --> 00:34:36.149
free agents, at least in the origins, right?

929
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:37.589
So what happens when you have all these free agents

930
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:39.289
that have run away from the other structures

931
00:34:39.289 --> 00:34:41.049
and now you control them?

932
00:34:41.049 --> 00:34:43.509
<v ->I think Buckminster Fuller addressed it when he said,</v>

933
00:34:43.509 --> 00:34:46.349
"Before you can replace an outmoded, corrupt system,"

934
00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:48.269
"you have to create something to replace it."

935
00:34:48.269 --> 00:34:50.670
I would subdivide that and say,

936
00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:54.369
if you see something rotten, dying, let it die.

937
00:34:54.369 --> 00:34:56.249
So before you can create something new,

938
00:34:56.249 --> 00:34:58.489
if there's something unjust, if there's something rotten

939
00:34:58.489 --> 00:35:01.049
and corrupt and it's fading away, let it.

940
00:35:01.049 --> 00:35:02.410
Let it.

941
00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:03.210
<v Voiceover>I agree.</v>

942
00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:05.030
<v ->A lot of the countercultural people want to hustle</v>

943
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:06.818
too quickly.

944
00:35:06.818 --> 00:35:07.578
What are you doing?

945
00:35:07.578 --> 00:35:09.117
You're trying to establish your Citadel as a freedom,

946
00:35:09.117 --> 00:35:11.917
truth and justice over the ruins of what was?

947
00:35:11.917 --> 00:35:14.198
Can you just wait until those get washed away first?

948
00:35:14.198 --> 00:35:15.398
Otherwise you know the pestilence

949
00:35:15.398 --> 00:35:16.997
of the rot might creep in.

950
00:35:16.997 --> 00:35:18.398
So they're coming from a good point of view,

951
00:35:18.398 --> 00:35:20.077
they're coming from a good understanding,

952
00:35:20.077 --> 00:35:22.937
they're coming from very optimistic and passionate place,

953
00:35:22.937 --> 00:35:25.898
but they're negating a very simple principle of nature.

954
00:35:25.898 --> 00:35:28.157
There is a thing called the winter cycle.

955
00:35:28.157 --> 00:35:30.478
There's a time when you leave a field fallow.

956
00:35:30.478 --> 00:35:31.717
<v Voiceover>Where are we right now?</v>

957
00:35:31.717 --> 00:35:33.298
<v ->At that place. At that place.</v>

958
00:35:33.298 --> 00:35:35.197
We're in a catabolic cycle.

959
00:35:35.197 --> 00:35:37.747
We're in the Shivaic cycle.

960
00:35:37.747 --> 00:35:39.245
And there's nothing wrong with that.

961
00:35:39.245 --> 00:35:41.305
Any holistic doctor knows you're going to have to

962
00:35:41.305 --> 00:35:43.946
go through that purging period before the immunity rises.

963
00:35:43.946 --> 00:35:45.025
<v Voiceover>All of the cells in the body</v>

964
00:35:45.025 --> 00:35:46.165
are constantly going through that.

965
00:35:46.165 --> 00:35:47.845
<v ->Exactly. So it's no different in society.</v>

966
00:35:47.845 --> 00:35:49.445
We're all cells of the body politic,

967
00:35:49.445 --> 00:35:51.606
we're all cells of the social hive,

968
00:35:51.606 --> 00:35:54.285
if you want to call it that.

969
00:35:54.285 --> 00:35:56.513
Always the great ideas will come from individual minds,

970
00:35:56.513 --> 00:35:57.513
I'm not saying that.

971
00:35:57.513 --> 00:36:00.213
But in a social setting, it's okay.

972
00:36:00.213 --> 00:36:03.474
The Mayans saw four whole civilizations come and go.

973
00:36:03.474 --> 00:36:06.393
Let's get real with this, you know. It happens.

974
00:36:06.393 --> 00:36:08.593
And it's okay, in my book I'm a very catabolic,

975
00:36:08.593 --> 00:36:11.233
I'm okay with deconstruction, always have been.

976
00:36:11.233 --> 00:36:13.633
This is why people think my work is dark and pessimistic

977
00:36:13.633 --> 00:36:15.293
and that's fine, they can think what they want.

978
00:36:15.293 --> 00:36:17.253
But it's a misreading of my work.

979
00:36:17.253 --> 00:36:18.853
It's because they have again not understood

980
00:36:18.853 --> 00:36:20.613
that there is this holistic cycle

981
00:36:20.613 --> 00:36:22.213
and it includes a purgation.

982
00:36:22.213 --> 00:36:24.053
Look at alchemy. There's the incineration.

983
00:36:24.053 --> 00:36:26.494
The purgation, the calcinatio, right,

984
00:36:26.494 --> 00:36:28.873
phase before you can have the rejuvenation.

985
00:36:28.873 --> 00:36:31.024
<v Voiceover>A deconstruction of letting go</v>

986
00:36:31.024 --> 00:36:32.953
of the structures that existed before

987
00:36:32.953 --> 00:36:35.234
and we're now entering the winter.

988
00:36:35.234 --> 00:36:39.314
What do you see as the opportunity there?

989
00:36:39.314 --> 00:36:41.754
<v ->Well I don't myself to tell you the honest truth</v>

990
00:36:41.754 --> 00:36:44.893
limit the possibilities by even thinking about them.

991
00:36:44.893 --> 00:36:46.993
I know that sounds crazy.

992
00:36:47.943 --> 00:36:50.673
At that point it's like Mr. Spock.

993
00:36:50.673 --> 00:36:55.191
Everything is possible, and there's all possibilities.

994
00:36:55.661 --> 00:36:58.977
And don't even violate that field of possibility

995
00:36:58.977 --> 00:37:01.378
by too much contemplation.

996
00:37:01.378 --> 00:37:03.557
At least I don't, you know, because I like to keep

997
00:37:03.557 --> 00:37:04.997
the field as open as possible.

998
00:37:04.997 --> 00:37:06.737
<v Voiceover>So it's a fresh canvas really</v>

999
00:37:06.737 --> 00:37:09.457
for our creation, for what we can recover for ourselves,

1000
00:37:09.457 --> 00:37:12.947
what we can remember, we can create again.

1001
00:37:12.947 --> 00:37:14.497
And you feel that we're going to do that?

1002
00:37:14.497 --> 00:37:17.077
How do you feel this race of consciousness is going?

1003
00:37:17.077 --> 00:37:21.817
<v ->A great deal of civilization is recreation.</v>

1004
00:37:21.817 --> 00:37:23.378
It's not really creation, it's recreation.

1005
00:37:23.378 --> 00:37:25.757
It's putting things together in a different way.

1006
00:37:25.757 --> 00:37:28.377
What happens is when the old structures fall,

1007
00:37:28.377 --> 00:37:31.077
there is a very insecure time for people

1008
00:37:31.077 --> 00:37:32.597
because they've grown so accustomed to that

1009
00:37:32.597 --> 00:37:33.918
through the conditioning we've talked about

1010
00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:37.097
and through just their simple own negation of self.

1011
00:37:37.097 --> 00:37:39.537
And because the self-murdered person is a slave.

1012
00:37:39.537 --> 00:37:41.807
He's already a person who is going to yield himself

1013
00:37:41.807 --> 00:37:43.617
to these forms of tyranny,

1014
00:37:43.617 --> 00:37:45.317
and in fact he might even be psychically

1015
00:37:45.317 --> 00:37:47.279
bringing that about.

1016
00:37:47.279 --> 00:37:49.478
Nine times out of ten in the alternative research,

1017
00:37:49.478 --> 00:37:53.638
quote on quote conspiracy movement,

1018
00:37:53.638 --> 00:37:54.818
most people are saying,

1019
00:37:54.818 --> 00:37:57.438
"What are those guys doing doing to us?"

1020
00:37:57.438 --> 00:37:58.698
What are these guys, you know,

1021
00:37:58.698 --> 00:37:59.798
up there on the other side of the hill

1022
00:37:59.798 --> 00:38:01.748
planning for us?

1023
00:38:01.748 --> 00:38:03.834
What have they got in store for us?

1024
00:38:03.834 --> 00:38:05.214
In my thinking it's about,

1025
00:38:05.214 --> 00:38:06.955
what have we done to create them?

1026
00:38:06.955 --> 00:38:07.774
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1027
00:38:07.774 --> 00:38:10.124
<v ->What's happening in the psyche</v>

1028
00:38:10.124 --> 00:38:12.014
that we have brought that into being?

1029
00:38:12.014 --> 00:38:14.054
Not the other way around.

1030
00:38:14.054 --> 00:38:15.654
<v Voiceover>Indeed I think that is</v>

1031
00:38:15.654 --> 00:38:17.794
the appropriate question, and even beyond that,

1032
00:38:17.794 --> 00:38:19.434
look at how much power we're giving to

1033
00:38:19.434 --> 00:38:21.394
the architects of control.

1034
00:38:21.394 --> 00:38:23.654
Certainly there has to be, that's not the final word

1035
00:38:23.654 --> 00:38:26.174
universally and interdimensionally.

1036
00:38:26.174 --> 00:38:27.814
There has to be something beyond that

1037
00:38:27.814 --> 00:38:30.434
by way of a much higher collective consciousness

1038
00:38:30.434 --> 00:38:31.155
that's occurring.

1039
00:38:31.155 --> 00:38:33.570
Maybe even cosmic collective consciousness.

1040
00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:35.830
How do you perceive that?

1041
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:39.810
<v ->From again what I've learned from the Druidic culture,</v>

1042
00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:43.501
why this is all happening is simply for man

1043
00:38:43.501 --> 00:38:46.281
to be perpetually okay with deconstruction.

1044
00:38:46.281 --> 00:38:47.261
That's his lesson.

1045
00:38:47.261 --> 00:38:50.321
You don't have to go into hypotheticals.

1046
00:38:50.321 --> 00:38:52.761
The very fact that he now needs to reunderstand

1047
00:38:52.761 --> 00:38:56.741
the Shiva, Shakti, Eros, Thanatos concept.

1048
00:38:56.741 --> 00:38:58.181
He's lost this, he's become inquisitive,

1049
00:38:58.181 --> 00:38:59.921
he's become yang, he's become aggressive.

1050
00:38:59.921 --> 00:39:01.681
Partly because as I said the people at the top

1051
00:39:01.681 --> 00:39:03.761
are themselves like that.

1052
00:39:03.761 --> 00:39:06.418
You see, the people who are this pathonogenic force,

1053
00:39:06.418 --> 00:39:09.966
who are this possessed or obsessed or psychopathic

1054
00:39:09.966 --> 00:39:11.427
or sadistic or whatever.

1055
00:39:11.427 --> 00:39:13.507
They don't like an organized world.

1056
00:39:13.507 --> 00:39:14.966
They talk a lot about order but actually they live

1057
00:39:14.966 --> 00:39:17.646
in internal disorder, right?

1058
00:39:17.646 --> 00:39:20.666
And they are deeply fragmented and traumatized

1059
00:39:20.666 --> 00:39:23.166
individuals, therefore they don't like order.

1060
00:39:23.166 --> 00:39:24.286
<v Voiceover>You mean natural order?</v>

1061
00:39:24.286 --> 00:39:26.206
Natural cycles and order?

1062
00:39:26.206 --> 00:39:28.266
<v ->Yeah, it goes back to this feminine principle</v>

1063
00:39:28.266 --> 00:39:29.066
as you're talking about.

1064
00:39:29.066 --> 00:39:30.186
There's flowing, mutable.

1065
00:39:30.186 --> 00:39:31.706
Remember the Hopi prophecy about letting go

1066
00:39:31.706 --> 00:39:34.286
of the ores, letting go of the banks, go with the flow,

1067
00:39:34.286 --> 00:39:36.406
that is lethal to those guys.

1068
00:39:36.406 --> 00:39:37.986
So that's why their into new world orders

1069
00:39:37.986 --> 00:39:40.166
and global villages, and surveillance societies,

1070
00:39:40.166 --> 00:39:43.396
and RFID chips and keeping you in line.

1071
00:39:43.396 --> 00:39:46.722
All of this stuff and one leash for one neck.

1072
00:39:46.722 --> 00:39:48.222
Their global villages, their pipe dream

1073
00:39:48.222 --> 00:39:50.323
is this masculine place in which everybody

1074
00:39:50.323 --> 00:39:52.622
is walking around like in the movie Equilibrium,

1075
00:39:52.622 --> 00:39:55.642
or various movies of beautifully, beautifully portrayed

1076
00:39:55.642 --> 00:39:58.222
this robotic creature going back even much further

1077
00:39:58.222 --> 00:39:59.882
movies have shown this.

1078
00:39:59.882 --> 00:40:04.682
Because they can not tolerate that level of spontaneity.

1079
00:40:05.442 --> 00:40:06.238
You see?

1080
00:40:06.238 --> 00:40:07.778
<v Voiceover>Yes. Because they can't control it.</v>

1081
00:40:07.778 --> 00:40:09.338
<v ->And also they are lethally, they're solar,</v>

1082
00:40:09.338 --> 00:40:11.038
remember, go back to Akhenaten,

1083
00:40:11.038 --> 00:40:12.538
they're solar worshippers, they don't like

1084
00:40:12.538 --> 00:40:14.078
the quote on quote darkness,

1085
00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:17.638
which in psychological terms again means sleep,

1086
00:40:17.638 --> 00:40:21.018
quiet, silence, mutability, right?

1087
00:40:21.018 --> 00:40:24.198
The endless possibility of exploration.

1088
00:40:24.198 --> 00:40:25.598
Looking deeply into something.

1089
00:40:25.598 --> 00:40:29.358
They want the super-lit, fluorescent-lit world,

1090
00:40:29.358 --> 00:40:31.079
and they're getting it, they built it.

1091
00:40:31.079 --> 00:40:32.198
<v Voiceover>But the collective consciousness</v>

1092
00:40:32.198 --> 00:40:33.798
is waking up to that other side

1093
00:40:33.798 --> 00:40:35.338
and doing this deep exploration,

1094
00:40:35.338 --> 00:40:37.238
whether they like it or not, it's happening.

1095
00:40:37.238 --> 00:40:38.939
I see it, you see it,

1096
00:40:38.939 --> 00:40:41.758
we are obviously in a position to see this every day

1097
00:40:41.758 --> 00:40:43.958
just by the input that comes from around the world

1098
00:40:43.958 --> 00:40:45.938
into these websites for example.

1099
00:40:45.938 --> 00:40:46.958
What do you think is going to happen

1100
00:40:46.958 --> 00:40:49.198
in this race for consciousness?

1101
00:40:49.198 --> 00:40:51.988
Control versus natural order?

1102
00:40:51.988 --> 00:40:54.654
<v ->It will be, you know the forces of,</v>

1103
00:40:54.654 --> 00:40:56.934
Blake said it in his poetry, Tennyson said it,

1104
00:40:56.934 --> 00:40:58.854
others have said it.

1105
00:40:58.854 --> 00:41:01.100
The forces of light and darkness are a braid,

1106
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.500
they're twined together.

1107
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.740
They're two sides of one coin.

1108
00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:07.760
So it's about how you balance all of these facets.

1109
00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.680
So man is growing up.

1110
00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:13.920
The good side is this ancient trauma is being healed,

1111
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:17.966
the next step to that is that he then grows up.

1112
00:41:17.966 --> 00:41:19.286
He learns how to balance the feminine,

1113
00:41:19.286 --> 00:41:22.306
I actually talked about this a lot in one of the DVDs I did

1114
00:41:22.306 --> 00:41:24.487
on the divination and the goddess,

1115
00:41:24.487 --> 00:41:26.666
where what is man's real function if it's not technology?

1116
00:41:26.666 --> 00:41:29.972
You know, we explored this concept.

1117
00:41:29.972 --> 00:41:32.892
Basically the human race has some evolving to do.

1118
00:41:32.892 --> 00:41:34.892
Remember, trauma as you said freezes the memory.

1119
00:41:34.892 --> 00:41:37.312
It creates an amnesia about the past,

1120
00:41:37.312 --> 00:41:39.872
it creates uncertainty towards the future.

1121
00:41:39.872 --> 00:41:41.492
As the healing happens,

1122
00:41:41.492 --> 00:41:44.912
you're a bit more coherent even from a historical

1123
00:41:44.912 --> 00:41:48.872
point of view and you're less anxious about the future.

1124
00:41:48.872 --> 00:41:49.932
<v Voiceover>And that's beginning.</v>

1125
00:41:49.932 --> 00:41:51.852
<v ->Right, Bo Gritz used to say,</v>

1126
00:41:51.852 --> 00:41:53.032
Colonel James Bo Gritz used to say

1127
00:41:53.032 --> 00:41:55.992
that when you heal one thing, the mega thing,

1128
00:41:55.992 --> 00:41:59.572
lots of other things automatically heal by themselves.

1129
00:41:59.572 --> 00:42:01.452
And I definitely believe that.

1130
00:42:01.452 --> 00:42:03.472
He and I may disagree about what is the main thing

1131
00:42:03.472 --> 00:42:05.872
to be healed, but the metaphor is absolutely brilliant.

1132
00:42:05.872 --> 00:42:08.312
That once you get back to the fundamentals,

1133
00:42:08.312 --> 00:42:09.872
you don't really have to go around and

1134
00:42:09.872 --> 00:42:11.292
micromanage all the other stuff.

1135
00:42:11.292 --> 00:42:14.515
It will automatically blossom, you know, in its own way.

1136
00:42:14.515 --> 00:42:15.399
<v Voiceover>Are you seeing that blossoming</v>

1137
00:42:15.399 --> 00:42:16.700
occurring now?

1138
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:17.579
<v ->Yeah, no.</v>

1139
00:42:17.579 --> 00:42:20.510
What's occurring now is the culling and the pruning.

1140
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:21.759
Right, the removal of the dead weight.

1141
00:42:21.759 --> 00:42:24.139
It's Shiva now. Shiva's in town.

1142
00:42:24.139 --> 00:42:25.138
And of course that will be threatening

1143
00:42:25.138 --> 00:42:26.158
for a lot of people.

1144
00:42:26.158 --> 00:42:27.438
But what can I do about it?

1145
00:42:27.438 --> 00:42:28.658
You can't stop the winter,

1146
00:42:28.658 --> 00:42:30.418
you know the old story about King Canute,

1147
00:42:30.418 --> 00:42:33.117
sitting in front of the ocean trying to stop the waves.

1148
00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:35.178
If people want to do that, it will make good comedy,

1149
00:42:35.178 --> 00:42:36.297
go ahead.

1150
00:42:36.297 --> 00:42:37.737
But I'd rather you spent the time

1151
00:42:37.737 --> 00:42:39.877
getting with this principle of deconstruction

1152
00:42:39.877 --> 00:42:41.058
because it's going to happen.

1153
00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:42.597
It's happening in your life, it's happening at work,

1154
00:42:42.597 --> 00:42:43.638
it's happening in your relationships.

1155
00:42:43.638 --> 00:42:45.977
It's unavoidable, so you either get with it,

1156
00:42:45.977 --> 00:42:49.277
or you fight against it and potentially drown in the river.

1157
00:42:50.157 --> 00:42:51.507
Because that flow is going on.

1158
00:42:51.507 --> 00:42:55.283
That to me is the essence of all yoga is balance.

1159
00:42:55.283 --> 00:42:57.013
It's the nagual and the tonal,

1160
00:42:57.013 --> 00:42:58.753
the prolific and the devouring,

1161
00:42:58.753 --> 00:43:00.474
it is this whole emergence so that

1162
00:43:00.474 --> 00:43:02.152
the extremes come together.

1163
00:43:02.152 --> 00:43:03.292
Maybe it even will be,

1164
00:43:03.292 --> 00:43:06.132
see remember hierarchy is not all together bad.

1165
00:43:06.132 --> 00:43:08.672
In certain areas of life you require the hierarchy.

1166
00:43:08.672 --> 00:43:10.332
Especially if you're trying to establish something.

1167
00:43:10.332 --> 00:43:12.252
But the hierarchies of the world brotherhood

1168
00:43:12.252 --> 00:43:14.652
have become only that, and you can see that

1169
00:43:14.652 --> 00:43:16.172
in their degree ceremonies and the fraternity

1170
00:43:16.172 --> 00:43:18.792
structure that they have, it becomes completely

1171
00:43:18.792 --> 00:43:23.292
a sort of accentuated or overly done.

1172
00:43:23.992 --> 00:43:26.961
And the holarchy might also have aspects

1173
00:43:26.961 --> 00:43:28.362
that are not so hot.

1174
00:43:28.362 --> 00:43:29.981
So again we have to look at that.

1175
00:43:29.981 --> 00:43:34.321
But the ultimate thing is we've swung so much to one side,

1176
00:43:34.321 --> 00:43:36.001
that potentially now we have the chance

1177
00:43:36.001 --> 00:43:38.121
to get back into balance, I think that's what's happening.

1178
00:43:38.121 --> 00:43:40.468
Man has had that chance many times.

1179
00:43:40.468 --> 00:43:42.766
If he resists it perpetually then the forces of nature

1180
00:43:42.766 --> 00:43:44.186
come in to do it for you.

1181
00:43:44.186 --> 00:43:48.266
So that's why there's a little bit more of a heat,

1182
00:43:48.266 --> 00:43:50.466
there's a little bit more of a--

1183
00:43:50.466 --> 00:43:51.986
<v Voiceover>There's an urgency. We can feel it.</v>

1184
00:43:51.986 --> 00:43:53.666
<v ->There's an urgency, I agree. That's the way to put it.</v>

1185
00:43:53.666 --> 00:43:54.706
There's a bit more urgency.

1186
00:43:54.706 --> 00:43:55.666
And that's fine by me, that can happen

1187
00:43:55.666 --> 00:43:57.046
in any modality of life.

1188
00:43:57.046 --> 00:43:59.146
Sometimes you need that Sergeant Major

1189
00:43:59.146 --> 00:44:03.546
to get you all into line, get you up and into uniform,

1190
00:44:03.546 --> 00:44:05.086
so to speak, so.

1191
00:44:05.086 --> 00:44:06.546
I've not a problem with that because

1192
00:44:06.546 --> 00:44:08.426
I come from that tradition, you know what I mean?

1193
00:44:08.426 --> 00:44:09.746
But I do understand where other people maybe

1194
00:44:09.746 --> 00:44:11.886
have a problem with that.

1195
00:44:11.886 --> 00:44:13.934
Secondary to that and extremely important though

1196
00:44:13.934 --> 00:44:17.393
is the continuing process of simple education.

1197
00:44:17.393 --> 00:44:21.433
Because they want you to be a media-drenched creature,

1198
00:44:21.433 --> 00:44:23.332
they want you to be a soundbyte person,

1199
00:44:23.332 --> 00:44:25.232
they don't want you to have a beginning,

1200
00:44:25.232 --> 00:44:27.772
middle and end to this, or a historical perspective.

1201
00:44:27.772 --> 00:44:28.792
<v Voiceover>And you get into this huge land</v>

1202
00:44:28.792 --> 00:44:30.292
of architects that control the DVD.

1203
00:44:30.292 --> 00:44:31.853
<v ->Yeah, big time.</v>

1204
00:44:31.853 --> 00:44:33.892
And the whole idea of the editing, you know,

1205
00:44:33.892 --> 00:44:35.912
and the fragmentation that takes place.

1206
00:44:35.912 --> 00:44:39.272
So what we do is we're very aware of the choir

1207
00:44:39.272 --> 00:44:40.414
that knows a bit about this

1208
00:44:40.414 --> 00:44:42.114
and the newcomers who maybe don't,

1209
00:44:42.114 --> 00:44:44.114
and the continuing process of education

1210
00:44:44.114 --> 00:44:48.094
because you cannot have transformation

1211
00:44:48.094 --> 00:44:50.094
until you first have the education.

1212
00:44:50.094 --> 00:44:52.094
And that's two-fold, must know about the problem,

1213
00:44:52.094 --> 00:44:54.173
must define the problem correctly,

1214
00:44:54.173 --> 00:44:56.274
in the same way that a holistic doctor has to define

1215
00:44:56.274 --> 00:44:57.874
what is wrong with you.

1216
00:44:57.874 --> 00:44:59.614
You know, there's no point looking at the eyes

1217
00:44:59.614 --> 00:45:01.644
when the problem is in the heart or whatever.

1218
00:45:01.644 --> 00:45:04.804
So find out where the real problems are,

1219
00:45:04.804 --> 00:45:07.450
diagnose it correctly, and then apply the right salve.

1220
00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:08.965
So this is what's going on.

1221
00:45:08.965 --> 00:45:10.166
And again, it's not one thread,

1222
00:45:10.166 --> 00:45:11.786
not one person has the answer.

1223
00:45:11.786 --> 00:45:13.086
There's people who want to territorialize

1224
00:45:13.086 --> 00:45:14.326
this kind of knowledge now,

1225
00:45:14.326 --> 00:45:15.766
especially fundamental types who think

1226
00:45:15.766 --> 00:45:18.086
that they suddenly, they own it or something,

1227
00:45:18.086 --> 00:45:19.745
they own this knowledge.

1228
00:45:19.745 --> 00:45:21.926
They can't understand that there's many tents.

1229
00:45:21.926 --> 00:45:23.106
<v Voiceover>It's organic, it's springing up</v>

1230
00:45:23.106 --> 00:45:24.306
from every source.

1231
00:45:24.306 --> 00:45:26.426
<v ->Exactly and I describe it often as having many</v>

1232
00:45:26.426 --> 00:45:28.646
encampments or tents on the field of battle.

1233
00:45:28.646 --> 00:45:29.646
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1234
00:45:29.646 --> 00:45:32.165
<v ->And we all have our banners and we all respect that.</v>

1235
00:45:32.165 --> 00:45:33.726
But we don't need to be fighting amongst ourselves

1236
00:45:33.726 --> 00:45:35.186
when we've got a common enemy.

1237
00:45:35.186 --> 00:45:37.046
And I've really very little tolerance for people

1238
00:45:37.046 --> 00:45:38.865
who come into this alternative movement

1239
00:45:38.865 --> 00:45:41.346
who come in with that bigotry,

1240
00:45:41.346 --> 00:45:42.806
because there's no place here.

1241
00:45:42.806 --> 00:45:44.405
And in fact you might even be part of the problem

1242
00:45:44.405 --> 00:45:45.986
at that point, you see.

1243
00:45:45.986 --> 00:45:48.506
And in fact, you might be put there.

1244
00:45:48.506 --> 00:45:51.925
There's a lot of these individuals are financed

1245
00:45:51.925 --> 00:45:53.686
to precisely act as agent provocateurs

1246
00:45:53.686 --> 00:45:55.806
and fifth columnists to destroy any kind of flow, you see.

1247
00:45:55.806 --> 00:45:56.966
<v Voiceover>Absolutely. Lots of that.</v>

1248
00:45:56.966 --> 00:45:58.436
<v ->So we have questions about that as well.</v>

1249
00:45:58.436 --> 00:46:00.891
But ultimately, as I said earlier on,

1250
00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:05.092
evil contains within it, the seeds of its own destruction.

1251
00:46:05.092 --> 00:46:09.612
So its ending will be a very magical thing.

1252
00:46:09.612 --> 00:46:12.512
You don't take it on by using the tools and weapons

1253
00:46:12.512 --> 00:46:14.372
it provides.

1254
00:46:14.372 --> 00:46:16.092
And that includes politics.

1255
00:46:16.092 --> 00:46:19.552
In order to destroy Big Brother or this Orwellian creature,

1256
00:46:20.512 --> 00:46:23.468
probably wouldn't want to try doing that with the weapons

1257
00:46:23.468 --> 00:46:26.783
it's created for you to do it.

1258
00:46:26.783 --> 00:46:28.603
<v Voiceover>What do we do it with?</v>

1259
00:46:28.603 --> 00:46:30.942
<v ->Well you do it by strengthening your knowledge,</v>

1260
00:46:30.942 --> 00:46:33.722
immunity, in that sense, intellectual immunity,

1261
00:46:33.722 --> 00:46:36.042
moral immunity, spiritual immunity of course.

1262
00:46:36.042 --> 00:46:37.882
All of the above if possible.

1263
00:46:37.882 --> 00:46:40.782
So that you are so strong that no matter what they do,

1264
00:46:40.782 --> 00:46:42.163
they can't defeat you.

1265
00:46:42.163 --> 00:46:43.363
At that point you've won,

1266
00:46:43.363 --> 00:46:45.102
it's a principle I've learned from Bruce Lee

1267
00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:48.083
from Krishnamurthy, you know, from studying martial arts,

1268
00:46:48.083 --> 00:46:50.323
from holistic therapy.

1269
00:46:50.323 --> 00:46:51.763
When you are so strong that your enemy

1270
00:46:51.763 --> 00:46:54.163
cannot destroy you, you have won.

1271
00:46:54.163 --> 00:46:57.753
It's jeet kune do, it's akito.

1272
00:46:57.753 --> 00:46:59.182
<v Voiceover>That was also part of</v>

1273
00:46:59.182 --> 00:47:00.822
the ancient Druidic civilization.

1274
00:47:00.822 --> 00:47:05.691
<v ->Precisely, it was. It was an absolute key part of that.</v>

1275
00:47:05.691 --> 00:47:08.849
<v Voiceover>So in summary,</v>

1276
00:47:08.849 --> 00:47:13.297
what do you see, I mean I don't want you to have to

1277
00:47:13.297 --> 00:47:17.457
go do a psychic journey into the future,

1278
00:47:17.457 --> 00:47:18.596
but what do you see?

1279
00:47:18.596 --> 00:47:20.557
The people say we're in a race against the clock

1280
00:47:20.557 --> 00:47:22.296
so to speak, to wake up,

1281
00:47:22.296 --> 00:47:25.497
versus to be in a hypnogogic state where we can be

1282
00:47:25.497 --> 00:47:27.256
completely controlled.

1283
00:47:27.256 --> 00:47:29.096
What do you see?

1284
00:47:29.096 --> 00:47:31.376
<v ->Well I see that again that it will be a dance.</v>

1285
00:47:31.376 --> 00:47:33.595
As the awakening process continues,

1286
00:47:33.595 --> 00:47:36.695
the injectors of the lie are going to amp that up,

1287
00:47:36.695 --> 00:47:39.715
and step that up, and it will be a race to the finish.

1288
00:47:39.715 --> 00:47:42.655
What I do see is that if, and this is basically

1289
00:47:42.655 --> 00:47:44.496
the raison d'etre of my work,

1290
00:47:44.496 --> 00:47:46.336
if you keep leaving consciousness at the door,

1291
00:47:46.336 --> 00:47:47.455
and I mean those who think they're doing

1292
00:47:47.455 --> 00:47:48.735
some positive work here,

1293
00:47:48.735 --> 00:47:52.035
if you perpetually keep leaving consciousness at the door,

1294
00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:54.736
then I would have some problems with the future.

1295
00:47:54.736 --> 00:47:58.536
And this is unfortunately being done.

1296
00:47:59.756 --> 00:48:02.774
As I said, the ultimate war is a war on the psyche.

1297
00:48:02.774 --> 00:48:05.714
Co-opting the trauma, adding more,

1298
00:48:05.714 --> 00:48:07.373
co-opting the fact that man is disabled

1299
00:48:07.373 --> 00:48:09.713
and firm, fragmented, psychotic, right?

1300
00:48:09.713 --> 00:48:13.773
Sadistic, self-sadistic, needing approval, all of the above.

1301
00:48:13.773 --> 00:48:17.933
If you have this kind of fragmented weak and firm mind,

1302
00:48:17.933 --> 00:48:20.993
and this war is targeted on this,

1303
00:48:20.993 --> 00:48:22.574
and this includes the vaccinations

1304
00:48:22.574 --> 00:48:24.034
and the addictive substances

1305
00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:25.574
and the psychotropics, all of it,

1306
00:48:25.574 --> 00:48:27.694
the mind control in the media, you name it.

1307
00:48:27.694 --> 00:48:29.693
It's a war on consciousness.

1308
00:48:29.693 --> 00:48:32.354
If the movement towards truth, freedom, and justice

1309
00:48:32.354 --> 00:48:34.873
can take that on board and get back to this understanding

1310
00:48:34.873 --> 00:48:37.353
of don't leave consciousness at the door,

1311
00:48:37.353 --> 00:48:38.813
understand that it's a war on consciousness,

1312
00:48:38.813 --> 00:48:42.174
then I think there will be some positive evolution

1313
00:48:42.174 --> 00:48:44.634
in this journey.

1314
00:48:44.634 --> 00:48:46.033
<v Voiceover>In the end, you're an optimist.</v>

1315
00:48:46.033 --> 00:48:48.813
<v ->I am an optimist, yeah. Absolutely, you know.</v>

1316
00:48:48.813 --> 00:48:51.013
As they say you can be a pessimist about tomorrow

1317
00:48:51.013 --> 00:48:53.373
but you can be an optimist about the day after tomorrow.

1318
00:48:53.373 --> 00:48:54.954
<v Voiceover>(laughs) Perfectly put.</v>

1319
00:48:54.954 --> 00:48:56.514
Michael, thank you so much for your time.

1320
00:48:56.514 --> 00:48:57.553
<v ->You're most welcome.</v>

1321
00:48:57.553 --> 00:48:58.572
<v Voiceover>I waited three years to get together</v>

1322
00:48:58.572 --> 00:49:01.674
with you in the flesh and it's been a total delight.

1323
00:49:01.674 --> 00:49:03.395
You have a lovely energy.

1324
00:49:03.395 --> 00:49:05.035
<v ->Thank you, it was my pleasure.</v>

1325
00:49:05.035 --> 00:49:07.135
<v ->For a much deeper look into the Irish origins</v>

1326
00:49:07.135 --> 00:49:09.675
of civilization, you can go to Michael's website

1328
00:49:11.635 --> 00:49:14.085
