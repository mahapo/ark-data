00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.650
<v ->Get your notepad out for this one.</v>

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.170
Naturopathic Doctor Edward Group the Third

3
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.130
has been studying natural health practices

4
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.390
for over 20 years, and in this interview

5
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.450
he gives you a prescription for how to take care

6
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.350
of your immune system by taking care of your guts.

7
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.210
He holds nothing back in telling us

8
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.970
the source of our health issues,

9
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.290
including the overload of toxins in our diets.

10
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.970
So you may not want to view this

11
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.830
while you're drinking your morning mocha.

12
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.910
Among the golden nuggets of information

13
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.890
is that many of the colon cleansers

14
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.650
on the health food store shelves

15
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.140
can actually create more problems for your colon.

16
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.350
That's the most devastating problem

17
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.930
for mankind right now, is toxicity,

18
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.450
and you're becoming a guru in this area

19
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.097
if you don't mind my--I'm not trying to embarrass you,

20
00:00:50.097 --> 00:00:52.104
but you're just a font of information.

21
00:00:52.104 --> 00:00:54.764
Talk about where we are finding ourselves right now

22
00:00:54.764 --> 00:00:56.994
and how we've gotten ourselves into this condition.

23
00:00:58.024 --> 00:00:59.764
<v ->Well, we find ourselves right now</v>

24
00:00:59.764 --> 00:01:02.304
in toxic overload, is what we find ourselves from.

25
00:01:02.774 --> 00:01:04.631
It starts from the air that we breathe,

26
00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.111
it starts from the food that we eat,

27
00:01:06.111 --> 00:01:07.931
the water that we drink, the beverages,

28
00:01:07.931 --> 00:01:09.651
the everything that we're exposed to

29
00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:12.091
in the external and internal environment.

30
00:01:12.518 --> 00:01:15.198
How that's affecting the body is it's just accumulating

31
00:01:15.198 --> 00:01:18.695
all those toxins around the cells, and it's causing

32
00:01:18.698 --> 00:01:21.812
the cells to not be able to communicate with each other,

33
00:01:21.812 --> 00:01:23.612
or to receive the proper messages.

34
00:01:23.612 --> 00:01:26.432
If the cells are receiving healthy messages,

35
00:01:26.432 --> 00:01:27.612
then we have a healthy body.

36
00:01:27.612 --> 00:01:30.092
If the cells are receiving toxic, bad messages

37
00:01:30.092 --> 00:01:32.752
then we have disease manifest in the body.

38
00:01:33.246 --> 00:01:36.006
Right now one out of every two people in the world

39
00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:37.813
is suffering from some form of disease.

40
00:01:37.813 --> 00:01:41.873
Probably everybody, if you look at pain here or there or...

41
00:01:42.947 --> 00:01:44.607
Well, I can guarantee this, most people

42
00:01:44.607 --> 00:01:47.637
are suffering from constipation and the whole purpose of

43
00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:50.707
what I want to get out to everybody is that

44
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.936
what the pharmaceutical companies

45
00:01:53.936 --> 00:01:57.906
have suppressed all this time

46
00:01:58.116 --> 00:02:01.016
and what they have not taught doctors all this time,

47
00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:04.927
is what the majority of my seminar was today,

48
00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:07.836
is everything goes back to simplicity.

49
00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:09.936
What is it that they're not teaching?

50
00:02:09.936 --> 00:02:11.796
What is it that I just uncovered?

51
00:02:11.796 --> 00:02:13.177
Which I didn't really uncover it,

52
00:02:13.177 --> 00:02:14.957
it was there all along, just no attention

53
00:02:14.957 --> 00:02:17.677
was paid to it, was the intestines.

54
00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:22.476
That's the missing link doctors are not talking--

55
00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:24.606
you can talk to your doctor and ask them,

56
00:02:24.916 --> 00:02:26.174
what can you tell me--you can go up

57
00:02:26.174 --> 00:02:27.754
to any doctor pretty much right now

58
00:02:27.754 --> 00:02:29.194
and say, "Doctor, what can you tell me

59
00:02:29.194 --> 00:02:30.734
"about my intestines, and what can you tell me

60
00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:33.474
"about my colon?" and they'll say,

61
00:02:33.474 --> 00:02:35.814
"Well I know according to the medical texts you're supposed

62
00:02:35.814 --> 00:02:37.994
"to have one bowel movement a week."

63
00:02:37.994 --> 00:02:39.054
<v Regina>(laughs)</v>

64
00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:41.304
Well, at least one a week, okay.

65
00:02:41.454 --> 00:02:43.194
That's a low baseline there.

66
00:02:43.194 --> 00:02:44.334
<v Edward>That's a very low</v>
<v Regina>Don't have to go</v>

67
00:02:44.334 --> 00:02:46.112
much to get over that bar.
<v Edward>baseline.</v>

68
00:02:46.112 --> 00:02:48.812
<v ->So getting back to the toxins, the whole point is,</v>

69
00:02:48.812 --> 00:02:51.832
if you're taking in 200,000 toxins a day through the air

70
00:02:51.832 --> 00:02:53.912
that you breathe in, some people might say,

71
00:02:53.912 --> 00:02:55.832
"Well how are toxins getting into my intestines

72
00:02:55.832 --> 00:02:58.332
"from air?" Well, you have to remember

73
00:02:58.332 --> 00:03:01.224
that your nose is lined with mucus membranes,

74
00:03:01.224 --> 00:03:02.924
your throat's lined with mucus membranes.

75
00:03:02.924 --> 00:03:05.044
That's why you have mucus, to catch those toxins

76
00:03:05.044 --> 00:03:07.404
before they actually get to your lungs,

77
00:03:07.404 --> 00:03:09.464
although you do have a percentage that get

78
00:03:09.464 --> 00:03:12.334
to your lung and go straight into your bloodstream.

79
00:03:12.704 --> 00:03:14.634
The number one...

80
00:03:14.864 --> 00:03:16.243
And the pharmaceutical companies know this,

81
00:03:16.243 --> 00:03:19.114
the number one point of attack

82
00:03:19.264 --> 00:03:20.283
is the intestines.

83
00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:22.184
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v Edward>Everything</v>

84
00:03:22.184 --> 00:03:24.664
comes through your mouth.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

85
00:03:24.664 --> 00:03:27.664
<v ->So regardless, if you're taking prescription medications,</v>

86
00:03:27.664 --> 00:03:29.624
if you're taking the air, the toxins--

87
00:03:29.624 --> 00:03:31.844
you have 200,000 toxins coming through air,

88
00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:33.164
200,000 coming through water,

89
00:03:33.164 --> 00:03:34.524
200,000 coming through beverages,

90
00:03:34.524 --> 00:03:36.424
200,000 coming through microbes,

91
00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:38.394
which everybody is infested with.

92
00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:40.904
200,000 coming through, you know,

93
00:03:40.904 --> 00:03:44.484
any different mean of toxic buildup

94
00:03:44.484 --> 00:03:46.544
coming into the body, and then let alone

95
00:03:46.544 --> 00:03:47.844
on top of that you have the toxins

96
00:03:47.844 --> 00:03:51.286
that your own body produces through stress,

97
00:03:51.286 --> 00:03:54.564
emotional distress, all leading to

98
00:03:54.564 --> 00:03:56.944
dis-ease in the body,
<v Regina>Ease. Mm-hmm.</v>

99
00:03:56.944 --> 00:03:59.344
<v ->or what medical science calls disease.</v>

100
00:03:59.344 --> 00:04:01.604
So the message I want to get out to people,

101
00:04:01.604 --> 00:04:03.274
what's the most important thing,

102
00:04:03.584 --> 00:04:07.623
is start eliminating the toxins from your environment

103
00:04:07.623 --> 00:04:10.394
'cause you are a product of your environment.

104
00:04:10.824 --> 00:04:13.031
What you expose yourself to,

105
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:15.571
what environment you live in, what environment

106
00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:18.541
surrounds yourselves is a direct reflection of you.

107
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:21.811
So if we want to turn the tables

108
00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:24.411
and start creating health and start creating

109
00:04:25.299 --> 00:04:27.869
positive thinking, spirituality,

110
00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:29.929
increasing our consciousness levels,

111
00:04:29.929 --> 00:04:32.269
then we have to start by taking two steps back

112
00:04:32.269 --> 00:04:35.119
and saying, "What's causing all this happening?"

113
00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:36.929
You know?
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

114
00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:39.764
<v ->Which is not the proper way the medical professional,</v>

115
00:04:39.764 --> 00:04:41.429
just as anything.
<v Regina>No. (laughs)</v>

116
00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:43.529
<v ->It's like, "Okay, let's cause the disease,</v>

117
00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:45.124
"and let's come up with a medication that will

118
00:04:45.124 --> 00:04:46.244
"cover up the symptoms,"
<v Regina>First you have to</v>

119
00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:47.584
have a name for it. (laughs)

120
00:04:47.584 --> 00:04:48.984
<v ->Yeah.
<v Regina>A patent, a name,</v>

121
00:04:48.984 --> 00:04:51.214
and suddenly, you have a new disease.

122
00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:53.484
<v ->New diseases popping up all the time.</v>

123
00:04:53.484 --> 00:04:54.864
<v Regina>Oh yeah, I see it. I see it.</v>

124
00:04:54.864 --> 00:04:57.284
(laughs) So let's take a--

125
00:04:57.284 --> 00:04:58.824
I want to give one little sliver,

126
00:04:58.824 --> 00:05:00.724
a little example of everyday life

127
00:05:00.724 --> 00:05:03.064
certainly in the western world, which is,

128
00:05:03.064 --> 00:05:06.631
you stop off in the morning, and you have, say, a latte.

129
00:05:06.631 --> 00:05:07.999
Maybe a double latte.

130
00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:09.638
You have milk, you have, oh,

131
00:05:09.638 --> 00:05:10.878
let's make it a mocha.

132
00:05:10.878 --> 00:05:12.478
You have chocolate and sugar,

133
00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.585
and you have caffeine in it.

134
00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:17.865
Let's just look at the implications of that one habit

135
00:05:17.865 --> 00:05:20.625
of the western world and its effect on the body.

136
00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:23.255
Right down to the milk.

137
00:05:24.045 --> 00:05:27.145
<v ->The first thing that happens in the morning</v>

138
00:05:27.145 --> 00:05:30.785
when you wake up is the mental thoughts

139
00:05:30.785 --> 00:05:32.705
of how you're going to start your day

140
00:05:32.705 --> 00:05:34.565
and whether or not you spend time meditating.

141
00:05:35.172 --> 00:05:37.112
Just from the time that you wake up, and you can trace

142
00:05:37.112 --> 00:05:38.652
it back to when you sleep at night,

143
00:05:38.652 --> 00:05:40.472
but just from the time that you wake up in the morning

144
00:05:40.472 --> 00:05:42.192
is really how your day starts and how you

145
00:05:42.192 --> 00:05:45.202
want to perform your day.

146
00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:47.792
If you were to meditate in the morning,

147
00:05:47.792 --> 00:05:50.052
or if you were to calm your mind, or if you were

148
00:05:50.052 --> 00:05:53.672
to be rested, again, taking it two steps back

149
00:05:53.672 --> 00:05:56.432
you probably wouldn't need that mocha to begin with.

150
00:05:56.432 --> 00:05:58.212
<v Regina>If you had slept well the day before.</v>

151
00:05:58.212 --> 00:05:59.972
<v ->If you had slept well before,</v>

152
00:05:59.972 --> 00:06:01.452
and you know because the people--

153
00:06:01.452 --> 00:06:03.412
it's addictive, number one, they like the taste.

154
00:06:03.412 --> 00:06:05.632
But most of it's the caffeine, they want the energy rush

155
00:06:05.632 --> 00:06:07.022
in the morning.
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

156
00:06:08.172 --> 00:06:09.592
<v ->So how does that affect the body?</v>

157
00:06:09.592 --> 00:06:11.989
Let's say you get up and the first thing you do,

158
00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:14.120
is without eating breakfast, without drinking any water,

159
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.880
the first thing you do is you go get your mocha.

160
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.100
What are the ingredients
<v Regina>Oops.</v>

161
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.920
<v ->of the mocha?
<v Regina>Dehydrated</v>

162
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.880
to begin with, right?
<v Edward>Exactly. Exactly.</v>

163
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.790
The body has three cycles it goes through.

164
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.220
It has the elimination cycle in the morning,

165
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.370
which usually happens between 4am and about 8am.

166
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.020
Then it goes into the appropriation cycle

167
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.620
in the mid-afternoon, and the assimilation cycle

168
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.699
in the evening.

169
00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.280
The body assimilates the proteins in the evening,

170
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.519
the time before you go to bed,

171
00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:41.800
and that's because that's when the body repairs itself.

172
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.250
At night, when you sleep.

173
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.680
<v Regina>And protein's an essential part</v>

174
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.240
of that repair.
<v Edward>And protein is</v>

175
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.431
always the essential part of repair.

176
00:06:48.431 --> 00:06:50.831
The appropriation cycle that takes place

177
00:06:50.831 --> 00:06:53.631
in the midday is your body storing energy

178
00:06:53.631 --> 00:06:55.571
for fuel to get you through the rest of the day

179
00:06:55.571 --> 00:06:58.711
and basically allocating these vitamins over here

180
00:06:58.711 --> 00:07:01.191
for repair and at night allocating these over there.

181
00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:03.231
But really what's important is the

182
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:04.911
elimination cycle in the morning.

183
00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:06.931
This is when your body has healed itself

184
00:07:06.931 --> 00:07:08.531
at night while you're sleeping, 'cause you're not

185
00:07:08.531 --> 00:07:10.131
in a state of stress, you're not--

186
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:13.241
your body can actually function and repair itself.

187
00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:15.431
In the morning when you get up

188
00:07:15.431 --> 00:07:17.651
is when the elimination cycle should start.

189
00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:19.811
Now, the elimination cycle is all the stuff

190
00:07:19.811 --> 00:07:22.091
that's been dumped in, all the byproducts of repair

191
00:07:22.091 --> 00:07:24.251
and everything that have been dumped into your colon

192
00:07:24.251 --> 00:07:26.901
to eliminate, needs to be eliminated.

193
00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:31.211
That's why only eating fruit for breakfast

194
00:07:31.211 --> 00:07:34.651
in the morning is what supports the elimination cycle,

195
00:07:34.651 --> 00:07:36.051
which means you should--

196
00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:37.231
what does fruit contain?

197
00:07:37.231 --> 00:07:39.411
Water to hydrate your bowels to increase

198
00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:42.111
the assimilation a day, increase the elimination.

199
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:44.731
Vitamins, minerals, nutrients,

200
00:07:44.731 --> 00:07:47.631
fiber and oxygen.

201
00:07:47.631 --> 00:07:50.350
So what happens when you don't have that

202
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.211
fresh fruit in the morning, and you have,

203
00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:54.871
like you said, the mocha in the morning,

204
00:07:54.871 --> 00:07:58.111
you're stopping the elimination process from happening.

205
00:07:58.111 --> 00:08:01.910
I mean sure, coffee acts as a mild laxative,

206
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.691
which you might have a bowel movement,

207
00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:05.671
but you're still not getting the hydration.

208
00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:07.271
You're not getting the repair of the cells,

209
00:08:07.271 --> 00:08:09.131
you're not getting what you need

210
00:08:09.131 --> 00:08:11.941
for your intestines to function throughout the day.

211
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.711
So without supporting the elimination process

212
00:08:14.711 --> 00:08:17.431
you're actually suppressing the elimination process

213
00:08:17.431 --> 00:08:19.911
by putting the mocha in.

214
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:22.191
Number one, you have your coffee beans.

215
00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:24.071
Your coffee beans have been roasted.

216
00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:25.448
Anytime you roast anything, you have

217
00:08:25.448 --> 00:08:26.848
high levels of nitrites.

218
00:08:26.848 --> 00:08:27.968
Nitrates and nitrites.

219
00:08:27.968 --> 00:08:29.668
Those are cancer-causing agents.

220
00:08:29.668 --> 00:08:32.988
So you have those that you're dealing with in the coffee.

221
00:08:32.988 --> 00:08:35.108
Then you have your volatile oils in the coffee,

222
00:08:35.108 --> 00:08:39.098
the oils from the beans that can cause damage to the bowel.

223
00:08:39.808 --> 00:08:43.268
Then you have the acidic makeup of the coffee,

224
00:08:43.268 --> 00:08:47.428
which is going to cause acid alterations,

225
00:08:47.428 --> 00:08:49.628
or pH changes in the bowel.

226
00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:53.538
So you've already taken care of poisoning the bowel,

227
00:08:53.748 --> 00:08:56.025
changing the pH level in the bowel,

228
00:08:56.025 --> 00:08:57.485
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>
(Edward chuckles)

229
00:08:58.224 --> 00:08:59.485
and then you have the caffeine,

230
00:08:59.485 --> 00:09:02.275
which is gonna act as a mild stimulant as well.

231
00:09:03.165 --> 00:09:05.525
Then you have the refined sugars.

232
00:09:05.525 --> 00:09:07.825
The refined sugars are going to actually feed

233
00:09:07.825 --> 00:09:09.904
all the Candida and all the organisms

234
00:09:09.904 --> 00:09:12.705
and cause, if there's any food left over

235
00:09:12.705 --> 00:09:14.585
in your system from the night before,

236
00:09:14.585 --> 00:09:17.425
they're gonna help progress

237
00:09:17.425 --> 00:09:19.605
the fermentation process

238
00:09:19.605 --> 00:09:20.985
of any carbohydrates that aren't

239
00:09:20.985 --> 00:09:22.445
already fermented.

240
00:09:22.445 --> 00:09:25.165
<v Regina>Fermented food in the gut is not a good thing.</v>

241
00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:26.905
<v ->Fermented food is taking--</v>

242
00:09:26.905 --> 00:09:28.105
let me give you an example.

243
00:09:28.105 --> 00:09:29.505
Let's say you go to McDonald's

244
00:09:29.505 --> 00:09:32.265
and get a cheeseburger with french fries.

245
00:09:32.265 --> 00:09:34.185
You have white flour on the bun,

246
00:09:34.185 --> 00:09:36.765
you have meat, you have trans fats,

247
00:09:36.765 --> 00:09:39.055
you have, you know, in the french fries.

248
00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:42.015
You have starches in the french fries.

249
00:09:42.465 --> 00:09:44.455
Let's say you eat that meal.

250
00:09:44.765 --> 00:09:48.105
Well, protein, (stammers)

251
00:09:48.105 --> 00:09:49.925
eating a protein and a starch at the same time

252
00:09:49.925 --> 00:09:52.845
inhibits the digestion of either one of them.

253
00:09:52.845 --> 00:09:54.855
So it'd be the equivalent if you were to put

254
00:09:55.605 --> 00:09:56.965
a McDonald's cheeseburger and fries

255
00:09:56.965 --> 00:09:59.604
in a Ziploc bag, throw it out in the 98 degree heat,

256
00:09:59.604 --> 00:10:02.004
98.6, which is the body temperature,

257
00:10:02.004 --> 00:10:04.385
and let it sit there for four or five days.

258
00:10:04.385 --> 00:10:06.145
You're gonna get--go back over there

259
00:10:06.145 --> 00:10:08.315
and you're gonna open it up and it's gonna smell so bad.

260
00:10:08.315 --> 00:10:10.675
If you could smell your intestines,

261
00:10:10.675 --> 00:10:12.195
if people could just--

262
00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:15.275
if your intestines would say, "Hello, I'm toxic,

263
00:10:15.275 --> 00:10:16.875
"can you help me out? Let me just give you a whiff

264
00:10:16.875 --> 00:10:18.535
"of what's going on down here."

265
00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:20.555
You would be like, "Okay,
(Regina laughs)

266
00:10:20.555 --> 00:10:21.629
"I'm gonna start eating a little bit

267
00:10:21.629 --> 00:10:23.229
"more healthy around here."

268
00:10:23.229 --> 00:10:24.689
<v Regina>So you're saying that what's the contents</v>

269
00:10:24.689 --> 00:10:26.989
of that plastic bag, somewhat emulates

270
00:10:26.989 --> 00:10:28.849
what's going on down below.

271
00:10:28.849 --> 00:10:30.989
<v ->It exactly emulates what's going on.</v>

272
00:10:30.989 --> 00:10:32.429
People aren't chewing their food enough

273
00:10:32.429 --> 00:10:33.869
so they're not breaking it down,

274
00:10:33.869 --> 00:10:37.619
so what you're gonna have is putrefactive protein,

275
00:10:37.883 --> 00:10:40.763
fermented carbohydrates, and rancid fats.

276
00:10:40.763 --> 00:10:43.383
That is completely changing the molecular structure

277
00:10:43.383 --> 00:10:45.277
of what is good for you and changing it

278
00:10:45.277 --> 00:10:47.804
into something better, it's just rotting food

279
00:10:47.804 --> 00:10:48.984
inside your system.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

280
00:10:48.984 --> 00:10:51.124
<v ->And that gives back to the whole point of toxicity</v>

281
00:10:51.124 --> 00:10:53.904
and those acids leaking through the intestinal wall,

282
00:10:53.904 --> 00:10:55.844
those poisons leaking through the intestinal wall

283
00:10:55.844 --> 00:10:58.964
and going into the bloodstream causing blood toxemia,

284
00:10:58.964 --> 00:11:00.944
and then the blood poisoning the organs or cells

285
00:11:00.944 --> 00:11:03.314
or the water that surrounds the cell membrane.

286
00:11:04.124 --> 00:11:05.484
<v Regina>So when--</v>

287
00:11:05.484 --> 00:11:06.964
we didn't finish the milk.

288
00:11:06.964 --> 00:11:08.264
The milk in the mocha.
<v Edward>Oh, the milk.</v>

289
00:11:08.264 --> 00:11:09.351
<v Regina>That's interesting,</v>
<v Edward>The milk--</v>

290
00:11:09.351 --> 00:11:10.491
<v Regina>has some interesting stats</v>

291
00:11:10.491 --> 00:11:11.671
and toxins.
<v Edward>So we edited</v>

292
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:12.931
the refined sugar, but I forgot

293
00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:15.091
to tell you also about
<v Regina>Right.</v>

294
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:18.531
the refined sugar feeding the Candida

295
00:11:18.531 --> 00:11:21.291
that's in the bowel that 99% of the people have.

296
00:11:21.291 --> 00:11:24.511
The Candida in the bowel release toxins

297
00:11:24.511 --> 00:11:26.551
and cause you to be fatigued in the afternoon

298
00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:28.781
and just wreak havoc on the system.

299
00:11:29.111 --> 00:11:31.671
Which the milk actually does too, because of the sugars

300
00:11:31.671 --> 00:11:34.381
in the milk that end up converting to glucose.

301
00:11:35.271 --> 00:11:38.801
But the milk, if you analyze it,

302
00:11:38.801 --> 00:11:40.901
actually has hormones in it,

303
00:11:41.051 --> 00:11:43.031
has antibiotic residue in it,

304
00:11:43.031 --> 00:11:45.661
and the worst is it has pus in it.

305
00:11:45.951 --> 00:11:47.171
<v Regina>From the infected udders...</v>

306
00:11:47.171 --> 00:11:48.871
<v ->From the infected udders.
<v Regina>is disgusting.</v>

307
00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:50.751
And it has DDT.
(Edward laughs)

308
00:11:50.751 --> 00:11:53.071
<v ->And it has DDT. It has a lot
(Regina groans)

309
00:11:53.071 --> 00:11:55.731
of different stuff in the milk, I mean, okay.

310
00:11:55.731 --> 00:11:58.821
Anything that the cattle was exposed to--

311
00:11:59.571 --> 00:12:03.901
getting milk from a cow that ate rendered food--

312
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:07.131
you know how bad rendered food is

313
00:12:07.131 --> 00:12:08.971
from down in Mexico where they literally--

314
00:12:08.971 --> 00:12:10.951
<v Regina>I do, but why don't you explain.</v>

315
00:12:10.951 --> 00:12:13.666
<v ->Rendered food is what most animals</v>

316
00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:16.316
and pets eat, and a lot of the feed lots

317
00:12:16.506 --> 00:12:19.236
for cattle and chicken are fed.

318
00:12:19.246 --> 00:12:24.035
How is rendered food made is these big, huge

319
00:12:24.906 --> 00:12:28.186
lots of land down in Mexico where all the supermarkets

320
00:12:28.186 --> 00:12:31.666
ship all their spoiled meats to, all the dead animals

321
00:12:31.666 --> 00:12:34.766
from all of the veterinary clinics that are still

322
00:12:34.766 --> 00:12:38.326
in the bags, the black, plastic bags,

323
00:12:38.326 --> 00:12:40.096
get shipped down there.

324
00:12:40.366 --> 00:12:43.666
All of the diseased animals, all the animals

325
00:12:43.666 --> 00:12:46.446
that the people pick up that the counties

326
00:12:46.446 --> 00:12:48.746
pick up on the sides of the roads,

327
00:12:48.746 --> 00:12:50.466
get shipped down there.

328
00:12:52.886 --> 00:12:56.596
Flea collars still on, medals on animals,

329
00:12:56.806 --> 00:12:59.266
all these animals sitting in the 98 degree heat

330
00:12:59.266 --> 00:13:02.106
for days at a time are just swarmed with maggots

331
00:13:02.106 --> 00:13:05.186
and disease, and they literally bulldoze all those

332
00:13:05.186 --> 00:13:09.336
into a big pit of boiling water,

333
00:13:09.846 --> 00:13:13.876
and literally boil off all of the carcuses and everything.

334
00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:16.926
Then they strain it and they get the tallow, or the fat

335
00:13:16.926 --> 00:13:19.103
which rises to the top, and they use that fat.

336
00:13:19.103 --> 00:13:21.503
Which we know, all toxins are stored

337
00:13:21.503 --> 00:13:22.823
in the fat tissue, or a lot
<v Regina>In the fat.</v>

338
00:13:22.823 --> 00:13:23.923
<v ->of them are stored in the
<v Regina>Exactly.</v>

339
00:13:23.923 --> 00:13:25.353
<v ->fat tissue.
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

340
00:13:26.403 --> 00:13:28.423
<v ->After they've already been processed</v>

341
00:13:28.423 --> 00:13:30.713
as much as possible in the water,

342
00:13:31.503 --> 00:13:33.823
and fat tissue has mostly water anyway,

343
00:13:33.823 --> 00:13:36.523
but anyway, then they take, then they dehydrate.

344
00:13:36.523 --> 00:13:39.060
They suck all the water out of that (clears throat)

345
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.620
and all the styrofoam goes in there,

346
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.700
all the pesticide residue, all the antibiotics

347
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.040
that those cattle were fed, all the heartworm medications

348
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.140
and collars on all the animals.

349
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.880
I mean, we're talking about just a pile

350
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.260
of chemical, disease, and you can't mix

351
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.460
this animal with this animal because you're just

352
00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.390
cross-mutating these diseases.

353
00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.060
Then they suck the water out of it and they dry it

354
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.037
into little pellets, and then they feed that to--

355
00:14:06.037 --> 00:14:08.567
so they literally recycle animals.

356
00:14:08.637 --> 00:14:10.939
Animal dies, it goes back into the rendering plant

357
00:14:10.939 --> 00:14:12.624
which gets recycled back again

358
00:14:12.624 --> 00:14:14.354
to the next animal that eats it.

359
00:14:14.724 --> 00:14:17.744
So that comes through the milk and gets stored in the meat

360
00:14:18.131 --> 00:14:20.391
that we eventually eat or drink.

361
00:14:20.391 --> 00:14:21.991
<v Regina>Mm-hmm. Okay.</v>

362
00:14:21.991 --> 00:14:24.591
Well, I think we've covered that problem. (laughs)

363
00:14:25.309 --> 00:14:26.656
What we're trying to say here is

364
00:14:26.656 --> 00:14:28.256
it's not the best way to start your day.

365
00:14:28.256 --> 00:14:31.126
Instead you want to have some organic, fresh fruit.

366
00:14:31.516 --> 00:14:33.276
This is just focusing on the food part

367
00:14:33.276 --> 00:14:37.386
because I think we know that our air sucks, basically.

368
00:14:37.556 --> 00:14:39.436
There are so many contaminants in it and we know

369
00:14:39.436 --> 00:14:41.896
that there are filters, and you recommend, in fact,

370
00:14:41.896 --> 00:14:44.716
off of Joseph Mercola's site, one of the air filters

371
00:14:44.716 --> 00:14:48.286
that he has available is a really good air filter.

372
00:14:48.556 --> 00:14:49.756
We'll talk about water in a bit,

373
00:14:49.756 --> 00:14:51.096
but let's just progress through food

374
00:14:51.096 --> 00:14:52.676
because we don't have a lot of time together.

375
00:14:52.676 --> 00:14:54.096
You have a flight to catch.

376
00:14:54.096 --> 00:14:55.456
Okay, progressing through food.

377
00:14:55.456 --> 00:14:58.056
You have your nice, fresh, organic fruit in the morning.

378
00:14:58.056 --> 00:14:59.656
Let's go through the day, and what would the day

379
00:14:59.656 --> 00:15:01.296
look like in a really healthy diet?

380
00:15:01.296 --> 00:15:03.076
Including throwing in the top supplements

381
00:15:03.076 --> 00:15:05.166
that you need to keep your guts healthy.

382
00:15:05.556 --> 00:15:08.456
<v ->A really healthy diet would consist of five meals</v>

383
00:15:08.456 --> 00:15:10.876
a day, and it would consist--

384
00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:13.096
well, a really, really healthy diet would be more or less

385
00:15:13.096 --> 00:15:14.956
like when we watch the animals.

386
00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:16.796
The animals pick and they go.

387
00:15:16.796 --> 00:15:19.177
If you watch a squirrel, for example,

388
00:15:19.177 --> 00:15:21.617
they bury their food, they take food very seriously.

389
00:15:21.617 --> 00:15:23.857
It's very fresh. They eat multiple times a day.

390
00:15:23.857 --> 00:15:25.797
They have multiple bowel movements a day,

391
00:15:25.797 --> 00:15:28.037
and they pay attention to their food.

392
00:15:28.037 --> 00:15:30.567
Any animal, for instance, will pay attention to their food.

393
00:15:30.877 --> 00:15:32.957
Us, on the other hand, we've been converted

394
00:15:32.957 --> 00:15:36.057
into processed and canned, what's easy to throw

395
00:15:36.057 --> 00:15:38.077
in the microwave, et cetera.

396
00:15:38.626 --> 00:15:41.577
With that being said, a fairly perfect day

397
00:15:41.577 --> 00:15:43.827
would be about five small meals a day.

398
00:15:44.597 --> 00:15:47.897
The diet I recommend is consistent with the biochemistry

399
00:15:47.897 --> 00:15:50.697
of the body, or what the body does.

400
00:15:50.697 --> 00:15:51.977
Those three systems that happen,

401
00:15:51.977 --> 00:15:54.017
the elimination, appropriation, and assimilation.

402
00:15:54.017 --> 00:15:55.557
<v Regina>And this is true for all human beings</v>

403
00:15:55.557 --> 00:15:56.417
for the most part.
<v Edward>This is true</v>

404
00:15:56.417 --> 00:15:57.597
for all human beings.
<v Regina>Yes. So it's--</v>

405
00:15:57.597 --> 00:15:59.237
<v ->All human beings.
<v Regina>Yeah. Mm-hmm.</v>

406
00:15:59.237 --> 00:16:01.724
<v ->In the morning, eat as much--</v>

407
00:16:01.724 --> 00:16:04.024
fruits need to be subdivided into three categories,

408
00:16:04.024 --> 00:16:07.744
acid fruits, sweet fruits, and subacid fruits.

409
00:16:07.744 --> 00:16:11.004
What I recommend is you can mix sweet

410
00:16:11.004 --> 00:16:13.304
and subacid, or acid and subacid,

411
00:16:13.304 --> 00:16:15.524
but you shouldn't mix acid and sweet

412
00:16:15.524 --> 00:16:16.524
fruits together.
<v Regina>Give us an idea</v>

413
00:16:16.524 --> 00:16:17.604
of which fruits you're talking about

414
00:16:17.604 --> 00:16:19.024
and how you would mix them.
<v Edward>For example,</v>

415
00:16:19.024 --> 00:16:21.844
you wouldn't want to mix an orange with a banana.

416
00:16:21.844 --> 00:16:24.684
You would want to stick with an acid fruit like orange,

417
00:16:24.684 --> 00:16:26.304
lemon, lime, something like that.

418
00:16:26.304 --> 00:16:27.724
<v Regina>Grapefruit.</v>
<v Edward>Grapefruit,</v>

419
00:16:27.724 --> 00:16:30.304
then a subacid would be cherries, blackberries,

420
00:16:30.304 --> 00:16:32.244
raspberries, something like that.

421
00:16:32.244 --> 00:16:34.764
Melons are in a different category by themselves.

422
00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:37.014
Even though they're a fruit,

423
00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:39.274
they fully digest within 20 minutes,

424
00:16:39.864 --> 00:16:42.894
and they're very effective

425
00:16:43.384 --> 00:16:45.854
at cleansing the system because they're mostly water.

426
00:16:46.104 --> 00:16:47.104
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>
<v Edward>That would be</v>

427
00:16:47.104 --> 00:16:48.558
cantaloupe, honeydew melon,

428
00:16:48.558 --> 00:16:50.438
watermelon, et cetera, 'cause I--

429
00:16:50.438 --> 00:16:52.938
but I'd group those in sweet fruits anyway.

430
00:16:52.938 --> 00:16:54.305
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>
<v Edward>So basically,</v>

431
00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:57.085
what I recommend is either pick one from each category,

432
00:16:57.085 --> 00:16:59.231
don't mix them all, just pick,

433
00:16:59.231 --> 00:17:01.451
let's say watermelon for breakfast today.

434
00:17:01.451 --> 00:17:03.311
Tomorrow I'm gonna have oranges for breakfast.

435
00:17:03.311 --> 00:17:04.598
Tomorrow, the next day, I'm gonna have

436
00:17:04.598 --> 00:17:05.848
cantaloupe for breakfast.

437
00:17:05.848 --> 00:17:07.808
There's plenty of fruits that you can go weeks

438
00:17:07.808 --> 00:17:09.633
with a different fruit every morning,

439
00:17:09.633 --> 00:17:12.013
and eat as much of it as you want.

440
00:17:12.013 --> 00:17:14.123
As much of it until you're full.

441
00:17:14.613 --> 00:17:18.253
Drinking water, because remember that fruit

442
00:17:18.253 --> 00:17:21.270
contains fructose, which is fruit sugar.

443
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.320
If you mix fructose or you mix fruit

444
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.840
with milk, if you drink milk and eat fruit

445
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.780
or if you eat a croissant with some fruit,

446
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.580
or you eat yogurt with fruit,

447
00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.220
or you mix fruit with anything else

448
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.168
it's not, it's going to convert and it's gonna convert

449
00:17:37.168 --> 00:17:39.708
to glucose and it's gonna take longer to digest.

450
00:17:39.708 --> 00:17:41.968
The whole point of the elimination process in the morning

451
00:17:41.968 --> 00:17:44.928
is to keep the fructose, fructose,

452
00:17:44.928 --> 00:17:47.088
and keep the fruit in the system

453
00:17:47.088 --> 00:17:49.348
so it doesn't ferment or cause any change.

454
00:17:49.348 --> 00:17:51.008
<v Regina>Okay, let's go to the next meal.</v>

455
00:17:51.008 --> 00:17:52.995
<v ->The next meal is a mid-morning snack.</v>

456
00:17:52.995 --> 00:17:56.255
For a mid-morning snack, I recommend a handful,

457
00:17:56.255 --> 00:17:59.055
because most people are busy in their day at that time.

458
00:17:59.055 --> 00:18:01.500
I always hear, "I don't have time to eat,

459
00:18:01.907 --> 00:18:03.747
"mid-morning I'm right in the middle of meetings

460
00:18:03.747 --> 00:18:05.067
"or just getting out of meetings,"

461
00:18:05.067 --> 00:18:06.907
so I'm gonna make it easy for you.

462
00:18:06.907 --> 00:18:09.207
For a mid-morning snack you grab a handful

463
00:18:09.207 --> 00:18:11.107
of seeds, raw seeds.

464
00:18:11.107 --> 00:18:14.667
They have the most energy per Kcalorie,

465
00:18:15.025 --> 00:18:17.445
they will give you a boost of energy

466
00:18:17.445 --> 00:18:18.485
and they will fill you up.

467
00:18:18.485 --> 00:18:19.605
Just a handful will fill you up.

468
00:18:19.605 --> 00:18:21.765
It takes less than, when I tell people

469
00:18:21.765 --> 00:18:24.305
five small meals a day, you can eat each meal

470
00:18:24.305 --> 00:18:26.185
in less than two minutes.

471
00:18:26.185 --> 00:18:27.705
<v Regina>Okay, so you're talking about any,</v>

472
00:18:27.705 --> 00:18:30.645
I mean it could be sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds,

473
00:18:30.645 --> 00:18:32.005
hemp seeds, flax, anything.
<v Edward>Flax seeds,</v>

474
00:18:32.005 --> 00:18:33.425
hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds,
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

475
00:18:33.425 --> 00:18:34.745
<v ->but they just have to be raw.</v>

476
00:18:34.745 --> 00:18:35.805
<v Regina>Okay.</v>
<v Edward>And that you can</v>

477
00:18:35.805 --> 00:18:37.065
change up on a daily basis.

478
00:18:37.065 --> 00:18:37.686
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

479
00:18:37.686 --> 00:18:40.713
<v ->Or for a mid-morning snack, like a hemp bar.</v>

480
00:18:40.713 --> 00:18:42.207
You know, a hemp bar.
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

481
00:18:42.207 --> 00:18:43.547
I want to try to make it easy

482
00:18:43.547 --> 00:18:46.667
for our society so people don't have to cook a lot,

483
00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:48.917
they can just grab something and eat it.

484
00:18:49.767 --> 00:18:53.714
Lunch is going to be your vegetable starch meal.

485
00:18:53.714 --> 00:18:54.824
(clears throat)

486
00:18:55.494 --> 00:18:57.114
Don't want to introduce a lot of protein

487
00:18:57.114 --> 00:18:59.374
at lunch, 'cause it's gonna slow the body down.

488
00:18:59.374 --> 00:19:01.421
That's why people end up with fatigue

489
00:19:01.421 --> 00:19:03.161
in the afternoon.

490
00:19:03.161 --> 00:19:05.041
The lunch should be a salad,

491
00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:08.021
or some fresh-cut vegetable sticks,

492
00:19:08.021 --> 00:19:10.281
something like that, and then a starch source

493
00:19:10.281 --> 00:19:12.453
like a sweet potato,

494
00:19:12.453 --> 00:19:16.293
or some organic brown rice, or--

495
00:19:16.293 --> 00:19:17.413
<v Regina>Complex carbohydrates.</v>

496
00:19:17.413 --> 00:19:18.693
<v ->Complex carbohydrates,
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

497
00:19:18.693 --> 00:19:22.303
<v ->some sort of like a seven-grain, or sprouted grain.</v>

498
00:19:22.373 --> 00:19:23.773
Bread or something like that.

499
00:19:23.773 --> 00:19:25.313
That's gonna give you, again, some energy

500
00:19:25.313 --> 00:19:26.553
to get you through the rest of the day.

501
00:19:26.553 --> 00:19:27.744
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

502
00:19:27.873 --> 00:19:30.573
<v ->The mid-afternoon snack, is we use the same thing</v>

503
00:19:30.573 --> 00:19:32.833
for the mid-morning, but I have three different things

504
00:19:32.833 --> 00:19:34.133
people can choose from.

505
00:19:34.133 --> 00:19:36.672
Usually like a super green drink,

506
00:19:36.672 --> 00:19:41.462
or a handful of seeds, or some organic cottage cheese

507
00:19:42.733 --> 00:19:44.373
with some flaxseed oil mixed in it.

508
00:19:44.373 --> 00:19:46.693
That's the Breuss Cancer Cure.

509
00:19:46.693 --> 00:19:49.153
It's just a good,
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

510
00:19:49.153 --> 00:19:50.973
<v ->good supplement to have.</v>

511
00:19:50.973 --> 00:19:53.233
So you either pick, like, for your mid-morning

512
00:19:53.233 --> 00:19:55.192
you're gonna have seeds and mid-afternoon

513
00:19:55.192 --> 00:19:56.633
you're gonna have cottage cheese or vice versa,

514
00:19:56.633 --> 00:19:57.673
or you can do whatever.

515
00:19:57.673 --> 00:19:59.193
You can also, for your mid-morning

516
00:19:59.193 --> 00:20:01.253
and mid-afternoon, eat some fruit.

517
00:20:01.253 --> 00:20:02.533
<v Regina>Okay.</v>
<v Edward>Because as long</v>

518
00:20:02.533 --> 00:20:04.353
as you're not gonna be eating lunch in 20 minutes

519
00:20:04.353 --> 00:20:06.353
after your mid-morning snack you're gonna be okay.

520
00:20:06.353 --> 00:20:08.493
<v Regina>It's still fructose. Then dinner.</v>

521
00:20:08.493 --> 00:20:09.853
Where's the protein come in?

522
00:20:09.853 --> 00:20:11.213
<v ->Protein comes in at dinner,</v>

523
00:20:11.213 --> 00:20:12.913
that's when your body needs all that fresh,

524
00:20:12.913 --> 00:20:15.863
good protein, so range-fed,

525
00:20:16.093 --> 00:20:17.653
some people eat eggs.

526
00:20:17.653 --> 00:20:20.353
I say if you're going to eat protein,

527
00:20:20.353 --> 00:20:22.483
make sure if you're gonna eat meat,

528
00:20:22.933 --> 00:20:24.393
stay away from soy because of all the

529
00:20:24.393 --> 00:20:26.393
phytoestrogens in soy.

530
00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:28.563
But if you're gonna supplement with protein,

531
00:20:29.233 --> 00:20:33.483
wild game, fish, uncontaminated fish,

532
00:20:33.773 --> 00:20:37.452
eggs, eggs are a really good source of protein

533
00:20:37.851 --> 00:20:39.832
especially if you can get maiden eggs.

534
00:20:39.832 --> 00:20:42.192
Maiden eggs are the first eggs that the chicken lays

535
00:20:42.192 --> 00:20:44.202
from your organic chicken farm.

536
00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:48.342
Some people have hemp protein drinks,

537
00:20:49.152 --> 00:20:51.552
and then vegetables with the protein meal.

538
00:20:51.552 --> 00:20:53.732
Vegetables and fats with the protein meals.

539
00:20:53.732 --> 00:20:54.780
<v Regina>Okay.</v>
<v Edward>That's where you</v>

540
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.117
can have a little bit of organic butter,

541
00:20:59.127 --> 00:21:02.827
or your oils, and then having your salad and any type

542
00:21:02.827 --> 00:21:05.027
of vegetables with your protein meal

543
00:21:05.027 --> 00:21:06.544
work great, so it's
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

544
00:21:06.544 --> 00:21:08.924
vegetable protein meal at night.

545
00:21:08.924 --> 00:21:11.444
Really, the body, you really shouldn't eat

546
00:21:11.444 --> 00:21:14.704
a lot of, or you could just, if you're a vegetarian,

547
00:21:14.704 --> 00:21:17.544
just eat a lot of beans, peas, stuff like that.

548
00:21:17.544 --> 00:21:19.164
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>
<v Edward>A lot of people</v>

549
00:21:19.164 --> 00:21:21.364
use protein-rich soups, just mixing a lot

550
00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:22.844
of lentils and bean soups
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

551
00:21:22.844 --> 00:21:25.254
<v ->for dinner, that works really good too.</v>

552
00:21:25.624 --> 00:21:27.504
So that's gonna be your protein source.

553
00:21:27.504 --> 00:21:28.844
<v Regina>So there we have the meals</v>

554
00:21:28.844 --> 00:21:31.364
as we should eat them, and now we go onto water.

555
00:21:31.364 --> 00:21:34.314
How do we get water that has oxygen in it?

556
00:21:34.444 --> 00:21:36.484
I know you're a fan of Patrick Flanagan's work

557
00:21:36.484 --> 00:21:38.724
in terms of his MegaHydran.

558
00:21:38.724 --> 00:21:41.224
That's one way to get a boost in your water,

559
00:21:41.224 --> 00:21:45.664
but also you talked about food grade peroxide--

560
00:21:45.664 --> 00:21:47.244
hydrogen peroxide.

561
00:21:48.244 --> 00:21:50.444
<v ->Water's one of those living substances</v>

562
00:21:50.444 --> 00:21:52.824
that just continues to change, so (clears throat)

563
00:21:52.824 --> 00:21:54.534
I recommend...

564
00:21:54.925 --> 00:21:57.524
I have the Wellness filtration system in my house.

565
00:21:57.524 --> 00:21:59.484
I think that that's kind of the best, because it goes

566
00:21:59.484 --> 00:22:02.084
through nine different layers of media,

567
00:22:02.084 --> 00:22:03.984
there's different types of stones in there,

568
00:22:03.984 --> 00:22:05.844
magnetic stones, far-infrared stones

569
00:22:05.844 --> 00:22:09.064
that actually energize the water and reduce the energy

570
00:22:09.064 --> 00:22:11.724
signatures on the water, and it was developed

571
00:22:11.724 --> 00:22:14.224
by Japanese scientists.

572
00:22:14.224 --> 00:22:15.984
The reason I like it is because it does more

573
00:22:15.984 --> 00:22:19.464
than just filter water, it has volcanic sand in there,

574
00:22:19.464 --> 00:22:22.824
it has different types of rare Japanese stones in there.

575
00:22:22.824 --> 00:22:25.644
It has eight different layers of media that it goes through

576
00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:28.744
far-infrared, so it actually magnetizes the water,

577
00:22:28.744 --> 00:22:31.244
energizes the water, cleans the water,

578
00:22:31.244 --> 00:22:33.164
and takes out any contaminates in the water.

579
00:22:33.164 --> 00:22:34.361
<v Regina>Now, they can find out about this on your</v>

580
00:22:34.361 --> 00:22:37.261
website, we can learn about
<v Edward>Yes.</v>

581
00:22:37.261 --> 00:22:38.781
<v Regina>much of what you said and much more</v>

582
00:22:38.781 --> 00:22:40.624
on your website, right?
<v Edward>Mm-hmm.</v>

583
00:22:40.624 --> 00:22:43.784
<v Regina>Okay, now let's get to supplements</v>

584
00:22:43.784 --> 00:22:45.784
because there's one in particular that you say

585
00:22:45.784 --> 00:22:47.631
is really critical and that's getting oxygen

586
00:22:47.631 --> 00:22:49.851
down to start breaking up the matter in the guts

587
00:22:49.851 --> 00:22:51.881
so it can move on out of the body.

588
00:22:52.111 --> 00:22:53.861
And you have a product yourself.

589
00:22:54.652 --> 00:22:57.051
<v ->Exactly, the reason why we developed that product</v>

590
00:22:57.051 --> 00:22:58.872
is because we tested everything else out

591
00:22:58.872 --> 00:23:01.092
there on the market, there was only one that was working

592
00:23:01.092 --> 00:23:04.059
that we were using, and having the most success with,

593
00:23:04.059 --> 00:23:05.906
and that was the Homozon.

594
00:23:05.906 --> 00:23:08.265
Basically it took us seven years and we wanted to make

595
00:23:08.265 --> 00:23:11.845
a product that was better, safer, and easier to take.

596
00:23:11.845 --> 00:23:13.726
That's when we came up with Oxy-Powder.

597
00:23:13.726 --> 00:23:16.545
Oxy-Powder's just a complex form

598
00:23:16.545 --> 00:23:18.965
of ozonated magnesium oxides

599
00:23:18.965 --> 00:23:21.435
mixed together, and it's a very,

600
00:23:22.705 --> 00:23:26.765
very complex module

601
00:23:26.765 --> 00:23:29.065
or steps to make this product.

602
00:23:29.065 --> 00:23:31.205
There's a lot of products out there that claim

603
00:23:31.205 --> 00:23:33.445
they're oxygen cleansers, but they just mix

604
00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:36.225
a few different ingredients and it gives just a spike

605
00:23:36.225 --> 00:23:38.975
of oxygen in a lab test, and then they quit.

606
00:23:40.006 --> 00:23:42.866
Our product and Homozon still release oxygen

607
00:23:42.866 --> 00:23:44.666
after 16 hours.
<v Regina>Mm.</v>

608
00:23:44.666 --> 00:23:47.025
<v ->So even if some of our molecules</v>

609
00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:48.546
get into the bloodstream, they're still--

610
00:23:48.546 --> 00:23:50.366
we just stopped the testing after 16 hours.

611
00:23:50.366 --> 00:23:51.726
Who knows how long it was,
<v Regina>Right.</v>

612
00:23:51.726 --> 00:23:54.386
<v ->you know, continually releasing oxygen?</v>

613
00:23:54.386 --> 00:23:56.366
<v Regina>Right, and this is in lieu of, I should add,</v>

614
00:23:56.366 --> 00:23:59.696
this is in lieu of taking a lot of the bulk things.

615
00:23:59.926 --> 00:24:01.127
Senna, for example.

616
00:24:01.127 --> 00:24:02.566
A lot of people are allergic to that stuff

617
00:24:02.566 --> 00:24:07.086
and have problems, all of the stool softener bulkers

618
00:24:07.086 --> 00:24:10.547
that you see on the market don't work for everybody.

619
00:24:10.547 --> 00:24:12.087
They work for some, but they don't work well

620
00:24:12.087 --> 00:24:14.367
for others at all, maybe even create more blockages,

621
00:24:14.367 --> 00:24:16.028
so that's why you came up with this

622
00:24:16.028 --> 00:24:17.248
as a solution.
<v Edward>That's exactly</v>

623
00:24:17.248 --> 00:24:19.628
right, because herbal colon cleansers

624
00:24:19.628 --> 00:24:20.827
are actually dangerous.

625
00:24:20.827 --> 00:24:22.947
There's been a lot of infomercials out on TV,

626
00:24:22.947 --> 00:24:25.888
and they're promoting these herbal-based colon cleansers.

627
00:24:25.888 --> 00:24:28.128
What's happening is everybody is starting to jump

628
00:24:28.128 --> 00:24:30.867
on the bandwagon, they're all trying to make a buck.

629
00:24:30.867 --> 00:24:33.448
They're importing most of these herbs from China

630
00:24:33.448 --> 00:24:37.848
and India, they're importing very, very low quality herbs.

631
00:24:37.848 --> 00:24:39.828
They're making these products for probably

632
00:24:39.828 --> 00:24:41.988
$1.50 a bottle, and they're just,

633
00:24:41.988 --> 00:24:44.048
and they're selling them for $40, $50

634
00:24:44.048 --> 00:24:46.577
and just literally ripping people off.

635
00:24:47.328 --> 00:24:49.299
It's our job to try to bring attention.

636
00:24:49.299 --> 00:24:51.239
I've written articles about the dangers of these

637
00:24:51.239 --> 00:24:53.819
herbal colon cleansers out there, telling people

638
00:24:53.819 --> 00:24:55.849
to watch out for them.

639
00:24:56.299 --> 00:25:00.479
What they do is, even these herbs are contaminated.

640
00:25:00.479 --> 00:25:01.919
They're contaminated with pesticides,

641
00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:03.199
they're contaminated with insecticides,

642
00:25:03.199 --> 00:25:04.719
they're contaminated with heavy metals.

643
00:25:04.719 --> 00:25:05.979
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v Edward>And all these</v>

644
00:25:05.979 --> 00:25:08.319
people are doing are putting more toxins in their system

645
00:25:08.319 --> 00:25:11.459
and not only that, they don't work.

646
00:25:11.459 --> 00:25:13.619
They don't take all,
<v Regina>Right.</v>

647
00:25:13.619 --> 00:25:15.800
<v ->they don't melt away</v>

648
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.699
all the toxic residue that's built up

649
00:25:17.699 --> 00:25:19.119
in your system over years.

650
00:25:19.119 --> 00:25:21.319
It's not like oxygen which oxidizes

651
00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:23.959
these chemicals, take for example Senna,

652
00:25:23.959 --> 00:25:25.639
which is just an osmotic laxative.

653
00:25:25.639 --> 00:25:26.859
It's just gonna draw water.

654
00:25:26.859 --> 00:25:29.749
It's not gonna address any root cause of a problem.

655
00:25:30.766 --> 00:25:33.123
Above that, these herbs are all radiated.

656
00:25:33.123 --> 00:25:34.803
They're radiated when they come in,

657
00:25:34.803 --> 00:25:36.623
which means that the molecular
<v Regina>Right. Right.</v>

658
00:25:36.623 --> 00:25:38.503
<v ->structures of them are all already altered</v>

659
00:25:38.503 --> 00:25:41.203
so they're not gonna really perform

660
00:25:41.203 --> 00:25:44.543
any function in the bowel, but just sending that signal,

661
00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:47.033
that wrong signal to ourselves.

662
00:25:47.423 --> 00:25:49.923
Psyllium Husk is very popular. What does it do?

663
00:25:49.923 --> 00:25:52.084
It goes in there and sucks up water.

664
00:25:52.084 --> 00:25:54.864
Sucks up the one thing you need.

665
00:25:54.864 --> 00:25:56.124
<v Regina>The water. Yeah.</v>
<v Edward>It sucks up</v>

666
00:25:56.124 --> 00:25:58.144
the water and then it bulks up in your system

667
00:25:58.144 --> 00:25:59.864
and then you end up with more constipation

668
00:25:59.864 --> 00:26:01.804
or it scrapes the side.

669
00:26:01.804 --> 00:26:03.644
Now, (clears throat)

670
00:26:03.644 --> 00:26:06.384
there's been a lot of people trying to promote online

671
00:26:06.384 --> 00:26:08.464
where you see these people holding up

672
00:26:08.464 --> 00:26:11.024
these big, stringy things of whatever

673
00:26:11.024 --> 00:26:12.664
came out of their bowel.

674
00:26:12.664 --> 00:26:15.204
If you mix Psyllium with some white flour

675
00:26:15.204 --> 00:26:17.164
and some water and some fats and everything

676
00:26:17.164 --> 00:26:19.064
and let it sit there, you're gonna be able

677
00:26:19.064 --> 00:26:20.524
to pull up the same thing.
(Regina laughs)

678
00:26:20.524 --> 00:26:21.964
These things aren't coming out.

679
00:26:21.964 --> 00:26:23.924
This isn't stuff coming out that's been compacted

680
00:26:23.924 --> 00:26:26.184
in these people's bowels, this is the Psyllium

681
00:26:26.184 --> 00:26:28.064
and the herbs that are mixing with all the stuff

682
00:26:28.064 --> 00:26:29.754
they already have in there and they're just

683
00:26:30.884 --> 00:26:32.764
eliminating it and then picking it up saying,

684
00:26:32.764 --> 00:26:34.244
"Look what came out of me."

685
00:26:34.244 --> 00:26:36.764
You mix white flour and all these bulking agents together

686
00:26:36.764 --> 00:26:39.364
and of course you're gonna get some long string of stuff.

687
00:26:39.364 --> 00:26:42.104
So they're using these marketing tactics, though,

688
00:26:42.104 --> 00:26:44.364
to get people, "Oh my gosh, look at all the stuff

689
00:26:44.364 --> 00:26:46.764
"that's coming out of my system," and they're using--

690
00:26:46.764 --> 00:26:49.184
they're deceiving the public

691
00:26:49.184 --> 00:26:51.804
into thinking that they're going to be clean

692
00:26:51.804 --> 00:26:53.504
when they're done with this, and all they're doing

693
00:26:53.504 --> 00:26:57.616
is just using these bulk fiber supplements

694
00:26:57.926 --> 00:27:00.726
that are very poorly manufactured.

695
00:27:00.726 --> 00:27:03.647
<v Regina>Huge education for the public at large,</v>

696
00:27:03.647 --> 00:27:07.804
because of the nature of the advertising industry,

697
00:27:07.804 --> 00:27:10.064
but also the nature of the pharmaceutical industry,

698
00:27:10.064 --> 00:27:12.793
which now often owns some of these labels.

699
00:27:13.284 --> 00:27:14.924
So it's getting pretty complex.

700
00:27:14.924 --> 00:27:16.484
It's getting difficult to tell the truth.

701
00:27:16.484 --> 00:27:17.804
Thank god there are people out there

702
00:27:17.804 --> 00:27:19.863
who are clearly passionate about it,

703
00:27:19.863 --> 00:27:22.704
such as yourself, and also getting new product

704
00:27:22.704 --> 00:27:25.182
that's actually going to work out there.

705
00:27:25.182 --> 00:27:27.882
But it is, we're fighting against an awful

706
00:27:27.882 --> 00:27:30.832
lot of misinformation and disinformation.

707
00:27:30.922 --> 00:27:33.502
<v ->Exactly, that's the reason why we wanted to develop</v>

708
00:27:33.502 --> 00:27:36.941
this product, so we can actually help heal people.

709
00:27:36.941 --> 00:27:38.082
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v Edward>I mean, we're not</v>

710
00:27:38.082 --> 00:27:40.542
good at, I don't want to promote a product

711
00:27:40.542 --> 00:27:42.842
or develop a product and give it to somebody

712
00:27:42.842 --> 00:27:46.242
that is not going to address the root cause

713
00:27:46.242 --> 00:27:47.782
of their symptoms to begin with.

714
00:27:47.782 --> 00:27:51.442
And yes, even though Oxy-Powder is the product

715
00:27:51.442 --> 00:27:54.552
we developed and they should be using that,

716
00:27:54.942 --> 00:27:58.642
I still promote them to not have to use that,

717
00:27:58.642 --> 00:28:01.282
which is exactly what I tell them to do.

718
00:28:01.282 --> 00:28:03.621
This is what is causing your problems,

719
00:28:03.621 --> 00:28:05.962
this is what you need to do to fix the problems.

720
00:28:05.962 --> 00:28:09.536
If you choose to

721
00:28:09.536 --> 00:28:11.936
expose yourself to these daily toxins from food,

722
00:28:11.936 --> 00:28:14.136
air, everything all day long every day,

723
00:28:14.136 --> 00:28:16.976
then the least you can do is to clean your--

724
00:28:16.976 --> 00:28:19.336
you have to no matter what, clean your intestines.

725
00:28:19.336 --> 00:28:22.096
Unless you're living so pure, you have to clean

726
00:28:22.096 --> 00:28:23.796
your intestines twice a week.

727
00:28:23.796 --> 00:28:25.496
It's not like a liver and gallbladder cleanse

728
00:28:25.496 --> 00:28:27.675
you do every six months, or do everything.

729
00:28:27.675 --> 00:28:31.956
What is--your intestines are 24 hours a day,

730
00:28:31.956 --> 00:28:34.606
seven days a week, exposed to toxins.

731
00:28:34.876 --> 00:28:38.316
Unless you closed your nose, closed your mouth,

732
00:28:38.316 --> 00:28:40.475
and didn't eat or didn't breathe,

733
00:28:40.475 --> 00:28:43.045
then your intestines wouldn't be exposed to toxins.

734
00:28:43.256 --> 00:28:46.156
So I mean, if you're breathing in

735
00:28:46.156 --> 00:28:49.946
a million toxins, if you have a million toxins a day,

736
00:28:50.256 --> 00:28:52.236
200,000 from air, 200,000 from food,

737
00:28:52.236 --> 00:28:53.376
200,000 from (mumbles)

738
00:28:53.376 --> 00:28:55.456
you have a million toxins a day,

739
00:28:55.456 --> 00:28:58.566
and the first line of attack is your intestines.

740
00:28:59.616 --> 00:29:01.436
Don't you think that you need to at least

741
00:29:01.436 --> 00:29:03.666
cleanse that at least twice a week?

742
00:29:04.336 --> 00:29:07.306
So I mean, that's the reason that

743
00:29:08.136 --> 00:29:09.876
we've had so much success.

744
00:29:09.876 --> 00:29:11.216
Oxy-Powder's been on the market

745
00:29:11.216 --> 00:29:14.226
for probably 10, at least 10 years.

746
00:29:14.616 --> 00:29:17.174
Not one person out of thousands, hundred of thousands

747
00:29:17.174 --> 00:29:18.914
of people around the world, not one person

748
00:29:18.914 --> 00:29:22.004
has ever wrote us back and said they've got colon cancer.

749
00:29:22.612 --> 00:29:24.590
<v Regina>And it's so true, because not only is that</v>

750
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:27.809
your line of defense for your entire immune system,

751
00:29:27.809 --> 00:29:30.360
but that is a very vulnerable part of the body

752
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.708
in terms of contracting or creating a cancerous

753
00:29:33.708 --> 00:29:35.688
condition to begin with.

754
00:29:35.688 --> 00:29:38.208
Lots of intestinal types of cancers,

755
00:29:38.208 --> 00:29:40.588
colon cancers out there.
<v Edward>Yeah, it's crazy.</v>

756
00:29:40.588 --> 00:29:42.208
<v Regina>So this is a really key thing to do</v>

757
00:29:42.208 --> 00:29:44.488
in order to put that one at bay.

758
00:29:44.488 --> 00:29:47.068
Now, (clears throat) I have a question I wanted to ask you.

759
00:29:47.068 --> 00:29:48.948
We're both at high altitude here in Santa Fe

760
00:29:48.948 --> 00:29:51.238
and with scratchy throats.
(Edward chuckles)

761
00:29:51.238 --> 00:29:54.056
I want to go right into the final part,

762
00:29:54.056 --> 00:29:56.896
because I'll encourage everyone, go to your website.

763
00:29:57.214 --> 00:29:59.154
What's the name of the book again?

764
00:30:00.364 --> 00:30:02.514
<v ->The name of the book is Health Begins in the Colon.</v>

765
00:30:02.514 --> 00:30:03.594
<v Regina>Right. Okay, good.</v>

766
00:30:03.594 --> 00:30:06.327
So we'll definitely recommend that.

767
00:30:07.257 --> 00:30:09.935
I want to go to the effects on another level.

768
00:30:09.935 --> 00:30:13.045
I'd like to take the subject of toxins even deeper.

769
00:30:13.135 --> 00:30:14.875
Most everybody watching this is looking

770
00:30:14.875 --> 00:30:16.795
for a deeper connection with self,

771
00:30:16.795 --> 00:30:19.435
and with the spirit force that permeates everything

772
00:30:19.435 --> 00:30:21.555
with love, with the cosmic love,

773
00:30:21.555 --> 00:30:23.435
and the universal mind.

774
00:30:23.435 --> 00:30:26.215
That connection,

775
00:30:26.215 --> 00:30:29.255
you say, is dampened

776
00:30:29.255 --> 00:30:31.775
through toxicity on a cellular level.

777
00:30:31.775 --> 00:30:34.405
That's not good. Can you please expand on that?

778
00:30:35.355 --> 00:30:38.095
<v ->Because in order to achieve the enlightenment,</v>

779
00:30:38.095 --> 00:30:40.215
you need to have everything working in unison,

780
00:30:40.215 --> 00:30:42.095
and you have to have--

781
00:30:42.095 --> 00:30:44.975
you have to be able to calm the mind,

782
00:30:44.975 --> 00:30:47.075
and you have to be able to connect

783
00:30:47.075 --> 00:30:50.203
to the higher intelligence or connect with your

784
00:30:50.543 --> 00:30:53.313
higher self, or connect with the universal consciousness

785
00:30:53.313 --> 00:30:55.329
or connect with the sound current, or connect

786
00:30:55.329 --> 00:30:57.089
with whatever you want to call it.

787
00:30:57.089 --> 00:31:00.439
In order to connect, your cells have to be functioning

788
00:31:00.829 --> 00:31:03.219
at an optimum rate.

789
00:31:04.687 --> 00:31:07.657
If all of your cells, in order to achieve

790
00:31:08.047 --> 00:31:11.187
leaving the body, like the masters say,

791
00:31:11.187 --> 00:31:13.487
you have the ability to do anything.

792
00:31:13.487 --> 00:31:15.247
The Kingdom of Heaven is within.

793
00:31:15.247 --> 00:31:17.405
You can go within and experience anything.

794
00:31:17.883 --> 00:31:19.963
Well, how are you gonna calm your mind

795
00:31:19.963 --> 00:31:21.743
if you're depressed because of all the toxins

796
00:31:21.743 --> 00:31:23.163
that you've been faced with?

797
00:31:23.163 --> 00:31:24.925
How are you gonna calm your mind if you're not happy

798
00:31:24.925 --> 00:31:26.784
with yourself because you think you're overweight?

799
00:31:26.784 --> 00:31:29.252
Or how are you going to--you know the little things

800
00:31:29.252 --> 00:31:32.492
that toxins, the little things that having

801
00:31:32.492 --> 00:31:35.492
so much toxins in the body, how this leads to this,

802
00:31:35.492 --> 00:31:37.492
how this leads to this, and how this leads to this,

803
00:31:37.492 --> 00:31:39.632
so it's kind of like a snowball effect.

804
00:31:39.632 --> 00:31:42.912
That is why all the great masters over time

805
00:31:42.912 --> 00:31:46.052
recommend a strict vegetarian diet,

806
00:31:46.052 --> 00:31:50.252
they recommend being in a clean environment,

807
00:31:50.252 --> 00:31:53.053
working on yourself, because that's how

808
00:31:53.053 --> 00:31:57.363
you are able to achieve further enlightenment.

809
00:31:57.953 --> 00:32:00.343
Let's say you're in meditation

810
00:32:00.713 --> 00:32:02.433
and you're meditating and you're focusing

811
00:32:02.433 --> 00:32:04.843
and you're trying to go within.

812
00:32:06.073 --> 00:32:10.153
If in order to get to that state of enlightenment,

813
00:32:10.153 --> 00:32:13.573
which means all of the cells become light,

814
00:32:13.573 --> 00:32:15.113
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v Edward>in order for the</v>

815
00:32:15.113 --> 00:32:17.373
body to transform to that point to where

816
00:32:17.373 --> 00:32:20.973
all the cells become light, the cells have to,

817
00:32:20.973 --> 00:32:23.833
all of the water has to be in a crystalline structure,

818
00:32:23.833 --> 00:32:26.953
number one, which you can do with meditation.

819
00:32:26.953 --> 00:32:30.453
But if this cell, if it starts to go down

820
00:32:30.453 --> 00:32:32.153
and you're working your way up or down

821
00:32:32.153 --> 00:32:34.113
and this cell starts to become light,

822
00:32:34.113 --> 00:32:36.873
and you have toxic residue around this cell,

823
00:32:36.873 --> 00:32:39.533
and this cell--that's why it's so hard for people to--

824
00:32:39.533 --> 00:32:42.605
it takes so long for people to get to that level

825
00:32:42.605 --> 00:32:45.005
because you're slowly working and you're enlightening

826
00:32:45.005 --> 00:32:47.305
this cell and then the next cell's communicating

827
00:32:47.305 --> 00:32:50.445
with this cell saying, "Wow, something spiritual

828
00:32:50.445 --> 00:32:53.935
"is happening here, but the water

829
00:32:54.205 --> 00:32:57.065
"is broken up by the electromagnetic frequenies

830
00:32:57.065 --> 00:32:59.265
"because the cellphone tower's right over here,

831
00:32:59.265 --> 00:33:01.705
"so it's hard for me to transfer

832
00:33:01.705 --> 00:33:04.705
"that light signal from this cell to this cell."

833
00:33:04.705 --> 00:33:06.525
Plus you have metals around there,

834
00:33:06.525 --> 00:33:08.965
which are bouncing off, the signals are bouncing off.

835
00:33:08.965 --> 00:33:12.645
So eventually with practice, this cell goes to this cell,

836
00:33:12.645 --> 00:33:14.345
gets enlightened, and then this cell

837
00:33:14.345 --> 00:33:17.279
goes to that cell enlightened, but with enlightenment,

838
00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:19.540
or even when you start to get enlightened,

839
00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.820
you start getting the answers too.

840
00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:23.960
So as you start getting the answers,

841
00:33:24.923 --> 00:33:26.583
you start becoming a calmer person,

842
00:33:26.583 --> 00:33:28.017
which you're decreasing the toxins

843
00:33:28.017 --> 00:33:31.137
from your belief systems and
<v Regina>On an emotional</v>

844
00:33:31.137 --> 00:33:32.337
level. Right.
<v Edward>emotional level.</v>

845
00:33:32.337 --> 00:33:33.657
<v Regina>And Bruce Lipton--</v>
<v ->Edward] You start finding</v>

846
00:33:33.657 --> 00:33:35.558
out exactly more about yourself.

847
00:33:35.558 --> 00:33:38.707
You start finding out how much more--

848
00:33:39.538 --> 00:33:40.985
how better you're gonna feel,

849
00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:42.858
how healthy you're gonna feel.

850
00:33:42.858 --> 00:33:46.305
But what I've associated directly with

851
00:33:46.305 --> 00:33:48.524
is again, the water.

852
00:33:48.524 --> 00:33:52.014
Water is the key for you to achieve

853
00:33:52.085 --> 00:33:56.264
complete silence, meditation and spiritual bliss,

854
00:33:56.264 --> 00:33:58.744
because the water has to line up

855
00:33:58.744 --> 00:34:02.284
in all crystalline structure for you to really

856
00:34:02.284 --> 00:34:05.824
get to that point, and if the water is contaminated

857
00:34:06.451 --> 00:34:09.172
we cannot--oxygen--
<v Regina>And you're talking</v>

858
00:34:09.172 --> 00:34:11.211
about the fluid and waters in our own body,

859
00:34:11.211 --> 00:34:12.491
with contaminants.
<v Edward>Talking about</v>

860
00:34:12.491 --> 00:34:13.672
the fluid waters in your own body,

861
00:34:13.672 --> 00:34:14.831
because that's how the
<v Regina>Right.</v>

862
00:34:14.831 --> 00:34:16.332
<v ->cellular cells communicate.</v>

863
00:34:16.332 --> 00:34:18.392
I mean sure, there's an innate,

864
00:34:18.813 --> 00:34:21.213
in our conscious physical body,

865
00:34:21.213 --> 00:34:22.992
there's the water that I'm talking about.

866
00:34:22.992 --> 00:34:25.152
Sure, we can get to the point where our cells

867
00:34:25.152 --> 00:34:27.532
can communicate with each other outside of this body.

868
00:34:27.532 --> 00:34:29.712
I mean, we're, you know.

869
00:34:29.712 --> 00:34:32.521
There is no past, future, present or anything.

870
00:34:32.521 --> 00:34:33.880
We're just there, one.

871
00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.541
We're just in this physical body so we can experience

872
00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:39.340
touch and sound--that's the privilege

873
00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:41.441
we get to be able to experience

874
00:34:41.441 --> 00:34:44.620
what touch and feel and sight and everything is,

875
00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.281
but the powers to be.

876
00:34:46.281 --> 00:34:48.867
That's why there was pieces of the Bible taken out

877
00:34:48.867 --> 00:34:51.107
that show us how to go in and how to achieve that

878
00:34:51.107 --> 00:34:53.546
and how to have that power within.

879
00:34:53.546 --> 00:34:55.107
I mean like Jesus, we can do anything,

880
00:34:55.107 --> 00:34:56.887
you can do anything I can do.

881
00:34:56.887 --> 00:34:58.087
That's the way it is.

882
00:34:58.087 --> 00:35:01.951
We all are a part of the One Source, or God, or whatever

883
00:35:01.951 --> 00:35:03.801
you want to call it.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

884
00:35:04.691 --> 00:35:07.390
<v ->We've had other sources, though,</v>

885
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:10.251
trying to restrict us from finding out

886
00:35:10.251 --> 00:35:13.621
about that, and that comes with the mind

887
00:35:13.931 --> 00:35:16.560
and being able to manipulate the mind

888
00:35:16.731 --> 00:35:19.251
to keep us from getting to that level.

889
00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:21.871
The powers that want to control this world

890
00:35:21.871 --> 00:35:24.051
don't want us to learn about spirituality

891
00:35:24.051 --> 00:35:25.911
and don't want us to learn about toxins.

892
00:35:25.911 --> 00:35:27.731
That's their whole goal.

893
00:35:27.731 --> 00:35:31.450
Keep poisoning the air, keep poisoning the food,

894
00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:32.991
keep poisoning the water.

895
00:35:32.991 --> 00:35:35.091
Arsenic is in every single water supply

896
00:35:35.091 --> 00:35:37.041
in the whole United States.

897
00:35:37.591 --> 00:35:40.498
They know that the metals in those type of--

898
00:35:40.498 --> 00:35:43.138
even radioactive materials are going to cause--

899
00:35:43.138 --> 00:35:45.138
keep us, they're just trying to suppress us

900
00:35:45.138 --> 00:35:49.177
and to keep us from finding that light

901
00:35:49.177 --> 00:35:51.006
of when we are toxin-free

902
00:35:51.006 --> 00:35:52.865
or when we're close to toxin-free,

903
00:35:52.865 --> 00:35:55.196
and that's when we open up spiritually.

904
00:35:56.426 --> 00:35:58.814
<v Regina>Well, we're going to end it</v>

905
00:35:58.814 --> 00:36:01.054
on that note because that pretty much says it

906
00:36:01.054 --> 00:36:03.793
right there, and you are emanating lots of light

907
00:36:03.793 --> 00:36:06.614
on many levels, even now to your cheeks.

908
00:36:06.614 --> 00:36:08.764
So... (laughs)

909
00:36:08.993 --> 00:36:10.534
I think you are an indigo kid.

910
00:36:10.534 --> 00:36:13.164
But anyway, you have--
(Edward chuckles)

911
00:36:14.042 --> 00:36:15.122
we could take for days.

912
00:36:15.122 --> 00:36:16.762
You have massive amounts of information

913
00:36:16.762 --> 00:36:19.129
on many other levels multi-dimensionally

914
00:36:19.129 --> 00:36:21.710
as well as physically, and thank you so much

915
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:23.990
for taking a litlte bit of time to stop by here

916
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:25.698
before you catch your plane.

917
00:36:25.698 --> 00:36:27.298
We'll make sure that everybody has a chance

918
00:36:27.298 --> 00:36:28.918
to go to your website and check out what you do

919
00:36:28.918 --> 00:36:30.518
and your products and so forth.

920
00:36:30.518 --> 00:36:31.458
Thank you again.

921
00:36:31.458 --> 00:36:33.247
<v ->Thank you. Thanks for having me.</v>

922
00:36:33.878 --> 00:36:35.078
<v ->If you enjoyed this interview,</v>

at ghchealth.com.

925
00:36:38.997 --> 00:36:41.377

926
00:36:41.377 --> 00:36:43.518
on a myriad of subjects related to healing

927
00:36:43.518 --> 00:36:46.998
from digestive issues to infertility and much more.

928
00:36:46.998 --> 00:36:49.618
One more note, his Oxy-Powder is the best product

929
00:36:49.618 --> 00:36:52.697
in its class I have ever experienced, bar none.

930
00:36:52.697 --> 00:36:54.638
