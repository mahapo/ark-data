(tranquil music)

2
00:00:14.988 --> 00:00:17.648
<v ->We all talk a big game about coming from the heart</v>

3
00:00:17.648 --> 00:00:19.768
but what does that actually mean?

4
00:00:19.768 --> 00:00:22.968
According to Howard Martin, of the HeartMath Institute,

5
00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:24.768
it means that we're both learning to listen

6
00:00:24.768 --> 00:00:26.888
to the whisper of the heart and learning

7
00:00:26.888 --> 00:00:29.928
to come into a mental, emotional and biological state

8
00:00:29.928 --> 00:00:32.888
of coherence which feels much like peace.

9
00:00:32.888 --> 00:00:35.808
Not only does this coherence change the course of our lives,

10
00:00:35.808 --> 00:00:38.778
it may even change the course of the planet.

11
00:00:41.288 --> 00:00:42.586
Thank you for inviting us up here.

12
00:00:42.586 --> 00:00:45.266
If you can't find coherence in this environment

13
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.966
I don't where you could.

14
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.286
Nice choice.

15
00:00:48.286 --> 00:00:49.106
<v ->Thanks.</v>

16
00:00:49.106 --> 00:00:50.366
This is definitely a heartfelt environment.

17
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:51.806
The land itself is conditioned to that

18
00:00:51.806 --> 00:00:53.206
and we've been here 27 years.

19
00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:56.386
So a lot of love has been put out in this place

20
00:00:56.386 --> 00:00:58.006
for a long time and it makes me feel good

21
00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:00.026
if people want me to show up.

22
00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.726
<v Voiceover>I mean, we're just taking a moment or two</v>

23
00:01:01.726 --> 00:01:04.866
to meditate before we let the camera start rolling.

24
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.446
And as I said, I could just kind of stay there all day

25
00:01:07.446 --> 00:01:09.956
and forget the talk (laughs).

26
00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:11.684
<v ->We could just do that instead, right?</v>

27
00:01:11.684 --> 00:01:12.504
<v ->There you go.</v>

28
00:01:12.504 --> 00:01:15.644
It might be a little dull for our viewers.

29
00:01:15.644 --> 00:01:18.062
You've done hundreds, if not, thousands of interviews,

30
00:01:18.062 --> 00:01:21.402
nonetheless, we're starting fresh every time

31
00:01:21.402 --> 00:01:23.002
and I wanna know about HeartMath.

32
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:26.042
And so I would like to go back to why,

33
00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:29.722
would you chose into heart coherence say

34
00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:32.322
versus brain coherence when at that time

35
00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:35.482
there was so much going on with neurofeedback, for example.

36
00:01:35.482 --> 00:01:38.042
And everybody was looking at the coherence of the brain

37
00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:40.762
but you slid in underneath that to go

38
00:01:40.762 --> 00:01:42.690
to something more essential.

39
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.360
<v ->Well it came from our own personal experience</v>

40
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.020
before we ever had science or anything to validate

41
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.620
going back now 47 years with myself,

42
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.440
Doc Childre and others all the way back to North Carolina

43
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.200
when we first started out and we were just young people

44
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.920
who were interested in how we improve ourselves,

45
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.220
how do we expand consciousness.

46
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.680
We've read about these things in books

47
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.740
but how do you do that.

48
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.340
And it was Doc really that kept bringing it back

49
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.180
to more of a heart-centric approach,

50
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.160
but what was different about it was that

51
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.420
he wasn't talking about heart

52
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.040
in the same context necessarily

53
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.638
that I'd heard about it before

54
00:02:14.638 --> 00:02:17.018
which is mostly sort of philosophical or spiritual.

55
00:02:17.018 --> 00:02:20.058
But every pragmatic, grounded in this approach to it

56
00:02:20.058 --> 00:02:22.638
of focusing on things like really learn more

57
00:02:22.638 --> 00:02:24.258
about how to regulate our emotions

58
00:02:24.258 --> 00:02:26.838
and how to breakthrough some of the barriers

59
00:02:26.838 --> 00:02:28.298
and things that we had in our lives;

60
00:02:28.298 --> 00:02:29.938
and that place inside ourselves

61
00:02:29.938 --> 00:02:32.818
where we could go past our mediocrity,

62
00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:34.358
where we'd find that hero within

63
00:02:34.358 --> 00:02:37.798
that could really make a difference in how we lived.

64
00:02:37.798 --> 00:02:40.078
And working on things like taking out the ambitions

65
00:02:40.078 --> 00:02:42.648
and all that would be associated with a lot of things

66
00:02:42.648 --> 00:02:45.436
in making it much more of a consideration of the whole

67
00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:47.856
which would be characteristics of the heart.

68
00:02:47.856 --> 00:02:49.956
So our own experience led us to that understanding

69
00:02:49.956 --> 00:02:52.176
because our awareness did change

70
00:02:52.176 --> 00:02:54.516
and we did, I think, become better people.

71
00:02:54.516 --> 00:02:57.966
And certainly when we wanted to do HeartMath

72
00:02:57.966 --> 00:02:59.694
we didn't have a name for it back then,

73
00:02:59.694 --> 00:03:02.734
but basically our task at the time was to take

74
00:03:02.734 --> 00:03:04.610
what we've learned in these 15 years

75
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.550
of really being obscurity.

76
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.590
Without any ambition, having an organization

77
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.870
or to do anything like that, now that we decided to

78
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.630
what have we learned?

79
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.630
And what can we put into writings or books

80
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.310
or training programs or other things--

81
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.750
<v Voiceover>And how do you give it a scientific basis?</v>

82
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.410
<v ->Yeah, here's what we figured out.</v>

83
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.810
We figured out, "Okay, this is a heart-centric approach

84
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.230
"we've taken to this that we wanna share."

85
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.210
If we try to share a heart-centric approach now,

86
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.570
the same way it's been shared before,

87
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.270
we can get a predictable result, right?

88
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.190
<v Voiceover>Another religion.</v>

89
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.470
<v ->Another religion.</v>

90
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.034
Or this heart remains in the confines of spirituality

91
00:03:40.034 --> 00:03:41.274
and philosophy.

92
00:03:41.274 --> 00:03:43.434
So we wanted to use modern tools to give it

93
00:03:43.434 --> 00:03:45.514
the groundedness or empirical understanding

94
00:03:45.514 --> 00:03:49.094
that we felt it needed in the 20th and 21st century.

95
00:03:49.094 --> 00:03:51.534
A bridge builder between understanding and belief

96
00:03:51.534 --> 00:03:52.934
is science.

97
00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:56.054
And in our world today, science carries a heavy weight

98
00:03:56.054 --> 00:03:58.814
and science says there's a lot of belief.

99
00:03:58.814 --> 00:04:00.694
So we began the endeavor of looking at things

100
00:04:00.694 --> 00:04:02.674
to a scientific perspective.

101
00:04:02.674 --> 00:04:05.934
Never with the intention of taking the heart out of heart,

102
00:04:05.934 --> 00:04:08.314
but how do we give it some more understanding

103
00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:10.395
that is gonna give people a greater ability

104
00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:12.855
to believe in something they wanna believe in, I think,

105
00:04:12.855 --> 00:04:15.235
and that they already kind of know intuitively.

106
00:04:15.235 --> 00:04:18.315
How do we take that, I'll use a Doc Childre term,

107
00:04:18.315 --> 00:04:20.836
how do we take that from ska to street?

108
00:04:20.836 --> 00:04:22.976
And for the listeners and viewers today,

109
00:04:22.976 --> 00:04:25.196
Doc Childre is the founder of HeartMath

110
00:04:25.196 --> 00:04:26.876
and my friend now for over 40 years.

111
00:04:26.876 --> 00:04:29.509
But ska to street out of the philosophy,

112
00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.749
in the lofty spirituality down to how do we live this,

113
00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:34.737
how does this make a difference in our lives,

114
00:04:34.737 --> 00:04:36.937
in our relationships, in our work environments,

115
00:04:36.937 --> 00:04:39.057
in our health, those kind of things.

116
00:04:39.057 --> 00:04:42.877
<v Voiceover>And you're looking at another kind of axiom</v>

117
00:04:42.877 --> 00:04:45.297
from the ancient text that's always been at the heart

118
00:04:45.297 --> 00:04:46.237
is the seed of the soul.

119
00:04:46.237 --> 00:04:48.557
And you were just talking about this heroism

120
00:04:48.557 --> 00:04:50.777
that we find in ourselves, for example.

121
00:04:50.777 --> 00:04:54.657
So as you're moving into the understanding,

122
00:04:54.657 --> 00:04:57.118
starting to apply science now to your understanding

123
00:04:57.118 --> 00:05:02.118
of the heart and its impulses and how it can be utilized

124
00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:07.358
for finding that hero within, where does the soul,

125
00:05:07.358 --> 00:05:09.718
the notion of soul fit into it in,

126
00:05:09.718 --> 00:05:12.234
if you do fit it in in the scientific realm?

127
00:05:12.234 --> 00:05:14.253
<v ->Well, I think science is trying to understand that.</v>

128
00:05:14.253 --> 00:05:16.953
I think that if you look at the big wide mission

129
00:05:16.953 --> 00:05:19.813
of the HeartMath science and our scientists

130
00:05:19.813 --> 00:05:23.173
is to decode how spirit interfaces with humanness.

131
00:05:23.173 --> 00:05:26.522
And spirit could be an interchangeable word for soul,

132
00:05:26.522 --> 00:05:29.096
authentic self spirit, soul, universal source,

133
00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:30.656
those kind of terms for that.

134
00:05:30.656 --> 00:05:32.776
Something that's larger than our ordinariness,

135
00:05:32.776 --> 00:05:34.536
something that expands into consciousness

136
00:05:34.536 --> 00:05:37.556
that's not our day to day consciousness for the most part.

137
00:05:37.556 --> 00:05:40.656
And so my experience of that would be

138
00:05:40.656 --> 00:05:43.776
it is through your heart that spirit does merge

139
00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:45.176
within our humanness.

140
00:05:45.176 --> 00:05:47.896
It enters me through the heart.

141
00:05:47.896 --> 00:05:50.696
It's transmitted at super high speed into the brain

142
00:05:50.696 --> 00:05:52.676
where it takes on thoughts and impressions

143
00:05:52.676 --> 00:05:53.856
and things like that.

144
00:05:53.856 --> 00:05:56.976
So it's very easy for it to be construed

145
00:05:56.976 --> 00:06:00.556
that it's a brain thing or a mind thing.

146
00:06:00.556 --> 00:06:01.676
And it all works together,

147
00:06:01.676 --> 00:06:03.116
there's no competition going on here.

148
00:06:03.116 --> 00:06:06.456
But to me the entry point is really at the level of heart.

149
00:06:06.456 --> 00:06:09.216
And when I'm in those heart related states,

150
00:06:09.216 --> 00:06:12.316
like in a more loving state or appreciative or compassionate

151
00:06:12.316 --> 00:06:15.536
that's when soul has a chance

152
00:06:15.536 --> 00:06:17.236
to have a shot at speaking to me.

153
00:06:17.236 --> 00:06:19.136
<v Voiceover>Exactly, you could feel it.</v>

154
00:06:19.136 --> 00:06:21.846
<v ->You can feel it and you're paying more attention then.</v>

155
00:06:21.846 --> 00:06:25.779
But the beginning point is what I do

156
00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:27.919
to generate more appreciation or care,

157
00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:29.419
or love or compassion.

158
00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:30.339
That's where it begins.

159
00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:32.759
And then from that point I have greater access to that

160
00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.099
that we call soul.

161
00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:37.619
<v Voiceover>And Leonard Laskow's work years ago</v>

162
00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:40.419
when he and Beverly were working together,

163
00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:42.339
I think out at Berkeley, and they were looking

164
00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:45.899
at the effect of love, of heartfelt intention

165
00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:48.009
on the cells of the body.

166
00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:51.660
At some point, did this kind of biological interface

167
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.700
play into it, was it from the beginning?

168
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.301
How does that play in?

169
00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:57.741
<v ->Well in the beginning when we came in the early '90s,</v>

170
00:06:57.741 --> 00:07:00.241
Leonard Laskow was one and he did some work in that area,

171
00:07:00.241 --> 00:07:02.641
but there was very little literature that was written

172
00:07:02.641 --> 00:07:04.361
around the positive emotional states--

173
00:07:04.361 --> 00:07:06.241
<v Voiceover>And he was working on love on cancer cells,</v>

174
00:07:06.241 --> 00:07:07.841
the effect on cancer cells just for someone

175
00:07:07.841 --> 00:07:09.041
who hasn't already--

176
00:07:09.041 --> 00:07:11.211
<v ->Little tiny pieces of research.</v>

177
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:14.062
The things we've accepted today about emotions impact

178
00:07:14.062 --> 00:07:16.062
on health and importance of positive emotions.

179
00:07:16.062 --> 00:07:19.082
This wasn't in the literature back then.

180
00:07:19.082 --> 00:07:21.002
All it had been on was negative emotions,

181
00:07:21.002 --> 00:07:22.942
anger kills and things like that.

182
00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.382
So it's understood that emotion had a negative impact

183
00:07:25.382 --> 00:07:27.482
if it was strong negative emotion

184
00:07:27.482 --> 00:07:29.802
but not much have been done the other way.

185
00:07:29.802 --> 00:07:31.642
We knew that was not true, we knew that there was

186
00:07:31.642 --> 00:07:35.742
a physiological effect in our bodies created by emotion.

187
00:07:35.742 --> 00:07:37.622
Every single thing that we feel

188
00:07:37.622 --> 00:07:40.262
has a biological response to it.

189
00:07:40.262 --> 00:07:42.842
For instance, if we're feeling joy and all of a sudden

190
00:07:42.842 --> 00:07:46.062
we feel anger there's about 1,400 biochemical changes

191
00:07:46.062 --> 00:07:47.922
that go off in our body instantaneously.

192
00:07:47.922 --> 00:07:49.702
Every time there's a big emotional shift

193
00:07:49.702 --> 00:07:52.542
there's like a huge amount of biochemical changes

194
00:07:52.542 --> 00:07:54.442
that occur instantaneously.

195
00:07:54.442 --> 00:07:56.742
We did some studies early on that are still very popular

196
00:07:56.742 --> 00:07:58.142
and interesting.

197
00:07:58.142 --> 00:08:01.542
Around things like the effects

198
00:08:01.542 --> 00:08:04.792
of emotions on an immune system component.

199
00:08:04.792 --> 00:08:08.323
The secretory IgA it's called, body's first line of defense

200
00:08:08.323 --> 00:08:11.163
against invading pathogens.

201
00:08:11.163 --> 00:08:14.423
We did a study years ago that we found a little tiny study

202
00:08:14.423 --> 00:08:16.943
that Dr. McClelland at Harvard had done

203
00:08:16.943 --> 00:08:19.683
where he showed people a Mother Teresa video

204
00:08:19.683 --> 00:08:21.463
and he measured pre and posts

205
00:08:21.463 --> 00:08:23.503
of this immune system component.

206
00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.943
And he saw that right after watching the Mother Teresa video

207
00:08:25.943 --> 00:08:29.583
which was an evocative video of her compassion

208
00:08:29.583 --> 00:08:32.634
that the IgA levels went up.

209
00:08:33.844 --> 00:08:35.024
That's as far as he took it.

210
00:08:35.024 --> 00:08:36.924
When our researchers found that they were looking

211
00:08:36.924 --> 00:08:37.924
for these kind of things, right?

212
00:08:37.924 --> 00:08:39.104
They wanted some validation.

213
00:08:39.104 --> 00:08:40.824
So they decided to do the same experiment

214
00:08:40.824 --> 00:08:41.684
but take it further.

215
00:08:41.684 --> 00:08:45.184
So what they did is send test subjects that they brought in

216
00:08:45.184 --> 00:08:50.084
one day and they measured the immune system marker level

217
00:08:50.084 --> 00:08:53.184
and then they asked them to experience five minutes of anger

218
00:08:53.184 --> 00:08:54.384
and then they measured it again.

219
00:08:54.384 --> 00:08:57.464
Well, when they measured it again it actually gone up.

220
00:08:57.464 --> 00:08:59.424
But they tracked it over at the next five hours,

221
00:08:59.424 --> 00:09:02.044
and what happened was an hour after that five-minute episode

222
00:09:02.044 --> 00:09:07.044
of trying to be angry it dropped to 100% below baseline.

223
00:09:07.084 --> 00:09:11.604
And slowly started to climb back up over the next five hours

224
00:09:11.604 --> 00:09:14.384
but never got back to baseline.

225
00:09:14.384 --> 00:09:17.584
A week later they brought the same test subjects back in,

226
00:09:17.584 --> 00:09:20.044
did the measurements again, got a baseline.

227
00:09:20.044 --> 00:09:21.105
They asked them to experience

228
00:09:21.105 --> 00:09:22.665
five minutes of care this time.

229
00:09:22.665 --> 00:09:25.845
Like try to care about something which they did.

230
00:09:25.845 --> 00:09:29.705
Big spike, dropped back to normal an hour later

231
00:09:29.705 --> 00:09:31.905
but not below but back to where it started

232
00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:34.005
and then steadily climbed throughout the rest of the day.

233
00:09:34.005 --> 00:09:35.365
<v Voiceover>Wasn't that interesting?</v>

234
00:09:35.365 --> 00:09:38.346
<v ->Yeah, the question it brings up is how much time</v>

235
00:09:38.346 --> 00:09:40.966
during the course of a day or a week or a month

236
00:09:40.966 --> 00:09:43.566
that we spend in emotions like frustration and anger

237
00:09:43.566 --> 00:09:46.646
and those kind of things versus really being caring

238
00:09:46.646 --> 00:09:48.686
or appreciative about things.

239
00:09:48.686 --> 00:09:50.946
The body's responding to every single thing we feel,

240
00:09:50.946 --> 00:09:52.326
moment to moment, day to day

241
00:09:52.326 --> 00:09:54.186
and emotions are so subtle and they shift

242
00:09:54.186 --> 00:09:56.566
and they flow at such a high speed.

243
00:09:56.566 --> 00:09:58.946
There's definitely an impact on our health.

244
00:09:58.946 --> 00:10:00.938
So that connection is something we have made.

245
00:10:03.296 --> 00:10:04.408
<v Voiceover>I'm sorry, go ahead.</v>

246
00:10:04.408 --> 00:10:06.068
<v ->I'm just saying there are other studies we've done as well</v>

247
00:10:06.068 --> 00:10:09.618
around that but to your earlier question,

248
00:10:09.618 --> 00:10:11.129
what's the biochemical part of this.

249
00:10:11.129 --> 00:10:13.449
Well, heart related emotions have been shown

250
00:10:13.449 --> 00:10:17.119
to produce biochemical changes that are beneficial,

251
00:10:17.119 --> 00:10:21.189
increases in things like DHEA which is engineerically called

252
00:10:21.189 --> 00:10:24.209
the anti-agent or vitality hormone, we did a study on that,

253
00:10:24.209 --> 00:10:26.849
and we can see the effects of these things.

254
00:10:26.849 --> 00:10:29.229
So it comes back to what are we really feeling

255
00:10:29.229 --> 00:10:32.009
at any moment at any given time.

256
00:10:32.009 --> 00:10:34.529
So HeartMath does a lot of things and our researchers

257
00:10:34.529 --> 00:10:37.561
have become a big bridge builder for us.

258
00:10:38.991 --> 00:10:43.391
Underneath all that, what is heart for?

259
00:10:43.391 --> 00:10:45.911
Well to me, one of the most important things it's for

260
00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:48.851
is learning how to better regulate or utilize

261
00:10:48.851 --> 00:10:51.392
this wonderful gift we have of emotion.

262
00:10:52.522 --> 00:10:56.342
<v Voiceover>In fact I was going to launch into that.</v>

263
00:10:56.342 --> 00:10:58.782
I've always been intrigued with the notion

264
00:10:58.782 --> 00:11:01.222
of is the mind the slave to the emotion

265
00:11:01.222 --> 00:11:03.542
or the emotion the slave to the mind

266
00:11:03.542 --> 00:11:05.022
which precedes the other.

267
00:11:05.022 --> 00:11:09.242
And I often will notice in life that first there is

268
00:11:09.242 --> 00:11:12.182
a notion, for example, or an exposure to,

269
00:11:12.182 --> 00:11:13.762
it doesn't matter if it's something visual,

270
00:11:13.762 --> 00:11:16.762
auditory or what not that the brain initially responds to

271
00:11:16.762 --> 00:11:19.462
or appears to be responding to that then starts

272
00:11:19.462 --> 00:11:22.802
a cascade of emotional reactions to it.

273
00:11:22.802 --> 00:11:26.562
So I mean, the mind, the mind is essentially the builder

274
00:11:26.562 --> 00:11:31.562
or the governor of the experience, yet at the same time,

275
00:11:31.862 --> 00:11:33.242
I don't know if you're aware of this,

276
00:11:33.242 --> 00:11:37.264
but James Barrett, do you know James?

277
00:11:37.264 --> 00:11:38.804
<v ->I don't know him personally but I know a little bit</v>

278
00:11:38.804 --> 00:11:39.704
about his work.

279
00:11:39.704 --> 00:11:42.424
<v Voiceover>He has a HeartMath device, right?</v>

280
00:11:42.424 --> 00:11:45.384
And so we were experimenting

281
00:11:45.384 --> 00:11:47.744
with a brain state technology device

282
00:11:47.744 --> 00:11:49.724
which is just another, one of the more advanced

283
00:11:49.724 --> 00:11:51.644
neurofeedback devices.

284
00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:56.164
And we had a woman who is very expressive emotionally

285
00:11:56.164 --> 00:11:58.904
hooked up to both at the same time.

286
00:11:58.904 --> 00:12:02.324
And then watched what happen as the various impetus

287
00:12:02.324 --> 00:12:04.784
that she would respond to came in.

288
00:12:04.784 --> 00:12:07.404
And this is just a little home experiment, okay,

289
00:12:07.404 --> 00:12:09.024
so you can't put much in it.

290
00:12:09.024 --> 00:12:13.284
But it was always the heart that was responding

291
00:12:13.284 --> 00:12:18.284
to the event just nanoseconds before the brain.

292
00:12:18.985 --> 00:12:20.305
<v ->I remember you telling me about that</v>

293
00:12:20.305 --> 00:12:22.425
when we met in Los Angeles about that study

294
00:12:22.425 --> 00:12:24.485
and that little experiment which they did

295
00:12:24.485 --> 00:12:26.105
was pretty interesting.

296
00:12:26.105 --> 00:12:29.005
Well, yeah, I think going back to sort of the original theme

297
00:12:29.005 --> 00:12:32.765
or dialogue in the last few minutes is that, yeah,

298
00:12:32.765 --> 00:12:34.045
I mean emotions are reactions.

299
00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:37.165
We react constantly to all the input that we get in

300
00:12:37.165 --> 00:12:39.505
so we have an emotional response to the input

301
00:12:39.505 --> 00:12:40.805
we get from light.

302
00:12:40.805 --> 00:12:42.605
I think what gets amiss in this is emotions

303
00:12:42.605 --> 00:12:44.205
are also choices.

304
00:12:44.205 --> 00:12:45.866
<v ->That's where the mind comes in, exactly.</v>

305
00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:47.907
<v ->We can choose emotions and especially we can choose</v>

306
00:12:47.907 --> 00:12:50.069
emotional responses.

307
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:51.509
"Wait a minute, this is upsetting me

308
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:52.669
"but I don't have to be upset.

309
00:12:52.669 --> 00:12:55.329
"I can be more balanced in calm place."

310
00:12:55.329 --> 00:12:57.129
Feeling of calm instead.

311
00:12:57.129 --> 00:12:58.789
That's an emotional choice.

312
00:12:58.789 --> 00:13:01.209
And I was in an interview a long time ago

313
00:13:01.209 --> 00:13:03.249
from a major network and the interviewer

314
00:13:03.249 --> 00:13:05.589
was a famous interviewer which we don't wanna name

315
00:13:05.589 --> 00:13:07.469
but when I got through the interview she came up to me

316
00:13:07.469 --> 00:13:09.629
and she said, "You said something in that interview

317
00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:12.049
"that shocked me and I've never thought about it before.

318
00:13:12.049 --> 00:13:13.489
"You said emotions were choices.

319
00:13:13.489 --> 00:13:14.669
"I never thought they were choices.

320
00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:17.809
"I always thought they were only reactions."

321
00:13:17.809 --> 00:13:19.889
<v ->And I think a lot of people believe that.</v>

322
00:13:19.889 --> 00:13:22.030
Because we haven't been put to the test

323
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.390
to have to have any mastery over the emotion

324
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.730
because the human being seems to be so addicted

325
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.850
to our fabulous emotional capacities

326
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:33.410
which are incapacitating to a large extent.

327
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.350
<v ->Yeah, that's true.</v>

328
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.850
And I think that one of the highest states of consciousness

329
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.530
we could ever have would be to be able

330
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.670
to feel like we wanna feel when we wanna feel that way.

331
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.490
And that's regulation of our emotions,

332
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.310
utilization of our gift in making choices

333
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.931
that put us in a place to feel what we wanna feel.

334
00:13:49.931 --> 00:13:51.851
That's the highest state of consciousness.

335
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:54.551
Well, just basically logical linear intelligence

336
00:13:54.551 --> 00:13:56.031
can't get that done.

337
00:13:56.031 --> 00:13:58.151
It takes an intelligence that can embrace the emotions

338
00:13:58.151 --> 00:14:00.131
that works at a faster speed.

339
00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:02.171
And that's what we call here at HeartMath

340
00:14:02.171 --> 00:14:04.351
"Heart Intelligence" comes into play.

341
00:14:04.351 --> 00:14:07.012
People can wonder what a Heart Intelligence is

342
00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:08.592
or what (mumbles).

343
00:14:08.592 --> 00:14:10.832
I take it right to the street.

344
00:14:10.832 --> 00:14:13.332
It's a way that you can regulate your emotions

345
00:14:13.332 --> 00:14:15.433
and in doing so you can create a whole another level

346
00:14:15.433 --> 00:14:17.134
of fulfillment in your life as well as things

347
00:14:17.134 --> 00:14:18.954
like better health and all that.

348
00:14:18.954 --> 00:14:20.914
That's a utility of our intelligence.

349
00:14:20.914 --> 00:14:22.774
<v ->Yes, indeed and it's measurable,</v>

350
00:14:22.774 --> 00:14:24.214
and that's what's really neat about it.

351
00:14:24.214 --> 00:14:27.534
I was at some event in Tucson, I think,

352
00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:31.254
one of the IONS events and stopped by the HeartMath booth

353
00:14:31.254 --> 00:14:34.154
back then and got hooked up and did the little thing.

354
00:14:34.154 --> 00:14:36.054
And through our years of meditations and such

355
00:14:36.054 --> 00:14:39.214
it's really wonderful to be able to watch your own self

356
00:14:39.214 --> 00:14:42.134
coming into coherence as you make these choices

357
00:14:42.134 --> 00:14:43.634
that you're talking about.

358
00:14:43.634 --> 00:14:46.874
But not everybody starts at that level, nobody does really.

359
00:14:46.874 --> 00:14:50.174
You've had many years of mastery in this area and practice,

360
00:14:50.174 --> 00:14:51.574
I've had many years of meditation.

361
00:14:51.574 --> 00:14:54.814
But let's talk about someone now who's listening and saying,

362
00:14:54.814 --> 00:14:57.974
"I really need to start having some kind of control

363
00:14:57.974 --> 00:14:58.854
"over my emotions.

364
00:14:58.854 --> 00:15:00.614
"I'm taken down by everybody around me.

365
00:15:00.614 --> 00:15:01.755
"I'm empathic."

366
00:15:01.755 --> 00:15:04.515
Empath seem to be particularly vulnerable.

367
00:15:04.515 --> 00:15:08.176
Let's talk about where their journey with this would begin.

368
00:15:08.176 --> 00:15:09.756
<v ->Well, I think the journey, first of all,</v>

369
00:15:09.756 --> 00:15:13.536
is to learn to honor and respect the feelings you have

370
00:15:13.536 --> 00:15:16.056
from the heart more and not just write them off

371
00:15:16.056 --> 00:15:17.997
as sentimental or just an occasional thing.

372
00:15:17.997 --> 00:15:20.877
But to look at heart in the aspect of heart

373
00:15:20.877 --> 00:15:24.957
that people can sort of intuitively sense as important,

374
00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:27.077
as real, as tangible and not as something

375
00:15:27.077 --> 00:15:29.438
that's in the ethers out there but it's the real thing

376
00:15:29.438 --> 00:15:31.358
and being measured physiologically

377
00:15:31.358 --> 00:15:34.218
which is measured through our emWave technology,

378
00:15:34.218 --> 00:15:35.578
for example, which is what you talked about

379
00:15:35.578 --> 00:15:37.238
by being hooked up.

380
00:15:37.238 --> 00:15:39.538
That's the first step, to honor and respect your heart

381
00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:41.738
and the heart intelligence you have there.

382
00:15:41.738 --> 00:15:43.038
Then there are simple techniques:

383
00:15:43.038 --> 00:15:44.618
some of them at HeartMath, the other techniques

384
00:15:44.618 --> 00:15:48.218
that people have, heart's not exclusively ours by any means

385
00:15:48.218 --> 00:15:50.198
so there's things out there people can do.

386
00:15:50.198 --> 00:15:51.799
But you can practice very simple techniques

387
00:15:51.799 --> 00:15:54.699
that learn to help people regulate emotion.

388
00:15:54.699 --> 00:15:56.839
One of the simple ones we have is called

389
00:15:56.839 --> 00:15:59.739
the attitude breathing technique.

390
00:15:59.739 --> 00:16:01.039
Think about what is an attitude?

391
00:16:01.039 --> 00:16:03.719
Sometimes people, Regina, can't really even identify

392
00:16:03.719 --> 00:16:05.779
an emotion but they can identify an attitude,

393
00:16:05.779 --> 00:16:06.939
you know what I mean?

394
00:16:06.939 --> 00:16:09.039
Listen, I woke up with a bad attitude this morning.

395
00:16:09.039 --> 00:16:09.879
What was that?

396
00:16:09.879 --> 00:16:10.519
What was that like?

397
00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:12.979
Well, I felt a little frustrated, I felt a little anxious.

398
00:16:12.979 --> 00:16:14.760
<v Voiceover>Get on a freeway, you know what attitude is.</v>

399
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.061
<v ->I felt a little blue, you know what I mean?</v>

400
00:16:16.061 --> 00:16:17.261
You start naming the emotions

401
00:16:17.261 --> 00:16:18.603
but this little bundle of emotions

402
00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:21.224
creates this thing called bad attitude, right?

403
00:16:21.224 --> 00:16:23.365
So the way the technique works is pretty simple.

404
00:16:23.365 --> 00:16:27.045
The first step is to observe what you're actually feeling.

405
00:16:27.045 --> 00:16:29.045
Now, it's a hard step.

406
00:16:29.045 --> 00:16:30.945
And why would that be?

407
00:16:30.945 --> 00:16:34.105
It would be that way because emotions run undercurrent.

408
00:16:34.105 --> 00:16:35.645
They run fast.

409
00:16:35.645 --> 00:16:38.147
We have the conscious emotions and then

410
00:16:38.147 --> 00:16:40.468
for years the subconscious and emotions

411
00:16:40.468 --> 00:16:42.468
had been talked about.

412
00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:43.888
I have another classification called

413
00:16:43.888 --> 00:16:45.928
the subtlety conscious emotions,

414
00:16:45.928 --> 00:16:47.308
the ones that are always running

415
00:16:47.308 --> 00:16:49.208
but we're just not paying any attention.

416
00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:51.128
We're running through life at a super high speed

417
00:16:51.128 --> 00:16:52.608
and mind stimulation and all that.

418
00:16:52.608 --> 00:16:54.888
We're not paying attention to this river of emotions

419
00:16:54.888 --> 00:16:56.769
flowing under consciousness.

420
00:16:56.769 --> 00:16:58.609
If we slow down just long enough and ask a question,

421
00:16:58.609 --> 00:17:01.049
"What am I feeling right now?"

422
00:17:01.049 --> 00:17:02.349
You just start catching on of the things

423
00:17:02.349 --> 00:17:04.959
that we maybe feeling.

424
00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:07.549
Once you've identified that, if you've identified it

425
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:09.309
you're feeling something you don't like

426
00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:13.229
then you choose a replacement emotion or attitude for it.

427
00:17:13.229 --> 00:17:14.789
Let's say, "I'm feeling nervous

428
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:16.269
"because I have to do an interview.

429
00:17:17.472 --> 00:17:19.424
"I need to feel calm instead."

430
00:17:21.434 --> 00:17:25.075
A replacement for what nervous might be.

431
00:17:25.075 --> 00:17:27.815
So let's say in this case I choose calm,

432
00:17:27.815 --> 00:17:30.335
or peace or something like that, I'll stay calm.

433
00:17:30.335 --> 00:17:32.555
And then what I wanna do is focus in the area of my heart,

434
00:17:32.555 --> 00:17:35.055
just bring my attention to that area.

435
00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:37.355
And then I wanna breath naturally, normally,

436
00:17:37.355 --> 00:17:39.295
but a little deeper than I normally would,

437
00:17:39.295 --> 00:17:41.695
and I wanna try to breath the feeling as best I can

438
00:17:41.695 --> 00:17:46.695
of calm, just calm in, calm out.

439
00:17:47.135 --> 00:17:48.695
And just breathe it like that.

440
00:17:48.695 --> 00:17:51.295
Again a sense of just anchoring a little bit,

441
00:17:51.295 --> 00:17:54.235
it's integrating in a little bit so I can start feeling

442
00:17:54.235 --> 00:17:56.295
that feeling shift.

443
00:17:56.295 --> 00:17:58.955
So what I'm doing there is I've slowed down enough

444
00:17:58.955 --> 00:18:00.895
to figure out what I'm feeling.

445
00:18:00.895 --> 00:18:02.895
I've decided that one of the things that I'm feeling

446
00:18:02.895 --> 00:18:04.695
is not what I wanna feel.

447
00:18:04.695 --> 00:18:06.375
I'm choosing what I'd rather feel

448
00:18:06.375 --> 00:18:08.555
and then I'm breathing that feeling in and out

449
00:18:08.555 --> 00:18:10.475
through the area of the heart.

450
00:18:10.475 --> 00:18:12.035
That's a simple technique.

451
00:18:12.035 --> 00:18:13.215
And there are others.

452
00:18:13.215 --> 00:18:14.695
But if we practice these kind of techniques

453
00:18:14.695 --> 00:18:17.975
what happens is we begin to reprogram ourselves.

454
00:18:17.975 --> 00:18:20.755
A lot of the emotional responses we have are just habits

455
00:18:20.755 --> 00:18:23.515
or addictions, those certain things.

456
00:18:23.515 --> 00:18:26.515
And when we start replacing the ones that are negative

457
00:18:26.515 --> 00:18:28.875
for the ones that are positive what happens is

458
00:18:28.875 --> 00:18:33.075
the emotional appetite changes.

459
00:18:33.075 --> 00:18:33.875
<v Voiceover>I would think so.</v>

460
00:18:33.875 --> 00:18:34.980
It's not so out of control.

461
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.243
<v ->You don't wanna feel this way and so it just feels awkward</v>

462
00:18:37.243 --> 00:18:39.463
that you do feel upset, or angry or whatever

463
00:18:39.463 --> 00:18:42.863
and you wanna get back quicker so you move back quicker.

464
00:18:42.863 --> 00:18:44.943
We're all gonna have emotional triggers.

465
00:18:44.943 --> 00:18:46.363
Things are gonna come up for all of us,

466
00:18:46.363 --> 00:18:48.643
anybody who's watching, you, me.

467
00:18:48.643 --> 00:18:49.363
<v Voiceover>You bet.</v>

468
00:18:49.363 --> 00:18:50.523
<v ->All of us.</v>

469
00:18:50.523 --> 00:18:52.885
It's not a matter of whether we're gonna feel

470
00:18:52.885 --> 00:18:55.245
these emotions or not, we are.

471
00:18:55.245 --> 00:18:57.005
I think the real game that we need to play

472
00:18:57.005 --> 00:19:00.845
is how quickly do we return to the feelings and emotions

473
00:19:00.845 --> 00:19:03.765
that we know are accelerating us in consciousness,

474
00:19:03.765 --> 00:19:05.185
that are regenerating us,

475
00:19:05.185 --> 00:19:06.725
that are providing more fulfillment.

476
00:19:06.725 --> 00:19:08.485
Just a distance in time.

477
00:19:08.485 --> 00:19:10.485
I'll give myself as an example.

478
00:19:10.485 --> 00:19:12.485
It's one of my measuring sticks.

479
00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:14.725
Some of the same things that could've upset me

480
00:19:14.725 --> 00:19:18.325
for a week upset me for a day.

481
00:19:18.325 --> 00:19:21.065
Some of the things that used to upset me for a day,

482
00:19:21.065 --> 00:19:22.865
maybe upset me for an hour.

483
00:19:22.865 --> 00:19:24.665
Some of the things that used to upset me for an hour

484
00:19:24.665 --> 00:19:27.145
upset me for a matter of a few seconds.

485
00:19:27.145 --> 00:19:29.165
There's the growth that I'm after.

486
00:19:29.165 --> 00:19:30.125
<v Voiceover>That's huge.</v>

487
00:19:30.125 --> 00:19:32.602
And again, it's bringing in mental mastery

488
00:19:32.602 --> 00:19:33.922
with emotional mastery.

489
00:19:33.922 --> 00:19:35.882
But you just said another thing a moment ago

490
00:19:35.882 --> 00:19:40.822
and this is something a lot of people ask about

491
00:19:40.822 --> 00:19:44.242
and that is what's the difference between emotions

492
00:19:44.242 --> 00:19:45.572
and feelings.

493
00:19:46.342 --> 00:19:47.982
<v ->I think it's mostly definition.</v>

494
00:19:47.982 --> 00:19:50.922
The way I look at it is that emotion is an energy,

495
00:19:50.922 --> 00:19:53.362
it's neutral, it's running through our system all the time.

496
00:19:53.362 --> 00:19:55.186
Where it picks its charge up from

497
00:19:55.186 --> 00:19:58.347
determines what kind of feeling that it is.

498
00:19:58.347 --> 00:20:00.067
And so it's all about perception.

499
00:20:00.067 --> 00:20:02.987
You have river of emotion that's constantly circulating

500
00:20:02.987 --> 00:20:04.307
that's an energy.

501
00:20:04.307 --> 00:20:07.387
And it's a matter of what feeling

502
00:20:07.387 --> 00:20:10.087
does that emotional energy become.

503
00:20:10.087 --> 00:20:13.067
If we're perceiving that, "Hey, life is tough right now,"

504
00:20:13.067 --> 00:20:15.327
then we get those kind of emotions back;

505
00:20:15.327 --> 00:20:16.967
for perceiving that life's really okay

506
00:20:16.967 --> 00:20:18.507
we get a different kind of emotions

507
00:20:18.507 --> 00:20:19.727
or feelings that come back.

508
00:20:19.727 --> 00:20:22.247
The emotional energy converts itself into feelings.

509
00:20:22.247 --> 00:20:23.727
I think it's really--

510
00:20:23.727 --> 00:20:25.467
<v Voiceover>You think it's more semantics than anything?</v>

511
00:20:25.467 --> 00:20:27.627
<v ->I think it is something to a fault,</v>

512
00:20:27.627 --> 00:20:30.527
I interchanged those words and I probably shouldn't

513
00:20:30.527 --> 00:20:32.667
but I think it's really a matter of semantics.

514
00:20:32.667 --> 00:20:35.507
I think a viewer or most people can be quite amiss

515
00:20:35.507 --> 00:20:37.607
in the same thing they kinda get intuitively

516
00:20:37.607 --> 00:20:40.207
or a sense that emotions and feelings.

517
00:20:40.207 --> 00:20:42.607
It's what you're feeling inside, right?

518
00:20:42.607 --> 00:20:44.367
<v ->I asked you think because, also a moment ago,</v>

519
00:20:44.367 --> 00:20:46.487
you were talking about we have an intuitive

520
00:20:46.487 --> 00:20:47.947
kind of feeling about it.

521
00:20:47.947 --> 00:20:51.487
And to me there's this other subtle thing

522
00:20:51.487 --> 00:20:54.207
that happens with the heart.

523
00:20:54.207 --> 00:20:57.208
And there is a kind of information that flows through

524
00:20:57.208 --> 00:20:59.028
that becomes really more of a feeling

525
00:20:59.028 --> 00:21:03.368
before it becomes a pattern or picture understanding

526
00:21:03.368 --> 00:21:05.928
that's subtle and non-emotional in nature

527
00:21:05.928 --> 00:21:08.748
and that kind of feeling, it's almost visceral

528
00:21:08.748 --> 00:21:12.228
or uplifting or maybe down draft to it,

529
00:21:12.228 --> 00:21:15.048
really seems to me to be the whisper of the heart.

530
00:21:15.048 --> 00:21:18.608
And that's why I was looking at that differentiation

531
00:21:18.608 --> 00:21:20.928
between subtle feeling and emotion.

532
00:21:20.928 --> 00:21:21.968
<v ->Well I think you've described it well.</v>

533
00:21:21.968 --> 00:21:24.088
You painted a beautiful picture of what I call

534
00:21:24.088 --> 00:21:26.168
the voice of the heart.

535
00:21:26.168 --> 00:21:28.628
It is often, it doesn't manifest itself all the time

536
00:21:28.628 --> 00:21:31.188
in these clear cut thoughts or impressions,

537
00:21:31.188 --> 00:21:33.308
it's the feeling that we have inside.

538
00:21:33.308 --> 00:21:35.028
And that's one of the reasons we need to learn

539
00:21:35.028 --> 00:21:37.949
to attune to it more because that voice is softer

540
00:21:37.949 --> 00:21:40.389
than the roar of ambition and survival, right?

541
00:21:40.389 --> 00:21:42.369
So that is going on constantly.

542
00:21:42.369 --> 00:21:44.129
And the voice of the heart is there but it's subtle

543
00:21:44.129 --> 00:21:46.969
and it mostly manifest itself in a different way.

544
00:21:46.969 --> 00:21:49.689
I think that we do contact it.

545
00:21:49.689 --> 00:21:51.189
There's a couple of generic categories

546
00:21:51.189 --> 00:21:53.589
where we do make contact with it, everybody does.

547
00:21:53.589 --> 00:21:57.469
One would be when life has exceeded our expectations.

548
00:21:57.469 --> 00:22:00.789
And we feel just exuberance because life has gone better

549
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:02.009
than we thought it was gonna go

550
00:22:02.009 --> 00:22:04.209
and it's easy to feel those feelings in.

551
00:22:04.209 --> 00:22:06.469
The other time would be when life is tough.

552
00:22:06.469 --> 00:22:08.409
And when things get to a certain point,

553
00:22:08.409 --> 00:22:11.269
very often we begin to dig a little deeper.

554
00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:12.989
That's when people pull deeper and sad

555
00:22:12.989 --> 00:22:14.409
and they may meditate or pray

556
00:22:14.409 --> 00:22:15.829
or they take that walk in the woods

557
00:22:15.829 --> 00:22:18.409
and walk on the beach or they get in the car

558
00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:19.669
and they drive off into the night, right,

559
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:20.749
they're trying to figure out something.

560
00:22:20.749 --> 00:22:22.409
They're pulling deeper inside.

561
00:22:22.409 --> 00:22:26.489
And when that happens then the heart intelligence,

562
00:22:26.489 --> 00:22:28.429
the voice of the heart, usually is there

563
00:22:28.429 --> 00:22:30.329
and sort of like, "Hey, we've been waiting for you.

564
00:22:30.329 --> 00:22:32.909
"Here I am, your own best friend,

565
00:22:32.909 --> 00:22:36.089
"your source of self security is here now."

566
00:22:36.089 --> 00:22:38.149
And what happens is things begin to change

567
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:39.729
in the middle dialogue.

568
00:22:39.729 --> 00:22:41.409
I've had times when I may have said,

569
00:22:41.409 --> 00:22:44.149
"This is really a tough situation and don't know

570
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:45.249
"how am I gonna get through it."

571
00:22:45.249 --> 00:22:48.730
So there's no logical pattern that's showing up for me

572
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:50.069
exactly what to do.

573
00:22:50.069 --> 00:22:53.869
But in the next phrase I may hear inside would be,

574
00:22:53.869 --> 00:22:55.609
"But you know I've been through tough things before

575
00:22:55.609 --> 00:22:57.529
"and I'll find a way to get through this."

576
00:22:57.529 --> 00:22:58.690
<v Voiceover>And a calm comes.</v>

577
00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.931
<v ->And that's the voice of the heart saying,</v>

578
00:23:00.931 --> 00:23:01.891
"There'll be a way."

579
00:23:01.891 --> 00:23:03.351
You know what I mean, that self security

580
00:23:03.351 --> 00:23:04.711
starts to shine through.

581
00:23:04.711 --> 00:23:06.551
But you have to dig a little deeper to get there.

582
00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:09.351
Now with HeartMath, the systems that we put in place:

583
00:23:09.351 --> 00:23:11.851
the tools, the methods, the technology and all that

584
00:23:11.851 --> 00:23:13.791
are all designed to train us to where we do that

585
00:23:13.791 --> 00:23:16.491
sort of easy and naturally and it's not a big deal,

586
00:23:16.491 --> 00:23:17.991
it's like day we flow through life,

587
00:23:17.991 --> 00:23:19.111
the way we conduct business,

588
00:23:19.111 --> 00:23:20.472
the way we conduct conversations,

589
00:23:20.472 --> 00:23:22.272
the way we approach things.

590
00:23:22.272 --> 00:23:25.512
<v ->And that's where you would see those really smooth waves,</v>

591
00:23:25.512 --> 00:23:26.552
for example.

592
00:23:26.552 --> 00:23:27.872
<v ->You're talking about the emWave and--</v>

593
00:23:27.872 --> 00:23:28.812
<v Voiceover>The emWave.</v>

594
00:23:28.812 --> 00:23:30.872
<v ->emWave's measuring changes in our heart rhythms,</v>

595
00:23:30.872 --> 00:23:32.032
it's the science behind it.

596
00:23:32.032 --> 00:23:35.112
And heart rhythms are reflective of our emotional state

597
00:23:35.112 --> 00:23:37.952
so you can see changes in the heart rhythm pattern.

598
00:23:37.952 --> 00:23:41.212
And there's a computer-based version that you saw

599
00:23:41.212 --> 00:23:43.872
where you see it on the screen in this handheld device,

600
00:23:43.872 --> 00:23:46.512
this is the emWave portable.

601
00:23:46.512 --> 00:23:48.993
It has little ear sensor you can attach and

602
00:23:48.993 --> 00:23:52.073
the lights will change showing me the quality

603
00:23:52.073 --> 00:23:54.153
of my heart-brain communication.

604
00:23:54.153 --> 00:23:56.173
And those changes will be reflective

605
00:23:56.173 --> 00:23:58.153
of what it is I'm feeling.

606
00:23:58.153 --> 00:24:00.893
<v Voiceover>And how does that differ from biofeedback?</v>

607
00:24:00.893 --> 00:24:02.213
<v ->Biofeedback's all about brain.</v>

608
00:24:02.213 --> 00:24:04.773
It's for brain wave states that were identified

609
00:24:04.773 --> 00:24:06.273
a number of years ago.

610
00:24:06.273 --> 00:24:07.395
Joe Kamaya, who used to be

611
00:24:07.395 --> 00:24:08.853
on our scientific advisory boards,

612
00:24:08.853 --> 00:24:13.053
he's the guy that named this for brain wave states.

613
00:24:13.053 --> 00:24:15.353
Heart rate variability is the science of heart rhythms

614
00:24:15.353 --> 00:24:17.113
and it looks totally at heart, the changes

615
00:24:17.113 --> 00:24:18.553
that are occurring in the heart

616
00:24:18.553 --> 00:24:20.453
in terms of its rhythm and beating patters

617
00:24:20.453 --> 00:24:22.573
and the timing between the heartbeats.

618
00:24:22.573 --> 00:24:26.213
And it's the science that was created in the 1970s

619
00:24:26.213 --> 00:24:28.413
by Australian medical people,

620
00:24:28.413 --> 00:24:30.593
they were trying to find ways to determine

621
00:24:30.593 --> 00:24:32.933
the health of a baby in the womb.

622
00:24:32.933 --> 00:24:34.913
And they could see the changes in the heart rhythms

623
00:24:34.913 --> 00:24:36.933
and so that was its first application,

624
00:24:36.933 --> 00:24:39.973
then it expanded into looking at nervous system dynamics,

625
00:24:39.973 --> 00:24:41.933
and the health of the heart and all of that.

626
00:24:41.933 --> 00:24:46.693
And there was a big field of heart rate variability going on

627
00:24:46.693 --> 00:24:49.993
but very small in the context of cardiovascular health

628
00:24:49.993 --> 00:24:52.493
in medicine, in general.

629
00:24:53.934 --> 00:24:56.775
Rollin McCraty, our chief of research, telling me one time

630
00:24:56.775 --> 00:24:58.357
when we first started doing research

631
00:24:58.357 --> 00:25:00.957
they were looking at EKG signals and things like that,

632
00:25:00.957 --> 00:25:03.257
trying to decode some information there

633
00:25:03.257 --> 00:25:05.617
about heart-brain communication.

634
00:25:05.617 --> 00:25:09.497
And Doc told Rollin, "Don't look at the heartbeat,

635
00:25:09.497 --> 00:25:12.097
"look at the space between the heartbeats."

636
00:25:12.097 --> 00:25:13.297
And Rollin didn't know what that meant,

637
00:25:13.297 --> 00:25:14.777
so he began to look into it and he found out,

638
00:25:14.777 --> 00:25:15.877
"Well there's a science of this.

639
00:25:15.877 --> 00:25:17.377
"Looking at the space between heartbeats

640
00:25:17.377 --> 00:25:19.417
"called heart rate variability now."

641
00:25:19.417 --> 00:25:21.257
And so that's one of the things that our researchers

642
00:25:21.257 --> 00:25:22.917
became experts in.

643
00:25:22.917 --> 00:25:26.397
And they knew that things like movement, speech

644
00:25:26.397 --> 00:25:28.357
all that create changes in the heart rhythm,

645
00:25:28.357 --> 00:25:31.157
it has to be that way, it's supposed to be that way.

646
00:25:31.157 --> 00:25:33.417
The timing is supposed to change for the heart

647
00:25:33.417 --> 00:25:35.997
to do its job as a cardiovascular organ

648
00:25:35.997 --> 00:25:38.527
to pump the blood the way we need to pump.

649
00:25:39.637 --> 00:25:42.177
They didn't know that emotion affected it.

650
00:25:42.177 --> 00:25:42.757
Why?

651
00:25:42.757 --> 00:25:44.437
Because they never looked at it.

652
00:25:44.437 --> 00:25:46.277
And there's one of the pioneers

653
00:25:46.277 --> 00:25:49.297
of heart rate variability research,

654
00:25:49.297 --> 00:25:52.257
I was in dialogue with our researchers and he said,

655
00:25:52.257 --> 00:25:54.737
"Heart rate changes, heart rate variability changes

656
00:25:54.737 --> 00:25:56.437
"are totally involuntary.

657
00:25:56.437 --> 00:25:57.957
"We have no control over them."

658
00:25:57.957 --> 00:26:00.657
Our researchers have said, "You're wrong about that.

659
00:26:00.657 --> 00:26:02.178
"We know absolutely that you do."

660
00:26:02.178 --> 00:26:04.178
When he came here they hooked him up to heart rate,

661
00:26:04.178 --> 00:26:05.498
hooked one of our people up

662
00:26:05.498 --> 00:26:07.458
to heart rate variability equipment

663
00:26:07.458 --> 00:26:09.558
and that person began to change

664
00:26:09.558 --> 00:26:11.038
and modulate this heart rhythms

665
00:26:11.038 --> 00:26:12.438
from the jaggedy regular patterns,

666
00:26:12.438 --> 00:26:14.718
the one you described, those movements.

667
00:26:14.718 --> 00:26:15.778
And he was shocked and he said,

668
00:26:15.778 --> 00:26:16.598
"How you doing that?"

669
00:26:16.598 --> 00:26:18.678
And he said, "I'm changing emotional state.

670
00:26:18.678 --> 00:26:20.218
"I'm shifting from the normal feelings

671
00:26:20.218 --> 00:26:22.579
"into feelings of appreciation, care, love,"

672
00:26:22.579 --> 00:26:24.019
those kind of things and that's causing

673
00:26:24.019 --> 00:26:26.879
that sound wave-like heart rate variability pattern.

674
00:26:26.879 --> 00:26:31.819
As a result of that that particular doctor was responsible

675
00:26:31.819 --> 00:26:34.519
for getting our first published research

676
00:26:34.519 --> 00:26:36.543
in a measure managed dream journal,

677
00:26:36.543 --> 00:26:38.283
the American Journal of Cardiology,

678
00:26:38.283 --> 00:26:40.863
and it was because this particular person

679
00:26:40.863 --> 00:26:43.243
saw something he's never seen before

680
00:26:43.243 --> 00:26:45.003
and he was the expert on heart rate variability

681
00:26:45.003 --> 00:26:46.743
in the world at the time.

682
00:26:46.743 --> 00:26:48.163
But just because they didn't look

683
00:26:48.163 --> 00:26:49.543
and they didn't think about that--

684
00:26:49.543 --> 00:26:50.503
<v Voiceover>They were looking for something else</v>

685
00:26:50.503 --> 00:26:52.263
and so they're looking at it in different place.

686
00:26:52.263 --> 00:26:53.943
<v ->So once we understood that we recognize,</v>

687
00:26:53.943 --> 00:26:56.043
"Wow, this is some serious piece of research here

688
00:26:56.043 --> 00:26:59.080
"because now we can have a way of showing

689
00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.160
"the effect of emotion on the body

690
00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.660
"like we've never seen before."

691
00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.800
And by learning how to change heart rhythms

692
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.280
we can train people to do that, we can change everything.

693
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.480
We can change the physiology,

694
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.520
we change the quality of heart-brain communication

695
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.160
which in turn changes consciousness and awareness

696
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.220
and all these things.

697
00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:16.440
<v Voiceover>It changes immune system.</v>

698
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.300
<v ->All of it.</v>

699
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.021
So we go back to the old phrase that's been around

700
00:27:19.021 --> 00:27:20.681
for a long, long time; the change of heart

701
00:27:20.681 --> 00:27:21.921
changes everything.

702
00:27:21.921 --> 00:27:24.061
And we can take that down now to a scientific level

703
00:27:24.061 --> 00:27:25.381
and show you, "Yes, it does."

704
00:27:25.381 --> 00:27:27.641
<v ->And you've done some studies in partnership with</v>

705
00:27:27.641 --> 00:27:29.201
or through Stanford University?

706
00:27:29.201 --> 00:27:31.341
<v ->Yeah, we've done some things in Stanford along the way,</v>

707
00:27:31.341 --> 00:27:32.761
we've done a lot of universities--

708
00:27:32.761 --> 00:27:35.041
<v Voiceover>Because they're all looking for kind of</v>

709
00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:37.681
the mind-body connection, to health now too,

710
00:27:37.681 --> 00:27:39.401
I mean they're taking it seriously, finally.

711
00:27:39.401 --> 00:27:41.181
<v ->Yeah, and there's more of it going on.</v>

712
00:27:42.936 --> 00:27:44.576
We were in partnership with a lot of people now.

713
00:27:44.576 --> 00:27:45.456
Very interesting things.

714
00:27:45.456 --> 00:27:47.916
We just entered into a partnership last week

715
00:27:47.916 --> 00:27:50.696
with AOL Huffington Post.

716
00:27:50.696 --> 00:27:53.036
And they're coming out with Arianna Huffington's

717
00:27:53.036 --> 00:27:56.916
big project now is a new web app called GPS for the Soul.

718
00:27:56.916 --> 00:27:57.416
<v Voiceover>Really?</v>

719
00:27:57.416 --> 00:27:59.876
<v ->And it's gonna be a whole lifestyle app.</v>

720
00:27:59.876 --> 00:28:02.256
And the driver underneath that app,

721
00:28:02.256 --> 00:28:06.196
of being in sync or out of sync is gonna be us.

722
00:28:06.196 --> 00:28:07.616
So we're in partnership with them.

723
00:28:07.616 --> 00:28:09.956
<v Voiceover>So what, we just hold our iPhones now?</v>

724
00:28:09.956 --> 00:28:11.236
<v ->Yeah.</v>

725
00:28:11.236 --> 00:28:13.836
<v Voiceover>Will it interface on some technological level?</v>

726
00:28:13.836 --> 00:28:15.936
<v ->Yeah, what happens in this technology</v>

727
00:28:15.936 --> 00:28:19.576
is when you put your finger over the camera,

728
00:28:19.576 --> 00:28:21.536
it picks up the pulse through your finger

729
00:28:21.536 --> 00:28:24.416
and converts it into heart rate variability data.

730
00:28:24.416 --> 00:28:26.736
(mumbles) drive things like whether you're in sync

731
00:28:26.736 --> 00:28:28.996
to make this decision about what you're gonna eat for dinner

732
00:28:28.996 --> 00:28:30.916
tonight or whether you're out of sync

733
00:28:30.916 --> 00:28:33.536
and need to get in sync before you have that conversation

734
00:28:33.536 --> 00:28:34.636
and things like that.

735
00:28:34.636 --> 00:28:36.156
So that's what's coming next.

736
00:28:36.156 --> 00:28:37.956
<v ->That's fascinating.</v>

737
00:28:37.956 --> 00:28:40.196
I could just see business meetings of the future.

738
00:28:40.196 --> 00:28:42.416
Get your iPhone out, pull up the app.

739
00:28:42.416 --> 00:28:44.096
Okay, let's get the thumb over it

740
00:28:44.096 --> 00:28:45.778
and see if we're on for this thing.

741
00:28:45.778 --> 00:28:47.418
<v ->We're coming out with our own too later this year</v>

742
00:28:47.418 --> 00:28:49.661
and the reason we are, ours will have a sensor

743
00:28:49.661 --> 00:28:51.382
that you plug into the phone and the reason for that

744
00:28:51.382 --> 00:28:55.382
is the ones that use the camera pick up less samples,

745
00:28:55.382 --> 00:28:57.262
so the heart rate variability information

746
00:28:57.262 --> 00:28:59.082
is not as truly scientific.

747
00:28:59.082 --> 00:29:01.162
But with the ear sensor like we'll have

748
00:29:01.162 --> 00:29:03.702
you get true heart rate variability information.

749
00:29:03.702 --> 00:29:05.942
It'll be on our iPhones and that's coming out

750
00:29:05.942 --> 00:29:06.862
later this year.

751
00:29:06.862 --> 00:29:07.742
<v ->Oh that is amazing.</v>

752
00:29:07.742 --> 00:29:09.382
<v ->So we have university associations,</v>

753
00:29:09.382 --> 00:29:12.402
we have licensees around the world,

754
00:29:12.402 --> 00:29:13.882
we have thousands and thousands of people

755
00:29:13.882 --> 00:29:16.962
that are participating in some way in HeartMath.

756
00:29:16.962 --> 00:29:18.622
I'm always amazed and appreciative.

757
00:29:18.622 --> 00:29:20.602
I mean, this started out with Doc's vision

758
00:29:20.602 --> 00:29:22.222
and a bunch of us in North Carolina

759
00:29:22.222 --> 00:29:23.822
and a bunch of us here in California

760
00:29:23.822 --> 00:29:25.322
that we're doing the best we could

761
00:29:25.322 --> 00:29:27.462
to expand our consciousness.

762
00:29:27.462 --> 00:29:29.162
We never thought we'd write books

763
00:29:29.162 --> 00:29:31.482
or have an institution of any kind

764
00:29:31.482 --> 00:29:33.884
or ever be a speaker or any of that stuff.

765
00:29:33.884 --> 00:29:36.084
Never been interviewed with somebody like you.

766
00:29:36.084 --> 00:29:37.984
These things are not even in consciousness.

767
00:29:37.984 --> 00:29:41.744
We had no idea this could happen but it did,

768
00:29:41.744 --> 00:29:43.504
so all of this is going on today,

769
00:29:43.504 --> 00:29:45.724
HeartMath has grown and grown and grown.

770
00:29:45.724 --> 00:29:46.364
I'm proud of it.

771
00:29:46.364 --> 00:29:51.064
I think our footprint in the world is significant.

772
00:29:51.064 --> 00:29:52.044
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

773
00:29:52.044 --> 00:29:54.185
<v ->I think we've found some nice things to help people.</v>

774
00:29:54.185 --> 00:29:56.445
I was asked in another interview one time, not long ago,

775
00:29:56.445 --> 00:29:59.245
it's a question I've never been asked before,

776
00:29:59.245 --> 00:30:00.705
I didn't have a standard answer.

777
00:30:00.705 --> 00:30:02.665
The interviewer asked me, "What do you think HeartMath's

778
00:30:02.665 --> 00:30:05.205
"greatest contribution to the world has been so far?"

779
00:30:05.205 --> 00:30:07.185
My answer was, "We've helped validate

780
00:30:07.185 --> 00:30:09.045
"other people's belief systems."

781
00:30:09.045 --> 00:30:10.905
"We helped build that bridge."

782
00:30:10.905 --> 00:30:12.545
For many other things people believe

783
00:30:12.545 --> 00:30:15.545
but didn't have the scientific or empirical understanding

784
00:30:15.545 --> 00:30:18.685
to pull it all together and there's something like 5,000

785
00:30:18.685 --> 00:30:20.645
to 6,000 books in print today

786
00:30:20.645 --> 00:30:23.365
that are siding us in some way.

787
00:30:23.365 --> 00:30:25.125
<v Voiceover>And for people to be able to have faith</v>

788
00:30:25.125 --> 00:30:27.205
in themselves again it's almost like we need

789
00:30:27.205 --> 00:30:30.465
that bridge of science to give us the permission

790
00:30:30.465 --> 00:30:32.605
to believe in ourselves again.

791
00:30:32.605 --> 00:30:33.565
<v ->Exactly.</v>

792
00:30:33.565 --> 00:30:35.045
I like that, it's a good phrase.

793
00:30:35.045 --> 00:30:37.325
What I wanna see happen now as we move forward is,

794
00:30:37.325 --> 00:30:39.645
I think, the science can override

795
00:30:39.645 --> 00:30:41.145
some of the other things about HeartMath.

796
00:30:41.145 --> 00:30:42.865
We get known for the science but not so much

797
00:30:42.865 --> 00:30:45.545
for all the transformational changes

798
00:30:45.545 --> 00:30:47.285
we've created in people's lives

799
00:30:47.285 --> 00:30:49.265
or the tools and the techniques we've created

800
00:30:49.265 --> 00:30:50.985
that we can offer through our training programs

801
00:30:50.985 --> 00:30:53.525
and to things like our HeartMastery program and all that.

802
00:30:53.525 --> 00:30:55.625
All of this sort of gets pushed to the back

803
00:30:55.625 --> 00:30:58.465
when we start looking like we're all about science--

804
00:30:58.465 --> 00:31:00.305
<v Voiceover>When the app comes out, you bet.</v>

805
00:31:00.305 --> 00:31:01.426
<v ->Or all that technology.</v>

806
00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:03.726
And there's so much more to what we've done here.

807
00:31:03.726 --> 00:31:08.527
We were doing a lot of work before we had any of that

808
00:31:08.527 --> 00:31:11.147
in our early days of training programs and schools,

809
00:31:11.147 --> 00:31:13.287
the US Military, all these places.

810
00:31:13.287 --> 00:31:15.667
I mean, I used to go in US military bases and do trainings

811
00:31:15.667 --> 00:31:18.087
and I had no PowerPoint, I had nothing.

812
00:31:18.087 --> 00:31:21.647
I had me standing in front of a room with a flip chart

813
00:31:21.647 --> 00:31:23.647
and was explaining to them about the power

814
00:31:23.647 --> 00:31:25.327
and intelligence of the heart.

815
00:31:25.327 --> 00:31:26.587
So it goes way, way back.

816
00:31:26.587 --> 00:31:28.527
Now we have all these tools and all these things

817
00:31:28.527 --> 00:31:32.867
in the room but it just came from our belief,

818
00:31:32.867 --> 00:31:36.307
we had such a strong believe in what we found in ourselves

819
00:31:36.307 --> 00:31:38.427
and such a strong desire to share it,

820
00:31:38.427 --> 00:31:40.427
not because we were trying to be a big deal

821
00:31:40.427 --> 00:31:43.717
or be somebody but just because it felt like the mission.

822
00:31:45.444 --> 00:31:46.464
We had to do.

823
00:31:46.464 --> 00:31:47.904
<v Voiceover>I guess the best compliment</v>

824
00:31:47.904 --> 00:31:49.424
you would have down the road

825
00:31:49.424 --> 00:31:52.104
is when people don't even need the technology anymore

826
00:31:52.104 --> 00:31:54.084
because they've learned to master themselves

827
00:31:54.084 --> 00:31:56.584
to the point where you can go in on a feeling level

828
00:31:56.584 --> 00:31:58.504
and you know when you're in that coherence.

829
00:31:58.504 --> 00:31:59.504
<v ->That's right, exactly.</v>

830
00:31:59.504 --> 00:32:01.044
And that's what the technology actually ends up

831
00:32:01.044 --> 00:32:02.144
leading people to.

832
00:32:02.144 --> 00:32:03.104
They don't have to walk around

833
00:32:03.104 --> 00:32:04.824
with their emWave on all the time.

834
00:32:04.824 --> 00:32:06.984
But it trains them to understand what that state feels like

835
00:32:06.984 --> 00:32:10.144
and they get verification back in a form of biofeedback,

836
00:32:10.144 --> 00:32:12.924
although biofeedback is a term that relates

837
00:32:12.924 --> 00:32:15.704
to a specific discipline when we use that term;

838
00:32:15.704 --> 00:32:17.804
but it's giving them feedback from their body

839
00:32:17.804 --> 00:32:19.484
where they can actually see the changes

840
00:32:19.484 --> 00:32:22.284
they are making, the things they're doing

841
00:32:22.284 --> 00:32:24.844
to feel differently are actually impacting them

842
00:32:24.844 --> 00:32:26.504
in a physiological way.

843
00:32:26.504 --> 00:32:28.324
And then when that connection happens, boom,

844
00:32:28.324 --> 00:32:30.964
it's like the belief gets so strong.

845
00:32:30.964 --> 00:32:32.724
And then maybe they're not with their emWave,

846
00:32:32.724 --> 00:32:35.244
they don't have the handheld or out in the world somewhere

847
00:32:35.244 --> 00:32:39.464
and they went to a restaurant and they get a terrible meal

848
00:32:39.464 --> 00:32:42.287
and their night starts to like it's spoiled and they go,

849
00:32:42.287 --> 00:32:43.727
"Wait a minute, it don't have to be this way,"

850
00:32:43.727 --> 00:32:46.547
and, boom, they return home quickly

851
00:32:46.547 --> 00:32:48.407
to this feeling inside that they've learned

852
00:32:48.407 --> 00:32:51.207
to train themselves into by using an emWave.

853
00:32:51.207 --> 00:32:53.427
<v ->And then you mentioned a moment ago</v>

854
00:32:53.427 --> 00:32:55.147
where everything starts coming together,

855
00:32:55.147 --> 00:32:56.547
and in a minute we're gonna talk about

856
00:32:56.547 --> 00:33:00.089
the Global Coherence Initiative, but before we do that

857
00:33:00.089 --> 00:33:02.449
let's talk just a little bit more about

858
00:33:02.449 --> 00:33:03.749
anybody listening right now thinking,

859
00:33:03.749 --> 00:33:06.909
"I need to somehow interface with this."

860
00:33:06.909 --> 00:33:08.709
What are the ways in which people can interface

861
00:33:08.709 --> 00:33:12.809
with HeartMath, emWave, or programs, or HeartMastery.

862
00:33:12.809 --> 00:33:14.909
<v ->The thing I would say for somebody who wants</v>

863
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:17.250
to learn HeartMath, it's a program we came out with

864
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.851
not too long ago it's called HeartMastery.

865
00:33:19.851 --> 00:33:23.291
And so online interactive learning where we can teach

866
00:33:23.291 --> 00:33:26.091
HeartMath to someone for a whole year

867
00:33:26.091 --> 00:33:27.511
and it's divided into courses,

868
00:33:27.511 --> 00:33:29.231
there's courses over 12 months.

869
00:33:29.231 --> 00:33:31.031
We're teaching things in this, we've never been able

870
00:33:31.031 --> 00:33:33.691
to teach publicly 'cause the timeframes are shorter

871
00:33:33.691 --> 00:33:35.091
in the training program.

872
00:33:35.091 --> 00:33:36.771
Plus, for the last 10 years or so

873
00:33:36.771 --> 00:33:38.011
almost all of our training programs

874
00:33:38.011 --> 00:33:40.392
have been institutionally conducting companies

875
00:33:40.392 --> 00:33:43.032
or medical systems or schools.

876
00:33:43.032 --> 00:33:44.492
Somebody can come see me speak

877
00:33:44.492 --> 00:33:46.132
but usually I'm talking for 90 minutes,

878
00:33:46.132 --> 00:33:47.472
so how much can you teach, right?

879
00:33:47.472 --> 00:33:48.352
<v ->And you fly out.</v>

880
00:33:48.352 --> 00:33:50.872
<v Voiceover>With HeartMastery you've got 12 months of this</v>

881
00:33:50.872 --> 00:33:53.592
and you do it through listening to prerecorded courses

882
00:33:53.592 --> 00:33:56.212
so we do PowerPoints and they're prerecorded.

883
00:33:56.212 --> 00:33:57.472
I give them Deborah Rozman,

884
00:33:57.472 --> 00:33:59.912
give them a woman named (mumbles).

885
00:33:59.912 --> 00:34:03.213
And there's four classes per course and then a bonus class

886
00:34:03.213 --> 00:34:04.453
so you get five of them.

887
00:34:04.453 --> 00:34:07.153
You download your workbooks and your tool cards and all that

888
00:34:07.153 --> 00:34:08.573
so it's all all in one.

889
00:34:08.573 --> 00:34:11.694
And that's really convenient 'cause the learning

890
00:34:11.694 --> 00:34:14.174
can take those things and listen to their class each

891
00:34:14.174 --> 00:34:16.214
week whenever they want to.

892
00:34:16.214 --> 00:34:17.454
We didn't feel that was quite enough

893
00:34:17.454 --> 00:34:20.854
so what we did is we created a lab discussion group call

894
00:34:20.854 --> 00:34:23.214
for every class once a week.

895
00:34:23.214 --> 00:34:25.994
So the class gets together on the phone with the facilitator

896
00:34:25.994 --> 00:34:30.014
very often that's me or one of the other teachers

897
00:34:30.014 --> 00:34:32.294
and we have a discussion about this

898
00:34:32.294 --> 00:34:34.014
and the people discuss it with each other.

899
00:34:34.014 --> 00:34:37.754
So this wonderful community feeling starts to happen.

900
00:34:37.754 --> 00:34:40.214
I finished up a group yesterday

901
00:34:40.214 --> 00:34:43.174
for the advanced course, it's the third course,

902
00:34:43.174 --> 00:34:46.794
and I had that group and work through them once a week

903
00:34:46.794 --> 00:34:49.114
for four weeks and I got attached to these people

904
00:34:49.114 --> 00:34:50.674
and when it came down to the end yesterday

905
00:34:50.674 --> 00:34:51.954
and it was like, they're gonna go now

906
00:34:51.954 --> 00:34:53.674
to the next course, right, and somebody else

907
00:34:53.674 --> 00:34:55.494
is gonna do that and I'm gonna take the next group

908
00:34:55.494 --> 00:34:56.974
that comes in to the advanced course

909
00:34:56.974 --> 00:34:58.574
and I was like emotional about this.

910
00:34:58.574 --> 00:35:01.374
It's like, "Oh my gosh," I felt such heart for these people,

911
00:35:01.374 --> 00:35:03.195
I almost got a little teary.

912
00:35:03.195 --> 00:35:04.855
I don't want to push the hang up button here

913
00:35:04.855 --> 00:35:05.815
you know what I mean?

914
00:35:05.815 --> 00:35:08.915
So it had the components of modernity

915
00:35:08.915 --> 00:35:10.875
so people could learn online,

916
00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:12.155
listening to prerecorded things

917
00:35:12.155 --> 00:35:15.416
but we built the human part into it.

918
00:35:15.416 --> 00:35:17.196
So that we could feel that connection

919
00:35:17.196 --> 00:35:19.316
and create a community of people that are doing this

920
00:35:19.316 --> 00:35:20.276
and it's wonderful.

921
00:35:20.276 --> 00:35:23.676
I wanted it because I wanted to be able to share more

922
00:35:23.676 --> 00:35:25.196
of what HeartMath is and does.

923
00:35:25.196 --> 00:35:27.416
And I didn't wanna do it if they're trying to organize

924
00:35:27.416 --> 00:35:29.636
a workshop business or something anymore.

925
00:35:29.636 --> 00:35:31.676
It doesn't feel like the way to go.

926
00:35:31.676 --> 00:35:32.936
So it took a while to get this done

927
00:35:32.936 --> 00:35:35.616
but I had no idea I was gonna feel this much

928
00:35:35.616 --> 00:35:37.256
from this as I have.

929
00:35:37.256 --> 00:35:40.796
That was the pleasurable, shocking part.

930
00:35:40.796 --> 00:35:42.416
<v Voiceover>When people get done with it besides the fact</v>

931
00:35:42.416 --> 00:35:44.796
that they have learned how to work with their mind

932
00:35:44.796 --> 00:35:49.656
and their heart and get this HeartMastery in their own lives

933
00:35:49.656 --> 00:35:51.816
is there some extension of that

934
00:35:51.816 --> 00:35:54.396
or do they have some kind of a certificate,

935
00:35:54.396 --> 00:35:57.316
or is there some way they can work with others after that?

936
00:35:57.316 --> 00:35:58.636
<v ->There are certifications we have.</v>

937
00:35:58.636 --> 00:36:00.476
We have wonderful people that coach.

938
00:36:00.476 --> 00:36:02.496
For example, the HeartMath 101 Provider Program,

939
00:36:02.496 --> 00:36:03.956
we have one for medical professionals

940
00:36:03.956 --> 00:36:06.856
to learn more about heart rate variability.

941
00:36:06.856 --> 00:36:09.036
There are things like that in the HeartMath system.

942
00:36:09.036 --> 00:36:10.816
Because what I found, and I think it's true,

943
00:36:10.816 --> 00:36:12.316
many of the people that are gonna be attracted

944
00:36:12.316 --> 00:36:15.136
to learning HeartMath are people who care,

945
00:36:15.136 --> 00:36:17.816
they wanna help others, they wanna help the world, right?

946
00:36:17.816 --> 00:36:20.516
And so part of that was the reason we created

947
00:36:20.516 --> 00:36:21.876
the Global Coherence Initiative

948
00:36:21.876 --> 00:36:23.136
which we'll talk about in a little while,

949
00:36:23.136 --> 00:36:25.856
but they wanna share, they wanna have the ability

950
00:36:25.856 --> 00:36:29.736
to feel like they're making a contribution

951
00:36:29.736 --> 00:36:31.816
to the betterment of the lives of others also.

952
00:36:31.816 --> 00:36:33.596
<v ->And also people who were in pain</v>

953
00:36:33.596 --> 00:36:34.816
and people who have issues,

954
00:36:34.816 --> 00:36:36.376
I mean even physiological issues.

955
00:36:36.376 --> 00:36:39.276
I mean, it sounds like HeartMath is a great

956
00:36:39.276 --> 00:36:40.956
possible replacement for statins.

957
00:36:40.956 --> 00:36:43.676
<v ->Well actually about 20,000 medical professionals</v>

958
00:36:43.676 --> 00:36:46.076
that we know of, this goes into our database,

959
00:36:46.076 --> 00:36:47.356
that use HeartMath.

960
00:36:47.356 --> 00:36:48.196
<v Voiceover>20,000?</v>

961
00:36:48.196 --> 00:36:48.776
<v ->Yeah.</v>

962
00:36:48.776 --> 00:36:50.056
<v Voiceover>That's really good news.</v>

963
00:36:50.056 --> 00:36:51.236
<v ->That one little subset in their database</v>

964
00:36:51.236 --> 00:36:53.857
is 20,000 health professionals

965
00:36:53.857 --> 00:36:55.997
who approach those products or programs from us.

966
00:36:55.997 --> 00:36:57.097
<v Voiceover>Oh that's fabulous.</v>

967
00:36:57.097 --> 00:37:01.087
<v ->So there's a lot going on in healthcare and</v>

968
00:37:02.777 --> 00:37:04.897
it is coming from that care place,

969
00:37:04.897 --> 00:37:07.057
people wanting to do something for others

970
00:37:07.057 --> 00:37:09.238
and we try to facilitate that while we still have

971
00:37:09.238 --> 00:37:12.579
to maintain controls how our materials are used, et cetera.

972
00:37:12.579 --> 00:37:14.299
But one day, a long time ago now,

973
00:37:14.299 --> 00:37:16.559
it's like when the internet got up and running

974
00:37:16.559 --> 00:37:18.599
it was really popular, I googled HeartMath

975
00:37:18.599 --> 00:37:22.680
and I spelled it just like it is one word,

976
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.281
not separated with quotation marks around it

977
00:37:25.281 --> 00:37:27.881
so I come up with HeartMath and pushed the button

978
00:37:27.881 --> 00:37:30.702
and about 250,000 listings came up.

979
00:37:30.702 --> 00:37:32.782
And I went, "Oh my God."

980
00:37:32.782 --> 00:37:34.662
And being a businessman and being in charge

981
00:37:34.662 --> 00:37:36.882
of divisions that are responsible for maintaining

982
00:37:36.882 --> 00:37:39.422
their intellectual property control and all that I went,

983
00:37:39.422 --> 00:37:41.502
"I've lost control."

984
00:37:41.502 --> 00:37:42.783
That was my first thought.

985
00:37:42.783 --> 00:37:45.583
<v ->Then the replacement attitude was, "It worked (laughs)."</v>

986
00:37:46.724 --> 00:37:50.244
It's out of control and it worked you know what I mean?

987
00:37:50.244 --> 00:37:51.764
It's like there's a lot of people out there doing it,

988
00:37:51.764 --> 00:37:53.744
and using and finding ways to integrate it in their life

989
00:37:53.744 --> 00:37:55.344
and so it was a heartwarming moment

990
00:37:55.344 --> 00:37:57.264
to see how much it happened.

991
00:37:57.264 --> 00:37:59.424
And you could see it through the eyes of the web.

992
00:37:59.424 --> 00:38:00.984
You could take a look now and see,

993
00:38:00.984 --> 00:38:02.844
"Oh my gosh, look at all these people all over the world

994
00:38:02.844 --> 00:38:05.144
"who are using our work in some way."

995
00:38:05.144 --> 00:38:06.864
And that was amazing.

996
00:38:06.864 --> 00:38:08.345
<v Voiceover>What a wonderful indication of the way</v>

997
00:38:08.345 --> 00:38:10.905
humanity is going as well.

998
00:38:10.905 --> 00:38:12.028
<v ->It's moving in the right direction.</v>

999
00:38:12.028 --> 00:38:16.609
I think part of the shift and the generic term of shift,

1000
00:38:16.609 --> 00:38:19.469
it's bringing in a new form of heart intelligence,

1001
00:38:19.469 --> 00:38:22.029
the new turn of the spiral that type of intelligence

1002
00:38:22.029 --> 00:38:24.570
to create a more heart-centric world, I think.

1003
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:26.690
And I don't mean that the soft and squishy world

1004
00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:28.650
we all walk around and some fluffy place

1005
00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:30.430
but a world that cooperates better,

1006
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:31.930
a world that has more harmony in it,

1007
00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:34.810
a world that has more of a natural ability

1008
00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:37.610
to create peace those kind of things.

1009
00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:41.131
The type of intelligence that comes from Heart Intelligence

1010
00:38:41.131 --> 00:38:42.850
is more high speed and more intuitive

1011
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:44.550
that it allows us to see into these problems

1012
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:47.570
that look unsolvable and come up with effective solutions

1013
00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:49.470
for these things so we can get through

1014
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:50.990
some of those tough times and figure out

1015
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:53.210
how we're gonna live prosperously

1016
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.750
as a global society on this one hunk of rock.

1017
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:57.290
I mean, we're gonna figure that out

1018
00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:00.290
and it's not gonna be easy but we are.

1019
00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:02.410
I don't think we're gonna figure it out by going at it

1020
00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:05.110
through logical linear based intelligence only,

1021
00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:06.950
we have to come in with a new bandwidth

1022
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:09.370
of intelligence capacity to figure this stuff out.

1023
00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:10.070
<v Voiceover>I agree.</v>

1024
00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:11.052
<v ->And we're gonna do it.</v>

1025
00:39:11.052 --> 00:39:12.313
<v Voiceover>It kind of organically moves us</v>

1026
00:39:12.313 --> 00:39:14.433
away from competition.

1027
00:39:14.433 --> 00:39:16.413
I mean, not that there isn't healthy competition,

1028
00:39:16.413 --> 00:39:17.693
let's do a foot race or whatever

1029
00:39:17.693 --> 00:39:18.913
but you know what I'm talking about.

1030
00:39:18.913 --> 00:39:22.913
Survival oriented, fear oriented competition.

1031
00:39:22.913 --> 00:39:25.054
<v ->Big paradigms of the way the world function</v>

1032
00:39:25.054 --> 00:39:26.914
are coming apart right now

1033
00:39:26.914 --> 00:39:29.194
and they're trying to be replaced by new.

1034
00:39:29.194 --> 00:39:31.574
One of the ones you just mentioned is one.

1035
00:39:31.574 --> 00:39:33.154
It's a huge paradigm but it's like

1036
00:39:33.154 --> 00:39:35.394
competition versus cooperation.

1037
00:39:35.394 --> 00:39:37.374
So even some of the struggles we make

1038
00:39:37.374 --> 00:39:40.534
like around resources, and around the resources needed

1039
00:39:40.534 --> 00:39:45.054
to take care of things are gonna force what, cooperation.

1040
00:39:45.054 --> 00:39:46.834
We're not gonna be able to fight our way through it

1041
00:39:46.834 --> 00:39:48.234
and take it away from somebody else.

1042
00:39:48.234 --> 00:39:50.194
I mean, who knows, maybe some of that could happen

1043
00:39:50.194 --> 00:39:52.774
but ultimately for this to work it's gonna have to be

1044
00:39:52.774 --> 00:39:54.734
because we learned how to share.

1045
00:39:54.734 --> 00:39:57.754
That's an example of cooperation replacing competition.

1046
00:39:57.754 --> 00:40:00.474
Another sort of related one would be ambition.

1047
00:40:00.474 --> 00:40:02.474
Ambition's not bad, hopes and dreams and all that

1048
00:40:02.474 --> 00:40:05.194
but this raw, unbridled, self-centric ambition

1049
00:40:05.194 --> 00:40:09.994
of getting what you want and nothing stands in your way

1050
00:40:09.994 --> 00:40:12.714
a lot of the world has been build around that

1051
00:40:12.714 --> 00:40:14.614
and that's gotten us to a certain point

1052
00:40:14.614 --> 00:40:16.174
that it isn't been all bad.

1053
00:40:16.174 --> 00:40:18.114
But in today's world when I look at it

1054
00:40:18.114 --> 00:40:19.974
I don't see that working like it used to.

1055
00:40:19.974 --> 00:40:20.896
<v Voiceover>No, no, no,</v>

1056
00:40:20.896 --> 00:40:22.878
every indicator in the headline news

1057
00:40:22.878 --> 00:40:24.621
it's not working too well right now.

1058
00:40:24.621 --> 00:40:26.141
<v ->It's backfiring.</v>

1059
00:40:26.141 --> 00:40:28.941
It's actually creating 180 degree turn on what you wanted

1060
00:40:28.941 --> 00:40:30.841
that creates the opposite of that.

1061
00:40:30.841 --> 00:40:32.701
And I see that like you said in the news

1062
00:40:32.701 --> 00:40:35.921
and I also see it in the lives of individuals

1063
00:40:35.921 --> 00:40:39.221
and people that I know and people I observe and all that;

1064
00:40:39.221 --> 00:40:40.901
it doesn't work the same way anymore.

1065
00:40:40.901 --> 00:40:44.601
A big fundamental paradigm is coming undone.

1066
00:40:44.601 --> 00:40:46.541
<v Voiceover>Absolutely, and you can feel it in your heart</v>

1067
00:40:46.541 --> 00:40:48.281
and just in your heart energy.

1068
00:40:48.281 --> 00:40:50.321
If you were having a thought right now

1069
00:40:50.321 --> 00:40:53.061
about how I got to beat this person out on that.

1070
00:40:53.061 --> 00:40:58.061
It is a constricted, horrible, tight-closed feeling

1071
00:40:58.102 --> 00:41:00.542
that happens.

1072
00:41:00.542 --> 00:41:03.342
I know that's really basic but obviously we're moving away

1073
00:41:03.342 --> 00:41:04.742
from that and what you're doing

1074
00:41:04.742 --> 00:41:06.502
is contributing greatly, I think.

1075
00:41:06.502 --> 00:41:10.402
<v ->Basically, Regina, it's also seriously important.</v>

1076
00:41:10.402 --> 00:41:13.962
It's the huge blocks of consciousness are changing.

1077
00:41:13.962 --> 00:41:16.942
The way I've always seen it is there's this field

1078
00:41:16.942 --> 00:41:19.322
of consciousness reflecting back to us,

1079
00:41:19.322 --> 00:41:21.502
not just what we think in our minds

1080
00:41:21.502 --> 00:41:23.682
but especially what we're actually feeling in our hearts.

1081
00:41:23.682 --> 00:41:24.962
And we draw from this consciousness

1082
00:41:24.962 --> 00:41:27.422
that creates certain psychologies, right?

1083
00:41:27.422 --> 00:41:30.883
Psychologies create this sort of paradigms of what is

1084
00:41:30.883 --> 00:41:33.683
and what isn't, what reality is, what's good, what's bad,

1085
00:41:33.683 --> 00:41:34.983
what's right, what's wrong,

1086
00:41:34.983 --> 00:41:37.323
and certain things like big is better.

1087
00:41:37.323 --> 00:41:42.103
Things just sort of embedded in mass consciousness.

1088
00:41:42.103 --> 00:41:46.043
And that filters down in the behavior,

1089
00:41:46.043 --> 00:41:48.523
how we function, how we operate as human beings

1090
00:41:48.523 --> 00:41:52.103
in the systems like government finance education,

1091
00:41:52.103 --> 00:41:54.283
medicine, all those kind of things

1092
00:41:54.283 --> 00:41:56.683
that are systematic of that and ends up,

1093
00:41:56.683 --> 00:41:58.303
"Here's what the world is."

1094
00:41:58.303 --> 00:42:01.103
Well, as the field of consciousness begins to change

1095
00:42:01.103 --> 00:42:02.983
then those paradigms begin to change,

1096
00:42:02.983 --> 00:42:04.243
and the psychology begins to change

1097
00:42:04.243 --> 00:42:05.783
and the systems begin to change,

1098
00:42:05.783 --> 00:42:08.963
then life on a day to day basis begins to change.

1099
00:42:08.963 --> 00:42:11.143
And it feeds itself as we change our lives

1100
00:42:11.143 --> 00:42:12.703
it feeds the field of consciousness

1101
00:42:12.703 --> 00:42:15.523
so it's a closed loop that's going on all the time

1102
00:42:15.523 --> 00:42:17.663
where consciousness is still turned down

1103
00:42:17.663 --> 00:42:19.823
we're feeding back the consciousness.

1104
00:42:19.823 --> 00:42:22.983
The more heart related choices we make individually,

1105
00:42:22.983 --> 00:42:26.263
moment to moment, day to day feeds that field.

1106
00:42:26.263 --> 00:42:28.543
We code that field with that information.

1107
00:42:28.543 --> 00:42:30.583
The biggest service anybody can do,

1108
00:42:30.583 --> 00:42:32.683
and I'll say this to anybody watching right now,

1109
00:42:32.683 --> 00:42:34.703
regardless of the projects we do

1110
00:42:34.703 --> 00:42:36.823
or whether I'm involved personally

1111
00:42:36.823 --> 00:42:39.443
with something like HeartMath is even secondary to this,

1112
00:42:39.443 --> 00:42:42.563
it's the moment to moment changes that we make

1113
00:42:42.563 --> 00:42:45.403
during the course of our days, in the amount of heart,

1114
00:42:45.403 --> 00:42:46.963
and care, and love, and heart related things

1115
00:42:46.963 --> 00:42:48.763
that we put out into that field

1116
00:42:48.763 --> 00:42:51.883
that is the biggest service of all.

1117
00:42:51.883 --> 00:42:54.983
<v Voiceover>Which takes us directly into Global Coherence.</v>

1118
00:42:54.983 --> 00:42:55.783
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1119
00:42:55.783 --> 00:42:56.803
<v Voiceover>Okay, let's start.</v>

1120
00:42:56.803 --> 00:42:59.764
Launch in, how did you go from HeartMath

1121
00:42:59.764 --> 00:43:02.824
into Global Coherence and we'll go from there.

1122
00:43:02.824 --> 00:43:04.904
<v ->Let me briefly explain coherence.</v>

1123
00:43:04.904 --> 00:43:07.805
Coherence is a term getting used a lot and now,

1124
00:43:07.805 --> 00:43:11.045
they call it cardiac coherence sometimes or coherence

1125
00:43:11.045 --> 00:43:12.828
and it's being used a lot and of course it being

1126
00:43:12.828 --> 00:43:14.308
natural progression for it to be used

1127
00:43:14.308 --> 00:43:16.828
and it's not a term that has never been used before.

1128
00:43:16.828 --> 00:43:19.328
But a lot of that goes back to some of the ways

1129
00:43:19.328 --> 00:43:21.328
that we characterized it and now it's becoming

1130
00:43:21.328 --> 00:43:23.648
more popular and it's a good thing that it is.

1131
00:43:23.648 --> 00:43:26.728
Coherence is a highly ordered state,

1132
00:43:26.728 --> 00:43:27.968
it's efficient, it's effective.

1133
00:43:27.968 --> 00:43:30.028
Less energy is being wasted.

1134
00:43:30.028 --> 00:43:33.108
We know how to measure it and the state that we can measure,

1135
00:43:33.108 --> 00:43:35.248
there's a medical term for it called

1136
00:43:35.248 --> 00:43:37.588
psychophysiological coherence.

1137
00:43:37.588 --> 00:43:40.248
What that means is that this physiological level

1138
00:43:40.248 --> 00:43:42.748
all the body systems are synchronizing

1139
00:43:42.748 --> 00:43:44.628
to the master rhythm maker in our body

1140
00:43:44.628 --> 00:43:46.748
which happens to be the heart.

1141
00:43:46.748 --> 00:43:50.048
So respiration, digestion, immune system response,

1142
00:43:50.048 --> 00:43:52.568
hormonal balance, brain function, all those things

1143
00:43:52.568 --> 00:43:54.788
begin to synchronize to the heart.

1144
00:43:54.788 --> 00:43:56.488
And when the heart rhythm is smooth in order

1145
00:43:56.488 --> 00:43:59.928
it pulls them in so that they're all working harmoniously,

1146
00:43:59.928 --> 00:44:02.048
cooperating not competing.

1147
00:44:02.048 --> 00:44:04.228
<v Voiceover>Reducing friction and resistance.</v>

1148
00:44:04.228 --> 00:44:05.448
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1149
00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:10.430
Highly effective physiological state.

1150
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:12.950
In that state, everything from perceptual feel

1151
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.890
to reaction speed time a lot of things

1152
00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:16.470
begin to line up and change.

1153
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:18.970
That's why military gets training from us

1154
00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:20.810
in coherence building techniques,

1155
00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:23.790
that's why Olympic athletes do.

1156
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:25.830
'Cause that coherence state is very perceptive,

1157
00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:28.430
very aware, very acutely refined--

1158
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:29.571
<v Voiceover>Can I just say efficient and,</v>

1159
00:44:29.571 --> 00:44:30.611
quick, very responsive.

1160
00:44:30.611 --> 00:44:31.831
<v ->Correct.</v>

1161
00:44:31.831 --> 00:44:33.671
The psychological part, the psycho part

1162
00:44:33.671 --> 00:44:36.591
of psychophysiological coherence is the fact that

1163
00:44:36.591 --> 00:44:38.671
what triggers the coherence state

1164
00:44:38.671 --> 00:44:42.131
is activation of positive emotions.

1165
00:44:42.131 --> 00:44:44.371
And then once you get it activated,

1166
00:44:44.371 --> 00:44:47.131
then there's a flow of positive emotions

1167
00:44:47.131 --> 00:44:49.771
so it's both a cause and an effect.

1168
00:44:49.771 --> 00:44:52.331
So you make an effort to appreciate the good things

1169
00:44:52.331 --> 00:44:54.631
in your life and you'll become more coherent

1170
00:44:54.631 --> 00:44:56.671
as that appreciation grows then it's easier

1171
00:44:56.671 --> 00:44:59.271
to be more caring or have a positive outlook on something

1172
00:44:59.271 --> 00:45:02.771
because you're in that place, so it feeds it.

1173
00:45:02.771 --> 00:45:06.751
So we know how to measure coherence

1174
00:45:06.751 --> 00:45:08.711
through the heart rate variability technology,

1175
00:45:08.711 --> 00:45:11.511
emWaves, things like that, we can measure that.

1176
00:45:11.511 --> 00:45:12.951
Through the training programs we've done

1177
00:45:12.951 --> 00:45:15.391
we know how to create it in individuals

1178
00:45:15.391 --> 00:45:18.371
and how they can apply it in their lives.

1179
00:45:18.371 --> 00:45:20.091
The organizational trainings that we do

1180
00:45:20.091 --> 00:45:21.771
we know how that impacts an organization.

1181
00:45:21.771 --> 00:45:24.631
Their bottom lines, the retention of their employees,

1182
00:45:24.631 --> 00:45:27.611
healthcare cost, all those things and we've done that.

1183
00:45:27.611 --> 00:45:29.851
So we've done that for a long time.

1184
00:45:29.851 --> 00:45:32.231
So a few years ago we sort of went back

1185
00:45:32.231 --> 00:45:35.611
to where we started and in the beginning

1186
00:45:35.611 --> 00:45:36.911
we didn't have any of this stuff,

1187
00:45:36.911 --> 00:45:41.551
we were about spirit,

1188
00:45:41.551 --> 00:45:44.051
about spiritual things and we never really lost that

1189
00:45:44.051 --> 00:45:45.831
for sure but we hadn't emphasized it

1190
00:45:45.831 --> 00:45:47.751
in the public work that we do.

1191
00:45:47.751 --> 00:45:49.371
So we decided where will we be next,

1192
00:45:49.371 --> 00:45:52.741
can we do anything to create more Global Coherence?

1193
00:45:53.751 --> 00:45:57.651
And so our researchers were approached

1194
00:45:57.651 --> 00:46:00.631
by a woman named Dr. Elizabeth Rauscher

1195
00:46:00.631 --> 00:46:03.231
who had developed some technology with her husband

1196
00:46:03.231 --> 00:46:07.691
a long time ago measuring changes in a energetic field

1197
00:46:07.691 --> 00:46:10.831
produced by the earth called the ionosphere.

1198
00:46:10.831 --> 00:46:13.571
And she came in and she said they had created this

1199
00:46:13.571 --> 00:46:15.731
because they believe that seismic activity

1200
00:46:15.731 --> 00:46:19.051
was being preceded by changes in the ionosphere

1201
00:46:19.051 --> 00:46:21.691
and they could predict earthquakes and volcanic eruptions

1202
00:46:21.691 --> 00:46:23.791
by looking at the ionosphere.

1203
00:46:23.791 --> 00:46:25.451
But her husband had died a long time ago

1204
00:46:25.451 --> 00:46:27.472
and she didn't do anything with the technology

1205
00:46:27.472 --> 00:46:29.492
and didn't know what to do with it exactly;

1206
00:46:29.492 --> 00:46:32.372
where it should be placed or where it could go next.

1207
00:46:32.372 --> 00:46:33.932
And so she talked to our researchers

1208
00:46:33.932 --> 00:46:34.932
and they asked her a question.

1209
00:46:34.932 --> 00:46:36.752
They said, "Well that's an interesting application,

1210
00:46:36.752 --> 00:46:39.872
"but do you believe that emotion,

1211
00:46:39.872 --> 00:46:42.772
"mass human emotion and consciousness,

1212
00:46:42.772 --> 00:46:45.392
"has an impact or relationship to the ionosphere?"

1213
00:46:45.392 --> 00:46:46.892
And she said she'd always believe that,

1214
00:46:46.892 --> 00:46:49.112
she's an astrophysicist, well credentialed,

1215
00:46:49.112 --> 00:46:50.612
and NASA scientist and all that

1216
00:46:50.612 --> 00:46:52.532
but she'd always believed these things.

1217
00:46:52.532 --> 00:46:55.212
So we took that technology, refined it,

1218
00:46:55.212 --> 00:46:57.372
took it to some new directions

1219
00:46:57.372 --> 00:47:02.372
and began to look at the earth's energetic fields

1220
00:47:02.393 --> 00:47:04.173
with the technology and there are two primary ones:

1221
00:47:04.173 --> 00:47:06.973
the ionosphere, which I mentioned, and geomagnetic field

1222
00:47:06.973 --> 00:47:10.263
which is this field, compass measures.

1223
00:47:11.293 --> 00:47:13.053
It's produced by the spinning of the iron core

1224
00:47:13.053 --> 00:47:15.293
at the center and the earth producing this field.

1225
00:47:15.293 --> 00:47:18.613
These are part of the earth as a living system.

1226
00:47:18.613 --> 00:47:22.093
They are actually protective layers around the earth

1227
00:47:22.093 --> 00:47:24.933
that if we don't have these fields there's no life here,

1228
00:47:24.933 --> 00:47:26.793
they protect us from cosmic radiation,

1229
00:47:28.898 --> 00:47:31.258
these different things that are out in space

1230
00:47:31.258 --> 00:47:33.298
that would kill off all the life here

1231
00:47:33.298 --> 00:47:35.658
if we didn't have protective layers.

1232
00:47:35.658 --> 00:47:40.160
So we had a hypothesis that

1233
00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.702
if we have enough people who are operating

1234
00:47:41.702 --> 00:47:43.722
in another level of individual coherence

1235
00:47:43.722 --> 00:47:45.362
and we organize them in a way

1236
00:47:45.362 --> 00:47:48.242
to create more collective coherence

1237
00:47:48.242 --> 00:47:50.842
it is possible that we could measure an effect

1238
00:47:50.842 --> 00:47:54.143
of that coherence in the earth's energetic fields.

1239
00:47:54.143 --> 00:47:57.063
And the hypothesis was is that mass human emotion

1240
00:47:57.063 --> 00:48:00.323
whether that'd be positive or negative

1241
00:48:00.323 --> 00:48:01.983
could have a measurable impact

1242
00:48:01.983 --> 00:48:04.563
on the earth's energetic fields.

1243
00:48:04.563 --> 00:48:05.943
So we created an organization called

1244
00:48:05.943 --> 00:48:10.783
Global Coherence Initiative, glcoherence.org,

1245
00:48:10.783 --> 00:48:13.873
it's a membership organization, people join for free.

1246
00:48:14.763 --> 00:48:17.586
There's about 42, or 3,000 people who joined now

1247
00:48:17.586 --> 00:48:21.126
from 85 different countries around the world.

1248
00:48:21.126 --> 00:48:24.366
And they become members and there's educational materials

1249
00:48:24.366 --> 00:48:27.486
on coherence and coherence building and science and all that

1250
00:48:27.486 --> 00:48:29.726
inside the site when you become a member.

1251
00:48:29.726 --> 00:48:33.746
And we have times when we bring the community together

1252
00:48:33.746 --> 00:48:36.506
to focus on various planetary needs,

1253
00:48:36.506 --> 00:48:38.106
things that are going on in society,

1254
00:48:38.106 --> 00:48:39.886
using their heart, focus, care and intention

1255
00:48:39.886 --> 00:48:41.826
to really create more harmony

1256
00:48:41.826 --> 00:48:44.526
and reduce a discord things like that.

1257
00:48:44.526 --> 00:48:48.246
And we brought the science into it as another component.

1258
00:48:48.246 --> 00:48:51.566
So Global Coherence Initiative is one of the many thousands

1259
00:48:51.566 --> 00:48:53.386
that are bringing people together using

1260
00:48:53.386 --> 00:48:55.326
the power of intention, the power of prayer,

1261
00:48:55.326 --> 00:48:56.506
the power of all these things

1262
00:48:56.506 --> 00:48:58.566
to create changes in the world.

1263
00:48:58.566 --> 00:49:00.486
We're just doing our part.

1264
00:49:00.486 --> 00:49:02.146
I think that the part that we do bring again

1265
00:49:02.146 --> 00:49:04.346
that's different or add something

1266
00:49:04.346 --> 00:49:07.336
to everything that's going on is the science.

1267
00:49:08.446 --> 00:49:10.386
A lot of research has been done and I'm reading them

1268
00:49:10.386 --> 00:49:11.806
and seeing more about it now.

1269
00:49:11.806 --> 00:49:15.016
We know that these fields have an impact on us.

1270
00:49:15.866 --> 00:49:18.546
We see changes that had been tracked for a long time

1271
00:49:18.546 --> 00:49:21.226
everything from hospital emissions to terrorist acts

1272
00:49:21.226 --> 00:49:24.286
to changes in the stock market and on and on it goes

1273
00:49:24.286 --> 00:49:26.867
to changes in the geomagnetic and ionosphere

1274
00:49:26.867 --> 00:49:30.007
fields primarily tracked to changes in solar activity,

1275
00:49:30.007 --> 00:49:33.228
solar radiation hits the fields, causes change in the field,

1276
00:49:33.228 --> 00:49:36.208
traffic accidents, hospital admissions go up, et cetera.

1277
00:49:36.208 --> 00:49:38.668
So that's being documented more and more.

1278
00:49:38.668 --> 00:49:41.048
So a good 'ole Southern boy logic would say,

1279
00:49:41.048 --> 00:49:42.508
"Well if those things are affecting me

1280
00:49:42.508 --> 00:49:44.428
"then there's got to be a relationship to it.

1281
00:49:44.428 --> 00:49:46.828
"I wonder if there's a two-way conversation going on here.

1282
00:49:46.828 --> 00:49:48.628
"Maybe I affect it."

1283
00:49:48.628 --> 00:49:51.668
And so the hypothesis is what we do,

1284
00:49:51.668 --> 00:49:54.770
especially when we have mass human emotion involved.

1285
00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:58.670
So we've seen other indicators and random number generator

1286
00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:01.750
experiments done by Dr. Roger Nelson at Princeton

1287
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:03.191
that showed this huge change in this

1288
00:50:03.191 --> 00:50:07.091
random number generator data at 9/11, for example.

1289
00:50:07.091 --> 00:50:09.191
We have information that we got from the

1290
00:50:09.191 --> 00:50:12.291
National Oceanographic and Aeronautic Administration website

1291
00:50:12.291 --> 00:50:15.231
showing the day that 9/11 hit there was a huge disruption

1292
00:50:15.231 --> 00:50:19.451
in the field that went on days afterwards.

1293
00:50:19.451 --> 00:50:21.231
So these are just indicators.

1294
00:50:21.231 --> 00:50:24.751
They don't really prove anything but they're interesting.

1295
00:50:24.751 --> 00:50:27.291
So what we've done is taken this technology

1296
00:50:27.291 --> 00:50:29.411
measuring changes in these fields

1297
00:50:29.411 --> 00:50:31.551
and developing what we call sensor sites,

1298
00:50:31.551 --> 00:50:33.011
monitoring sites.

1299
00:50:33.011 --> 00:50:35.231
And we are placing them around the world

1300
00:50:35.231 --> 00:50:36.771
and they're pretty expensive and they take time

1301
00:50:36.771 --> 00:50:38.171
to set up, et cetera.

1302
00:50:38.171 --> 00:50:41.291
But we have three working ones as of this interview.

1303
00:50:41.291 --> 00:50:42.531
One here in Northern California,

1304
00:50:42.531 --> 00:50:45.261
right up on the hill here while we're talking.

1305
00:50:46.091 --> 00:50:48.711
We have one in the United Kingdom in England,

1306
00:50:48.711 --> 00:50:52.131
South of England, we have another one in Saudi Arabia,

1307
00:50:52.131 --> 00:50:54.671
and there's one going in soon in New Zealand,

1308
00:50:54.671 --> 00:50:56.591
another one in Northern Canada,

1309
00:50:56.591 --> 00:50:59.351
and another one in South Africa.

1310
00:50:59.351 --> 00:51:02.631
So our scientists know where they want these to be

1311
00:51:02.631 --> 00:51:04.291
so that they create a network of them,

1312
00:51:04.291 --> 00:51:06.171
and we eventually need 12 to be able to get

1313
00:51:06.171 --> 00:51:08.731
a complete picture, ground-based picture

1314
00:51:08.731 --> 00:51:10.191
of these earth fields.

1315
00:51:10.191 --> 00:51:12.511
First time it's ever been done.

1316
00:51:12.511 --> 00:51:14.131
It's been looked at from outer space

1317
00:51:14.131 --> 00:51:15.891
but nobody's built a ground-based system

1318
00:51:15.891 --> 00:51:17.171
that's looking at these fields.

1319
00:51:17.171 --> 00:51:20.431
And so it's something that normally a government

1320
00:51:20.431 --> 00:51:22.691
or a big university or something would do

1321
00:51:22.691 --> 00:51:27.311
and we're a nonprofit, part of our organization is nonprofit

1322
00:51:27.311 --> 00:51:29.771
and nonprofit organization in Northern California

1323
00:51:29.771 --> 00:51:31.351
that's doing it.

1324
00:51:31.351 --> 00:51:35.251
The goal is to have a system where we can study these things

1325
00:51:35.251 --> 00:51:38.451
and do experiments to show that when we come together,

1326
00:51:38.451 --> 00:51:41.631
when we are more coherent and we put out positive intention,

1327
00:51:41.631 --> 00:51:45.411
positive emotions that we may see an impact in those fields.

1328
00:51:45.411 --> 00:51:47.831
We also can look at the seismic activity

1329
00:51:47.831 --> 00:51:50.391
just like Dr. Rauscher was looking at;

1330
00:51:50.391 --> 00:51:53.731
we can also look at the effect of major planetary events,

1331
00:51:53.731 --> 00:51:55.651
let's say we have another big terrorist attack

1332
00:51:55.651 --> 00:51:57.811
or natural disasters somewhere;

1333
00:51:57.811 --> 00:52:00.331
we may be able to see that there was an effect

1334
00:52:00.331 --> 00:52:02.591
in those fields that we can trace back to the fact

1335
00:52:02.591 --> 00:52:05.331
that there was an event that created a lot of emotion.

1336
00:52:05.331 --> 00:52:07.691
So a lot of experimentation to be done.

1337
00:52:09.771 --> 00:52:12.631
<v ->Many things are being triggered as you're talking here.</v>

1338
00:52:12.631 --> 00:52:16.411
You're talking about the changes in the ionosphere

1339
00:52:16.411 --> 00:52:17.991
and you're talking about emotions

1340
00:52:17.991 --> 00:52:22.991
and are there ionospheric changes that precede earthquakes?

1341
00:52:24.051 --> 00:52:26.352
<v ->That's what Dr. Rauscher said.</v>

1342
00:52:26.352 --> 00:52:28.512
Up to two weeks prior to the time the earthquake occur

1343
00:52:28.512 --> 00:52:32.592
they would begin to see a sensor within 100 miles

1344
00:52:32.592 --> 00:52:36.832
of that quake, they began to see changes in the ionosphere.

1345
00:52:36.832 --> 00:52:39.493
<v ->So if you have an event of some kind</v>

1346
00:52:39.493 --> 00:52:42.693
that creates a mass human response, emotionally,

1347
00:52:42.693 --> 00:52:46.833
and that's interfacing with the ionospheric energies, right,

1348
00:52:46.833 --> 00:52:48.685
resonances?

1349
00:52:49.995 --> 00:52:53.515
I mean, can we extrapolate that a large body

1350
00:52:53.515 --> 00:52:57.895
of human emotion could then create something

1351
00:52:57.895 --> 00:53:02.215
physiological or geologically active such as an earthquake?

1352
00:53:02.215 --> 00:53:03.416
<v ->Really interesting question.</v>

1353
00:53:03.416 --> 00:53:05.376
I've never been asked that one before.

1354
00:53:05.376 --> 00:53:07.126
Really good observation on your part.

1355
00:53:08.016 --> 00:53:10.996
Well that would be a pretty big leap but maybe.

1356
00:53:10.996 --> 00:53:13.776
I think it makes sense if those fields are triggering

1357
00:53:13.776 --> 00:53:16.216
those things that we are impacting those fields.

1358
00:53:16.216 --> 00:53:19.456
We don't know, I think, the impact that we are having

1359
00:53:19.456 --> 00:53:21.136
on what takes place in the earth,

1360
00:53:21.136 --> 00:53:22.516
weather patterns and everything else.

1361
00:53:22.516 --> 00:53:25.156
What are we doing as human beings, en masse,

1362
00:53:25.156 --> 00:53:27.776
that's creating some of the same things?

1363
00:53:27.776 --> 00:53:30.016
There's a lot of experimentation that has to be done

1364
00:53:30.016 --> 00:53:32.796
and for anyone watching our interview today

1365
00:53:32.796 --> 00:53:35.156
I wanna make it clear that one of the ways

1366
00:53:35.156 --> 00:53:36.836
that we're approaching this is to make sure

1367
00:53:36.836 --> 00:53:38.876
that we do it slowly and carefully

1368
00:53:38.876 --> 00:53:40.396
and that we do it step by step

1369
00:53:40.396 --> 00:53:42.746
in a very controlled and empirical way.

1370
00:53:43.656 --> 00:53:44.858
<v Voiceover>'Cause these are big implications,</v>

1371
00:53:44.858 --> 00:53:46.378
everything you say.

1372
00:53:46.378 --> 00:53:49.038
<v ->Pseudo science could take it out and eliminate it.</v>

1373
00:53:49.038 --> 00:53:52.378
I mean, I have a visible role at HeartMath.

1374
00:53:52.378 --> 00:53:54.078
I'm in front of microphones and cameras a lot

1375
00:53:54.078 --> 00:53:56.258
and on stages so our researchers don't even tell me,

1376
00:53:56.258 --> 00:53:58.258
I think, all they know because--

1377
00:53:58.258 --> 00:53:59.819
<v Voiceover>'Cause you'd put it out before it's finished.</v>

1378
00:53:59.819 --> 00:54:01.539
<v ->Yeah, I'd put it out before it's finished</v>

1379
00:54:01.539 --> 00:54:03.039
and then they're gonna do it on paper or something

1380
00:54:03.039 --> 00:54:04.839
and here I am talking about it.

1381
00:54:04.839 --> 00:54:09.039
The experimentation will take time.

1382
00:54:09.039 --> 00:54:11.419
It's not like we're gonna slap a sensor up in the backyard

1383
00:54:11.419 --> 00:54:13.480
and stand around it and pray and see a needle move.

1384
00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.200
I mean, it's more than that.

1385
00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:18.600
We have people on our advisory board

1386
00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:20.220
and one of those is Jack Canfield

1387
00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:21.360
and he said to me one time,

1388
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:22.460
"I think this could be the greatest

1389
00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:25.140
"and most important experiment in the history of the world.

1390
00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:26.840
"Because if you prove this you'll prove that

1391
00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.160
"for thousands of years all of our prayers, meditations

1392
00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.760
"intentions, all these things that we believed in

1393
00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.620
"can actually be measured in terms of their impact

1394
00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:35.460
"on the physical world itself."

1395
00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:39.460
<v ->And in reverse, gives us a real imperative</v>

1396
00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:42.040
to start changing our own levels of compassion,

1397
00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.620
care and involvement.

1398
00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:45.020
<v ->Here's what I'd like to see it go.</v>

1399
00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.600
And again, a lot of road to walk before it gets here.

1400
00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:50.880
What if we learn how to impact those fields in ways

1401
00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.240
that when those fields impact to society

1402
00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.900
it was a positive impact.

1403
00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.540
It wasn't hospital emissions, it was something else.

1404
00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:59.860
We could actually imprint those fields,

1405
00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:02.520
we encode information that would then feedback

1406
00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.960
on how we behaved and how we function

1407
00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.820
as a global society.

1408
00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:07.760
That's what I'm after.

1409
00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.680
That's where I want this to go eventually.

1410
00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.680
And getting the sensor sites in place

1411
00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.640
and all that is a part of it.

1412
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.640
And more importantly, it's how do we get more people

1413
00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.960
to operate in another level of coherence,

1414
00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.900
the baseline of it.

1415
00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.980
And so we're trying to organize as many people as we can,

1416
00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:25.400
get them into program like HeartMastery, et cetera

1417
00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:27.680
so that they can learn tools and techniques

1418
00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.460
and things that are gonna help them

1419
00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:32.360
create another level of coherence in themselves.

1420
00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:35.660
If we get a lot of people doing that

1421
00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:37.640
we think that that can have an impact

1422
00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:39.600
that we can create a baseline of coherence

1423
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:42.800
that will lift all boats.

1424
00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:45.520
<v Voiceover>On an intuitive level, I get you're right on</v>

1425
00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:49.520
on this Holy Grail that you're going after.

1426
00:55:50.581 --> 00:55:52.161
<v ->It's a big deal, it's a big project</v>

1427
00:55:52.161 --> 00:55:54.061
and I'd like to see that happen.

1428
00:55:54.061 --> 00:55:57.181
People ask this all the time, "Where does HeartMath go next?

1429
00:55:57.181 --> 00:55:58.481
"You guys have been around 20 years

1430
00:55:58.481 --> 00:55:59.621
"you've already done all these stuff.

1431
00:55:59.621 --> 00:56:01.182
"Here's where I wanna go."

1432
00:56:01.182 --> 00:56:02.122
<v ->Where do you wanna go?</v>

1433
00:56:02.122 --> 00:56:03.362
<v ->This is where I want it to go</v>

1434
00:56:03.362 --> 00:56:05.802
and this is exciting for me in my life.

1435
00:56:05.802 --> 00:56:07.102
One of the things that I'll say about my life

1436
00:56:07.102 --> 00:56:08.942
that I would say to anybody that gets deeper,

1437
00:56:08.942 --> 00:56:11.322
in contact with their heart is that what happens

1438
00:56:11.322 --> 00:56:13.822
is the ceilings of life go away.

1439
00:56:13.822 --> 00:56:15.002
There's no end to this.

1440
00:56:15.002 --> 00:56:16.022
I don't feel boxed in.

1441
00:56:16.022 --> 00:56:18.202
I don't feel like I've done it already and all that.

1442
00:56:18.202 --> 00:56:19.842
I feel like, "Hey, tomorrow's another day

1443
00:56:19.842 --> 00:56:22.084
"it's more exciting than ever before."

1444
00:56:22.084 --> 00:56:23.284
Anything is possible.

1445
00:56:23.284 --> 00:56:24.944
And no telling where this is gonna go.

1446
00:56:24.944 --> 00:56:27.284
<v ->You're really in connection with the creative flow</v>

1447
00:56:27.284 --> 00:56:28.644
at that point.

1448
00:56:28.644 --> 00:56:31.904
<v ->And days are days and I have lots of things</v>

1449
00:56:31.904 --> 00:56:34.224
that I have to do, a lot of responsibilities

1450
00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:35.704
and some days are better than other days

1451
00:56:35.704 --> 00:56:38.024
and some days I don't feel as inspired as others

1452
00:56:38.024 --> 00:56:40.924
and at this part of life I think it's about finding

1453
00:56:40.924 --> 00:56:43.824
the balance and the flow and all that

1454
00:56:43.824 --> 00:56:46.084
and not getting too excited about the how's

1455
00:56:46.084 --> 00:56:48.584
or to identify with the lows and try to find

1456
00:56:48.584 --> 00:56:52.024
that middle ground as we go through this transitional era.

1457
00:56:52.024 --> 00:56:54.044
And that's certainly true for me in my life.

1458
00:56:54.044 --> 00:56:56.744
Just because I've been a good boy and try to follow my heart

1459
00:56:56.744 --> 00:56:58.085
doesn't meant I don't have issues.

1460
00:56:58.085 --> 00:57:00.745
(mumbles) I have to deal with

1461
00:57:00.745 --> 00:57:04.045
so it's all part of the game of life.

1462
00:57:04.045 --> 00:57:05.305
<v ->Well you're inviting everybody in,</v>

1463
00:57:05.305 --> 00:57:07.605
everyone to be part of it, anyone can go to the site

1464
00:57:07.605 --> 00:57:10.605
and they can connect with the Global Coherence Initiative

1465
00:57:10.605 --> 00:57:13.346
and be part of it if they wish.

1466
00:57:13.346 --> 00:57:14.826
God, I wish you the best in getting

1467
00:57:14.826 --> 00:57:17.706
those extra sensors going and we'll be very interested

1468
00:57:17.706 --> 00:57:21.066
as time goes on to see the implications

1469
00:57:21.066 --> 00:57:23.306
of what we just spoke about a moment ago:

1470
00:57:23.306 --> 00:57:25.626
this earth and human feedback loop.

1471
00:57:25.626 --> 00:57:26.426
<v ->That's right.</v>

1472
00:57:26.426 --> 00:57:28.046
That's exactly where we're trying to go.

1473
00:57:28.046 --> 00:57:30.726
<v Voiceover>Howard, thank you so much for your time.</v>

1474
00:57:30.726 --> 00:57:31.866
<v ->My pleasure.</v>

1475
00:57:31.866 --> 00:57:33.076
We could talk all day.

1476
00:57:36.046 --> 00:57:37.046
<v ->As Howard mentioned,</v>

1477
00:57:37.046 --> 00:57:38.846
you can learn this coherence technique

1478
00:57:38.846 --> 00:57:40.846
via online tools and technology

1479
00:57:40.846 --> 00:57:42.666
or you can begin your own journey

1480
00:57:42.666 --> 00:57:44.666
into a state of peace and awareness.

1481
00:57:44.666 --> 00:57:47.246
However you do it, the planet and our people

1482
00:57:47.246 --> 00:57:50.526
need as many of us possible to actively participate

1483
00:57:50.526 --> 00:57:52.806
in the energy of coherence and peace.

1484
00:57:52.806 --> 00:57:54.626
To connect with the HeartMath Institute,

1485
00:57:54.626 --> 00:57:56.486
go to heartmath.org.

1486
00:57:56.486 --> 00:57:57.406
Until next time.

1487
00:57:57.406 --> 00:57:58.746
Thanks for watching CMN.

1488
00:57:58.746 --> 00:58:01.976
(tranquil music)
