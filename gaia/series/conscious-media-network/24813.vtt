00:00:01.286 --> 00:00:03.877
<v ->Margaret Starbird was a devout Catholic,</v>

2
00:00:03.877 --> 00:00:06.284
a mother of five and a military wife

3
00:00:06.284 --> 00:00:07.993
when she stumbled on some literature

4
00:00:07.993 --> 00:00:09.982
that both frightened her and forced her

5
00:00:09.982 --> 00:00:12.403
to begin researching what she later referred to

6
00:00:12.403 --> 00:00:15.231
as "the lost story of Mary Magdalene."

7
00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:17.460
Aided by her academic background with

8
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.921
a masters degree in Comparative Literature,

9
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:21.264
and the support of her priest

10
00:00:21.264 --> 00:00:23.703
and bible study group, Margaret ultimately

11
00:00:23.703 --> 00:00:26.431
came to understand that the demotion of one of

12
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:28.881
the Bible's most influential women to the status

13
00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:33.136
of prostitute, was both unforgivable and heretical.

14
00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:36.170
Furthermore, she says that misrepresentation of Mary

15
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.819
was intentional on the part of those who revised the Bible.

16
00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:42.397
So convincing was her work, in fact, that Dan Brown

17
00:00:42.397 --> 00:00:45.546
based much of his research into Mary Magdalene's life

18
00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:48.337
in The Da Vinci Code on Margaret's work.

19
00:00:48.337 --> 00:00:50.105
This modest and truth-driven woman

20
00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:53.085
captured our minds and hearts.

21
00:01:01.683 --> 00:01:03.472
<v Voiceover>I only have a couple of questions</v>

22
00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:05.493
to ask you because we're on a really tight lead

23
00:01:05.493 --> 00:01:10.493
and I know that, so how did we, throughout history,

24
00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:15.138
in all the ancient texts lose the Bride?

25
00:01:15.138 --> 00:01:19.657
<v ->I think we lost the Bride in the Christian story</v>

26
00:01:19.657 --> 00:01:21.969
on the day after the Resurrection

27
00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:23.987
because I think there was danger to her,

28
00:01:23.987 --> 00:01:25.928
especially if she was expecting.

29
00:01:25.928 --> 00:01:27.535
The family of Jesus would have taken her

30
00:01:27.535 --> 00:01:30.335
to a place of safety, so that's really the subject

31
00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:33.646
of my Alabaster Jar story that they took

32
00:01:33.646 --> 00:01:35.765
this woman to a place of safety.

33
00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:39.034
It's just a little 20 page piece of fiction

34
00:01:39.034 --> 00:01:41.393
in the beginning of my Alabaster Jar book,

35
00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:43.822
which is nonfiction, but the little story there

36
00:01:43.822 --> 00:01:45.096
tells how this might have happened,

37
00:01:45.096 --> 00:01:47.426
how did we lose the Bride, and I think it

38
00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:49.651
was just a matter of safety for her, and then

39
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:52.406
having lost her they didn't know how to get her back.

40
00:01:52.406 --> 00:01:53.747
<v Voiceover>But would you say there might have also</v>

41
00:01:53.747 --> 00:01:57.562
been ulterior motives of some of the disciples?

42
00:01:57.562 --> 00:02:00.292
It seems as though from what I've heard in your work

43
00:02:00.292 --> 00:02:05.292
that the ancient texts are rife with information

44
00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.986
that basically puts the woman, and puts

45
00:02:08.986 --> 00:02:12.009
Mary Magdalene in a lower light.

46
00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:14.139
<v ->Actually, the texts that I use are</v>

47
00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:16.293
the canonical gospels, there she is

48
00:02:16.293 --> 00:02:18.183
the beloved of Jesus, you can tell that

49
00:02:18.183 --> 00:02:20.379
because on the eight lists she's mentioned first

50
00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.227
on seven of those eight lists of women

51
00:02:22.227 --> 00:02:26.106
that traveled with Jesus, so that's one indication,

52
00:02:26.106 --> 00:02:28.127
the other is that she is the only person mentioned

53
00:02:28.127 --> 00:02:30.915
at the Cross and at the Tomb in all four Gospels.

54
00:02:30.915 --> 00:02:33.765
I don't use Gnostic texts to support my claims,

55
00:02:33.765 --> 00:02:36.074
I claim that she was already recognized by

56
00:02:36.074 --> 00:02:39.782
the entire Pagan world of converts to Christianity.

57
00:02:39.782 --> 00:02:42.182
She was recognized as the archetypal bride

58
00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:45.621
because of the relationship of the

59
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:47.871
Passion narrative and the Gospels to

60
00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:51.289
the ancient liturgies of the sacrificed King

61
00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:53.526
whose Bride meets him in the garden.

62
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.875
<v Voiceover>How did we then get to</v>

63
00:02:55.875 --> 00:03:00.354
where we are now, which in the Bible,

64
00:03:00.354 --> 00:03:02.812
puts women, quote, "in their place"?

65
00:03:02.812 --> 00:03:04.542
How did that happen because now those

66
00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:06.128
are the myths that we're left with

67
00:03:06.128 --> 00:03:07.888
that are really affecting all the cultures

68
00:03:07.888 --> 00:03:09.967
of the world today, not just Christianity?

69
00:03:09.967 --> 00:03:13.028
<v ->I think the setting in the mid-second century</v>

70
00:03:13.028 --> 00:03:18.028
with the conversion of Tertullian to Christianity,

71
00:03:18.136 --> 00:03:20.757
he and some the other church fathers from

72
00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:23.225
that period have terrible things to say about women

73
00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:27.294
and they're coming from a position of

74
00:03:27.294 --> 00:03:31.602
worship of Artemis, and the Montenists

75
00:03:31.602 --> 00:03:35.113
and other, what we would consider, "heretical Christians"

76
00:03:35.113 --> 00:03:39.840
who deny the body and go only with the spiritual and they

77
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.938
say really disastrous things about women in their writings.

78
00:03:43.938 --> 00:03:45.977
<v Voiceover>We're talking about high profile...</v>

79
00:03:45.977 --> 00:03:48.213
<v ->We're talking about the Church fathers.</v>

80
00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.978
We also have the letter of Timothy, 1 Timothy, it says,

81
00:03:51.978 --> 00:03:53.515
"I do not allow women to teach or preach

82
00:03:53.515 --> 00:03:55.214
" or have authority over men."

83
00:03:55.214 --> 00:03:57.708
But yet, in Paul's epistles, we know that the nature

84
00:03:57.708 --> 00:04:00.617
of Christianity at the very beginning, at the outset,

85
00:04:00.617 --> 00:04:04.496
was apostles and the brothers of Jesus

86
00:04:04.496 --> 00:04:07.226
traveling with their sister wives, and what is that

87
00:04:07.226 --> 00:04:09.694
but a partnership, it's missionary couples travelling

88
00:04:09.694 --> 00:04:12.254
together to spread the good news.

89
00:04:12.254 --> 00:04:15.114
<v Voiceover>So Christianity has really had,</v>

90
00:04:15.114 --> 00:04:19.608
at it's core, a position in keeping women down

91
00:04:19.608 --> 00:04:21.568
in terms of authority and power.

92
00:04:21.568 --> 00:04:22.768
<v ->Only after the second century--</v>

93
00:04:22.768 --> 00:04:26.316
<v Voiceover>After the second century, until now.</v>

94
00:04:26.316 --> 00:04:28.382
<v ->The model that Christ tried to implant</v>

95
00:04:28.382 --> 00:04:30.555
was the model of sacred partnership

96
00:04:30.555 --> 00:04:32.253
and his partner was Magdelene,

97
00:04:32.253 --> 00:04:35.012
and it's clear from the Gospels that that's the case.

98
00:04:35.012 --> 00:04:38.462
<v Voiceover>What's happened to us a species?</v>

99
00:04:38.462 --> 00:04:40.851
As a result of this distortion of information?

100
00:04:40.851 --> 00:04:43.711
<v ->The distortion that's set in the second century</v>

101
00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:47.758
silenced women, Mary Magdalene was sent into exile,

102
00:04:47.758 --> 00:04:50.798
physically, in her body, as a historical human being

103
00:04:50.798 --> 00:04:53.088
in the first century right after the Crucifixion

104
00:04:53.088 --> 00:04:55.963
and then later, her voice is silenced

105
00:04:56.739 --> 00:04:59.608
by the Church fathers, along with all other women

106
00:04:59.608 --> 00:05:02.058
who tried to teach or preach in

107
00:05:02.058 --> 00:05:03.828
the second to fourth centuries.

108
00:05:03.828 --> 00:05:06.635
And in the fourth century they actually anathematized

109
00:05:06.635 --> 00:05:08.747
all the Gnostic gospels that had raised Mary Magdalene

110
00:05:08.747 --> 00:05:11.346
up as the beloved, the favorite disciple of Jesus,

111
00:05:11.346 --> 00:05:14.655
who knew him best, after that period then,

112
00:05:15.963 --> 00:05:18.330
her story goes into exile, and with her

113
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.561
every woman on the planet, well,

114
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:23.089
everyone in the Christian tradition.

115
00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:26.259
<v Voiceover>It doesn't appear that</v>

116
00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.008
most of the great religions of the world,

117
00:05:28.008 --> 00:05:30.498
we'll exclude Buddhism, for example,

118
00:05:30.498 --> 00:05:32.857
but other than that it doesn't appear

119
00:05:32.857 --> 00:05:35.107
that women have been particularly elevated

120
00:05:35.107 --> 00:05:38.376
in the last millenia in any of them.

121
00:05:38.376 --> 00:05:40.615
<v ->One of the most interesting books I ever read</v>

122
00:05:40.615 --> 00:05:42.579
was a book by Peter Kingsly called

123
00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:44.096
"The In the Dark Places of Wisdom"

124
00:05:44.096 --> 00:05:46.066
about the loss of the Sophia, because in

125
00:05:46.066 --> 00:05:48.226
the very ancient times the philosphers

126
00:05:48.226 --> 00:05:50.095
were lovers of Sophia, the wisdom of god,

127
00:05:50.095 --> 00:05:51.516
and we even know that Solomon took wisdom

128
00:05:51.516 --> 00:05:54.984
as his Bride, this is a symbolic case of studying

129
00:05:54.984 --> 00:05:57.394
and learning wisdom, but wisdom wasn't just

130
00:05:57.394 --> 00:05:59.764
a matter of books, it was about going into

131
00:05:59.764 --> 00:06:01.712
the unconscious and mining the treasures of

132
00:06:01.712 --> 00:06:05.602
the unconscious through vision, dream, trance

133
00:06:05.602 --> 00:06:10.602
and intuition, getting in touch with reality from within.

134
00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:12.688
Those are the kinds of secrets that we've lost

135
00:06:12.688 --> 00:06:14.749
in our whole western world, and of course,

136
00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:15.927
our western world has spread out

137
00:06:15.927 --> 00:06:18.010
into all corners of the globe as well.

138
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.529
<v Voiceover>What's so beautiful about your work</v>

139
00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:24.100
is that you show this through ancient artwork--

140
00:06:24.547 --> 00:06:25.900
<v Margaret>And Medieval.</v>
<v Voiceover>And Medieval</v>

141
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.488
renaissance artwork, which is just beautiful.

142
00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:30.219
One of them I've seen that I love,

143
00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:32.964
I'd never seen it before, myself,

144
00:06:32.964 --> 00:06:37.964
is in Michael Angelo's Creation in the Sistine Chapel

145
00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:41.284
that God has his arm around Sophia,

146
00:06:41.284 --> 00:06:43.913
the goddess of wisdom, I had never noticed that

147
00:06:43.913 --> 00:06:45.473
because our minds are so conditioned

148
00:06:45.473 --> 00:06:47.301
to see the two fingers pointing.

149
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:49.650
What else have we been missing in some of

150
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.889
the great artworks that we should start looking for now?

151
00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:54.350
I know DaVinci Code's going to have people

152
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.165
all juiced up, and he refers to his research, including you.

153
00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:01.205
<v ->Well, there are many things, the letter X was a symbol for</v>

154
00:07:01.205 --> 00:07:03.764
the alternative Christianity, the Church of Amor,

155
00:07:03.764 --> 00:07:07.003
the Church of Love, as opposed to the Church of Roma.

156
00:07:07.003 --> 00:07:08.392
<v Voiceover>Backward.</v>
<v Margaret>Yes,</v>

157
00:07:08.392 --> 00:07:11.032
and they also call themselves the Church of Enlightenment

158
00:07:11.032 --> 00:07:14.489
and their letter X represented the word "light", lux,

159
00:07:14.489 --> 00:07:17.266
L-U-X, in Latin, and so the letter X was

160
00:07:17.266 --> 00:07:19.998
their representative and we have pictures,

161
00:07:19.998 --> 00:07:21.395
I haven't pointed this out always,

162
00:07:21.395 --> 00:07:23.235
like in Georges de La Tour's painting

163
00:07:23.235 --> 00:07:26.362
where Mary Magdalene is sitting next to a mirror

164
00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:28.172
we have the twin flames there,

165
00:07:28.172 --> 00:07:30.553
they're also represented with a double "X"

166
00:07:30.553 --> 00:07:33.091
which is nothing but the letter "V"

167
00:07:33.091 --> 00:07:38.091
the "blade letter", the lambda from Greek,

168
00:07:39.308 --> 00:07:43.246
makes two "X's", it's like the symbol for the

169
00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:46.634
Free Mason's with their compass and their T-square

170
00:07:46.634 --> 00:07:50.033
it forms the double "X" which is the twin flames.

171
00:07:51.943 --> 00:07:54.330
<v Voiceover>These historical references go back</v>

172
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.238
beyond the time of Jesus and Mary Magdalene as well?

173
00:07:58.238 --> 00:08:01.448
<v ->Some of the symbolism probably does but--</v>

174
00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:02.749
<v Voiceover>Back to Osiris and Isis,</v>

175
00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:05.727
and some of the story, some of the ritual.

176
00:08:05.727 --> 00:08:08.577
<v ->The Song of Songs is actually a rewriting of</v>

177
00:08:08.577 --> 00:08:11.841
the ancient liturgies of Isis and Osiris

178
00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:14.992
and Isis is called "my sister, my bride"

179
00:08:14.992 --> 00:08:17.040
and so is the Bride in the Song of Songs,

180
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.799
so we have a lot of connections, in fact there are

181
00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:22.620
parallel lines in those two pieces of sacred writing.

182
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.456
So we know that the Song of Songs was very important to

183
00:08:25.456 --> 00:08:27.165
the Jewish community at the time of Jesus,

184
00:08:27.165 --> 00:08:31.004
they actually found two copies of that text in

185
00:08:31.004 --> 00:08:34.113
the Dead Sea Scrolls, so the Jewish community loved

186
00:08:34.113 --> 00:08:37.824
the Song of Songs, Rabbi Akiva, the second century

187
00:08:37.824 --> 00:08:40.122
said it was the "holiest of holies", all Scriptures

188
00:08:40.122 --> 00:08:43.742
are holy, the Song of Songs is the holy of holies.

189
00:08:43.742 --> 00:08:46.901
What is it but a representation of God's love

190
00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:49.149
for his people, that's the way they viewed it,

191
00:08:49.149 --> 00:08:51.450
but it's actually very erotic poetry from the sacred

192
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.996
marriage rites of the ancient god and goddess couple.

193
00:08:58.187 --> 00:09:00.475
<v Voiceover>I suppose this period of history is fabulous</v>

194
00:09:00.475 --> 00:09:02.984
because we're starting to dig,
<v Margaret>We are uncovering</v>

195
00:09:02.984 --> 00:09:03.930
all these things.
<v Voiceover>it's like</v>

196
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:04.913
revelations, all these things are

197
00:09:04.913 --> 00:09:08.094
being revealed at this time, and your part in it,

198
00:09:08.094 --> 00:09:10.496
your inspiration in doing this and your drive,

199
00:09:10.496 --> 00:09:13.066
do you have something in you that

200
00:09:13.066 --> 00:09:17.043
goes beyond just intellectual curiosity in this whole thing?

201
00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:20.184
<v ->I came to this because my prayer group</v>

202
00:09:20.184 --> 00:09:22.042
that I was in, my charismatic prayer group

203
00:09:22.042 --> 00:09:23.642
was shown that there was something radically wrong

204
00:09:23.642 --> 00:09:26.630
at the very heart of Christianity from it's foundation.

205
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.208
A design flaw, if you will, and the more we prayed about it

206
00:09:29.208 --> 00:09:30.680
the more convinced we became that

207
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.275
this was the case but we didn't know what was wrong

208
00:09:33.275 --> 00:09:35.624
until I read Holy Blood Holy Grail.

209
00:09:35.624 --> 00:09:37.224
Then when I put two and two together I realized,

210
00:09:37.224 --> 00:09:40.164
okay, what we lost then, was the sacred feminine,

211
00:09:40.164 --> 00:09:42.422
we lost our connection with the Bride.

212
00:09:42.422 --> 00:09:46.051
I firmly believe that the very first Christian heresy

213
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:48.652
was the denial of the Bride.

214
00:09:49.621 --> 00:09:52.329
<v Voiceover>I think most people that have begun to</v>

215
00:09:52.329 --> 00:09:55.361
get onto this trail would certainly agree with you in that

216
00:09:55.361 --> 00:09:57.389
and what do we have to gain now

217
00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:59.989
by starting to bring back the lost knowledge

218
00:09:59.989 --> 00:10:02.508
by beginning to reveal all that has had to be

219
00:10:02.508 --> 00:10:05.694
encoded and hidden from view all these years.

220
00:10:05.694 --> 00:10:07.809
What a shame to have had such a simple

221
00:10:07.809 --> 00:10:11.485
and beautiful and natural aspect of our lineage.

222
00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:13.863
<v ->We lost our birthright, our birthright was to have been</v>

223
00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:16.393
the mandala of sacred partnership

224
00:10:16.393 --> 00:10:18.483
and that partnership exists at all levels.

225
00:10:18.483 --> 00:10:20.861
It's male and female, it's light and dark,

226
00:10:20.861 --> 00:10:24.671
east and west, up and down, it's wave and particle theory

227
00:10:24.671 --> 00:10:27.950
and it's God in us, and that's what we lost

228
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.412
when we lost this connection of Christ and Magdelene.

229
00:10:30.412 --> 00:10:32.131
<v Voiceover>So what do you see, and what do you expect</v>

230
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:36.330
to have happen historically, looking back on this period of

231
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.814
I call it revelations and that all is being revealed--

232
00:10:38.814 --> 00:10:41.831
<v ->It's time for the "nuptials of the lamb".</v>

233
00:10:43.894 --> 00:10:46.227
There's a beautiful stained glass window

234
00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.152
picture on my website but it's also

235
00:10:49.152 --> 00:10:52.752
in a church in Scotland, on the Isle of Mull

236
00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:55.100
a beautiful window showing

237
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.958
Jesus and Mary Magdalene hand-fasted,

238
00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.253
which is a symbol for marriage,

239
00:10:59.253 --> 00:11:01.482
and in the background are the twin towers,

240
00:11:01.482 --> 00:11:03.042
and it goes back to the Song of Songs where

241
00:11:03.042 --> 00:11:06.691
the Bride says, "I am a wall and my breasts are towers."

242
00:11:06.691 --> 00:11:08.491
What's she's saying is that she represents

243
00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:11.221
the city of Jerusalem as the holy city.

244
00:11:11.221 --> 00:11:13.060
This picture, this stained glass window

245
00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.889
actually represents the nuptials of

246
00:11:14.889 --> 00:11:17.227
the Lamb and his Bride, and it's time to

247
00:11:17.227 --> 00:11:20.788
make that the mandala for the Christian story.

248
00:11:21.735 --> 00:11:23.148
<v Voiceover>While this is happening you often see</v>

249
00:11:23.148 --> 00:11:27.736
women almost rebelling because of the fact

250
00:11:27.736 --> 00:11:29.807
this has been suppressed for so long

251
00:11:29.807 --> 00:11:31.676
and almost going full-tilt the other way

252
00:11:31.676 --> 00:11:34.851
and not acknowledging the masculine presence.

253
00:11:34.851 --> 00:11:36.411
Can you talk about that just a bit?

254
00:11:36.411 --> 00:11:37.727
<v ->Yes, you can go off the deep end.</v>

255
00:11:37.727 --> 00:11:39.356
The masculine is represented by the blade,

256
00:11:39.356 --> 00:11:42.225
the feminine by the water triangle

257
00:11:42.225 --> 00:11:43.174
and when you put them together you

258
00:11:43.174 --> 00:11:45.104
have this beautiful garden, the English garden,

259
00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:47.114
but if you have the masculine without the feminine,

260
00:11:47.114 --> 00:11:50.500
you have the desert and things blowing up in the desert.

261
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.539
And if you have the feminine without the masculine,

262
00:11:52.539 --> 00:11:55.193
you have an abyss or a swamp.

263
00:11:56.189 --> 00:11:57.923
What you really want is to get the two together

264
00:11:57.923 --> 00:12:01.661
they are each other's mutual aberration society

265
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:05.057
but they're also a fire and water insurance.

266
00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:06.468
You don't want one without the other.

267
00:12:06.468 --> 00:12:09.787
What you want is the harmony of both.

268
00:12:09.787 --> 00:12:12.416
That's what all people need to integrate

269
00:12:12.416 --> 00:12:14.487
those two aspects in themselves,

270
00:12:14.487 --> 00:12:16.025
the twin flames and yourself, and then

271
00:12:16.025 --> 00:12:17.865
that spreads out into your marriage,

272
00:12:17.865 --> 00:12:19.868
into your home and family.

273
00:12:20.658 --> 00:12:22.828
<v Voiceover>Religions have an awful lot vested</v>

274
00:12:22.828 --> 00:12:26.027
in maintaining the dogma as it is.

275
00:12:26.027 --> 00:12:27.347
<v ->In Judaism, in the first century, there</v>

276
00:12:27.347 --> 00:12:29.389
was no word for bachelor.
(Voiceover laughs)

277
00:12:30.727 --> 00:12:34.516
The word they use now is "ravak" which means "empty".

278
00:12:34.516 --> 00:12:36.857
In Judaism is was disobedience to

279
00:12:36.857 --> 00:12:39.995
the Law of God not to marry and procreate.

280
00:12:39.995 --> 00:12:42.056
<v Voiceover>One clue right there</v>

281
00:12:42.056 --> 00:12:44.146
that Jesus was likely married like all--

282
00:12:44.146 --> 00:12:45.895
<v ->He said he came to fulfill the Scripture,</v>

283
00:12:45.895 --> 00:12:49.073
not to destroy it.

284
00:12:49.073 --> 00:12:50.843
<v Voiceover>If you're looking back,</v>

285
00:12:50.843 --> 00:12:53.272
at this time now, and what you're doing,

286
00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:55.318
what kind of seeds do you see happening,

287
00:12:55.318 --> 00:12:57.757
what do you see with the "DaVinci Code" movie

288
00:12:57.757 --> 00:12:59.556
and just the beginnings in pop culture

289
00:12:59.556 --> 00:13:02.069
of the revelation of this knowledge?

290
00:13:02.568 --> 00:13:04.168
<v ->I don't know what "The DaVinci Code" movie</v>

291
00:13:04.168 --> 00:13:07.866
is going to do, it's a movie about a fast-paced

292
00:13:07.866 --> 00:13:10.836
mystery novel, but I think people go back to

293
00:13:10.836 --> 00:13:12.657
look at the sources that he used,

294
00:13:12.657 --> 00:13:14.726
and actually examine the assertions

295
00:13:14.726 --> 00:13:16.416
that he makes seem a little wild

296
00:13:16.416 --> 00:13:17.554
because he doesn't back them up

297
00:13:17.554 --> 00:13:20.084
but mine are all backed up in Scripture.

298
00:13:20.084 --> 00:13:23.501
<v Voiceover>Do you see religion making a shift</v>

299
00:13:23.501 --> 00:13:26.119
as a result of this, what's going to happen?

300
00:13:26.119 --> 00:13:28.260
You're a good Catholic girl with five kids

301
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.475
and you're a heretic. (laughs)

302
00:13:30.475 --> 00:13:33.173
<v ->A heretic teaches what the Church doesn't teach.</v>

303
00:13:33.173 --> 00:13:35.844
A prophet teaches what the Church doesn't teach yet.

304
00:13:35.844 --> 00:13:37.022
I teach what they taught at the

305
00:13:37.022 --> 00:13:39.693
beginning and have forgotten.
