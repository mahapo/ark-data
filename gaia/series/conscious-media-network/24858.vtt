00:00:00.591 --> 00:00:03.274
<v ->Jean Huston has lived a mythic life, which is,</v>

2
00:00:03.274 --> 00:00:06.280
not surprisingly, the title of one of the 26 books she's

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.480
authored on the subject of human development and mythology.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.500
Her early years put her in close contact

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.880
with Margaret Meade, Helen Keller, Einstein, and others,

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.560
all of whom served to push her out into the world

7
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.400
as a leading thinker of our times.

8
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.430
In this candid interview, she shares her

9
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.553
most profound moments of awakening

10
00:00:23.553 --> 00:00:25.584
and her depths of humiliation that came

11
00:00:25.584 --> 00:00:28.144
from a working relationship with Hilary Clinton.

12
00:00:28.144 --> 00:00:29.924
But mostly she shares how the world

13
00:00:29.924 --> 00:00:34.414
is now waking up in unison.

14
00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:43.284
<v ->You grew up large, in a large environment,</v>

15
00:00:43.284 --> 00:00:46.344
with large personalities, your father in show biz,

16
00:00:46.344 --> 00:00:49.164
and there has to have been some sort of catalytic event

17
00:00:49.164 --> 00:00:51.304
that launched you onto this path

18
00:00:51.304 --> 00:00:53.324
from what could have been a life in show biz.

19
00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:55.844
<v Huston>Yes, it could have been and it was not.</v>

20
00:00:55.844 --> 00:01:00.264
I think it happened when I was about eight years old

21
00:01:00.264 --> 00:01:03.224
and my father said "Hey, kiddo, you want

22
00:01:03.224 --> 00:01:04.844
to come and talk to Charlie?"

23
00:01:04.844 --> 00:01:06.464
Charlie was Charlie McCarthy.

24
00:01:06.464 --> 00:01:09.224
My father was writing these big radio and television shows.

25
00:01:09.224 --> 00:01:11.384
Edgar Burkin and Charlie McCarthy.

26
00:01:11.384 --> 00:01:13.284
Edgar Burkin was a well-known ventriloquist

27
00:01:13.284 --> 00:01:16.044
and Charlie was his dummy, a wise-cracking dummy,

28
00:01:16.044 --> 00:01:17.925
and I loved to go talk to Charlie

29
00:01:17.925 --> 00:01:20.965
because we would trade quips back and forth.

30
00:01:20.965 --> 00:01:23.265
And I said "Yeah, daddy, let's go."

31
00:01:23.265 --> 00:01:26.625
So we went to his hotel room -

32
00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:28.405
my father had a script to deliver -

33
00:01:28.405 --> 00:01:31.485
and we opened the door, and Burkin

34
00:01:31.485 --> 00:01:34.005
was sitting sort of slanted towards us,

35
00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:36.825
didn't see us, he was talking to his dummy.

36
00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:39.005
There's nothing unusual about that.

37
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:40.965
We thought he was rehearsing.

38
00:01:40.965 --> 00:01:43.935
But as we listened, my father said

39
00:01:43.935 --> 00:01:47.265
"I didn't write that stuff," because

40
00:01:47.265 --> 00:01:52.265
Edgar Burkin was asking his dummy ultimate questions.

41
00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.705
"Charlie, what is it truly love?"

42
00:01:54.705 --> 00:01:56.974
"Charlie, where is the soul?"

43
00:01:56.974 --> 00:02:00.774
"Charlie, tell me about the nature of mind.

44
00:02:00.774 --> 00:02:02.174
Where does it come from?"

45
00:02:02.174 --> 00:02:04.254
And this dummy was answering,

46
00:02:04.254 --> 00:02:06.454
his little wooden jaws clacking away,

47
00:02:06.454 --> 00:02:09.494
"Why, Burkin ..." with tremendous answers,

48
00:02:09.494 --> 00:02:11.395
answers that seemed to have been crafted

49
00:02:11.395 --> 00:02:13.615
by the greatest minds of history.

50
00:02:13.615 --> 00:02:14.995
Burkin would get more excited:

51
00:02:14.995 --> 00:02:18.895
"Yes, Charlie, but what is the relationship

52
00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:20.855
of the self to the universe?"

53
00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:22.935
"Well, Burkin ..." you know, these things.

54
00:02:22.935 --> 00:02:25.155
And my father, who was an agnostic Baptist,

55
00:02:25.155 --> 00:02:29.095
couldn't stand it, and finally he just coughed,

56
00:02:29.095 --> 00:02:31.615
and Burkin turned around; he said

57
00:02:31.615 --> 00:02:34.875
"Oh, hello, Jack. How ya, Jeanie? You caught us,"

58
00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:37.255
and my father said "Yeah, and what

59
00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:40.075
in the world are you doing?"

60
00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:42.275
And he said "Well, I'm talking to Charlie.

61
00:02:42.275 --> 00:02:44.495
He's the wisest person I know."

62
00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:47.255
My father said "But, Ed, that's you. That's your voice.

63
00:02:47.255 --> 00:02:49.796
That's your knowledge coming out of

64
00:02:49.796 --> 00:02:51.896
that cockamamie dummy's mouth."

65
00:02:51.896 --> 00:02:55.317
And Burkin said "Yes, I suppose ultimately it is,

66
00:02:55.317 --> 00:02:57.657
but, you know, when I ask him these questions and he answers

67
00:02:57.657 --> 00:03:00.597
I haven't got the faintest idea what he's going to say,

68
00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:03.457
and what he says astounds me with his answers.

69
00:03:03.457 --> 00:03:07.057
It is so much more than anything I know."

70
00:03:07.057 --> 00:03:09.597
And I could literally feel ...

71
00:03:09.597 --> 00:03:11.637
I remember the hair rose my head,

72
00:03:11.637 --> 00:03:14.317
and I felt like my future was there.

73
00:03:14.317 --> 00:03:16.577
I knew something then in my own eight year old way.

74
00:03:16.577 --> 00:03:19.717
I knew that as we are compared to the way we think we are,

75
00:03:19.717 --> 00:03:21.757
we live in a very tiny, small house

76
00:03:21.757 --> 00:03:24.577
within the multiple mansions of our being,

77
00:03:24.577 --> 00:03:26.577
and that part of my life had to be to

78
00:03:26.577 --> 00:03:29.617
explore the other floors, the other houses

79
00:03:29.617 --> 00:03:30.937
in this great mansion.

80
00:03:30.937 --> 00:03:32.207
<v ->What an astounding story ...</v>

81
00:03:32.207 --> 00:03:33.440
<v ->But then two weeks later,</v>

82
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.520
two weeks later I was at my favorite school -

83
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.200
I went to 20 schools before I was 12

84
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.880
because we were always on the road with dad -

85
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.370
and it was a school at which the teachers

86
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.580
had been trained by John Dewey and his associates,

87
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.240
so we learned math through dancing and rhythm,

88
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.400
and we were taken to meet the great elders of the time.

89
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.200
I was even trotted across the river,

90
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.140
and we met Albert Einstein, who I remember

91
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.640
as being very vague with a great deal of hair,

92
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.100
and he had a red sock on and a blue sock.

93
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.960
But on this occasion our teacher said

94
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.340
"Children, today we're going to meet Helen Keller."

95
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.360
And she read to us from that extraordinary piece

96
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.120
of Ms. Keller's writing where she says

97
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.260
"for the first six years of my life, I had no concepts,

98
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.180
I couldn't understand anything,"

99
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.580
because she was deaf, dumb and blind.

100
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.171
<v ->Right.</v>

101
00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:17.401
<v ->And my teacher, Annie Sullivan,</v>

102
00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:20.981
took me to the "I define what needs to be done and do it,"

103
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:22.881
whether it's in the family, community,

104
00:04:22.881 --> 00:04:24.981
the country, the world.

105
00:04:24.981 --> 00:04:28.221
And she said "Jean, it's always better to help."

106
00:04:28.221 --> 00:04:30.681
I'll tell you what I did do, though.

107
00:04:30.681 --> 00:04:33.101
Because of that, I went through a series

108
00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:37.981
of very interesting coincidences and synchronicities.

109
00:04:37.981 --> 00:04:42.981
I was able to then go and work with people with Alzheimer's.

110
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:46.281
<v ->Interesting.</v>

111
00:04:46.281 --> 00:04:47.241
<v ->Yes.</v>

112
00:04:47.241 --> 00:04:49.781
My uncle had - my uncle by marriage - had severe Alzheimer's

113
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:53.541
and he used to just be in his nursing home singing.

114
00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:56.461
And I noticed that the other people around,

115
00:04:56.461 --> 00:05:00.101
the other people around him, started to listen,

116
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:03.241
and I figured something's going on here.

117
00:05:03.241 --> 00:05:07.241
So I began, after my career was sort of ...

118
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:09.941
<v ->I wonder if there was a sort of freeing</v>

119
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:12.521
element to this on some level, embedded in the ...

120
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:15.761
<v ->So what I did was I began to</v>

121
00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:18.853
take the hands of somebody born, you know,

122
00:05:18.853 --> 00:05:21.893
1912, 1913 - this is 12 years ago -

123
00:05:21.893 --> 00:05:26.893
and I would sing to them a song from their early childhood.

124
00:05:28.224 --> 00:05:33.164
"Hush, boy. Don't you cry. Go to sleep little baby."

125
00:05:33.164 --> 00:05:35.524
And then I might go a few years ahead, 1913, 15.

126
00:05:35.524 --> 00:05:40.524
"Every little movement has a meaning all its own.

127
00:05:41.364 --> 00:05:43.384
Every little gesture ..." dah-dah-dah-dah.

128
00:05:43.384 --> 00:05:48.384
1917. "I wish I could shimmy like my sister can."

129
00:05:50.164 --> 00:05:52.974
1921. "Charleston, Charleston."

130
00:05:52.974 --> 00:05:54.984
Anyway, all the way up, and often,

131
00:05:54.984 --> 00:05:57.424
not all the time, but often, I would sing

132
00:05:57.424 --> 00:06:00.504
and their eyes would light up and sometimes

133
00:06:00.504 --> 00:06:02.364
they would start to sing with me

134
00:06:02.364 --> 00:06:04.564
around the 1930s, early 40s.

135
00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:07.964
"The bells are ringing for me and my gal."

136
00:06:07.964 --> 00:06:11.364
"I wish I had a paper town I could call my own"

137
00:06:11.364 --> 00:06:15.024
if they were born, you know, somewhere between 1910 and 1918

138
00:06:15.024 --> 00:06:16.804
or somewhere around that.

139
00:06:16.804 --> 00:06:21.804
And on occasion I would ask a question singing.

140
00:06:21.844 --> 00:06:25.864
"Where have you been and what are you doing?"

141
00:06:25.864 --> 00:06:29.464
And some of them would sing back

142
00:06:29.464 --> 00:06:34.464
and tell me such stories about

143
00:06:34.974 --> 00:06:37.024
these marvelous adventures they were in,

144
00:06:37.024 --> 00:06:39.284
these extraordinary landscapes,

145
00:06:39.284 --> 00:06:41.004
and occasionally, very rarely,

146
00:06:41.004 --> 00:06:43.384
one would be able to make a switch

147
00:06:43.384 --> 00:06:45.984
and be able to talk about here and now

148
00:06:45.984 --> 00:06:47.884
where he or she felt very foggy

149
00:06:47.884 --> 00:06:50.384
and it was very vague and confused

150
00:06:50.384 --> 00:06:51.764
and then in this other realm

151
00:06:51.764 --> 00:06:53.725
where they were doing very well, thank you very much,

152
00:06:53.725 --> 00:06:55.665
as if they were in a quantum mind.

153
00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:58.425
Now, you can say I've taught a lot of nurses

154
00:06:58.425 --> 00:07:00.825
how to do this, doctors not so much

155
00:07:00.825 --> 00:07:03.505
because, you know, they say "nonsense."

156
00:07:03.505 --> 00:07:05.725
A few doctors but a lot of nurses.

157
00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:09.005
Subsequently there's been people writing papers about this,

158
00:07:09.005 --> 00:07:13.065
because it just went out in suggesting

159
00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:18.065
what we tend to do is we pathologize people.

160
00:07:19.345 --> 00:07:20.765
We do not mythologize.

161
00:07:20.765 --> 00:07:22.765
It is also what's going on

162
00:07:22.765 --> 00:07:26.925
because the earth does not work that way

163
00:07:26.925 --> 00:07:29.466
where everything just decays and goes to hell.

164
00:07:29.466 --> 00:07:32.266
Something else was going on, especially with human beings.

165
00:07:32.266 --> 00:07:34.586
It was as if another order of whether you call it

166
00:07:34.586 --> 00:07:37.786
mind at large, a frequency was being touched,

167
00:07:37.786 --> 00:07:41.446
and these people were now no longer constrained

168
00:07:41.446 --> 00:07:43.246
by about what you should see or do,

169
00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:44.926
because that part of the brain just wasn't working.

170
00:07:44.926 --> 00:07:45.806
<v ->Right.</v>

171
00:07:45.806 --> 00:07:47.926
<v ->So that's what I did. That's funny.</v>

172
00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:52.406
I went from the White House to the nursing homes and worked.

173
00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:52.968
<v ->And ...</v>

174
00:07:52.968 --> 00:07:54.478
<v ->And learned a whole lot of things from them.</v>

175
00:07:54.478 --> 00:07:56.249
<v ->Would you say your identification</v>

176
00:07:56.249 --> 00:07:57.870
with the archetypal energy of Athena

177
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.510
really pulled you through and allowed you to ...

178
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.130
<v ->I think there certainly was a level of that.</v>

179
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:02.690
<v ->Yes.</v>

180
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.332
<v ->You know, I cannot pretend ...</v>

181
00:08:04.332 --> 00:08:06.292
<v ->You must have felt like a bruised version</v>

182
00:08:06.292 --> 00:08:07.392
of that for a little while ...

183
00:08:07.392 --> 00:08:08.972
<v ->Very bruised. Very bruised.</v>

184
00:08:08.972 --> 00:08:11.872
<v ->But you have pulled yourself back from that.</v>

185
00:08:11.872 --> 00:08:13.852
<v ->Well, that was a long time ago. It was 12 years ago.</v>

186
00:08:13.852 --> 00:08:14.612
<v ->Yeah.</v>

187
00:08:14.612 --> 00:08:18.512
<v ->And back working with the UN and working with ...</v>

188
00:08:18.512 --> 00:08:20.012
<v ->Living large again ...</v>

189
00:08:20.012 --> 00:08:21.682
<v ->Well, I've been living large for some time ...</v>

190
00:08:21.682 --> 00:08:22.272
<v ->Yes.</v>

191
00:08:22.272 --> 00:08:23.756
<v ->But I mean, for about 3 or 4 years,</v>

192
00:08:23.756 --> 00:08:25.696
it really was devastating.

193
00:08:25.696 --> 00:08:27.916
You know, the press has license to kill.

194
00:08:27.916 --> 00:08:32.916
<v ->Yes, they do. They're killing our minds on many levels.</v>

195
00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:35.496
<v ->Well, they don't tell the full story, you know,</v>

196
00:08:35.496 --> 00:08:37.216
and they're not terribly interested in it.

197
00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:39.676
I mean, there were people who were.

198
00:08:39.676 --> 00:08:41.616
Larry King, for example, is quite wonderful

199
00:08:41.616 --> 00:08:43.936
about going into the deeper story,

200
00:08:43.936 --> 00:08:46.256
but you'd be surprised by the people who didn't.

201
00:08:46.256 --> 00:08:48.496
But, anyway, it's just what happens,

202
00:08:48.496 --> 00:08:49.616
that if you're going to live ...

203
00:08:49.616 --> 00:08:52.556
Mrs. Roosevelt said to me, when I was 15 years old,

204
00:08:52.556 --> 00:08:55.076
16 years old, I guess,

205
00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.856
She said - and she had this interesting voice -

206
00:08:57.856 --> 00:09:00.418
"My dear girl, you must realize,

207
00:09:00.418 --> 00:09:02.338
that you can expect, I suspect,

208
00:09:02.338 --> 00:09:05.498
to have a very interesting professional life.

209
00:09:05.498 --> 00:09:08.778
But remember, my dear, that as a woman in our time,

210
00:09:08.778 --> 00:09:11.818
you can expect to be hurt.

211
00:09:11.818 --> 00:09:16.138
But remember, a woman is just like a teabag,

212
00:09:16.138 --> 00:09:21.138
you put her in hot water and she just gets stronger."

213
00:09:21.818 --> 00:09:26.798
You know, you have to expect that in our time,

214
00:09:26.798 --> 00:09:29.878
that women will get hurt, as we all do.

215
00:09:29.878 --> 00:09:31.998
But women particularly, because we're reversing

216
00:09:31.998 --> 00:09:33.958
the tread of thousands of years, you know.

217
00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:38.278
It is a shock to the cultural psyche, what is happening,

218
00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:42.018
but it may also be one of the single most important things.

219
00:09:42.018 --> 00:09:43.478
<v ->And what, in all of this, is</v>

220
00:09:43.478 --> 00:09:44.998
the field of potential right now

221
00:09:44.998 --> 00:09:46.878
for expansion into the new ...

222
00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:49.418
<v ->Well, we are world designers.</v>

223
00:09:49.418 --> 00:09:52.208
We're in the time of second genesis in terms of

224
00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:56.100
ourselves and the world, the very fact of it.

225
00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.140
As I said, we are rising to a new understanding

226
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.800
of human capacities, we have the diversity,

227
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.400
the harvest of the world's potential.

228
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.300
It's extraordinary, the fact that

229
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.880
all of our social systems are breaking down.

230
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.560
<v ->We need to let go of the collective ego.</v>

231
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.300
<v ->Yeah, getting ego, realizing</v>

232
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.340
that we are not encapsulated bags of skin,

233
00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.840
dragging around dreary little egos,

234
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.280
we are organism environments symbiotic with the earth.

235
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.840
Whole new kinds of social systems are emerging

236
00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.520
that have to do with action between peoples

237
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.420
and nations and cultures.

238
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.220
The "zeit" is getting "geisty."

239
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.800
There's a spiritual revolution happening in our time.

240
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.140
The membrane between the self and other is breaking down.

241
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.400
If we don't live in a state of radical empathy,

242
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.560
we don't live at all.

243
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.920
I mean, the earth herself is calling to us,

244
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.740
probably the cosmos, as well.

245
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.260
These are the times and we are the people.

246
00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.900
Other times in history thought they were it;

247
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:54.550
They were wrong; This is it; This is it.

248
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.792
<v ->Jean, thank you so much.</v>

249
00:10:55.792 --> 00:10:56.112
<v ->Thank you.</v>

250
00:10:56.112 --> 00:10:56.766
I wish you the very best with

251
00:10:56.766 --> 00:10:58.568
your program of social artistry,

252
00:10:58.568 --> 00:11:00.128
and I have a few people in mind

253
00:11:00.128 --> 00:11:02.148
that might want to jump on and really get involved.

254
00:11:02.148 --> 00:11:04.528
Again, I know you're a busy woman,

255
00:11:04.528 --> 00:11:07.348
and I look forward to meeting you again for many years.

256
00:11:07.348 --> 00:11:09.298
<v ->Thank you so much.</v>

257
00:11:11.198 --> 00:11:13.368
<v ->I hope you enjoyed this conversation with Jean.</v>

258
00:11:13.368 --> 00:11:16.608
Please go to Amazon.com or another major book seller

259
00:11:16.608 --> 00:11:18.788
to purchase copies of one of her many books.

260
00:11:20.358 --> 00:11:24.169
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
