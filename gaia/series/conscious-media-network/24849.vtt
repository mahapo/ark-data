00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.855
<v ->The only thing that holds many of us back</v>

2
00:00:02.856 --> 00:00:04.756
from using the power of intention,

3
00:00:04.758 --> 00:00:06.660
prayer, and focused meditation

4
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:08.125
is a belief issue.

5
00:00:08.128 --> 00:00:09.328
Does it really work?

6
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.598
Lynne McTaggart has devoted several years

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.366
chronicling the scientific study

8
00:00:13.368 --> 00:00:15.768
of this phenomenon known as ‘The Power of Intention’

9
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.005
and has come back with an unmitigated “Yes,

10
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:20.906
“it does work.”

11
00:00:20.908 --> 00:00:24.510 line:15% 
(soft music)

12
00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:32.118
As a truly top-notch journalist

13
00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.953
you had come in contact with some of the most

14
00:00:33.955 --> 00:00:35.821
powerful people on the planet in the world

15
00:00:35.823 --> 00:00:39.291
of quantum physics, in the world of parapsychology,

16
00:00:39.293 --> 00:00:42.661
and really honed in on the subject of intention,

17
00:00:42.663 --> 00:00:44.563
which effects every one of us.

18
00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:47.100
And now here we are, ‘Intention Experiment,’

19
00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:51.938
and this is a vast project; how did all of your work

20
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.306
culminate in this?

21
00:00:54.308 --> 00:00:57.443
<v ->When I finished ‘The Field,’ which required that I</v>

22
00:00:57.445 --> 00:01:00.980
talk to quantum physicists all around the planet

23
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:03.983
to try to understand why things like spiritual healing

24
00:01:03.985 --> 00:01:07.286
work and homeopathy work, I put together

25
00:01:07.288 --> 00:01:11.691
all of their work into a synthesis that suggested

26
00:01:11.693 --> 00:01:16.693
that consciousness is a living thing, an actual energy,

27
00:01:16.698 --> 00:01:18.865
with the ability to change physical matter.

28
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:22.801
And this is the unfinished business I was left with

29
00:01:22.803 --> 00:01:24.436
after finishing that book.

30
00:01:24.438 --> 00:01:26.873
I wanted to know, being the kind of

31
00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:30.643
practical person that I am, fact-based person I am,

32
00:01:30.645 --> 00:01:33.513
how far can you go with this?

33
00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:35.381
What can you do with intention?

34
00:01:35.383 --> 00:01:37.850
You know, can I help my children pass their math tests

35
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:39.051
with my thoughts?

36
00:01:39.053 --> 00:01:42.155
And more importantly, can I use my thoughts

37
00:01:42.156 --> 00:01:44.890
to do something to alleviate the vast catalogue

38
00:01:44.891 --> 00:01:46.793
of suffering on the planet?

39
00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:49.295
So I wanted to find out about this,

40
00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:51.130
and I also wanted to know about the mechanism

41
00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:52.998
by which intention works.

42
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.403
You know, what science out there could explain this to me?

43
00:01:57.205 --> 00:01:59.905
So I went back to scientists,

44
00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:03.075
and I also wanted to find out about group thought.

45
00:02:03.076 --> 00:02:05.578
You know, does this magnify when lots of people

46
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.481
are thinking the same thought at the same time?

47
00:02:08.483 --> 00:02:10.583
But the science that I came up with

48
00:02:10.585 --> 00:02:14.853
on that regard was very tantalizing, but inconclusive.

49
00:02:14.855 --> 00:02:17.323
So I was mulling this over one night with my husband

50
00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:18.625
and he turned to me and he said,

51
00:02:18.626 --> 00:02:21.560
“Why don’t you do these experiments yourself?”

52
00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:24.096
And I thought, ‘That sounds really ridiculous,’

53
00:02:24.098 --> 00:02:26.098
because you know, I’m not a physicist,

54
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.501
I’m not any kind of a scientist.

55
00:02:28.503 --> 00:02:30.870
But as I started to think about it

56
00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:32.971
I thought, ‘Well, one thing I do have

57
00:02:32.973 --> 00:02:35.908
‘is a lot of participants in the form of my readers.

58
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.378
‘I’ve got readers all over the globe.

59
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.081
‘So perhaps if invite them to be part of this experiment

60
00:02:42.083 --> 00:02:44.583
‘we’ll have the largest mind-over-matter experiment

61
00:02:44.585 --> 00:02:45.851
‘in history.’

62
00:02:45.853 --> 00:02:48.321
And so that’s what I decided to do:

63
00:02:48.323 --> 00:02:49.788
make it a living book,

64
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.291
so that the book doesn’t really have an ending.

65
00:02:52.293 --> 00:02:54.693
It is all about the science of intention,

66
00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:57.263
and what makes you a master of intention,

67
00:02:57.265 --> 00:02:59.798
and what kind of practical techniques you can use,

68
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.068
but it’s also an invitation for readers

69
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.970
to come on periodically, come on our website,

70
00:03:04.971 --> 00:03:09.971
and work with me working with scientists around the globe

71
00:03:10.145 --> 00:03:13.145
sending intention to particular targets.

72
00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:16.381
And our targets are all philanthropic,

73
00:03:16.383 --> 00:03:18.818
they all have a philanthropic implication.

74
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.153
<v Regina>Mm, and you’re dealing with</v>

75
00:03:20.155 --> 00:03:23.321
some really top-notch scientists and physicists

76
00:03:23.323 --> 00:03:26.391
in this project, and did you have a lot of help

77
00:03:26.393 --> 00:03:28.326
in modeling this to begin with?

78
00:03:28.328 --> 00:03:30.563
<v ->Oh definitely, I mean, I’m not a scientist,</v>

79
00:03:30.565 --> 00:03:33.700
as I say, I might have an idea, but I will go

80
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:36.101
to one of my scientists, and they include

81
00:03:36.103 --> 00:03:37.903
Dr. Gary Schwartz, a psychologist

82
00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:39.905
at the University of Arizona,

83
00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:42.641
Fritz Albert Popp, who is a German physicist

84
00:03:42.643 --> 00:03:44.876
in Neuss, Germany

85
00:03:44.878 --> 00:03:48.280
at the International Institute of Biophysics,

86
00:03:48.281 --> 00:03:53.281
Konstantin Korotkov, a well known Russian physicist,

87
00:03:53.655 --> 00:03:57.123
and now we have Rustum Roy, who is probably

88
00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:59.225
the world’s greatest authority on water,

89
00:03:59.226 --> 00:04:01.226
at Arizona State University.

90
00:04:01.228 --> 00:04:02.728
He’s now come on board.

91
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.230
Rupert Sheldrake is helping me;

92
00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:06.900
the famous British biologist,

93
00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:08.901
and many people like that.

94
00:04:08.903 --> 00:04:12.238
So this is truly a global laboratory.

95
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.171
<v Regina>So where did...</v>

96
00:04:13.173 --> 00:04:16.608
Shall we go back and visit a couple of the

97
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.745
early intention experiments,

98
00:04:18.745 --> 00:04:21.113
just to give a little bit of framework for this?

99
00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:24.150
I love the work that was done with plants

100
00:04:24.151 --> 00:04:25.218
with Cleve Backster.

101
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.820
Some of that was just really interesting.

102
00:04:26.821 --> 00:04:28.353
You want to go back into that for a moment,

103
00:04:28.355 --> 00:04:30.256
and some of what really piqued you

104
00:04:30.258 --> 00:04:31.958
when you got into this subject,

105
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.393
and we’ll just start laying a bit of a framework,

106
00:04:34.395 --> 00:04:36.061
and then we’re gonna jump into your experiment.

107
00:04:36.063 --> 00:04:37.063
<v ->Okay.</v>

108
00:04:37.065 --> 00:04:39.731
Well Cleve Backster isn’t a scientist.

109
00:04:39.733 --> 00:04:44.470
He’s the country’s leading lie detector expert,

110
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:48.406
and he got involved purely by accident.

111
00:04:48.408 --> 00:04:50.876
He was sitting in his office one night, bored,

112
00:04:50.878 --> 00:04:54.013
and he looked over at one of his plants,

113
00:04:54.015 --> 00:04:56.115
it was a dracaena, cane plant,

114
00:04:56.116 --> 00:04:57.250
and he thought to himself,

115
00:04:57.251 --> 00:04:59.251
‘I wonder what would happen if I hooked it up

116
00:04:59.253 --> 00:05:02.321
‘to one of my polygraph machines.’

117
00:05:02.323 --> 00:05:04.990
So he did, and at the time, this is in the 1960’s,

118
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:08.060
polygraph equipment consisted of a set of electrodes

119
00:05:08.061 --> 00:05:11.363
attached to a readout mechanism that

120
00:05:11.365 --> 00:05:15.268
is like a pen describing a sideways “S.”

121
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.470
And if you’re telling the truth it’s a small “s,”

122
00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:19.605
if you’re lying it’s a great, big “S.”

123
00:05:19.606 --> 00:05:23.743
So he attached his plant to this piece of equipment

124
00:05:23.745 --> 00:05:26.913
and he thought to himself, ‘Well, let’s see what happens

125
00:05:26.915 --> 00:05:28.413
‘when I pour some water in.’

126
00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:30.983
So he did, and the plant acted as though it were

127
00:05:30.985 --> 00:05:32.351
bored, you know?

128
00:05:32.353 --> 00:05:33.486
If the plant was a human being

129
00:05:33.488 --> 00:05:34.953
it would be sort of saying to itself,

130
00:05:34.955 --> 00:05:36.555
“Ho hum, ho hum.”

131
00:05:36.556 --> 00:05:38.423
So he thought to himself again,

132
00:05:38.425 --> 00:05:39.758
‘Well maybe I have to do something

133
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.693
‘a little bit more drastic.

134
00:05:41.695 --> 00:05:43.863
‘Maybe I’ll burn its leaf.

135
00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:45.565
<v Regina>(laughs) That’s so cruel!</v>

136
00:05:45.566 --> 00:05:47.066
<v ->I know, absolutely!</v>

137
00:05:47.068 --> 00:05:49.335
And at the very moment he thought that,

138
00:05:49.336 --> 00:05:51.136
the plant went wild!

139
00:05:51.138 --> 00:05:54.640
The readout mechanism started describing this giant “S”

140
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:56.775
as though the plant were stressed!

141
00:05:56.776 --> 00:05:58.545
And he kept thinking the thought,

142
00:05:58.546 --> 00:06:00.045
he went and he got some matches,

143
00:06:00.046 --> 00:06:02.981
he lit the matches, and the plant was going crazy.

144
00:06:02.983 --> 00:06:05.985
So he finally stopped thinking this,

145
00:06:05.986 --> 00:06:08.486
and the plant also calmed down

146
00:06:08.488 --> 00:06:11.891
and the “s” became smaller.

147
00:06:11.893 --> 00:06:14.093
So he thought to himself at that point,

148
00:06:14.095 --> 00:06:16.261
‘What was that?

149
00:06:16.263 --> 00:06:19.431
‘This plant has just read my thoughts!’

150
00:06:19.433 --> 00:06:22.201
So for the next 40 years Cleve Backster

151
00:06:22.203 --> 00:06:26.571
went about trying to figure out what he had just witnessed.

152
00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:29.808
He set up all kinds of experiments, not only with plants,

153
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.578
but with eggs, and yogurt, and bacteria,

154
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.213
even human sperm,

155
00:06:34.215 --> 00:06:35.848
just testing what he thought

156
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.085
to call “primary perception,” which was

157
00:06:39.086 --> 00:06:41.486
the ability of other living things

158
00:06:41.488 --> 00:06:44.090
to pick up and read the thoughts around them,

159
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:48.026
and this kind of transmission and reception

160
00:06:48.028 --> 00:06:51.396
that’s going on all the time between living things.

161
00:06:51.398 --> 00:06:54.833
He had some amazing results.

162
00:06:54.835 --> 00:06:57.836
He had an automated system

163
00:06:57.838 --> 00:07:01.941
whereby he had a little batch of brine shrimp

164
00:07:01.943 --> 00:07:04.310
and at a certain point when he flipped a switch

165
00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:07.946
the brine shrimp would go into some boiling water

166
00:07:07.948 --> 00:07:11.083
and die, and at that moment his plants, who were

167
00:07:11.085 --> 00:07:14.420
hooked up to polygraph machines, would all register

168
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:19.421
alarm, and Backster, who was a great fan of Star Wars...

169
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.228
Used to say, “It was like Yoda, when Yoda says,

170
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.096
“ ‘I feel a disturbance in the Force.’ “

171
00:07:25.098 --> 00:07:28.000
It was like they had felt some kind of disturbance

172
00:07:28.001 --> 00:07:29.735
in the field.

173
00:07:29.736 --> 00:07:31.303
<v Regina>And another part you wrote about,</v>

174
00:07:31.305 --> 00:07:34.340
within his work, which was interesting, was

175
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:36.341
the plants had even come to a point

176
00:07:36.343 --> 00:07:38.210
where they could discern whether or not he was

177
00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:41.613
serious in his threats as to harming them, and

178
00:07:41.615 --> 00:07:43.215
I thought that was very intriguing.

179
00:07:43.216 --> 00:07:47.286
<v ->Very, very unsettling too, because</v>

180
00:07:47.288 --> 00:07:50.456
he was working one day with a famous remote viewer,

181
00:07:50.458 --> 00:07:53.458
Ingo Swann, and Swann wanted to replicate

182
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.995
what Backster had done, so he also thought

183
00:07:55.996 --> 00:07:59.365
about burning the leaf of the plant

184
00:07:59.366 --> 00:08:01.600
and the plant initially registered alarm

185
00:08:01.601 --> 00:08:03.301
on the polygraph machine,

186
00:08:03.303 --> 00:08:06.405
and then it stopped.

187
00:08:06.406 --> 00:08:10.141
And Backster and Swann looked at each other

188
00:08:10.143 --> 00:08:11.876
and said, “What was that?

189
00:08:11.878 --> 00:08:14.113
“Is this a plant learning curve?

190
00:08:14.115 --> 00:08:17.250
“The plant actually knows I’m not being serious

191
00:08:17.251 --> 00:08:19.185
“so it stopped being upset.”

192
00:08:19.186 --> 00:08:22.221
And that also was more evidence

193
00:08:22.223 --> 00:08:24.656
of this two-way flow of information,

194
00:08:24.658 --> 00:08:27.493
and that the plant has some kind of

195
00:08:27.495 --> 00:08:29.695
basic consciousness.

196
00:08:29.696 --> 00:08:33.666
So at the time, I mean no one took Backster seriously,

197
00:08:33.668 --> 00:08:37.169
because as I say he wasn’t a scientist, and it was

198
00:08:37.171 --> 00:08:38.602
many, many years ago,

199
00:08:38.605 --> 00:08:42.075
but subsequently scientists like German physicist

200
00:08:42.076 --> 00:08:44.343
Fritz Albert Popp have discovered that

201
00:08:44.345 --> 00:08:48.546
all living things are emitting tiny, tiny currents of light,

202
00:08:48.548 --> 00:08:51.883
and those currents of light are being picked up

203
00:08:51.885 --> 00:08:55.153
by other living things, and in a sense replied to.

204
00:08:55.155 --> 00:08:58.891
So Backster intuitively understood this,

205
00:08:58.893 --> 00:09:03.893
and had demonstrated it in these kind of crude experiments,

206
00:09:04.731 --> 00:09:08.600
but it took someone like Popp to show that Backster

207
00:09:08.601 --> 00:09:10.201
had been right all along.

208
00:09:10.203 --> 00:09:12.338
And he showed it through this mechanism.

209
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.806
<v Regina>Right, and he’s popping up a lot.</v>

210
00:09:14.808 --> 00:09:18.143
The work of Fritz Albert Popp is coming up a lot

211
00:09:18.145 --> 00:09:20.813
I’m hearing, as I’m interviewing various people.

212
00:09:20.815 --> 00:09:22.748
A lot of his work seems key, because

213
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.783
we’re really going into the realm of light,

214
00:09:24.785 --> 00:09:26.318
slash information.

215
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.420
<v ->Yes.</v>

216
00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:29.421
He is so important, because

217
00:09:29.423 --> 00:09:32.891
he offers us a mechanism by which

218
00:09:32.893 --> 00:09:35.026
thoughts can be transmitted

219
00:09:35.028 --> 00:09:36.928
and can have an effect.

220
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.330
<v Regina>So from there,</v>

221
00:09:38.331 --> 00:09:41.333
do you feel comfortable at this point

222
00:09:41.335 --> 00:09:44.670
kind popping along into the experiment itself?

223
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:47.473
Because there’s a lot within this.

224
00:09:47.475 --> 00:09:49.508
Or would you like to give a little bit more background?

225
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.710
I just had to have you do the Cleve Backster thing

226
00:09:51.711 --> 00:09:53.211
because it’s so visceral and fun.

227
00:09:53.213 --> 00:09:53.980
Everybody can see this one.

228
00:09:53.981 --> 00:09:55.481
<v ->I know, exactly.</v>

229
00:09:55.483 --> 00:09:58.216
Well I guess everybody should understand that

230
00:09:58.218 --> 00:10:01.186
there’s a vast body of research about the science

231
00:10:01.188 --> 00:10:04.490
of intention, and many, many scientists

232
00:10:04.491 --> 00:10:06.058
in many labs around the world

233
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.860
have been able to demonstrate that

234
00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:10.963
thoughts are not only things, but things that effect

235
00:10:10.965 --> 00:10:14.533
other things, and that they’ve been able to demonstrate

236
00:10:14.535 --> 00:10:16.901
through very, very good, rigorous trials

237
00:10:16.903 --> 00:10:20.706
that thoughts can effect sensitive equipment

238
00:10:20.708 --> 00:10:24.110
like random event generators,

239
00:10:24.111 --> 00:10:27.011
which are 21st century tosses of the coin.

240
00:10:27.013 --> 00:10:29.181
Very, very sensitive mechanisms.

241
00:10:29.183 --> 00:10:31.483
And through hundreds of thousands of trials

242
00:10:31.485 --> 00:10:34.153
Princeton University has shown that people

243
00:10:34.155 --> 00:10:36.221
have a small, measurable effect

244
00:10:36.223 --> 00:10:39.625
on these machines in sending them one way

245
00:10:39.626 --> 00:10:41.293
versus another way.

246
00:10:41.295 --> 00:10:44.563
There’ve been wonderful studies done by many,

247
00:10:44.565 --> 00:10:48.600
many scientists showing that we can effect living things.

248
00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:51.103
Everything from single-celled organisms

249
00:10:51.105 --> 00:10:53.505
to full-fledged human beings.

250
00:10:53.506 --> 00:10:56.541
There’ve been fantastic studies showing that

251
00:10:56.543 --> 00:10:58.743
time and space don’t matter.

252
00:10:58.745 --> 00:11:00.580
<v Regina>Just what I was going to ask you next.</v>

253
00:11:00.581 --> 00:11:01.813
Go for it!
(laughing)

254
00:11:01.815 --> 00:11:04.916
<v ->Many studies, like the Princeton REG machines,</v>

255
00:11:04.918 --> 00:11:08.086
it didn’t seem to matter whether or not

256
00:11:08.088 --> 00:11:09.888
somebody was sitting in front of the machine

257
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.323
and sending an intention to it,

258
00:11:11.325 --> 00:11:14.060
or 10,000 miles away.

259
00:11:14.061 --> 00:11:15.426
<v Regina>Again, random event generators.</v>

260
00:11:15.428 --> 00:11:16.795
Just in case.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

261
00:11:16.796 --> 00:11:18.730
They’re random even generators, which are

262
00:11:18.731 --> 00:11:21.133
usually a computerized display of,

263
00:11:21.135 --> 00:11:24.536
say, two images that go back and forth.

264
00:11:24.538 --> 00:11:26.138
Let’s say cowboys and indians.

265
00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.175
The computer will show cowboys sometimes,

266
00:11:29.176 --> 00:11:33.678
indians sometimes, and when left to its own devices,

267
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.616
those images will show up about 50% of the time each time.

268
00:11:38.618 --> 00:11:42.086
When someone sits down in front of it and sends an intention

269
00:11:42.088 --> 00:11:46.125
for, say, more indians, over many, many thousands of trials

270
00:11:46.126 --> 00:11:50.028
they’ve demonstrated that people can produce more indians.

271
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:52.030
But as I say, it doesn’t matter whether or not they’re

272
00:11:52.031 --> 00:11:55.500
sitting in front of the computer, or 3,000 miles away.

273
00:11:55.501 --> 00:11:58.136
And we found that with our own intention experiments.

274
00:11:58.138 --> 00:12:00.873
I’ve done some sending intention with a group

275
00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:04.343
in Sydney, Australia to Tuscon, Arizona,

276
00:12:04.345 --> 00:12:06.945
and we have the same effect as someone

277
00:12:06.946 --> 00:12:08.613
standing in that lab.

278
00:12:08.615 --> 00:12:11.750
So distance doesn’t seem to make any difference,

279
00:12:11.751 --> 00:12:13.451
nor does time.

280
00:12:13.453 --> 00:12:15.588
There’ve been many studies,

281
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:18.423
many, many studies, showing that you can send

282
00:12:18.425 --> 00:12:21.660
an intention today to effect something tomorrow

283
00:12:21.661 --> 00:12:23.461
or three weeks from now.

284
00:12:23.463 --> 00:12:25.430
You can send an intention today

285
00:12:25.431 --> 00:12:28.533
to effect something that occurred 3 weeks ago.

286
00:12:28.535 --> 00:12:31.336
So again, with the random even generators,

287
00:12:31.338 --> 00:12:32.905
it didn’t matter.

288
00:12:32.906 --> 00:12:34.940
Time was irrelevant.

289
00:12:34.941 --> 00:12:36.475
In fact...

290
00:12:36.476 --> 00:12:38.110
The fellow who ran these studies,

291
00:12:38.111 --> 00:12:41.146
Robert Jahn, the former Dean of Engineering

292
00:12:41.148 --> 00:12:43.648
at Princeton University, once turned to me

293
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.283
when I said “How can this be?”

294
00:12:45.285 --> 00:12:47.118
And he said, “Well take time out of it, Lynne,

295
00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.921
“and it all makes sense.”

296
00:12:48.923 --> 00:12:50.388
<v Regina>That’s right, yeah.</v>

297
00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.190
And then you’re getting into hyperspace,

298
00:12:52.191 --> 00:12:54.626
and it gets interesting when you start looking,

299
00:12:54.628 --> 00:12:58.763
looking past time and past space.

300
00:12:58.765 --> 00:12:59.698
<v ->Very spooky.</v>

301
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.900
<v Regina>Very spooky, but we’ll just</v>

302
00:13:00.901 --> 00:13:03.468
say we all understand that there are

303
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:04.470
other forces at work.

304
00:13:04.471 --> 00:13:07.340
So you talk a lot about the zero point field,

305
00:13:07.341 --> 00:13:09.375
and how does the belief in the zero point field

306
00:13:09.376 --> 00:13:11.243
allow for what you’re talking about here?

307
00:13:11.245 --> 00:13:15.146
The non-locality to exist outside of the quantum world.

308
00:13:15.148 --> 00:13:18.783
<v ->Okay, well the zero point field, for anyone who doesn’t</v>

309
00:13:18.785 --> 00:13:23.055
understand this, is the universal energy field

310
00:13:23.056 --> 00:13:25.590
that unites us like an invisible web.

311
00:13:25.591 --> 00:13:29.595
It’s created by the sub-atomic dance that goes on

312
00:13:29.596 --> 00:13:31.430
in the quantum world.

313
00:13:31.431 --> 00:13:34.666
Sub-atomic particles aren’t little billiard balls

314
00:13:34.668 --> 00:13:37.770
like we think of when we study physics,

315
00:13:37.771 --> 00:13:41.273
but they’re more like a vibrating packet of energy

316
00:13:41.275 --> 00:13:43.908
and they trade energy back and forth

317
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.345
a little like a game of tennis.

318
00:13:46.346 --> 00:13:48.813
Energy goes from one to the other constantly

319
00:13:48.815 --> 00:13:52.351
in a non-stop process, and in that process

320
00:13:52.353 --> 00:13:54.986
a theme called a virtual particle gets created

321
00:13:54.988 --> 00:13:56.688
by this energy pass.

322
00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:00.058
It only exists for less than the blink of an eye.

323
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.428
And it’s not much energy really, when you

324
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:06.165
consider that one exchange; only about a half a watts worth

325
00:14:06.166 --> 00:14:10.401
of energy; but if you magnify that by all the energy

326
00:14:10.403 --> 00:14:12.771
exchanges between all the sub-atomic particles

327
00:14:12.773 --> 00:14:14.806
in all the things in all the universe,

328
00:14:14.808 --> 00:14:17.910
you come up with this unfathomable,

329
00:14:17.911 --> 00:14:20.178
enormous energy network

330
00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.815
existing out there in empty space

331
00:14:22.816 --> 00:14:25.216
like a super-charged backdrop.

332
00:14:25.218 --> 00:14:27.586
<v Regina>Isn’t it a field of potential?</v>

333
00:14:27.588 --> 00:14:30.188
<v ->It’s a field of potential, absolutely.</v>

334
00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.891
There’s two really important things about this.

335
00:14:32.893 --> 00:14:37.095
One is, it’s a mechanism by which we are all connected.

336
00:14:37.096 --> 00:14:40.231
Because if we are all trading information at the lowest

337
00:14:40.233 --> 00:14:42.968
nether-most level of our being,

338
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:47.873
then we are connected to the furthest reaches of the cosmos,

339
00:14:47.875 --> 00:14:51.443
because energy waves are infinite.

340
00:14:51.445 --> 00:14:52.778
The other thing that’s really important

341
00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.681
about the zero point field is it’s like a giant memory bank,

342
00:14:56.683 --> 00:14:58.583
because waves encode information when

343
00:14:58.585 --> 00:15:02.220
they bump into each other, and so this energy field

344
00:15:02.221 --> 00:15:06.425
is (stammers) like a shadowed universe

345
00:15:06.426 --> 00:15:09.095
of everything that ever was.

346
00:15:09.096 --> 00:15:12.698
And it’s growing more intelligent as time goes on.

347
00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.068
So we tap into when we have any of those

348
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.338
extra-sensory experiences that we all have,

349
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.040
and don’t know how to name.

350
00:15:21.041 --> 00:15:23.508
We’re tapping into the field.

351
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.611
And when we have instantaneous connections,

352
00:15:26.613 --> 00:15:29.915
as we often times do, here is a mechanism

353
00:15:29.916 --> 00:15:31.416
by which this could occur.

354
00:15:31.418 --> 00:15:32.785
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

355
00:15:32.786 --> 00:15:34.653
Now let’s take it into

356
00:15:34.655 --> 00:15:37.188
your work, your experiment,

357
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.591
the intention experiment now, taking this bit.

358
00:15:39.593 --> 00:15:41.660
And I know that we’ve just barely

359
00:15:41.661 --> 00:15:43.428
scratched the surface, but the reality is

360
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.696
we could sit here and talk for the next 24 hours

361
00:15:45.698 --> 00:15:47.733
on tape, so we’re going to assume that people

362
00:15:47.735 --> 00:15:49.568
are going to pick up the first book,

363
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.603
the original book that you wrote on this called ‘The Field,’

364
00:15:51.605 --> 00:15:53.638
and then move forward into this one,

365
00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.373
and then get all the juicy details about

366
00:15:55.375 --> 00:15:57.141
the historical precedence for this

367
00:15:57.143 --> 00:15:58.910
in the world of science and physics.

368
00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:00.913
So that said, let’s hop forward now to

369
00:16:00.915 --> 00:16:02.681
‘The Intention Experiment’ and where,

370
00:16:02.683 --> 00:16:04.916
once you gathered your team of scientists together,

371
00:16:04.918 --> 00:16:07.586
where you began with this, and how you started

372
00:16:07.588 --> 00:16:10.856
applying it in terms of the numbers of people involved,

373
00:16:10.858 --> 00:16:14.293
the kind of experiments you’re doing, and so forth.

374
00:16:14.295 --> 00:16:17.261
<v ->I started with a pilot study that I wanted to include</v>

375
00:16:17.263 --> 00:16:20.800
in the book, and I had to say to myself

376
00:16:20.801 --> 00:16:22.266
and say to the readers,

377
00:16:22.268 --> 00:16:24.136
“I don’t know if this is gonna work.

378
00:16:24.138 --> 00:16:26.205
“This is something that hasn’t been tried before

379
00:16:26.206 --> 00:16:28.540
“on this level, let’s just give it a go.”

380
00:16:28.541 --> 00:16:32.845
So I started out with 16 experienced meditators,

381
00:16:32.846 --> 00:16:35.981
and I took experienced meditators because

382
00:16:35.983 --> 00:16:38.816
it was apparent to me from the research I had done

383
00:16:38.818 --> 00:16:43.321
in the Intention Experiment that experience counts.

384
00:16:43.323 --> 00:16:45.825
That there are certain techniques that make one

385
00:16:45.826 --> 00:16:49.861
a good intender, all shared by masters of intention,

386
00:16:49.863 --> 00:16:53.531
like qigong masters, master healers, buddhist monks,

387
00:16:53.533 --> 00:16:56.568
and I had interviewed many of all that category

388
00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:00.671
to try to understand which one of those techniques

389
00:17:00.673 --> 00:17:04.008
and which batch of techniques worked the best

390
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.111
and were common among all of these groups.

391
00:17:06.113 --> 00:17:08.012
What made you a good intender?

392
00:17:08.015 --> 00:17:12.651
And to distill from that a program that people could use

393
00:17:12.653 --> 00:17:14.586
to improve their own intention.

394
00:17:14.588 --> 00:17:17.589
So with my pilot study I wanted to start with people

395
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:18.723
who knew what they were doing,

396
00:17:18.724 --> 00:17:20.025
they knew how to focus their minds,

397
00:17:20.026 --> 00:17:23.127
because that is one of the key elements,

398
00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:25.630
one of the first...

399
00:17:25.631 --> 00:17:30.101
Elements of any process of using intention;

400
00:17:30.103 --> 00:17:33.371
focusing your mind, getting into a meditative state.

401
00:17:33.373 --> 00:17:37.108
So I gathered them together on a very rainy night

402
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:40.711
in London, and we got together and we sent

403
00:17:40.713 --> 00:17:42.950
intention to four targets in Germany.

404
00:17:43.683 --> 00:17:45.783
And all I did was show my group

405
00:17:45.785 --> 00:17:47.986
photos of the four targets, which

406
00:17:47.988 --> 00:17:50.388
were two kinds of algae,

407
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:53.425
a jade plant, and a woman.

408
00:17:53.426 --> 00:17:55.493
And in each instance we were trying

409
00:17:55.495 --> 00:17:58.696
to effect the light emissions, the bio-photon emissions,

410
00:17:58.698 --> 00:18:01.601
coming off of these living things.

411
00:18:02.836 --> 00:18:04.703
And all we wanted to see was if we could

412
00:18:04.705 --> 00:18:05.836
have an effect.

413
00:18:05.838 --> 00:18:08.673
Now, where I am in London is about 300 miles,

414
00:18:08.675 --> 00:18:11.376
300-400 miles away from Germany, so we

415
00:18:11.378 --> 00:18:13.378
had a distance as well.

416
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.281
Afterward Fritz Popp did the calculations,

417
00:18:17.283 --> 00:18:19.985
and we sent intention on all for 10 minutes.

418
00:18:19.986 --> 00:18:22.721
So if we were having any kind of an effect

419
00:18:22.723 --> 00:18:25.991
we should have a zig-zag pattern.

420
00:18:25.993 --> 00:18:27.358
The scientists also didn’t know

421
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.960
when we were sending intention,

422
00:18:28.961 --> 00:18:30.930
we just gave them a six hour window,

423
00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:35.100
and we sent intention during two of those six hours.

424
00:18:35.101 --> 00:18:37.770
Afterward, after they did their calculations

425
00:18:37.771 --> 00:18:41.106
we unblinded the study and we sure enough had an effect.

426
00:18:41.108 --> 00:18:44.175
Definitely we were effecting all the light emissions,

427
00:18:44.176 --> 00:18:47.445
and I have to say that Fritz Popp was quite surprised

428
00:18:47.446 --> 00:18:49.080
by the results, as was I.

429
00:18:49.081 --> 00:18:50.181
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

430
00:18:50.183 --> 00:18:51.916
<v ->Very interesting thing too, because</v>

431
00:18:51.918 --> 00:18:55.153
the algae in the picture that I showed people

432
00:18:55.155 --> 00:18:58.123
was some algae in Dr. Popp’s office,

433
00:18:58.125 --> 00:19:00.558
not the algae we were sending intention to.

434
00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.426
It was just some algae I photographed

435
00:19:02.428 --> 00:19:04.430
when I went over to see him.

436
00:19:04.431 --> 00:19:07.933
So it seemed from that first little experiment

437
00:19:07.935 --> 00:19:11.836
that any sort of thing, like a photo,

438
00:19:11.838 --> 00:19:15.106
even suggesting the target is enough

439
00:19:15.108 --> 00:19:18.478
to zero-in the mind on the appropriate target.

440
00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.713
So from there, when I wanted to roll this

441
00:19:21.715 --> 00:19:25.183
out to readers, and to conferences,

442
00:19:25.185 --> 00:19:28.186
I spoke to a number of the scientists

443
00:19:28.188 --> 00:19:32.223
and Dr. Gary Schwartz, at the University of Arizona,

444
00:19:32.225 --> 00:19:35.360
very generously came forward and offered to be

445
00:19:35.361 --> 00:19:37.896
and to run these first experiments.

446
00:19:37.898 --> 00:19:41.600
So I started thinking about, and when I had originally

447
00:19:41.601 --> 00:19:43.701
thought of the intention experiments, I started

448
00:19:43.703 --> 00:19:46.371
kicking around things like trying to cure

449
00:19:46.373 --> 00:19:48.440
attention deficit in a child,

450
00:19:48.441 --> 00:19:51.210
or trying to take on somebody with cancer.

451
00:19:51.211 --> 00:19:54.278
Something big, philanthropic; saving somebody

452
00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.913
from a burning building.

453
00:19:55.915 --> 00:19:57.648
Then Gary turned to me and said, “Great.

454
00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.685
“So let’s start with a leaf.”

455
00:19:59.686 --> 00:20:02.386
And I was really deflated.

456
00:20:02.388 --> 00:20:04.021
Totally deflated!
(laughing)

457
00:20:04.023 --> 00:20:06.625
I thought, ‘Oh no, how am I going to...

458
00:20:06.626 --> 00:20:10.595
‘How am I going to ignite the world-mind

459
00:20:10.596 --> 00:20:12.430
‘on fire with a leaf?’

460
00:20:12.431 --> 00:20:14.198
But as Gary—

461
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.168
<v Regina>It’s very methodical this way,</v>

462
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.336
very thorough.
<v ->Exactly.</v>

463
00:20:18.338 --> 00:20:19.605
And he said to me, “Look,

464
00:20:19.606 --> 00:20:21.073
“we’re trying to do something

465
00:20:21.075 --> 00:20:22.775
“that’s never been tried before.

466
00:20:22.776 --> 00:20:25.743
“We’ve got to start with baby steps.”

467
00:20:25.745 --> 00:20:28.013
And so we said, “Okay, let’s just see if we can

468
00:20:28.015 --> 00:20:29.615
“have any kind of effect.

469
00:20:29.616 --> 00:20:32.416
“Let’s do something similar to the Fritz Popp study

470
00:20:32.418 --> 00:20:35.720
“that I had run, but let’s have a control leaf.”

471
00:20:35.721 --> 00:20:38.323
So we decided to do this for the first time

472
00:20:38.325 --> 00:20:40.258
in front of a conference that I was running

473
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.161
in March of 2007.

474
00:20:44.163 --> 00:20:46.665
We had about 400 people in the audience

475
00:20:46.666 --> 00:20:51.666
and we had the two leaves via web-cam images.

476
00:20:51.771 --> 00:20:54.573
We put them up, we had the audience choose which one.

477
00:20:54.575 --> 00:20:57.943
The scientists back in Tucson, Arizona, who have

478
00:20:57.945 --> 00:20:59.978
the two leaves there, didn’t know which ones we were

479
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.813
sending intention to.

480
00:21:01.815 --> 00:21:03.615
And we did for 10 minutes,

481
00:21:03.616 --> 00:21:06.285
and we decided to make our intention

482
00:21:06.286 --> 00:21:09.755
to increase this light, to make the leaf glow.

483
00:21:09.756 --> 00:21:11.991
So we sent intention to just one leaf.

484
00:21:12.558 --> 00:21:16.060
And afterward Dr. Schwartz and his team

485
00:21:16.061 --> 00:21:18.530
put these leaves in special equipment that

486
00:21:18.531 --> 00:21:21.566
not only counts them every photon, you know,

487
00:21:21.568 --> 00:21:24.536
photon by photon it counts all these emissions,

488
00:21:24.538 --> 00:21:27.005
but also can photograph them,

489
00:21:27.006 --> 00:21:28.873
and photograph this living light.

490
00:21:28.875 --> 00:21:30.941
They’re highly sensitive equipment.

491
00:21:30.943 --> 00:21:34.513
So he did this, and after he finished his calculations

492
00:21:34.515 --> 00:21:37.115
I unblinded it, and he said, “Wow.

493
00:21:37.116 --> 00:21:38.716
“You should see these results, Lynne.

494
00:21:38.718 --> 00:21:41.820
“The leaf sent intention is truly glowing.

495
00:21:41.821 --> 00:21:44.155
“And the leaf not sent intention

496
00:21:44.156 --> 00:21:46.658
“is dark, it’s even darker than usual.

497
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.895
“There might be some sort of neglect effect here.”

498
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.930
So we were really encouraged by this,

499
00:21:51.931 --> 00:21:54.933
and we then rolled it out on the internet.

500
00:21:54.935 --> 00:21:57.435
We invited people around the world

501
00:21:57.436 --> 00:21:59.938
to take part, and we had over 7,000 people

502
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.873
coming on all at the same time

503
00:22:01.875 --> 00:22:03.208
and they sent an intention,

504
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.578
and similarly to make, in this case I think it was

505
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.781
seeds, to make them glow, we had an effect.

506
00:22:09.783 --> 00:22:11.650
We ran it again in front of an audience,

507
00:22:11.651 --> 00:22:13.951
another audience, we had an effect.

508
00:22:13.953 --> 00:22:17.155
So Dr. Schwartz and I moved on to something

509
00:22:17.156 --> 00:22:18.523
a little more practical.

510
00:22:18.525 --> 00:22:21.193
We wanted to see if we could make a plant grow faster

511
00:22:21.195 --> 00:22:22.428
by sending intention.

512
00:22:23.263 --> 00:22:26.231
So we decided to take four batches of seeds,

513
00:22:26.233 --> 00:22:28.466
so we’d have one batch of seeds that were our

514
00:22:28.468 --> 00:22:31.170
target seeds, and three controls.

515
00:22:31.171 --> 00:22:34.205
And we would pick one of the four sets,

516
00:22:34.206 --> 00:22:35.740
the scientists once again wouldn’t know what

517
00:22:35.741 --> 00:22:38.543
we were doing, and afterward they would,

518
00:22:38.545 --> 00:22:40.578
after we’d sent intention, they would plant

519
00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.481
all four sets of seeds and then measure them

520
00:22:43.483 --> 00:22:46.418
over a couple of weeks to see which ones were

521
00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.453
sprouting earlier and growing fastest.

522
00:22:49.455 --> 00:22:52.390
So we did our first experiment

523
00:22:52.391 --> 00:22:54.158
from Sydney, Australia.

524
00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.893
I was speaking in front of a group.

525
00:22:55.895 --> 00:22:57.761
I was speaking in front of groups all around the world,

526
00:22:57.763 --> 00:23:01.433
so this gave me really a terrific opportunity

527
00:23:01.435 --> 00:23:02.700
to do this.

528
00:23:02.701 --> 00:23:04.501
I had about 500 people in the audience,

529
00:23:04.503 --> 00:23:07.338
we all sent intention to one set of seeds.

530
00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:10.308
We decided it by, you know, somebody

531
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:12.978
in the audience just randomly choosing.

532
00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.713
<v Regina>That one.</v>
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

533
00:23:14.715 --> 00:23:19.653
And afterward Dr. Schwartz planted all four sets of seeds.

534
00:23:20.886 --> 00:23:23.921
I unblinded it afterward, after he’d taken his calculations,

535
00:23:23.923 --> 00:23:26.391
lo and behold: we had an effect.

536
00:23:26.393 --> 00:23:28.426
The seeds sent intention grew much faster

537
00:23:28.428 --> 00:23:30.561
and quicker than the others.

538
00:23:30.563 --> 00:23:32.530
So we did it again

539
00:23:32.531 --> 00:23:34.531
in front of a little group in Rhinebeck, New York,

540
00:23:34.533 --> 00:23:37.501
on the internet once again with thousands of people

541
00:23:37.503 --> 00:23:39.305
from many, many countries around the world...

542
00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.175
With a group of healers in South Carolina,

543
00:23:43.176 --> 00:23:47.278
and each time we had a significant effect.

544
00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.381
But with the healers we had the biggest effect of all.

545
00:23:50.383 --> 00:23:53.485
The plant actually grew twice as large

546
00:23:53.486 --> 00:23:55.620
as the controls.

547
00:23:55.621 --> 00:23:58.523
So that was our first indication

548
00:23:58.525 --> 00:24:02.526
with a scientific study that experience counts.

549
00:24:02.528 --> 00:24:06.130
That using certain techniques as an intention experimenter

550
00:24:06.131 --> 00:24:07.731
really counts.

551
00:24:07.733 --> 00:24:10.468
So I’ve been encouraging people since

552
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:14.740
who have taken part to familiarize themselves

553
00:24:14.741 --> 00:24:17.241
with my ‘Powering Up’ program, as I call it.

554
00:24:17.243 --> 00:24:20.245
Which is this distillation of processes

555
00:24:20.246 --> 00:24:22.713
from master healers and master intenders

556
00:24:22.715 --> 00:24:25.150
so that they can maximize their effect.

557
00:24:25.151 --> 00:24:28.220
<v Regina>Let’s talk about some of the masters,</v>

558
00:24:28.221 --> 00:24:29.386
some specifics.

559
00:24:29.388 --> 00:24:30.688
One example you used that I love

560
00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:32.023
is Muhammad Ali.

561
00:24:32.025 --> 00:24:33.625
But there are others as well.

562
00:24:33.626 --> 00:24:35.326
Let’s just get an example of a few

563
00:24:35.328 --> 00:24:37.996
individuals or types of individuals

564
00:24:37.998 --> 00:24:40.298
you’ve seen just astounding coherence with

565
00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.700
and effect.

566
00:24:42.701 --> 00:24:45.036
<v ->Okay, Muhammad Ali is very interesting</v>

567
00:24:45.038 --> 00:24:48.340
as an example of intention mastery,

568
00:24:48.341 --> 00:24:52.376
because everybody used to discredit and laugh at

569
00:24:52.378 --> 00:24:54.913
his little techniques, and think that this was just

570
00:24:54.915 --> 00:24:59.516
an example of ego, but recently Ali, like many

571
00:24:59.518 --> 00:25:02.286
elite athletes, has admitted that he was using

572
00:25:02.288 --> 00:25:05.623
mind control techniques and affirmation techniques,

573
00:25:05.625 --> 00:25:09.126
or what we would call intention techniques, to win.

574
00:25:09.128 --> 00:25:11.530
Now if you look at what he was doing,

575
00:25:11.531 --> 00:25:15.000
he used just about every intention trick in the book.

576
00:25:15.001 --> 00:25:18.936
For instance, people talk about using affirmation.

577
00:25:18.938 --> 00:25:21.540
I cannot think of a better affirmation

578
00:25:21.541 --> 00:25:23.708
than “I am the greatest.”
<v Regina>Right.</v>

579
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:25.576
<v ->(laughs) You know, you really can’t</v>

580
00:25:25.578 --> 00:25:27.478
think of one better than that.

581
00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.413
But also if you look at his little

582
00:25:29.415 --> 00:25:31.248
rhyming things that he was using,

583
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:32.950
his little rhyming quatrains,

584
00:25:32.951 --> 00:25:34.920
he would say things like,

585
00:25:34.921 --> 00:25:38.023
“Archie Moore is sure to hit the floor at 4.”

586
00:25:38.025 --> 00:25:41.826
And if you actually look and review that fight,

587
00:25:41.828 --> 00:25:44.228
you’ll see that Archie Moore, sure enough,

588
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.263
was knocked out in the fourth round.

589
00:25:46.265 --> 00:25:50.001
So in a sense, Ali was giving himself intentions

590
00:25:50.003 --> 00:25:51.936
in disguise.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

591
00:25:51.938 --> 00:25:54.438
<v ->And he even used a voodoo doll,</v>

592
00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.108
and there’s a lot of lore about negative intention

593
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.976
and voodoo dolls, you know, things like pointing

594
00:25:58.978 --> 00:26:03.978
the bone, that actually are demonstrated to work.

595
00:26:04.183 --> 00:26:07.551
But in this case Ali had a little gorilla in his top pocket

596
00:26:07.553 --> 00:26:10.788
in the Joe Frazier fight, which was the

597
00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.890
“Thriller in Manila” fight.
(laughs)

598
00:26:12.891 --> 00:26:14.558
<v Regina>I remember it.</v>

599
00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.128
<v ->Well he pulled it out every time he saw a journalist,</v>

600
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.063
and he’d start punching it, and he’d say

601
00:26:19.065 --> 00:26:20.398
“It’s gonna be a killer and a chiller

602
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.468
“in Manila when I get the gorilla.”

603
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:24.970
Pow, pow, pow.

604
00:26:24.971 --> 00:26:26.905
And by the time he got to the ring,

605
00:26:26.906 --> 00:26:29.875
Frazier was probably really unsettled.

606
00:26:29.876 --> 00:26:31.776
I think in his own mind he had become something

607
00:26:31.778 --> 00:26:33.278
less than human.

608
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.881
So Ali was using all these kinds of mind tricks

609
00:26:36.883 --> 00:26:41.018
but other elite athletes now routinely use a thing

610
00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.553
called “mental rehearsal”

611
00:26:42.555 --> 00:26:46.223
to focus and prepare themselves, and also

612
00:26:46.225 --> 00:26:50.728
rehearse every move, because they all understand

613
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:54.098
that the mind can’t really distinguish between

614
00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.900
a thought and an action.

615
00:26:55.901 --> 00:27:00.571
And that the body believes that it is

616
00:27:00.573 --> 00:27:02.373
going through the action when it just

617
00:27:02.375 --> 00:27:03.875
mentally rehearses it.

618
00:27:03.876 --> 00:27:06.343
And it makes those same neural connections

619
00:27:06.345 --> 00:27:09.646
to the muscles, so in a sense paves the way

620
00:27:09.648 --> 00:27:11.550
for the action to follow.

621
00:27:11.551 --> 00:27:14.051
<v Regina>Let’s talk about in the spiritual realms</v>

622
00:27:14.053 --> 00:27:17.755
of mastery, and moving into the subject

623
00:27:17.756 --> 00:27:19.756
of coherence.

624
00:27:19.758 --> 00:27:22.526
<v ->Most of the intention masters that I spoke with</v>

625
00:27:22.528 --> 00:27:25.930
and interviewed and sent questionnaires to

626
00:27:25.931 --> 00:27:28.501
used a series of very similar techniques.

627
00:27:29.235 --> 00:27:32.236
They would work on some kind of focus,

628
00:27:32.238 --> 00:27:36.006
and it didn’t seem to matter which technique they used,

629
00:27:36.008 --> 00:27:39.410
whether it was using meditation with a mantra,

630
00:27:39.411 --> 00:27:44.181
or a tone, or drums, or sounds, of their breath,

631
00:27:44.183 --> 00:27:46.618
or their rosary beads.

632
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.286
It all seemed to work, it all focused the mind

633
00:27:49.288 --> 00:27:52.056
away from the chatter of the every day

634
00:27:52.058 --> 00:27:55.593
to a deeper level, and once they were there

635
00:27:55.595 --> 00:27:59.630
they would work hard on uncoupling from the ego.

636
00:27:59.631 --> 00:28:04.068
They moved aside into a more, as some of them described,

637
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:07.138
“impersonal space,” where they had basically

638
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.640
made contact with the field.

639
00:28:08.641 --> 00:28:10.841
So that’s a really important thing too,

640
00:28:10.843 --> 00:28:13.076
is working on techniques that will

641
00:28:13.078 --> 00:28:16.648
shed the ego so that you are

642
00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:18.983
in a sense one with the field,

643
00:28:18.985 --> 00:28:22.186
and you have removed this sense of separation

644
00:28:22.188 --> 00:28:24.956
with which we usually live our lives.

645
00:28:24.958 --> 00:28:28.493
They all talked about using compassion,

646
00:28:28.495 --> 00:28:30.761
sending out their intention from the heart.

647
00:28:30.763 --> 00:28:33.665
It seemed to work best with intention masters

648
00:28:33.666 --> 00:28:38.666
if the subject of their intention had similar beliefs.

649
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.206
It also seemed to work best

650
00:28:42.208 --> 00:28:46.010
when the intention master was feeling well in himself.

651
00:28:46.011 --> 00:28:48.346
I think what’s very important is,

652
00:28:48.348 --> 00:28:50.315
and you see this in many studies,

653
00:28:50.316 --> 00:28:52.083
is the healer needs to be healed

654
00:28:52.085 --> 00:28:54.085
before the healer does the healing.

655
00:28:54.086 --> 00:28:55.286
<v Regina>The lovely thing is,</v>

656
00:28:55.288 --> 00:28:57.355
in chapter 13 of your book you really give

657
00:28:57.356 --> 00:29:00.925
a very, I think, a very coherent description

658
00:29:00.926 --> 00:29:03.228
of how people can go through and start building

659
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.896
this mastery themselves, and not just from

660
00:29:05.898 --> 00:29:08.098
your own experience, but from the experience

661
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.568
of many; some people that have, uh...

662
00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.136
Are well respected in this field.

663
00:29:12.138 --> 00:29:13.738
So I just want to say that.

664
00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.173
Now, once someone reads this book,

665
00:29:15.175 --> 00:29:16.708
if they’re not an experienced meditator

666
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.776
they can go in and start learning how

667
00:29:19.778 --> 00:29:21.311
to go in to these states to be able

668
00:29:21.313 --> 00:29:23.415
to be effective in intention.

669
00:29:23.416 --> 00:29:24.815
So with that said,

670
00:29:24.816 --> 00:29:28.820
let’s go back to your experiment

671
00:29:28.821 --> 00:29:30.256
and where you started going after the plants.

672
00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:33.825
<v ->Okay, in terms of studying?</v>

673
00:29:33.826 --> 00:29:35.826
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->Well, I wanted to look</v>

674
00:29:35.828 --> 00:29:38.630
at other things like negative intention,

675
00:29:38.631 --> 00:29:41.700
because many people ask me,

676
00:29:41.701 --> 00:29:43.701
“Oh, positive intention must be more powerful

677
00:29:43.703 --> 00:29:45.070
“than negative intention.”

678
00:29:45.071 --> 00:29:46.536
And so I wondered about that.

679
00:29:46.538 --> 00:29:49.706
You know, are thought to harm more powerful

680
00:29:49.708 --> 00:29:51.208
than our thoughts to heal?

681
00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:55.680
And sadly, negative intention,

682
00:29:55.681 --> 00:29:57.481
from data that I’ve seen,

683
00:29:57.483 --> 00:30:00.218
is every bit as powerful as positive intention.

684
00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.420
There’ve been many studies of

685
00:30:02.421 --> 00:30:05.356
people asked to kill something.

686
00:30:05.358 --> 00:30:07.391
Now of course studies in a lab

687
00:30:07.393 --> 00:30:11.095
don’t allow us to kill any kind of creature,

688
00:30:11.096 --> 00:30:13.263
much less a human being,

689
00:30:13.265 --> 00:30:15.800
so they’ve had to do them on micro-organisms,

690
00:30:15.801 --> 00:30:17.935
and they’ve found, they’ve done all kinds of studies

691
00:30:17.936 --> 00:30:21.305
on things like e coli bacteria, showing that when

692
00:30:21.306 --> 00:30:24.175
someone sends an intention to increase it,

693
00:30:24.176 --> 00:30:26.911
so a positive intention, that works.

694
00:30:26.913 --> 00:30:28.880
When someone tells them to send,

695
00:30:28.881 --> 00:30:32.116
when someone’s asked to send a negative intention,

696
00:30:32.118 --> 00:30:34.485
to kill it, that works too.

697
00:30:34.486 --> 00:30:36.586
And of course that’s the kind of thing that we use

698
00:30:36.588 --> 00:30:38.723
all the time.

699
00:30:38.725 --> 00:30:41.358
Many patients, with cancer for instance,

700
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.261
told to visualize will send an intention

701
00:30:44.263 --> 00:30:45.696
to kill the cancer.

702
00:30:45.698 --> 00:30:46.831
Or if they have an infection

703
00:30:46.833 --> 00:30:49.433
to kill the micro-organism,

704
00:30:49.435 --> 00:30:51.101
to kill the infection.

705
00:30:51.103 --> 00:30:54.038
So that was really intriguing to me,

706
00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.875
and I wondered how do you protect yourself?

707
00:30:56.876 --> 00:30:58.743
I was really concerned about that.

708
00:30:58.745 --> 00:31:01.145
And there’ve been a couple of studies

709
00:31:01.146 --> 00:31:03.881
examining just that, where they’ve asked people

710
00:31:03.883 --> 00:31:07.451
to maintain a mental block against intention.

711
00:31:07.453 --> 00:31:10.221
Um, where somebody is sending an intention

712
00:31:10.223 --> 00:31:12.523
to them, and they’re supposed to form a psychic bubble

713
00:31:12.525 --> 00:31:13.691
of some sort.

714
00:31:13.693 --> 00:31:16.695
And some of them work and some of them don’t.

715
00:31:16.696 --> 00:31:19.596
So I thought to myself, ‘Well, that’s not very

716
00:31:19.598 --> 00:31:21.598
‘conclusive, and it’s also not a very good thing

717
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.833
‘to do, I don’t think.’

718
00:31:22.835 --> 00:31:25.470
To walk around sort of self-enclosed

719
00:31:25.471 --> 00:31:27.505
in a psychic bubble, sort of separating yourself

720
00:31:27.506 --> 00:31:29.706
even more from the world.

721
00:31:29.708 --> 00:31:33.611
So I started pondering this, and I was very interested

722
00:31:33.613 --> 00:31:36.380
in the work of Dr. John Diamond, who wrote

723
00:31:36.381 --> 00:31:38.483
‘Your Body Doesn’t Lie,’

724
00:31:38.485 --> 00:31:41.886
and had really developed more than anyone else,

725
00:31:41.888 --> 00:31:43.655
earlier than anyone else, the whole concept of

726
00:31:43.656 --> 00:31:45.823
behavioral kinesiology.

727
00:31:45.825 --> 00:31:49.126
Using kinesiology, the muscle testing,

728
00:31:49.128 --> 00:31:51.428
to determine whether somebody is effected

729
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.163
by toxic thoughts.

730
00:31:53.165 --> 00:31:56.366
And Dr. Diamond has a wonderful idea

731
00:31:56.368 --> 00:31:57.868
he calls “the homing thought.”

732
00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:02.840
Which is having someone maintain and keep

733
00:32:02.841 --> 00:32:06.778
aware of the thought that they were put on this earth

734
00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:10.381
to do, the activity that brings them in touch with

735
00:32:10.383 --> 00:32:11.315
the divine.

736
00:32:11.316 --> 00:32:13.751
He calls “cantillation” and and I think this is

737
00:32:13.753 --> 00:32:16.386
absolutely brilliant because he’s done many

738
00:32:16.388 --> 00:32:18.623
thousands of tests on subjects when they

739
00:32:18.625 --> 00:32:20.791
kept that “homing thought” as he calls it

740
00:32:20.793 --> 00:32:25.730
in place, and he’s found that that seems

741
00:32:25.731 --> 00:32:28.466
to guard and protect against negativity

742
00:32:28.468 --> 00:32:29.333
more than anything.

743
00:32:29.335 --> 00:32:31.368
Their arms, when they keep their homing thought

744
00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:33.671
strong, stays strong.
<v Regina>That makes sense.</v>

745
00:32:33.673 --> 00:32:36.808
When you’re connected with the essential

746
00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:38.241
nature of your being.

747
00:32:38.243 --> 00:32:39.276
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

748
00:32:39.278 --> 00:32:41.880
<v Regina>Don’t diffuse yourself or lose yourself.</v>

749
00:32:41.881 --> 00:32:43.246
<v ->Exactly.</v>

750
00:32:43.248 --> 00:32:45.350
<v Regina>Let’s talk about negative self-chat,</v>

751
00:32:45.351 --> 00:32:46.885
which isn’t exactly intention,

752
00:32:46.886 --> 00:32:49.520
but which people participate in

753
00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:52.423
sometimes a good percentage of their waking hours.

754
00:32:52.425 --> 00:32:55.326
<v ->Well you know, I think it does become intention.</v>

755
00:32:55.328 --> 00:32:57.561
I think that’s a really good question because

756
00:32:57.563 --> 00:32:59.996
you know, people think intention has to be this kind of

757
00:32:59.998 --> 00:33:03.400
mental oomph where you’re just projecting your awareness

758
00:33:03.401 --> 00:33:08.401
and really, really efforting to make that thing happen.

759
00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:12.610
And I’m not so sure this is the case after studying this,

760
00:33:12.611 --> 00:33:16.080
because it’s clear that we’re sending out

761
00:33:16.081 --> 00:33:20.016
transmissions all the time with our light emissions.

762
00:33:20.018 --> 00:33:23.453
And it’s clear that a thought is part of that transfer.

763
00:33:23.455 --> 00:33:26.690
So if all of this is clear, most of us are beaming out

764
00:33:26.691 --> 00:33:29.160
negative information most of the time.

765
00:33:29.161 --> 00:33:31.161
All of that negative chat, as you say,

766
00:33:31.163 --> 00:33:34.365
is there like a running commentary.

767
00:33:34.366 --> 00:33:37.201
‘How did you muff that today?’

768
00:33:37.203 --> 00:33:39.703
And that kind of thing, that just negative

769
00:33:39.705 --> 00:33:42.373
self-critical stuff and that judgmental stuff

770
00:33:42.375 --> 00:33:45.008
about other people, and that I think

771
00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:47.278
after a while becomes your intention.

772
00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.846
I think that becomes your life’s intention

773
00:33:49.848 --> 00:33:52.383
if you aren’t careful about it.

774
00:33:52.385 --> 00:33:55.453
<v Regina>That’s a very interesting take on it.</v>

775
00:33:55.455 --> 00:33:57.155
Let’s reverse it to positive and go back

776
00:33:57.156 --> 00:33:59.690
to positive and some of the types of experiments

777
00:33:59.691 --> 00:34:01.425
you and your group have been doing

778
00:34:01.426 --> 00:34:03.895
and some of the effects of it, and also

779
00:34:03.896 --> 00:34:05.196
I would really want to get into

780
00:34:05.198 --> 00:34:08.231
how we can not only participate

781
00:34:08.233 --> 00:34:10.235
with you, but how we can participate

782
00:34:10.235 --> 00:34:13.905
even individually or within our own little clusters too.

783
00:34:13.906 --> 00:34:15.973
Some effective ways to go about that.

784
00:34:15.975 --> 00:34:19.510
<v ->Okay, well, from plants and seeds</v>

785
00:34:19.511 --> 00:34:22.545
we moved onto water, because again I wanted

786
00:34:22.547 --> 00:34:25.216
to move eventually onto some sort of practical

787
00:34:25.217 --> 00:34:28.719
experiment that would heal world.

788
00:34:28.721 --> 00:34:30.955
And I wanted to make it clear that I

789
00:34:30.956 --> 00:34:33.757
decided to do philanthropic targets because

790
00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.493
a lot of people talk about personal manifestation

791
00:34:36.495 --> 00:34:38.896
and of course my book’s about that too,

792
00:34:38.898 --> 00:34:42.300
but I felt that if we’re going to get people together

793
00:34:42.301 --> 00:34:45.034
in a group, I don’t think it’s about winning the lottery.

794
00:34:45.036 --> 00:34:48.237
I think we ought to put people together to try to heal

795
00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:53.239
that catalogue of suffering I was talking about earlier.

796
00:34:53.511 --> 00:34:55.580
I think there’s a lot we’ve got to do together,

797
00:34:55.581 --> 00:34:58.448
and if we can demonstrate we can do some of this

798
00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:01.018
with our thoughts, we can empower people

799
00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:04.088
who at the moment are feeling a little bit lonely

800
00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.291
and they’re feeling very powerless.

801
00:35:07.193 --> 00:35:11.495
So we started with water, and once again

802
00:35:11.496 --> 00:35:13.296
we had to start with baby steps.

803
00:35:13.298 --> 00:35:16.000
I got together with Dr. Konstantin Korotkov,

804
00:35:16.001 --> 00:35:19.470
who is the famous Russian physicist

805
00:35:19.471 --> 00:35:23.306
who discovered and created GDV machines,

806
00:35:23.308 --> 00:35:26.676
which can measure this light and relate it to

807
00:35:26.678 --> 00:35:29.813
the human aura, and he is able to measure this light

808
00:35:29.815 --> 00:35:33.985
in real-time through a very interesting

809
00:35:33.986 --> 00:35:36.853
collection of equipment, and we’ve done experiments

810
00:35:36.855 --> 00:35:39.690
together on the stage where he’s been able

811
00:35:39.691 --> 00:35:43.260
to have someone send love, a positive intention,

812
00:35:43.261 --> 00:35:47.298
to someone else, while this light is being measured

813
00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.501
and show up on the stage that their light is changing.

814
00:35:50.503 --> 00:35:54.805
And similarly when a negative intention is sent to someone

815
00:35:54.806 --> 00:35:57.908
then the light changes too.

816
00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:01.345
So we decided that we wanted to see if we could

817
00:36:01.346 --> 00:36:04.281
effect what is called the “cluster structure” of water.

818
00:36:04.283 --> 00:36:06.685
<v Regina>Dr. Masaru Emoto’s work and such?</v>

819
00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.786
<v ->In this case without doing crystals,</v>

820
00:36:09.788 --> 00:36:13.758
as Emote does, but looking at um...

821
00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.093
The light emissions from water, cause water

822
00:36:16.095 --> 00:36:19.763
also has light, and water also emits light,

823
00:36:19.765 --> 00:36:22.433
so we wanted to just see if we could change that again,

824
00:36:22.435 --> 00:36:24.701
just to see if we have a subtle change.

825
00:36:24.703 --> 00:36:28.740
So the first, Dr. Korotkov wanted us

826
00:36:28.741 --> 00:36:30.775
to just try sending love,

827
00:36:30.776 --> 00:36:33.043
which is very much like Emoto’s study,

828
00:36:33.045 --> 00:36:34.911
and just see what we could do.

829
00:36:34.913 --> 00:36:37.383
So we did, and we had a big effect.

830
00:36:38.183 --> 00:36:40.316
Then we decided to be a little more specific,

831
00:36:40.318 --> 00:36:42.986
because a lot of my research demonstrates

832
00:36:42.988 --> 00:36:45.255
that being specific also matters

833
00:36:45.256 --> 00:36:47.091
when you’re sending an intention.

834
00:36:47.093 --> 00:36:49.426
We found in our plant study

835
00:36:49.428 --> 00:36:51.695
that it worked even better when we went from

836
00:36:51.696 --> 00:36:56.400
just a nebulous intention to make a plant grow faster,

837
00:36:56.401 --> 00:37:00.136
to actually sending out a psychic order in a sense

838
00:37:00.138 --> 00:37:02.173
saying we’d like it to grow three centimeters

839
00:37:02.175 --> 00:37:04.208
by the fourth day of growing.

840
00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:07.311
So with Dr. Korotkov we then said

841
00:37:07.313 --> 00:37:09.380
“Okay, we’re going to send an intention to make the light

842
00:37:09.381 --> 00:37:12.183
“increase, to make the light glow, to make the water

843
00:37:12.185 --> 00:37:13.718
“glow and glow once again.”

844
00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:16.920
And we had a larger effect the second time.

845
00:37:16.921 --> 00:37:20.658
So now we’re moving into work with Dr. Rustum Roy,

846
00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.828
this is the water expert at Arizona State University.

847
00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:26.230
He’s the Professor of Material Science.

848
00:37:26.231 --> 00:37:28.733
And we are working on putting together an experiment

849
00:37:28.735 --> 00:37:33.136
that will try to mutate bacteria in polluted water.

850
00:37:33.138 --> 00:37:35.506
And the reason we’ve done this, is bacteria are

851
00:37:35.508 --> 00:37:39.410
very easy, they very easily mutate,

852
00:37:39.411 --> 00:37:41.811
and there have been some experiments

853
00:37:41.813 --> 00:37:45.550
demonstrating that intentions sent to bacteria

854
00:37:45.551 --> 00:37:48.218
can make it mutate faster or slower.

855
00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:52.156
So it definitely has an effect.

856
00:37:52.158 --> 00:37:56.160
So if we can turn bad bacteria into good bacteria,

857
00:37:56.161 --> 00:37:58.128
that will have an enormous implication

858
00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:01.098
for our ability to clean up polluted water.

859
00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.435
So we’re gonna do that, and we’re also working with

860
00:38:04.436 --> 00:38:08.240
Dr. Schwartz on another bunch of series of experiments.

861
00:38:09.441 --> 00:38:11.675
We’ve been in touch with Deepak Chopra

862
00:38:11.676 --> 00:38:13.076
and the Alliance for New Humanity,

863
00:38:13.078 --> 00:38:14.945
who are very interested in working with us

864
00:38:14.946 --> 00:38:16.880
in a new experiment that’ll be

865
00:38:16.881 --> 00:38:19.883
a peace experiment, where we are sending intention

866
00:38:19.885 --> 00:38:22.453
to a particular hot spot in the world,

867
00:38:22.455 --> 00:38:24.655
and seeing if we can lower the crime rate

868
00:38:24.656 --> 00:38:26.756
through sending intention.

869
00:38:26.758 --> 00:38:29.026
Now this is kind of similar to some work

870
00:38:29.028 --> 00:38:30.961
that was done by the TM organization.

871
00:38:30.963 --> 00:38:31.595
<v Regina>John Hagelin, yes.</v>

872
00:38:31.596 --> 00:38:35.398
<v ->Yeah, but in that case there was no intentions</v>

873
00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:39.370
set, it was just numbers of meditators

874
00:38:39.371 --> 00:38:41.405
in a certain area, and they found if there were

875
00:38:41.406 --> 00:38:44.641
a certain percentage of meditators in one of

876
00:38:44.643 --> 00:38:47.278
48, I mean they did this in 48 cities,

877
00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.213
if there were a certain percentage of meditators

878
00:38:50.215 --> 00:38:52.015
the crime rate went down.

879
00:38:52.016 --> 00:38:53.650
So now we’re going to see what happens

880
00:38:53.651 --> 00:38:56.320
if we gather together thousands of people

881
00:38:56.321 --> 00:38:59.456
and send an intention, a specific intention,

882
00:38:59.458 --> 00:39:02.426
to lower the crime rate by a specific amount.

883
00:39:02.428 --> 00:39:04.328
So that’s in process, and we’ve been also

884
00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:07.231
talking with an association of New Thought Churches,

885
00:39:07.233 --> 00:39:09.566
who would like to get involved as well.

886
00:39:09.568 --> 00:39:12.370
So this is going to be, we hope,

887
00:39:12.371 --> 00:39:14.105
a massive experiment.

888
00:39:14.106 --> 00:39:14.971
<v Regina>Now do you have clusters</v>

889
00:39:14.973 --> 00:39:17.275
of people doing different experiments

890
00:39:17.276 --> 00:39:20.476
at the same time, or at a certain point

891
00:39:20.478 --> 00:39:22.780
I don’t know if you’re still calling it experiments,

892
00:39:22.781 --> 00:39:25.950
or just simply working together in sending intention

893
00:39:25.951 --> 00:39:27.885
for healing purposes or what not.

894
00:39:27.886 --> 00:39:31.421
Are each of the studies very controlled at this point still?

895
00:39:31.423 --> 00:39:33.823
<v ->Okay, well the experiments themselves</v>

896
00:39:33.825 --> 00:39:36.060
are highly controlled in that we

897
00:39:36.061 --> 00:39:38.896
are conducting them like any scientific trial

898
00:39:38.898 --> 00:39:41.765
with controls, with certain

899
00:39:41.766 --> 00:39:44.768
very specific scientific parameters.

900
00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:46.936
But I’ve also encouraged people

901
00:39:46.938 --> 00:39:50.275
to do their own informal intention experiments.

902
00:39:51.443 --> 00:39:53.643
For instance on our website

903
00:39:53.645 --> 00:39:57.515
people have begun sending intention to each other

904
00:39:57.516 --> 00:39:59.916
and we also have an intention of the week.

905
00:39:59.918 --> 00:40:04.088
Now, this grew out of a situation that came about

906
00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:05.790
from one of our readers.

907
00:40:05.791 --> 00:40:08.691
His name is Don, and he was a Vietnam Vet

908
00:40:08.693 --> 00:40:12.696
and he has ankylosing spondylitis, which means

909
00:40:12.698 --> 00:40:15.700
his spine his fused and he can’t move at all.

910
00:40:15.701 --> 00:40:18.135
And he wrote in one time and just said,

911
00:40:18.136 --> 00:40:20.270
“I’ll be an intention experiment.

912
00:40:20.271 --> 00:40:22.306
“I’ve had so many medical tests.

913
00:40:22.308 --> 00:40:25.441
“I know exactly what’s possible and what isn’t

914
00:40:25.443 --> 00:40:26.976
“so any change from this would be

915
00:40:26.978 --> 00:40:28.946
“demonstrable effect.”

916
00:40:28.948 --> 00:40:32.115
So the readers themselves got together and started

917
00:40:32.116 --> 00:40:35.251
sending him intention twice a week on their own back,

918
00:40:35.253 --> 00:40:37.321
and I encouraged them to keep a diary.

919
00:40:37.323 --> 00:40:39.923
And he was also full of a lot of pain.

920
00:40:39.925 --> 00:40:43.426
So in a few months, or a few weeks, he said he was

921
00:40:43.428 --> 00:40:45.095
getting better.

922
00:40:45.096 --> 00:40:47.163
Something like six to eight months later

923
00:40:47.165 --> 00:40:50.566
he wrote me back to say he is now virtually pain free,

924
00:40:50.568 --> 00:40:53.703
and he has started to move.

925
00:40:53.705 --> 00:40:55.806
So that was interesting.

926
00:40:55.808 --> 00:40:58.375
So it suggested to us to start

927
00:40:58.376 --> 00:41:00.410
setting up a cyber prayer group.

928
00:41:00.411 --> 00:41:03.380
So every Saturday we put up someone else who is

929
00:41:03.381 --> 00:41:06.350
ill, or is estranged from their family,

930
00:41:06.351 --> 00:41:07.651
or something like that,

931
00:41:07.653 --> 00:41:10.286
and we’ve had two people with cancer

932
00:41:10.288 --> 00:41:12.790
claim that they’ve had spontaneous remissions.

933
00:41:12.791 --> 00:41:14.991
We had a guy going through an operation

934
00:41:14.993 --> 00:41:17.126
who was much better as a result.

935
00:41:17.128 --> 00:41:18.895
He did far better.

936
00:41:18.896 --> 00:41:20.030
We have a couple of MS people

937
00:41:20.031 --> 00:41:21.398
who have done really well.

938
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.901
And we have a woman whose daughter ran away,

939
00:41:24.903 --> 00:41:26.436
16 year old daughter ran away.

940
00:41:26.438 --> 00:41:29.040
They were estranged, and three weeks after

941
00:41:29.041 --> 00:41:30.941
we sent our intention she came home,

942
00:41:30.943 --> 00:41:33.810
they started talking, and she went from

943
00:41:33.811 --> 00:41:35.311
a very angry young girl

944
00:41:35.313 --> 00:41:37.848
with a really angry MySpace page

945
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:41.151
to she converted her MySpace page

946
00:41:41.153 --> 00:41:43.853
to pink, so...
(laughing)

947
00:41:43.855 --> 00:41:45.823
I loved that.

948
00:41:45.825 --> 00:41:47.290
I thought that was wonderful.

949
00:41:47.291 --> 00:41:50.360
<v Regina>So with a group,</v>

950
00:41:50.361 --> 00:41:53.430
people can, obviously there’s a mechanism

951
00:41:53.431 --> 00:41:55.131
here where people can join in with you,

952
00:41:55.133 --> 00:41:57.435
and they can join with each other.

953
00:41:57.436 --> 00:41:59.503
Let’s take it home to a really personal level.

954
00:41:59.505 --> 00:42:03.906
Let’s say my mother was ill or not feeling well,

955
00:42:03.908 --> 00:42:06.143
and I want to directly impact her.

956
00:42:06.145 --> 00:42:08.845
How do you advise the individual

957
00:42:08.846 --> 00:42:10.480
or walk them through the process

958
00:42:10.481 --> 00:42:13.583
of really clean and powerful intention?

959
00:42:13.585 --> 00:42:15.051
<v ->Okay, well first of all</v>

960
00:42:15.053 --> 00:42:17.988
I suggest that they try to take,

961
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:20.456
they create their own experiment at home.

962
00:42:20.458 --> 00:42:22.158
So they take something in their life

963
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.695
that never happens, never happens,

964
00:42:24.696 --> 00:42:26.963
so that if they send an intention

965
00:42:26.965 --> 00:42:30.500
it’s more likely to be a result of their

966
00:42:30.501 --> 00:42:32.836
activity and their thinking

967
00:42:32.838 --> 00:42:34.105
than just chance.

968
00:42:34.106 --> 00:42:35.973
So for instance if you’re a woman and

969
00:42:35.975 --> 00:42:37.775
your husband’s never brought you flowers.

970
00:42:37.776 --> 00:42:39.143
That’s a good one.

971
00:42:39.145 --> 00:42:42.278
We’ve sent that a lot, we’ve said that a lot,

972
00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.315
and people have tried this

973
00:42:44.316 --> 00:42:46.050
and it’s been interesting.

974
00:42:46.051 --> 00:42:48.051
I mean, one of the recent Valentine’s Days

975
00:42:48.053 --> 00:42:49.853
I suggested people do this and we have it

976
00:42:49.855 --> 00:42:51.888
as a running commentary on the web now

977
00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:54.225
as to whether or not it’s working.

978
00:42:54.226 --> 00:42:56.393
But I did this at one of my workshops,

979
00:42:56.395 --> 00:42:59.296
and a young woman who said,

980
00:42:59.298 --> 00:43:01.731
who was a participant there said,

981
00:43:01.733 --> 00:43:03.300
“My husband never brings me flowers.”

982
00:43:03.301 --> 00:43:04.635
So I said, “Okay, do it this weekend.”

983
00:43:04.636 --> 00:43:07.938
So she did, and after the workshop

984
00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:09.540
she wrote me and said,

985
00:43:09.541 --> 00:43:11.541
“When I got home I opened up my door

986
00:43:11.543 --> 00:43:15.045
“and there he was with a giant bouquet of roses.”

987
00:43:15.046 --> 00:43:16.580
<v Regina>How wonderful!</v>
<v ->So, yeah!</v>

988
00:43:16.581 --> 00:43:19.015
The power of thought.
<v Regina>That’s right.</v>

989
00:43:19.016 --> 00:43:23.586
<v ->So if you’re a man and you love, say, football,</v>

990
00:43:23.588 --> 00:43:26.656
and you’re being kind of gender, you know...

991
00:43:26.658 --> 00:43:28.058
<v Regina>Biased for a moment.</v>

992
00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:29.293
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

993
00:43:29.295 --> 00:43:32.696
You know, send an intention for your wife,

994
00:43:32.698 --> 00:43:34.298
she can’t stand watching it with you,

995
00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:35.665
send an intention that she’ll suddenly

996
00:43:35.666 --> 00:43:37.166
like football and she’ll sit down and watch

997
00:43:37.168 --> 00:43:39.570
with you, or if you have children who

998
00:43:39.571 --> 00:43:43.240
don’t get to bed on time or don’t make their bed,

999
00:43:43.241 --> 00:43:45.041
or something like that just send an intention

1000
00:43:45.043 --> 00:43:48.111
for that to change around and see what happens.

1001
00:43:48.113 --> 00:43:51.315
So we suggest that, and I also suggest that people

1002
00:43:51.316 --> 00:43:54.185
follow this program I’ve created called “Powering Up.”

1003
00:43:54.186 --> 00:43:56.353
And the reason I call it “Powering Up”

1004
00:43:56.355 --> 00:43:59.423
is because when people assume that when you

1005
00:43:59.425 --> 00:44:02.058
send intention and you get into these meditative states

1006
00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:05.228
your brain slows down.

1007
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:08.231
But the studies show just the opposite of intention masters.

1008
00:44:08.233 --> 00:44:12.168
They show that when they go into an intense intention state,

1009
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:14.971
the kind of state that allows a buddhist monk for instance

1010
00:44:14.973 --> 00:44:19.176
to heat up his body and change his body temperature

1011
00:44:19.178 --> 00:44:22.480
by 17 degrees or something, they’re in a state

1012
00:44:22.481 --> 00:44:25.048
where they start of in a meditative state,

1013
00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:28.485
their mind goes down and slows into an alpha-state,

1014
00:44:28.486 --> 00:44:31.888
and then eventually speeds up past beta

1015
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:35.725
into a gamma-state, a state of hyper-alert.

1016
00:44:35.726 --> 00:44:37.360
I call it “going into hyperspace”

1017
00:44:37.361 --> 00:44:40.230
because in a sense you’re attending

1018
00:44:40.231 --> 00:44:42.265
to this at this moment.

1019
00:44:42.266 --> 00:44:44.903
You’re attending to things with every fibre of your being.

1020
00:44:46.071 --> 00:44:50.506
So we have, I have exercises in my book

1021
00:44:50.508 --> 00:44:55.508
to help people learn this kind of concentrated focus

1022
00:44:56.115 --> 00:44:58.481
and they can practice it just using a little

1023
00:44:58.483 --> 00:45:00.650
mindfulness meditation techniques,

1024
00:45:00.651 --> 00:45:03.920
which are focusing on something that you’re doing

1025
00:45:03.921 --> 00:45:07.190
right there in the present with all your five senses,

1026
00:45:07.191 --> 00:45:08.858
without judgement.

1027
00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:12.663
So it means you turn off the internal monologue

1028
00:45:12.665 --> 00:45:14.531
of what you were doing yesterday

1029
00:45:14.533 --> 00:45:16.333
and what you’re about to do tomorrow,

1030
00:45:16.335 --> 00:45:17.801
or that day, and you just

1031
00:45:17.803 --> 00:45:21.038
focus on what is; what’s going on at that moment.

1032
00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.940
And so that kind of intense mind-state,

1033
00:45:23.941 --> 00:45:27.110
which is hard for us to do without practice,

1034
00:45:27.111 --> 00:45:30.613
is very helpful in becoming a master intender,

1035
00:45:30.615 --> 00:45:33.150
because what you want to do is ultimately

1036
00:45:33.151 --> 00:45:36.220
keep into that focused state, and then

1037
00:45:36.221 --> 00:45:38.488
send your intention.

1038
00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:40.423
Other techniques are important.

1039
00:45:40.425 --> 00:45:43.026
Other techniques that are important include

1040
00:45:43.028 --> 00:45:45.628
choosing your intention space.

1041
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:47.965
I suggest this because there’s a lot of

1042
00:45:47.966 --> 00:45:51.635
laboratory evidence showing that when they do

1043
00:45:51.636 --> 00:45:54.238
mind-over-matter experiments in the lab,

1044
00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.073
it works faster and better

1045
00:45:57.075 --> 00:45:59.610
as time goes on if they can carry out

1046
00:45:59.611 --> 00:46:03.046
those experiments in the same place over time.

1047
00:46:03.048 --> 00:46:05.081
So that suggests to me

1048
00:46:05.083 --> 00:46:08.151
that in a sense you create a sacred space

1049
00:46:08.153 --> 00:46:10.955
when you send intention in a space.

1050
00:46:10.956 --> 00:46:14.558
So it means just cleaning up and clearing up

1051
00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:17.193
one little place in your house,

1052
00:46:17.195 --> 00:46:19.028
or in your office or whatever,

1053
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:20.931
that becomes your space.

1054
00:46:20.933 --> 00:46:24.901
And always sending intention from that space.

1055
00:46:24.903 --> 00:46:27.336
Now suppose you’re traveling.

1056
00:46:27.338 --> 00:46:30.273
You can still mentally travel to your space

1057
00:46:30.275 --> 00:46:32.141
and then send an intention there.

1058
00:46:32.143 --> 00:46:33.045
<v Regina>That’s a very good point, yes.</v>

1059
00:46:34.045 --> 00:46:35.245
<v ->So there’s that.</v>

1060
00:46:35.246 --> 00:46:36.613
There is forming a connection

1061
00:46:36.615 --> 00:46:38.615
with the object of your intention.

1062
00:46:38.616 --> 00:46:41.285
It’s amazing how many people

1063
00:46:41.286 --> 00:46:43.020
attempt to send intention,

1064
00:46:43.021 --> 00:46:45.588
and there have been certain prayer studies like this too,

1065
00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:47.958
where they haven’t worked, and in my view,

1066
00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:50.726
it has largely to do with the fact that

1067
00:46:50.728 --> 00:46:53.396
they aren’t zoned in on the object of their intention.

1068
00:46:53.398 --> 00:46:55.698
I mean, in some cases with prayer studies

1069
00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.536
they’ve asked people sending prayer

1070
00:46:59.538 --> 00:47:04.140
to certain patients without the prayers even

1071
00:47:04.141 --> 00:47:06.276
knowing who these patients are.

1072
00:47:06.278 --> 00:47:08.278
Not even being given their names.

1073
00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.746
So I think it’s important—

1074
00:47:09.748 --> 00:47:11.015
<v Regina>Not efficient.</v>

1075
00:47:11.016 --> 00:47:12.581
<v ->Yeah, no, exactly.</v>

1076
00:47:12.583 --> 00:47:14.951
It’s like dialing your phone without

1077
00:47:14.953 --> 00:47:16.288
knowing your full phone number.

1078
00:47:17.288 --> 00:47:21.358
So um, for me connection is really important.

1079
00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.726
Even if it’s holding somebody’s hand

1080
00:47:23.728 --> 00:47:25.095
for a couple of minutes.

1081
00:47:25.096 --> 00:47:25.961
Imagine what would happen

1082
00:47:25.963 --> 00:47:29.566
if healers, if doctors did this with their patients.

1083
00:47:29.568 --> 00:47:30.300
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1084
00:47:30.301 --> 00:47:33.803
Or even in the case of remote healing,

1085
00:47:33.805 --> 00:47:35.938
having a picture, just something.

1086
00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:37.140
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1087
00:47:37.141 --> 00:47:38.508
<v Regina>A name, a location.</v>

1088
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:40.743
Some kind of identification factor

1089
00:47:40.745 --> 00:47:43.146
where you’re creating relationship.

1090
00:47:43.148 --> 00:47:45.548
<v ->Exactly, exactly.</v>

1091
00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:46.983
That’s important.

1092
00:47:46.985 --> 00:47:49.386
Some sort of connection.

1093
00:47:49.388 --> 00:47:52.490
This concurrence of belief is really important.

1094
00:47:53.358 --> 00:47:55.025
Timing is even important.

1095
00:47:55.026 --> 00:47:59.028
I found a lot of evidence showing that we are

1096
00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:01.665
very much effected by solar activity

1097
00:48:01.666 --> 00:48:04.501
with intention.

1098
00:48:04.503 --> 00:48:07.236
Now, people aren’t aware of this,

1099
00:48:07.238 --> 00:48:11.408
but the sun is furious star.

1100
00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:14.445
The sun hurls a lot of gaseous stuff toward earth

1101
00:48:14.446 --> 00:48:19.446
at, you know, at huge speed, and when it does

1102
00:48:20.118 --> 00:48:23.286
those gaseous things like solar flares

1103
00:48:23.288 --> 00:48:25.388
hit the earth’s geomagnetic shield,

1104
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:27.323
which surrounds the earth like a donut,

1105
00:48:27.325 --> 00:48:30.393
and that in turn has a profound effect on

1106
00:48:30.395 --> 00:48:33.630
two major engines or the human body:

1107
00:48:33.631 --> 00:48:35.031
the heart and the brain.

1108
00:48:35.033 --> 00:48:38.135
It also effects all living creatures too.

1109
00:48:38.136 --> 00:48:41.838
But with us, heart attack rates

1110
00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:44.741
start soaring, blood coagulates,

1111
00:48:44.743 --> 00:48:46.310
people have many more strokes,

1112
00:48:46.311 --> 00:48:49.913
people have more epileptic fits,

1113
00:48:49.915 --> 00:48:51.948
psychiatric admissions increase,

1114
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:53.616
all that kind of stuff happens.

1115
00:48:53.618 --> 00:48:56.320
But it also seems to effect our psychic ability

1116
00:48:56.321 --> 00:48:58.388
and our ability to tap into the field.

1117
00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:02.291
When the sun is quiet and there isn’t much of this activity,

1118
00:49:02.293 --> 00:49:06.496
it seems that we are much better at things like ESP,

1119
00:49:06.498 --> 00:49:10.766
and tapping into that information field.

1120
00:49:10.768 --> 00:49:13.470
When it’s a little bit noisy it seems we have

1121
00:49:13.471 --> 00:49:16.773
a better effect on things like intention,

1122
00:49:16.775 --> 00:49:18.408
on mind-over-matter.

1123
00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:21.478
So I always suggest that people have a look,

1124
00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:23.680
if they have a really important intention,

1125
00:49:23.681 --> 00:49:26.048
have a look at what the sun’s doing.

1126
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:27.583
<v Regina>Go to the NASA site?</v>

1127
00:49:27.585 --> 00:49:28.418
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1128
00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:31.421
And they have a daily record of what’s going on.

1129
00:49:31.423 --> 00:49:32.255
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1130
00:49:32.256 --> 00:49:34.891
That’s a really key piece of information

1131
00:49:34.893 --> 00:49:37.460
that is almost completely overlooked.

1132
00:49:37.461 --> 00:49:40.530
<v ->Yes, and there’s a vast body of research about this,</v>

1133
00:49:40.531 --> 00:49:41.831
and intention.
<v Regina>We’re not separate</v>

1134
00:49:41.833 --> 00:49:43.266
from the cosmos.

1135
00:49:43.268 --> 00:49:44.300
<v ->Absolutely not.</v>

1136
00:49:44.301 --> 00:49:48.105
We are not the ape at the apex of the energy system.

1137
00:49:48.106 --> 00:49:50.706
<v Regina>So to bring it all together here</v>

1138
00:49:50.708 --> 00:49:53.543
and final words on this, because this is

1139
00:49:53.545 --> 00:49:55.945
an ongoing experiment, some of what you’re

1140
00:49:55.946 --> 00:49:58.681
putting together for the future

1141
00:49:58.683 --> 00:50:00.916
and again someone maybe watching this tomorrow

1142
00:50:00.918 --> 00:50:02.920
or a year from now, so let’s really

1143
00:50:02.921 --> 00:50:05.255
look at some of the projections you have

1144
00:50:05.256 --> 00:50:06.356
for this experiment.

1145
00:50:06.358 --> 00:50:08.125
<v ->Okay, well one other thing that we’re doing</v>

1146
00:50:08.126 --> 00:50:12.930
is building a little mini GAIA, like an ecosphere,

1147
00:50:12.931 --> 00:50:17.100
which will be like a glass enclosed terrarium

1148
00:50:17.101 --> 00:50:19.903
housing some animals and plants

1149
00:50:19.905 --> 00:50:22.271
and we’re going to put a lot of measuring equipment

1150
00:50:22.273 --> 00:50:24.875
in there and we’re going to see if we can change

1151
00:50:24.876 --> 00:50:27.543
the CO2 levels, the carbon dioxide levels,

1152
00:50:27.545 --> 00:50:30.080
with our thoughts, if we can change the temperature

1153
00:50:30.081 --> 00:50:32.248
with our thoughts, and that will have,

1154
00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:34.585
once again, an enormous implication,

1155
00:50:34.586 --> 00:50:38.221
because this ongoing little experiment will be

1156
00:50:38.223 --> 00:50:42.625
in a sense a living and practiced demonstration

1157
00:50:42.626 --> 00:50:43.860
of what we can do to the earth

1158
00:50:43.861 --> 00:50:46.161
and how we can effect the earth,

1159
00:50:46.163 --> 00:50:48.431
and clean up the earth with our thoughts.

1160
00:50:48.433 --> 00:50:52.335
We’re also planning on things like trying to

1161
00:50:52.336 --> 00:50:55.071
improve the grade point average of children

1162
00:50:55.073 --> 00:50:56.706
in certain poor areas of America,

1163
00:50:56.708 --> 00:50:58.241
and other parts of the world.

1164
00:50:58.243 --> 00:50:59.576
And so it goes.

1165
00:50:59.578 --> 00:51:01.711
We’ve got many plans.

1166
00:51:01.713 --> 00:51:06.148
I’d love to go back to some of those initial ideas

1167
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:09.553
of maybe helping children with attention deficit,

1168
00:51:09.555 --> 00:51:13.523
but I want to be really clear before we do that

1169
00:51:13.525 --> 00:51:16.326
that we are having positive effects.

1170
00:51:16.328 --> 00:51:18.695
Because you know, if we have 10,000 people

1171
00:51:18.696 --> 00:51:20.630
sending intention to one child,

1172
00:51:20.631 --> 00:51:22.431
we may blow this person’s head off.

1173
00:51:22.433 --> 00:51:24.333
So we don’t know yet.

1174
00:51:24.335 --> 00:51:26.936
I don’t think we will, but...

1175
00:51:26.938 --> 00:51:30.473
As Gary Schwartz says, we have to take baby steps here.

1176
00:51:30.475 --> 00:51:32.741
<v Regina>We do, and we have to start at home.</v>

1177
00:51:32.743 --> 00:51:35.345
We have to, also what about just helping ourselves?

1178
00:51:35.346 --> 00:51:37.580
<v ->Well I think this is the other thing too,</v>

1179
00:51:37.581 --> 00:51:41.485
is I really invite everyone to continue on with

1180
00:51:41.486 --> 00:51:44.286
intention experiments using these techniques,

1181
00:51:44.288 --> 00:51:47.756
trying them out at home, trying them with

1182
00:51:47.758 --> 00:51:50.960
situations that you’d like to change in your life,

1183
00:51:50.961 --> 00:51:52.361
and keeping a diary.

1184
00:51:52.363 --> 00:51:54.196
All you need is a notebook and a pen

1185
00:51:54.198 --> 00:51:59.198
and the will to change, and you too can find out

1186
00:51:59.536 --> 00:52:01.771
whether or not your thoughts can change your life.

1187
00:52:01.773 --> 00:52:04.626
(soft music)

1188
00:52:07.378 --> 00:52:09.746
<v ->To pick up a copy of ‘The Intention Experiment’</v>

just click on the link below.

1191
00:52:13.585 --> 00:52:15.251
Meanwhile you can take a look into

1192
00:52:15.253 --> 00:52:17.320
the work of some of Lynne’s associates

1193
00:52:17.321 --> 00:52:19.055
mentioned here on the site, namely

1194
00:52:19.056 --> 00:52:21.525
Gary Schwartz, Konstantin Korotkov,

1195
00:52:21.526 --> 00:52:22.825
and Russel Targ.

1196
00:52:22.826 --> 00:52:24.661
All of these scientists focus on

1197
00:52:24.663 --> 00:52:27.596
remote viewing, or the reading of subtle energies.

1198
00:52:27.598 --> 00:52:30.000
You might also want to check out Harry Oldfield.

1199
00:52:30.001 --> 00:52:32.768
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
