00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.216
(reflective music)

2
00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:17.655
<v ->In spite of the high stress and chaos factors</v>

3
00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:19.723
that are in place throughout the world right now,

4
00:00:19.723 --> 00:00:21.815
it would do us well to understand that this cycle

5
00:00:21.815 --> 00:00:25.399
is for purpose, to break old patterns in all ways.

6
00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.279
Still, many of us are feeling hopeless and not inclined to

7
00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.402
actively participate in creating our own reality.

8
00:00:31.813 --> 00:00:34.245
Thom Rogers, a medical chiropractor and founder

9
00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:36.656
of the Optimal Modification Institute,

10
00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:40.346
accesses, evaluates, and helps balance energy fields.

11
00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:43.482
This extends from human beings to corporations.

12
00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:46.170
The greatest prevailing blockage to creating our good,

13
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.621
Thom says, is that we are not remaining

14
00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:51.309
intently focused on what we wish to create.

15
00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.850
Rather, we allow the chaos and negativity

16
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.615
to distract us form our own creation.

17
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.762
<v Regina>It's so wonderful to see you again Thom.</v>

18
00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:03.725
I always feel like a brother has returned when we see you,

19
00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:05.325
even though it's been about three years.

20
00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:07.373
But, one thing that really strikes me when we're just

21
00:01:07.373 --> 00:01:10.661
having casual conversation even, is I'll bring up

22
00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:14.935
any subject and your mind seems to be able to view it

23
00:01:14.935 --> 00:01:18.967
holistically from 360 degrees, instantaneously.

24
00:01:18.967 --> 00:01:21.783
So, whatever you've done by way of the work you do,

25
00:01:21.783 --> 00:01:24.938
by way of, you know, a lifetime of meditation and such,

26
00:01:24.938 --> 00:01:27.522
your brain seems to be incredibly flexible,

27
00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:30.999
elastic if you will, in it's comprehension.

28
00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:33.794
So I just had to say that because I'm always astounded.

29
00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:35.927
It could be anything and your just brain is

30
00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:38.615
360 right around it.

31
00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:41.538
But, today we wanna talk about something that is, I think,

32
00:01:41.538 --> 00:01:45.014
really important right now and our viewers know,

33
00:01:45.014 --> 00:01:47.170
we've talked about this before, and that is

34
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.498
the whole subject of manifestation and moving beyond,

35
00:01:50.498 --> 00:01:54.230
you know, the common kind of protocols that we've all

36
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.662
heard about or become accustomed to.

37
00:01:56.662 --> 00:02:01.540
And, moving through a dynamic or a syrup, a medium of fear.

38
00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:04.086
And the fear intention seems to be mounting and first,

39
00:02:04.086 --> 00:02:07.689
I'd like you to address that directly about what you see

40
00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.377
in your work with not just individuals and healing,

41
00:02:10.377 --> 00:02:12.258
but with even companies, corporations,

42
00:02:12.258 --> 00:02:16.156
CEOs on that medium we're in right now.

43
00:02:16.393 --> 00:02:20.022
<v ->Well everybody gets affected, you know, and it's alive</v>

44
00:02:20.022 --> 00:02:22.454
right now, everyone's being affected in some way, shape,

45
00:02:22.454 --> 00:02:24.886
or form or other, just because of the media and the

46
00:02:24.886 --> 00:02:28.662
mass consciousness that's now been created from media

47
00:02:28.662 --> 00:02:32.737
and the instantaneous ability to convey information.

48
00:02:32.737 --> 00:02:34.441
People are picking up on things.

49
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:36.342
I would just reflecting on that the other day

50
00:02:36.342 --> 00:02:40.777
and it's like, in the 60's, and I don't, hate wanna really

51
00:02:40.777 --> 00:02:42.422
bring out my age here, but in the 60's

52
00:02:42.422 --> 00:02:45.110
there's a lot rebellion going on and I enjoyed

53
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.286
and was swept up into it like many hundreds

54
00:02:47.286 --> 00:02:49.929
of other thousands of people, where we were at a time

55
00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:53.961
where the university system was expanding,

56
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:58.273
the ability of the student to have freedom of choice

57
00:02:58.273 --> 00:03:00.257
and freedom of action and to a degree

58
00:03:00.257 --> 00:03:01.921
that everyone started participating.

59
00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:03.966
And, they were against the Vietnam war, it was,

60
00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:05.931
many people that are alive today remember that time.

61
00:03:05.931 --> 00:03:09.086
It was an incredible time, lots of anger,

62
00:03:09.086 --> 00:03:12.158
the political system was trying to fall apart

63
00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:16.106
and the war was just unbelievable in terms of.

64
00:03:16.106 --> 00:03:19.478
And so, so many people were not only protesting,

65
00:03:19.478 --> 00:03:22.058
but experimenting in drugs, the culture of music

66
00:03:22.058 --> 00:03:23.510
starting with the Beatles and all of it broke

67
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.006
everything down to palpable minions.

68
00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:30.422
And, people were just going through changes.

69
00:03:30.422 --> 00:03:32.893
And, I myself was just forming my life,

70
00:03:32.893 --> 00:03:35.069
going through college and getting exposed

71
00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.422
to other countries and this protest going on.

72
00:03:38.422 --> 00:03:40.086
And at one point it just seemed like

73
00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:42.749
why would you even bother to try to create a future?

74
00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:45.885
You're just caught up into the present and it's chaos.

75
00:03:45.885 --> 00:03:48.061
And, what's gonna come out of the chaos?

76
00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.966
And not having lived long enough, it was really quite

77
00:03:50.966 --> 00:03:53.162
an interesting experience for me to go through.

78
00:03:53.162 --> 00:03:57.935
And, there was fears and there was unrest and unsettlement

79
00:03:58.666 --> 00:04:02.589
and I made kind of a false conclusion myself, that why

80
00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:07.589
would you want to have this experience of not manifesting.

81
00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.789
But it seemed like I felt like, why bother, what's the use?

82
00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:14.857
<v Regina>Because of the uncertainty on all fronts.</v>

83
00:04:14.857 --> 00:04:16.137
<v ->Exactly.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

84
00:04:16.137 --> 00:04:18.421
<v ->And, as a young man I was like, I don't even know</v>

85
00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:20.662
what I'm doing in my life, should I do anything?

86
00:04:20.662 --> 00:04:22.326
<v Regina>Well, this is sounding awfully familiar.</v>

87
00:04:22.326 --> 00:04:26.185
I have a 29 year old son, it's sounding very familiar

88
00:04:26.185 --> 00:04:28.961
to what they're going through now it's springtime,

89
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:31.433
occupy movement is just starting to show it's head

90
00:04:31.433 --> 00:04:33.161
and mount in energy again.

91
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:34.677
<v ->I know.
<v Regina>Jessica Murray,</v>

92
00:04:34.677 --> 00:04:36.981
who we've also interviewed who's really a lovely,

93
00:04:36.981 --> 00:04:40.097
kind of deep astrologer, she said that those conditions

94
00:04:40.097 --> 00:04:43.425
that existed int he 60's astrologically have come

95
00:04:43.425 --> 00:04:45.665
full circle and we're experiencing

96
00:04:45.665 --> 00:04:48.033
the same kind of cosmic influence now.

97
00:04:48.033 --> 00:04:50.037
<v ->Very definitely and even more so,</v>

98
00:04:50.037 --> 00:04:52.341
because of the confluence of cycles and

99
00:04:52.341 --> 00:04:54.536
I was just thinking, I mean, look at all the things

100
00:04:54.536 --> 00:04:57.397
that we are contending with, apart from

101
00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:59.893
whatever it is we're set out to do in life.

102
00:04:59.893 --> 00:05:03.925
We have CO2 scares, we have caps supposedly melting,

103
00:05:03.925 --> 00:05:07.272
we the magnetic forces of the earth supposedly decreasing.

104
00:05:07.272 --> 00:05:09.729
We have tsunami waves that we've seen in our lifetime.

105
00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.624
We have meltdowns on atomic levels

106
00:05:11.624 --> 00:05:13.504
that we've seen in our lifetime.

107
00:05:13.504 --> 00:05:16.360
Food problems with being tainted with poisons

108
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.093
and trying to go through chem trails and the heart projects

109
00:05:19.093 --> 00:05:21.423
that are all over, there's several of them now on the earth.

110
00:05:21.423 --> 00:05:22.995
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->Have the ability and do</v>

111
00:05:22.995 --> 00:05:26.471
and can effect weather and climatic conditions.

112
00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:29.159
We have earthquakes going on at high levels

113
00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:32.339
that before had not been seen or recorded.

114
00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:35.687
And, it just goes on, I could go through a whole list

115
00:05:35.687 --> 00:05:39.123
of concerns right now that are affecting people's lives.

116
00:05:39.123 --> 00:05:42.451
And, psychic waves that go through and the breakdowns

117
00:05:42.451 --> 00:05:45.331
of our political systems in a sense are trying to happen

118
00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:48.019
and many countries kind of coming apart by the seams.

119
00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:49.299
<v Regina>Because of the breakdown in the economies</v>

120
00:05:49.299 --> 00:05:50.323
of the world.
<v Thom>Exactly.</v>

121
00:05:50.323 --> 00:05:52.872
And the, what's going on in the Arab countries,

122
00:05:52.872 --> 00:05:54.781
just there's so much influence and so much

123
00:05:54.781 --> 00:05:57.261
vast changes that are going on right now.

124
00:05:57.261 --> 00:06:00.501
The monetary system is under tremendous stress

125
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:03.746
and people's families, they do not know really what to do.

126
00:06:03.746 --> 00:06:07.394
<v Regina>Yeah, even if you're not dialed into that,</v>

127
00:06:07.394 --> 00:06:09.634
even if you've kept your life very simple

128
00:06:09.634 --> 00:06:12.917
and you only put yourself around positive influences.

129
00:06:12.917 --> 00:06:14.325
Oops, almost dropped my book.

130
00:06:14.325 --> 00:06:18.273
Around positive influences and the like, the reality is that

131
00:06:18.273 --> 00:06:22.113
is in the field and we're all being bathed in that soup.

132
00:06:22.113 --> 00:06:25.228
<v ->Right, so again it comes back to the question, do I</v>

133
00:06:25.228 --> 00:06:29.388
manifest and do I continue to engage in my own creation?

134
00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:32.524
And, the truth of it is is that, you know, in our self,

135
00:06:32.524 --> 00:06:36.175
there's really no, it's a big illusion that we have

136
00:06:36.175 --> 00:06:38.372
and deception that we have that there's

137
00:06:38.372 --> 00:06:40.036
other states of consciousness that work

138
00:06:40.036 --> 00:06:41.743
in our life other than our own.

139
00:06:41.743 --> 00:06:44.899
We, our own states, are what determine and make our life.

140
00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:48.419
And so, all of this is the serving ground for us

141
00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:51.279
to come back and reclaim our own inner being.

142
00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:53.455
And really get in touch with the mastery

143
00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.799
of that part of our self, which is our self.

144
00:06:55.799 --> 00:06:57.783
<v Regina>Right, because there's a fear that goes along</v>

145
00:06:57.783 --> 00:07:01.347
with this that geez with all this going on how could I,

146
00:07:01.347 --> 00:07:04.396
even ifI wanted to choose a goal and a manifestation,

147
00:07:04.396 --> 00:07:08.024
how can I admit to this and people become very defeated.

148
00:07:08.024 --> 00:07:10.543
<v ->Yeah there is a lot of that going on.</v>

149
00:07:10.543 --> 00:07:12.694
There's no reason really to in the long run.

150
00:07:12.694 --> 00:07:14.754
Cause it's just, this is all illusion.

151
00:07:14.754 --> 00:07:16.162
<v Regina>That's right.</v>

152
00:07:16.162 --> 00:07:19.895
<v ->It's all illusion and we need to find our self</v>

153
00:07:19.895 --> 00:07:21.730
and become cause again in our life

154
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.014
and create the manifestations that are worthwhile to serve

155
00:07:25.014 --> 00:07:27.554
the whole, look how the whole's serving us in other ways.

156
00:07:27.554 --> 00:07:30.626
It gives us sunshine, photosynthesis.

157
00:07:30.626 --> 00:07:32.054
It gives us a temperature zone

158
00:07:32.054 --> 00:07:33.782
that we as humans can live in.

159
00:07:33.782 --> 00:07:36.047
We have water, we have so many things

160
00:07:36.047 --> 00:07:38.070
that have been given to us by the gift of the creator,

161
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.822
including our own being, which is a fragment

162
00:07:40.822 --> 00:07:41.755
of that creation.

163
00:07:41.755 --> 00:07:42.843
<v Regina>Right.</v>

164
00:07:42.843 --> 00:07:44.487
<v ->That's linked to that creation.</v>

165
00:07:44.487 --> 00:07:47.303
So, we have all this and we need, and are,

166
00:07:47.303 --> 00:07:49.735
and in the process to giving that back and that's really

167
00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:52.211
what life is becoming about, it's about

168
00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:54.535
giving back to life what it's given to you.

169
00:07:54.535 --> 00:07:57.690
And once you get into that service mode, everything changes.

170
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.103
Your whole life will shift, you know.

171
00:08:00.103 --> 00:08:01.786
If you're not into service, you're missing the boat

172
00:08:01.786 --> 00:08:04.538
right now, because service to other human life

173
00:08:04.538 --> 00:08:07.827
and other types of animal life and plant life,

174
00:08:07.827 --> 00:08:10.771
service to the earth, service to your family,

175
00:08:10.771 --> 00:08:12.839
this is where it's at and we're being brought together

176
00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:14.354
whether we know it or not.

177
00:08:14.354 --> 00:08:16.850
More and more intentionally to have to do that,

178
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.746
because that's the way it's gonna be.

179
00:08:18.746 --> 00:08:19.849
You know, people are moving home.

180
00:08:19.849 --> 00:08:21.385
<v Regina>Yeah, exactly, kids moving home,</v>

181
00:08:21.385 --> 00:08:23.049
parents moving with kids.

182
00:08:23.049 --> 00:08:25.470
Yeah, exactly and the thing is, what you

183
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.758
touched on a moment ago, this being our own creation.

184
00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:31.254
It really doesn't matter (clears throat)

185
00:08:31.254 --> 00:08:35.753
what the prevailing energy is around us and I think,

186
00:08:35.753 --> 00:08:37.993
that's why I wanted to talk to you.

187
00:08:37.993 --> 00:08:40.041
It's really important for people to understand it.

188
00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:43.222
I personally feel fabulous in my own creation, my own life

189
00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:46.505
feels absolutely fabulous amidst all this.

190
00:08:46.505 --> 00:08:50.621
And, I know people and it's very specifically,

191
00:08:50.621 --> 00:08:55.125
the people who have a clear will and a clear focus

192
00:08:55.125 --> 00:09:00.117
of what they truly intend to do, open-hearted focus,

193
00:09:00.117 --> 00:09:03.593
are not necessarily suffering in the same way many others

194
00:09:03.593 --> 00:09:05.085
are suffering.
<v Thom>Right.</v>

195
00:09:05.085 --> 00:09:08.349
<v Regina>So, we need to go into the ramifications of what</v>

196
00:09:08.349 --> 00:09:13.349
I've just said there, manifestation using imagination.

197
00:09:13.557 --> 00:09:15.496
Which is for me, that's how I create everything

198
00:09:15.496 --> 00:09:17.653
is daydreaming and imagining the reality.

199
00:09:17.653 --> 00:09:20.277
<v ->Imagining is making an image real.</v>

200
00:09:20.277 --> 00:09:22.600
<v Regina>Uh-huh.</v>
<v ->And, you're imagining</v>

201
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.647
the image is what you're doing.

202
00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.887
And, we are free to choose our states and a lot of people

203
00:09:26.887 --> 00:09:28.832
choose states and they're really sorry they did.

204
00:09:28.832 --> 00:09:30.432
They don't know how to get out of them (laughs).

205
00:09:30.432 --> 00:09:32.096
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v ->And, it's our choice.</v>

206
00:09:32.096 --> 00:09:34.976
But, that's our choice and we can change

207
00:09:34.976 --> 00:09:37.407
our destinies by the choices that we make.

208
00:09:37.407 --> 00:09:39.839
<v Regina>Absolutely, what is it about,</v>

209
00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:42.695
and I want you to really go into this whole notion

210
00:09:42.695 --> 00:09:46.151
of imagination and the blockages.

211
00:09:46.151 --> 00:09:48.327
You see every kind of blockage, whether it's

212
00:09:48.327 --> 00:09:51.571
at a corporate level, or a personal, or a health level.

213
00:09:51.571 --> 00:09:54.343
What is it within human beings that's going on

214
00:09:54.343 --> 00:09:58.783
that we will not allow ourselves the fantasy.

215
00:09:58.783 --> 00:10:03.111
People think of it as fantasy time to imagine

216
00:10:03.111 --> 00:10:06.034
and use our imagination and really truly employ it

217
00:10:06.034 --> 00:10:08.402
And, maybe give us some good examples too.

218
00:10:08.402 --> 00:10:11.775
<v ->Oh there's, I have, if we had five hours.</v>

219
00:10:11.775 --> 00:10:14.411
<v Regina>Well, we can go through a couple anyway, but just</v>

220
00:10:14.411 --> 00:10:17.739
in theory and then a couple of situations you know about.

221
00:10:17.739 --> 00:10:21.239
<v ->Well, let me just give you a, kind of a, I was watching</v>

222
00:10:21.239 --> 00:10:23.095
Forrest Gump the other night.
<v Regina>Oh yeah.</v>

223
00:10:23.095 --> 00:10:24.503
I love that.
<v Thom>It's probably about</v>

224
00:10:24.503 --> 00:10:25.603
fifth time I've watched it.
<v Regina>Love that film.</v>

225
00:10:25.603 --> 00:10:26.736
<v ->What I like about that is (clears throat),</v>

226
00:10:26.736 --> 00:10:29.101
as soon as he gets a notion, he just zeros in

227
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:31.493
and then, he's gone and he's into that notion.

228
00:10:31.493 --> 00:10:32.728
He doesn't even bother to pack,

229
00:10:32.728 --> 00:10:34.712
he's just into the next thing.

230
00:10:34.712 --> 00:10:38.597
And, in a way he's willing to take, not even the risk,

231
00:10:38.597 --> 00:10:40.216
he's just willing to go for it.

232
00:10:40.216 --> 00:10:42.540
But, what I really liked in that movie the other day,

233
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.888
that really brings out the imaginative faculty

234
00:10:44.888 --> 00:10:49.304
and how truthful it works, is he was on the,

235
00:10:49.304 --> 00:10:50.812
there was a scene where he was on the balcony

236
00:10:50.812 --> 00:10:54.378
of his mother's house, mother had already died,

237
00:10:54.378 --> 00:10:58.577
and he was picturing Jenny, his childhood girlfriend,

238
00:10:58.577 --> 00:11:00.789
coming back and he pictured her every night

239
00:11:00.789 --> 00:11:03.905
and every night he could see, literally, her walking

240
00:11:03.905 --> 00:11:06.145
into the front yard of the house

241
00:11:06.145 --> 00:11:08.129
and then she would disappear in a vapor.

242
00:11:08.129 --> 00:11:09.557
<v Regina>And he would talk to her.</v>

243
00:11:09.557 --> 00:11:11.861
<v ->He would talk to her, he made it so real,</v>

244
00:11:11.861 --> 00:11:15.716
his feeling of the wish fulfilled became so real,

245
00:11:15.716 --> 00:11:19.448
that one day somehow, some way, she came out of her

246
00:11:19.448 --> 00:11:23.863
whole past and came back and was walking into that yard

247
00:11:23.863 --> 00:11:26.487
and his heart just opened and he had the greatest time

248
00:11:26.487 --> 00:11:29.840
in his life until she left and she left the night before

249
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.015
and gave him, unknown to him, a baby

250
00:11:33.015 --> 00:11:35.088
that was conceived.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

251
00:11:35.088 --> 00:11:39.312
<v ->And so, the imagery of his using his imagination</v>

252
00:11:39.312 --> 00:11:43.383
to go so far as to attract, bring forth life before the

253
00:11:43.383 --> 00:11:47.247
mother died, to have this child then come into his life,

254
00:11:47.247 --> 00:11:49.316
was all through the power of his imagination.

255
00:11:49.316 --> 00:11:50.639
It was like perfect.

256
00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:51.940
<v Regina>It was so beautiful.</v>

257
00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.775
<v ->It was perfect and that's really the way it works for us</v>

258
00:11:54.775 --> 00:11:59.108
after certain things are cleared or we stay with

259
00:11:59.108 --> 00:12:01.658
the image long enough, feel it long enough,

260
00:12:01.658 --> 00:12:03.706
keep our focus concentration long enough on it,

261
00:12:03.706 --> 00:12:06.714
and repetitively do it, childlike manner, any way

262
00:12:06.714 --> 00:12:09.018
during contemplations, during any time, but

263
00:12:09.018 --> 00:12:11.617
keeping our imaginations active and alive.

264
00:12:11.617 --> 00:12:13.390
<v Regina>Let's talk about how you break the,</v>

265
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.905
what we normally go through.

266
00:12:14.905 --> 00:12:19.065
Most people go through habitual loops of negative imagery,

267
00:12:19.065 --> 00:12:22.881
self-talk and self-worth, negative imagery in their mind,

268
00:12:22.881 --> 00:12:25.889
negative memories, negative reinforcement, which of course

269
00:12:25.889 --> 00:12:27.406
just brings on more of the same.

270
00:12:27.406 --> 00:12:29.665
Wherever your mind goes your life goes.

271
00:12:29.665 --> 00:12:32.909
How does one begin shifting and give us maybe an example

272
00:12:32.909 --> 00:12:34.233
of someone you've worked with.

273
00:12:34.233 --> 00:12:38.861
<v ->More people, more people, there's, yeah.</v>

274
00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:42.765
More people have

275
00:12:42.765 --> 00:12:44.729
lost touch with what they're saying

276
00:12:44.729 --> 00:12:46.669
inside themself.
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

277
00:12:46.669 --> 00:12:50.937
<v ->And, to hear, you need to become a little conscious</v>

278
00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:53.625
to just start listening to what you're saying inside.

279
00:12:53.625 --> 00:12:57.145
And, there's so many ways to get in touch with that

280
00:12:57.145 --> 00:13:00.685
and to take it further and to, starting to let go

281
00:13:00.685 --> 00:13:03.545
of some of the mental aberrations.

282
00:13:03.545 --> 00:13:05.760
'Cause once you give a spoken word to something that goes

283
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.197
out into the universe, whether you want it to or not.

284
00:13:09.197 --> 00:13:12.141
And, if you don't call it back in a certain period of time

285
00:13:12.141 --> 00:13:15.193
it seems, it goes out and starts, sits on manifestation

286
00:13:15.193 --> 00:13:18.221
as a thought form, so all these negative thoughts,

287
00:13:18.221 --> 00:13:21.144
even though we don't see the cause and effect right away,

288
00:13:21.144 --> 00:13:23.405
Just like sometimes when you want something positive

289
00:13:23.405 --> 00:13:25.664
in your life, you don't see it right away.

290
00:13:25.664 --> 00:13:28.504
There's a time element for everything to maturate.

291
00:13:28.504 --> 00:13:31.597
<v Regina>Is it, do, I mean have you ever been able to</v>

292
00:13:31.597 --> 00:13:36.504
evaluate or calibrate that phenomena?

293
00:13:36.504 --> 00:13:39.040
Does it happen, is it different in every situation

294
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.792
with every person or is there an actual

295
00:13:40.792 --> 00:13:42.624
kind of calibration to that?

296
00:13:42.624 --> 00:13:46.124
<v ->Well, sure you can calibrate the resistances, the burdens.</v>

297
00:13:46.124 --> 00:13:50.584
You can calibrate the degree of (clears throat)

298
00:13:50.584 --> 00:13:53.656
percent of lack of realization toward if it is a goal

299
00:13:53.656 --> 00:13:56.812
or a positive thing you're trying to bring into your life.

300
00:13:56.812 --> 00:14:00.351
You can collapse time and you can also clear

301
00:14:00.351 --> 00:14:03.064
some of the aberrations that have lead up to that

302
00:14:03.064 --> 00:14:05.688
just through the work that we do.

303
00:14:05.688 --> 00:14:08.652
And that does help to facilitate the manifestation, in a

304
00:14:08.652 --> 00:14:12.172
quicker time period often and certainly in the health state.

305
00:14:12.172 --> 00:14:14.648
I mean, a person can regain their health much more quickly,

306
00:14:14.648 --> 00:14:16.671
'cause this is a big, big component.

307
00:14:16.671 --> 00:14:17.631
<v Regina>So, you're kind of reversing</v>

308
00:14:17.631 --> 00:14:19.378
those negative patterns that have been set out there.

309
00:14:19.378 --> 00:14:22.066
You're balancing, or correcting, or negating them

310
00:14:22.066 --> 00:14:24.607
with that kind of energetic work that you and others

311
00:14:24.607 --> 00:14:26.482
in various other modalities are doing when you're

312
00:14:26.482 --> 00:14:29.002
intercepting the actual thought forms

313
00:14:29.002 --> 00:14:31.327
and starting to correct from there.

314
00:14:31.327 --> 00:14:33.778
But, meanwhile most people don't have the advantage of that.

315
00:14:33.778 --> 00:14:36.170
They're just putting them out there, every negative thing

316
00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.647
that's ever happened, same story, same thought, same words

317
00:14:39.647 --> 00:14:42.866
day after day in one's mind, it's a horrible prison.

318
00:14:42.866 --> 00:14:44.831
<v ->You know, by the time you're 35,</v>

319
00:14:44.831 --> 00:14:46.410
there's been studies now that show that

320
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.630
your thought patterns are pretty much in habitual form.

321
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.978
Your structure of your life has been set up.

322
00:14:51.978 --> 00:14:54.666
Your cell level and memory levels are set up.

323
00:14:54.666 --> 00:14:56.906
And, you're pretty much (clears throat) gonna go down

324
00:14:56.906 --> 00:15:00.446
a certain road and you're gonna have a recycled version

325
00:15:00.446 --> 00:15:02.130
of the past basically.

326
00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.390
<v Regina>Oh that's depressing.</v>

327
00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.822
<v ->Or, what do they call it, a default, you know.</v>

328
00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:07.570
<v Regina>But, it is depressing but you know what?</v>

329
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.538
You can see it, there is something that happens

330
00:15:10.538 --> 00:15:12.241
and sets in with different kind.

331
00:15:12.241 --> 00:15:15.914
Individuals who have these elastic, open minds

332
00:15:15.914 --> 00:15:19.582
and open hearts do not even age the same way.

333
00:15:19.582 --> 00:15:21.034
<v ->True.
<v Regina>And so,</v>

334
00:15:21.034 --> 00:15:22.846
this is part of what you're talking about.

335
00:15:22.846 --> 00:15:24.362
<v ->So, here's some things that are just practical</v>

336
00:15:24.362 --> 00:15:27.390
that I've found over the years, if you're saying a thought,

337
00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.930
take that and wad it up in your mind's eye

338
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.598
and throw it in a waste basket or burn it or, put it into

339
00:15:33.598 --> 00:15:37.201
an imagined, what do they call those little shredders.

340
00:15:37.201 --> 00:15:38.825
<v Regina>Yes, a paper shredder.</v>

341
00:15:38.825 --> 00:15:40.785
<v ->Or, just say cancel clear and that'll</v>

342
00:15:40.785 --> 00:15:43.153
help to release the thought form.

343
00:15:43.153 --> 00:15:44.165
<v Regina>But, you have to first.</v>

344
00:15:44.165 --> 00:15:45.353
<v ->As it comes up in the moment, but you be aware of it.</v>

345
00:15:45.353 --> 00:15:46.851
<v Regina>You have to catch it, yeah.</v>

346
00:15:46.851 --> 00:15:50.200
<v ->But, it's a process of awakening and everyone can do this</v>

347
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.399
if they want to and they want to improve their life.

348
00:15:53.399 --> 00:15:54.915
<v Regina>So, before we even go into</v>

349
00:15:54.915 --> 00:15:58.435
the beautiful imaginings, or simultaneously let's say,

350
00:15:58.435 --> 00:16:00.247
we have to give ourselves permission.

351
00:16:00.247 --> 00:16:03.127
We have to, what I'm hearing you say is, be aware enough

352
00:16:03.127 --> 00:16:06.455
to catch, oh there's that same worn out old thought that

353
00:16:06.455 --> 00:16:08.887
bores me stiff and has no purpose,

354
00:16:08.887 --> 00:16:10.891
it's not leading anywhere, you have to recognize it.

355
00:16:10.891 --> 00:16:13.579
So, is that a matter of putting your intention out

356
00:16:13.579 --> 00:16:15.991
to your own being, your own consciousness?

357
00:16:15.991 --> 00:16:20.440
Make me aware when these habituated thoughts start again.

358
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.509
<v ->Yes, absolutely.
<v Regina>Which will be</v>

359
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:23.064
in one minute or less.
<v Thom>Absolutely.</v>

360
00:16:23.064 --> 00:16:25.136
I mean, and it's an active state

361
00:16:25.136 --> 00:16:26.904
that you have to participate in.

362
00:16:26.904 --> 00:16:30.404
We do find a lot of shifts in people's attitudes

363
00:16:30.404 --> 00:16:32.088
and viewpoints which reflect some of

364
00:16:32.088 --> 00:16:34.840
that energy when we work with them.

365
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.784
And, in corporations there's just a tremendous amount

366
00:16:37.784 --> 00:16:40.304
of this that goes on because they employ

367
00:16:40.304 --> 00:16:41.796
so many people and there are so many

368
00:16:41.796 --> 00:16:43.608
different people involved in the process.

369
00:16:43.608 --> 00:16:46.640
So, we're constantly helping the process

370
00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.412
by helping to unload I guess you might say, a lot of

371
00:16:49.412 --> 00:16:53.380
these types of interferences and give rise to the envision

372
00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.493
of a goal, or the manifestation of a mission in a company.

373
00:16:56.493 --> 00:16:59.397
<v Regina>Yeah and so, on an individual level,</v>

374
00:16:59.397 --> 00:17:03.749
as you work with both, we have to and let's say,

375
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:06.437
the person is, whoever is watching this right now

376
00:17:06.437 --> 00:17:08.141
and wants to start utilizing this,

377
00:17:08.141 --> 00:17:09.785
to really start re-patterning the way

378
00:17:09.785 --> 00:17:13.241
they're expressing their will in the world.

379
00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:16.313
So, we start by stopping the negative self-talk

380
00:17:16.313 --> 00:17:18.617
as best we can and you say cancel clear,

381
00:17:18.617 --> 00:17:21.708
get rid of that thought, wad it up, throw it away, whatever.

382
00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:26.708
And then, at the same time we can, we need to be convinced

383
00:17:27.045 --> 00:17:31.244
that it's not a waste of our time to daydream

384
00:17:31.244 --> 00:17:34.596
and begin imagining a finished outcome.

385
00:17:34.596 --> 00:17:36.556
And, can you talk about that process?

386
00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:40.076
<v ->Well, first it's good to be able to control your attention</v>

387
00:17:40.076 --> 00:17:42.041
and most people will find that their attention

388
00:17:42.041 --> 00:17:44.537
is just like the TV, it's just every three seconds

389
00:17:44.537 --> 00:17:47.033
it's on something else and a controlled attention

390
00:17:47.033 --> 00:17:48.716
is really, really important.

391
00:17:48.716 --> 00:17:51.364
I mean, if you don't, and it's a practice and you know,

392
00:17:51.364 --> 00:17:53.796
it's a practice toward mastery.

393
00:17:53.796 --> 00:17:56.804
And, once you'll be able to control your attention,

394
00:17:56.804 --> 00:17:59.320
you also have to be able to enter into the feeling

395
00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.180
of a wish fulfilled, or feeling of the instate,

396
00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.592
what we call the transformed two state

397
00:18:05.592 --> 00:18:10.180
where you're actually in the space long before

398
00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.460
maybe it's happening physically,

399
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.252
but you're experiencing every little aspect of that.

400
00:18:14.252 --> 00:18:18.840
There was a boy that, it was a young boy,

401
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.267
and he wanted a dog so much.

402
00:18:20.267 --> 00:18:21.380
He was living with his grandmother

403
00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.428
'cause his parents, I think were gone

404
00:18:23.428 --> 00:18:25.156
and so his grandmother was bringing him up.

405
00:18:25.156 --> 00:18:29.227
He wanted the dog so bad, at any cost,

406
00:18:29.227 --> 00:18:32.216
and grandmother said no, she just could not go there.

407
00:18:32.216 --> 00:18:34.372
It was all she could do to raise the boy.

408
00:18:34.372 --> 00:18:38.296
And, I think she had a fear of dogs and so on.

409
00:18:38.296 --> 00:18:40.747
So, I mean it wasn't even in the question

410
00:18:40.747 --> 00:18:43.883
and this little boy didn't hear the grandmother.

411
00:18:43.883 --> 00:18:46.147
He just wanted the dog and he kept wanting it

412
00:18:46.147 --> 00:18:48.443
and wanting it and he kept picturing it.

413
00:18:48.443 --> 00:18:51.707
And, one day he entered a contest of writing.

414
00:18:51.707 --> 00:18:53.986
It was a school contest and it was like,

415
00:18:53.986 --> 00:18:55.778
why do you want a dog or something like,

416
00:18:55.778 --> 00:18:59.194
or what do you love about dogs or something.

417
00:18:59.194 --> 00:19:02.351
He wrote among hundreds of other participants

418
00:19:02.351 --> 00:19:05.186
and they picked him as the winner.

419
00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:07.279
And so, they spotlighted him in the community

420
00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:09.647
and on a community level, you know,

421
00:19:09.647 --> 00:19:11.567
on the newspaper and about how he won

422
00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:15.874
and his essay and they awarded him a prize

423
00:19:15.874 --> 00:19:19.287
and the prize was a dog.

424
00:19:19.287 --> 00:19:22.191
<v Regina>How'd grandma go down with this thing?</v>

425
00:19:22.191 --> 00:19:24.151
<v ->And, grandma of course was swept up</v>

426
00:19:24.151 --> 00:19:26.607
into all the other beings around that were just

427
00:19:26.607 --> 00:19:29.124
so wanting this boy to have this dog.

428
00:19:29.124 --> 00:19:31.983
And, she was still like no, no, no, no,

429
00:19:31.983 --> 00:19:34.244
but she was starting to break down,

430
00:19:34.244 --> 00:19:35.908
not because of what he could do, but because

431
00:19:35.908 --> 00:19:38.724
of what he had done in his imagination that created this.

432
00:19:38.724 --> 00:19:41.815
And finally, you know, because of all the photographers

433
00:19:41.815 --> 00:19:44.207
that came and the press releases and you know,

434
00:19:44.207 --> 00:19:47.063
things that were put in the paper, she gave in

435
00:19:47.063 --> 00:19:49.367
and finally said okay.

436
00:19:49.367 --> 00:19:51.715
And, he went to get his dog and it was the dog

437
00:19:51.715 --> 00:19:53.487
that he pictured, it was a collie.

438
00:19:53.487 --> 00:19:54.575
<v Regina>Oh, is that right?</v>

439
00:19:54.575 --> 00:19:56.239
<v ->And that was the dog that he wanted to give him.</v>

440
00:19:56.239 --> 00:19:58.307
That was how the universe was conspiring

441
00:19:58.307 --> 00:19:59.779
to help him.
<v Regina>So specifically.</v>

442
00:19:59.779 --> 00:20:02.383
<v ->And, I just, people need to know there are</v>

443
00:20:02.383 --> 00:20:04.111
thousands of stories like this.

444
00:20:04.111 --> 00:20:06.134
I could go through and spend hours telling you

445
00:20:06.134 --> 00:20:10.147
story after story after story, watching how the imagination

446
00:20:10.147 --> 00:20:12.854
was able to bring forth a result that was beyond

447
00:20:12.854 --> 00:20:14.563
the current circumstances of your life.

448
00:20:14.563 --> 00:20:16.527
<v Regina>And, very literally even.</v>

449
00:20:17.736 --> 00:20:20.936
And what's, you know, as I'm listening to you, one thing

450
00:20:20.936 --> 00:20:24.221
that's popping into my mind is that's a child, that's a boy.

451
00:20:24.221 --> 00:20:25.716
Right.
<v Thom>Uh-huh.</v>

452
00:20:25.716 --> 00:20:28.360
<v Regina>And children have this incredible ability</v>

453
00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.620
because they haven't been programmed to the same extent.

454
00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.880
<v Thom>True.</v>
<v Regina>They don't have</v>

455
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.564
the same kind of considerations.

456
00:20:33.564 --> 00:20:35.144
Oh, I'm gonna have to buy the dog food

457
00:20:35.144 --> 00:20:36.552
and I'm gonna have to sweep the hair up

458
00:20:36.552 --> 00:20:38.516
in the corners of the room and so forth.

459
00:20:38.516 --> 00:20:41.558
They just want.
<v Thom>Yeah.</v>

460
00:20:41.588 --> 00:20:44.060
<v Regina>We let those other filters come in.</v>

461
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:48.840
How do we clarify that pure desire, as adults,

462
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.568
that are always allowing their mind

463
00:20:50.568 --> 00:20:53.000
to take other things into consideration?

464
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.115
<v ->Well, a good thing is, one thing is saying to yourself,</v>

465
00:20:56.115 --> 00:20:57.864
all thoughts, words, and actions are done

466
00:20:57.864 --> 00:21:00.467
in the name of the highest and declaring that every day

467
00:21:00.467 --> 00:21:03.260
and maybe multiple times throughout the day if necessary.

468
00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:07.882
That helps and I've also found, for me,

469
00:21:07.882 --> 00:21:09.362
(clears throat) excuse me,

470
00:21:09.362 --> 00:21:12.962
I have found for me that singing the song of Hu, H-U,

471
00:21:12.962 --> 00:21:17.299
has also been an uplifting state to get me above my mind.

472
00:21:17.299 --> 00:21:21.286
And, once I feel like I'm in my self as soul.

473
00:21:21.286 --> 00:21:22.866
Which is who are.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

474
00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:26.302
<v ->You can then have a better space of being able to</v>

475
00:21:26.302 --> 00:21:29.266
look at your mind and from a distance and you

476
00:21:29.266 --> 00:21:32.422
are able to make more changes rather than be stuck in a

477
00:21:32.422 --> 00:21:35.026
pattern, see patterns will actually work themselves out.

478
00:21:35.026 --> 00:21:37.010
<v Regina>What is the song of hu?</v>

479
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:40.678
<v ->H-U, it's a song that you can sing</v>

480
00:21:40.678 --> 00:21:42.366
to yourself with great love.

481
00:21:42.366 --> 00:21:44.862
If you look at the word human it's the first two letters

482
00:21:44.862 --> 00:21:47.205
of our word, of who we are, human.

483
00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:48.613
And that's where it came from.

484
00:21:48.613 --> 00:21:51.262
<v Regina>Does it have a particular tonality to it?</v>

485
00:21:51.262 --> 00:21:54.718
<v ->It's a universal, yeah you can actually sing it</v>

486
00:21:54.718 --> 00:21:57.790
in any song, in any note, any note that you want.

487
00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.840
And it's sung like a chant, like

488
00:22:00.014 --> 00:22:04.370
♫ hu ♫

489
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:06.205
And then, again and again and again.

490
00:22:06.205 --> 00:22:07.677
<v Regina>Okay, good thank you for sharing that</v>

491
00:22:07.677 --> 00:22:09.680
because that's something we can all access.

492
00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.536
<v ->Yeah it is and it's a frequency.</v>

493
00:22:11.536 --> 00:22:13.821
It's a wonderful frequency, it brings great love,

494
00:22:13.821 --> 00:22:17.970
it can bring peace and healings and it helps re-right

495
00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.402
situations that may not be right when you need the help.

496
00:22:20.402 --> 00:22:21.727
<v Regina>So, it must be a very high frequency</v>

497
00:22:21.727 --> 00:22:22.923
that's balancing it out.
<v Thom>Very high frequency.</v>

498
00:22:22.923 --> 00:22:26.527
Allows soul to basically get free from the mind

499
00:22:26.527 --> 00:22:29.810
and being able to, you know, start to create it's own

500
00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.562
essence and it's own pain.

501
00:22:31.562 --> 00:22:33.823
<v Regina>Okay now, you've talked about the little boy,</v>

502
00:22:33.823 --> 00:22:36.106
we talked about innocence, and clearing it with hu

503
00:22:36.106 --> 00:22:37.618
if you have too active a mind.

504
00:22:37.618 --> 00:22:39.711
But now we're looking at say larger things,

505
00:22:39.711 --> 00:22:42.122
say you own a business or you have a family

506
00:22:42.122 --> 00:22:44.703
that is in a state of dysfunction and you're looking

507
00:22:44.703 --> 00:22:48.522
at group kind of will and working together,

508
00:22:48.522 --> 00:22:51.352
which you do all the time with very large corportation

509
00:22:51.352 --> 00:22:55.029
to bring them into harmony for optimization of results.

510
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:59.637
And, how does that work with the will, intention and vision?

511
00:22:59.637 --> 00:23:01.216
<v ->Well, I'll give you an example.</v>

512
00:23:01.216 --> 00:23:03.988
There was a company in Colorado and they were

513
00:23:03.988 --> 00:23:08.040
in real estate, a big, big, big, huge potential contract

514
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.536
was coming up in front of their eyes.

515
00:23:10.536 --> 00:23:12.672
It involved large parcels of land being able

516
00:23:12.672 --> 00:23:14.656
to be sold and bought from different people

517
00:23:14.656 --> 00:23:17.256
and sold to another person and major conflicts

518
00:23:17.256 --> 00:23:19.496
of the land owners around the area, because they didn't

519
00:23:19.496 --> 00:23:22.016
want certain changes that could happen to happen

520
00:23:22.016 --> 00:23:24.103
and they were not willing to let go of their pieces

521
00:23:24.103 --> 00:23:26.004
unless certain things were stipulated.

522
00:23:26.004 --> 00:23:28.647
And, the buyer was not open to that

523
00:23:28.647 --> 00:23:33.127
and it was like these two huge beings trying to, you know,

524
00:23:33.127 --> 00:23:37.287
come to terms and it was like, maybe 2% possibility

525
00:23:37.287 --> 00:23:40.340
or 1% possibility it was actually going to come to fruition.

526
00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.511
<v Regina>Too much disharmony.</v>

527
00:23:41.511 --> 00:23:43.775
<v ->Right and they contacted me during that time</v>

528
00:23:43.775 --> 00:23:47.207
(clears throat) and we started working with the whole entity

529
00:23:47.207 --> 00:23:51.028
of all these components and low and behold.

530
00:23:51.028 --> 00:23:52.756
<v Regina>Did you work with both sides?</v>

531
00:23:52.756 --> 00:23:54.183
<v ->(clears throat) No, we didn't have permission</v>

532
00:23:54.183 --> 00:23:56.871
to work with the, we only had permission to work with

533
00:23:56.871 --> 00:23:58.791
the realtor who was representing the buyer.

534
00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:00.415
<v Regina>Okay.</v>
<v ->And also,</v>

535
00:24:00.415 --> 00:24:03.295
He may have been representing the seller,

536
00:24:03.295 --> 00:24:05.939
but we could only work within the confines of him.

537
00:24:05.939 --> 00:24:07.239
<v Regina>Okay.</v>
<v ->'Cause we didn't have</v>

538
00:24:07.239 --> 00:24:09.247
permission from the other individuals,

539
00:24:09.247 --> 00:24:11.251
so we just worked with all the other things

540
00:24:11.251 --> 00:24:13.279
as a, what we call a constituent subset.

541
00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:15.815
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>
<v ->And, we were able to</v>

542
00:24:15.815 --> 00:24:19.123
release all the different blockages

543
00:24:19.123 --> 00:24:23.347
that came up around the sale and get into

544
00:24:23.347 --> 00:24:25.951
just the most optimum state of alignment.

545
00:24:25.951 --> 00:24:28.211
And, even though these people didn't think

546
00:24:28.211 --> 00:24:30.790
there was much of a chance, they were hoping down deep

547
00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:34.310
that there was a chance, but it was so slim.

548
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.702
And yeah, because of the work that we did,

549
00:24:37.702 --> 00:24:40.435
and we did intensive work over a couple weeks,

550
00:24:40.435 --> 00:24:44.614
that contract actually went 180.

551
00:24:44.614 --> 00:24:47.774
And, everybody finally agreed that it was

552
00:24:47.774 --> 00:24:50.566
an impossible thing just a week or two before.

553
00:24:50.566 --> 00:24:53.766
And, that brought in half of their whole income

554
00:24:53.766 --> 00:24:56.371
for the whole year from just this one sale,

555
00:24:56.371 --> 00:24:58.502
this company's you know, it was huge.

556
00:24:58.502 --> 00:25:00.102
<v Regina>That's an amazing story,</v>

557
00:25:00.102 --> 00:25:03.622
but what I'm hearing you say is that this person,

558
00:25:03.622 --> 00:25:06.438
this one that contracted you to work with them,

559
00:25:06.438 --> 00:25:09.234
was able to go into a greater state of coherence,

560
00:25:09.234 --> 00:25:13.862
into a higher frequency, and somehow it magnetized, yeah.

561
00:25:13.862 --> 00:25:17.254
It affected the rest, even the other people unconsciously

562
00:25:17.254 --> 00:25:20.070
started tuning to this higher potential outcome.

563
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:22.930
<v ->That's exactly what happened and that's just one</v>

564
00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.598
of hundreds of examples we could talk about.

565
00:25:25.598 --> 00:25:27.730
<v Regina>So, let's talk about it in a family.</v>

566
00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:29.330
Have you ever worked with family dynamics?

567
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:31.570
<v ->I have actually, I hadn't prepared to say anything</v>

568
00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:35.346
about that, but absolutely, I mean family is an incredible

569
00:25:35.346 --> 00:25:37.394
group of souls, coming together to work things out.

570
00:25:37.394 --> 00:25:39.314
<v Regina>Well, some of them, like we said, moving back in</v>

571
00:25:39.314 --> 00:25:41.278
with each other and maybe haven't worked things out yet.

572
00:25:41.278 --> 00:25:43.774
Let's talk about some of what you've done,

573
00:25:43.774 --> 00:25:45.566
maybe what you've seen, maybe even an example.

574
00:25:45.566 --> 00:25:47.998
I love examples.

575
00:25:47.998 --> 00:25:52.998
<v ->In family, yeah, most of my examples</v>

576
00:25:53.733 --> 00:25:55.909
were centered around healings and things like that.

577
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:57.317
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->You know, I would have to</v>

578
00:25:57.317 --> 00:25:58.673
go back in and remember some of.

579
00:25:58.673 --> 00:26:00.189
<v Regina>Yeah, just kind of give us theoretically, some</v>

580
00:26:00.189 --> 00:26:02.705
of what you see happen when one person is really attuned.

581
00:26:02.705 --> 00:26:05.500
<v ->Well, we've seen a lot of dysfunction in families</v>

582
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.956
when they are trying to cohabitate together and

583
00:26:08.956 --> 00:26:13.180
with a willingness of the family's part, we've worked,

584
00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:16.036
you work with the family as an entity, so the entity

585
00:26:16.036 --> 00:26:19.644
is the family energy and then all the subsets are the,

586
00:26:19.644 --> 00:26:23.460
you know, the mom, dad, and kids and even animals.

587
00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:28.028
And so, we can address that energy, or the entity,

588
00:26:28.028 --> 00:26:30.116
what we call it, of the family just like we address

589
00:26:30.116 --> 00:26:33.252
the entity of a company or the individual, the control

590
00:26:33.252 --> 00:26:36.752
systems within an individual as a health participant.

591
00:26:36.752 --> 00:26:40.548
And, we can address the family, we do address the family

592
00:26:40.548 --> 00:26:43.516
as an entity and what happens is that there's

593
00:26:43.516 --> 00:26:45.884
quite a bit more harmony.

594
00:26:45.884 --> 00:26:47.759
It doesn't work out everybody's stuff completely,

595
00:26:47.759 --> 00:26:50.556
but the harmony and the alignment starts to get

596
00:26:50.556 --> 00:26:52.067
better and better.

597
00:26:52.067 --> 00:26:55.164
People either become part of that new harmony,

598
00:26:55.164 --> 00:26:57.787
or they put more resistance and then kind of back out

599
00:26:57.787 --> 00:27:00.003
to where they're not part of the group.

600
00:27:00.003 --> 00:27:01.731
That could happen, too.

601
00:27:01.731 --> 00:27:03.291
You know, it's not just one way.

602
00:27:03.291 --> 00:27:06.555
In the case of company, employees might leave if they're

603
00:27:06.555 --> 00:27:10.075
not in harmony with the mission or the goals and the

604
00:27:10.075 --> 00:27:11.931
intentions that the company is now furthering

605
00:27:11.931 --> 00:27:13.339
and putting into motion.

606
00:27:13.339 --> 00:27:15.023
<v Regina>So let's talk about how one person,</v>

607
00:27:15.023 --> 00:27:17.383
I mean it's really one person, that usually will contact

608
00:27:17.383 --> 00:27:21.563
you to work with them, but let's say this one person

609
00:27:21.563 --> 00:27:24.592
who is watching and maybe can't contact you for

610
00:27:24.592 --> 00:27:27.536
whatever reason, and their family is in disharmony,

611
00:27:27.536 --> 00:27:29.648
or their relationship is in disharmony,

612
00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:32.080
how can they work within themselves, and I know

613
00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.048
we already talked about this a little bit, but how can they

614
00:27:35.048 --> 00:27:37.224
work within themselves to shift a dynamic

615
00:27:37.224 --> 00:27:38.332
within the whole.

616
00:27:38.332 --> 00:27:39.935
<v ->We try to give them a little homework, and there's</v>

617
00:27:39.935 --> 00:27:42.367
a lot of things that you can do.

618
00:27:42.367 --> 00:27:43.807
In the business world we have what we call the

619
00:27:43.807 --> 00:27:47.327
optimal outcome, with in individual we just ask them

620
00:27:47.327 --> 00:27:49.287
to start looking at the picture of where they

621
00:27:49.287 --> 00:27:51.315
really want to be.

622
00:27:51.315 --> 00:27:53.127
<v Regina>And you have to feel.</v>

623
00:27:53.127 --> 00:27:57.439
<v ->Yeah, we give them a whole lot of awareness, and we</v>

624
00:27:57.439 --> 00:27:59.078
also help them with the conscious languaging of how

625
00:27:59.078 --> 00:28:02.047
they can see that picture.

626
00:28:02.047 --> 00:28:04.095
And once the pictures clarified, and we call that the

627
00:28:04.095 --> 00:28:06.390
transform to state, the state that they're trying

628
00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:07.573
to move into.

629
00:28:07.573 --> 00:28:10.537
Then we tell them, don't try to move into it,

630
00:28:10.537 --> 00:28:13.653
just occupy it, just like the occupy Wall Street,

631
00:28:13.653 --> 00:28:16.513
just keep occupying it, occupying the space,

632
00:28:16.513 --> 00:28:19.285
and let that imagination and the feeling

633
00:28:19.285 --> 00:28:23.489
and play with it, and if you do your part

634
00:28:23.489 --> 00:28:25.429
on this bigger picture, you know, of what you're

635
00:28:25.429 --> 00:28:28.161
moving into, and maybe other individuals, say in

636
00:28:28.161 --> 00:28:31.819
the case of family, do their part, and when we

637
00:28:31.819 --> 00:28:34.635
do our part, what we do, it just keeps furthering

638
00:28:34.635 --> 00:28:36.939
the potential of the creation.

639
00:28:36.939 --> 00:28:39.435
And so, yes, you can bring families into more harmony,

640
00:28:39.435 --> 00:28:40.827
it's not impossible.

641
00:28:40.827 --> 00:28:43.737
It's a big thing to make changes.

642
00:28:43.737 --> 00:28:45.482
<v Regina>Oh yeah, it is, I mean you can't expect</v>

643
00:28:45.482 --> 00:28:47.167
perfection, you're not gonna have people just

644
00:28:47.167 --> 00:28:48.339
turn around on a dime.

645
00:28:48.339 --> 00:28:49.983
<v ->But you can get a lot more function going</v>

646
00:28:49.983 --> 00:28:52.074
and coherency, you know, in a family.

647
00:28:52.074 --> 00:28:54.954
<v Regina>So is it fair to say that as you,</v>

648
00:28:54.954 --> 00:28:59.954
again, create this state of higher, finer, brighter

649
00:29:00.371 --> 00:29:04.254
energies, or coherence within yourself, within your

650
00:29:04.254 --> 00:29:07.646
emotional being, within your mind, that

651
00:29:07.646 --> 00:29:11.423
the more discordant frequencies will often give way

652
00:29:11.423 --> 00:29:13.746
to the more coherent frequencies?

653
00:29:13.746 --> 00:29:15.838
Is that how this works energetically?

654
00:29:15.838 --> 00:29:18.334
<v ->Well, that's definitely one intrament pattern</v>

655
00:29:18.334 --> 00:29:20.338
that has, starts to happen, absolutely.

656
00:29:20.338 --> 00:29:23.410
I mean it is, it's really amazing, I mean, like I

657
00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.398
worked with a lady who, she had no use of her,

658
00:29:26.398 --> 00:29:29.598
no ability to use her legs after a certain point

659
00:29:29.598 --> 00:29:31.626
after several weeks.

660
00:29:31.626 --> 00:29:33.118
Her legs would start to get so weak

661
00:29:33.118 --> 00:29:34.610
that she couldn't use them.

662
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:36.041
<v Regina>What was wrong with her?</v>

663
00:29:36.041 --> 00:29:37.740
<v ->Some type of an autoimmune disease.</v>

664
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:38.880
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

665
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.691
<v ->So she would go in every month for a</v>

666
00:29:40.691 --> 00:29:43.507
blood plasma injection of ten thousand dollars.

667
00:29:43.507 --> 00:29:44.639
<v Regina>Oh my god.</v>

668
00:29:44.639 --> 00:29:46.598
<v ->At the tune of ten to 12 thousand dollars, and she was</v>

669
00:29:46.598 --> 00:29:49.203
doing this for a year before I saw her.

670
00:29:49.203 --> 00:29:52.294
So she came to me and we found the disharmonies

671
00:29:52.294 --> 00:29:54.406
going on and what was causing the autoimmune

672
00:29:54.406 --> 00:29:58.438
issue, and very, probably about six months of just

673
00:29:58.438 --> 00:30:02.003
working with her, she started to get better and better.

674
00:30:02.003 --> 00:30:05.350
The infusions went longer and longer, like six, eight weeks,

675
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:06.867
and then ten weeks apart and so on.

676
00:30:06.867 --> 00:30:09.726
Then one day, it was gone.

677
00:30:09.726 --> 00:30:11.902
<v Regina>Was it an emotional issue?</v>

678
00:30:11.902 --> 00:30:14.630
<v ->There were emotions involved, and there almost always</v>

679
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:16.294
are in autoimmune, cause you're attacking your own

680
00:30:16.294 --> 00:30:17.982
self in an autoimmune disease.

681
00:30:17.982 --> 00:30:20.838
It's the body trying to get you to see that you're doing

682
00:30:20.838 --> 00:30:22.246
something to yourself.

683
00:30:22.246 --> 00:30:25.510
And yeah, she had to work on certain things, and

684
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:28.198
there was so many different faucets, of course, that

685
00:30:28.198 --> 00:30:31.762
you can do in the healing work, things like this.

686
00:30:31.762 --> 00:30:34.446
But the point is, is that even in these type of deeper

687
00:30:34.446 --> 00:30:37.070
situations, you can bring harmony back into a field.

688
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:40.078
In this case if was a field of her nerve system in her legs.

689
00:30:40.078 --> 00:30:41.422
<v Regina>And you see this a lot.</v>

690
00:30:41.422 --> 00:30:42.210
<v ->All the time.</v>

691
00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:43.362
<v Regina>I mean that's what you do, of course.</v>

692
00:30:43.362 --> 00:30:45.146
That's why people come back, because you see this,

693
00:30:45.146 --> 00:30:48.438
you're effective at facilitating the harmonization

694
00:30:48.438 --> 00:30:50.102
of these energies again.

695
00:30:50.102 --> 00:30:52.554
Now, this is a little off topic, but

696
00:30:52.554 --> 00:30:55.670
I just wanna toss this out there.

697
00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:58.973
We are ad the Edgar Cayce Institute recently, A.R.E.,

698
00:30:58.973 --> 00:31:02.518
back in Virginia Beach and I, of course, am a great

699
00:31:02.518 --> 00:31:06.186
appreciator of what came through Edgar Cayce

700
00:31:06.186 --> 00:31:08.445
during those 40 years of his life.

701
00:31:08.445 --> 00:31:10.685
One thing that struck me as I was reading some

702
00:31:10.685 --> 00:31:13.949
of the books, and reading his biography by Sidney

703
00:31:13.949 --> 00:31:18.949
Kirkpatrick, was there seemed to be not only emotional

704
00:31:19.709 --> 00:31:24.709
involvement, but often times, the cerebrospinal

705
00:31:24.746 --> 00:31:27.626
involvement in the strangest ways where someone

706
00:31:27.626 --> 00:31:29.546
would be going blind and they would say oh well

707
00:31:29.546 --> 00:31:31.381
that was bump that occurred to the spine when

708
00:31:31.381 --> 00:31:33.706
the child was six years of age and maybe there was a

709
00:31:33.706 --> 00:31:35.773
pooling of some kind of fluids between a couple

710
00:31:35.773 --> 00:31:37.781
discs or whatnot.

711
00:31:37.781 --> 00:31:41.493
But, shockingly, over and over and over, people

712
00:31:41.493 --> 00:31:44.585
are looking for what's going on in their body, and

713
00:31:44.585 --> 00:31:47.293
it kept going back to the spinal column.

714
00:31:47.293 --> 00:31:50.709
And I know, you know a lot about the spinal column.

715
00:31:50.709 --> 00:31:53.340
What is it going on within the being, the psyche,

716
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:57.415
the spirit, the soul, the fluids, and spinal system?

717
00:31:57.415 --> 00:31:59.143
How does this play into our reality?

718
00:31:59.143 --> 00:32:01.852
<v ->Well, it's a lot because the way spirit gets stepped</v>

719
00:32:01.852 --> 00:32:03.879
down to the different levels of life, and then we

720
00:32:03.879 --> 00:32:05.243
run it through a physical body.

721
00:32:05.243 --> 00:32:06.799
It animates your physical body,

722
00:32:06.799 --> 00:32:08.635
whether you look at it through a meridian standpoint

723
00:32:08.635 --> 00:32:10.859
or from a neurological standpoint, it is the life force

724
00:32:10.859 --> 00:32:13.823
coming down into your bioelectric force.

725
00:32:13.823 --> 00:32:17.111
And it records everything that ever happens to you

726
00:32:17.111 --> 00:32:18.751
in your existence, basically.

727
00:32:18.751 --> 00:32:20.139
They're all little memories.

728
00:32:20.139 --> 00:32:22.955
And along with these memories, are physiological states

729
00:32:22.955 --> 00:32:24.171
that happen.

730
00:32:24.171 --> 00:32:27.115
In the case of the cerebrospinal fluid, which is a pump

731
00:32:27.115 --> 00:32:29.867
between the sacrum and the brain, it's constantly

732
00:32:29.867 --> 00:32:31.218
going through the spinal column, through the

733
00:32:31.218 --> 00:32:33.290
meninges and out through the nerves.

734
00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.614
That can be disrupted in any type of shock,

735
00:32:35.614 --> 00:32:37.278
or trauma, or anything.

736
00:32:37.278 --> 00:32:40.798
That can go into a memory state along with everything else.

737
00:32:40.798 --> 00:32:43.273
A lot of times, you unquirk these memories and then the

738
00:32:43.273 --> 00:32:44.937
physiologies change with them.

739
00:32:44.937 --> 00:32:46.238
<v Regina>So that's why you were so big on</v>

740
00:32:46.238 --> 00:32:47.410
osteopathy in the day?

741
00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:48.754
<v ->Yeah.</v>

742
00:32:48.754 --> 00:32:50.654
<v Regina>It makes sense, I mean, chiropractic.</v>

743
00:32:50.654 --> 00:32:51.870
<v ->Yeah, oh absolutely.</v>

744
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:54.558
I mean to free neurological interference

745
00:32:54.558 --> 00:32:58.098
or meridian interference, it's a huge step, and a big

746
00:32:58.098 --> 00:33:01.214
contribution toward healing and toward, even,

747
00:33:01.214 --> 00:33:03.369
in the nerve system of a company.

748
00:33:03.369 --> 00:33:05.985
If you can imagine, we actually do adjustments,

749
00:33:05.985 --> 00:33:09.678
it's on a whole other level, but it has a template of

750
00:33:09.678 --> 00:33:12.193
seeing this central nerve system come through the company.

751
00:33:12.193 --> 00:33:14.797
<v Regina>So what I'm seeing here is, look at what's</v>

752
00:33:14.797 --> 00:33:17.677
happening culturally, is there is a big movement,

753
00:33:17.677 --> 00:33:19.445
certainly in the United States and other countries

754
00:33:19.445 --> 00:33:22.305
as well, toward embracing yoga as a normal part

755
00:33:22.305 --> 00:33:24.245
of our lifestyle now.

756
00:33:24.245 --> 00:33:28.173
The beauty of that is that you're constantly flexing

757
00:33:28.173 --> 00:33:32.205
and adjusting the spinal column and making,

758
00:33:32.205 --> 00:33:35.725
allowing these fluids to move more easily.

759
00:33:35.725 --> 00:33:38.669
So when were talking about, maybe there's a much larger

760
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:40.909
picture is what I'm saying, that when we're looking

761
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:44.301
at going into coherence on a psycho spiritual,

762
00:33:44.301 --> 00:33:47.029
emotional level to create an outcome in our own lives

763
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:51.341
or in a group situation, the mere fact that we might be

764
00:33:51.341 --> 00:33:54.240
participating in yoga and freeing these blockages

765
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.992
within our, even within our spine and breaking free

766
00:33:56.992 --> 00:34:00.020
these memories on that level could be feeding into this.

767
00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.364
I mean it's all feeding each other.

768
00:34:01.364 --> 00:34:04.180
<v ->Oh yeah, these are all very complimentary to it.</v>

769
00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:07.124
One of the things when you're in the manifestation,

770
00:34:07.124 --> 00:34:09.408
one of the things that is so important is to reach

771
00:34:09.408 --> 00:34:11.348
a point of stillness, after you form your desire and

772
00:34:11.348 --> 00:34:14.484
everything, you go into this point of stillness or just

773
00:34:14.484 --> 00:34:16.340
physical immobility.

774
00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.776
During that time, you can access and then from there

775
00:34:19.776 --> 00:34:23.336
you can spin out and allow some of the transformation

776
00:34:23.336 --> 00:34:24.512
to take place.

777
00:34:24.512 --> 00:34:26.280
It's the same thing in yoga, and other things

778
00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.032
where you get to a certain stillness, you

779
00:34:29.032 --> 00:34:30.507
release certain tensions of the body.

780
00:34:30.507 --> 00:34:31.968
<v Regina>At the end, you always do the still practice.</v>

781
00:34:31.968 --> 00:34:36.968
<v ->Yeah, and out of that stillness is a very valuable part</v>

782
00:34:37.044 --> 00:34:40.351
of your, a moment in your life where out of that,

783
00:34:40.351 --> 00:34:42.911
then can come the changes that you're trying to manifest.

784
00:34:42.911 --> 00:34:44.788
<v Regina>So that's why a yoga teacher always says</v>

785
00:34:44.788 --> 00:34:47.796
be aware that this moment of stillness at the end of the

786
00:34:47.796 --> 00:34:50.444
class is just as important as all the work you've just done.

787
00:34:50.444 --> 00:34:52.620
And you're explaining why that is true.

788
00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:56.735
Interesting, okay, one thing we were going to talk about,

789
00:34:56.735 --> 00:35:00.596
I wrote down here because we all do it, and within

790
00:35:00.596 --> 00:35:03.775
the patterns of stuckness we're talking about, is this

791
00:35:03.775 --> 00:35:06.527
notion of a Law of Assumption that goes on.

792
00:35:06.527 --> 00:35:09.235
<v ->Yeah, that's huge, the Law of Assumption,</v>

793
00:35:09.235 --> 00:35:14.235
I mean that is life itself, that is the mastery of life.

794
00:35:14.975 --> 00:35:18.409
If you want to master life you master the Law of Assumption.

795
00:35:18.409 --> 00:35:21.737
It's you that creates your assumptions, and whatever

796
00:35:21.737 --> 00:35:23.997
you're living out in your outer life, right now,

797
00:35:23.997 --> 00:35:26.685
it's the assumptions that you've made in the past.

798
00:35:26.685 --> 00:35:31.685
The Law of Assumption is something that you must

799
00:35:33.129 --> 00:35:36.052
pay attention to.

800
00:35:36.052 --> 00:35:38.909
What are you assuming in your own consciousness?

801
00:35:38.909 --> 00:35:43.197
This is the means for you to ultimately become

802
00:35:43.197 --> 00:35:44.820
master of your existence.

803
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.400
If you can control your attention and bring enough feeling

804
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:52.221
and enter into this whole assumptive process

805
00:35:52.221 --> 00:35:54.676
you can build yourself out of any situation,

806
00:35:54.676 --> 00:35:56.916
you can move your corporation or company further

807
00:35:56.916 --> 00:36:00.092
than where it's at right now, and you can move yourself

808
00:36:00.092 --> 00:36:02.696
into a state of health in ways that you hadn't.

809
00:36:02.696 --> 00:36:05.724
But you have to form certain assumptions, and that

810
00:36:05.724 --> 00:36:08.220
goes into the the consciousness, and once you

811
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.568
impregnate them with the feelings and other things,

812
00:36:10.568 --> 00:36:12.552
huge changes take place.

813
00:36:12.552 --> 00:36:14.664
<v Regina>Give us an example of someone kind of,</v>

814
00:36:14.664 --> 00:36:18.504
say an assumption that an individual or a company had.

815
00:36:18.504 --> 00:36:20.680
And I've had you write down a couple of examples

816
00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.428
over there so that you can easily access them

817
00:36:22.428 --> 00:36:24.156
cause you've done thousands of these.

818
00:36:24.156 --> 00:36:26.460
It's like me when people say, "What's your favorite

819
00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:27.656
interview you've ever done".

820
00:36:27.656 --> 00:36:29.640
Oh my god, I have so many.

821
00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.115
So if you can find an example of where assumption

822
00:36:32.115 --> 00:36:33.692
has really blocked someone and the freeing

823
00:36:33.692 --> 00:36:34.952
of that has helped.

824
00:36:34.952 --> 00:36:38.003
<v ->Well an example, yeah, there's a lot of examples.</v>

825
00:36:38.003 --> 00:36:41.736
I mean I look at my own life, you know, and I had

826
00:36:41.736 --> 00:36:46.736
certain assumptions lets say going back to the Vietnam Era,

827
00:36:47.111 --> 00:36:50.588
and I had certain assumptions that

828
00:36:52.338 --> 00:36:55.645
I didn't know what I wanted to do because I was in such

829
00:36:55.645 --> 00:36:57.245
an array of confusion.

830
00:36:57.245 --> 00:37:01.469
I started to rebuild my life again after I did enough

831
00:37:01.469 --> 00:37:03.752
journaling, I started to say, "What do I really want

832
00:37:03.752 --> 00:37:05.864
to do in my life, what do I want to manifest"?

833
00:37:05.864 --> 00:37:07.825
And it came back to I started to create

834
00:37:07.825 --> 00:37:08.721
certain assumptions.

835
00:37:08.721 --> 00:37:11.240
Well, I want to create something with my hands.

836
00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.652
I'm not a tool person, I don't go out and build thing much.

837
00:37:14.652 --> 00:37:16.488
I want to do something with my hands.

838
00:37:16.488 --> 00:37:18.876
I want to do something where my mind can stay

839
00:37:18.876 --> 00:37:21.756
very much engaged in life, and learning, and whirling.

840
00:37:21.756 --> 00:37:23.761
I want to have something that's mobile enough

841
00:37:23.761 --> 00:37:27.388
wherever I am on the earth, I can do this,

842
00:37:27.388 --> 00:37:29.672
whatever skill it would be, with me.

843
00:37:29.672 --> 00:37:32.891
Out of those assumptions, formed my connections

844
00:37:32.891 --> 00:37:36.155
to chiropractic, which then I went on to get my doctorate,

845
00:37:36.155 --> 00:37:38.695
and went on to do practice in, for you know,

846
00:37:38.695 --> 00:37:40.423
the last 25 years.

847
00:37:40.423 --> 00:37:44.283
It was those assumptions that started my life down this path

848
00:37:44.283 --> 00:37:46.587
and it took me a while to get em, but when I got to the

849
00:37:46.587 --> 00:37:49.723
assumption of who I was and what I was wanting

850
00:37:49.723 --> 00:37:53.394
to accomplish, then everything fell into, but it was

851
00:37:53.394 --> 00:37:57.202
the power of the assumption that led me down that path.

852
00:37:57.202 --> 00:37:58.910
<v Regina>Now, when I'm listening to you,</v>

853
00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:00.766
what's the difference between an assumption and

854
00:38:00.766 --> 00:38:02.214
an intention, then?

855
00:38:02.214 --> 00:38:04.946
Because it sounds like that's, or a desire even.

856
00:38:04.946 --> 00:38:07.250
<v ->An intention is the formation of a desire.</v>

857
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:08.018
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

858
00:38:08.018 --> 00:38:09.726
<v ->And the assumption is the realization.</v>

859
00:38:09.726 --> 00:38:11.346
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

860
00:38:11.346 --> 00:38:13.758
<v ->You're bringing yourself into the now moment.</v>

861
00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:16.894
You can't do any assumption in the future or the past,

862
00:38:16.894 --> 00:38:18.750
you can only bring it and control it in the moment

863
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:19.774
of the now.

864
00:38:19.774 --> 00:38:22.226
Once you do that, everything starts to click.

865
00:38:22.226 --> 00:38:24.446
<v Regina>It's interesting, and you know, this whole</v>

866
00:38:24.446 --> 00:38:27.858
notion of assumption was really hitting me when I was

867
00:38:27.858 --> 00:38:30.501
traveling, I was traveling a lot the last couple of weeks,

868
00:38:30.501 --> 00:38:32.210
and you're on airplanes, and sitting in airports,

869
00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:34.021
and I love to just watch people go by.

870
00:38:34.021 --> 00:38:35.749
I'm a great people watcher.

871
00:38:35.749 --> 00:38:38.930
Sometimes, you find yourself going into an assumption,

872
00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:41.341
i.e. Judgement about someone.

873
00:38:41.341 --> 00:38:43.109
You know, you assess them and the way they're

874
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:46.501
speaking and one, there was this one for example,

875
00:38:46.501 --> 00:38:47.741
it really got me going.

876
00:38:47.741 --> 00:38:50.257
There was this fellow sitting across from me, and he

877
00:38:50.257 --> 00:38:53.245
was very kind of frightening looking, you know really

878
00:38:53.245 --> 00:38:56.445
severe got, and tattoos on the head, shaved, and

879
00:38:56.445 --> 00:38:58.685
tattoos everywhere on his body, and had a very

880
00:38:58.685 --> 00:39:00.645
harsh looking demeanor.

881
00:39:00.645 --> 00:39:04.509
He pulls his cell phone out, and he calls home.

882
00:39:04.509 --> 00:39:08.477
Hello pumpkin, hi sweetie pie, how's the little baby doing?

883
00:39:08.477 --> 00:39:11.357
Give her a little, and he went, everything was some kind,

884
00:39:11.357 --> 00:39:14.833
a term of endearment, and just the most beautiful

885
00:39:14.833 --> 00:39:18.205
sweet words flowing from this man's mouth that was

886
00:39:18.205 --> 00:39:20.484
nothing like what you would think, cause he put on

887
00:39:20.484 --> 00:39:25.484
this scary exterior and it hit me, how often we

888
00:39:26.244 --> 00:39:30.044
take ourselves down into a negative place by making

889
00:39:30.044 --> 00:39:32.476
an assumption about someone else when we could

890
00:39:32.476 --> 00:39:35.588
just as readily assume something beautiful in that person.

891
00:39:35.588 --> 00:39:36.868
Just for fun.

892
00:39:36.868 --> 00:39:40.324
It changes your whole energy feel though, your openness,

893
00:39:40.324 --> 00:39:43.420
your receptivity, so I'd assume everyone that walked by,

894
00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:45.489
I assumed oh that thing under their arm,

895
00:39:45.489 --> 00:39:47.492
maybe they created a beautiful piece of artwork.

896
00:39:47.492 --> 00:39:49.308
<v ->See it's your state of consciousness,</v>

897
00:39:49.308 --> 00:39:54.308
and nothing can be, nothing can come to you

898
00:39:54.896 --> 00:39:57.712
unless it's through your own state of consciousness.

899
00:39:57.712 --> 00:40:01.276
You have to open that state, you have to earn the right,

900
00:40:01.276 --> 00:40:03.044
almost, to have that state of consciousness

901
00:40:03.044 --> 00:40:05.308
by investing in it, not spending it, but investing

902
00:40:05.308 --> 00:40:08.164
your time and your energy into it.

903
00:40:08.164 --> 00:40:10.788
Your consciousness is everything, that is what then starts

904
00:40:10.788 --> 00:40:12.432
to change the outer reality.

905
00:40:12.432 --> 00:40:15.267
The whole idea is that people look at facts, and they

906
00:40:15.267 --> 00:40:19.132
think that's it, but it's the subjective interior that opens

907
00:40:19.132 --> 00:40:21.411
up that whole ballgame.

908
00:40:21.411 --> 00:40:23.120
<v Regina>What it was a whole different feeling when I</v>

909
00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.872
thought why did I assume just because someone is

910
00:40:25.872 --> 00:40:28.131
trying to look tough that they are tough.

911
00:40:28.131 --> 00:40:31.036
That's an assumption that's so wrong.

912
00:40:31.036 --> 00:40:33.059
I mean everybody has tattoos anyway, now.

913
00:40:33.059 --> 00:40:36.240
I mean, obviously, but he was just extra scary looking,

914
00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.371
and in fact, this was one of the sweetest sounding

915
00:40:38.371 --> 00:40:39.888
people I had ever heard.

916
00:40:39.888 --> 00:40:41.744
<v ->Judgments, judgments.</v>

917
00:40:41.744 --> 00:40:43.515
<v Regina>Yeah, and so if we assume the best,</v>

918
00:40:43.515 --> 00:40:46.288
as soon as I realized that, my heart lifted, my evergy

919
00:40:46.288 --> 00:40:49.723
field lifted, and I felt wonderful even though I thought

920
00:40:49.723 --> 00:40:51.984
wow, that was a shotty thought on my part.

921
00:40:51.984 --> 00:40:54.800
I was assuming the worst of this guy when if fact,

922
00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.827
this guy is delightful.

923
00:40:56.827 --> 00:40:58.787
That made me look at others that way.

924
00:40:58.787 --> 00:41:01.455
Now, I'm going around with kind of a buzzy glowing

925
00:41:01.455 --> 00:41:05.083
energy because I'm choosing to imagine or assume

926
00:41:05.083 --> 00:41:06.147
the best of people.

927
00:41:06.147 --> 00:41:08.155
<v ->You know, it's interesting how you create</v>

928
00:41:08.155 --> 00:41:11.375
your reality as whatever you're seeing.

929
00:41:11.375 --> 00:41:13.679
This all goes back to quantum physics, your clefts,

930
00:41:13.679 --> 00:41:17.897
and these quantum fields, by how you're seeing.

931
00:41:18.242 --> 00:41:20.911
And so when you saw that man in a whole different

932
00:41:20.911 --> 00:41:24.770
light, you collapsed a whole different field that then

933
00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:27.931
allowed more flow between you and him as well.

934
00:41:27.931 --> 00:41:30.831
You helped to define a new reality in your consciousness.

935
00:41:30.831 --> 00:41:34.523
That's the transformed two state, basically what we call.

936
00:41:34.523 --> 00:41:35.650
<v Regina>Expand on that a little bit</v>

937
00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:36.911
for all of our use, here.

938
00:41:36.911 --> 00:41:38.874
<v ->Yeah, the transform from state is where you're at</v>

939
00:41:38.874 --> 00:41:42.138
right now in your consciousness, and all that you think,

940
00:41:42.138 --> 00:41:45.807
believe is true, and so on.

941
00:41:45.807 --> 00:41:50.050
Your transform to state is the imagined state of now

942
00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:54.274
you have realized the changes that you're intending.

943
00:41:54.274 --> 00:41:57.242
The transform to state carries resistances and burdens as

944
00:41:57.242 --> 00:42:01.186
well to reach into that reality but that's the very nature,

945
00:42:01.186 --> 00:42:04.858
the core, of the work that we do, and to support the

946
00:42:04.858 --> 00:42:07.246
individual on their own, as well to move into the states.

947
00:42:07.246 --> 00:42:10.232
<v Regina>And it really is to our advantage.</v>

948
00:42:10.232 --> 00:42:11.322
<v ->States of consciousness.</v>

949
00:42:11.322 --> 00:42:15.502
<v Regina>Yes, and the defense mechanism</v>

950
00:42:15.502 --> 00:42:17.978
that we've taken on individually and collectively in the

951
00:42:17.978 --> 00:42:20.897
western world of cynicism

952
00:42:20.897 --> 00:42:24.378
is really a distroyer in that sense.

953
00:42:24.378 --> 00:42:26.316
I mean we've seen movies, and characters,

954
00:42:26.316 --> 00:42:27.737
and read about characters in books that are

955
00:42:27.737 --> 00:42:29.189
eternally optimistic.

956
00:42:29.189 --> 00:42:31.065
There was a cute little British film called

957
00:42:31.065 --> 00:42:34.309
Happy Go Lucky that was out a couple of years ago.

958
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:38.232
The girl was just hopelessly optimistic, and of course,

959
00:42:38.232 --> 00:42:40.113
half the people that watched the movie thought

960
00:42:40.113 --> 00:42:42.584
what a moron that she'd be so optimistic when

961
00:42:42.584 --> 00:42:44.721
clearly things aren't going her way, and of course,

962
00:42:44.721 --> 00:42:48.261
the other half think you go, you're able to keep it up

963
00:42:48.261 --> 00:42:51.333
even when things aren't going your way, which of course,

964
00:42:51.333 --> 00:42:53.041
ultimately they did.

965
00:42:53.041 --> 00:42:55.729
But this mass cynicism being fed by all these factors

966
00:42:55.729 --> 00:42:58.456
we talked about in the very beginning of our interview,

967
00:42:58.456 --> 00:43:02.562
including media, somehow we have to unplug

968
00:43:02.562 --> 00:43:05.269
from the cynicism.

969
00:43:05.269 --> 00:43:07.765
<v ->Well, at some point, you get to the point where you</v>

970
00:43:07.765 --> 00:43:09.621
realize that it's just you.

971
00:43:09.621 --> 00:43:10.669
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

972
00:43:10.669 --> 00:43:12.866
<v ->And your own whole world is what you're creating</v>

973
00:43:12.866 --> 00:43:16.109
inside yourself, it's not about all the facts and all the

974
00:43:16.109 --> 00:43:19.117
things that are outside you, and the illusion is all these

975
00:43:19.117 --> 00:43:21.165
other people that you see around you are outside you,

976
00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:22.293
they're not.

977
00:43:22.293 --> 00:43:24.405
They have a fragment of the light, just as you do,

978
00:43:24.405 --> 00:43:27.349
and that light all comes in through these shining,

979
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:31.317
incredible sheets of light in the inner worlds known,

980
00:43:31.317 --> 00:43:33.281
as some people refer to, as the god head.

981
00:43:33.281 --> 00:43:36.673
We're all connected, it's just an illusion that we're,

982
00:43:36.673 --> 00:43:40.001
and there are some great forces on the Earth now

983
00:43:40.001 --> 00:43:43.181
trying to move our financial systems and other means now

984
00:43:43.181 --> 00:43:47.463
toward the ends that are being described.

985
00:43:48.513 --> 00:43:51.540
Good things trying to happen, and it's all come

986
00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:54.381
because we are connecting back into our humanity.

987
00:43:54.381 --> 00:43:57.172
There's been forces that have been just driven

988
00:43:57.172 --> 00:44:00.717
us the opposite direction as a life form on the Earth.

989
00:44:00.717 --> 00:44:03.060
We're trying to bring that all back, now, and the people

990
00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:06.092
that are holding that space are like

991
00:44:06.092 --> 00:44:07.777
this person that you said.

992
00:44:07.777 --> 00:44:10.996
There's more negativity than positivity in this world

993
00:44:10.996 --> 00:44:13.089
only in the sense of the way that this world

994
00:44:13.089 --> 00:44:15.009
and matter is formed.

995
00:44:15.009 --> 00:44:19.105
But, the people who are making breakthroughs and

996
00:44:19.105 --> 00:44:21.708
transcending parts of themselves and so on, these are

997
00:44:21.708 --> 00:44:23.628
the people who are lifting the consciousness to make

998
00:44:23.628 --> 00:44:26.080
these new possibilities happen, even in this dense,

999
00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.936
physical world.

1000
00:44:27.936 --> 00:44:31.372
<v Regina>And even though a lot of the younger people</v>

1001
00:44:31.372 --> 00:44:34.804
feel helpless and hopeless, like you did back during

1002
00:44:34.804 --> 00:44:38.836
those times, there is still a different level of

1003
00:44:38.836 --> 00:44:41.676
consciousness that's flowing through the younger

1004
00:44:41.676 --> 00:44:45.172
generations now as a result of what they were born into.

1005
00:44:45.172 --> 00:44:47.411
What they chose to be born into.

1006
00:44:47.411 --> 00:44:51.104
So somehow, I don't know how to even articulate it,

1007
00:44:51.104 --> 00:44:54.003
even if they don't have hope that they're going to find

1008
00:44:54.003 --> 00:44:58.256
a job anytime soon, and forget owning a house, and so on.

1009
00:44:58.256 --> 00:45:02.412
What is this thing I'm detecting that's flowing through them

1010
00:45:02.412 --> 00:45:06.176
and through us that's somehow shining through anyway?

1011
00:45:06.176 --> 00:45:08.565
<v ->Well they have a lot of flexibility,</v>

1012
00:45:08.565 --> 00:45:11.488
I have never seen kids with more flexibility that are

1013
00:45:11.488 --> 00:45:14.152
growing into young adults as the new generation

1014
00:45:14.152 --> 00:45:18.164
that's here now, and they have the advantage that we

1015
00:45:18.164 --> 00:45:21.364
didn't have, in some ways, being connected up

1016
00:45:21.364 --> 00:45:22.432
technologically.

1017
00:45:22.432 --> 00:45:24.968
That can be a disadvantage, too, but a lot of these kids,

1018
00:45:24.968 --> 00:45:28.424
though, they're really growing and maturing into a way

1019
00:45:28.424 --> 00:45:29.920
of having great flexibility.

1020
00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.968
The more flexibility you have in your view point in life,

1021
00:45:32.968 --> 00:45:35.784
the more you'll be able to kind of move through it

1022
00:45:35.784 --> 00:45:39.156
with greater ease or at least with greater flow.

1023
00:45:39.156 --> 00:45:41.543
That's a quality of soul, too.

1024
00:45:41.543 --> 00:45:45.364
It has a 360 view point and these kids are coming in, and

1025
00:45:45.364 --> 00:45:48.032
they're seeing a lot more, and they're conscious of

1026
00:45:48.032 --> 00:45:50.695
a lot more, and the possibility, and they are

1027
00:45:50.695 --> 00:45:53.556
basically, their experience is going to be to kind of

1028
00:45:53.556 --> 00:45:56.263
unravel the experience that our generations have created,

1029
00:45:56.263 --> 00:45:59.271
and to bring forth a whole other energy.

1030
00:45:59.271 --> 00:46:02.279
Who knows what that'll end up like, but there is no

1031
00:46:02.279 --> 00:46:04.756
ending, it just keeps continuing and unfolding,

1032
00:46:04.756 --> 00:46:07.911
It will be a great interest to see if the younger

1033
00:46:07.911 --> 00:46:10.471
generation steps up and creates a whole, kind of new,

1034
00:46:10.471 --> 00:46:13.439
way of relating in the universe compared to what we've had.

1035
00:46:13.439 --> 00:46:15.359
<v Regina>Maybe there's not as much self judgment,</v>

1036
00:46:15.359 --> 00:46:19.263
and maybe everybody texting out the lmao and so forth,

1037
00:46:19.263 --> 00:46:21.971
maybe it's just don't take it so seriously.

1038
00:46:21.971 --> 00:46:25.300
Okay, things look crumby right now, but who cares,

1039
00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:27.959
hey meet me and let's party or whatnot.

1040
00:46:27.959 --> 00:46:30.412
That maybe there's just a little loser attachment,

1041
00:46:30.412 --> 00:46:33.143
where in the 60's people took the Vietnam War

1042
00:46:33.143 --> 00:46:35.980
and what was going on deeply seriously.

1043
00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:38.028
I mean, we know some of the events,

1044
00:46:38.028 --> 00:46:40.119
people were willing to put their lives on the line for it.

1045
00:46:40.119 --> 00:46:44.151
The occupying movement is doing that as well, but there's

1046
00:46:44.151 --> 00:46:47.042
still a different quality, it's a lighter quality,

1047
00:46:47.042 --> 00:46:50.901
there's more of a holistic desired outcome it seems, now.

1048
00:46:50.901 --> 00:46:54.786
<v ->Maybe so, and this whole idea of occupying Wall Street,</v>

1049
00:46:54.786 --> 00:46:58.005
as I said earlier, occupy the state of consciousness

1050
00:46:58.005 --> 00:47:01.141
in you that has the vision, and the creative imagination,

1051
00:47:01.141 --> 00:47:03.509
and control your attention, and put it into

1052
00:47:03.509 --> 00:47:06.626
the wish fulfilled, and put it there, and that's

1053
00:47:06.626 --> 00:47:08.738
where you're gonna get, and once you're involved in the

1054
00:47:08.738 --> 00:47:11.253
creation process and the manifestation processes, you'll

1055
00:47:11.253 --> 00:47:13.069
feel like you're partnering with life.

1056
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:15.925
It's a whole different level of feeling, you feel more

1057
00:47:15.925 --> 00:47:18.765
connected, you feel more certain, and you're happier

1058
00:47:18.765 --> 00:47:20.705
too, because you've learned some of the secrets of

1059
00:47:20.705 --> 00:47:23.323
manifestation on larger levels.

1060
00:47:23.457 --> 00:47:26.229
I didn't use to understand the artist, and when I was young,

1061
00:47:26.229 --> 00:47:28.319
but now I understand that they're just creating, and

1062
00:47:28.319 --> 00:47:29.516
creating, and creating.

1063
00:47:29.516 --> 00:47:31.455
They're trying to establish form in their lives, too,

1064
00:47:31.455 --> 00:47:33.612
and structure through that.

1065
00:47:33.612 --> 00:47:36.620
The creational process, we must never give it up,

1066
00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:39.031
no matter what station in life that we're at, the

1067
00:47:39.031 --> 00:47:42.551
creation process, the imagined states, we can always

1068
00:47:42.551 --> 00:47:44.940
take ourselves to another level or to another state

1069
00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:48.287
of consciousness and we're constantly trying to satisfy

1070
00:47:48.287 --> 00:47:49.951
all these different states.

1071
00:47:49.951 --> 00:47:52.407
We have a verascious appetite, and we're trying

1072
00:47:52.407 --> 00:47:54.303
to appease that appetite by going through these

1073
00:47:54.303 --> 00:47:55.647
different states.

1074
00:47:55.647 --> 00:47:58.123
After a while, you realize that anger doesn't work anymore.

1075
00:47:58.123 --> 00:48:01.559
After a while, you realize that maybe I'm not the victim,

1076
00:48:01.559 --> 00:48:04.031
maybe I need to take control of my life, maybe it's my

1077
00:48:04.031 --> 00:48:07.487
states of consciousness that are the important thing,

1078
00:48:07.487 --> 00:48:12.159
maybe if I changed myself other things will take place.

1079
00:48:13.879 --> 00:48:16.297
That's where we need to focus, we need to do our

1080
00:48:16.297 --> 00:48:18.818
homework, and we need to start getting ourselves out

1081
00:48:18.818 --> 00:48:22.514
and serving life more in whatever ways that we're drawn to.

1082
00:48:22.514 --> 00:48:25.906
You know, helping the other person, a part of ourself,

1083
00:48:25.906 --> 00:48:29.085
have that outflow, helping our health, return ourself

1084
00:48:29.085 --> 00:48:31.944
to a sense of sanity in our own body, and clear up

1085
00:48:31.944 --> 00:48:33.777
some of our health states.

1086
00:48:33.777 --> 00:48:36.488
Most of these health states are driven by just anxieties,

1087
00:48:36.488 --> 00:48:39.345
and fears, programming that you took on from the past

1088
00:48:39.345 --> 00:48:42.945
and our culture of food, etcetera.

1089
00:48:43.085 --> 00:48:46.554
<v Regina>On that note, Thom, I think you've pretty much</v>

1090
00:48:46.554 --> 00:48:51.246
done the perfect full circle on this conversation unless

1091
00:48:51.246 --> 00:48:53.785
there's something else you want to interject, I just love

1092
00:48:53.785 --> 00:48:56.281
what you said, that really encapsulates all of it.

1093
00:48:56.281 --> 00:48:58.585
<v ->Well, I have about five more hours.</v>

1094
00:48:58.585 --> 00:49:01.122
<v Regina>Well since we can't do that right now,</v>

1095
00:49:01.122 --> 00:49:03.790
in lieu of five more hours, is there any other kind of

1096
00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:05.497
encapsulating statement beyond that,

1097
00:49:05.497 --> 00:49:06.690
that you'd like to share.

1098
00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:09.058
<v ->Yeah, there's gotta be something more.</v>

1099
00:49:09.058 --> 00:49:12.700
<v Regina>I know you have some notes over there.</v>

1100
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:15.565
<v ->I didn't get to say everything I wanted to say, but</v>

1101
00:49:15.565 --> 00:49:19.769
in the facilitation process that I do, we do use scaler

1102
00:49:19.769 --> 00:49:22.925
technologies, we do use repetitive forms of being able,

1103
00:49:22.925 --> 00:49:25.442
on a larger level, to come in and reinforce

1104
00:49:25.442 --> 00:49:27.938
the intentions that are set forth within an individual

1105
00:49:27.938 --> 00:49:30.521
for their health, or within a company for their success

1106
00:49:30.521 --> 00:49:31.777
and prosperity.

1107
00:49:31.777 --> 00:49:36.556
It's a huge thing, to be able to work with, and gifts, that

1108
00:49:36.556 --> 00:49:39.308
we've been able to work with the more advanced ways

1109
00:49:39.308 --> 00:49:41.784
of helping speed the process up a little bit and

1110
00:49:41.784 --> 00:49:44.344
regaining your health, helping speed the process up

1111
00:49:44.344 --> 00:49:46.520
in a company going through it's transformations

1112
00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:49.955
and it's changes, and

1113
00:49:49.955 --> 00:49:51.916
this is the way that I serve.

1114
00:49:51.916 --> 00:49:55.884
As a facilitator, facilitating the empowerment, facilitating

1115
00:49:55.884 --> 00:49:58.956
the consciousness, and facilitating possibilities that

1116
00:49:58.956 --> 00:50:01.283
exist in everyone.

1117
00:50:01.283 --> 00:50:03.031
<v Regina>And you've been doing so beautifully for</v>

1118
00:50:03.031 --> 00:50:06.316
many years now, and on that note, thank you so much.

1119
00:50:06.316 --> 00:50:08.407
It's been wonderful talking with you, again.

1120
00:50:08.407 --> 00:50:10.685
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1121
00:50:11.735 --> 00:50:14.487
<v ->His words rang very true for me, I simply daydream</v>

1122
00:50:14.487 --> 00:50:17.283
my outcomes by being persistent in what I want,

1123
00:50:17.283 --> 00:50:20.291
gently living it forward, as it were, until the moment

1124
00:50:20.291 --> 00:50:22.723
feels as real as this very moment.

1125
00:50:22.723 --> 00:50:24.683
To lean more about Thom's work, please feel free

1126
00:50:24.683 --> 00:50:27.095
to watch our previous interview where he goes into

1127
00:50:27.095 --> 00:50:29.099
the mechanics of the energy fields

1128
00:50:29.099 --> 00:50:30.763
we're all bathed within.

1129
00:50:30.763 --> 00:50:32.619
To reach Thom, you can go to his website at

1130
00:50:32.619 --> 00:50:37.015

1131
00:50:37.015 --> 00:50:40.124
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
