<v ->You What the Bleep fans will love this one.</v>

2
00:00:03.688 --> 00:00:05.808
In the movie we heard bits and pieces

3
00:00:05.808 --> 00:00:07.748
from each of the scientists and doctors.

4
00:00:07.748 --> 00:00:10.288
Here, you can hear the entire story from

5
00:00:10.288 --> 00:00:12.587
Dr. Stuard Hammeroff, who tells us about

6
00:00:12.587 --> 00:00:15.747
the on board computers in ourselves

7
00:00:15.747 --> 00:00:17.347
called microtubules.

8
00:00:17.347 --> 00:00:19.347
If you've seen our interview with Vernon Wolf,

9
00:00:19.347 --> 00:00:21.587
you'll know that these little fields of pure potential

10
00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:23.327
within the cells of our body,

11
00:00:23.327 --> 00:00:25.362
are what drive us and define us.

12
00:00:25.362 --> 00:00:27.422
Here, Stuart addresses how it all

13
00:00:27.422 --> 00:00:29.182
works in the world of quantum physics,

14
00:00:29.182 --> 00:00:31.442
and what we can take away from this knowledge.

(music)

16
00:00:41.302 --> 00:00:42.281
[Interviewer] First of all, you're still a

17
00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:45.682
practicing anesthesiologist, and if you can give me

18
00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:49.041
a little bit of an idea how anesthesiology and

19
00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:53.404
the world of quantum theroy started coming togeather

20
00:00:53.404 --> 00:00:54.923
in your life, I'd like to know about that.

21
00:00:54.923 --> 00:00:58.203
<v ->Well, I actually chose anesthesiology partly to understand</v>

22
00:00:58.203 --> 00:01:00.604
consciousness, and how the brain produced consciousness.

23
00:01:00.604 --> 00:01:03.104
I had always been interested in that question

24
00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:04.864
from college and medical school and thought about

25
00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:08.144
neurology, psychiatry, and neurosurgery dealing

26
00:01:08.144 --> 00:01:10.884
with the brain, but I was convinced by my former chairman,

27
00:01:10.884 --> 00:01:13.423
Burnell Brown, who is the chief of anesthesiology

28
00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:15.843
at the University of Arizona, that to understand

29
00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:18.204
consciousness the best approach was

30
00:01:18.204 --> 00:01:20.744
to understand how anesthetics erase consciousness.

31
00:01:20.744 --> 00:01:24.384
And that is because the gas anesthetics, at least,

32
00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:27.664
are fairly selective, in that you breathe them in,

33
00:01:27.664 --> 00:01:29.824
and they go into your lungs, into the blood, into the brain,

34
00:01:29.824 --> 00:01:32.523
and many brain activities continue,

35
00:01:32.523 --> 00:01:34.724
many bodily functions continue,

36
00:01:34.724 --> 00:01:36.724
only, at just the right concentration,

37
00:01:36.724 --> 00:01:38.824
pretty much only consciousness is effected.

38
00:01:38.824 --> 00:01:42.803
You can still have fairly normal EEG evol potentials

39
00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:46.004
control the breathing, but consciousness is erased.

40
00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:49.584
It turns out that the gases work, only by very weak

41
00:01:49.584 --> 00:01:51.204
quantum mechanical forces.

42
00:01:51.204 --> 00:01:52.703
They don't form any chemical bonds.

43
00:01:52.703 --> 00:01:54.424
So, when you turn the vaporizer off,

44
00:01:54.424 --> 00:01:56.444
the gases get pulled out and the patient wakes up.

45
00:01:56.444 --> 00:01:59.724
[Interviewer] Where does quantum mechanics fit in with this?

46
00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:02.564
First, on a very populous level, so you can explain it

47
00:02:02.564 --> 00:02:04.843
to myself and everybody watching this.

48
00:02:04.843 --> 00:02:08.543
How do these two worlds interface and our brain,

49
00:02:08.543 --> 00:02:11.424
when we go into that strange world where we're

50
00:02:11.424 --> 00:02:13.023
seeing things that we don't normally see,

51
00:02:13.023 --> 00:02:15.184
we're wondering if we're here or if we're there,

52
00:02:15.184 --> 00:02:16.789
or even alive anymore.

53
00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:20.059
All that happens when we're under the influence

54
00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:21.139
of an anesthetic.

55
00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.169
What's going on?

56
00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:24.699
<v ->Well, first of all to explain quantum mechanics,</v>

57
00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:26.398
or quantum theory in a general sense,

58
00:02:26.408 --> 00:02:29.959
the, our world is really described by two sets of laws.

59
00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.489
You might almost say they're two worlds.

60
00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.919
There's the classical, everyday world where things

61
00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:36.138
are definite, and there's the quantum world that's

62
00:02:36.138 --> 00:02:38.998
small scale, so, though exactly how small is unclear.

63
00:02:38.998 --> 00:02:42.379
Where things are quite indefinate, and things can be

64
00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.278
in two or more places at the same time,

65
00:02:44.278 --> 00:02:47.979
separated from themselves, things can be interconnected

66
00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:50.119
over great distances and seemingly together,

67
00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:52.139
even when they're separated, and things

68
00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.819
can condense into one object.

69
00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.478
These are all, and time doesn't flow.

70
00:02:56.478 --> 00:02:59.298
These are all, um, characteristics of the quantum world.

71
00:02:59.298 --> 00:03:01.599
The classical world, as I said, is definite.

72
00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.778
And I think in a very general sense, the subconscious,

73
00:03:03.778 --> 00:03:06.159
our dream world, the kind of situations the you described,

74
00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:11.159
relates to the quantum world, and our consciousness

75
00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.119
is actually the transition between that quantum world

76
00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:15.459
and the classical world.

77
00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.319
So, it's kind of a boundary between, consciousnesses

78
00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.919
exists on the boundary between

79
00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.889
the quantum world and the classical world.

80
00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.839
[Interviewer] So picking up on what you said a moment ago,

81
00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:29.759
in the quantum world time is not linear,

82
00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:34.759
um, the space that an atom is occupying can be more

83
00:03:35.018 --> 00:03:39.319
than one at the same time, a particle can become

84
00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.879
a wave, um, this is a very indefinite sort of world,

85
00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.459
and, which would beg the question, then can we

86
00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.999
and what we're doing right here actually exist in

87
00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:52.579
another place and time, for example?

88
00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.629
<v ->Well, some people think there are multiple universes,</v>

89
00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:56.698
parallel universes, and that's

90
00:03:56.698 --> 00:03:58.519
one interpretation of quantum mechanics,

91
00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.359
but the apparent randomness and indefinite nature

92
00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.519
of quantum mechanics, may only be in the measurement

93
00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.719
decoherance, and it could be that the underlying

94
00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:11.999
substructure of the quantum world is actually,

95
00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:15.399
contains information and, in fact, possibly even

96
00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:17.619
platonic information, according to Roger Penrose.

97
00:04:17.619 --> 00:04:19.579
and Freeman Dysonn, for example.

98
00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.299
[Interviewer] Can you explain platonic information,

99
00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.339
simply at first, so that we get a structure to work with?

100
00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:25.399
<v ->Yeah.</v>

101
00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:27.579
Well, Plato, the Greek philosopher said that there was

102
00:04:27.579 --> 00:04:31.799
an absolute realm of, a realm of absolute truths

103
00:04:31.799 --> 00:04:33.819
and pure forms.

104
00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.599
For example, mathematical equations are one example.

105
00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.719
And also, perhaps, ethical values and aesthetic values,

106
00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:43.079
and, exist in what he described as

107
00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:45.579
an abstract, non-physical realm.

108
00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:50.379
Well, Roger Penrose suggested that the substructure

109
00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:53.779
of the universe, at the most tiny level,

110
00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.919
called the Planck scale, is actually structured

111
00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.019
and contains platonic information.

112
00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:01.679
Platonic information like mathematical truths.

113
00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:05.099
Things that are not invented, but are discovered by

114
00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.319
many people, are actually embedded, as truths

115
00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:10.019
at this fundamental level.

116
00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:11.199
[Interviewer] - Geometry as well?

117
00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:12.059
<v ->Correct.</v>

118
00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:16.459
Geometry, mathematics and perhaps other truths, too.

119
00:05:18.454 --> 00:05:22.034
[interviewer] In this way, the rediscovery quote, of quote

120
00:05:22.034 --> 00:05:24.730
sacred geometry for example, or what is being called

121
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.670
sacred geometry in more spiritually based disciplines,

122
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.393
for example, is that emanating from this understanding that

123
00:05:33.393 --> 00:05:35.973
this in it's most minute form at the base

124
00:05:35.973 --> 00:05:37.693
of the cosmic functioning?

125
00:05:37.693 --> 00:05:38.813
<v ->It could be.</v>

126
00:05:38.813 --> 00:05:42.973
I think any discovery, potentially, is actually uncovered

127
00:05:42.973 --> 00:05:46.333
and discovered, rather than invented by anybody.

128
00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:49.513
Um, you could argue about that,

129
00:05:49.513 --> 00:05:51.513
but that's the basic idea that truths, absolute truth

130
00:05:51.513 --> 00:05:54.173
exists in a real, physical sense,

131
00:05:54.173 --> 00:05:56.153
but way, way down there at the

132
00:05:56.153 --> 00:05:57.833
bottom floor of the universe, so the connection

133
00:05:57.833 --> 00:05:59.813
to it is very difficult and very subtle

134
00:05:59.813 --> 00:06:02.193
and only highly evolved biological systems,

135
00:06:02.193 --> 00:06:05.733
at least thus far, are able to be influenced by it.

136
00:06:05.733 --> 00:06:08.353
[Interviewer] So if you start at the base, with

137
00:06:08.353 --> 00:06:13.212
mathematics, geometry, um, etcetera, is this,

138
00:06:13.212 --> 00:06:15.493
you used the word coherence a moment ago,

139
00:06:15.493 --> 00:06:19.993
is this an incoherent field, and coherence

140
00:06:19.993 --> 00:06:22.133
is created out if it?

141
00:06:22.133 --> 00:06:24.193
Can you talk a little bit about what makes us,

142
00:06:24.193 --> 00:06:28.073
um, not so random, and our lives not so random?

143
00:06:28.073 --> 00:06:33.073
<v ->Well, um, randomness versus, the real question is</v>

144
00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:36.753
are we purely algorithmic, are we random,

145
00:06:36.753 --> 00:06:38.053
or are we something else?

146
00:06:38.053 --> 00:06:42.113
Um, the ah, and this was actually Roger's first approach

147
00:06:42.113 --> 00:06:45.473
toward the problem, artificial intelligence, who would say

148
00:06:45.473 --> 00:06:48.833
that the brain works algorithmically.

149
00:06:48.833 --> 00:06:53.033
The brain works by, um, processes that a computer could do.

150
00:06:53.033 --> 00:06:56.152
That if A then B, that if B then D, and so forth,

151
00:06:56.152 --> 00:06:58.393
and follows this path by preset rules.

152
00:06:58.393 --> 00:07:01.613
And, ah, Penrose suggested that the brain,

153
00:07:01.613 --> 00:07:03.733
and then the other type of decision would be random,

154
00:07:03.733 --> 00:07:05.773
just flip a coin and whatever that is, that's what you do.

155
00:07:05.773 --> 00:07:07.693
But, Penrose suggested that consciousness

156
00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:10.613
uses something else, that he called noncomputable,

157
00:07:10.613 --> 00:07:13.733
and he argued from something called Godel's theorem,

158
00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:15.573
to suggest that understanding, knowing,

159
00:07:15.573 --> 00:07:18.113
must come from outside the system.

160
00:07:18.113 --> 00:07:20.213
So that algorithmic processes can never

161
00:07:20.213 --> 00:07:21.733
really know and understand.

162
00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:23.733
And therefore, computers can never really be conscious.

163
00:07:23.733 --> 00:07:27.673
The only other type of process, other than

164
00:07:27.673 --> 00:07:32.333
algorithmic, deterministic, determinism and randomness

165
00:07:32.333 --> 00:07:35.293
was the choices made in a particular type of

166
00:07:35.293 --> 00:07:38.013
collapse of the wave function, that he had proposed

167
00:07:38.013 --> 00:07:40.193
as a solution to the measurement problem

168
00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:41.793
in quantum mechanics.

169
00:07:41.793 --> 00:07:44.933
So he was kind of killing three or four birds with one stone

170
00:07:44.933 --> 00:07:47.733
with this proposal suggesting that to solve the problem

171
00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:51.293
of super position how large a--

172
00:07:51.293 --> 00:07:53.733
[Interviewer] Explain super position. You just did this

173
00:07:53.733 --> 00:07:55.373
in a lecture, so you probably don't know what

174
00:07:55.373 --> 00:07:58.012
you've said to whom at this moment.

175
00:07:58.012 --> 00:08:00.633
<v ->Super position is something being in two or more</v>

176
00:08:00.633 --> 00:08:02.533
places or states at the same time.

177
00:08:02.533 --> 00:08:05.053
And the best example is Shroderinger's cat.

178
00:08:05.053 --> 00:08:08.393
Now, early days of quantum theory suggested that

179
00:08:08.393 --> 00:08:12.537
an object, the particle will stay in super position until

180
00:08:12.537 --> 00:08:14.977
it was observed by a conscious observer.

181
00:08:14.977 --> 00:08:17.357
And it seems that even if a machine measured

182
00:08:17.357 --> 00:08:20.075
a superposition, that the results and the machine

183
00:08:20.075 --> 00:08:21.735
stayed in super position until

184
00:08:21.735 --> 00:08:23.315
somebody looked at the results.

185
00:08:23.315 --> 00:08:26.695
And this, this is what the experiment seemed to show.

186
00:08:26.695 --> 00:08:29.735
Now, Shroderinger, a quantum physicist of some renown,

187
00:08:29.735 --> 00:08:33.355
thought this was silly, and he proposed a thought experiment

188
00:08:33.355 --> 00:08:36.835
in which a quantum event, for example a photon

189
00:08:36.835 --> 00:08:38.555
passing through a half silvered mirror.

190
00:08:38.555 --> 00:08:41.605
So it has a 50% chance of going through and a

191
00:08:41.605 --> 00:08:43.435
50% chance of being reflected.

192
00:08:43.435 --> 00:08:46.275
Say if it's reflected it goes into a box and releases

193
00:08:46.275 --> 00:08:47.995
a vial or poison.

194
00:08:47.995 --> 00:08:50.715
The box contains a cat, and the box is sealed.

195
00:08:50.715 --> 00:08:54.735
So, if it's reflected it releases the poison

196
00:08:54.735 --> 00:08:55.955
and the cat is dead.

197
00:08:55.955 --> 00:08:58.055
If it goes through, the poison's

198
00:08:58.055 --> 00:08:59.635
not released, the cat's alive.

199
00:08:59.635 --> 00:09:02.955
Because it's a quantum particle, the photon

200
00:09:02.955 --> 00:09:05.275
both goes through and does not go through

201
00:09:05.275 --> 00:09:10.275
therefore the poison is released and not released,

202
00:09:10.335 --> 00:09:13.115
therefore the cat is both dead and alive,

203
00:09:13.115 --> 00:09:15.171
until someone opens the box and looks at it.

204
00:09:15.171 --> 00:09:17.251
[Interviewer] So basically, this is saying that both

205
00:09:17.251 --> 00:09:18.751
possibilities exist?

206
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:21.311
<v ->Until someone looks at it.</v>

207
00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:22.171
[Interviewer] Observes it?

208
00:09:22.171 --> 00:09:23.371
<v ->Yeah, the conscious observer.</v>

209
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:26.311
And he, Shroderinger, pointed this out to show how silly

210
00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:30.256
was the idea, because, you know, how could a system

211
00:09:30.256 --> 00:09:32.556
as large as a cat be amplified from a

212
00:09:32.556 --> 00:09:36.556
tiny quantum system like a photon.

213
00:09:36.556 --> 00:09:37.931
The problem is, nobody could really say for sure why

214
00:09:37.931 --> 00:09:39.411
the cat wouldn't be both dead and alive,

215
00:09:39.411 --> 00:09:42.531
nor how large a quantity a quantum system could become.

216
00:09:42.531 --> 00:09:45.311
There's no apparent limit, or boundary,

217
00:09:45.311 --> 00:09:46.732
or reason that it couldn't.

218
00:09:46.732 --> 00:09:49.852
And so Shroderinger's cat problem is still with us.

219
00:09:49.852 --> 00:09:53.111
There some other, ah, explanations for

220
00:09:53.111 --> 00:09:54.491
quantum super position.

221
00:09:54.491 --> 00:09:55.392
One is that each possibility branches off

222
00:09:55.392 --> 00:09:58.322
to form a whole new universe,

223
00:09:58.322 --> 00:10:00.531
the multiple worlds hypothesis.

224
00:10:00.531 --> 00:10:04.091
The other is decoherence, that any interaction with

225
00:10:04.091 --> 00:10:06.731
the environment, the classical world causes

226
00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:08.211
the system to erode.

227
00:10:08.211 --> 00:10:10.811
But that doesn't account for isolated super positions,

228
00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:13.851
nor does it really destroy the super position.

229
00:10:13.851 --> 00:10:15.651
It just kinda mixes it with noise.

230
00:10:15.651 --> 00:10:18.692
The other possibility is what Penrose suggested.

231
00:10:18.692 --> 00:10:21.351
Others suggested different types of thresholds,

232
00:10:21.351 --> 00:10:23.351
but the idea that quantum super position,

233
00:10:23.351 --> 00:10:26.471
when it gets large enough and persists long enough,

234
00:10:26.471 --> 00:10:29.571
will reach some threshold intrinsic to nature,

235
00:10:29.571 --> 00:10:31.152
and self collapse.

236
00:10:31.152 --> 00:10:33.912
So that, and by the way this is used in quantum computing.

237
00:10:33.912 --> 00:10:38.451
Um, quantum computers use, instead of bits of one or zero,

238
00:10:38.451 --> 00:10:40.471
as regular computers, they use quantum bits,

239
00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:43.212
superposition of one and zero.

240
00:10:43.212 --> 00:10:46.152
And the quantum bits communicate with each other

241
00:10:46.152 --> 00:10:49.171
by this spooky, non-local entanglement,

242
00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:51.898
and do incredibly efficient computing,

243
00:10:51.898 --> 00:10:54.588
and after a while collapses to one,

244
00:10:54.588 --> 00:10:56.403
each one chose one or zero, and this type

245
00:10:56.403 --> 00:10:58.542
of quantum computing can do incredibly

246
00:10:58.542 --> 00:11:00.982
efficient and complex computations.

247
00:11:00.982 --> 00:11:04.582
So, um, collapsing means going from the quantum world

248
00:11:04.582 --> 00:11:07.423
to the classical world, reducing or collapsing.

249
00:11:07.423 --> 00:11:10.623
The question is, would a quantum system, by itself,

250
00:11:10.623 --> 00:11:13.622
ever reduce or collapse, or if something,

251
00:11:13.622 --> 00:11:15.923
according to Copenhagen interpretation, if we're not looking

252
00:11:15.923 --> 00:11:17.762
at a building even, could it be in two or more

253
00:11:17.762 --> 00:11:19.222
places at the same time.

254
00:11:19.222 --> 00:11:21.263
It seems ridiculous, but there's no obvious--

255
00:11:21.263 --> 00:11:23.003
[Interviewer] So, our observation actually creates

256
00:11:23.003 --> 00:11:26.022
a coherence or a structure to that possibility?

257
00:11:26.022 --> 00:11:29.442
<v ->Ah, the Copenhagen interpretation would say that</v>

258
00:11:29.442 --> 00:11:34.382
observation causes reduction or collapse to one.

259
00:11:34.382 --> 00:11:37.402
But, Penrose and others said that, no there's some

260
00:11:37.402 --> 00:11:39.822
intrinsic feature to the universe, that if a super position

261
00:11:39.822 --> 00:11:43.162
reaches large enough, or goes on long enough

262
00:11:43.162 --> 00:11:46.242
it would self collapse, undergo what he called

263
00:11:46.242 --> 00:11:49.062
objective reduction and he proposed

264
00:11:49.062 --> 00:11:51.242
a type of objective reduction that involved

265
00:11:51.242 --> 00:11:53.702
the universe itself.

266
00:11:53.702 --> 00:11:56.223
And the idea that, well, how can somebody, something

267
00:11:56.223 --> 00:11:57.962
be in two places at the same time,

268
00:11:57.962 --> 00:11:59.602
I mean, that's the real issue.

269
00:11:59.602 --> 00:12:02.243
And, like the multiple worlds hypothesis,

270
00:12:02.243 --> 00:12:05.043
he said that if super position is a branching or bifurcation

271
00:12:05.043 --> 00:12:09.422
of the universe at a very tiny, fundamental level,

272
00:12:09.422 --> 00:12:10.843
what's called the Planck scale.

273
00:12:10.843 --> 00:12:13.943
And in the multiple worlds view these super positions

274
00:12:13.943 --> 00:12:16.243
each would evolve to form a whole new universe.

275
00:12:16.243 --> 00:12:20.362
But in the Penrose approach, the super positions are

276
00:12:20.362 --> 00:12:22.922
like bubbles in reality, or blisters.

277
00:12:22.922 --> 00:12:27.362
And they're unstable and they will collapse, choose one

278
00:12:27.362 --> 00:12:29.162
or the other and because they are built into

279
00:12:29.162 --> 00:12:32.302
this Platonic world, the choices are influenced by

280
00:12:32.302 --> 00:12:35.102
Platonic information embedded in

281
00:12:35.102 --> 00:12:36.602
the fundamental levels, so that.

282
00:12:36.602 --> 00:12:38.622
And this, he argued, was characteristic

283
00:12:38.622 --> 00:12:39.982
of conscious thought.

284
00:12:39.982 --> 00:12:42.782
So, as I said, he was killing several birds with one stone,

285
00:12:42.782 --> 00:12:47.403
cause, cause the separation is, kind brings relativity

286
00:12:47.403 --> 00:12:51.103
to quantum mechanics, and it solved, potentially solved

287
00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:52.882
the problem of Shroderinger's cat, and how large

288
00:12:52.882 --> 00:12:54.303
a super position could be.

289
00:12:54.303 --> 00:12:57.542
And it also explained consciousness, in that it could,

290
00:12:57.542 --> 00:13:00.762
we could function in a way that was

291
00:13:00.762 --> 00:13:04.183
not stictly algorithmic, we could be free thinkers,

292
00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:05.402
to some extent.

293
00:13:05.402 --> 00:13:06.862
Not random, but something else,

294
00:13:06.862 --> 00:13:09.503
We could allow ourselves to be influenced by

295
00:13:09.503 --> 00:13:13.242
this giant look up table, if you will, that exists

296
00:13:13.242 --> 00:13:14.543
throughout the universe.

297
00:13:14.543 --> 00:13:17.622
[Interviewer] Look up table, what's that?

298
00:13:17.622 --> 00:13:20.762
<v ->Well, that's another way of describing the Platonic realm,</v>

299
00:13:20.762 --> 00:13:23.142
of information embedded everywhere at

300
00:13:23.142 --> 00:13:25.023
the most fundamental level.

301
00:13:25.023 --> 00:13:28.162
[Interviewer] That information, we won't try

302
00:13:28.162 --> 00:13:30.943
to source it, per se, but might that information

303
00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:35.943
you say, be responsible for, maybe even be given

304
00:13:36.343 --> 00:13:40.902
some part of the word, the observer, might it be

305
00:13:40.902 --> 00:13:45.103
part of a field of intelligence that creates a coherence

306
00:13:45.103 --> 00:13:47.182
of sorts, or a structure of sorts?

307
00:13:47.182 --> 00:13:50.643
<v ->Well, my, uh, Freeman Dyson said that mind and</v>

308
00:13:50.643 --> 00:13:52.962
intelligence are woven into the fabric of the universe.

309
00:13:52.962 --> 00:13:56.763
And, what this is saying is that it's happening at

310
00:13:56.763 --> 00:13:59.382
the most fundamental level, at the Planck scale.

311
00:13:59.382 --> 00:14:01.562
And the Penrose proposal was a way that our

312
00:14:01.562 --> 00:14:04.182
biological brains could connect to that level.

313
00:14:04.182 --> 00:14:07.382
I wouldn't day the level is the, well you could say

314
00:14:07.382 --> 00:14:10.082
the level is the observer, but consciousness is

315
00:14:10.082 --> 00:14:13.282
actually the process of accessing that.

316
00:14:13.282 --> 00:14:15.082
It's kind of a ripple through this

317
00:14:15.082 --> 00:14:18.122
fundamental level, if you will.

318
00:14:18.122 --> 00:14:21.930
[Interviewer] If you're saying that on a quantum level,

319
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.631
even on a cellular level, and beyond, in our body

320
00:14:24.631 --> 00:14:27.410
we're functioning as quantum computers, of sorts,

321
00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:31.596
where, what is the intelligence or guiding force

322
00:14:31.596 --> 00:14:33.963
that created such a structure?

323
00:14:33.963 --> 00:14:37.056
<v ->Well, our brains use a lot of, you know,</v>

324
00:14:37.056 --> 00:14:39.696
normal processes, you know, it's not all

325
00:14:39.696 --> 00:14:41.695
quantum computation, but we take advantage of this.

326
00:14:41.695 --> 00:14:45.036
But if you're asking where the Platonic information

327
00:14:45.036 --> 00:14:45.856
came from--

328
00:14:45.856 --> 00:14:46.655
[Interviewer] Yes.

329
00:14:46.655 --> 00:14:47.616
<v ->I thought you were asking that.</v>

330
00:14:47.616 --> 00:14:48.735
(laughter)

331
00:14:48.735 --> 00:14:50.235
[Interviewer] You just put it much better than I did.

332
00:14:50.235 --> 00:14:51.296
<v ->That's a tougher question.</v>

333
00:14:51.296 --> 00:14:52.396
[Interviewer] As a layperson.

334
00:14:52.396 --> 00:14:54.856
<v ->Right, so where'd the Platonic information come from?</v>

335
00:14:54.856 --> 00:14:56.515
And I asked Roger that once, and he said,

336
00:14:56.515 --> 00:14:58.176
the big bang, where else could it come from.

337
00:14:58.176 --> 00:15:01.455
And, ah, I said, yeah, where else could it come from.

338
00:15:01.455 --> 00:15:03.456
Um, because that's what created

339
00:15:03.456 --> 00:15:05.195
the structure of the universe.

340
00:15:05.195 --> 00:15:08.635
So, interestingly enough, there is another theory,

341
00:15:08.635 --> 00:15:09.839
and I don't know if Roger, well,

342
00:15:09.839 --> 00:15:10.779
Roger knows about it, but I don't know

343
00:15:10.779 --> 00:15:11.999
what he thinks about it.

344
00:15:11.999 --> 00:15:16.129
There's an Italian astrophysicist named Paola Zizzi,

345
00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:19.863
who, okay, during the big bang the universe

346
00:15:19.863 --> 00:15:23.662
literally began and exploded and expanded

347
00:15:23.662 --> 00:15:26.243
very,very rapidly, this is called inflation.

348
00:15:26.243 --> 00:15:29.823
And after a time, a very short time,

349
00:15:29.823 --> 00:15:31.643
a fraction of a fraction of a second,

350
00:15:31.643 --> 00:15:33.463
the rapid expansion stopped and it's

351
00:15:33.463 --> 00:15:35.263
been growing very slowly ever since.

352
00:15:35.263 --> 00:15:37.263
So, people are trying to explain

353
00:15:37.263 --> 00:15:39.603
the rapid inflation and then why it stopped,

354
00:15:39.603 --> 00:15:41.323
why the slowing down occurred.

355
00:15:41.323 --> 00:15:46.283
And, ah, Roger has an equation for this objective reduction,

356
00:15:46.283 --> 00:15:48.663
such that super positions, when they reach,

357
00:15:48.663 --> 00:15:52.103
well, depending on their size, basically,

358
00:15:52.103 --> 00:15:55.483
will collapse at a certain time.

359
00:15:55.483 --> 00:15:58.043
The larger the super position, the faster it will collapse.

360
00:15:58.043 --> 00:16:02.103
So, anyway, Paola Zizzi calculated that the mass

361
00:16:02.103 --> 00:16:05.793
of the early universe was, matched

362
00:16:05.793 --> 00:16:07.883
the time of the end of inflation.

363
00:16:07.883 --> 00:16:11.427
So, what she is saying is that during inflation

364
00:16:11.427 --> 00:16:13.587
there were multiple universes,

365
00:16:13.587 --> 00:16:16.047
multiple possible universes, and they

366
00:16:16.047 --> 00:16:18.893
expanded and then reached Roger's

367
00:16:18.893 --> 00:16:20.509
threshold for self collapse,

368
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:23.637
and then reduced to one particular universe,

369
00:16:23.637 --> 00:16:26.197
choosing our universe and things have

370
00:16:26.197 --> 00:16:27.997
been expanding ever since.

371
00:16:27.997 --> 00:16:31.057
Well, by the Penrose criteria, that's a conscious

372
00:16:31.057 --> 00:16:33.737
event, which means that during the big bang,

373
00:16:33.737 --> 00:16:36.497
the entire universe had a cosmic conscious moment.

374
00:16:36.497 --> 00:16:39.917
And, actually someone, somebody has dubbed

375
00:16:39.917 --> 00:16:41.717
this theory, the big wow theory.

376
00:16:41.717 --> 00:16:43.657
Because it's a variant of the big bang theory,

377
00:16:43.657 --> 00:16:45.697
in which the universe actually had a conscious moment.

378
00:16:45.697 --> 00:16:50.137
And Paola also points out the number of cubits in our brain

379
00:16:50.137 --> 00:16:51.897
is the same as the number of cubits

380
00:16:51.897 --> 00:16:53.937
that register at that moment.

381
00:16:53.937 --> 00:16:56.645
So that our consciousness is, is literally a microcosm

382
00:16:56.645 --> 00:16:59.265
of the, of the whole universe.

383
00:16:59.265 --> 00:17:02.965
Which is a pretty bold statement to make,

384
00:17:02.965 --> 00:17:05.905
but the numbers seems to match up.

385
00:17:05.905 --> 00:17:08.065
But it also suggests, that we've pretty much,

386
00:17:08.065 --> 00:17:10.685
if I understand it correctly, we've pretty much

387
00:17:10.685 --> 00:17:12.585
plateaued in the amount of, at least

388
00:17:12.585 --> 00:17:15.205
intelligence, possibly consciousness, that we can have.

389
00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:16.925
I hope that's not the case, but it could be.

390
00:17:16.925 --> 00:17:20.765
[Interviewer] In terms of the amount of consciousness?

391
00:17:20.765 --> 00:17:24.125
<v ->Well, if our consciousness is a microcosm</v>

392
00:17:24.125 --> 00:17:27.625
of the whole universe, the good news is that

393
00:17:27.625 --> 00:17:29.185
we're connected to the whole universe.

394
00:17:29.185 --> 00:17:32.195
The bad news is that we may, in a few eons ahead,

395
00:17:32.195 --> 00:17:33.585
they may not keep getting more

396
00:17:33.585 --> 00:17:36.485
and more conscious, but maybe that's not a bad thing.

397
00:17:36.485 --> 00:17:39.851
[Interviewer] Is there some space in there, somewhere,

398
00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:42.231
I don't mean that literally, but figuratively,

399
00:17:42.231 --> 00:17:43.923
is there space in this concept to look

400
00:17:43.923 --> 00:17:47.663
at the notion of super position in terms of

401
00:17:47.663 --> 00:17:51.903
actual dimensional, having dimensional values,

402
00:17:51.903 --> 00:17:55.764
of maybe existing in two dimensions at one time.

403
00:17:55.764 --> 00:17:57.624
Or two, or three, or four, or ten dimensions.

404
00:17:57.624 --> 00:18:01.324
Where does multidimensionality play into all this?

405
00:18:01.324 --> 00:18:04.363
<v ->Well, it depends on your interpretation of the</v>

406
00:18:04.363 --> 00:18:06.343
problem of collapse in the wave functions.

407
00:18:06.343 --> 00:18:08.823
If you believe in multiple worlds, then

408
00:18:08.823 --> 00:18:10.843
every super position branches off

409
00:18:10.843 --> 00:18:13.304
and forms a new universe.

410
00:18:13.304 --> 00:18:15.623
So, and that would presumably include your consciousness,

411
00:18:15.623 --> 00:18:18.303
so the, your consciousness that was gonna

412
00:18:18.303 --> 00:18:20.563
ask me a different question, is already in a different

413
00:18:20.563 --> 00:18:23.143
universe, where I'm trying to answer it.

414
00:18:23.143 --> 00:18:24.623
But in this universe, you asked me

415
00:18:24.623 --> 00:18:26.583
the question that you did, and we're discuss that.

416
00:18:26.583 --> 00:18:29.183
Now, and some people believe that.

417
00:18:29.183 --> 00:18:34.183
I don't follow that, because in the Penrose view,

418
00:18:34.323 --> 00:18:37.774
the super positions are unstable and will self collapse.

419
00:18:37.774 --> 00:18:40.794
So, because of that you chose to ask the question

420
00:18:40.794 --> 00:18:43.954
that you did, and the other possibility

421
00:18:43.954 --> 00:18:46.734
just kinda died away, you know,

422
00:18:46.734 --> 00:18:48.834
just the road not taken.

423
00:18:48.834 --> 00:18:51.234
You know I hear a lot of people talking

424
00:18:51.234 --> 00:18:54.294
about other dimensions and higher dimensions.

425
00:18:54.294 --> 00:18:56.494
I don't think you need that.

426
00:18:56.494 --> 00:18:58.234
I think if you want to look for

427
00:18:58.234 --> 00:19:02.994
deepness, and profound interconnection,

428
00:19:02.994 --> 00:19:07.534
and spirituality, it's in our universe,

429
00:19:07.534 --> 00:19:08.934
just at a different scale.

430
00:19:08.934 --> 00:19:10.374
It's at this fundamental scale.

431
00:19:10.374 --> 00:19:11.874
It's all the way down.

432
00:19:11.874 --> 00:19:13.834
Now, you might say, well, why would it,

433
00:19:13.834 --> 00:19:18.454
you know, spirituality it must be, you know, big, right?

434
00:19:18.454 --> 00:19:20.854
Well, the small scale is everywhere.

435
00:19:20.854 --> 00:19:22.614
Where ever you go, there it is.

436
00:19:22.614 --> 00:19:25.654
And not only that, it's as far as we can tell holographic.

437
00:19:25.654 --> 00:19:29.654
So that, you know, or fractal, even.

438
00:19:29.654 --> 00:19:34.194
So that big concepts exist at very sub sub

439
00:19:34.194 --> 00:19:37.033
microscobic concepts, so I would put

440
00:19:37.033 --> 00:19:39.932
spirituality not in another dimension,

441
00:19:39.932 --> 00:19:41.512
but at the, the fundamental level

442
00:19:41.512 --> 00:19:44.372
of our single, one and only dimension.

443
00:19:44.372 --> 00:19:46.132
Or four dimensions.

444
00:19:46.132 --> 00:19:48.372
[Interviewer] And also from, from some of what

445
00:19:48.372 --> 00:19:49.992
you've said before, it's not as though we have

446
00:19:49.992 --> 00:19:52.712
to go to other dimensions to find incredible

447
00:19:52.712 --> 00:19:55.793
possibilities in life as we understand it now.

448
00:19:55.793 --> 00:19:59.890
Um, so would you say is happening is going to lead us

449
00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:03.950
into a greater understand of, for example, of teleportation.

450
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:07.266
What's that all about? I mean, everybody's

451
00:20:07.266 --> 00:20:09.186
seen those shows.

452
00:20:09.186 --> 00:20:10.286
<v ->Beam me up , Scotty.</v>

453
00:20:10.286 --> 00:20:12.946
Well, they've actually done that now, with single particles.

454
00:20:12.946 --> 00:20:17.426
And, ah, it's used in, it destroys the one over here,

455
00:20:17.426 --> 00:20:18.847
but it recreates it over there.

456
00:20:18.847 --> 00:20:20.686
[Interviewer] So how can that functionally work?

457
00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:23.406
Is there a potential in the future that human beings

458
00:20:23.406 --> 00:20:25.966
or other matter, will be consciously teleported,

459
00:20:25.966 --> 00:20:28.146
or can consciously teleport itself,

460
00:20:28.146 --> 00:20:31.626
or does this come from an outside intention?

461
00:20:31.626 --> 00:20:34.646
Can you just talk about teleportation potentials a bit?

462
00:20:34.646 --> 00:20:37.286
<v ->Well, as I said, right now they</v>

463
00:20:37.286 --> 00:20:39.346
can do individual particles, like atoms

464
00:20:39.346 --> 00:20:40.846
and electron states, and so forth.

465
00:20:40.846 --> 00:20:42.606
It is unclear what would happen if you,

466
00:20:42.606 --> 00:20:45.726
if you teleported consciousness.

467
00:20:45.726 --> 00:20:48.666
Okay, I can see, you know the physical body,

468
00:20:48.666 --> 00:20:50.066
but when you teleport con--

469
00:20:50.066 --> 00:20:53.126
it's unclear whether the person created over there

470
00:20:53.126 --> 00:20:55.446
would be the same you as was over here.

471
00:20:55.446 --> 00:20:56.707
I don't know--

472
00:20:56.707 --> 00:20:58.126
[Interviewer] Physically, it could be?

473
00:20:58.126 --> 00:20:59.486
<v ->Physically, it could be, but would it be</v>

474
00:20:59.486 --> 00:21:00.986
the same consciousness?

475
00:21:00.986 --> 00:21:02.706
And, I don't know, on the other hand you could say

476
00:21:02.706 --> 00:21:04.266
well, we're not really the same, totally the same

477
00:21:04.266 --> 00:21:06.989
conscious from day to day, although we pretty much are.

478
00:21:06.989 --> 00:21:08.175
I don't think that's answerable yet.

479
00:21:08.175 --> 00:21:12.335
It's unclear whether, um, there's a problem

480
00:21:12.335 --> 00:21:14.855
called a no cloning theorem, that says you can't

481
00:21:14.855 --> 00:21:18.115
make exact copies and, ah,

482
00:21:18.115 --> 00:21:20.055
[Interviewer] Is that because the conscious permeating

483
00:21:20.055 --> 00:21:22.515
the copy is not the same, is what you're saying?

484
00:21:22.515 --> 00:21:24.855
Or does it have something to do with the mind,

485
00:21:24.855 --> 00:21:27.675
the greater mind that might be permeation that cloned copy

486
00:21:27.675 --> 00:21:30.493
is not the same, thus it's not the same?

487
00:21:30.493 --> 00:21:32.327
<v ->I can't even hazard a guess.</v>

488
00:21:32.327 --> 00:21:35.107
I did see an article about consciousness and teleportation

489
00:21:35.107 --> 00:21:38.187
on website called The Daily Grail, the other day.

490
00:21:38.187 --> 00:21:39.888
They actually interviewed me, and I noticed

491
00:21:39.888 --> 00:21:41.687
in looking at their website they had an article,

492
00:21:41.687 --> 00:21:44.368
Can Consciousness be Teleported?

493
00:21:44.368 --> 00:21:46.207
But I don't know what it says, I haven't read it yet.

494
00:21:46.207 --> 00:21:47.097
But I will.

495
00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:47.997
[Interviewer] In other words, you don't

496
00:21:47.997 --> 00:21:48.748
have your answer just yet?

497
00:21:48.748 --> 00:21:50.073
<v ->No, I don't.</v>

498
00:21:50.073 --> 00:21:51.486
[Interviewer] Another thing we might be

499
00:21:51.486 --> 00:21:53.467
looking at in the future is quantum computers.

500
00:21:53.467 --> 00:21:56.066
You made a quick reference to that earlier.

501
00:21:56.066 --> 00:21:59.026
What does the world of computing look like?

502
00:21:59.026 --> 00:22:00.587
How would that affect our world,

503
00:22:00.587 --> 00:22:03.666
how close, and where are we on that exploration?

504
00:22:03.666 --> 00:22:06.066
<v ->Well, we currently have a quantum cryptography</v>

505
00:22:06.066 --> 00:22:08.686
in commercial use, and that's used to send

506
00:22:08.686 --> 00:22:11.726
information, with absolute secrecy.

507
00:22:11.726 --> 00:22:13.567
Because it's like teleportation,

508
00:22:13.567 --> 00:22:16.826
you destroy a copy, you send it over here,

509
00:22:16.826 --> 00:22:19.106
and if anybody eaves drops, you can tell,

510
00:22:19.106 --> 00:22:20.166
there's a way to tell.

511
00:22:20.166 --> 00:22:22.686
So, it's, obviously the government

512
00:22:22.686 --> 00:22:24.926
and the military and banking code people

513
00:22:24.926 --> 00:22:26.126
are very interested in that, and it's

514
00:22:26.126 --> 00:22:27.366
actually in commercial use.

515
00:22:27.366 --> 00:22:29.286
[Interviewer] This is based on the notion of

516
00:22:29.286 --> 00:22:30.686
super position?

517
00:22:30.686 --> 00:22:32.766
<v ->And entanglement, right.</v>

518
00:22:32.766 --> 00:22:37.506
That you, ah, the, basically, basically

519
00:22:37.506 --> 00:22:39.846
the EPR experiment, which goes back,

520
00:22:39.846 --> 00:22:44.353
Einstein, Podlsky and Rosen, posed a

521
00:22:44.353 --> 00:22:47.053
thought experiment in the 1930's,

522
00:22:47.053 --> 00:22:50.613
that was intended to disprove the possibility

523
00:22:50.613 --> 00:22:52.153
that it eventually proved.

524
00:22:52.153 --> 00:22:53.833
And the thought experiment was basically

525
00:22:53.833 --> 00:22:56.493
if you have, say, two electrons,

526
00:22:56.493 --> 00:22:58.133
if one is spin up the other

527
00:22:58.133 --> 00:23:00.533
has to be spin down and vice versa.

528
00:23:00.533 --> 00:23:02.133
They're like little magnets.

529
00:23:02.133 --> 00:23:04.313
You can, now one of the electrons can be

530
00:23:04.313 --> 00:23:05.673
in super position of both up and down,

531
00:23:05.673 --> 00:23:07.253
and this one's both up and down, okay?

532
00:23:07.253 --> 00:23:09.473
But they're still entangled.

533
00:23:09.473 --> 00:23:13.293
You send one super position, you know,

534
00:23:13.293 --> 00:23:16.233
50 miles this way, and the other super position

535
00:23:16.233 --> 00:23:17.913
electron 50 miles this way.

536
00:23:17.913 --> 00:23:19.773
Then over here you make a measurement,

537
00:23:19.773 --> 00:23:24.573
and it collapses to up, then 100 miles away this one

538
00:23:24.573 --> 00:23:27.733
has to be down, or it is down, and that was

539
00:23:27.733 --> 00:23:28.793
the prediction.

540
00:23:28.793 --> 00:23:32.533
And, not only that, it would be instantaneous,

541
00:23:32.533 --> 00:23:35.293
and Einstein said, that's impossible,

542
00:23:35.293 --> 00:23:38.053
because nothing travels faster than the speed of light,

543
00:23:38.053 --> 00:23:40.853
according to special relativity.

544
00:23:40.853 --> 00:23:42.813
Well, in the 1980's the experiment was done,

545
00:23:42.813 --> 00:23:46.313
and sure enough, instantaneous entanglement.

546
00:23:46.313 --> 00:23:49.213
And, it's been done many, many times since then.

547
00:23:49.213 --> 00:23:51.221
It's the basis of quantum teleportation,

548
00:23:51.221 --> 00:23:53.681
and quantum cryptography and quantum computing.

549
00:23:53.681 --> 00:23:58.621
And larger, their now doing it with photons

550
00:23:58.621 --> 00:23:59.731
through fiber-optic cables off of satellites

551
00:23:59.731 --> 00:24:02.843
through the atmosphere and it works.

552
00:24:02.843 --> 00:24:05.263
[Interviewer] Can you give us some tangible examples

553
00:24:05.263 --> 00:24:07.463
of how this is being utilized in the real world, here,

554
00:24:07.463 --> 00:24:09.883
the third dimensional, everyday world?

555
00:24:09.883 --> 00:24:12.783
<v ->Um, to transmit information with absolute</v>

556
00:24:12.783 --> 00:24:16.882
secrecy and privacy in quantum cryptography,

557
00:24:16.882 --> 00:24:18.103
that's what it's called.

558
00:24:18.103 --> 00:24:20.303
Because if the code is broken, somebody eaves dropped

559
00:24:20.303 --> 00:24:24.543
it would alter the information, and, it could be detected.

560
00:24:24.543 --> 00:24:26.863
[Interviewer] Primarily military uses at this point in time?

561
00:24:26.863 --> 00:24:28.163
<v ->Ah, probably, yeah.</v>

562
00:24:28.163 --> 00:24:31.283
[Interviewer] How can you see quantum computing,

563
00:24:31.283 --> 00:24:35.113
perhaps, in the next step beyond this,

564
00:24:35.113 --> 00:24:36.923
toward a more popular type of use?

565
00:24:36.923 --> 00:24:38.866
<v ->Well, that's hard to say.</v>

566
00:24:38.866 --> 00:24:41.426
First they have to overcome the problem of decoherence

567
00:24:41.426 --> 00:24:43.765
because the quantum super positions seem to be

568
00:24:43.765 --> 00:24:48.606
very sensitive to environmental interaction.

569
00:24:48.606 --> 00:24:52.965
That's the other, ah, potential solution to

570
00:24:52.965 --> 00:24:54.606
the problem of collapse of the wave function.

571
00:24:54.606 --> 00:24:56.945
Super position gets eroded by interacting

572
00:24:56.945 --> 00:24:58.786
with the environment and decoheres,

573
00:24:58.786 --> 00:25:01.426
it loses it's coherence, so you've been asking

574
00:25:01.426 --> 00:25:03.466
about coherence and the idea is that the

575
00:25:03.466 --> 00:25:05.565
quantum state is incoherence, super position

576
00:25:05.565 --> 00:25:08.166
is coherence, but it loses that when it

577
00:25:08.166 --> 00:25:10.325
interacts with the classical environment.

578
00:25:10.325 --> 00:25:14.246
So to avoid that the quantum computers

579
00:25:14.246 --> 00:25:16.017
have to be built at extremely cold

580
00:25:16.017 --> 00:25:17.937
temperatures and isolated.

581
00:25:17.937 --> 00:25:19.417
And, by the way, that is used as an argument

582
00:25:19.417 --> 00:25:22.015
against the idea that quantum consciousness,

583
00:25:22.015 --> 00:25:24.035
quantum computation occurs in the brain.

584
00:25:24.035 --> 00:25:26.475
That's another story, which, if you want,

585
00:25:26.475 --> 00:25:30.215
I can try to explain, but um, quantum computers,

586
00:25:30.215 --> 00:25:32.035
if they can solve the problem of decoherence,

587
00:25:32.035 --> 00:25:35.715
have been show to exponentially faster, solve,

588
00:25:35.715 --> 00:25:38.715
factor large numbers into primes,

589
00:25:38.715 --> 00:25:40.555
which doesn't sound very exciting,

590
00:25:40.555 --> 00:25:42.835
except that's the basis for all codes.

591
00:25:42.835 --> 00:25:46.375
So again, military, financial, security is

592
00:25:46.375 --> 00:25:48.255
an immediate application.

593
00:25:48.255 --> 00:25:51.375
But they can also do exponentially faster searches.

594
00:25:51.375 --> 00:25:54.326
Now, Google's good, but quantum Google

595
00:25:54.326 --> 00:25:57.087
would be a lot better, apparently.

596
00:25:57.087 --> 00:26:00.607
And, the question for me is,

597
00:26:00.607 --> 00:26:03.687
well one question is

598
00:26:03.687 --> 00:26:04.995
would they be conscious, because we're arguing

599
00:26:04.995 --> 00:26:07.375
that quantum computing occurs in the brain.

600
00:26:07.375 --> 00:26:09.615
No, I don't think so because in

601
00:26:09.615 --> 00:26:13.675
technological quantum computers, the reduction

602
00:26:13.675 --> 00:26:15.775
occurs by somebody basically observing.

603
00:26:15.775 --> 00:26:17.655
Opening the box and looking, and that

604
00:26:17.655 --> 00:26:20.675
causes measurement or decoherence,

605
00:26:20.675 --> 00:26:23.195
which brings in some randomness, okay.

606
00:26:23.195 --> 00:26:26.055
But, you get around the randomness by

607
00:26:26.055 --> 00:26:28.935
doing the same computation many times and averaging it out.

608
00:26:28.935 --> 00:26:32.775
So, that doesn't spoil the benefit, but

609
00:26:32.775 --> 00:26:37.175
in consciousness, according to the Penrose approach,

610
00:26:37.175 --> 00:26:40.775
that I've followed him with, the collapse

611
00:26:40.775 --> 00:26:43.035
has to be a self collapse, because it has to

612
00:26:43.035 --> 00:26:45.755
reach this threshold so that it's is a process

613
00:26:45.755 --> 00:26:48.335
occurring in the fundamental level of space time geometry

614
00:26:48.335 --> 00:26:51.195
which is where the, not only the Platonic values,

615
00:26:51.195 --> 00:26:54.025
but the precursors of conscious experience,

616
00:26:54.025 --> 00:26:55.495
which are called qualia.

617
00:26:55.495 --> 00:26:56.922
Now, that's the other thing I didn't mention,

618
00:26:56.922 --> 00:26:59.962
we also think are embedded at the fundamental level.

619
00:26:59.962 --> 00:27:03.162
You could ask, how is consciousness produced,

620
00:27:03.162 --> 00:27:04.542
and there's basically two answers.

621
00:27:04.542 --> 00:27:07.082
One is that the brain does computation

622
00:27:07.082 --> 00:27:09.542
and that at high level of complex computations

623
00:27:09.542 --> 00:27:12.822
consciousness emerges, kinda like a weather pattern

624
00:27:12.822 --> 00:27:14.402
emerges form complex interactions

625
00:27:14.402 --> 00:27:16.160
among simple gas and dust molecules,

626
00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.915
or a candle flame emerges, or self organizing

627
00:27:18.915 --> 00:27:20.755
computer programs emerge.

628
00:27:20.755 --> 00:27:23.274
Some novel property emerging at a critical level

629
00:27:23.274 --> 00:27:26.494
of complexity in a higher archal system.

630
00:27:26.494 --> 00:27:30.733
And that's the preline view.

631
00:27:30.733 --> 00:27:33.343
[Interviewer] What's the other view?

632
00:27:33.343 --> 00:27:34.725
The other view would be our view,

633
00:27:34.725 --> 00:27:36.664
that it's a quantum computation.

634
00:27:36.664 --> 00:27:39.945
That to go from nonconscious to subconscious

635
00:27:39.945 --> 00:27:42.305
to consciousness involves a collapse,

636
00:27:42.305 --> 00:27:44.045
a particular type of collapse.

637
00:27:44.045 --> 00:27:45.805
that involves this self collapse,

638
00:27:45.805 --> 00:27:47.825
because the qualia, the experience,

639
00:27:47.825 --> 00:27:50.965
rather than being high order emergent phenomena

640
00:27:50.965 --> 00:27:53.505
are actually irreducible fundamental

641
00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:55.085
components of the universe.

642
00:27:55.085 --> 00:27:57.605
That at it's basic level the universe has

643
00:27:57.605 --> 00:28:01.745
the precursors of what philosophers call qualia,

644
00:28:01.745 --> 00:28:04.205
or the components of conscious experience.

645
00:28:04.205 --> 00:28:07.945
So, blueness, redness, the smell if a rose,

646
00:28:07.945 --> 00:28:10.565
things like that are examples of qualia

647
00:28:10.565 --> 00:28:12.885
that may be embedded at the fundamental level.

648
00:28:12.885 --> 00:28:13.975
Now--

649
00:28:13.975 --> 00:28:15.267
[Interviewer] This is more back to

650
00:28:15.267 --> 00:28:17.127
the Platonian explanation?

651
00:28:17.127 --> 00:28:20.797
<v ->Yeah, but in addition to the Platonic values,</v>

652
00:28:20.797 --> 00:28:23.369
the actual ingredients that go into

653
00:28:23.369 --> 00:28:26.749
the conscious experience, why we have feelings

654
00:28:26.749 --> 00:28:29.568
and emotions, are actually built into the universe.

655
00:28:29.568 --> 00:28:33.028
And the fact that our, the experience we have is complex,

656
00:28:33.028 --> 00:28:38.028
is kinda like, I liken it to a painter with a palate

657
00:28:38.028 --> 00:28:40.708
of primitive fundamental colors, a dab of this,

658
00:28:40.708 --> 00:28:43.348
a dab of that, and you have the Mona Lisa, or something.

659
00:28:43.348 --> 00:28:45.689
The brain comes on and takes a dab of redness,

660
00:28:45.689 --> 00:28:48.369
a dab of melancholy, a dab of this, a dab of that,

661
00:28:48.369 --> 00:28:50.349
and puts togeather complex feelings

662
00:28:50.349 --> 00:28:53.549
and conscious experience at any one moment.

663
00:28:53.549 --> 00:28:56.729
[Interviewer] And again, what is the, what is

664
00:28:56.729 --> 00:29:00.589
driving that experience, what is driving one person

665
00:29:00.589 --> 00:29:03.668
to be able to barely paint and daisy and

666
00:29:03.668 --> 00:29:05.849
the other one to paint a Mona Lisa?

667
00:29:05.849 --> 00:29:06.769
<v ->Well--</v>

668
00:29:06.769 --> 00:29:09.127
[Interviewer] Given this is the same palate?

669
00:29:09.127 --> 00:29:11.127
<v ->Um, nature and nurture.</v>

670
00:29:11.127 --> 00:29:14.646
It's like your all your upbringing, there may be

671
00:29:14.646 --> 00:29:18.146
genetic proclivities, there may be, how you were raised.

672
00:29:18.146 --> 00:29:22.287
There are all kinds of mundane, well not mundane,

673
00:29:22.287 --> 00:29:26.007
but not necessarily quantum or fundamental,

674
00:29:26.007 --> 00:29:28.606
things that go into how our brains work.

675
00:29:28.606 --> 00:29:30.067
And training, and this and that, and

676
00:29:30.067 --> 00:29:32.346
I'm not musical, I would like to be,

677
00:29:32.346 --> 00:29:36.447
but other people are because genes

678
00:29:36.447 --> 00:29:38.646
and how they were raised and their ears,

679
00:29:38.646 --> 00:29:39.706
and what have you.

680
00:29:39.706 --> 00:29:42.967
So, it's all, it's a combination of things.

681
00:29:42.967 --> 00:29:46.567
[Interviewer] Going back to quantum coherence

682
00:29:46.567 --> 00:29:50.506
and mind, and, I think, there's still a lot

683
00:29:50.506 --> 00:29:52.447
of mystery, isn't there, in the world of medicine,

684
00:29:52.447 --> 00:29:54.967
as to how the mind actually can function?

685
00:29:54.967 --> 00:29:57.250
<v ->Where does quantum coherence occur in the brain,</v>

686
00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:58.630
I think that's what your asking?

687
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:59.290
[Interviewer] Yes.

688
00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:03.230
<v ->Well, I would say microtubules.</v>

689
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:05.290
[Interviewer] Can you explain microtubules, just a bit?

690
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:07.850
In the simplest terms, and I know none

691
00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:09.870
of this is simple, what I'm asking a lot of you here.

692
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:12.468
<v ->Let me just tell it historically.</v>

693
00:30:12.468 --> 00:30:16.240
When I was in medical school, I did a reseach elective

694
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.360
in a cancer lab, and I was looking a cells dividing.

695
00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.300
And how the chromosomes are pulled apart

696
00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.920
to form daughter cells.

697
00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.140
And if they're not pulled apart precisely

698
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.860
in a mirror image. exactly equally,

699
00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:34.259
you can have malignancy, you can have cancer.

700
00:30:34.259 --> 00:30:36.280
So this has to be a very precise,

701
00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.060
choreographed ballet, if you will.

702
00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.380
And the structures that did this pulling apart

703
00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.770
were called mitotic spindles, and they

704
00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:46.742
were actually structures called microtubules.

705
00:30:46.742 --> 00:30:49.362
And it turns out that the same microtubles

706
00:30:49.362 --> 00:30:52.482
made up the skeleton of nerve cells.

707
00:30:52.482 --> 00:30:55.023
And actually, that was only discovered in the 70's.

708
00:30:55.023 --> 00:30:57.542
So, if you look inside nerve cells, just if you

709
00:30:57.542 --> 00:31:00.022
look inside our bodies, you see bones, okay, the skeleton.

710
00:31:00.022 --> 00:31:02.822
But the microtubles are not only structural support,

711
00:31:02.822 --> 00:31:04.663
but they're also the nervous system of the cell.

712
00:31:04.663 --> 00:31:06.983
They organize things, they specially and temporally

713
00:31:06.983 --> 00:31:08.923
organize things, they transport things, they seem

714
00:31:08.923 --> 00:31:09.883
to be the--

715
00:31:09.883 --> 00:31:10.762
[Interviewer] On-board computers?

716
00:31:10.762 --> 00:31:12.492
<v ->The on-board computers of the cell, exactly.</v>

717
00:31:12.492 --> 00:31:17.163
And they're structure is like a hallow ear of corn, okay,

718
00:31:17.163 --> 00:31:19.763
with little kernels and the kernels actually

719
00:31:19.763 --> 00:31:21.403
can be like little bit states, if you will.

720
00:31:21.403 --> 00:31:25.003
And they are in a very interesting geometry,

721
00:31:25.003 --> 00:31:29.323
and the bits states, kernels, they actually

722
00:31:29.323 --> 00:31:31.364
look like peanuts, because they change shape,

723
00:31:31.364 --> 00:31:33.223
can communicate with their neighbors and

724
00:31:33.223 --> 00:31:36.443
they can process information in what's called

725
00:31:36.443 --> 00:31:38.213
cellular automata function.

726
00:31:38.213 --> 00:31:40.531
So, basically, you have this, another level

727
00:31:40.531 --> 00:31:43.591
of information processing within each cell.

728
00:31:43.591 --> 00:31:46.751
Now, most views of the brain are that the brain is

729
00:31:46.751 --> 00:31:49.531
100 billion nerve cells, where the nerve cells are

730
00:31:49.531 --> 00:31:52.331
the fundamental units, talking to other fundamental units.

731
00:31:52.331 --> 00:31:55.231
But each nerve cell is far more than a fundamental unit.

732
00:31:55.231 --> 00:31:57.431
Each nerve cell is incredibly complicated.

733
00:31:57.431 --> 00:32:00.771
If you think of a cell like a paramecia, you know,

734
00:32:00.771 --> 00:32:03.431
like a little protozoa, it swims around, it bumps into

735
00:32:03.431 --> 00:32:06.211
something moves away, it swims over here, finds food,

736
00:32:06.211 --> 00:32:09.171
it avoids predators, it finds a mate, it has sex,

737
00:32:09.171 --> 00:32:11.311
it doesn't have any synapses, it's one cell.

738
00:32:11.311 --> 00:32:14.152
It uses it's microtubles inside it's skeleton

739
00:32:14.152 --> 00:32:16.571
as information processing to do all these things.

740
00:32:16.571 --> 00:32:19.865
So, I got on to the idea in the late 70's

741
00:32:19.865 --> 00:32:23.085
and throughout the 80's, that microtubles,

742
00:32:23.085 --> 00:32:26.425
inside neurons were processing information

743
00:32:26.425 --> 00:32:28.745
necessary for consciousness and that

744
00:32:28.745 --> 00:32:30.714
if you went down just to the level

745
00:32:30.714 --> 00:32:32.214
of neurons and synapses,

746
00:32:32.214 --> 00:32:33.584
that wouldn't do it, you had to

747
00:32:33.584 --> 00:32:35.445
go down to the level of micrtotubles.

748
00:32:35.445 --> 00:32:38.045
And that increased the information capacity

749
00:32:38.045 --> 00:32:40.224
of the brain enormously.

750
00:32:40.224 --> 00:32:44.224
And this displeased A..I people

751
00:32:44.224 --> 00:32:48.406
because they were trying emulate, to build

752
00:32:48.406 --> 00:32:50.445
computers equal to the brain based on neurons being

753
00:32:50.445 --> 00:32:54.115
the fundamental units.

754
00:32:54.115 --> 00:32:57.353
But, in any case, somebody once said to me,

755
00:32:57.353 --> 00:32:59.247
well, okay, say you're right, each neuron

756
00:32:59.247 --> 00:33:01.822
is like a whole little brain, how is that

757
00:33:01.822 --> 00:33:03.876
going to explain feelings and emotions and so forth.

758
00:33:03.876 --> 00:33:05.576
And I had to admit that they were right.

759
00:33:05.576 --> 00:33:07.077
I didn't really have a good answer for that.

760
00:33:07.077 --> 00:33:09.156
And that's when I read Roger's book about

761
00:33:09.156 --> 00:33:11.497
quantum computing and I thought he might

762
00:33:11.497 --> 00:33:14.497
have the mechanism, but I had the structure.

763
00:33:14.497 --> 00:33:18.596
That microtubles were the quantum computing devices,

764
00:33:18.596 --> 00:33:21.776
and that quantum coherence among the microtubles

765
00:33:21.776 --> 00:33:23.869
throughout neurons in the brain

766
00:33:23.869 --> 00:33:27.459
were necessary for consciousness.

767
00:33:27.459 --> 00:33:28.355
[Interviewer] And consciousness is,

768
00:33:28.355 --> 00:33:31.315
folded into consciousness is feeling, etcetera?

769
00:33:31.315 --> 00:33:34.055
<v ->Feelings would be, yeah when the quantum computations</v>

770
00:33:34.055 --> 00:33:37.755
access the fundamental level, where they,

771
00:33:37.755 --> 00:33:39.395
where the protoconscious qualia are,

772
00:33:39.395 --> 00:33:40.735
that's where the feelings come in.

773
00:33:40.735 --> 00:33:43.235
Because otherwise, it's just computations.

774
00:33:43.235 --> 00:33:47.315
I think to account for feelings, and qualia,

775
00:33:47.315 --> 00:33:51.015
emotions you have to go down to that fundamental level.

776
00:33:51.015 --> 00:33:55.935
[Interviewer] So how does What the Bleep, the movie that

777
00:33:55.935 --> 00:33:58.855
I think an awful lot of people will recognize

778
00:33:58.855 --> 00:34:01.855
you from that movie and it's doing astoundingly well.

779
00:34:01.855 --> 00:34:05.615
I think it's setting the stage for a lot of consciousness

780
00:34:05.615 --> 00:34:07.455
based movies in the future.

781
00:34:07.455 --> 00:34:09.831
That took a very basic story of self image, emotions

782
00:34:09.831 --> 00:34:12.111
and self image into account.

783
00:34:12.111 --> 00:34:14.971
From your perspective, what is the practical

784
00:34:14.971 --> 00:34:19.971
application to having some understanding of

785
00:34:20.071 --> 00:34:22.951
quantum theory or the quantum world?

786
00:34:22.951 --> 00:34:25.211
What does it mean in everyday term for us?

787
00:34:25.211 --> 00:34:28.791
<v ->Well, it's funny, everybody gets something different</v>

788
00:34:28.791 --> 00:34:30.831
out of that movie--

789
00:34:30.831 --> 00:34:32.451
[Interviewer] What did you get out of the movie,

790
00:34:32.451 --> 00:34:33.251
first of all?

791
00:34:33.251 --> 00:34:34.491
What did you think it was saying

792
00:34:34.491 --> 00:34:36.931
after you saw all of you put together, a collage of sorts?

793
00:34:36.931 --> 00:34:41.431
<v ->I was, I thought, they started out</v>

794
00:34:41.431 --> 00:34:43.291
talking about quantum physics and then digressed

795
00:34:43.291 --> 00:34:45.291
into other stuff, which was interesting.

796
00:34:45.291 --> 00:34:48.751
But they didn't really develop the quantum business, fully.

797
00:34:48.751 --> 00:34:50.451
They mentioned it, and they talked about it,

798
00:34:50.451 --> 00:34:53.011
and, ah, but, I think otherwise it would have

799
00:34:53.011 --> 00:34:55.011
been too much for people to handle.

800
00:34:55.011 --> 00:34:58.071
So instead, they brought in all these other things.

801
00:34:58.071 --> 00:35:00.411
But one of the things about quantum physics,

802
00:35:00.411 --> 00:35:02.411
according to Copenhagen interpretation

803
00:35:02.411 --> 00:35:05.091
is that you create reality, you create your reality.

804
00:35:05.091 --> 00:35:08.231
Joe Dispenza talking about waking up in the morning

805
00:35:08.231 --> 00:35:10.471
and planning your day, that's another level.

806
00:35:10.471 --> 00:35:13.391
So it's kinda a higher level.

807
00:35:13.391 --> 00:35:15.882
The power of positive thinking is the same thing.

808
00:35:15.882 --> 00:35:18.403
That just thinking can create reality.

809
00:35:18.403 --> 00:35:19.543
So I think that was at least one

810
00:35:19.543 --> 00:35:21.263
of the take home messages in the film,

811
00:35:21.263 --> 00:35:25.323
But as far as how I could, this came up in the talk today,

812
00:35:25.323 --> 00:35:27.242
and, ah, what did I say?

813
00:35:27.242 --> 00:35:29.942
[Interviewer] You said there were basically three things--

814
00:35:29.942 --> 00:35:30.483
<v ->Three things.</v>

815
00:35:30.483 --> 00:35:32.523
[Interviewer] that come out of this.

816
00:35:32.523 --> 00:35:34.983
<v ->One was, because I think the microtubles</v>

817
00:35:34.983 --> 00:35:37.823
are the key to consciousness, is take care of your tubules.

818
00:35:37.823 --> 00:35:40.322
[Interviewer] How do we take care of our tubules?

819
00:35:40.322 --> 00:35:43.062
<v ->Well, Alzheimer's disease is basically</v>

820
00:35:43.062 --> 00:35:44.843
a disease of microtubules.

821
00:35:44.843 --> 00:35:47.762
They're call neurofibular entangles in neurons,

822
00:35:47.762 --> 00:35:49.482
cause Alzheimer's disease.

823
00:35:49.482 --> 00:35:52.843
There's no specific way, other than the usual things,

824
00:35:52.843 --> 00:35:55.943
good diet, exercise, nutrition, that sort of thing.

825
00:35:55.943 --> 00:35:59.582
So that's kind of a no brainer.

826
00:35:59.582 --> 00:36:02.003
[Interviewer] Fundamental

827
00:36:02.003 --> 00:36:03.342
<v ->Yeah.</v>

828
00:36:03.342 --> 00:36:06.343
The other one was live in moment.

829
00:36:06.343 --> 00:36:07.743
[Interviewer] Why is that?

830
00:36:07.743 --> 00:36:11.943
<v ->Cause, in this view, consciousness</v>

831
00:36:11.943 --> 00:36:14.043
is a sequence of events.

832
00:36:14.043 --> 00:36:15.443
Each one is now.

833
00:36:15.443 --> 00:36:17.723
Much like the philosopher, Alfred North Whitehead

834
00:36:17.723 --> 00:36:20.263
who said consciousness is a sequence of occasions

835
00:36:20.263 --> 00:36:22.663
of experience occurring in a wider field

836
00:36:22.663 --> 00:36:24.103
of protoconscious experience.

837
00:36:24.103 --> 00:36:25.623
We're saying the same thing.

838
00:36:25.623 --> 00:36:27.923
The sequence of quantum state reductions

839
00:36:27.923 --> 00:36:30.613
occurring in a protoconscious,fundamental,

840
00:36:30.613 --> 00:36:32.273
Planck scale level.

841
00:36:32.273 --> 00:36:35.113
But all that exists is the now.

842
00:36:35.113 --> 00:36:38.633
[interviewer] To make the now count.

843
00:36:38.633 --> 00:36:39.793
To make in conscious?

844
00:36:39.793 --> 00:36:40.693
<v ->Enjoy the moment, yeah.</v>

845
00:36:40.693 --> 00:36:42.973
And don't obsess about the past or the future.

846
00:36:42.973 --> 00:36:46.753
I made that mistake, just worry so much about

847
00:36:46.753 --> 00:36:48.993
things that happened or things that could happen

848
00:36:48.993 --> 00:36:50.553
or will or won't happen that I just forget

849
00:36:50.553 --> 00:36:52.733
that hey, I should be having a good time right now.

850
00:36:52.733 --> 00:36:54.373
[Interviewer] So, live in the now,

851
00:36:54.373 --> 00:36:56.893
take care of your microtubules, live in the now.

852
00:36:56.893 --> 00:36:58.273
What's number three?

853
00:36:58.273 --> 00:37:02.613
<v ->Oh, be, allow yourself to be</v>

854
00:37:02.613 --> 00:37:05.133
influenced by the Platonic influences,

855
00:37:05.133 --> 00:37:07.073
the Platonic information.

856
00:37:07.073 --> 00:37:08.893
Whether you wanna call it subtle energies,

857
00:37:08.893 --> 00:37:10.853
or whatever you want to call it.

858
00:37:10.853 --> 00:37:11.878
[Interviewer] Guiding intelligence?

859
00:37:11.878 --> 00:37:14.724
<v ->The way of Doa, may the force be with you,</v>

860
00:37:14.724 --> 00:37:16.424
devine intervention, whatever you want to call it.

861
00:37:16.424 --> 00:37:18.904
I think that it has a physical basis,

862
00:37:18.904 --> 00:37:22.024
in the fundamental level of the universe.

863
00:37:22.024 --> 00:37:26.665
But if you're so focused on one particular goal,

864
00:37:26.665 --> 00:37:30.684
and operate purely algorithmically,

865
00:37:30.684 --> 00:37:33.645
without pausing and being mindful and reflective,

866
00:37:33.645 --> 00:37:36.725
and allowing intuition or instinct to come into play,

867
00:37:36.725 --> 00:37:39.545
you'll miss out on a lot of the potential

868
00:37:39.545 --> 00:37:42.465
guiding influences, if you will.

869
00:37:42.465 --> 00:37:44.685
[Interviewer] That was beautiful.

870
00:37:44.685 --> 00:37:47.335
One last question, I know you have

871
00:37:47.335 --> 00:37:49.285
to go back to Tuscon in a bit here.

872
00:37:49.285 --> 00:37:53.445
How does the state, going back to where we started.

873
00:37:53.445 --> 00:37:56.525
How does the dream state play into all of this?

874
00:37:56.525 --> 00:38:00.225
I've read on numerous occasions,

875
00:38:00.225 --> 00:38:02.685
people throughout history that have made their

876
00:38:02.685 --> 00:38:04.245
big breakthroughs and have this

877
00:38:04.245 --> 00:38:05.965
come to them in a dream state.

878
00:38:05.965 --> 00:38:07.725
<v ->Right, I mentioned in the talk today</v>

879
00:38:07.725 --> 00:38:11.445
that Kekule discovered the structure Benzene in a dream.

880
00:38:11.445 --> 00:38:16.385
I think that dreams and other manifestations

881
00:38:16.385 --> 00:38:19.065
of the subconscious, including what comes out

882
00:38:19.065 --> 00:38:21.845
in art and artistic expression and so forth,

883
00:38:21.845 --> 00:38:24.405
are more in the quantum world.

884
00:38:24.405 --> 00:38:27.585
And the consciousness is the conversion

885
00:38:27.585 --> 00:38:29.585
of the quantum world into the classical world.

886
00:38:29.585 --> 00:38:31.045
It exists on the edge.

887
00:38:31.045 --> 00:38:35.045
I think the amount of information in the quantum world,

888
00:38:35.045 --> 00:38:37.965
and the logic in the quantum world, which is very much

889
00:38:37.965 --> 00:38:41.485
like quantum logic, by the way, is vast.

890
00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:45.265
And that if we can avail ourselves to that we can

891
00:38:45.265 --> 00:38:49.245
be more wise and have great insight.

892
00:38:49.245 --> 00:38:52.005
You know, certain altered states, I think,

893
00:38:52.005 --> 00:38:55.545
actually push the boundary one way or another.

894
00:38:55.545 --> 00:38:57.485
And there are old studies, for example, that psychedelic

895
00:38:57.485 --> 00:39:00.125
drugs promote quantum states in their receptors.

896
00:39:00.125 --> 00:39:02.505
So that in the psychedelic experience it may be that

897
00:39:02.505 --> 00:39:06.025
the brain is more in a, the mind is more in a

898
00:39:06.025 --> 00:39:08.665
quantum state, more in a dream-like state,

899
00:39:08.665 --> 00:39:11.685
which includes multiple coexisting possibilities,

900
00:39:11.685 --> 00:39:15.985
deep inner connections, timelessness, all of which

901
00:39:15.985 --> 00:39:17.585
are characteristics of the quantum world.

902
00:39:17.585 --> 00:39:19.225
[Interviewer] The physical world may appear different,

903
00:39:19.225 --> 00:39:21.685
the colors may appear differently, for example.

904
00:39:21.685 --> 00:39:24.325
All of that, your saying, all of these senses

905
00:39:24.325 --> 00:39:26.785
are expanded beyond?

906
00:39:26.785 --> 00:39:29.225
<v ->Yeah, there's that and there is also</v>

907
00:39:29.225 --> 00:39:31.585
the fact that you're having more conscious moments

908
00:39:31.585 --> 00:39:34.645
per time, per clock time, and they're of greater intensity.

909
00:39:34.645 --> 00:39:37.665
So your having more conscious moments,

910
00:39:37.665 --> 00:39:40.205
they're greater intensity but your more

911
00:39:40.205 --> 00:39:42.695
in the quantum subonscious,

912
00:39:42.695 --> 00:39:45.482
which has, kind of a treasure trove of

913
00:39:45.482 --> 00:39:48.242
information and it's arranged differently.

914
00:39:48.242 --> 00:39:50.702
As I said, deep inner connection,

915
00:39:50.702 --> 00:39:53.212
multiple coexisting possibilities.

916
00:39:53.212 --> 00:39:56.202
A psychologist named Ignacio Matte Blanco

917
00:39:56.202 --> 00:39:59.422
analyzed the logic of dreams, actually in the 70's,

918
00:39:59.422 --> 00:40:03.283
and the logic that he found in the 30 years of study,

919
00:40:03.283 --> 00:40:05.062
the logic that came out of people's dreams

920
00:40:05.062 --> 00:40:08.862
is very much like the logic we see in quantum theory.

921
00:40:08.862 --> 00:40:13.662
So, um, I think the subconscious is

922
00:40:13.662 --> 00:40:15.622
in the quantum world, and the

923
00:40:15.622 --> 00:40:18.602
transition from the quantum world to

924
00:40:18.602 --> 00:40:22.082
the classical world is consciousness, which is very

925
00:40:22.082 --> 00:40:24.742
much like something in the Kabbalah.

926
00:40:24.742 --> 00:40:28.882
And the Kabbalah talks about two worlds,

927
00:40:28.882 --> 00:40:32.962
a one percent world of kinda, aggravation,

928
00:40:32.962 --> 00:40:36.423
and a 99 percent world of wisdom and light.

929
00:40:36.423 --> 00:40:38.502
Now you'd think it should be the other way around.

930
00:40:38.502 --> 00:40:40.902
The 99, if I'm likening the wisdom and light

931
00:40:40.902 --> 00:40:42.902
to the quantum world, and the one percent world

932
00:40:42.902 --> 00:40:44.383
to the classical world, which is larger.

933
00:40:44.383 --> 00:40:47.122
but the amount of information is so vast,

934
00:40:47.122 --> 00:40:50.402
I think the 99 percent world is the world of

935
00:40:50.402 --> 00:40:51.942
wisdom and light and the Kabbalah says

936
00:40:51.942 --> 00:40:53.902
that the consciousness dances on the edge

937
00:40:53.902 --> 00:40:56.542
of the two worlds and I think that fits perfectly

938
00:40:56.542 --> 00:40:57.823
with the--

939
00:40:57.823 --> 00:40:59.262
[Interviewer] Ancient wisdom coming

940
00:40:59.262 --> 00:41:03.702
around into basically being scientifically validated today.

941
00:41:03.702 --> 00:41:06.665
<v ->I hope they will be scientifically validated,</v>

942
00:41:06.665 --> 00:41:08.385
cause that's a very nice thought.

943
00:41:08.385 --> 00:41:09.805
[Interviewer] Sounds like you're doing your part.

944
00:41:09.805 --> 00:41:10.965
Thank you so much.

945
00:41:10.965 --> 00:41:13.475
<v ->Thank you.</v>

946
00:41:13.475 --> 00:41:15.285
<v ->Once you've watched this interview,</v>

947
00:41:15.285 --> 00:41:16.925
you'll want to see Vernon Wolf.

948
00:41:16.925 --> 00:41:19.185
At a recent What the Bleep conference,

949
00:41:19.185 --> 00:41:21.965
the physist, Dr. Fred Wolf told the attendees

950
00:41:21.965 --> 00:41:24.303
that if you want to know how to put all this What the Bleep

951
00:41:24.303 --> 00:41:26.863
information into motion, go see Vernon.

952
00:41:26.863 --> 00:41:30.663
Until next time, thanks for watching.

953
00:41:30.663 --> 00:41:35.663
