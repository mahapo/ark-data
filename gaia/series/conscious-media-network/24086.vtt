1
00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:03.331
<v ->Sound offers perhaps some of the</v>

2
00:00:03.331 --> 00:00:06.702
greatest potential in the field of health and healing.

3
00:00:06.702 --> 00:00:08.022
Sound was said to have been used

4
00:00:08.022 --> 00:00:10.362
in the ancient healing chambers of Egypt.

5
00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:12.582
It has been proven to improve mental acuity

6
00:00:12.582 --> 00:00:14.202
and help relieve depression and

7
00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:16.302
much more in clinical studies.

8
00:00:16.302 --> 00:00:17.422
And the man who has been at the

9
00:00:17.422 --> 00:00:19.762
center of this emerging art and science

10
00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:23.022
for the past 25 years is Jonathan Goldman,

11
00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:28.022
who says we all carry this instrument of healing with us.

12
00:00:29.182 --> 00:00:31.342
<v Voiceover>And first there was the word,</v>

13
00:00:31.342 --> 00:00:35.862
and nobody knows this any better than you. (laughs)

14
00:00:35.862 --> 00:00:38.302
<v ->In the beginning.</v>

15
00:00:38.302 --> 00:00:39.202
<v Voiceover>(laughs) So you have</v>

16
00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:40.542
had an incredible career in the area of

17
00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:43.542
sound healing; I've seen your work,

18
00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:46.322
and heard your CD's, and known

19
00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:50.322
bits and pieces about your work for many years now.

20
00:00:50.322 --> 00:00:53.662
Incredible, and, really, I think people

21
00:00:53.662 --> 00:00:56.402
don't understand what sound actually is.

22
00:00:56.402 --> 00:00:57.662
Can you give us a little primer of

23
00:00:57.662 --> 00:01:00.442
the essence of what sound is and

24
00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:02.242
the things throughout history that

25
00:01:02.242 --> 00:01:05.182
it's actually known to have done?

26
00:01:05.182 --> 00:01:07.642
<v ->Golly, gee, how many hours do we have?</v>

27
00:01:07.642 --> 00:01:10.742
<v Voiceover>We have about, oh, 20, 30 minutes. (laughs)</v>

28
00:01:10.742 --> 00:01:15.742
<v ->Real quick, from one perspective, sound travels as a wave.</v>

29
00:01:16.102 --> 00:01:20.562
This wave is a way of measuring the sounds

30
00:01:20.562 --> 00:01:24.402
so that we hear from around 20 of these waves

31
00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:28.622
that happen per second to about 20,000.

32
00:01:28.622 --> 00:01:32.481
But, as I like to tell people, our friends

33
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:34.821
in the ocean, the dolphins, can hear

34
00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:38.481
up to 180,000 of these waves per second,

35
00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:40.101
which to us there's nothing going on,

36
00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:41.901
yet to them, they're able to probably

37
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:45.261
exchange encyclopedic information

38
00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:48.041
and so therefore, the concept is that

39
00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:51.581
what the ancients have known about,

40
00:01:51.581 --> 00:01:53.161
that of course a modern scientists

41
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:55.661
are now understanding the ancients would say,

42
00:01:55.661 --> 00:01:57.361
"Not a brah-min, in the beginning was

43
00:01:57.361 --> 00:01:59.621
the word, the world is sound, and now

44
00:01:59.621 --> 00:02:04.621
as Mi-shu Caw-koo said to me, "Everything is music."

45
00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:06.421
So this idea that everything is

46
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:08.941
in a state of vibration, and the

47
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:11.841
concept of using sound as a healing and transformative

48
00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:15.601
modality is as old as probably

49
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:19.601
the first time the cavemen ever made a sound,

50
00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:23.931
when he stubbed his toe, and, you know, made a tone,

51
00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:27.371
and that helped somehow release some of the pain,

52
00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:29.531
it may go back that far, and then his

53
00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:31.571
clansmen might have been clacking stones

54
00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:35.631
together and making sounds to ask

55
00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:39.851
for the rain gods to come and water

56
00:02:39.851 --> 00:02:41.651
them or whatnot, but et cetera.

57
00:02:41.651 --> 00:02:43.851
We've gotten a bit more sophisticated,

58
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:46.531
but I still clack stones from time to time.

59
00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:48.011
<v Voiceover>Right, and, in truth,</v>

60
00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:50.211
the ancients were quite sophisticated,

61
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:51.471
the ancient cultures understood

62
00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:54.511
sound far better than we can begin to comprehend

63
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:55.751
yet because we haven't caught up

64
00:02:55.751 --> 00:02:58.071
to where we were; we haven't gone back to the future yet.

65
00:02:58.071 --> 00:02:59.311
<v ->Right, exactly, and the ancient</v>

66
00:02:59.311 --> 00:03:03.511
mystery schools of Athens, Rome, you know, Tibet,

67
00:03:03.511 --> 00:03:05.271
Egypt, and whatnot - they understood

68
00:03:05.271 --> 00:03:08.171
that sound was the basic primordial

69
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:10.711
causative force in the universe.

70
00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:13.191
Once again, the word, "and the Lord said,"

71
00:03:13.191 --> 00:03:15.291
all the different traditions talk

72
00:03:15.291 --> 00:03:19.791
about sound being the manifestation point,

73
00:03:19.791 --> 00:03:22.691
and we're beginning, slowly, to understand this.

74
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:23.711
<v Voiceover>What are some of the</v>

75
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:26.271
phenomena of the past; I mean, I'm

76
00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:28.711
thinking of things such as the ability to

77
00:03:28.711 --> 00:03:31.271
levitate items that are recounted

78
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:33.851
from glory days of the past or

79
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:36.531
golden ages of the past, what is

80
00:03:36.531 --> 00:03:39.331
sound credited for, just kind of a little list of

81
00:03:39.331 --> 00:03:41.691
some of the things sound has been credited with,

82
00:03:41.691 --> 00:03:44.611
that we consider actually magical or phenomenal?

83
00:03:44.611 --> 00:03:46.931
<v ->Well, we could say that on a level,</v>

84
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:49.091
in the different traditions, sound

85
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:53.291
is credited for life, the universe, and everything,

86
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:55.711
from the creation of the planets,

87
00:03:55.711 --> 00:03:58.071
to the creation of human beings.

88
00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.131
In the different traditions, an

89
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:02.011
inanimate object would be created

90
00:04:02.011 --> 00:04:04.491
from clay, for example; certain

91
00:04:04.491 --> 00:04:06.791
sacred words would be spoken over it,

92
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:07.851
and all of a sudden the inanimate

93
00:04:07.851 --> 00:04:12.851
object would become real and be given life.

94
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:14.471
And as you mentioned, levitation,

95
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:15.991
and of course, as I quote from the

96
00:04:15.991 --> 00:04:20.951
New York Times, 1988, science section,

97
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:24.011
February 8th, 1988, just so you know

98
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:25.951
it didn't come from UFO Daily -

99
00:04:25.951 --> 00:04:28.791
sound shaped into dazzling tool

100
00:04:28.791 --> 00:04:31.751
can make, break, or rearrange molecular structure,

101
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:34.652
and levitate objects, so once again,

102
00:04:34.652 --> 00:04:37.772
you know, if you remember building the pyramids was sound.

103
00:04:37.772 --> 00:04:40.851
You're not alone.
<v Voiceover>Exactly, (laughs), that's right.</v>

104
00:04:40.851 --> 00:04:44.191
Well that's kind of what I was referring to.

105
00:04:44.191 --> 00:04:47.131
Now you're bringing sound into the realm of healing;

106
00:04:47.131 --> 00:04:52.011
healing not just people but cultures and society.

107
00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:53.651
Let's just launch off wherever

108
00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:55.332
you're most comfortable on that one.

109
00:04:55.332 --> 00:04:57.711
Where are you really focusing right now?

110
00:04:57.711 --> 00:05:00.631
<v ->World healing, but really, it's basically</v>

111
00:05:00.631 --> 00:05:03.891
creating harmony throughout the planet

112
00:05:03.891 --> 00:05:06.911
using sound, intentionalized sound.

113
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:09.791
My first book, "Healing Sounds",

114
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:12.811
I created a formula called "frequency"

115
00:05:12.811 --> 00:05:15.991
which was the sound plus intent equals healing,

116
00:05:15.991 --> 00:05:17.751
and of course, healing was the outcome

117
00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:20.072
because the book was called "Healing Sounds",

118
00:05:20.072 --> 00:05:22.452
but if you wanted, say, peace, or harmony,

119
00:05:22.452 --> 00:05:25.551
it's frequency plus intent equals whatever you want

120
00:05:25.551 --> 00:05:30.452
and right now, I am very very much,

121
00:05:30.452 --> 00:05:32.671
my passion if you like, is helping

122
00:05:32.671 --> 00:05:37.231
unify and unite the world through sound,

123
00:05:37.231 --> 00:05:40.751
which may sound a little grandiose, but really it's not.

124
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:42.051
<v Voiceover>A worthy goal.</v>

125
00:05:42.051 --> 00:05:43.192
<v ->It's a worthy goal and you get</v>

126
00:05:43.192 --> 00:05:46.271
a group of people together who don't know each other,

127
00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:49.871
and they begin to even just make an "ah" sound together,

128
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:53.671
and all of a sudden there is the interconnecting force.

129
00:05:53.671 --> 00:05:54.991
Recently my wife Andy and I

130
00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:57.131
wrote this book called "Tantra of Sound",

131
00:05:57.131 --> 00:05:59.931
and we used tantra in the traditional term which means

132
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:03.591
the interconnecting, like, web that unites reality.

133
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:06.832
And the book is about how to use sound,

134
00:06:06.832 --> 00:06:08.911
to basically connect deeper within yourself

135
00:06:08.911 --> 00:06:12.311
and with others, and it's just extraordinary

136
00:06:12.311 --> 00:06:14.871
how you can get a group of strangers

137
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:16.371
who make sound together, and all of

138
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:18.572
a sudden you realize, the ancient Mayan

139
00:06:18.572 --> 00:06:22.231
In Lak'ech Ala K'in - I am you, you are me.

140
00:06:22.231 --> 00:06:25.751
And it's so important, so my great passion

141
00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:28.111
right now is to see what we can do about

142
00:06:28.111 --> 00:06:31.251
changing the majority of consciousness

143
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:35.332
on this planet so that our children's children's children

144
00:06:35.332 --> 00:06:39.311
have a better existence than is

145
00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:44.031
currently seeming to be manifested.
<v Voiceover>And it seems that sound</v>

146
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:45.591
is going to be a big part of that healing process.

147
00:06:45.591 --> 00:06:47.311
Anybody that's ever sat in a group

148
00:06:47.311 --> 00:06:49.771
like you say, and even done an "ohm" or an "ah"

149
00:06:49.771 --> 00:06:52.692
together, it is astounding how quickly

150
00:06:52.692 --> 00:06:56.431
you can't even discern your own voice from others',

151
00:06:56.431 --> 00:06:59.231
because it becomes unified, it becomes

152
00:06:59.231 --> 00:07:01.351
one vibration moving through everybody.

153
00:07:01.351 --> 00:07:05.151
I find it an absolutely amazing experience

154
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:08.931
to participate in, and so using that on a,

155
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:11.131
this is something I've wanted to talk

156
00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:13.311
to you about for years, which is

157
00:07:13.311 --> 00:07:17.111
family dynamics - you have Dad,

158
00:07:17.111 --> 00:07:21.871
who might be stuck in this glory days of Jimmy Buffett,

159
00:07:21.871 --> 00:07:23.991
you've got the kid--
<v ->Or Jimi Hendrix.</v>

160
00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:26.611
<v ->Or Jimi Hendrix, and you've got the kid,</v>

161
00:07:26.611 --> 00:07:30.571
who is into whatever might be irritating Dad the most,

162
00:07:30.571 --> 00:07:32.311
maybe he's into some particular

163
00:07:32.311 --> 00:07:34.231
form of rap that's irritating to Dad,

164
00:07:34.231 --> 00:07:36.271
doesn't like the rhythms or whatnot,

165
00:07:36.271 --> 00:07:37.871
and then you have Mom who can't

166
00:07:37.871 --> 00:07:39.771
stand any of it, just give her a little

167
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:42.251
bit of New Age and some angelic sounds,

168
00:07:42.251 --> 00:07:47.251
how do families function in this disharmonic environment?

169
00:07:49.531 --> 00:07:51.551
Can you talk for a while about this,

170
00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:53.131
and how we can heal this besides

171
00:07:53.131 --> 00:07:55.511
iPods and everyone having their own headset?

172
00:07:55.511 --> 00:07:57.371
<v ->Right, and I will acknowledge that</v>

173
00:07:57.371 --> 00:08:00.381
my son and I have very, very similar

174
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:03.601
tastes, so that we both like Jimi Hendrix

175
00:08:03.601 --> 00:08:05.681
or the Beatles or whatnot, and my

176
00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:08.481
wife and I through the Beatles,

177
00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:11.301
had a great resonance together,

178
00:08:11.301 --> 00:08:13.321
and she and I, of course, not only

179
00:08:13.321 --> 00:08:14.921
have created albums together, but

180
00:08:14.921 --> 00:08:19.101
New Age, or, I'm gonna use another term now.

181
00:08:19.101 --> 00:08:20.681
<v Voiceover>Yeah, that's getting old.</v>

182
00:08:20.681 --> 00:08:22.461
New Age is getting old, isn't it? (laughs)

183
00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:23.721
<v ->By gosh and by golly, New Age</v>

184
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:26.061
is running such a ga-mut that I

185
00:08:26.061 --> 00:08:27.581
turn on a station that quote supposedly

186
00:08:27.581 --> 00:08:30.161
New Age, and I got a little country

187
00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:33.361
western fiddle playing, then followed

188
00:08:33.361 --> 00:08:36.401
by Native American drumming, then

189
00:08:36.401 --> 00:08:37.881
followed by this and that, and I

190
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:39.741
said "hm," because as you may know,

191
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:43.401
one of my CD's was nominated for a Grammy this year,

192
00:08:43.401 --> 00:08:47.401
in the traditional world music category,

193
00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:49.001
and I have been really tempted now

194
00:08:49.001 --> 00:08:52.101
to see if I can communicate with the

195
00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:54.681
powers, be at the Grammys to see

196
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:57.821
if we can get a new category, whether

197
00:08:57.821 --> 00:09:00.661
you call it sacred music, healing music,

198
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:02.861
music for relaxation or whatnot,

199
00:09:02.861 --> 00:09:04.921
but it's very, very different, because

200
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:06.761
if I'm trying to chill out, I do not

201
00:09:06.761 --> 00:09:09.221
wanna be listening to something

202
00:09:09.221 --> 00:09:11.061
that's really fast rhythmatically,

203
00:09:11.061 --> 00:09:13.581
because it is not gonna help my nervous system,

204
00:09:13.581 --> 00:09:14.921
not that it's not great to listen to,

205
00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:16.481
if I'm driving it's great, but if I'm

206
00:09:16.481 --> 00:09:18.621
wanting to sleep it's a little different.

207
00:09:18.621 --> 00:09:19.781
<v Voiceover>Yeah, so let's talk about</v>

208
00:09:19.781 --> 00:09:21.821
that family dynamic, how families

209
00:09:21.821 --> 00:09:24.241
work together with varying tastes,

210
00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:27.441
and someone has control of the remote, (laughs)

211
00:09:27.441 --> 00:09:29.941
for the stereo, (laughs), and what

212
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:31.361
this does to each other and what

213
00:09:31.361 --> 00:09:32.501
this means, and I'm asking this

214
00:09:32.501 --> 00:09:34.881
because I would like to, as our

215
00:09:34.881 --> 00:09:39.061
viewers watch this, maybe understand

216
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:40.961
and learn to have a little more tolerance

217
00:09:40.961 --> 00:09:42.781
for each other, because sometimes,

218
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:45.081
you know, the kid needs to hear

219
00:09:45.081 --> 00:09:47.821
an int-enth rhythm for their area of growth at that time.

220
00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:49.901
<v ->Right, their metabolic rate is</v>

221
00:09:49.901 --> 00:09:53.641
very different, their nervous system is very different.

222
00:09:53.641 --> 00:09:54.881
They wanna hear something that's

223
00:09:54.881 --> 00:09:58.201
post at 160 beats per minute, while

224
00:09:58.201 --> 00:09:59.681
an adult whose nervous system hears

225
00:09:59.681 --> 00:10:01.301
a song that's vvvrrrrrr, it sounds

226
00:10:01.301 --> 00:10:03.061
like a jackhammer, might get like

227
00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:05.641
this and the kid gets chilled out.

228
00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:08.441
Some years ago, few years ago,

229
00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.861
a fellow who had a spiritual nightclub

230
00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:13.761
in Dublin flew out and he visited me, said,

231
00:10:13.761 --> 00:10:15.521
"Would you create spiritually uplifting

232
00:10:15.521 --> 00:10:18.541
"dance music based upon your chakra chants

233
00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:20.201
recording," which is an award-winning

234
00:10:20.201 --> 00:10:22.301
recording that I did, and I said,

235
00:10:22.301 --> 00:10:23.581
"Sure," so then I had to find somebody

236
00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:25.201
who was a little bit younger than me,

237
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:28.921
so who knew about creating dance music,

238
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:31.801
and we did it, and I would only go to a certain point.

239
00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:35.221
We went to about 144 beats per minute,

240
00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:40.041
which is pretty fast for folks over 40 years old,

241
00:10:40.041 --> 00:10:42.261
but folks under, you know, I listen to them, they go,

242
00:10:42.261 --> 00:10:43.721
"Oh, this is great meditation music,"

243
00:10:43.721 --> 00:10:45.581
and I'm going, "What?" (laughs)

244
00:10:45.581 --> 00:10:47.221
So, you know, once again, we do have,

245
00:10:47.221 --> 00:10:50.661
well, not only are all of us unique

246
00:10:50.661 --> 00:10:53.431
vibratory beings, but certainly,

247
00:10:53.431 --> 00:10:57.211
with our different ages, et cetera,

248
00:10:57.211 --> 00:10:59.731
you know, I remember when I was younger,

249
00:10:59.731 --> 00:11:04.071
Raphy, it was this nephew from two to six

250
00:11:04.071 --> 00:11:06.711
years old, almost every parent would

251
00:11:06.711 --> 00:11:09.831
have a Raphy, you know, he's sort

252
00:11:09.831 --> 00:11:14.831
of like the Beatles of the, you know,

253
00:11:14.951 --> 00:11:19.951
whatever you call children from two to six years old,

254
00:11:21.071 --> 00:11:25.731
toddlers, yes indeed, and so, just interesting,

255
00:11:25.731 --> 00:11:28.931
and I would, you know, play those things,

256
00:11:28.931 --> 00:11:33.491
but I think you hit it, tolerance is it,

257
00:11:33.491 --> 00:11:36.271
because we're all unique vibratory beings,

258
00:11:36.271 --> 00:11:39.831
and we're not all going to like the same music.

259
00:11:39.831 --> 00:11:43.371
So, you know, and if a type of music

260
00:11:43.371 --> 00:11:45.551
is particularly disturbing you,

261
00:11:45.551 --> 00:11:47.191
then I think you have to really honor

262
00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:51.171
that person as well, so that if a

263
00:11:51.171 --> 00:11:53.891
music is too loud for a person,

264
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:55.451
or disturbing the nervous system

265
00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:57.691
and really stressing them out,

266
00:11:57.691 --> 00:11:59.391
you know, that's the type of time

267
00:11:59.391 --> 00:12:00.811
when you might go, "Hey, would you

268
00:12:00.811 --> 00:12:03.251
"mind putting on headphones?"

269
00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:05.171
Because it's not gonna happen.

270
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:07.811
I understand the question, I don't

271
00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:11.871
have a solution in terms of there

272
00:12:11.871 --> 00:12:15.991
being a universal music that everybody can work with,

273
00:12:15.991 --> 00:12:18.431
because, depending upon the time,

274
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:20.811
the place, and the need of the individual.

275
00:12:20.811 --> 00:12:22.951
For example, the music that I create,

276
00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:24.572
which for the most part, except for that

277
00:12:24.572 --> 00:12:28.531
chakra dance, is very, very, pulsed

278
00:12:28.531 --> 00:12:30.891
at a slow rate, and, you know,

279
00:12:30.891 --> 00:12:32.591
designed for relaxation, well you

280
00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:35.411
don't wanna use that if you're doing aerobics.

281
00:12:35.411 --> 00:12:37.171
Now, a dear friend of mine who's a doctor,

282
00:12:37.171 --> 00:12:39.151
uses chakra dance all the time, goes,

283
00:12:39.151 --> 00:12:42.151
bum-bum-bum-bum-bum, but the other

284
00:12:42.151 --> 00:12:45.471
type of music, if you like physical rhythms

285
00:12:45.471 --> 00:12:47.851
your heartbeat respiration brain waves,

286
00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:50.671
will train, will begin to synchronize with this,

287
00:12:50.671 --> 00:12:52.451
and therefore, you will not have a

288
00:12:52.451 --> 00:12:53.871
lot of strength and power to be

289
00:12:53.871 --> 00:12:56.851
doing the various exercise machines that you have

290
00:12:56.851 --> 00:12:59.651
if it's very very slow, so you wanna basically

291
00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:02.052
use something, you wanna use music

292
00:13:02.052 --> 00:13:04.491
that is pulsed and works with the

293
00:13:04.491 --> 00:13:08.991
different types of activities that you're engaged in.

294
00:13:08.991 --> 00:13:09.711
<v Voiceover>And it's important</v>

295
00:13:09.711 --> 00:13:11.611
to honor that, and in terms of,

296
00:13:11.611 --> 00:13:13.951
you know what your body needs

297
00:13:13.951 --> 00:13:17.211
and your being is actually asking you to

298
00:13:17.211 --> 00:13:19.812
feed it when you want to hear a certain type of music.

299
00:13:19.812 --> 00:13:21.552
<v ->Right, sound can be a nutrition.</v>

300
00:13:21.552 --> 00:13:25.291
Most people are not, however, as

301
00:13:25.291 --> 00:13:27.911
aware as you might be about this whole thing,

302
00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:29.511
where lot of people have never thought

303
00:13:29.511 --> 00:13:32.591
about the fact that different types of music

304
00:13:32.591 --> 00:13:34.891
will elicit different responses.

305
00:13:34.891 --> 00:13:36.471
So that, for example, if you walk

306
00:13:36.471 --> 00:13:39.571
into a restaurant, you'll often times

307
00:13:39.571 --> 00:13:41.591
find that they have fast, dn-ch-ch,

308
00:13:41.591 --> 00:13:43.811
you know, pop music going on, and

309
00:13:43.811 --> 00:13:45.491
that's done purposely so the people

310
00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:47.052
eat quickly, 'cause as a friend of mine says,

311
00:13:47.052 --> 00:13:49.451
you eat to the beat, and if you wanna

312
00:13:49.451 --> 00:13:54.451
enjoy your meal, you'll hopefully

313
00:13:55.371 --> 00:13:57.331
have something that's nice and soothing,

314
00:13:57.331 --> 00:14:02.211
and not really fast, et cetera, because--
<v Voiceover>So you can chew, digest.</v>

315
00:14:02.211 --> 00:14:04.931
<v ->Right, you know, get in there, chew, get out,</v>

316
00:14:04.931 --> 00:14:06.792
you know, in ten minutes as opposed to a half hour.

317
00:14:06.792 --> 00:14:07.792
<v Voiceover>Same thing, and the</v>

318
00:14:07.792 --> 00:14:09.311
vibration of colors paired with that.

319
00:14:09.311 --> 00:14:11.491
So you have a lot of yellows and oranges

320
00:14:11.491 --> 00:14:13.171
and reds in the fast food environments

321
00:14:13.171 --> 00:14:15.111
because, like, the music, it gets you

322
00:14:15.111 --> 00:14:18.371
in and out fast, it creates hyperactivity,

323
00:14:18.371 --> 00:14:20.311
it's unnerving to an extent, but that's,

324
00:14:20.311 --> 00:14:24.591
digestion isn't the issue, sales are. (laughs)

325
00:14:24.591 --> 00:14:26.292
Turn those tables quickly!

326
00:14:26.292 --> 00:14:28.052
Let's talk about the notion of,

327
00:14:28.052 --> 00:14:29.251
and thank you for addressing that,

328
00:14:29.251 --> 00:14:30.751
I just think it's important, I think,

329
00:14:30.751 --> 00:14:32.552
for all of us to understand that

330
00:14:32.552 --> 00:14:34.931
we are each so unique, and our

331
00:14:34.931 --> 00:14:37.911
need for that vibratory field around us,

332
00:14:37.911 --> 00:14:41.071
and not to be too judgmental of each other.
<v ->Right, you're not gonna make anybody</v>

333
00:14:41.071 --> 00:14:44.211
wrong, and you realize that at times,

334
00:14:44.211 --> 00:14:46.431
certain people will need certain things,

335
00:14:46.431 --> 00:14:48.371
and also to really honor - the one thing

336
00:14:48.371 --> 00:14:52.552
we don't honor is the sonic space around us

337
00:14:52.552 --> 00:14:57.331
so that people will be very very loud, for example,

338
00:14:57.331 --> 00:14:59.691
you know, there you are, sitting at the beach,

339
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:02.231
it's idyllic, you have the sound of the ocean,

340
00:15:02.231 --> 00:15:05.091
and the sun is on you, and the seagulls,

341
00:15:05.091 --> 00:15:06.842
all of a sudden, somebody sits next to you

342
00:15:06.842 --> 00:15:09.701
with a really loud boombox playing

343
00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:11.842
some really up tempo music, and it's like,

344
00:15:11.842 --> 00:15:15.481
"Excuse me, but do you realize

345
00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:20.021
"how invasive that is into my field?

346
00:15:20.021 --> 00:15:22.261
"And how you're totally decimating

347
00:15:22.261 --> 00:15:25.761
this particular vibrational field by sound?"

348
00:15:25.761 --> 00:15:27.761
People are unaware of really the power

349
00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:30.141
of sound to really extraordinarily shift

350
00:15:30.141 --> 00:15:32.361
and change, not only our consciousness,

351
00:15:32.361 --> 00:15:34.961
but really ruin a good time. (laughs)

352
00:15:34.961 --> 00:15:35.961
<v Voiceover>Right, and that includes</v>

353
00:15:35.961 --> 00:15:38.381
people's voices, especially in the city,

354
00:15:38.381 --> 00:15:40.161
where people are competing with each other

355
00:15:40.161 --> 00:15:42.781
and are competing with other noise pollutants

356
00:15:42.781 --> 00:15:44.082
and people start developing really

357
00:15:44.082 --> 00:15:47.342
loud ranges of speaking voice.

358
00:15:47.342 --> 00:15:48.741
<v ->And the other aspect of that is</v>

359
00:15:48.741 --> 00:15:51.881
last time I was in New York City,

360
00:15:51.881 --> 00:15:54.082
I seen lotta people walking with headphones and all.

361
00:15:54.082 --> 00:15:56.562
The sound, as I mentioned from the New York Times

362
00:15:56.562 --> 00:16:00.861
article, goes into you on a cellular level.

363
00:16:00.861 --> 00:16:04.161
And therefore, whether you're aware

364
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:07.322
of it or not, there's still detrimental aspects

365
00:16:07.322 --> 00:16:10.062
of the sound that are being created.

366
00:16:10.062 --> 00:16:13.681
So we really need to be more aware of the power of sound.

367
00:16:13.681 --> 00:16:17.121
That's part of what I've been doing for the last 25 years,

368
00:16:17.121 --> 00:16:19.681
is making people really aware of

369
00:16:19.681 --> 00:16:21.921
the power of sound to heal and transform

370
00:16:21.921 --> 00:16:25.643
and of course anytime you have any substance

371
00:16:25.643 --> 00:16:27.902
that can be used as a positive, beneficial tool,

372
00:16:27.902 --> 00:16:29.942
you can also use this way, but now

373
00:16:29.942 --> 00:16:32.083
there's so many people that I've taught

374
00:16:32.083 --> 00:16:33.582
who are teaching this stuff that

375
00:16:33.582 --> 00:16:35.902
I'm really now focusing on more

376
00:16:35.902 --> 00:16:40.902
of the planetary work for trying to heal

377
00:16:41.062 --> 00:16:43.742
and create harmony and balance.

378
00:16:43.742 --> 00:16:46.062
<v Voiceover>Well let's talk about consciousness,</v>

379
00:16:46.062 --> 00:16:47.122
right, I mean, that sounds like a

380
00:16:47.122 --> 00:16:49.562
good jumping-off point into the field of consciousness.

381
00:16:49.562 --> 00:16:52.422
Sound has historically been used

382
00:16:52.422 --> 00:16:57.322
for the advancement of one's own consciousness, correct?

383
00:16:57.322 --> 00:16:58.562
<v ->Yes, indeed.</v>

384
00:16:58.562 --> 00:17:01.462
<v ->And can you talk about how this works</v>

385
00:17:01.462 --> 00:17:03.682
and how this actually expands your

386
00:17:03.682 --> 00:17:06.602
ability to perceive and your field of awareness?

387
00:17:06.602 --> 00:17:10.862
<v ->How many hours, no I'm sorry. (laughs)
<v ->We have about ten minutes. (laughs)</v>

388
00:17:10.862 --> 00:17:12.862
<v ->Yeah, we do a nine-day healing sounds</v>

389
00:17:12.862 --> 00:17:17.182
intensive, and at the end of those nine days,

390
00:17:17.182 --> 00:17:19.042
we go from nine in the morning

391
00:17:19.042 --> 00:17:21.362
to about nine at night, teaching,

392
00:17:21.362 --> 00:17:23.842
experiencing, chanting, dancing,

393
00:17:23.842 --> 00:17:25.102
and drumming and all this stuff,

394
00:17:25.102 --> 00:17:26.463
for all the different purposes,

395
00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:27.802
and this thing is extraordinary,

396
00:17:27.802 --> 00:17:29.702
and it's at the end of nine days

397
00:17:29.702 --> 00:17:32.802
that I feel like we perhaps have scratched the surface.

398
00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:34.892
So I'll just suggest that --

399
00:17:34.892 --> 00:17:37.422
<v Voiceover>We'll just speak about it more theoretically.</v>

400
00:17:37.422 --> 00:17:39.902
And we'll play a little bit of some

401
00:17:39.902 --> 00:17:41.763
of the sounds from one of your CD's

402
00:17:41.763 --> 00:17:43.323
here at the end of this interview

403
00:17:43.323 --> 00:17:44.763
so people can stay tuned, close

404
00:17:44.763 --> 00:17:46.963
their eyes, and listen for a bit.

405
00:17:46.963 --> 00:17:48.123
<v ->But I'd like to suggest that</v>

406
00:17:48.123 --> 00:17:51.623
I really began getting into this

407
00:17:51.623 --> 00:17:53.803
on a very, very left brain logical

408
00:17:53.803 --> 00:17:56.423
level of frequencies and what different

409
00:17:56.423 --> 00:18:00.783
frequencies do to our physical body,

410
00:18:00.783 --> 00:18:04.643
our nervous system, our emotional state -

411
00:18:04.643 --> 00:18:06.863
this, that, and the other thing.

412
00:18:06.863 --> 00:18:09.063
And I'm still very, very aware of this

413
00:18:09.063 --> 00:18:11.603
and I utilize different tones,

414
00:18:11.603 --> 00:18:14.423
different intervals, all the time.

415
00:18:14.423 --> 00:18:17.663
But as I began to explore the realm of sound,

416
00:18:17.663 --> 00:18:20.603
of course, the realm of what could be considered

417
00:18:20.603 --> 00:18:22.683
"sacred sound" with different mantras,

418
00:18:22.683 --> 00:18:26.183
different chants, different divine languages,

419
00:18:26.183 --> 00:18:28.623
sacred languages being used, and

420
00:18:28.623 --> 00:18:31.723
I began to realize the power also

421
00:18:31.723 --> 00:18:34.323
of these mantras, these chants,

422
00:18:34.323 --> 00:18:36.043
were from whatever tradition,

423
00:18:36.043 --> 00:18:38.683
we find that basically, there are

424
00:18:38.683 --> 00:18:41.343
sacred chants found in almost every

425
00:18:41.343 --> 00:18:45.526
tradition on the planet, and I'm very --
<v Voiceover>From Gregorian, right,</v>

426
00:18:45.526 --> 00:18:47.746
all the way, Native American, Tibetan.

427
00:18:47.746 --> 00:18:51.886
<v ->Tibetan, Hindu, Aramaic, Islamic,</v>

428
00:18:51.886 --> 00:18:54.687
we can go on and on, and I'm very

429
00:18:54.687 --> 00:18:57.646
non-sectarian, so, many of my different recordings

430
00:18:57.646 --> 00:19:02.366
either are, one will be a Judeo-Christian one,

431
00:19:02.366 --> 00:19:04.546
another will be a Tibetan one,

432
00:19:04.546 --> 00:19:08.526
or I will combine the Hebrew, Tibetan,

433
00:19:08.526 --> 00:19:12.346
and Hindu mantras simultaneously going,

434
00:19:12.346 --> 00:19:15.366
and there is something about these

435
00:19:15.366 --> 00:19:17.486
sacred sounds, which, when coupled with

436
00:19:17.486 --> 00:19:19.346
what we call psycho-acoustics,

437
00:19:19.346 --> 00:19:22.046
or the effects of frequencies on the brain,

438
00:19:22.046 --> 00:19:25.466
seem to me to really have the extraordinary

439
00:19:25.466 --> 00:19:28.795
ability of amplifying all the, like

440
00:19:28.795 --> 00:19:31.925
the frequency plus intent, I just

441
00:19:31.925 --> 00:19:33.585
really work together beautifully,

442
00:19:33.585 --> 00:19:37.145
so, most of my recordings employ

443
00:19:37.145 --> 00:19:41.546
not only the frequencies or the tones,

444
00:19:41.546 --> 00:19:46.065
but also, the sacred mantras, and

445
00:19:46.065 --> 00:19:47.925
it's extraordinarily powerful.
<v Voiceover>Oh, and some of them are.</v>

446
00:19:47.925 --> 00:19:50.265
I've heard a number of them actually,

447
00:19:50.265 --> 00:19:52.745
but the sound that some people find

448
00:19:52.745 --> 00:19:56.345
initially discordant is that of say, the Tibetan Monks,

449
00:19:56.345 --> 00:19:59.865
that deep, rumbling, and you have mastered that.

450
00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.785
You can generate that with your own voice,

451
00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:04.765
and just an incredible sound, and

452
00:20:04.765 --> 00:20:07.105
at first, it's, "Ugh, what is that?"

453
00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:09.045
But what's actually going on there?

454
00:20:09.045 --> 00:20:10.585
<v ->Okay, that's a great question,</v>

455
00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:12.525
and I have a somewhat humorous story,

456
00:20:12.525 --> 00:20:14.305
first, and we may have to cut this,

457
00:20:14.305 --> 00:20:16.825
but this is sort of what we're gonna be talking about.

458
00:20:16.825 --> 00:20:21.825
The Tibetan deep voices, (deep throaty sound)

459
00:20:26.505 --> 00:20:27.745
<v Voiceover>It's almost like a didgeridoo.</v>

460
00:20:27.745 --> 00:20:30.665
<v ->Yes, very much so, and basically,</v>

461
00:20:30.665 --> 00:20:32.825
real quick story, was that I recorded

462
00:20:32.825 --> 00:20:36.125
the Yu-may Tibetan Monks; it was

463
00:20:36.125 --> 00:20:39.165
first on the United States, we

464
00:20:39.165 --> 00:20:40.945
brought them into the recording studio,

465
00:20:40.945 --> 00:20:43.845
I recorded them, and then I went

466
00:20:43.845 --> 00:20:45.885
into my meditation room that night,

467
00:20:45.885 --> 00:20:50.205
I basically had a cassette of the recording.

468
00:20:50.205 --> 00:20:52.905
I woke up the next morning and I had the deep voice.

469
00:20:52.905 --> 00:20:56.025
Which is supposed to take them ten years to receive,

470
00:20:56.025 --> 00:20:58.845
but then, people in my presence often times,

471
00:20:58.845 --> 00:21:01.705
I wouldn't be surprised if at the end of this interview,

472
00:21:01.705 --> 00:21:04.205
<v Voiceover>My voice projects better. (laughs)</v>

473
00:21:04.205 --> 00:21:06.945
<v ->No, you might even be doing the deep voice, but okay.</v>

474
00:21:06.945 --> 00:21:11.325
I've often been, if you are fascinated by that voice,

475
00:21:11.325 --> 00:21:13.925
because not only is it an extraordinarily powerful

476
00:21:13.925 --> 00:21:17.285
voice, and perhaps, primordial voice,

477
00:21:17.285 --> 00:21:20.645
but I just really, really loved it.

478
00:21:20.645 --> 00:21:23.425
And I remember one time, I was doing a presentation

479
00:21:23.425 --> 00:21:28.065
to a group of nuns on sound, and how

480
00:21:28.065 --> 00:21:29.606
sound can be used for healing.

481
00:21:29.606 --> 00:21:31.465
I played examples of different

482
00:21:31.465 --> 00:21:33.726
chants and mantras from different traditions,

483
00:21:33.726 --> 00:21:37.005
and all of a sudden, I played the Tibetan deep voice,

484
00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:41.125
and several of the nuns literally ran out of the room.

485
00:21:41.125 --> 00:21:42.945
And I was at a loss, and all of a sudden

486
00:21:42.945 --> 00:21:44.505
sudden I realized what had gone down.

487
00:21:44.505 --> 00:21:47.716
<v Voiceover>Oh, I can kind of almost guess, go ahead.</v>

488
00:21:47.716 --> 00:21:52.096
<v ->Okay, in the 1970's, 1980's,</v>

489
00:21:52.096 --> 00:21:54.036
there were a number of film makers

490
00:21:54.036 --> 00:21:56.456
who will remain anonymous, who uses

491
00:21:56.456 --> 00:22:00.116
the soundtrack when there were Satanic rituals going on.

492
00:22:00.116 --> 00:22:01.996
Two pieces of music, Cor-mi ne-bra-da,

493
00:22:01.996 --> 00:22:05.736
do do do do do do, and the Tibetan deep voice,

494
00:22:05.736 --> 00:22:07.236
(deep throaty sound)

495
00:22:07.236 --> 00:22:10.516
So you'd see some horrific image with these sounds.

496
00:22:10.516 --> 00:22:11.416
<v Voiceover>Exactly, and I think</v>

497
00:22:11.416 --> 00:22:13.406
a lot of people associate it with that, not just the nuns.

498
00:22:13.406 --> 00:22:15.986
<v ->No, no, no, no, that was just what happened to me,</v>

499
00:22:15.986 --> 00:22:18.166
is I came to that realization, a lot of people

500
00:22:18.166 --> 00:22:20.806
have, you know, thinking that there's

501
00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:22.386
something very dark when really,

502
00:22:22.386 --> 00:22:25.466
on a level, the sound is one of the most

503
00:22:25.466 --> 00:22:29.966
extraordinary, purifying tones that exists on the planet.

504
00:22:29.966 --> 00:22:31.326
<v Voiceover>Very deep impact.</v>

505
00:22:31.326 --> 00:22:34.886
<v ->Right and so, you know, how we respond</v>

506
00:22:34.886 --> 00:22:37.326
to sound, this is a whole 'nother level,

507
00:22:37.326 --> 00:22:39.166
but how we respond to sounds that

508
00:22:39.166 --> 00:22:42.346
we haven't heard, whether it's programming,

509
00:22:42.346 --> 00:22:44.886
or whatnot, you know, now you'll

510
00:22:44.886 --> 00:22:48.486
see these songs to be used for advertising on TV,

511
00:22:48.486 --> 00:22:50.846
and the car-mee-na ba-ra-das, I've seen it,

512
00:22:50.846 --> 00:22:55.846
I've seen used now for various commercials,

513
00:22:55.956 --> 00:22:58.796
and this and that, or, you know, if something

514
00:22:58.796 --> 00:23:00.516
is used and people begin to accept

515
00:23:00.516 --> 00:23:02.736
that these new, strange sounds,

516
00:23:02.736 --> 00:23:05.956
it's really interesting, which is why

517
00:23:05.956 --> 00:23:08.316
I like to say that my work involves

518
00:23:08.316 --> 00:23:10.136
a little bit of entertainment,

519
00:23:10.136 --> 00:23:12.496
little bit of education, little bit of enlightenment,

520
00:23:12.496 --> 00:23:15.456
but you need the education, and most

521
00:23:15.456 --> 00:23:17.576
of the CD's that I create have

522
00:23:17.576 --> 00:23:22.296
booklets in between 16 and 32 pages in length,

523
00:23:22.296 --> 00:23:24.316
so that the person who is listening

524
00:23:24.316 --> 00:23:27.996
can read about what these sounds represent.

525
00:23:27.996 --> 00:23:30.656
<v Voiceover>Yes, that's wonderful service, really.</v>

526
00:23:30.656 --> 00:23:33.176
So what about hemi-sync, the whole

527
00:23:33.176 --> 00:23:35.196
notion of hemi-sync and using sound

528
00:23:35.196 --> 00:23:37.516
and tonalities to synchronize the

529
00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:39.596
right and left hemispheres of the brain?

530
00:23:39.596 --> 00:23:42.396
I find this kind of an interesting subject.

531
00:23:42.396 --> 00:23:45.556
<v ->Well, (clears throat), excuse me, sorry about that,</v>

532
00:23:45.556 --> 00:23:49.656
we hope that you'll cut that reel out.
<v Voiceover>You'll be alright, you're human.</v>

533
00:23:49.656 --> 00:23:51.796
<v ->I'm one of, actually, the first people to</v>

534
00:23:51.796 --> 00:23:55.616
have brought that to the consciousness

535
00:23:55.616 --> 00:24:00.616
of the planet in a 1986 article that I wrote

536
00:24:01.536 --> 00:24:04.136
that's been republished and is on our website,

537
00:24:04.136 --> 00:24:07.096
called "Sonic Entrainment", but

538
00:24:07.096 --> 00:24:09.716
I was basically trying to find different ways

539
00:24:09.716 --> 00:24:13.796
that sounds could be used to change

540
00:24:13.796 --> 00:24:16.596
and shift, if you like, vibrational levels,

541
00:24:16.596 --> 00:24:18.856
or consciousness or whatnot, and

542
00:24:18.856 --> 00:24:19.976
there's this fellow by the name of

543
00:24:19.976 --> 00:24:22.536
Robert Monroe, who basically being

544
00:24:22.536 --> 00:24:24.927
have these out-of-body experiences,

545
00:24:24.927 --> 00:24:26.786
and what happened is he tried to find

546
00:24:26.786 --> 00:24:29.086
a sound that would trigger the

547
00:24:29.086 --> 00:24:31.226
out-of-body experiences; he was

548
00:24:31.226 --> 00:24:32.986
not successful in doing that, but

549
00:24:32.986 --> 00:24:37.146
what he found was that if you have

550
00:24:37.146 --> 00:24:39.606
a slightly different, let's say,

551
00:24:39.606 --> 00:24:41.306
sound is measured in cycles a second,

552
00:24:41.306 --> 00:24:43.866
and if I have a hundred cycles a second in this ear

553
00:24:43.866 --> 00:24:46.386
and 104 in this ear, the predominant lobes

554
00:24:46.386 --> 00:24:49.466
of the brain will basically vibrate to

555
00:24:49.466 --> 00:24:52.706
the four-cycle-second difference between these two.

556
00:24:52.706 --> 00:24:55.446
And I thought, "Well this is really, really fascinating,"

557
00:24:55.446 --> 00:24:59.406
And I have utilized this in a couple

558
00:24:59.406 --> 00:25:01.026
of different recordings; one in particular

559
00:25:01.026 --> 00:25:04.126
called "The Tantra of Sound Harmonizer,"

560
00:25:04.126 --> 00:25:05.986
which, to my knowledge, is the first

561
00:25:05.986 --> 00:25:08.446
recording that balances not only

562
00:25:08.446 --> 00:25:11.706
your brainwaves but the chakra simultaneously.

563
00:25:11.706 --> 00:25:14.026
So I think that this is very, very good,

564
00:25:14.026 --> 00:25:16.386
and yet there's a great responsibility,

565
00:25:16.386 --> 00:25:17.766
letting people know, so that, for example,

566
00:25:17.766 --> 00:25:22.766
at the flip side of the CD cover it says,

567
00:25:24.116 --> 00:25:28.186
"Do not use while driving or operating heavy machinery."

568
00:25:28.186 --> 00:25:31.466
Because, you know--
<v Voiceover>Very true, it doesn't train the brain,</v>

569
00:25:31.466 --> 00:25:34.567
and you are immediately transported to another brain state.

570
00:25:34.567 --> 00:25:37.866
I use them, I use a particular one for studying.
<v ->You can also use pythagorean</v>

571
00:25:37.866 --> 00:25:40.766
turning forks, or my other recordings,

572
00:25:40.766 --> 00:25:43.186
I seen from me the lost chord for instance.

573
00:25:43.186 --> 00:25:44.546
You sit and you listen to these things,

574
00:25:44.546 --> 00:25:47.486
and they're extremely powerful.

575
00:25:47.486 --> 00:25:51.127
The lost chord is all based upon the phi ratio,

576
00:25:51.127 --> 00:25:53.366
and that's when it has the Tibetan,

577
00:25:53.366 --> 00:25:55.567
Hindu, and Hebrew simultaneously

578
00:25:55.567 --> 00:25:58.306
going up the chakras, and the tree

579
00:25:58.306 --> 00:26:01.067
of life, which is a Judeo-Christian,

580
00:26:01.067 --> 00:26:05.166
if you like, mystic, a woman by

581
00:26:05.166 --> 00:26:07.966
the name of Carolyn Mace put them both together,

582
00:26:07.966 --> 00:26:09.686
and I really like that whole lot.

583
00:26:09.686 --> 00:26:11.186
So, there are other ways besides

584
00:26:11.186 --> 00:26:16.186
purely this of inducing different states of consciousness,

585
00:26:16.426 --> 00:26:18.466
and a lot of it again is also the

586
00:26:18.466 --> 00:26:22.406
intentionality of the person creating the sound.

587
00:26:22.406 --> 00:26:27.406
So I'm always really, really aware

588
00:26:27.766 --> 00:26:29.686
that the sounds that I'm making,

589
00:26:29.686 --> 00:26:32.186
when I'm doing studying for a recording,

590
00:26:32.186 --> 00:26:33.866
will be received by other people.

591
00:26:33.866 --> 00:26:37.546
So if I make offerings and ask that

592
00:26:37.546 --> 00:26:40.746
greatest good be achieved through

593
00:26:40.746 --> 00:26:42.567
the sounds that I create, and if

594
00:26:42.567 --> 00:26:47.567
somehow, I'm feeling off, and I don't feel like I'm

595
00:26:48.246 --> 00:26:51.947
being a true conduit for sacred sound, I will not record.

596
00:26:51.947 --> 00:26:53.586
<v Voiceover>No, that makes perfect sense.</v>

597
00:26:53.586 --> 00:26:57.086
You don't wanna be poisoning any wells out there. (laughs)

598
00:26:57.086 --> 00:27:00.046
No, you recently also were teaching at

599
00:27:00.046 --> 00:27:02.366
a large conference on reiki healing,

600
00:27:02.366 --> 00:27:04.866
can you talk about how these vibrations go together?

601
00:27:04.866 --> 00:27:07.746
<v ->Yes, well, about a year ago,</v>

602
00:27:07.746 --> 00:27:11.926
I was at the first international sun

603
00:27:11.926 --> 00:27:15.426
reiki conference in Sedona, and someone,

604
00:27:15.426 --> 00:27:19.506
a Frenchman, gave out these ancient

605
00:27:19.506 --> 00:27:21.926
chants that were said to be the

606
00:27:21.926 --> 00:27:26.226
embodiment of the reiki symbols,

607
00:27:26.226 --> 00:27:28.326
and he did it very, very fast so,

608
00:27:28.326 --> 00:27:32.646
it'd be like, (fast throaty vocalization),

609
00:27:32.646 --> 00:27:36.186
and I heard it, and I realized and I got the power of it,

610
00:27:36.186 --> 00:27:38.886
but I thought, "Wouldn't it be great

611
00:27:38.886 --> 00:27:41.006
"if I could create a recording

612
00:27:41.006 --> 00:27:43.506
"that had these mantras on them,

613
00:27:43.506 --> 00:27:45.986
"but did it in such a fashion so

614
00:27:45.986 --> 00:27:48.186
"that they were extremely mentally powerful,

615
00:27:48.186 --> 00:27:51.466
"still with the like intentionality of

616
00:27:51.466 --> 00:27:55.046
"the energy of the reiki chants and the

617
00:27:55.046 --> 00:27:59.526
"reiki symbols on them, but also beautiful to listen to?"

618
00:27:59.526 --> 00:28:01.886
And it took me practically a year to do this.

619
00:28:01.886 --> 00:28:05.966
This one recording, which was just

620
00:28:05.966 --> 00:28:08.946
released about a month ago, called "Reiki Chants"

621
00:28:08.946 --> 00:28:10.846
came out, but there are three other

622
00:28:10.846 --> 00:28:15.306
complete full CD's that basically

623
00:28:15.306 --> 00:28:18.986
were the same chants done in different keys,

624
00:28:18.986 --> 00:28:21.186
with different instrumental backing,

625
00:28:21.186 --> 00:28:25.826
with different harmonics used,

626
00:28:25.826 --> 00:28:28.306
with different melodic lines used,

627
00:28:28.306 --> 00:28:30.666
with different scales used, and I

628
00:28:30.666 --> 00:28:34.326
would try them on myself and my dear wife, Andy,

629
00:28:34.326 --> 00:28:37.046
and other people, and just, we'd sort of do

630
00:28:37.046 --> 00:28:40.206
tests, like beta tests, to see which

631
00:28:40.206 --> 00:28:42.526
were not only the most effective,

632
00:28:42.526 --> 00:28:44.346
but which were the most listenable.

633
00:28:44.346 --> 00:28:47.606
Because, just because something is a

634
00:28:47.606 --> 00:28:50.546
quote healing sound, if you can't listen to it...

635
00:28:50.546 --> 00:28:52.306
<v Voiceover>It's not gonna heal much.</v>

636
00:28:52.306 --> 00:28:54.886
<v ->Right, so this one, I'm really proud of, because</v>

637
00:28:54.886 --> 00:28:58.156
I think it's the most beautiful recording that I've --

638
00:28:58.156 --> 00:28:59.556
<v Voiceover>The one that's called "Reiki Chants"?</v>

639
00:28:59.556 --> 00:29:03.936
<v ->"Reiki Chants", and really, really like it.</v>

640
00:29:03.936 --> 00:29:04.976
<v Voiceover>If you like that best,</v>

641
00:29:04.976 --> 00:29:06.516
maybe that's the one, would you

642
00:29:06.516 --> 00:29:08.056
like us to run that one at the end?

643
00:29:08.056 --> 00:29:09.396
You choose, what would you like

644
00:29:09.396 --> 00:29:10.736
people to experience for a few

645
00:29:10.736 --> 00:29:12.556
minutes at the end of this interview?

646
00:29:12.556 --> 00:29:15.136
<v ->Probably "Ultimate Ohm", probably</v>

647
00:29:15.136 --> 00:29:17.916
"Ultimate Ohm" because that's the most universal.

648
00:29:17.916 --> 00:29:20.636
<v Voiceover>I have it at home, so that's easy then.</v>
<v ->Right and it's also on this</v>

649
00:29:20.636 --> 00:29:23.756
recording over here, "Frequencies",

650
00:29:23.756 --> 00:29:25.736
which is an excerpt of 13 of my

651
00:29:25.736 --> 00:29:27.816
different ones, but "Ultimate Ohm"

652
00:29:27.816 --> 00:29:30.936
seems to just be so very, very nice

653
00:29:30.936 --> 00:29:33.496
and very, very calming, but, "Reiki Chants"

654
00:29:33.496 --> 00:29:35.196
I like a lot; it's almost as though

655
00:29:35.196 --> 00:29:37.977
what if the, I don't know who else

656
00:29:37.977 --> 00:29:39.936
you know, perhaps you can give me a name,

657
00:29:39.936 --> 00:29:41.276
but what's the name of a gu-ra,

658
00:29:41.276 --> 00:29:42.436
the only great choral group that

659
00:29:42.436 --> 00:29:45.056
I can think of is the Mormon Tabern of Us.
<v Voiceover>Mormon Tabern of Us?</v>

660
00:29:45.056 --> 00:29:46.536
First one that pops to mind. (laughs)

661
00:29:46.536 --> 00:29:48.477
<v ->It's like, you know, what if the</v>

662
00:29:48.477 --> 00:29:50.556
Mormon Tabernacle Choir were chanting

663
00:29:50.556 --> 00:29:53.936
these sacred Ta-ma-do Oriental chants,

664
00:29:53.936 --> 00:29:56.316
but, oh, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir

665
00:29:56.316 --> 00:29:59.636
has unto itself a certain vibe,

666
00:29:59.636 --> 00:30:04.357
so I'm at this moment, big question mark,

667
00:30:04.357 --> 00:30:06.926
the blank-blank choir, doing these

668
00:30:06.926 --> 00:30:10.237
wonderful, 'cause it's really sonically quite gorgeous.

669
00:30:10.237 --> 00:30:11.386
<v Voiceover>It is gorgeous and it has</v>

670
00:30:11.386 --> 00:30:13.027
a profound effect, I mean, for me

671
00:30:13.027 --> 00:30:14.626
personally, I immediately feel

672
00:30:14.626 --> 00:30:16.966
like, foom, and it go right into the heart.

673
00:30:16.966 --> 00:30:21.506
Well, beautiful body of work, incredible career,

674
00:30:21.506 --> 00:30:22.886
and then we'll make sure that everybody

675
00:30:22.886 --> 00:30:24.446
has a chance to hear a little bit of this

676
00:30:24.446 --> 00:30:26.946
in just a minute, and they can look

677
00:30:26.946 --> 00:30:28.566
right underneath this little window

678
00:30:28.566 --> 00:30:30.326
they're seeing you in, and see the

679
00:30:30.326 --> 00:30:32.866
rest of your CD's and books, et cetera,

680
00:30:32.866 --> 00:30:34.466
and thank you so much for your time.

681
00:30:34.466 --> 00:30:36.226
<v ->Well, thank you, and one last thing</v>

682
00:30:36.226 --> 00:30:37.886
that I didn't mention but it's

683
00:30:37.886 --> 00:30:41.966
really one of the main focuses of my work.

684
00:30:41.966 --> 00:30:44.366
We all have the most extraordinary

685
00:30:44.366 --> 00:30:47.466
instrument for healing; it doesn't

686
00:30:47.466 --> 00:30:50.686
require electricity, doesn't require batteries,

687
00:30:50.686 --> 00:30:52.407
you don't need a CD player, don't

688
00:30:52.407 --> 00:30:54.486
need the owner's manual, it's relatively

689
00:30:54.486 --> 00:30:58.546
easy to use, and that is, we can all use our

690
00:30:58.546 --> 00:31:00.946
voice as an instrument for healing.

691
00:31:00.946 --> 00:31:02.667
That's different than getting up

692
00:31:02.667 --> 00:31:04.346
and singing "Strangers in the Night"

693
00:31:04.346 --> 00:31:06.866
in front of an audience; that's entertainment.

694
00:31:06.866 --> 00:31:09.946
But we can all use sound to basically

695
00:31:09.946 --> 00:31:12.167
resonate different parts of our bodies,

696
00:31:12.167 --> 00:31:13.826
our chakras, our energy fields,

697
00:31:13.826 --> 00:31:15.826
whatever term you want, and I just

698
