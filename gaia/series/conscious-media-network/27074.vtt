00:00:00.468 --> 00:00:02.516
<v ->Did I have fun on this one.</v>

2
00:00:02.516 --> 00:00:03.881
William Henry is an author and

3
00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:05.856
investigative mythologist, while much

4
00:00:05.856 --> 00:00:07.903
of his work has been centered on

5
00:00:07.903 --> 00:00:09.972
Egyptian symbolism William has

6
00:00:09.972 --> 00:00:12.606
also delved into the understanding of stargates

7
00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:15.283
as have the secretive elements of our military.

8
00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:17.160
I was intrigued to speak to him about this

9
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.347
because of information that has surfaced

10
00:00:19.347 --> 00:00:22.786
regarding the presence of natural stargates in Iraq.

11
00:00:23.432 --> 00:00:25.299
Puts another more mysterious spin

12
00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:26.771
on the US presence there.

13
00:00:26.771 --> 00:00:28.349
By the way Saddam Hussein was

14
00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.892
equally interested in this phenomenon.

15
00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:42.226
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about stargate 101,</v>

16
00:00:42.226 --> 00:00:45.590
we're beginning to hear the term stargate more often

17
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.123
and I think there are a lot of differing views

18
00:00:48.123 --> 00:00:49.829
as to what a stargate is and a lot

19
00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.610
of it has been popularized by Hollywood.

20
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.081
<v ->Right.
<v Voiceover>So let's</v>

21
00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:56.655
talk about what you perceive stargates to be.

22
00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:58.607
<v ->I think of stargates on three levels,</v>

23
00:00:58.607 --> 00:01:02.095
I think of it as, literally, a connection between stars.

24
00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:05.892
From the heart of one sun to the heart of another sun.

25
00:01:05.892 --> 00:01:08.825
On the earthly level they are literally portals

26
00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:11.865
or places on earth where the stellar

27
00:01:11.865 --> 00:01:14.264
energy is concentrated, you think of

28
00:01:14.264 --> 00:01:16.504
places like Sedona, vortexes, you think of

29
00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:18.979
the Great Pyramid complex in Giza,

30
00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.134
places where this energy is concentrated

31
00:01:21.134 --> 00:01:23.331
and where it's palpable or you can feel it.

32
00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:24.770
And then at a third level I think

33
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.934
of a stargate as literally as a gateway

34
00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:30.305
from a point on earth to other places on earth or

35
00:01:30.305 --> 00:01:32.481
perhaps even to other star systems.

36
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:34.411
<v Voiceover>I.e. wormholes?</v>
<v ->I.e. wormholes.</v>

37
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:38.167
I equate the stargate with the wormhole, exactly.

38
00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:39.873
<v Voiceover>So how is this, why do we</v>

39
00:01:39.873 --> 00:01:41.280
need to know about this and how

40
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.837
is this functional or useful because

41
00:01:42.837 --> 00:01:44.896
certainly everything that I've read about it

42
00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:48.266
is almost always very cloaked in secrecy

43
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:49.973
and it has military implications.

44
00:01:49.973 --> 00:01:51.989
<v ->Right but when, I'm a mythologist</v>

45
00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:53.727
so when you go back into the ancient record

46
00:01:53.727 --> 00:01:56.415
the oldest human story, well let's

47
00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:59.220
go back to Gilgamesh, the oldest human

48
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.394
story is about Gilgamesh and his

49
00:02:00.394 --> 00:02:02.527
quest for immortality, he's told by

50
00:02:02.527 --> 00:02:04.821
a goddess that he's two thirds divine

51
00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:06.526
and one third human and he needs

52
00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:11.526
to be whole wholly complete 360 in order to do what?

53
00:02:12.343 --> 00:02:15.230
To go through the gate of the gods and join the gods,

54
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.363
and so he goes on this quest for immortality

55
00:02:17.363 --> 00:02:19.720
to purify himself to become holy

56
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.440
so he can access the gate of the gods.

57
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.275
Then you go into the garden of Eden story,

58
00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:27.037
Adam and Eve, Eve eats of the wisdom of the serpent

59
00:02:27.037 --> 00:02:28.904
the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge,

60
00:02:28.904 --> 00:02:30.909
the Israelite god evicts Adam and Eve

61
00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.490
from the garden of Eden, how does he do that?

62
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.570
He creates a gate with cherubim

63
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.170
on either side of that gate and

64
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.122
a flaming sword in the center and

65
00:02:39.122 --> 00:02:42.268
says don't come back.

66
00:02:42.268 --> 00:02:43.388
Ever since then we've been

67
00:02:43.388 --> 00:02:45.361
looking for the secrets of that gate.

68
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:47.249
Then you go to the Tower of Babel episode

69
00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:49.318
which originally, the Tower of Babel,

70
00:02:49.318 --> 00:02:51.782
the word babel meant ladder, tower or

71
00:02:51.782 --> 00:02:53.948
stairway to heaven and once

72
00:02:53.948 --> 00:02:55.739
again humankind is at odds with

73
00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.033
the Israelite god because he decides

74
00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:00.336
"I'm not ready for company"--

75
00:03:00.336 --> 00:03:01.552
<v Voiceover>It's a harsh story.</v>

76
00:03:01.552 --> 00:03:03.322
<v ->It's an awful story in a way.</v>

77
00:03:03.322 --> 00:03:05.328
But it talks about this possibility

78
00:03:05.328 --> 00:03:07.664
of building this ladder, tower,

79
00:03:07.664 --> 00:03:10.000
or stairway to heaven and in fact after

80
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.912
Yahweh destroys that tower the Israelite

81
00:03:12.912 --> 00:03:14.778
scribes, the Hebrew scribes, changed

82
00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:16.559
the meaning of the word babel

83
00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:18.191
from it's original meaning of tower

84
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:20.059
or stairway to heaven, to it's present

85
00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:23.695
day meaning confusion, nonsense.

86
00:03:23.695 --> 00:03:27.897
Humankind accessed the gate of the gods, nonsense.

87
00:03:27.897 --> 00:03:29.711
Not a chance but that's in the

88
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:32.046
motivating story of all of humankind

89
00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:34.318
is one, that quest for immortality

90
00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:35.865
so that the benefit of that quest is

91
00:03:35.865 --> 00:03:38.222
so we can access the gate of the gods

92
00:03:38.222 --> 00:03:39.993
and today I believe we're coming

93
00:03:39.993 --> 00:03:42.286
into an era where our science is

94
00:03:42.286 --> 00:03:43.832
catching up with perhaps even the

95
00:03:43.832 --> 00:03:46.147
ancient sacred science of the gods.

96
00:03:46.147 --> 00:03:48.440
One of my keynote pieces of my

97
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.413
research is in the temples of Egypt

98
00:03:50.413 --> 00:03:53.197
where you see the gods of ancient Egypt

99
00:03:53.197 --> 00:03:56.258
on their ships of immortality, their ark

100
00:03:56.258 --> 00:03:57.795
or bark of the millions of years

101
00:03:57.795 --> 00:04:00.323
as they were called, they are unmistakably

102
00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.414
shaped and designed exactly the

103
00:04:02.414 --> 00:04:06.315
way modern science portrays a wormhole.

104
00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:07.713
And when you look at it you have

105
00:04:07.713 --> 00:04:09.057
to ask the question, is it possible that

106
00:04:09.057 --> 00:04:10.635
the ancient Egyptian gods were

107
00:04:10.635 --> 00:04:13.014
accessing these wormholes and that

108
00:04:13.014 --> 00:04:14.582
they were transforming themselves

109
00:04:14.582 --> 00:04:16.470
in preparation for riding upon

110
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.358
these ships of eternity and that

111
00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:20.853
maybe today we are catching up with

112
00:04:20.853 --> 00:04:23.744
what the ancients had already conceptualized for us.

113
00:04:23.744 --> 00:04:25.535
<v Voiceover>And interestingly intuitive</v>

114
00:04:25.535 --> 00:04:27.296
information I've been given is

115
00:04:27.296 --> 00:04:30.890
from a guiding source is that,

116
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.450
and I've said this repeatedly,

117
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.199
if you can understand the Egyptian

118
00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.108
hieroglyphics you will understand

119
00:04:37.108 --> 00:04:38.612
your future and what you're going

120
00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:41.417
and jokingly saying back to the future

121
00:04:41.417 --> 00:04:43.305
you're going to understand what you're going toward.

122
00:04:43.305 --> 00:04:46.089
Now this has been sort of bastardized

123
00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:49.278
and demonized in a lot of ways,

124
00:04:49.278 --> 00:04:51.817
that there seems to be a lot of confusion

125
00:04:51.817 --> 00:04:54.174
around whoever the controllers are

126
00:04:54.174 --> 00:04:56.050
that are keeping us small, alseep,

127
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.547
and not allowing us entrance back

128
00:04:58.547 --> 00:05:01.043
to the garden so to speak or to the stars,

129
00:05:01.043 --> 00:05:05.821
are often confused with Egyptian mythology.

130
00:05:05.821 --> 00:05:09.704
Can you start making some clarifying points here.

131
00:05:09.704 --> 00:05:11.432
<v ->Well I mean when you talk about Hollywood's</v>

132
00:05:11.432 --> 00:05:14.034
interpretation of this you go back

133
00:05:14.034 --> 00:05:15.794
to the baseline version of the story

134
00:05:15.794 --> 00:05:18.097
which is Stargate, the movie Stargate,

135
00:05:18.097 --> 00:05:20.082
and also the movie Contact.

136
00:05:20.082 --> 00:05:23.228
Carl Sagan who wrote the novel Contact

137
00:05:23.228 --> 00:05:26.257
did not believe in extraterrestrial craft.

138
00:05:26.257 --> 00:05:29.468
So he was presented with this kind

139
00:05:29.468 --> 00:05:30.876
of confused sort of questions,

140
00:05:30.876 --> 00:05:32.700
he's writing a novel about first contact

141
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.875
with an ET civilization but he doesn't believe

142
00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:37.926
in metallic craft, the distances are simply too far.

143
00:05:37.926 --> 00:05:39.259
So he hooks up with his buddy at

144
00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:41.904
Cal Tech, Kip Thorne, and they literally invent

145
00:05:41.904 --> 00:05:44.507
the idea of the traversable wormhole

146
00:05:44.507 --> 00:05:46.171
which they did a phenomenal job

147
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:47.837
in that film of conveying this,

148
00:05:47.837 --> 00:05:50.968
or establishing this idea of the wormhole.

149
00:05:50.968 --> 00:05:53.326
They build this hyper-dimensional stargate

150
00:05:53.326 --> 00:05:55.501
with this machine that has complementary

151
00:05:55.501 --> 00:05:59.075
aspects shown in ancient Egyptian mythology especially

152
00:05:59.075 --> 00:06:00.312
and then here's where I kind of

153
00:06:00.312 --> 00:06:01.528
divert from this whole story is

154
00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.831
that they literally show Jodie Foster

155
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:07.650
going through this wormhole in a bodily form

156
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.669
and that contradicts all the ancient stories

157
00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:12.931
where the ancients believed that this body

158
00:06:12.931 --> 00:06:15.223
is not going through that gate.

159
00:06:15.223 --> 00:06:16.994
<v Voiceover>No, certainly into the early</v>

160
00:06:16.994 --> 00:06:18.391
most ancient Egyptian times it's

161
00:06:18.391 --> 00:06:19.980
clear the body stays behind,

162
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.952
<v ->The body stays behind.</v>

163
00:06:20.952 --> 00:06:22.209
<v Voiceover>It's preserved and it</v>

164
00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:23.510
has different relics around it to

165
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.238
preserve it and it's connection with

166
00:06:25.238 --> 00:06:26.966
that other force but it doesn't go there.

167
00:06:26.966 --> 00:06:28.694
<v ->Right and so here is kind of</v>

168
00:06:28.694 --> 00:06:31.169
where I divert with modern, certainly Hollywood

169
00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:32.780
depictions of the gate is that they

170
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.603
have a fixation on the body, they want you

171
00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:37.142
to think that the body is all there is

172
00:06:37.142 --> 00:06:39.221
and that the body is in fact going through.

173
00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:41.408
The body is an intermediate form

174
00:06:41.408 --> 00:06:42.795
from the souls' perspective, the body

175
00:06:42.795 --> 00:06:46.549
is in like a cocoon, it's in a pupal form.

176
00:06:46.549 --> 00:06:50.047
It's meant to be transformed an transfigured.

177
00:06:50.047 --> 00:06:51.423
And so if you're thinking that

178
00:06:51.423 --> 00:06:53.418
the body is going through it you've

179
00:06:53.418 --> 00:06:54.762
got a whole different conception

180
00:06:54.762 --> 00:06:56.095
than if you're thinking wait a minute

181
00:06:56.095 --> 00:06:57.727
there's a spiritual, there's a mental,

182
00:06:57.727 --> 00:06:59.348
a physical transformation that's

183
00:06:59.348 --> 00:07:01.993
undergone preparatory to this experience.

184
00:07:01.993 --> 00:07:03.721
Now you're off on the whole, I think,

185
00:07:03.721 --> 00:07:07.413
the true path towards accessing the gates of the gods.

186
00:07:07.413 --> 00:07:08.393
<v Voiceover>And let's talk about that.</v>

187
00:07:08.393 --> 00:07:10.846
Why do we need to know about this right now?

188
00:07:10.846 --> 00:07:12.819
Why do we need to begin this exploration?

189
00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:16.190
<v ->Well I mean part of it is about the time cycle</v>

190
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.920
so many point to 2012 as this special time

191
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.176
where this is coming around.

192
00:07:20.176 --> 00:07:21.125
<v Voiceover>And Alexander Sitchin says</v>

193
00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:24.346
2087 maybe even 2100, somewhere

194
00:07:24.346 --> 00:07:26.874
in this general vicinity
<v ->Right.</v>

195
00:07:26.874 --> 00:07:29.658
I just think it's part of a
<v Voiceover>I mean Zecharia.</v>

196
00:07:29.658 --> 00:07:32.314
<v ->Zecheria Sitchin right. It's a whole movement</v>

197
00:07:32.314 --> 00:07:34.756
in human consciousness right now,

198
00:07:34.756 --> 00:07:36.239
Steven Spielberg has a new movie

199
00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:37.987
coming out timed for 2012, it's called

200
00:07:37.987 --> 00:07:41.230
Interstellar, subject wormholes.

201
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.225
It just seems like now is the time

202
00:07:43.225 --> 00:07:44.825
that we want to start accessing this

203
00:07:44.825 --> 00:07:46.595
because indeed I think the reason

204
00:07:46.595 --> 00:07:48.408
why we're so compelled to do that

205
00:07:48.408 --> 00:07:50.659
is that we look back at ancient Egyptian

206
00:07:50.659 --> 00:07:53.422
civilization, totally green, when you

207
00:07:53.422 --> 00:07:54.744
look back at the technologies of

208
00:07:54.744 --> 00:07:56.568
how they could move a 250 ton block

209
00:07:56.568 --> 00:07:58.925
of red granite, and how they left

210
00:07:58.925 --> 00:08:00.920
the carbon footprint of Egypt is,

211
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.508
they don't have one, it's because

212
00:08:02.508 --> 00:08:04.173
they had green technology.

213
00:08:04.173 --> 00:08:06.145
And if we can access these ideas

214
00:08:06.145 --> 00:08:09.207
we too can transform our civilization.

215
00:08:09.207 --> 00:08:12.194
And researchers like Dr. Michio Kaku

216
00:08:12.194 --> 00:08:14.188
even point to the idea of the stargate

217
00:08:14.188 --> 00:08:17.665
or wormhole as a symbol of our salvation itself.

218
00:08:17.665 --> 00:08:20.342
That if we can leap out of our type zero

219
00:08:20.342 --> 00:08:23.393
civilization he thinks we're a long

220
00:08:23.393 --> 00:08:25.078
ways away from even the next level

221
00:08:25.078 --> 00:08:27.062
which he refers to as type one,

222
00:08:27.062 --> 00:08:30.475
let alone getting up to a stargate traveling civilization.

223
00:08:30.475 --> 00:08:32.352
Still if we can climb that ladder

224
00:08:32.352 --> 00:08:34.379
or stairway in this way and start

225
00:08:34.379 --> 00:08:37.163
to access these ideas that transforms

226
00:08:37.163 --> 00:08:39.211
our civilization and I think just by

227
00:08:39.211 --> 00:08:41.003
virtue of being able to look at

228
00:08:41.003 --> 00:08:42.752
this ancient symbolism and even

229
00:08:42.752 --> 00:08:44.522
comprehend what we're seeing from

230
00:08:44.522 --> 00:08:46.549
a stargate perspective we must be

231
00:08:46.549 --> 00:08:48.725
a whole lot closer to being able to access that

232
00:08:48.725 --> 00:08:51.572
than even Dr. Kaku suggests.

233
00:08:51.572 --> 00:08:53.278
<v Voiceover>I think you're right about that,</v>

234
00:08:53.278 --> 00:08:56.468
that feels right to me and this

235
00:08:56.468 --> 00:09:00.287
is a leap of consciousness and certainly it

236
00:09:00.287 --> 00:09:02.442
seems that we're seeing evidence of

237
00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:04.532
leaps of consciousness around us every day.

238
00:09:04.532 --> 00:09:06.398
<v ->Everyday, absolutely, knowledge</v>

239
00:09:06.398 --> 00:09:09.630
is doubling and these ideas are now

240
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.881
coming into mainstream consciousness

241
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:13.330
and so that's gonna have just a

242
00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.009
profound transformative effect on us I think

243
00:09:16.009 --> 00:09:17.800
because people are gonna start to get this idea,

244
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.731
you know we're all raised with this idea

245
00:09:19.731 --> 00:09:22.621
if you wanna make something happen in your life

246
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:25.000
that first you get the idea for inspiration

247
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.657
then you have to put a whole lot of effort into it

248
00:09:27.657 --> 00:09:29.830
and then ultimately you can manifest it.

249
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:30.982
Well now what we're beginning to

250
00:09:30.982 --> 00:09:33.851
recognize is that time factor and the effort

251
00:09:33.851 --> 00:09:36.411
factor is starting to collapse

252
00:09:36.411 --> 00:09:38.747
and it's really more about our emotion

253
00:09:38.747 --> 00:09:41.915
and what we put into it in terms of being able to manifest.

254
00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:42.970
And that goes right along with

255
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.357
the whole stargate idea because

256
00:09:44.357 --> 00:09:47.609
only beings of pure love are going through those gateways.

257
00:09:47.609 --> 00:09:49.477
This is where I kind of differ with

258
00:09:49.477 --> 00:09:51.034
a lot of folks who are saying the military

259
00:09:51.034 --> 00:09:52.335
has this technology and it's all

260
00:09:52.335 --> 00:09:54.191
hardware based and all of this and

261
00:09:54.191 --> 00:09:57.208
I'm like you know what I'm not so sure about this.

262
00:09:57.208 --> 00:09:58.384
<v Voiceover>Yeah it's interesting because</v>

263
00:09:58.384 --> 00:10:00.272
they're really looking at it more from

264
00:10:00.272 --> 00:10:03.333
like the Looking Glass Project, more from

265
00:10:03.333 --> 00:10:06.245
the point of view of being able to

266
00:10:06.245 --> 00:10:09.125
shift consciousness beyond the

267
00:10:09.125 --> 00:10:12.378
time space continuum for military advantage,

268
00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:15.343
i.e. looking into the future, how are things playing out

269
00:10:15.343 --> 00:10:18.916
and Dan Barish I was watching an interview

270
00:10:18.916 --> 00:10:22.437
with him and he was saying that there are

271
00:10:22.437 --> 00:10:24.655
actually very few people even at the highest

272
00:10:24.655 --> 00:10:28.976
levels who actually know how to utilize this technology.

273
00:10:28.976 --> 00:10:30.669
Now who knows if it's hardware based

274
00:10:30.669 --> 00:10:32.387
or it's pure consciousness but they

275
00:10:32.387 --> 00:10:35.862
utilize certain places on the planet to do this.

276
00:10:35.862 --> 00:10:37.803
One of them apparently is Sedona Arizona

277
00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:39.553
where I lived for many years which

278
00:10:39.553 --> 00:10:42.091
has a very interesting kind of lineage

279
00:10:42.091 --> 00:10:43.616
because there are underground military

280
00:10:43.616 --> 00:10:45.686
bases all around it which would lend

281
00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:47.680
some credibility to the fact they're

282
00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.667
trying to use that vortex energy but

283
00:10:50.667 --> 00:10:53.227
not for ascension
<v ->Right. Right.</v>

284
00:10:53.227 --> 00:10:55.968
<v Voiceover>Ascension being an interesting word in itself</v>

285
00:10:55.968 --> 00:10:58.645
<v ->Right, right, I mean it's interesting</v>

286
00:10:58.645 --> 00:11:00.031
the corollaries in ancient Egypt

287
00:11:00.031 --> 00:11:01.898
there's a temple called Abydos

288
00:11:01.898 --> 00:11:05.023
it was built by Seti, who came into Egypt

289
00:11:05.023 --> 00:11:06.975
in the 19th dynasty right after

290
00:11:06.975 --> 00:11:08.809
the time of chaos of Akhenaten

291
00:11:08.809 --> 00:11:10.089
who had launched this religious

292
00:11:10.089 --> 00:11:13.844
revolution that spun Egypt into just total chaos.

293
00:11:13.844 --> 00:11:16.586
Seti's a military man but at the same time

294
00:11:16.586 --> 00:11:18.206
when you go into the Osiris chapel

295
00:11:18.206 --> 00:11:19.710
in his temple at Abydos you see this

296
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.782
device called the Osiris device that

297
00:11:22.782 --> 00:11:25.278
looks basically like, imagine the biblical

298
00:11:25.278 --> 00:11:27.987
Ark of the Covenant with a pillar attached to it

299
00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:30.348
and the depiction as it's shown

300
00:11:30.348 --> 00:11:31.623
looks like this device might have

301
00:11:31.623 --> 00:11:34.856
been around 100 to 180 feet tall

302
00:11:34.856 --> 00:11:37.640
perhaps even having a telescopic ability.

303
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.228
I call it the Osiris device because

304
00:11:39.228 --> 00:11:43.497
the word device means a tool, an appliance

305
00:11:43.497 --> 00:11:45.627
but it also means a symbol.

306
00:11:45.627 --> 00:11:48.474
So this Osiris device is literally the symbol,

307
00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:50.780
they called it the Tower, the bond

308
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.262
between heaven and earth and

309
00:11:52.262 --> 00:11:54.352
there are in fact scholars that believe

310
00:11:54.352 --> 00:11:57.069
David Rohl is a British anthropologist,

311
00:11:57.069 --> 00:11:58.958
or archaeologist who believes that

312
00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.614
the Osiris device at Abydos is in fact

313
00:12:01.614 --> 00:12:05.389
the true representation of the Tower of Babel.

314
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:07.715
So you see this device on one wall

315
00:12:07.715 --> 00:12:11.085
then on the opposite wall you see Seti

316
00:12:11.085 --> 00:12:14.455
who has now become the device, his face

317
00:12:14.455 --> 00:12:16.546
is literally poking out from it,

318
00:12:16.546 --> 00:12:18.253
it's the same platform but now

319
00:12:18.253 --> 00:12:21.814
attached to it is this wormhole shaped boat,

320
00:12:21.814 --> 00:12:24.150
the Ship of Eternity and the message that

321
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.263
I take from that is that Seti understands

322
00:12:26.263 --> 00:12:29.169
that there is no device out here,

323
00:12:29.169 --> 00:12:31.286
this is the device, the human body

324
00:12:31.286 --> 00:12:33.601
is the device and he learned the

325
00:12:33.601 --> 00:12:36.182
process that in Christianity is called ascension

326
00:12:36.182 --> 00:12:39.265
and resurrection and transformed his body

327
00:12:39.265 --> 00:12:42.134
preparatory to going through that wormhole.

328
00:12:42.134 --> 00:12:44.224
And now there are stories like the Search

329
00:12:44.224 --> 00:12:46.869
for Omm Sety is a famous story about

330
00:12:46.869 --> 00:12:48.469
a woman who encounters Seti and

331
00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:50.219
talks about how he can toggle back

332
00:12:50.219 --> 00:12:52.224
and forth between earth and what's

333
00:12:52.224 --> 00:12:55.434
referred to as the field or dimension of the blessed.

334
00:12:55.434 --> 00:12:57.119
<v Voiceover>Right and some of those symbols</v>

335
00:12:57.119 --> 00:12:59.829
in Egyptology are literally one of the most

336
00:12:59.829 --> 00:13:02.591
famous ones is actually misunderstood

337
00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:04.767
in it's common definition is actually

338
00:13:04.767 --> 00:13:08.116
a portal between dimensions.
<v ->Yeah absolutely.</v>

339
00:13:08.116 --> 00:13:10.110
And so the Seti temple is located

340
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.223
right beside one of Egypt's oldest temple

341
00:13:12.223 --> 00:13:14.964
sites the Osirion which researchers

342
00:13:14.964 --> 00:13:16.873
like John Anthony West think might be

343
00:13:16.873 --> 00:13:19.027
as old as 12 thousand years old.

344
00:13:19.027 --> 00:13:20.126
So we're talking possibly this

345
00:13:20.126 --> 00:13:22.110
is pre-Egyptian technology--
<v Voiceover>He said</v>

346
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.693
even as much some of these artifacts

347
00:13:25.693 --> 00:13:28.371
are even as much as 35 thousand years old.

348
00:13:28.371 --> 00:13:29.587
<v ->I believe it.
<v Voiceover>He said it</v>

349
00:13:29.587 --> 00:13:31.539
on camera too.
<v ->I believe it.</v>

350
00:13:31.539 --> 00:13:33.107
And so part of what my work is about

351
00:13:33.107 --> 00:13:34.792
is to say, well okay if what

352
00:13:34.792 --> 00:13:35.825
we're talking about here with the

353
00:13:35.825 --> 00:13:38.146
Osiris device is a particle accelerator

354
00:13:38.146 --> 00:13:41.516
or a scanner you know it's a stargate

355
00:13:41.516 --> 00:13:44.182
or excuse me it's a Star Trek transporter device

356
00:13:44.182 --> 00:13:45.963
that's just literally scanning his body

357
00:13:45.963 --> 00:13:47.147
and then reassembling, that's the

358
00:13:47.147 --> 00:13:48.747
whole Osiris story isn't it?

359
00:13:48.747 --> 00:13:50.944
Osiris as the king who his body's

360
00:13:50.944 --> 00:13:52.993
disassembled and then re-assembled

361
00:13:52.993 --> 00:13:54.784
at another time and place, I mean

362
00:13:54.784 --> 00:13:57.226
we think of that today, that's a transporter technology.

363
00:13:57.226 --> 00:13:59.456
I've collected examples, the Cathars

364
00:13:59.456 --> 00:14:01.386
of southern France, Hieronymus Bosch

365
00:14:01.386 --> 00:14:03.338
is a famous painter whose believed

366
00:14:03.338 --> 00:14:05.918
to have encoded the Cathar secrets

367
00:14:05.918 --> 00:14:07.764
of transfiguration and in one of

368
00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:10.003
his famous paintings he shows that it's the,

369
00:14:10.003 --> 00:14:12.989
it's a a painting called Saint Jerome Praying,

370
00:14:12.989 --> 00:14:15.207
and in the painting you see Saint Jerome

371
00:14:15.207 --> 00:14:16.914
over here worshiping the traditional

372
00:14:16.914 --> 00:14:19.005
image of the crucifix with the crucified

373
00:14:19.005 --> 00:14:21.435
Jesus on the Cross, and back over here

374
00:14:21.435 --> 00:14:25.605
Hieronymus Bosch shows the Cathar version of the Cross

375
00:14:25.605 --> 00:14:27.962
which they call the Pillar of Christ

376
00:14:27.962 --> 00:14:30.725
and what it shows is this glassy column

377
00:14:30.725 --> 00:14:33.327
filled with stars with a Cathar's soul

378
00:14:33.327 --> 00:14:35.194
that's in a light being form ascending

379
00:14:35.194 --> 00:14:39.034
through this Pillar into a higher dimension

380
00:14:39.034 --> 00:14:41.529
okay and so--
<v Voiceover>Better story</v>

381
00:14:41.529 --> 00:14:43.279
by the way.
<v ->Exactly.</v>

382
00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:45.230
And it's the whole idea, and of course the Catholic

383
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.238
Church wiped out as many as a million people

384
00:14:48.238 --> 00:14:51.182
to keep the story from being told

385
00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:52.931
because there is an element on this planet

386
00:14:52.931 --> 00:14:55.161
that does not want us to know that

387
00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:57.219
hey we can transform ourselves.

388
00:14:57.219 --> 00:14:58.414
<v Voiceover>And then the Cathars,</v>

389
00:14:58.414 --> 00:14:59.599
I mean a lot of the information that

390
00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:01.016
they possess was really coming from

391
00:15:01.016 --> 00:15:03.896
Sumerian times too, ancient, ancient times.

392
00:15:03.896 --> 00:15:05.709
<v ->Absolutely through Jesus as the bridge,</v>

393
00:15:05.709 --> 00:15:07.553
Jesus and Mary Magdalene being the bridge,

394
00:15:07.553 --> 00:15:10.166
and it was purely a symbolic religion

395
00:15:10.166 --> 00:15:12.662
that was transmitted to them, it was oral

396
00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:15.125
there was no books it was all in images

397
00:15:15.125 --> 00:15:16.887
and that's a key part of this is

398
00:15:16.887 --> 00:15:19.062
that they've left us these images

399
00:15:19.062 --> 00:15:21.504
of transformation and transfiguration

400
00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:24.405
and in sayings that the image itself

401
00:15:24.405 --> 00:15:26.218
will show you the way and so when

402
00:15:26.218 --> 00:15:27.477
you're looking at whether it's

403
00:15:27.477 --> 00:15:29.140
<v Voiceover>The symbols.</v>
<v ->the Osiris device--</v>

404
00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.400
the symbols exactly.

405
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.403
<v Voiceover>It's interesting because</v>

406
00:15:31.403 --> 00:15:32.800
the people that I know that have

407
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.272
done some very very deep work

408
00:15:34.272 --> 00:15:36.097
and what one would call journeying

409
00:15:36.097 --> 00:15:38.635
the pathway is always symbols and

410
00:15:38.635 --> 00:15:40.682
the sequence of symbols to be able

411
00:15:40.682 --> 00:15:42.037
to move between the dimensions

412
00:15:42.037 --> 00:15:43.583
and this is something that's rarely done.

413
00:15:43.583 --> 00:15:45.344
I mean rarely rarely done.
<v ->Yeah I know.</v>

414
00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:47.520
I started working on this with icons,

415
00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.791
the traditional, the orthodox images

416
00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:52.052
of Jesus and his transfiguration

417
00:15:52.052 --> 00:15:53.428
when he takes the disciples up to

418
00:15:53.428 --> 00:15:54.954
the top of the mountain and reveals

419
00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.247
himself as a being of light over and

420
00:15:57.247 --> 00:15:59.101
again these icons show Jesus

421
00:15:59.101 --> 00:16:01.031
in his bright white clothing, symbolic

422
00:16:01.031 --> 00:16:02.898
of the light body, with Moses and

423
00:16:02.898 --> 00:16:04.242
Elijah on either side who suddenly

424
00:16:04.242 --> 00:16:06.620
manifested during this episode

425
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.284
and they always show him in front

426
00:16:08.284 --> 00:16:10.780
of this open gateway, often the

427
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.913
gateway has either a star in it

428
00:16:12.913 --> 00:16:15.089
or concentric rings, and the idea

429
00:16:15.089 --> 00:16:16.678
is is that it's showing a two step

430
00:16:16.678 --> 00:16:19.761
process here, he opens up the light body

431
00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:20.977
and then the light body knows how

432
00:16:20.977 --> 00:16:22.544
to open up that stargate because

433
00:16:22.544 --> 00:16:24.187
that's what that is.

434
00:16:24.187 --> 00:16:25.755
And so the belief that goes along

435
00:16:25.755 --> 00:16:28.101
with these icons is the that

436
00:16:28.101 --> 00:16:30.312
it encodes all of the information

437
00:16:30.312 --> 00:16:32.850
to transfigure your body , the image,

438
00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.047
the icon will show you the way.

439
00:16:35.047 --> 00:16:37.224
Enter through the image, these

440
00:16:37.224 --> 00:16:39.110
are the instructions and the idea is,

441
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.180
and they've shown this with stigmatics,

442
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.089
people, a friend of mine Dr. Mario Martinez

443
00:16:43.089 --> 00:16:45.222
has studied stigmatics for the Vatican

444
00:16:45.222 --> 00:16:47.057
and he cites an example of a woman

445
00:16:47.057 --> 00:16:50.289
in California who exemplified the stigmatic marks

446
00:16:50.289 --> 00:16:54.352
after obsessively reading about the Crucifixion.

447
00:16:54.352 --> 00:16:55.771
And what he shows is that this

448
00:16:55.771 --> 00:16:57.573
stuff, it's hardwired in our body,

449
00:16:57.573 --> 00:16:59.898
what we need is the image or the idea

450
00:16:59.898 --> 00:17:02.064
that will trigger it because our body

451
00:17:02.064 --> 00:17:04.367
knows how to do this and so with

452
00:17:04.367 --> 00:17:06.149
the icons if you can connect with them

453
00:17:06.149 --> 00:17:07.759
mentally, physically, spiritually, and

454
00:17:07.759 --> 00:17:10.277
emotionally on a deep level your body

455
00:17:10.277 --> 00:17:13.263
then will begin to take on exactly

456
00:17:13.263 --> 00:17:15.439
the same feelings that Jesus was experiencing

457
00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:17.913
during that transfiguration and that's

458
00:17:17.913 --> 00:17:20.431
how the secret is transmitted, it's incredible.

459
00:17:20.431 --> 00:17:21.614
<v Voiceover>And isn't it really,</v>

460
00:17:21.614 --> 00:17:22.852
this is a journey of remembering.

461
00:17:22.852 --> 00:17:25.050
If we're going to be looking at

462
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.182
the whole notion of stargates and portals

463
00:17:27.182 --> 00:17:29.539
something happened a very long time ago

464
00:17:29.539 --> 00:17:33.217
and the beings here are intrinsically illuminated.

465
00:17:33.217 --> 00:17:36.992
And there are many different, what is the word

466
00:17:36.992 --> 00:17:40.106
I'm looking for, not just ancient texts but beyond

467
00:17:40.106 --> 00:17:42.944
that indicate that we are an illuminated

468
00:17:42.944 --> 00:17:44.917
species by nature who for some

469
00:17:44.917 --> 00:17:47.167
reason had some wet and dirty towels

470
00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:48.778
thrown over the whole thing
<v ->That's right.</v>

471
00:17:48.778 --> 00:17:50.101
<v Voiceover>You have to peel them</v>

472
00:17:50.101 --> 00:17:51.401
back to remember who we are.
<v ->Right.</v>

473
00:17:51.401 --> 00:17:52.959
Whether or not it's a race of beings that,

474
00:17:52.959 --> 00:17:55.402
harvesting energy from our body or whatever,

475
00:17:55.402 --> 00:17:56.575
for whatever reason they've created

476
00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:58.431
a prison planet, they have done it.

477
00:17:58.431 --> 00:18:00.276
I try to remain neutral with it

478
00:18:00.276 --> 00:18:01.620
and think well okay this really

479
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.234
isn't for everybody so let's just

480
00:18:04.234 --> 00:18:06.164
protect the people by keeping them

481
00:18:06.164 --> 00:18:07.465
kind of cloaked in darkness and then

482
00:18:07.465 --> 00:18:09.726
when they wake up then they can access it.

483
00:18:09.726 --> 00:18:10.804
<v Voiceover>But we're all waking up now.</v>

484
00:18:10.804 --> 00:18:11.955
<v ->Exactly.
<v Voiceover>This is the time</v>

485
00:18:11.955 --> 00:18:13.459
of the awakening, the reawakening.

486
00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:15.027
<v ->That's right, right.
<v Voiceover>We've been</v>

487
00:18:15.027 --> 00:18:16.403
through this before as a species.

488
00:18:16.403 --> 00:18:19.635
<v ->Right, the graduation.
<v Voiceover>And</v>

489
00:18:19.635 --> 00:18:21.789
unfortunately a lot of the beings who

490
00:18:21.789 --> 00:18:23.826
have controlled the scene, again

491
00:18:23.826 --> 00:18:26.280
wanna keep the war games playing out,

492
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.477
to keep the fear going because fear keeps us

493
00:18:28.477 --> 00:18:30.973
from the exploration of all of this.

494
00:18:30.973 --> 00:18:33.874
And let's talk about stargates and

495
00:18:33.874 --> 00:18:35.623
start making the link through Iraq

496
00:18:35.623 --> 00:18:37.394
because I have also read that there

497
00:18:37.394 --> 00:18:40.092
are stargates in Iraq and Saddam Hussein

498
00:18:40.092 --> 00:18:41.980
what is this story about because

499
00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:45.297
it adds a complexity perhaps to even why we're there.

500
00:18:45.297 --> 00:18:47.088
<v ->Right I agree I started following</v>

501
00:18:47.088 --> 00:18:48.956
the whole Saddam stargate story

502
00:18:48.956 --> 00:18:51.719
in 1991 during the first Gulf War

503
00:18:51.719 --> 00:18:53.585
when it became public knowledge

504
00:18:53.585 --> 00:18:56.144
that Saddam made it very clear that

505
00:18:56.144 --> 00:18:57.830
he believed he was the reincarnated

506
00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:00.123
biblical king Nebuchadnezzar and

507
00:19:00.123 --> 00:19:02.447
in fact all of his efforts were

508
00:19:02.447 --> 00:19:05.530
all about duplicating what Nebuchadnezzar

509
00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:10.160
had done during his lifetime, which is around 800 BC.

510
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.463
Key point Nebuchadnezzar in turn

511
00:19:12.463 --> 00:19:14.820
believed he was the reincarnated Nimrod

512
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.538
who built the Tower of Babel.

513
00:19:16.538 --> 00:19:19.099
<v Voiceover>Interesting and we need to understand</v>

514
00:19:19.099 --> 00:19:22.148
that Sumeria the deep ancient texts

515
00:19:22.148 --> 00:19:24.697
the Cradle of all this is Iraq.

516
00:19:24.697 --> 00:19:27.641
<v ->Absolutely Cradle of Civilization, right.</v>

517
00:19:27.641 --> 00:19:29.774
So I start following this in 91

518
00:19:29.774 --> 00:19:31.812
and then we get up to 98 where

519
00:19:31.812 --> 00:19:33.817
all of a sudden Saddam is building

520
00:19:33.817 --> 00:19:35.363
what I describe as a Disneyland

521
00:19:35.363 --> 00:19:38.030
for the Annunaki in Baghdad, he is

522
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:40.014
assembling all of these ancient

523
00:19:40.014 --> 00:19:43.572
texts, cylinder seals, tablets, everything he can

524
00:19:43.572 --> 00:19:45.386
and I start watching the art newspapers

525
00:19:45.386 --> 00:19:46.770
the international art newspapers

526
00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:47.730
because these guys are saying,

527
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.301
"Well wait a minute all these UN weapons inspectors?

528
00:19:50.301 --> 00:19:51.952
"These a bunch of frauds, these guys are

529
00:19:51.952 --> 00:19:52.987
"going into Iraq they're coming out

530
00:19:52.987 --> 00:19:55.237
"with their pockets full of ancient Iraqi artifacts."

531
00:19:55.237 --> 00:19:56.258
Cylinder seals, they're selling them

532
00:19:56.258 --> 00:19:57.634
on the black market.
<v Voiceover>You're kidding.</v>

533
00:19:57.634 --> 00:20:00.385
<v ->No and so it's like watch these guys,</v>

534
00:20:00.385 --> 00:20:01.901
and the art people are saying,

535
00:20:01.901 --> 00:20:03.575
"Hands off this stuff these are,

536
00:20:03.575 --> 00:20:05.740
"this is Iraq's cultural heritage."

537
00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.127
These people are saying they're

538
00:20:07.127 --> 00:20:09.100
weapons inspectors, they're not.

539
00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.903
But look at what Saddam's doing,

540
00:20:10.903 --> 00:20:13.164
he's contacting the Berlin museum

541
00:20:13.164 --> 00:20:16.395
saying, "You all came in here in the 1860's

542
00:20:16.395 --> 00:20:18.582
" took the Ishtar gate from Babylon,

543
00:20:18.582 --> 00:20:20.470
"we want it back, I'm creating,

544
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.424
"I want to stimulate Iraqi tourism."

545
00:20:23.424 --> 00:20:26.144
<v Voiceover>And in Munich--</v>
<v ->Berlin.</v>

546
00:20:26.144 --> 00:20:28.438
<v Voiceover>I mean in Berlin they do have</v>

547
00:20:28.438 --> 00:20:30.432
<v ->They have it.
<v Voiceover>Cylinder seals.</v>

548
00:20:30.432 --> 00:20:31.595
<v ->And he asked them to return that.</v>

549
00:20:31.595 --> 00:20:34.197
He called the British Museum, not Saddam

550
00:20:34.197 --> 00:20:35.701
personally but his archaeologist did

551
00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:37.450
and said, "Y'all came in here

552
00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:40.287
"and you've got stuff still crated up

553
00:20:40.287 --> 00:20:41.855
"in the basement of the British Museum,

554
00:20:41.855 --> 00:20:45.183
"that you've not even cataloged, I want it back,

555
00:20:45.183 --> 00:20:47.466
"because we are creating a cultural center."

556
00:20:47.466 --> 00:20:48.660
Sort of like what Hitler did--

557
00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:49.535
<v Voiceover>It would have been the</v>

558
00:20:49.535 --> 00:20:50.473
most magnificent cultural center

559
00:20:50.473 --> 00:20:52.179
in existence.
<v ->Unbelievable.</v>

560
00:20:52.179 --> 00:20:54.963
He was assembling this just massive

561
00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:56.500
massive amount of knowledge about

562
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.038
ancient Iraq, the true history of the world.

563
00:20:59.038 --> 00:21:00.404
As I'm looking at that then all of a sudden

564
00:21:00.404 --> 00:21:01.726
they start talking about weapons of

565
00:21:01.726 --> 00:21:04.105
mass destruction, it's like yeah,

566
00:21:04.105 --> 00:21:07.251
they're in little lipstick size cylinder seals

567
00:21:07.251 --> 00:21:09.118
that talk about our history and

568
00:21:09.118 --> 00:21:10.846
interaction with the gods and if

569
00:21:10.846 --> 00:21:13.181
Saddam gets this happening he's

570
00:21:13.181 --> 00:21:14.621
just gonna pull the rug right out

571
00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:17.021
underneath Judaism and Christianity because

572
00:21:17.021 --> 00:21:19.431
he's gonna show that those religions

573
00:21:19.431 --> 00:21:21.257
they're just totally built on sand

574
00:21:21.257 --> 00:21:23.230
and what he's got is the true history

575
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:24.466
of the human race.

576
00:21:24.466 --> 00:21:25.341
<v Voiceover>Please explain to</v>

577
00:21:25.341 --> 00:21:26.578
everybody what cylinder seals are.

578
00:21:26.578 --> 00:21:30.643
<v ->Cylinder seals are little crystal cylinders,</v>

579
00:21:30.643 --> 00:21:32.530
they're about the size of a tube of lipstick

580
00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.804
and etched on them are astonishing scenes

581
00:21:35.804 --> 00:21:39.153
of the gods interacting with humankind.

582
00:21:39.153 --> 00:21:40.998
The most interesting ones to me

583
00:21:40.998 --> 00:21:42.652
are the ones that show the gods

584
00:21:42.652 --> 00:21:45.755
in their winged craft, their winged disc,

585
00:21:45.755 --> 00:21:47.441
their winged rings, these aren't UFOs

586
00:21:47.441 --> 00:21:49.595
these are called Merkaba vehicles,

587
00:21:49.595 --> 00:21:51.568
space-time light vehicles and you

588
00:21:51.568 --> 00:21:53.596
see other examples of technology

589
00:21:53.596 --> 00:21:55.301
you see them, you see towers in

590
00:21:55.301 --> 00:21:57.829
these depictions, they're absolutely stunning.

591
00:21:57.829 --> 00:22:00.464
And these are the ones that are in public view,

592
00:22:00.464 --> 00:22:04.304
we have no idea the true complexity

593
00:22:04.304 --> 00:22:06.342
of what Saddam was probably digging up

594
00:22:06.342 --> 00:22:08.068
because he was going back into all

595
00:22:08.068 --> 00:22:10.341
these archaeological sites and bringing

596
00:22:10.341 --> 00:22:12.090
all this stuff forward and with the

597
00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:15.151
intention, he wanted the world to come to Baghdad,

598
00:22:15.151 --> 00:22:17.294
to come to this Disneyland for the Annunaki ,

599
00:22:17.294 --> 00:22:20.089
the ancient Egyptian or excuse me the ancient Sumerian gods

600
00:22:20.089 --> 00:22:24.805
and explore this ancient heritage, it's astonishing.

601
00:22:24.805 --> 00:22:26.062
<v Voiceover>This is very interesting</v>

602
00:22:26.062 --> 00:22:28.570
because if you start tracing it back

603
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.246
the archenemies of Saddam Hussein

604
00:22:31.246 --> 00:22:32.430
are the Bushes
<v ->That's right.</v>

605
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:33.464
<v Voiceover>and the Bushes go back</v>

606
00:22:33.464 --> 00:22:35.224
through the Bavarian, they go back in

607
00:22:35.224 --> 00:22:38.659
to the Sumerian understandings and so forth

608
00:22:38.659 --> 00:22:39.779
<v ->Right
<v Voiceover>But bringing</v>

609
00:22:39.779 --> 00:22:41.080
it forth many would say kind of on

610
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.010
the dark side shall we say.
<v ->Right right.</v>

611
00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.981
<v Voiceover>And so these are</v>

612
00:22:43.981 --> 00:22:47.416
almost historical archenemies it appears.

613
00:22:47.416 --> 00:22:48.578
<v ->Absolutely.
<v Voiceover>Intuitively</v>

614
00:22:48.578 --> 00:22:50.423
it feels like that to me.
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

615
00:22:50.423 --> 00:22:52.375
And I'm not saying Saddam's a nice guy

616
00:22:52.375 --> 00:22:53.655
I am saying what he's doing is

617
00:22:53.655 --> 00:22:55.767
what Hitler did, Hitler had a college

618
00:22:55.767 --> 00:22:57.804
for study of ruins that he was,

619
00:22:57.804 --> 00:22:59.873
at Weblesberg which is a sort of

620
00:22:59.873 --> 00:23:01.943
Grail castle, they had the largest

621
00:23:01.943 --> 00:23:04.972
collection of books on the Holy Grail,

622
00:23:04.972 --> 00:23:06.679
ancient Atlantis, all of these

623
00:23:06.679 --> 00:23:08.366
myths and folklore, anything that

624
00:23:08.366 --> 00:23:11.030
had to do with especially portals.

625
00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:12.715
<v Voiceover>They've been confiscated?</v>

626
00:23:12.715 --> 00:23:14.358
<v ->Right absolutely, all that's in,</v>

627
00:23:14.358 --> 00:23:16.064
the CIAs got all that now.
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

628
00:23:16.064 --> 00:23:18.422
<v ->But so here comes the Iraq stargate story,</v>

629
00:23:18.422 --> 00:23:20.021
a lot of people talk about that,

630
00:23:20.021 --> 00:23:22.688
I was the one that really broke that story

631
00:23:22.688 --> 00:23:24.662
because the basis for it actually

632
00:23:24.662 --> 00:23:26.645
comes from recognizing and getting

633
00:23:26.645 --> 00:23:28.116
into Saddam's head and saying,

634
00:23:28.116 --> 00:23:30.549
"Okay, he believes he's Nebuchadnezzar."

635
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:32.906
He spent over 300 million dollars,

636
00:23:32.906 --> 00:23:35.199
some say it's as much as 500 million dollars

637
00:23:35.199 --> 00:23:38.538
in the 1980s rebuilding Babylon.

638
00:23:38.538 --> 00:23:40.244
Bible prophecy says that in order

639
00:23:40.244 --> 00:23:42.314
for the Lord to return Babylon

640
00:23:42.314 --> 00:23:43.935
has to be rebuilt so that it can

641
00:23:43.935 --> 00:23:47.390
be destroyed and then the Lord appears.

642
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:48.490
So this is, put you in the head

643
00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:50.377
of George W. Bush and the Born Again's

644
00:23:50.377 --> 00:23:52.286
and the neocon's who are literally

645
00:23:52.286 --> 00:23:54.121
looking at this and reading the book

646
00:23:54.121 --> 00:23:55.699
of Revelation and this other prophecy

647
00:23:55.699 --> 00:23:58.931
as a to do list, this is what they have to make happen.

648
00:23:58.931 --> 00:24:00.500
So Saddam is doing all this stuff

649
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.749
in the belief that he's Nebuchadnezzar

650
00:24:02.749 --> 00:24:04.616
and he's making it clear that he believes

651
00:24:04.616 --> 00:24:06.451
he is Nebuchadnezzar and he's going

652
00:24:06.451 --> 00:24:09.011
to duplicate and in fact maybe even outdo

653
00:24:09.011 --> 00:24:11.891
the accomplishments of Nebuchadnezzar.

654
00:24:11.891 --> 00:24:14.962
Well what was Nebuchadnezzar's great accomplishment?

655
00:24:14.962 --> 00:24:17.117
Well what happens is is that in the book

656
00:24:17.117 --> 00:24:18.759
of Daniel we're told that he's got

657
00:24:18.759 --> 00:24:21.587
this golden image of the Beast

658
00:24:21.587 --> 00:24:23.196
and he's got this other contraption

659
00:24:23.196 --> 00:24:25.532
out on the plain of Dura that stands

660
00:24:25.532 --> 00:24:29.414
about 180 feet tall but he can't make it work.

661
00:24:29.414 --> 00:24:32.198
He's tried singing, dancing, clapping,

662
00:24:32.198 --> 00:24:33.735
all these other types of things

663
00:24:33.735 --> 00:24:35.366
to get this thing to operate and

664
00:24:35.366 --> 00:24:37.051
he can't make it happen but he

665
00:24:37.051 --> 00:24:38.737
knows that the wise men in the

666
00:24:38.737 --> 00:24:40.912
Temple of Solomon in nearby Jerusalem

667
00:24:40.912 --> 00:24:44.807
have the software to make this hardware device work.

668
00:24:44.807 --> 00:24:46.395
So Nebuchadnezzar marches into

669
00:24:46.395 --> 00:24:48.261
Jerusalem loots and levels the

670
00:24:48.261 --> 00:24:50.373
Temple of Solomon, brings the Jews

671
00:24:50.373 --> 00:24:53.424
into Babylonian captivity back to Babylon,

672
00:24:53.424 --> 00:24:55.514
including Ezekiel, including three

673
00:24:55.514 --> 00:24:57.487
wise men from the Temple of Solomon

674
00:24:57.487 --> 00:25:00.367
named Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

675
00:25:00.367 --> 00:25:03.706
And what happens is he brings them together

676
00:25:03.706 --> 00:25:07.435
and says, "Okay I've got this fiery furnace here

677
00:25:07.435 --> 00:25:09.414
"and I can't make it work and I've got

678
00:25:09.414 --> 00:25:11.820
"this device over here beside the fiery furnace

679
00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:15.394
"and I know now that you guys can make this work."

680
00:25:15.394 --> 00:25:18.049
So what happens is, first before they

681
00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:20.728
enter into this fiery furnace Nebuchadnezzar

682
00:25:20.728 --> 00:25:22.336
makes a wager with them that if

683
00:25:22.336 --> 00:25:23.980
they enter into that fiery furnace

684
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.985
and come back out that he'll convert

685
00:25:25.985 --> 00:25:29.217
to their religion, so in the book of Daniel

686
00:25:29.217 --> 00:25:31.478
we're told that these three wise men

687
00:25:31.478 --> 00:25:35.297
put on their coat, their hat, and their other garments

688
00:25:35.297 --> 00:25:37.099
just like the ancient Sumerian gods

689
00:25:37.099 --> 00:25:39.829
are portrayed before they go into a portal.

690
00:25:39.829 --> 00:25:41.675
And you have to ask, why are they

691
00:25:41.675 --> 00:25:44.437
putting on clothing before going into a fiery furnace?

692
00:25:44.437 --> 00:25:45.984
<v Voiceover>Right, buttoning up their coat and boots.</v>

693
00:25:45.984 --> 00:25:48.053
<v ->Right, yeah. Well the coat, hat, and the</v>

694
00:25:48.053 --> 00:25:50.229
other garment turns out is the Shugurra

695
00:25:50.229 --> 00:25:52.436
helmet which Sitchin says means is that which makes

696
00:25:52.436 --> 00:25:54.803
go far into the universe, the Palla,

697
00:25:54.803 --> 00:25:58.058
or miracle garment which is the light body.

698
00:25:58.058 --> 00:25:59.368
So these three guys go into the

699
00:25:59.368 --> 00:26:02.120
fiery furnace, they come back out,

700
00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.826
Nebuchadnezzar and his assembled

701
00:26:03.826 --> 00:26:05.139
are astonished because not only

702
00:26:05.139 --> 00:26:06.931
are they in pristine condition,

703
00:26:06.931 --> 00:26:10.568
they're not alone, the book of Daniel says that,

704
00:26:10.568 --> 00:26:12.456
depending on which version of the story you read,

705
00:26:12.456 --> 00:26:15.122
one like the Son of God or actually

706
00:26:15.122 --> 00:26:19.282
the Son of God appears with them.

707
00:26:21.762 --> 00:26:22.940
They way I read that is they've

708
00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.969
gone into a stargate, a portal, traveled

709
00:26:25.969 --> 00:26:27.772
somewhere and come back with either

710
00:26:27.772 --> 00:26:30.194
the Son of God or one like the Son of God.

711
00:26:30.194 --> 00:26:32.615
And people say, "You mean Jesus?"

712
00:26:32.615 --> 00:26:35.718
No it wasn't Jesus, his name was Nabu,

713
00:26:35.718 --> 00:26:37.062
Nabu was his name, this is where

714
00:26:37.062 --> 00:26:38.929
Nebuchadnezzar takes his name.

715
00:26:38.929 --> 00:26:41.533
Nabu means the royal one, the noble one

716
00:26:41.533 --> 00:26:45.126
he's a son of Marduk one of the great Sumerian gods.

717
00:26:45.126 --> 00:26:47.397
And Nabu brings his wife, they build

718
00:26:47.397 --> 00:26:50.160
ziggurats for him, they build libraries

719
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.469
for him and that is what Saddam was after,

720
00:26:54.469 --> 00:26:56.197
not only the secrets of that stargate

721
00:26:56.197 --> 00:26:58.213
that Nebuchadnezzar opened but also

722
00:26:58.213 --> 00:27:00.261
those libraries because those were

723
00:27:00.261 --> 00:27:02.703
the true weapons of mass destruction.

724
00:27:02.703 --> 00:27:04.996
<v Voiceover>Right yes absolutely.</v>

725
00:27:04.996 --> 00:27:07.087
<v ->And that starts it, and so I started</v>

726
00:27:07.087 --> 00:27:10.627
talking with Art Bell about that around 98

727
00:27:10.627 --> 00:27:12.089
and then my first interview with

728
00:27:12.089 --> 00:27:13.689
George, in fact George Noory's

729
00:27:13.689 --> 00:27:15.844
first interview as host of Coast--

730
00:27:15.844 --> 00:27:17.454
<v Voiceover>Was with you?</v>
<v ->Was with me, yeah</v>

731
00:27:17.454 --> 00:27:18.734
and I started talking about this

732
00:27:18.734 --> 00:27:20.291
and George wasn't following it

733
00:27:20.291 --> 00:27:23.363
so he cuts me off after the first hour

734
00:27:23.363 --> 00:27:24.622
and the next thing we know people

735
00:27:24.622 --> 00:27:25.678
are writing George saying, "Wow

736
00:27:25.678 --> 00:27:27.566
"they, Coast to Coast censored William Henry,

737
00:27:27.566 --> 00:27:29.432
"he's talking about the Iraq stargate story--"

738
00:27:29.432 --> 00:27:30.264
<v Voiceover>Conspiracy theory.</v>

739
00:27:30.264 --> 00:27:31.757
<v ->Conspiracy theory and everything and it's like you know--</v>

740
00:27:31.757 --> 00:27:33.037
<v Voiceover>No really, really we just</v>

741
00:27:33.037 --> 00:27:34.371
didn't know where to take it from there.

742
00:27:34.371 --> 00:27:36.322
<v ->Right exactly, so it was kinda funny</v>

743
00:27:36.322 --> 00:27:38.594
but that starts it and so then I just

744
00:27:38.594 --> 00:27:40.472
kinda find it really interesting

745
00:27:40.472 --> 00:27:42.477
to track that story, everybody talks

746
00:27:42.477 --> 00:27:44.738
about the Iraq stargate, we're sure it's there

747
00:27:44.738 --> 00:27:46.988
but that's really the basis for it,

748
00:27:46.988 --> 00:27:48.962
is that Saddam believed he's Nebuchadnezzar

749
00:27:48.962 --> 00:27:51.010
he's duplicating this and he knows

750
00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.569
where this stuff is, in fact, he collected it.

751
00:27:53.569 --> 00:27:54.348
<v Voiceover>That's a much more</v>

752
00:27:54.348 --> 00:27:56.620
compelling reason to get rid of Saddam Hussein.

753
00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.326
<v ->You got it.
<v Voiceover>Than even</v>

754
00:27:58.326 --> 00:28:00.909
the exploitation of the oil fields.

755
00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:03.957
<v ->Absolutely he, because imagine the technology</v>

756
00:28:03.957 --> 00:28:05.538
we're talking about here, the weapons

757
00:28:05.538 --> 00:28:08.203
potential for some of this is just absolutely astounding.

758
00:28:08.203 --> 00:28:08.907
<v Voiceover>Back to the future.</v>

759
00:28:08.907 --> 00:28:10.251
<v ->Back to the future, that's right,</v>

760
00:28:10.251 --> 00:28:11.670
and what Saddam did he just put

761
00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:13.952
it all together in a nice neat little pile

762
00:28:13.952 --> 00:28:15.008
and all we had to do was make a

763
00:28:15.008 --> 00:28:17.195
bee line for Baghdad and grab it

764
00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:18.077
and that's what we did.

765
00:28:18.077 --> 00:28:19.694
<v Voiceover>So do you feel this was,</v>

766
00:28:19.694 --> 00:28:23.586
at least in part if not more so--

767
00:28:23.586 --> 00:28:25.416
<v ->I think it's the, what is the truth--</v>

768
00:28:25.416 --> 00:28:26.354
<v Voiceover>The foundation of our really</v>

769
00:28:26.354 --> 00:28:28.320
<v ->superimposed over it, yeah absolutely, absolutely.</v>

770
00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.834
They're following this biblical script

771
00:28:29.834 --> 00:28:32.128
this recipe book, this to do list,

772
00:28:32.128 --> 00:28:35.135
and now they've got the goods and

773
00:28:35.135 --> 00:28:36.959
that's just something that happens

774
00:28:36.959 --> 00:28:38.486
over and over again, you can control

775
00:28:38.486 --> 00:28:40.052
a civilization by destroying their

776
00:28:40.052 --> 00:28:41.877
history and inserting a new history.

777
00:28:41.877 --> 00:28:44.585
That's what I feel we'll end up doing in Iraq.

778
00:28:44.585 --> 00:28:46.131
And for the rest of the world too

779
00:28:46.131 --> 00:28:48.159
because the past 30 years beginning

780
00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:51.316
with Sitchin has been this march towards understanding

781
00:28:51.316 --> 00:28:53.908
what happened in ancient Iraq and

782
00:28:53.908 --> 00:28:56.009
now we won't ever know for sure.

783
00:28:58.259 --> 00:28:59.273
<v Voiceover>Well we will but</v>

784
00:28:59.273 --> 00:29:00.840
we're going to have to find it through consciousness.

785
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.404
I mean it's going to be, it'll be

786
00:29:03.404 --> 00:29:06.075
I think more difficult to dig but we

787
00:29:06.075 --> 00:29:07.579
should be able to do it as people

788
00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:09.233
start awakening there are those who

789
00:29:09.233 --> 00:29:10.533
will have full remembrance again.

790
00:29:10.533 --> 00:29:13.030
<v ->I hope so.
<v Voiceover>And meanwhile</v>

791
00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.344
so what's happened with all this,

792
00:29:15.344 --> 00:29:17.701
what's happened with these artifacts to your knowledge?

793
00:29:17.701 --> 00:29:20.890
<v ->I don't know, they've been looted away.</v>

794
00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:22.330
I used to think they maybe they were

795
00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.709
like at Los Alamos or perhaps even Langley

796
00:29:24.709 --> 00:29:27.311
but they might still be in Iraq, they might be--

797
00:29:27.311 --> 00:29:30.906
<v Voiceover>The city of Ur, U R, that is one</v>

798
00:29:30.906 --> 00:29:33.327
of the most ancient cities remaining

799
00:29:33.327 --> 00:29:35.706
on the planet, the US military went in

800
00:29:35.706 --> 00:29:38.809
basically cordoned it off, no one

801
00:29:38.809 --> 00:29:40.377
has admittance to it anymore
<v ->Right.</v>

802
00:29:40.377 --> 00:29:43.329
<v Voiceover>Some of the, well</v>

803
00:29:43.329 --> 00:29:44.834
culturally less refined soldiers

804
00:29:44.834 --> 00:29:46.423
actually started doing a little

805
00:29:46.423 --> 00:29:48.311
you know, bits and pieces of graffiti

806
00:29:48.311 --> 00:29:50.156
all over the place sad to think but

807
00:29:50.156 --> 00:29:52.621
in any event no one has access to it now.

808
00:29:52.621 --> 00:29:57.298
And so it is also said that is the location

809
00:29:57.298 --> 00:29:59.818
of a major stargate.
<v ->Yeah I would</v>

810
00:29:59.818 --> 00:30:01.406
agree with that I would probably

811
00:30:01.406 --> 00:30:04.799
go on to suspect, or hypothesize

812
00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:06.538
that among the booty that Saddam

813
00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:08.916
had collected would be probably some

814
00:30:08.916 --> 00:30:10.846
of the grave sites of some of the ancient Annunaki

815
00:30:10.846 --> 00:30:12.212
and these would contain some of

816
00:30:12.212 --> 00:30:14.590
the 12 and 15 foot giants along with

817
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:16.148
all their gold implements, their

818
00:30:16.148 --> 00:30:18.569
various artifacts that go along with that.

819
00:30:18.569 --> 00:30:20.254
Some of that, you can see some of that,

820
00:30:20.254 --> 00:30:23.603
in the Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia.

821
00:30:23.603 --> 00:30:25.053
Where you see this crown that's

822
00:30:25.053 --> 00:30:27.976
just enormous and I've talked with

823
00:30:27.976 --> 00:30:30.801
other people that hunt these graves out in the southwest,

824
00:30:30.801 --> 00:30:32.656
so I know that they're there and this is real.

825
00:30:32.656 --> 00:30:34.054
<v Voiceover>I know who you're talking about.</v>

826
00:30:34.054 --> 00:30:35.451
<v ->Yeah, and it's very interesting and I'm sure</v>

827
00:30:35.451 --> 00:30:39.781
that's part of what Saddam was assembling as well.

828
00:30:39.781 --> 00:30:43.322
This is, you put this out in a public venue

829
00:30:43.322 --> 00:30:46.512
and suddenly it changes everything.

830
00:30:46.512 --> 00:30:48.016
<v Voiceover>Foundationally, it changes everything.</v>

831
00:30:48.016 --> 00:30:49.477
<v ->Foundationally, absolutely, as I say pulls</v>

832
00:30:49.477 --> 00:30:51.205
the rug out of our Judeo-Christian

833
00:30:51.205 --> 00:30:53.882
culture , it says, forget about it.

834
00:30:53.882 --> 00:30:55.471
<v Voiceover>And yet at the same time,</v>

835
00:30:55.471 --> 00:30:57.007
as you say, there are these major

836
00:30:57.007 --> 00:30:58.532
discoveries in the Southwest of these

837
00:30:58.532 --> 00:31:01.668
redheaded 15 foot tall beings that

838
00:31:01.668 --> 00:31:03.961
are in these cylindrical tombs almost,

839
00:31:03.961 --> 00:31:06.500
and then you have the artifacts from

840
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.974
the early part of the 20th century

841
00:31:08.974 --> 00:31:11.096
in the Grand Canyon, all these Egyptian artifacts

842
00:31:11.096 --> 00:31:13.059
the Smithsonian spirited away,

843
00:31:13.059 --> 00:31:14.265
how in the world did they get there?

844
00:31:14.265 --> 00:31:16.494
It was very precarious for anybody

845
00:31:16.494 --> 00:31:18.755
to get into that cave loaded with

846
00:31:18.755 --> 00:31:20.398
Egyptian artifacts, you've got

847
00:31:20.398 --> 00:31:22.488
ziggurats replicated throughout

848
00:31:22.488 --> 00:31:24.685
South America and African featured

849
00:31:24.685 --> 00:31:27.693
gods and idols in stone there.

850
00:31:27.693 --> 00:31:29.218
<v ->That's right and even the southeast</v>

851
00:31:29.218 --> 00:31:30.456
of the United States, the Ohio

852
00:31:30.456 --> 00:31:32.183
Valley, Thomas Jefferson was very

853
00:31:32.183 --> 00:31:33.741
interested in the mound sites of

854
00:31:33.741 --> 00:31:36.344
the ancient Americans, what's in them

855
00:31:36.344 --> 00:31:38.455
and let's go get it because they

856
00:31:38.455 --> 00:31:40.567
know that this stuff is still around

857
00:31:40.567 --> 00:31:42.092
and ultimately if you can get it,

858
00:31:42.092 --> 00:31:44.289
that's the true power in this world.

859
00:31:44.289 --> 00:31:45.409
<v Voiceover>Well the ones who</v>

860
00:31:45.409 --> 00:31:47.233
are currently controlling things

861
00:31:47.233 --> 00:31:48.737
from an obvious point of view,

862
00:31:48.737 --> 00:31:50.156
looking at the governments of the world

863
00:31:50.156 --> 00:31:52.480
and so forth aren't going to, it seems

864
00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.286
to me, be able to keep an entire,

865
00:31:54.286 --> 00:31:55.732
a lid on it for too long, I mean

866
00:31:55.732 --> 00:31:58.249
we are, we're talking, other people

867
00:31:58.249 --> 00:31:59.423
are talking--
<v ->Right.</v>

868
00:31:59.423 --> 00:32:01.300
<v Voiceover>So there are encouraging signs</v>

869
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.612
that we're going to have to find our way back

870
00:32:02.612 --> 00:32:04.222
but some of it's hiding in plain sight,

871
00:32:04.222 --> 00:32:07.305
from what I've been told, in the hieroglyphics

872
00:32:07.305 --> 00:32:09.961
learn to understand these things

873
00:32:09.961 --> 00:32:11.721
and you'll see what the pathway

874
00:32:11.721 --> 00:32:13.781
to your own self--
<v ->Exactly, absolutely.</v>

875
00:32:13.781 --> 00:32:14.792
<v Voiceover>to truest illuminated</v>

876
00:32:14.792 --> 00:32:17.864
nature is, so it's looking good.

877
00:32:17.864 --> 00:32:19.197
Meanwhile, we just have to bring this

878
00:32:19.197 --> 00:32:20.200
up as a tease because we don't

879
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.395
have a lot of time left and I want

880
00:32:21.395 --> 00:32:23.689
to talk to you again, you're launching

881
00:32:23.689 --> 00:32:25.618
into a new project right now and

882
00:32:25.618 --> 00:32:28.488
you're looking at the iconography

883
00:32:28.488 --> 00:32:32.061
and such of the Capitol.
<v ->That's right, that's right.</v>

884
00:32:32.061 --> 00:32:33.948
<v Voiceover>in DC, and your pictures are</v>

885
00:32:33.948 --> 00:32:35.475
absolutely amazing.
<v ->Thank you.</v>

886
00:32:35.475 --> 00:32:37.180
<v Voiceover>And I've read some of your</v>

887
00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.313
text on it already, we're looking at

888
00:32:39.313 --> 00:32:41.831
flat out mysticism, we're looking at

889
00:32:41.831 --> 00:32:45.041
star connections, the imagery of

890
00:32:45.041 --> 00:32:47.420
George Washington embedded among

891
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.660
angels with stars on their head,

892
00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:51.889
now I assume this isn't all by accident?

893
00:32:51.889 --> 00:32:54.129
<v ->No it's not by accident.
<v Voiceover>It's a temple?</v>

894
00:32:54.129 --> 00:32:56.668
<v ->The United States Capitol is a temple.</v>

895
00:32:56.668 --> 00:32:57.659
I mean Thomas Jefferson called it

896
00:32:57.659 --> 00:32:59.776
a Temple of Sovereignty, it was

897
00:32:59.776 --> 00:33:01.317
referred to as the Temple of Liberty,

898
00:33:01.317 --> 00:33:02.746
it was thought that this would

899
00:33:02.746 --> 00:33:04.837
be the first Temple of Liberty.

900
00:33:04.837 --> 00:33:06.885
In fact, it's virtually a mirror image

901
00:33:06.885 --> 00:33:09.296
not only of the Vatican but the Vatican

902
00:33:09.296 --> 00:33:11.951
itself is a recreation of Solomon's Temple

903
00:33:11.951 --> 00:33:14.351
which if you read Sitchin Solomon's Temple

904
00:33:14.351 --> 00:33:16.687
is simply an Annunaki gateway and

905
00:33:16.687 --> 00:33:18.756
when you said the US Capitol is a

906
00:33:18.756 --> 00:33:21.668
stargate, people are like what are you talking about,

907
00:33:21.668 --> 00:33:23.652
but then you look on the ceiling

908
00:33:23.652 --> 00:33:26.212
of this dome and you see George Washington

909
00:33:26.212 --> 00:33:28.676
sitting on a rainbow with 72 stars

910
00:33:28.676 --> 00:33:30.382
around him, the processional number,

911
00:33:30.382 --> 00:33:32.292
you say well okay that's a representation

912
00:33:32.292 --> 00:33:33.262
of the founder of this country

913
00:33:33.262 --> 00:33:36.419
sitting in a stargate as a transfigured being.

914
00:33:36.419 --> 00:33:38.787
And because that's what the Founding Fathers

915
00:33:38.787 --> 00:33:41.336
thought of this place as, as a place

916
00:33:41.336 --> 00:33:43.651
where enlightenment principles

917
00:33:43.651 --> 00:33:45.838
would rule which meant that individuals

918
00:33:45.838 --> 00:33:47.832
would be free to pursue not just

919
00:33:47.832 --> 00:33:50.882
liberty but true cosmic sovereignty.

920
00:33:50.882 --> 00:33:51.960
<v Voiceover>And again the Sumerian,</v>

921
00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.923
we keep going back to Sumerian

922
00:33:53.923 --> 00:33:55.841
because those are the most ancient

923
00:33:55.841 --> 00:33:57.826
known texts, we can't go back to Atlantis

924
00:33:57.826 --> 00:34:00.876
or Lemuria so all there is is Sumeria

925
00:34:00.876 --> 00:34:02.359
and we have to assume that whatever

926
00:34:02.359 --> 00:34:07.359
was before that Sumeria was a hand me down from that.

927
00:34:07.437 --> 00:34:10.367
With all this hand me down information

928
00:34:10.367 --> 00:34:15.367
it branches off and totally permeates

929
00:34:15.978 --> 00:34:18.633
the consciousness of the Founding Fathers of this country.

930
00:34:18.633 --> 00:34:19.892
<v ->Without a doubt and then suddenly</v>

931
00:34:19.892 --> 00:34:21.172
it gets hijacked, I mean after

932
00:34:21.172 --> 00:34:22.697
the building of the Capitol and the

933
00:34:22.697 --> 00:34:23.956
founding of the country and now

934
00:34:23.956 --> 00:34:25.182
this is where you get into the

935
00:34:25.182 --> 00:34:27.337
whole nefarious Illuminati story

936
00:34:27.337 --> 00:34:28.360
and everything but the original

937
00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.619
intention was to set this place up

938
00:34:29.619 --> 00:34:32.968
as a place where people could become enlightened.

939
00:34:32.968 --> 00:34:35.038
And in fact the Capitol is a very

940
00:34:35.038 --> 00:34:36.680
symbol of enlightenment it has

941
00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:38.856
seven key chambers that correspond with

942
00:34:38.856 --> 00:34:41.171
the seven chakras of the human body

943
00:34:41.171 --> 00:34:43.048
and you've got this dome in the center

944
00:34:43.048 --> 00:34:45.341
that has all this cosmic imagery in it,

945
00:34:45.341 --> 00:34:47.111
it's because--
<v Voiceover>You said it has</v>

946
00:34:47.111 --> 00:34:48.914
similarities in layout to Luxor?

947
00:34:48.914 --> 00:34:50.887
<v ->The US Capitol, yes that's right</v>

948
00:34:50.887 --> 00:34:52.231
the Luxor temple is called the

949
00:34:52.231 --> 00:34:54.385
Temple of Man or Temple in Man

950
00:34:54.385 --> 00:34:56.924
and when you superimpose the Luxor

951
00:34:56.924 --> 00:34:58.791
temple diagram over the Capitol

952
00:34:58.791 --> 00:35:02.247
it's a perfect match, you know.

953
00:35:02.247 --> 00:35:04.400
<v Voiceover>Well, to be continued</v>

954
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.737
because that's another big
<v ->Yeah it is.</v>

955
00:35:06.737 --> 00:35:07.772
