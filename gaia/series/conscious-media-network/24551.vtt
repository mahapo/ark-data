00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.490
<v ->We had the pleasure of going to the Green Festival</v>

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.130
in San Franciso recently and we're able to connect

3
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.071
with some of our favorite people in the world

4
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:11.031
of healthy cuisine, Terces and Matthew Englehart

5
00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:13.231
the owners of Cafe Gratitude.

6
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:15.330
The business was first based on a board game

7
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.490
called the Abundant River game.

8
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.690
Once there was a game the couple needed a place

9
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.150
for people to play the game and thus came

10
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.810
Cafe Gratitude.

11
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.850
Not only do the cafes have exquisite raw cuisine

12
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.630
the entire venture is based on consciousness and community.

13
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.660 line:15% 
(mellow music)

14
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.631
Give a little idea of your background that really required

15
00:00:41.631 --> 00:00:44.630
you to dig deep to find your own inspiration

16
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.450
and bring yourself up.

17
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.480
<v ->Hmm, okay great, that's a good question.</v>

18
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.750
Let's see, I actually came through the path of recovery.

19
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.430
So, I was a competitive athlete when I was growing up

20
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.570
and all the way through to about 17, 18 years old.

21
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.670
Kind of almost the near Olympic level

22
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.430
of a sychronized swimmer.

23
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.912
So, for me, you know, I learned

24
00:01:07.912 --> 00:01:10.992
to like push hard, push beyond the pain.

25
00:01:10.992 --> 00:01:15.012
That was kind of like the nature of, you know,

26
00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:16.491
growing up for me.

27
00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:20.792
And so, you know, I'd say I have a high tolerance for pain.

28
00:01:20.792 --> 00:01:23.351
And, that's not necessarily the healthiest way

29
00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:24.731
to live your life.

30
00:01:24.731 --> 00:01:27.032
So, I came through a sexual abuse background

31
00:01:27.032 --> 00:01:28.612
and an eating disorder.

32
00:01:28.612 --> 00:01:32.052
So, I dealt with anorexia and bulimia for almost 20 years.

33
00:01:32.052 --> 00:01:34.424
For me,
<v Regina>Wow.</v>

34
00:01:35.914 --> 00:01:40.414
<v ->I had three children and I was in my late 30s</v>

35
00:01:40.414 --> 00:01:44.573
when I really started to, you know, come to life

36
00:01:44.573 --> 00:01:49.477
like realize like wow, you know, if I'm gonna live

37
00:01:49.477 --> 00:01:52.258
I've gotta start being responsible for,

38
00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:53.478
you know, my own life.

39
00:01:54.478 --> 00:01:56.507
It was a spiritual path for me, so it was really listening

40
00:01:56.507 --> 00:01:59.247
to my inner guidance and I went on, this is actually

41
00:01:59.247 --> 00:02:01.246
my 21st year of recovery.

42
00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:05.227
This is the first year of actually more years in recovery

43
00:02:05.227 --> 00:02:07.287
than dealing with the addiction.

44
00:02:07.287 --> 00:02:08.806
So, you know--

45
00:02:08.806 --> 00:02:10.746
<v Regina>And, that's a tough one, you're talking</v>

46
00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:12.306
body image.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:12.306 --> 00:02:16.026
<v Regina>In fact, I would love for you as a woman</v>

48
00:02:16.026 --> 00:02:19.507
who's been through this journey, we can do it in a bit,

49
00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:21.751
but I want you to talk about that if you would please,

50
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:24.291
about what's happened to women in our society.

51
00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:26.511
<v ->Well, it's interesting because, you know, there's a lot</v>

52
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:30.932
of addiction in our culture, but you don't have to drink

53
00:02:30.932 --> 00:02:34.411
to live, and you don't have to smoke to live,

54
00:02:34.411 --> 00:02:35.892
but you have to eat to live.

55
00:02:35.892 --> 00:02:38.972
So, you not only have to heal from the abusive patterns

56
00:02:38.972 --> 00:02:41.772
but you have to develop new healthy patterns.

57
00:02:41.772 --> 00:02:43.592
You can't just obstain.

58
00:02:44.432 --> 00:02:48.212
And so, for me it was, you know, a long journey.

59
00:02:49.672 --> 00:02:54.672
When Cafe Gratitude came into the idea I saw like this was

60
00:02:54.852 --> 00:02:57.091
the completion of that whole cycle for me

61
00:02:57.091 --> 00:02:59.112
'cause I'd worked with teens at risk for years

62
00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:02.071
as part of my recovery, but this was like now putting out

63
00:03:02.071 --> 00:03:05.272
a sign and saying, you know, here's a great way

64
00:03:05.272 --> 00:03:08.192
that you can nourish yourself, and it not only sustains you

65
00:03:08.192 --> 00:03:10.792
but it has you be a part of the solution for the planet.

66
00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:13.091
And that, for me, was healing because, you know,

67
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:16.831
addiction can be so self-absorbing and so can recovery,

68
00:03:16.831 --> 00:03:19.352
but then that next level of recovery is when you're like

69
00:03:19.352 --> 00:03:21.052
part of the solution for other people.

70
00:03:21.052 --> 00:03:23.531
So, that's the pathway that I got to where I am

71
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:25.512
and I think that's what makes me inspiring

72
00:03:25.512 --> 00:03:28.851
is it's not like I had an easy life.

73
00:03:28.851 --> 00:03:31.932
I was a single parent with three children for 15 years.

74
00:03:31.932 --> 00:03:36.091
It's more like I've learned to believe in myself.

75
00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:39.871
I've learned to believe in, you know, a higher intelligence.

76
00:03:39.871 --> 00:03:43.271
I've learned to, you know, give and recieve love

77
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:44.972
and my children have gone through this with me.

78
00:03:47.172 --> 00:03:49.311
<v Regina>Yes they have, beautiful by the way.</v>

79
00:03:49.311 --> 00:03:52.051
I've had some contact with one of your sons

80
00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:53.032
on a few occasions.

81
00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:54.251
What a beautiful being.

82
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:55.152
<v ->Thank you.</v>

83
00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:58.683
<v Regina>Yeah, well let's go back into the whole thing</v>

84
00:03:58.683 --> 00:04:01.884
about women and their own self image in this destructive

85
00:04:01.884 --> 00:04:05.463
path we've set ourselves on, careening from one kind

86
00:04:05.463 --> 00:04:08.344
of diet and dysfunction and disorder to another.

87
00:04:08.344 --> 00:04:11.683
Trying to achieve some kind of calculated perfection

88
00:04:11.683 --> 00:04:13.423
that doesn't even exist.

89
00:04:13.423 --> 00:04:15.624
What is your piece in all of that?

90
00:04:15.624 --> 00:04:17.564
<v ->Well, I was right in the middle of all of it.</v>

91
00:04:17.564 --> 00:04:20.434
So, you know, it's interesting because this is the year

92
00:04:21.485 --> 00:04:24.345
for me that something switched, you know, that was at

93
00:04:24.345 --> 00:04:26.326
a deeper level of recovery.

94
00:04:26.326 --> 00:04:29.545
And that was, because of what we do and because of what

95
00:04:29.545 --> 00:04:31.585
I've always done I think I've been surrounded by people

96
00:04:31.585 --> 00:04:32.966
who were younger than me.

97
00:04:32.966 --> 00:04:34.405
I've worked in restaurants a lot.

98
00:04:34.405 --> 00:04:36.986
I had an inspirational notepad company.

99
00:04:36.986 --> 00:04:39.526
I worked with teens at risk, and now we're in the restaurant

100
00:04:39.526 --> 00:04:42.426
business again, and most of our employees are a lot younger.

101
00:04:42.426 --> 00:04:44.625
And so, I think there's always this comparing yourself

102
00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:47.825
not only to the ideal that's set forth in the media,

103
00:04:47.825 --> 00:04:51.645
but also then to who you see, you know, as like

104
00:04:51.645 --> 00:04:53.305
what's mirrored back for you.

105
00:04:53.305 --> 00:04:55.225
And, for the first time this year I'd say

106
00:04:55.225 --> 00:04:57.025
I'm freed up of that.

107
00:04:57.025 --> 00:05:00.885
And, I think it comes from my life is about something

108
00:05:00.885 --> 00:05:03.306
so much bigger than myself.

109
00:05:03.306 --> 00:05:08.246
And, I'm happy with myself, I love myself

110
00:05:08.246 --> 00:05:11.766
and at a level I don't think I'd experienced,

111
00:05:11.766 --> 00:05:14.747
you know, even with 20 years of recovery from dealing with,

112
00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:18.246
you know, the actual addiction of either abstaining

113
00:05:18.246 --> 00:05:20.767
from food, or having food, eating food.

114
00:05:20.767 --> 00:05:23.787
So, the exciting thing about that for me is that I know

115
00:05:23.787 --> 00:05:26.268
it's now possible, because, you know, before it was like

116
00:05:26.268 --> 00:05:28.147
you could talk to people and say, "Yeah, it's possible."

117
00:05:28.147 --> 00:05:29.807
but if you haven't experienced it yourself...

118
00:05:29.807 --> 00:05:31.748
And, so many women deal with this.

119
00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:35.467
We have so many beautiful young women who work for us

120
00:05:35.467 --> 00:05:38.847
that have like what you or I or most of would consider

121
00:05:38.847 --> 00:05:42.467
like the perfect body and they're still

122
00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:45.487
beating themselves up and comparing themselves

123
00:05:45.487 --> 00:05:47.287
and judging themselves.

124
00:05:47.287 --> 00:05:49.747
And, you know, I've kind of drawn a line in our family

125
00:05:49.747 --> 00:05:51.508
and said, "Okay, this isn't going to go on another

126
00:05:51.508 --> 00:05:54.207
"generation," like, "this it, this is the end of this."

127
00:05:54.207 --> 00:05:56.427
And, I talk to the young people in our communities

128
00:05:56.427 --> 00:05:58.007
and I say, "This isn't going to go on.

129
00:05:58.007 --> 00:05:59.788
"We're going to say it ends here."

130
00:05:59.788 --> 00:06:01.967
And, part of that, I think, is we do a workshop,

131
00:06:01.967 --> 00:06:03.988
Matthew and I do a workshop called Kindred Spirit

132
00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:05.428
and the other day when I was leading it

133
00:06:05.428 --> 00:06:06.807
I saw something.

134
00:06:06.807 --> 00:06:10.637
One of the things that we say is that you have to

135
00:06:11.567 --> 00:06:13.967
love yourself first.

136
00:06:13.967 --> 00:06:17.068
And, we've heard that, that's just age old wisdom.

137
00:06:17.068 --> 00:06:20.147
But, it's hard to know what that means,

138
00:06:20.147 --> 00:06:21.687
or what does that really look like.

139
00:06:21.687 --> 00:06:22.928
<v Regina>How do you embody that?</v>

140
00:06:22.928 --> 00:06:23.867
<v ->How do you do tht, right?</v>

141
00:06:23.867 --> 00:06:25.708
But I saw, like when you love yourself

142
00:06:25.708 --> 00:06:28.047
just the way you are, even if it's just for a moment,

143
00:06:28.047 --> 00:06:30.427
even if it's just practicing saying, "I love myself,"

144
00:06:30.427 --> 00:06:32.427
it gets you t be present.

145
00:06:32.427 --> 00:06:35.727
And, when you're present then you can give

146
00:06:35.727 --> 00:06:36.927
and receive love.

147
00:06:36.927 --> 00:06:39.219
If you're not present you can't give and recieve love.

148
00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:42.359
So, if you're not loving yourself, even just for a moment,

149
00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:45.619
like the blink of an eye, like a meditation, then

150
00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:47.339
you can't ever give and receive love.

151
00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:49.339
And, if you can't give and recieve love then there's always

152
00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:51.299
some experience of a void.

153
00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:54.739
Se, I think the key is, what I would say to people now,

154
00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:56.819
the key is being present.

155
00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:59.339
And, you know, I recoevered through these

156
00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:01.759
four spiritual principles that were given to me

157
00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:05.359
and one of those principles was like,

158
00:07:05.359 --> 00:07:07.119
"Being here right now."

159
00:07:07.119 --> 00:07:09.900
It was like, "Staying in the moment."

160
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.480
And, even though I worked that for 21 years now

161
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.979
it took on a whole new meaning the other day

162
00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:15.819
when we were just leading this workshop and I saw,

163
00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:19.859
"Oh, if you can't give and recieve love then you're

164
00:07:19.859 --> 00:07:20.960
"never fulfilled."

165
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.220
<v Regina>Yeah, that judgement whether it's self judgement</v>

166
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.500
or judgement of others is the absolute love stopper.

167
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.900
It kind of kills the deal.

168
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.500
<v ->And, I think those are the same self-judgement</v>

169
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.640
and judging others go hand in hand, it's the same thing.

170
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.580
It's just reflected out or it's reflected in,

171
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.920
but it's the same thing.

172
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.515
<v Regina>Well, now we're looking at gratitude</v>

173
00:07:37.515 --> 00:07:41.015
and on the internet a year or two ago Go Gratitude

174
00:07:41.015 --> 00:07:43.135
was going around and people started really looking

175
00:07:43.135 --> 00:07:44.935
at the word gratitude in a new way.

176
00:07:44.935 --> 00:07:47.334
And, prior to that, you'd already opened the cafe,

177
00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:49.814
Cafe Gratitude, but you also have your book,

178
00:07:49.814 --> 00:07:51.814
you have a board game that preceded that.

179
00:07:51.814 --> 00:07:53.575
Can you talk about the journey that happened

180
00:07:53.575 --> 00:07:58.004
prior to you launching back into the restaurant industry?

181
00:07:58.774 --> 00:08:00.154
<v ->Well, when Matthew and I got together</v>

182
00:08:00.154 --> 00:08:03.134
about seven years ago we said, "We're just gonna live

183
00:08:03.134 --> 00:08:05.154
"our life trusting inner guidance."

184
00:08:05.154 --> 00:08:07.575
Now, I lived my life trusting inner guidance in my own

185
00:08:07.575 --> 00:08:10.794
path of recovery, but that was like me, my guidance.

186
00:08:10.794 --> 00:08:13.256
So, it's different to be in a relationship and live

187
00:08:13.256 --> 00:08:15.555
your life trusting inner guidance, 'cause what if he gets

188
00:08:15.555 --> 00:08:17.815
some guidance and now I'm gonna trust that?

189
00:08:17.815 --> 00:08:20.676
Or I get the guidance and he gonna trust me?

190
00:08:20.676 --> 00:08:23.556
But, it's been a profound journey and it's been really

191
00:08:23.556 --> 00:08:25.135
the foundation of our relationship.

192
00:08:25.135 --> 00:08:26.896
So, you know, the first thing we heard was

193
00:08:26.896 --> 00:08:27.896
invent a board game.

194
00:08:27.896 --> 00:08:30.455
And, you know, neither one of us knew how to invent

195
00:08:30.455 --> 00:08:33.511
a board game; we'd never done anything like that before.

196
00:08:33.511 --> 00:08:35.692
But, we just took what we knew.

197
00:08:35.692 --> 00:08:38.712
We got a blank piece of canvas, we got some index cards,

198
00:08:38.712 --> 00:08:42.412
some pebbles, some dice and we just started taking turns.

199
00:08:42.412 --> 00:08:44.681
And it was like, "It's your turn, what are you gonna do?"

200
00:08:44.681 --> 00:08:46.521
And then, we'd take notes and talk about it.

201
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:48.401
And then, he'd say, "It's your turn, what are you gonna do?"

202
00:08:48.401 --> 00:08:49.861
And, we'd take notes and talk about it.

203
00:08:49.861 --> 00:08:51.381
And, a year later we had this game called

204
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:53.521
the Abounding River board game.

205
00:08:53.521 --> 00:08:55.881
And, the Abounding River is about, it's a spiritual

206
00:08:55.881 --> 00:08:59.342
journey practicing keeping your attention on qualities

207
00:08:59.342 --> 00:09:01.921
of what we call the divine, qualities of oneness,

208
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:05.243
quality of god, god is love, nature, whatever your

209
00:09:05.243 --> 00:09:07.163
expression of the divine is.

210
00:09:07.163 --> 00:09:09.542
When you keep your attention on qualities of divine

211
00:09:09.542 --> 00:09:11.213
then that's what you experience.

212
00:09:11.213 --> 00:09:12.963
<v Regina>Absolutely, and it's so much more healthy</v>

213
00:09:12.963 --> 00:09:14.523
than trying to corner Park Place.

214
00:09:14.523 --> 00:09:16.462
<v ->Exactly.
(laughs)

215
00:09:16.462 --> 00:09:19.062
A lot healthier, a new paradigm actually.

216
00:09:19.062 --> 00:09:20.562
<v Regina>It is, it's a beautiful game.</v>

217
00:09:20.562 --> 00:09:23.742
And when you come into Cafe Gratitude, the first time

218
00:09:23.742 --> 00:09:26.662
we went there your son gave us a copy of that

219
00:09:26.662 --> 00:09:30.382
to take to the table and start playing to start exploring

220
00:09:30.382 --> 00:09:33.102
the feelings before you even got your menu.

221
00:09:33.102 --> 00:09:34.282
<v ->Right, good.</v>

222
00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:36.482
<v Regina>It was really quite interesting.</v>

223
00:09:36.482 --> 00:09:37.962
So, where did that go then?

224
00:09:37.962 --> 00:09:39.962
<v ->Well, so we had this board game and along the way</v>

225
00:09:39.962 --> 00:09:41.802
we'd gotten some counseling to write a book

226
00:09:41.802 --> 00:09:43.882
so we created the same practice in a book,

227
00:09:43.882 --> 00:09:46.562
a 42 day practice format.

228
00:09:46.562 --> 00:09:48.542
And so, Matthew and I said, "Well, we gotta have a place

229
00:09:48.542 --> 00:09:49.982
"where people can come play this."

230
00:09:49.982 --> 00:09:51.642
And so, we thought, "Well, we'll open up a cafe."

231
00:09:51.642 --> 00:09:54.162
And, I had a bakery background so we thought we'd do scones

232
00:09:54.162 --> 00:09:57.107
and great muffins and coffee and teas.

233
00:09:57.107 --> 00:10:00.907
And then, we were in Hawaii and I read a book about

234
00:10:00.907 --> 00:10:03.307
a living foods diet and just resonated.

235
00:10:03.307 --> 00:10:05.607
I could feel like, "Oh, there's something deep here."

236
00:10:05.607 --> 00:10:07.907
So, Matthew and I took it on for 30 days

237
00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:09.127
like an experiment.

238
00:10:09.127 --> 00:10:10.787
And, we just couldn't believe how great we felt.

239
00:10:10.787 --> 00:10:12.107
We were already doing yoga.

240
00:10:12.107 --> 00:10:15.047
We were already vegetarian, mostly vegan

241
00:10:15.047 --> 00:10:17.667
and yet it was a completely different experience.

242
00:10:17.667 --> 00:10:19.987
So, we thought, "We'll just make it a raw foods cafe."

243
00:10:19.987 --> 00:10:22.207
And, I've always had kind of an alchemy with food.

244
00:10:22.207 --> 00:10:25.607
My mother taught me that, and so, you know,

245
00:10:25.607 --> 00:10:28.007
I started playing around with developing recipes.

246
00:10:28.007 --> 00:10:30.867
And, we had people into our house and we asked them,

247
00:10:30.867 --> 00:10:33.727
"Well, would you drive across town for this?

248
00:10:33.727 --> 00:10:35.407
"Would you order it a second time?"

249
00:10:35.407 --> 00:10:37.527
And, that's how we started developing the menu

250
00:10:37.527 --> 00:10:38.627
for Cafe Gratitude.

251
00:10:38.627 --> 00:10:42.427
And so now, Cafe Gratitude really is a gaming parlor.

252
00:10:42.427 --> 00:10:43.447
And, it's a --

253
00:10:43.447 --> 00:10:45.947
<v Regina>Conscious gaming parlor.</v>

254
00:10:45.947 --> 00:10:47.747
<v ->Conscious gaming parlor, a place of transformation.</v>

255
00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:50.967
And, we serve really, really great tasting delicious

256
00:10:50.967 --> 00:10:51.947
raw food.

257
00:10:51.947 --> 00:10:55.207
<v Regina>Oh well, I not only have driven across town,</v>

258
00:10:55.207 --> 00:10:57.877
I think we've driven about 100 miles to go to the cafe

259
00:10:57.877 --> 00:10:58.747
upon occasion.

260
00:10:58.747 --> 00:11:00.007
<v ->We're coming in your direction, though.</v>

261
00:11:00.007 --> 00:11:01.108
Sacramento's on the map.

262
00:11:01.108 --> 00:11:02.297
<v Regina>I can't wait.</v>

263
00:11:02.297 --> 00:11:04.927
And, I remember the first time going there

264
00:11:04.927 --> 00:11:07.557
and I bring this up for a reason, first of all you put

265
00:11:07.557 --> 00:11:09.337
the board game in front of us, we were just tinkering

266
00:11:09.337 --> 00:11:10.367
and playing.

267
00:11:10.367 --> 00:11:12.827
And then, you interact with this "I am grateful for,"

268
00:11:12.827 --> 00:11:13.968
and I am.

269
00:11:13.968 --> 00:11:16.128
And, it's funny because at first there's the giggle factor.

270
00:11:16.128 --> 00:11:17.867
Oh, you know, I am...
(laughs)

271
00:11:19.169 --> 00:11:21.349
You have to choose your little word, what you feel

272
00:11:21.349 --> 00:11:23.249
you're resonating with at the moment and you call

273
00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:24.269
each other that.

274
00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:26.309
Well, and it does have a giggle factor, you're embarassed

275
00:11:26.309 --> 00:11:28.529
at first because if you're going to be honest and pick

276
00:11:28.529 --> 00:11:31.509
some beautiful word representing you we don't have that

277
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:33.769
in our culture, it's not part of our paradigm

278
00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:35.609
to speak highly of ourselves.

279
00:11:35.609 --> 00:11:38.829
And so, you really through developing this put people

280
00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:41.009
as they walk into the door in the space of having

281
00:11:41.009 --> 00:11:43.870
to honor not just themselves but each other.

282
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.810
Tell us a little bit about that part and what you see in it.

283
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.610
<v ->Well, that's been an interesting journey</v>

284
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.990
because, you know, it's opened us up to a lot of criticism.

285
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.710
But, we consider that healthy because we know

286
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.230
it's not personal they're not criticising us.

287
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.550
They're criticising that they don't have the freedom

288
00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.290
to actually be able to express those divine qualities

289
00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.390
in themselves.

290
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:06.331
And, if you think about that it's kinda sad that ego

291
00:12:06.331 --> 00:12:10.451
will always argue with whatever you're saying,

292
00:12:10.451 --> 00:12:13.391
but it won't argue with the dimishing.

293
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:17.511
Like, if you say, "I'm lazy" or "I'm fat," ego never goes,

294
00:12:17.511 --> 00:12:19.931
"No, you're not. You look beautiful today."

295
00:12:19.931 --> 00:12:22.771
But, as soon as you say, "I am beautiful," you know,

296
00:12:22.771 --> 00:12:25.871
then it goes, "Whoa wait, hold on, take a look again."

297
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:27.851
You know, so it's like we say you're always affirming

298
00:12:27.851 --> 00:12:30.992
something it's just you're not normally affirming

299
00:12:30.992 --> 00:12:33.592
the qualities that actually have you be your brightest,

300
00:12:33.592 --> 00:12:35.952
most beautiful divine self.

301
00:12:35.952 --> 00:12:37.612
And that's what we're putting in place.

302
00:12:37.612 --> 00:12:39.252
<v Regina>That is the saddest part of</v>

303
00:12:39.252 --> 00:12:40.772
human nature.
<v ->It is so sad.</v>

304
00:12:40.772 --> 00:12:42.652
<v Regina>I'm actually, my eyes are getting teared up</v>

305
00:12:42.652 --> 00:12:44.612
just when you're saying these things.

306
00:12:44.612 --> 00:12:48.572
It is so deeply true of everyone, beautiful, beautiful

307
00:12:48.572 --> 00:12:52.272
human beings that for some reason they're made to feel

308
00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:53.932
in their own minds inadequate.

309
00:12:53.932 --> 00:12:56.512
I mean, we know we can rail on about the institutions

310
00:12:56.512 --> 00:12:59.272
that have created this, but the point is we have to move

311
00:12:59.272 --> 00:13:00.392
beyond them.

312
00:13:00.392 --> 00:13:03.712
And, to come to a place like yours and to be forced,

313
00:13:03.712 --> 00:13:08.324
kind of, into saying, "Oh, I am delicious today,"

314
00:13:08.324 --> 00:13:10.664
and you know, laugh with your friends and call each other

315
00:13:10.664 --> 00:13:13.004
delicious and beautiful and intelligent

316
00:13:13.004 --> 00:13:14.644
or what not, brilliant.

317
00:13:14.644 --> 00:13:18.744
It really does start breaking down some kind of interesting

318
00:13:18.744 --> 00:13:20.764
invisible wall.

319
00:13:20.764 --> 00:13:22.364
<v ->And, that's what I think the laughter is.</v>

320
00:13:22.364 --> 00:13:24.784
I think the laughter is just a release of energy

321
00:13:24.784 --> 00:13:27.984
that actually kind of blocking you from experiencing that.

322
00:13:27.984 --> 00:13:29.864
You know Sayla's our first born granddaughter.

323
00:13:29.864 --> 00:13:31.264
She's four years old now.

324
00:13:31.264 --> 00:13:33.804
And, since the day she was born I practice saying to her,

325
00:13:33.804 --> 00:13:35.484
"You are beautiful. You are beautiful."

326
00:13:35.484 --> 00:13:37.304
And, I've had her like get in front of the mirror

327
00:13:37.304 --> 00:13:39.864
and practice saying, "I am beautiful," before it meant

328
00:13:39.864 --> 00:13:41.224
anything to her.

329
00:13:41.224 --> 00:13:44.284
And now, she's four and this year between three and four

330
00:13:44.284 --> 00:13:46.584
I can tell that it's like she can own it.

331
00:13:46.584 --> 00:13:48.034
Like, she looks in the mirror and she says,

332
00:13:48.034 --> 00:13:50.024
"I am beautiful."

333
00:13:50.024 --> 00:13:52.724
And yet, you know, this is like a child that doesn't have

334
00:13:52.724 --> 00:13:56.944
a history of judging herself, and now it's like can we keep

335
00:13:56.944 --> 00:13:59.564
that in place, can we keep that in place as we move

336
00:13:59.564 --> 00:14:00.764
forward in our life?

337
00:14:00.764 --> 00:14:02.944
But, this is what all of us are dealing with.

338
00:14:02.944 --> 00:14:04.624
<v Regina>Yes, we're all dealing with it.</v>

339
00:14:04.624 --> 00:14:07.024
It really seems to transcend boundaries.

340
00:14:07.024 --> 00:14:10.064
You may be living in Asia, you're dealing with it

341
00:14:10.064 --> 00:14:11.144
in another way.

342
00:14:11.144 --> 00:14:13.364
It doesn't really matter where you're living on the planet.

343
00:14:13.364 --> 00:14:17.504
This thing that has taken root that somehow we're less

344
00:14:17.504 --> 00:14:21.084
instead of more has to be reversed.

345
00:14:21.084 --> 00:14:24.004
I mean, you're doing your part very beautifully.

346
00:14:24.004 --> 00:14:26.164
Now, what about the whole notion of gratitude?

347
00:14:26.164 --> 00:14:28.824
As a principle, as a spiritual principle was that part

348
00:14:28.824 --> 00:14:31.024
of those four elements that you started working with

349
00:14:31.024 --> 00:14:31.904
years ago?

350
00:14:31.904 --> 00:14:34.494
<v ->Yeah, and also gratitude the thing that's so magical</v>

351
00:14:34.494 --> 00:14:37.624
about gratitude is we say gratitude puts your being,

352
00:14:37.624 --> 00:14:41.324
your experience, the beingness of human into the shape

353
00:14:41.324 --> 00:14:44.204
of having, which partly get your present.

354
00:14:44.204 --> 00:14:47.624
See, if I ask you right now what are you grateful for?

355
00:14:47.624 --> 00:14:49.544
Let's ask you, what are you grateful for?

356
00:14:49.544 --> 00:14:50.904
What's one thing that you're grateful for that you

357
00:14:50.904 --> 00:14:52.164
haven't expressed yet today?

358
00:14:52.164 --> 00:14:53.874
<v Regina>Oh, I'm very grateful to be sitting here</v>

359
00:14:53.874 --> 00:14:55.824
with you because it makes my heart feel good.

360
00:14:55.824 --> 00:14:57.664
<v ->And then, what's your experience right now</v>

361
00:14:57.664 --> 00:14:59.864
when you shift your attention to that,

362
00:14:59.864 --> 00:15:00.904
what do you experience?

363
00:15:00.904 --> 00:15:02.264
What's it feel like?

364
00:15:02.264 --> 00:15:04.764
<v Regina>Very uplifting and full.</v>

365
00:15:04.764 --> 00:15:07.484
Yeah, very uplifting and full.

366
00:15:07.484 --> 00:15:08.684
<v ->And, it has you be here.</v>

367
00:15:08.684 --> 00:15:10.184
<v Regina>Yes, oh yes.</v>
<v ->See, that' the thing</v>

368
00:15:10.184 --> 00:15:12.424
that's so beautiful is like when we put our attention

369
00:15:12.424 --> 00:15:15.704
on gratitude we start realizing all we already have.

370
00:15:15.704 --> 00:15:19.924
So, we stop that kind of insatiable quest for more,

371
00:15:19.924 --> 00:15:23.904
or different, or better because we see what we already have.

372
00:15:23.904 --> 00:15:28.064
And, that's really the notion of gratitude is it has this

373
00:15:28.064 --> 00:15:31.984
be here now, be present, see how fortunate we already are.

374
00:15:31.984 --> 00:15:34.744
<v Regina>Those little moments are zinging by us</v>

375
00:15:34.744 --> 00:15:37.624
and we're not noticing the beauty in our own lives.

376
00:15:37.624 --> 00:15:40.044
<v ->We say that there's a whole universe working on our</v>

377
00:15:40.044 --> 00:15:43.864
behalf 24/7 and we rarely acknowledge it.

378
00:15:43.864 --> 00:15:45.544
<v Regina>We're kinda walking right past it</v>

379
00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:47.104
with blinders on.

380
00:15:47.104 --> 00:15:50.844
<v ->And, I think that when people can keep their attention</v>

381
00:15:50.844 --> 00:15:54.784
more on gratitude, like lengthen the time they can express,

382
00:15:54.784 --> 00:15:58.224
experience, put their attention on gratitude and shorten

383
00:15:58.224 --> 00:16:00.504
the distance between those thoughts that's when you

384
00:16:00.504 --> 00:16:02.644
get to experience like your real beauty,

385
00:16:02.644 --> 00:16:05.764
your real fulfillment because you're present, you're here.

386
00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:07.384
Mostly, we're not here.

387
00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:08.524
<v Regina>Mostly, we're not here.</v>

388
00:16:08.524 --> 00:16:10.335
We're living in the past, we're living in the future.

389
00:16:10.335 --> 00:16:13.385
We're living maybe in fear.
<v ->Or regret.</v>

390
00:16:13.385 --> 00:16:14.785
<v Regina>You know, questions.</v>

391
00:16:14.785 --> 00:16:18.105
And, now what's happened is as a result of following

392
00:16:18.105 --> 00:16:20.125
these intuitions you've created the game,

393
00:16:20.125 --> 00:16:24.045
you created the book, you went far past creating a bakery.

394
00:16:24.045 --> 00:16:27.325
You have probably, I guess, just from my own experience

395
00:16:27.325 --> 00:16:29.535
certainly one of the best raw food

396
00:16:30.606 --> 00:16:33.285
establishments anywhere.

397
00:16:33.285 --> 00:16:36.046
I mean, I'm not totally versed, I haven't been all over

398
00:16:36.046 --> 00:16:38.185
the world to every raw food establishment,

399
00:16:38.185 --> 00:16:39.806
certainly the best I've found thus far.

400
00:16:39.806 --> 00:16:42.945
But, it's turning into an actual working financial model

401
00:16:42.945 --> 00:16:45.605
as well and this is the piece that a lot

402
00:16:45.605 --> 00:16:48.105
of people don't get yet.

403
00:16:48.105 --> 00:16:50.945
It's how do we go from doing something simply to pay

404
00:16:50.945 --> 00:16:55.105
the bills and make those massive compromises in life

405
00:16:55.105 --> 00:16:58.385
to unplugging and going where you did, which is two people

406
00:16:58.385 --> 00:17:01.386
sitting down and saying, "Let's follow our intuition,

407
00:17:01.386 --> 00:17:02.446
"do a board game."

408
00:17:03.216 --> 00:17:06.056
Yikes, you know, and then going to where you are now.

409
00:17:06.056 --> 00:17:08.217
What would you say is the biggest key to allowing

410
00:17:08.217 --> 00:17:11.076
somone to do that, unplug so to speak?

411
00:17:11.076 --> 00:17:13.996
<v ->Well, for me it's keeping our attention on our people.</v>

412
00:17:13.996 --> 00:17:17.936
Our primary goal is making sure that

413
00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:19.816
our people's lives are great.

414
00:17:19.816 --> 00:17:21.716
And, when their lives are great then they can put

415
00:17:21.716 --> 00:17:23.656
their attention on being of service.

416
00:17:23.656 --> 00:17:27.576
And so, I'd say our primary focus is inspiring people,

417
00:17:27.576 --> 00:17:29.877
supporting them in shifting their attention to all

418
00:17:29.877 --> 00:17:32.606
they have to be grateful for event though they maybe

419
00:17:32.606 --> 00:17:34.296
don't know how they're gonna pay rent, or somebody

420
00:17:34.296 --> 00:17:36.037
just stole their bicycle, or they've got

421
00:17:36.037 --> 00:17:37.836
a school loan to pay.

422
00:17:37.836 --> 00:17:40.897
We don't address the circumstances.

423
00:17:40.897 --> 00:17:43.657
It's like even in the midst of all the circumstances

424
00:17:43.657 --> 00:17:46.097
there are so many things that we can be grateful for

425
00:17:46.097 --> 00:17:48.877
and when you're attention's on gratitude you're here.

426
00:17:48.877 --> 00:17:52.137
So, you actually have all sorts of, a whole host

427
00:17:52.137 --> 00:17:55.337
of resources and power that's available to you

428
00:17:55.337 --> 00:17:59.877
that you wouldn't have available if you were just either

429
00:17:59.877 --> 00:18:03.497
in the past or in the future, either in fear or regret.

430
00:18:03.497 --> 00:18:06.437
And so, by being here you're an empowered human being

431
00:18:06.437 --> 00:18:08.557
and you can actually be up to something.

432
00:18:08.557 --> 00:18:10.377
You can take actions that are consistant with what

433
00:18:10.377 --> 00:18:11.677
you are committed too.

434
00:18:11.677 --> 00:18:13.917
I think that's the key piece of what we provide

435
00:18:13.917 --> 00:18:15.537
for our whole community.

436
00:18:15.537 --> 00:18:19.117
We started with 11 employees and I think we're at 227.

437
00:18:19.117 --> 00:18:21.917
So, it's a big community and a lot of people

438
00:18:21.917 --> 00:18:23.757
that are seeing work as an avenue

439
00:18:23.757 --> 00:18:26.058
for actually transforming their own lives.

440
00:18:26.058 --> 00:18:27.498
<v Regina>A lot of beautiful young people.</v>

441
00:18:27.498 --> 00:18:29.778
<v ->Beautiful young people, the most beautiful.</v>

442
00:18:29.778 --> 00:18:30.998
<v Regina>And, it gives you hope.</v>

443
00:18:30.998 --> 00:18:32.398
<v ->Yeah, it's so inspiring.</v>

444
00:18:32.398 --> 00:18:33.578
<v Regina>Any final thoughts?</v>

445
00:18:33.578 --> 00:18:35.278
And next, we're going to talk to your husband

446
00:18:35.278 --> 00:18:38.558
because we want to get into this business model aspect

447
00:18:38.558 --> 00:18:40.759
of transformation as well.

448
00:18:40.759 --> 00:18:44.419
<v ->I think what I'd share right now is just that I feel</v>

449
00:18:44.419 --> 00:18:48.485
fortunate, I feel fortunate that I've gone through

450
00:18:48.485 --> 00:18:50.465
everything that I've gone through in my life.

451
00:18:50.465 --> 00:18:52.545
And that now I have this opportunity to have that

452
00:18:52.545 --> 00:18:56.085
be a contribution to other people and to inspire

453
00:18:56.085 --> 00:18:59.745
other people to see their lives, there are degrees

454
00:18:59.745 --> 00:19:02.205
towards making a difference in the world.

455
00:19:02.205 --> 00:19:03.865
<v Regina>Very good, thank you so much.</v>

456
00:19:03.865 --> 00:19:06.316
<v ->Yeah, thank you, thank you for this opportunity.</v>

457
00:19:07.626 --> 00:19:09.866
<v Regina>So Matthew, as we're were talking off camera</v>

458
00:19:09.866 --> 00:19:12.906
a bit and you're literally granola from the ground up.

459
00:19:12.906 --> 00:19:14.386
You've kind of done it all.

460
00:19:14.386 --> 00:19:17.206
You're saying you've lived in a teepee, had a flax

461
00:19:17.206 --> 00:19:19.106
clothing company--

462
00:19:19.106 --> 00:19:22.346
<v ->Had a farm, built a stone house, but a log cabin,</v>

463
00:19:22.346 --> 00:19:24.917
had a natural clothing company.

464
00:19:25.827 --> 00:19:28.707
Yeah, I would say I'm a hippie.

465
00:19:28.707 --> 00:19:30.307
<v Regina>Yeah, you're a hippy okay.</v>

466
00:19:30.307 --> 00:19:32.547
But now, you're quite a successful hippie.

467
00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:35.807
<v ->For a while.
(laughs)

468
00:19:35.807 --> 00:19:38.087
<v Regina>So, let's look at that leap because that's a part</v>

469
00:19:38.087 --> 00:19:41.067
that seems to fall down, I was talking with Terces

470
00:19:41.067 --> 00:19:44.027
about that, a lot of people can get the, "Yeah, I need to

471
00:19:44.027 --> 00:19:45.507
"do something better with my life.

472
00:19:45.507 --> 00:19:48.927
"I don't wanna just focus on money as a means to an end."

473
00:19:48.927 --> 00:19:52.487
And then, all of a sudden, whoops everything's bye-bye.

474
00:19:52.487 --> 00:19:54.247
Now, they find themselves in debt.

475
00:19:54.247 --> 00:19:56.507
It's like, "Geez, my dream is not feeling as good as it did

476
00:19:56.507 --> 00:19:58.027
"when I thought of this."

477
00:19:58.027 --> 00:19:59.187
Why is that?

478
00:19:59.187 --> 00:20:01.507
What are the principles that are falling down

479
00:20:01.507 --> 00:20:03.487
in our search for consciousness?

480
00:20:03.487 --> 00:20:04.687
<v ->That's a great question.</v>

481
00:20:04.687 --> 00:20:06.487
So, if you've looked at my life, if you were a fly

482
00:20:06.487 --> 00:20:10.847
on the wall and looked at my life in 1984

483
00:20:10.847 --> 00:20:15.570
I was 25 or six, I had two children,

484
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:20.130
was a marginally good carpenter, maybe a B+ carpenter,

485
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.589
living very hand to mouth in an old farmhouse

486
00:20:23.589 --> 00:20:25.350
in upstate New York.

487
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.589
You know, very spiritual doing my sadhana,

488
00:20:27.589 --> 00:20:31.229
my meditation practices and barely making it financially.

489
00:20:31.229 --> 00:20:34.710
And, so you wouldn't be betting on me being a millionaire.

490
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:38.069
And, I picked up a book by John Randolph Price

491
00:20:38.069 --> 00:20:40.650
called the Manifestation Project,

492
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:43.090
Process, The Manifestation Process.

493
00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:46.710
And, I started reading it and it was like a light went off

494
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.430
like there's a spiritual world and there's a material world

495
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:51.970
and they can be the same world.

496
00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:53.710
I had them very separate.

497
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:57.710
In fact, I was hiding out in not succeeding

498
00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:00.530
because I didn't really want to fail, so spirituality

499
00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:03.710
really worked for me as a hideout.

500
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:06.611
And then, when I saw that, wow there are these two worlds

501
00:21:06.611 --> 00:21:10.592
and money can be a sacrament and money can be loved

502
00:21:10.592 --> 00:21:14.952
and just another expression of the essential nature

503
00:21:14.952 --> 00:21:19.372
of the universe, which is abundance, I was very lit up.

504
00:21:19.372 --> 00:21:23.671
And, I took it on like a career.

505
00:21:23.671 --> 00:21:27.271
And, I started being millionaire before millionaire

506
00:21:27.271 --> 00:21:28.112
showed up.

507
00:21:28.112 --> 00:21:31.512
I had a $400 Saab, which I drove around like a Mercedes.

508
00:21:31.512 --> 00:21:34.732
I had this Post-its, pre Post-its I had some kind

509
00:21:34.732 --> 00:21:36.472
of Post-its all over the house.

510
00:21:36.472 --> 00:21:38.572
"I love money and money loves me."

511
00:21:38.572 --> 00:21:41.192
And, "I'm a money magnet," and "I'm a millionaire."

512
00:21:41.192 --> 00:21:45.691
And, it really didn't go well in my kind of leftist

513
00:21:45.691 --> 00:21:47.132
Ithaca, New York community.

514
00:21:47.132 --> 00:21:49.692
People were like, "Oh, you love money, you've sold out."

515
00:21:49.692 --> 00:21:54.051
But, I just like fully went into it with no evidence.

516
00:21:54.051 --> 00:21:56.992
Started the being of millionaire before evidence

517
00:21:56.992 --> 00:21:58.251
of millionaire.

518
00:21:58.251 --> 00:22:00.572
And, that's really how the Universe works

519
00:22:00.572 --> 00:22:03.452
and millionaire showed up.

520
00:22:03.452 --> 00:22:08.154
Through miraculous, unpredictable ways

521
00:22:08.154 --> 00:22:11.854
I started on one treadle sewing maching we started

522
00:22:11.854 --> 00:22:14.895
a women's clothing company with my wife at that time

523
00:22:14.895 --> 00:22:17.194
and we grew it from one treadle sewing machine

524
00:22:17.194 --> 00:22:21.844
to a $28 million business a year, and highly profitable.

525
00:22:23.243 --> 00:22:25.323
<v Regina>And, when you say by one unexpected event</v>

526
00:22:25.323 --> 00:22:27.863
after, give us a couple of these things that happened

527
00:22:27.863 --> 00:22:30.303
because people often forget about the fact

528
00:22:30.303 --> 00:22:33.463
that if you allow it magic will come in it will intervene.

529
00:22:33.463 --> 00:22:38.063
<v ->Great, so it's like</v>

530
00:22:38.064 --> 00:22:41.764
maybe Monday and I have 30 employees

531
00:22:41.764 --> 00:22:46.424
and I know that I'm not gonna have enough money for payroll.

532
00:22:46.424 --> 00:22:48.624
And, this is when we were not successful yet,

533
00:22:48.624 --> 00:22:50.264
we were floundering.

534
00:22:50.264 --> 00:22:53.464
And, so I've got 30 women who are sewing for me

535
00:22:53.464 --> 00:22:55.864
that are my friends and they have mortgages

536
00:22:55.864 --> 00:22:58.984
and they have kids and I know that on Friday

537
00:22:58.984 --> 00:23:01.524
I'm not going to have money and I have idea what to do.

538
00:23:01.524 --> 00:23:04.824
And, I just gave my life over, I surrendered,

539
00:23:04.824 --> 00:23:08.624
I just said, "I don't know how to do this."

540
00:23:08.624 --> 00:23:11.984
And, literally the phone rang and this woman called

541
00:23:11.984 --> 00:23:16.984
from Syracuse and said, "I love what you guys are doing

542
00:23:16.984 --> 00:23:18.904
"and I really wanna be part of it and I can do

543
00:23:18.904 --> 00:23:20.604
"whatever I want."

544
00:23:20.604 --> 00:23:22.844
I said, "Come on down."
(laughs)

545
00:23:22.844 --> 00:23:26.164
And, she came down and introduced me to a friend,

546
00:23:26.164 --> 00:23:30.244
a potential investor who showed absolutely no interest

547
00:23:30.244 --> 00:23:31.384
in what we were doing.

548
00:23:31.384 --> 00:23:33.176
The only thing, he asked me one question as he looked

549
00:23:33.176 --> 00:23:35.656
around this old dairy barn and he goes, "I hope you have

550
00:23:35.656 --> 00:23:38.636
"fire insurance."
(laughs)

551
00:23:38.636 --> 00:23:42.296
Oh man, so now it's like Tuesday and I think, "Oh my god,

552
00:23:42.296 --> 00:23:44.016
"how am I going to, Friday I need money."

553
00:23:44.016 --> 00:23:46.716
So, I called this guy on the phone and said, "I wanna come

554
00:23:46.716 --> 00:23:49.356
"to Syracuse and present a proposal to you."

555
00:23:49.356 --> 00:23:53.236
And he was very resistant, but I got an appointment

556
00:23:53.236 --> 00:23:55.556
with him and I showed him our profit loss statement

557
00:23:55.556 --> 00:23:58.416
and our balance sheet which looked really grim,

558
00:23:58.416 --> 00:24:00.036
but I made this proposal.

559
00:24:00.036 --> 00:24:01.816
And he said, "Well, I'll think about," but the think

560
00:24:01.816 --> 00:24:04.408
about it was like, "I wanna get this guy out of here."

561
00:24:05.796 --> 00:24:08.798
And, then I called him on Thursday 'cause I didn't

562
00:24:08.798 --> 00:24:10.718
hear from him and I really needed the money

563
00:24:10.718 --> 00:24:12.878
and--
<v Regina>It's painful</v>

564
00:24:12.878 --> 00:24:14.398
listening to this.
<v ->He goes,</v>

565
00:24:14.398 --> 00:24:16.388
"You didn't give me much time to think about it," he said.

566
00:24:16.388 --> 00:24:19.358
And I said, "Phillip, not only didn't I give you much time

567
00:24:19.358 --> 00:24:22.098
"I need you to overnight me a check."

568
00:24:22.098 --> 00:24:24.758
Now, I found out later his lawyer told him not to do it

569
00:24:24.758 --> 00:24:28.678
and his attorney not to do it, but something inside him,

570
00:24:28.678 --> 00:24:33.000
some inner voice, and this is an engineer, has nothing

571
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
to do with a clothing company, a clothing business.

572
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.420
Had him write that check and out of that we created

573
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:44.710
a partnership and grew the business to massive success.

574
00:24:47.122 --> 00:24:49.562
You know Goethe says, "Boldness has magic in it"

575
00:24:49.562 --> 00:24:53.042
and that's a good example of how boldness has magic in it.

576
00:24:53.042 --> 00:24:54.782
<v Regina>Absolutely, wow.</v>

577
00:24:54.782 --> 00:24:57.893
In that moment most people's knees would be

578
00:24:58.564 --> 00:25:00.604
too rubbery to even ask, you know?

579
00:25:00.604 --> 00:25:01.944
But, you did it.

580
00:25:01.944 --> 00:25:04.264
So, tell me what you learned from that moment forward.

581
00:25:04.264 --> 00:25:06.985
And, tell the story of right through where you are today

582
00:25:06.985 --> 00:25:08.945
with this magnificent endeavor.

583
00:25:08.945 --> 00:25:12.885
<v ->Well, I mean there's another great story about</v>

584
00:25:12.885 --> 00:25:17.068
walking around New York and meeting this Afghani

585
00:25:17.938 --> 00:25:22.258
fabric sales person on 39th street and said, "I wanna take

586
00:25:22.258 --> 00:25:24.959
"you guys to Lithuania. Lithuania's where it's happening."

587
00:25:24.959 --> 00:25:27.078
This is right after the fall of the Soviet Union and there

588
00:25:27.078 --> 00:25:30.079
were all these idle linen factories and idle sewing

589
00:25:30.079 --> 00:25:32.110
factories and just massive opportunities.

590
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.069
<v Regina>And, you ran into him on the street, literally?</v>

591
00:25:34.069 --> 00:25:35.319
<v ->Well, we were shopping for fabric.</v>

592
00:25:35.319 --> 00:25:37.580
And somehow we said, "Okay, that sounds good."

593
00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:41.820
And, we went and out to of that we established

594
00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:46.520
a 250 women owned, worker run sewing factory

595
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.892
in Lithuania that produced all our goods over the next

596
00:25:49.892 --> 00:25:53.452
10, 15 years and we were able to like really bring up

597
00:25:53.452 --> 00:25:55.472
their economy and help them.

598
00:25:55.472 --> 00:25:58.034
At one time we were the number on export,

599
00:25:58.034 --> 00:26:00.933
our company was the number one exporter

600
00:26:00.933 --> 00:26:03.194
to the U.S., we both the most goods from Lithuania

601
00:26:03.194 --> 00:26:06.714
than any other company.

602
00:26:06.714 --> 00:26:09.994
And, we created long term relationships with these people

603
00:26:09.994 --> 00:26:13.074
they came to Terces and my wedding, two of them

604
00:26:13.975 --> 00:26:15.216
five years ago.

605
00:26:15.216 --> 00:26:18.516
And, we had such great prices that we were just like

606
00:26:18.516 --> 00:26:21.955
massively successful, and that was just a complete miracle.

607
00:26:21.955 --> 00:26:24.155
So, I think it's surrendering.

608
00:26:26.156 --> 00:26:28.555
It's double-headed, it's I have this intention.

609
00:26:28.555 --> 00:26:30.196
"Hmm, let's have this raw food restaurant."

610
00:26:30.196 --> 00:26:33.275
And also it's up to the universe.

611
00:26:33.275 --> 00:26:36.396
I can't see anything so it's this double-headed place

612
00:26:36.396 --> 00:26:39.256
of having some attention and also surrendering

613
00:26:39.256 --> 00:26:40.395
to whatever.

614
00:26:40.395 --> 00:26:42.855
Having some attention, not just surrendering to whatever,

615
00:26:42.855 --> 00:26:46.676
using your god worship power to have an intention

616
00:26:46.676 --> 00:26:49.536
but not be so attached to your intention that you're not

617
00:26:49.536 --> 00:26:51.707
open to something even better.

618
00:26:52.937 --> 00:26:55.992
So, I think that's--

619
00:26:55.992 --> 00:26:57.452
<v Regina>That's huge.</v>
<v ->That's huge.</v>

620
00:26:57.452 --> 00:26:58.772
<v Regina>So, let's tak it into--</v>

621
00:26:58.772 --> 00:27:00.832
<v ->I'm always being trained and I haven't mastered it.</v>

622
00:27:00.832 --> 00:27:03.673
It's always on going even now.

623
00:27:03.673 --> 00:27:05.693
Because, here's the thing, you get to a certain level

624
00:27:05.693 --> 00:27:07.713
then you play a bigger game and "Ah," you get overwhelmed

625
00:27:07.713 --> 00:27:08.473
by that game.

626
00:27:08.473 --> 00:27:09.665
You get comfortable in that game,

627
00:27:09.665 --> 00:27:10.670
then it becomes a bigger game.

628
00:27:10.673 --> 00:27:13.174
Now, we're talking about buying a farm

629
00:27:13.174 --> 00:27:16.976
and having a community and the farm community's

630
00:27:16.976 --> 00:27:19.375
supplying all all Cafe Gratitude's with food.

631
00:27:19.375 --> 00:27:21.015
I mean--
<v Regina>It's big.</v>

632
00:27:21.015 --> 00:27:23.516
<v ->It get's wilder and wilder.
<v Regina>Big concept.</v>

633
00:27:24.575 --> 00:27:28.216
<v ->There's a line from a Rumi poem that goes like this,</v>

634
00:27:28.216 --> 00:27:32.735
"Start some big foolish project like Noah."

635
00:27:32.735 --> 00:27:33.755
(laughs)

636
00:27:33.755 --> 00:27:34.977
<v ->This is our big, foolish project.</v>

637
00:27:34.977 --> 00:27:36.928
<v Regina>Oh, I got you on that one.</v>

638
00:27:37.978 --> 00:27:41.117
<v ->So, with your big foolish project you were sitting there</v>

639
00:27:41.117 --> 00:27:43.818
together and you created the board game and now

640
00:27:43.818 --> 00:27:46.277
she's thinking, "Okay, let's do a bakery."

641
00:27:48.317 --> 00:27:50.241
Let's talk about from you in a business model

642
00:27:50.241 --> 00:27:52.001
what happened next?

643
00:27:53.042 --> 00:27:56.664
<v ->Well, we just had the intention, "Okay, we're going to</v>

644
00:27:56.664 --> 00:28:00.404
"open this raw food gaming parlor, this gaming parlor,

645
00:28:00.404 --> 00:28:02.064
"transformational gaming parlor."

646
00:28:02.064 --> 00:28:04.715
And, we just held space for it

647
00:28:05.946 --> 00:28:08.385
and one day a friend of ours said,

648
00:28:08.385 --> 00:28:10.157
"When are you going to open this thing?

649
00:28:10.787 --> 00:28:12.327
"I think you're just talking."

650
00:28:12.327 --> 00:28:15.827
And I said to her, "Henri, when we have a sign from God

651
00:28:15.827 --> 00:28:17.766
"we'll open this restaurant."

652
00:28:17.766 --> 00:28:21.426
And the next day, like less than 12 hours later

653
00:28:21.426 --> 00:28:23.866
we're driving down Harrison Street and there's a sign

654
00:28:23.866 --> 00:28:26.866
on a building that says, "Restaurant available."

655
00:28:26.866 --> 00:28:27.946
<v Regina>Wow.</v>

656
00:28:27.946 --> 00:28:31.366
<v ->And we looked at it and signed a lease and we started.</v>

657
00:28:31.366 --> 00:28:35.746
And, I think what stops some people is this idea

658
00:28:35.746 --> 00:28:37.987
of failure means something.

659
00:28:37.987 --> 00:28:40.778
See, I got complete with failure a long time ago.

660
00:28:40.778 --> 00:28:43.377
Failure doesn't mean anything except, "I didn't do

661
00:28:43.377 --> 00:28:44.878
"what I said I was going to do."

662
00:28:44.878 --> 00:28:48.137
But, it doesn't mean all the other stuff, "Oh, I'm no good.

663
00:28:48.137 --> 00:28:50.097
"I'll never make it."

664
00:28:50.097 --> 00:28:54.677
That's all some egoic, you know, indulgence.

665
00:28:54.677 --> 00:28:57.057
Failure doesn't mean anything.

666
00:28:57.057 --> 00:29:00.118
So, if it doesn't mean anything what's there to fear?

667
00:29:00.118 --> 00:29:01.718
Just go for it.

668
00:29:01.718 --> 00:29:03.717
I got complete with failure a long time ago.

669
00:29:03.717 --> 00:29:06.817
So now, it's like I'm happy to say, "I failed!

670
00:29:06.817 --> 00:29:09.988
"I made a mistake." It's no big deal.

671
00:29:09.988 --> 00:29:11.477
<v Regina>But, isn't that the same part of</v>

672
00:29:11.477 --> 00:29:13.876
the consciousness I was talking with Terces about

673
00:29:13.876 --> 00:29:16.456
where we can say, "Oh, I'm fat. Oh, look at my butt

674
00:29:16.456 --> 00:29:17.795
"in the rearview mirror."

675
00:29:17.795 --> 00:29:21.696
And yet, at the same time you can't say, "Oh, I'm lovely."

676
00:29:21.696 --> 00:29:25.596
Isn't that the same part, just another expression of ego?

677
00:29:25.596 --> 00:29:26.556
<v ->Yes.</v>

678
00:29:26.556 --> 00:29:29.255
<v ->Accepting, I mean in this case actually attaching</v>

679
00:29:29.255 --> 00:29:30.956
to the failure even more so.

680
00:29:30.956 --> 00:29:32.975
<v ->That's right, that's right and it's just a matter</v>

681
00:29:32.975 --> 00:29:34.096
of practice.

682
00:29:34.096 --> 00:29:38.296
See, we're the Michael Jordan's of, "I'm not enough."

683
00:29:38.296 --> 00:29:42.636
We've practiced that, that shot we just got that one down.

684
00:29:42.636 --> 00:29:46.216
And, it seems real, it seems authentic even

685
00:29:46.216 --> 00:29:49.035
because we've practiced it so much.

686
00:29:49.035 --> 00:29:51.636
It's just a matter of practicing something else.

687
00:29:51.636 --> 00:29:53.456
"I'm adorable."

688
00:29:53.456 --> 00:29:55.336
You could practice, it's gonna sound weird at first.

689
00:29:55.336 --> 00:29:56.756
It does sound weird, "I'm adorable."

690
00:29:56.756 --> 00:29:59.736
You practice it enough, "I'm adorable," is just being.

691
00:29:59.736 --> 00:30:01.615
It's true.
(laughs)

692
00:30:01.615 --> 00:30:05.656
<v Regina>So, with Cafe Gratitude now you're, it looks like</v>

693
00:30:05.656 --> 00:30:08.397
you've got a model that's actually sustainable.

694
00:30:08.397 --> 00:30:11.077
Can you talk a little bit about sustainability here?

695
00:30:11.077 --> 00:30:12.748
Sure, so

696
00:30:16.398 --> 00:30:17.515
the model that we have

697
00:30:17.515 --> 00:30:19.476
is that we have a central kitchen where all the food

698
00:30:19.476 --> 00:30:23.416
is processed and stored and comes into and proceesed

699
00:30:23.416 --> 00:30:26.415
and then it gets shipped out to the four cafes.

700
00:30:26.415 --> 00:30:29.696
And, because we have that central kitchen gives us

701
00:30:29.696 --> 00:30:33.395
an economy of scale and that's been really, really good.

702
00:30:33.395 --> 00:30:36.676
It also frees up a square footage at the restaurants

703
00:30:36.676 --> 00:30:40.716
for retail and tables rather than each store has it's own

704
00:30:40.716 --> 00:30:43.692
inventory and it's own little thing going on.

705
00:30:43.692 --> 00:30:45.492
So, that's one way that--

706
00:30:45.492 --> 00:30:46.941
<v Regina>Can I ask a question?</v>

707
00:30:46.941 --> 00:30:47.962
<v ->Yeah.
<v Regina>I've always</v>

708
00:30:47.962 --> 00:30:50.751
wondered when we've gone into there I ordered this one

709
00:30:50.751 --> 00:30:55.132
particular shake that you make that has raw coconut in it,

710
00:30:55.132 --> 00:30:57.892
fresh coconut, the soft, baby coconut meat

711
00:30:57.892 --> 00:31:00.632
and I thought how in the world would they ever have time

712
00:31:00.632 --> 00:31:01.771
to do that back there.

713
00:31:01.771 --> 00:31:04.131
So, would say when you say processing that perhaps

714
00:31:04.131 --> 00:31:07.051
a lot of that has already been done in advance?

715
00:31:07.051 --> 00:31:09.711
<v ->There's a guy named Jesus that starts cutting those things</v>

716
00:31:09.711 --> 00:31:14.323
open about 10pm the night before, so yes.

717
00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:18.133
Maybe for five or six hours all he does is open coconuts

718
00:31:18.133 --> 00:31:19.053
and scrape them.

719
00:31:19.053 --> 00:31:21.653
<v Regina>Oh my god, I thought how can they do this?</v>

720
00:31:21.653 --> 00:31:26.206
I mean, you have to pay for it, this is not a cheap,

721
00:31:27.173 --> 00:31:29.544
shall we say, not a scale we're used to when you go

722
00:31:29.544 --> 00:31:32.104
into a restaurant and get something that you pour out

723
00:31:32.104 --> 00:31:34.184
of a carton that has a long shelf life.

724
00:31:34.184 --> 00:31:36.224
You have to pay for it, but you're paying for quality.

725
00:31:36.224 --> 00:31:39.064
You're paying time, you're paying for nature.

726
00:31:39.064 --> 00:31:42.464
I mean this is really, to me, so worth it.

727
00:31:42.464 --> 00:31:46.764
<v ->Yes, yeah well we say you always pay somewhere.</v>

728
00:31:46.764 --> 00:31:50.104
So, you know, if you're not paying for organic then

729
00:31:50.104 --> 00:31:55.004
you're paying for a contaminated field and you're paying for

730
00:31:55.004 --> 00:31:59.324
an illegal immegrant that's got poisoned by

731
00:31:59.324 --> 00:32:01.484
methyl-bromide or you're paying--

732
00:32:01.484 --> 00:32:02.464
<v Regina>And doctor bills.</v>

733
00:32:02.464 --> 00:32:04.044
<v ->You're paying for ground water clean-up.</v>

734
00:32:04.044 --> 00:32:07.824
You're paying for doctor bills, you know, you're always

735
00:32:07.824 --> 00:32:08.764
paying somewhere.

736
00:32:08.764 --> 00:32:11.504
Like, when you put something in your body that your

737
00:32:11.504 --> 00:32:13.824
body doesn't want, you pay, somewhere along the line

738
00:32:13.824 --> 00:32:14.784
you pay.

739
00:32:14.784 --> 00:32:16.904
You're paying in your health, so--

740
00:32:16.904 --> 00:32:20.024
<v Regina>Let's talk about that, that whole notion of value</v>

741
00:32:20.024 --> 00:32:24.384
because a lot of times and particularly with the spiritual,

742
00:32:24.384 --> 00:32:26.904
the growth of the spiritual consciousness movement

743
00:32:26.904 --> 00:32:29.484
there is a poverty mentality often attached to it.

744
00:32:29.484 --> 00:32:32.604
Again, because of having broken away from the known,

745
00:32:32.604 --> 00:32:35.384
which is I do that for a paycheck, and you expect

746
00:32:35.384 --> 00:32:36.724
an end result.

747
00:32:36.724 --> 00:32:38.984
Can you talk about your perception and how you really

748
00:32:38.984 --> 00:32:42.644
have overcome that and really you're thriving?

749
00:32:45.334 --> 00:32:48.839
<v ->When a customer has some resistance to our prices,</v>

750
00:32:48.839 --> 00:32:52.444
which I think considering what we sell are completely

751
00:32:52.444 --> 00:32:55.084
reasonable, we have a couple responses.

752
00:32:55.084 --> 00:32:58.764
We say, "Thank you for being worthy of the best food

753
00:32:58.764 --> 00:33:00.264
"on the planet."

754
00:33:00.264 --> 00:33:02.524
Or we say, "Thank you for taking care of yourself

755
00:33:02.524 --> 00:33:04.024
"and the planet."

756
00:33:04.024 --> 00:33:08.385
Because, see the pickle we're in is that

757
00:33:08.385 --> 00:33:11.685
we're all living these little individual lives with

758
00:33:11.685 --> 00:33:14.285
our own car and our own apartment, and our own TV set.

759
00:33:14.285 --> 00:33:16.085
It's just not working anymore.

760
00:33:16.085 --> 00:33:17.585
<v Regina>It's not sustainable.</v>

761
00:33:17.585 --> 00:33:20.585
<v ->So, all that's telling us is that we need to attentive</v>

762
00:33:20.585 --> 00:33:23.525
to the whole, to everyone, everyone has to win.

763
00:33:23.525 --> 00:33:25.205
All species have to win.

764
00:33:28.746 --> 00:33:32.725
If you look at your diet from what's the impact

765
00:33:32.725 --> 00:33:35.986
on the entire planet this would be the diet you'd pick.

766
00:33:35.986 --> 00:33:38.346
If it's just about your checking account, no you pick

767
00:33:38.346 --> 00:33:41.425
some other diet, but that's not working anymore.

768
00:33:41.425 --> 00:33:44.986
And, it's getting so loud, the volume is getting so loud

769
00:33:44.986 --> 00:33:48.025
on the unworkability of that that people are starting

770
00:33:48.025 --> 00:33:49.766
to wake up.

771
00:33:49.766 --> 00:33:52.965
And now, with a healthcare system that's about to implode

772
00:33:54.425 --> 00:33:58.472
self-care, now you watch the buzz word in the next

773
00:33:58.472 --> 00:34:01.411
ten years is gonna be self-care about we have to be

774
00:34:01.411 --> 00:34:03.271
responsible for our own health.

775
00:34:03.271 --> 00:34:05.651
The reason healthcare costs so much and it's not available

776
00:34:05.651 --> 00:34:08.451
to everyone is we've got so many people that aren't

777
00:34:08.451 --> 00:34:10.071
responsible for their health.

778
00:34:10.071 --> 00:34:12.331
<v Regina>Absolutely, and it starts with what you put</v>

779
00:34:12.331 --> 00:34:13.411
in your body.

780
00:34:13.411 --> 00:34:14.891
<v ->It's a good start, yes.</v>

781
00:34:14.891 --> 00:34:17.631
<v Regina>And so the sustainability really reaches,</v>

782
00:34:17.631 --> 00:34:19.571
when you take responsibility with the type of food

783
00:34:19.571 --> 00:34:21.290
you're going to eat and the quality of food,

784
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:24.390
like what you have in your restaurant you're really

785
00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:27.551
taking responsibility for the healing of, not just your body

786
00:34:27.551 --> 00:34:30.151
and you family, but of the planet itself.

787
00:34:30.151 --> 00:34:32.071
<v ->That's right, yep.</v>

788
00:34:32.071 --> 00:34:35.871
So, how do you see the future of this, like you said,

789
00:34:35.871 --> 00:34:39.590
you're thinking of a farm and I assume I heard opening

790
00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:42.911
new restaurants, one right near us, I'm so excited.

791
00:34:42.911 --> 00:34:44.931
Although, I gotta get the cookbook because I know

792
00:34:44.931 --> 00:34:48.691
how to cook, I can probably whip up a few things at home

793
00:34:48.691 --> 00:34:50.851
between trips to the restaurant.

794
00:34:50.851 --> 00:34:51.751
What are you thinking?

795
00:34:51.751 --> 00:34:53.151
How far do you want to go with this?

796
00:34:53.151 --> 00:34:56.550
<v ->You know again, it's like we're not really interested</v>

797
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:59.271
in being in the restaurant business, but we are in

798
00:34:59.271 --> 00:35:00.851
the transformation business.

799
00:35:00.851 --> 00:35:03.251
And, we categorize as actually a school of transformation,

800
00:35:03.251 --> 00:35:06.871
we actually see every employee as a student.

801
00:35:06.871 --> 00:35:11.091
And, in the next, maybe by January or maybe February 1st

802
00:35:11.091 --> 00:35:13.650
when you become an employee of Cafe Gratitude

803
00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:16.491
we're gonna hand you a curriculum.

804
00:35:16.491 --> 00:35:18.430
And, we're gonna say, "This is what we offer,

805
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:21.091
"these are the distinctions, this is what you can get.

806
00:35:21.091 --> 00:35:23.522
"You wanna work here a year, by the end of the year

807
00:35:24.692 --> 00:35:27.911
"you'll have transcended being right," for instance.

808
00:35:27.911 --> 00:35:29.911
That's one of the distinctions we teach.

809
00:35:29.911 --> 00:35:33.872
Being right is we call it the heroine for human beings.

810
00:35:33.872 --> 00:35:36.712
Human beings are addicted to being right.

811
00:35:36.712 --> 00:35:39.231
As a couple, you've probably noticed you start arguing

812
00:35:39.231 --> 00:35:41.563
with each and you just keep going and going.

813
00:35:43.242 --> 00:35:45.393
<v Regina>And, it's like what were we talking about?</v>

814
00:35:45.393 --> 00:35:47.652
It wasn't even important.

815
00:35:47.652 --> 00:35:49.633
<v ->So, what are we more committed too, being right</v>

816
00:35:49.633 --> 00:35:53.113
or being kind, or being right or workability?

817
00:35:53.113 --> 00:35:57.693
So, that's just one tidbit of what the kinds of distinctions

818
00:35:57.693 --> 00:36:01.673
as an employee you would actually learn to actually get.

819
00:36:01.673 --> 00:36:06.472
"Oh, wow being right is a mechanism that I have,

820
00:36:06.472 --> 00:36:08.553
"but it doesn't work.

821
00:36:08.553 --> 00:36:11.353
"In fact, I suffer, everyone suffer's including myself

822
00:36:11.353 --> 00:36:15.552
"when I get into that indulgence, that habitual pattern."

823
00:36:15.552 --> 00:36:19.833
So, the reason we would be interested in expanding

824
00:36:19.833 --> 00:36:23.393
is to have more impact, more transformation.

825
00:36:23.393 --> 00:36:26.213
And then, having the model, we have a book coming out

826
00:36:26.213 --> 00:36:29.133
called Sacred Commerce in summer of 08 about how

827
00:36:29.133 --> 00:36:32.473
to bring the sacred, how to bring this sacred model

828
00:36:32.473 --> 00:36:35.492
of business into any business.
<v Regina>That's wonderful.</v>

829
00:36:35.492 --> 00:36:38.993
<v ->And, we are teaching a workshop, a three day workshop</v>

830
00:36:38.993 --> 00:36:41.223
for businesses called Sacred Commerce.

831
00:36:42.234 --> 00:36:44.774
<v Regina>Sounds good, sounds like a lot of people</v>

832
00:36:44.774 --> 00:36:48.313
we know in this whole genre could use that.

833
00:36:48.313 --> 00:36:49.934
<v ->Yeah, we did that.</v>

834
00:36:49.934 --> 00:36:52.414
We gave the first one at Omega Institute in Rhinebeck

835
00:36:52.414 --> 00:36:53.454
this summer.

836
00:36:53.454 --> 00:36:55.263
<v Regina>Okay, and it's well attended and are people</v>

837
00:36:55.263 --> 00:36:56.874
prospering as a result of it?

838
00:36:56.874 --> 00:36:58.574
<v ->Well, it's too early to tell it was just a couple</v>

839
00:36:58.574 --> 00:37:00.434
months ago, but I think so.

840
00:37:00.434 --> 00:37:01.634
<v Regina>Oh, I see okay.</v>

841
00:37:01.634 --> 00:37:03.994
Well, any final thoughts on this and what your intention

842
00:37:03.994 --> 00:37:05.994
is for the world and what you'd like to see happen

843
00:37:05.994 --> 00:37:08.393
as a result of your presence and Terces presence

844
00:37:08.393 --> 00:37:10.673
and your employees' presence in the world.

845
00:37:10.673 --> 00:37:13.064
<v ->Well, I think community.</v>

846
00:37:13.834 --> 00:37:16.975
I think that community is the only way out.

847
00:37:16.975 --> 00:37:21.414
That this little mine and yours and individual

848
00:37:21.414 --> 00:37:24.815
is just not, first of all it's not working.

849
00:37:24.815 --> 00:37:28.065
And really, people actually wanna live in family.

850
00:37:29.214 --> 00:37:32.095
I have a saying that goes something like, "We really want

851
00:37:32.095 --> 00:37:34.515
"to take care of each other, but we're afraid."

852
00:37:34.515 --> 00:37:36.375
We're afraid that we're gonna get ripped off,

853
00:37:36.375 --> 00:37:39.715
or the love won't be, what's the word?

854
00:37:39.715 --> 00:37:41.535
<v Regina>Reciprocated.</v>
<v ->Reciprocated.</v>

855
00:37:41.535 --> 00:37:44.595
And, the thing is someone has to start first.

856
00:37:44.595 --> 00:37:49.260
And, to be a leader is to, it's not always

857
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.779
gonna be equal.

858
00:37:50.779 --> 00:37:53.459
You know, some people are gonna work harder than others,

859
00:37:53.459 --> 00:37:54.239
big deal.

860
00:37:54.239 --> 00:37:56.640
In every family some people work harder, some people

861
00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.699
drag the family down, big deal.

862
00:37:58.699 --> 00:38:00.960
If you want workability we're gonna have to start

863
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.560
creating bigger and bigger family units and bigger,

864
00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:07.539
and bigger communities that actually are committed

865
00:38:07.539 --> 00:38:09.279
to workability for everybody.

866
00:38:09.279 --> 00:38:11.809
And that's, we're doing it in the workplace.

867
00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.080
<v ->If you have gifts to give I would highly recommend</v>

868
00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.659
the Cafe Gratitude cookbook for anyone interested

869
00:38:20.659 --> 00:38:23.160
in raw cuisine, it's mouthwatering.

870
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.130
For conscious interaction with others you can also

871
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:27.430
