00:00:00.663 --> 00:00:02.934 line:15% 
<v ->In our last conversation with Thom Rogers,</v>

2
00:00:02.934 --> 00:00:04.470
we spoke of how the quantum field

3
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.966
can be programmed to eliminate impediments

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.494
to both healing bodies and businesses.

5
00:00:09.494 --> 00:00:11.585
In this interview, we speak of the means

6
00:00:11.585 --> 00:00:14.816
by which this programming occurs, scalar waves.

7
00:00:14.816 --> 00:00:17.366
Scalar waves are ubiquitous, little understood

8
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.669
by lay people, and a very powerful force

9
00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.643
that works with consciousness

10
00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:24.142
to move a potential into manifestation.

11
00:00:25.242 --> 00:00:27.776 line:15% 
(soft, upbeat music)

12
00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:36.961
<v ->So, last time we spoke, we were talking</v>

13
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:39.510
about invisible information systems

14
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.622
that we're calling scalar waves,

15
00:00:41.622 --> 00:00:43.435
that not only have the capability of,

16
00:00:43.435 --> 00:00:45.365
we can draw on them to heal not only ourselves,

17
00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:47.797
but even our businesses, which is where we picked up

18
00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:49.098
in the last conversation.

19
00:00:49.098 --> 00:00:50.965
But still, almost nobody knows

20
00:00:50.965 --> 00:00:53.301
what a scalar wave is, right?

21
00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:54.602
<v ->I don't know.</v>

22
00:00:54.602 --> 00:00:57.629
<v ->It's very difficult to define.</v>

23
00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.890
Because this is such a powerful element

24
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.303
of how we create everything around us,

25
00:01:04.303 --> 00:01:06.372
everything in the universe is created,

26
00:01:06.372 --> 00:01:08.025
I think it would be really good if you

27
00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:10.276
give us a little primer course in scalar waves.

28
00:01:10.276 --> 00:01:12.921
<v ->(chuckles) Well, I don't know how many people</v>

29
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:14.244
know about scalar waves,

30
00:01:14.244 --> 00:01:18.006
but I would imagine it's a few compared to the population.

31
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:21.348
Even for myself, you know, I've gone through years

32
00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:24.638
of accumulating bits and pieces of information.

33
00:01:26.428 --> 00:01:28.469
I think before I give a definition--

34
00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.282
well, let me give a definition first.

35
00:01:30.282 --> 00:01:33.869
So, Glen Rein, who's a scientist out here in California,

36
00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.202
gave a definition that goes something like this.

37
00:01:36.202 --> 00:01:40.192
A scalar wave is a non-electromagnetic field

38
00:01:40.192 --> 00:01:43.445
that carries information and/or other

39
00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:47.114
forms of consciousness, and it's independent

40
00:01:47.114 --> 00:01:49.204
of time and space.

41
00:01:50.204 --> 00:01:52.576
And so that's really a good starting definition

42
00:01:52.576 --> 00:01:54.272
for what a scalar wave might be.

43
00:01:54.272 --> 00:01:57.429
<v ->So, really, the key words that I'm picking up there</v>

44
00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.189
is it interfaces with consciousness.

45
00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:01.328
<v ->It does.</v>

46
00:02:01.328 --> 00:02:03.717
It definitely interfaces with consciousness.

47
00:02:03.717 --> 00:02:05.093
And it's really, in a way,

48
00:02:05.093 --> 00:02:07.482
it's an expression out of consciousness.

49
00:02:08.222 --> 00:02:09.802
<v ->So, we're talking about moving beyond</v>

50
00:02:09.802 --> 00:02:12.128
a time space continuum, time and space

51
00:02:12.128 --> 00:02:13.568
as we know it.

52
00:02:13.568 --> 00:02:15.871
The rules don't apply on scalar waves.

53
00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:17.963
<v Thom>That's correct.</v>
<v ->Time and space do not apply.</v>

54
00:02:17.963 --> 00:02:20.384
Consciousness does apply.

55
00:02:20.384 --> 00:02:22.838
<v ->Well, time and space are independent,</v>

56
00:02:22.838 --> 00:02:25.835
but time plays very heavily into

57
00:02:25.835 --> 00:02:28.555
the formation of scalar waves.

58
00:02:28.555 --> 00:02:30.091
<v ->Okay, let's just dive into it.</v>

59
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:33.525
Let's talk about what scalar waves are,

60
00:02:33.525 --> 00:02:36.010
first of all, when they were even

61
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.186
first noticed on a scientific level,

62
00:02:38.186 --> 00:02:39.765
and how we're utilizing them.

63
00:02:39.765 --> 00:02:42.054
And I know that the people out there

64
00:02:42.054 --> 00:02:43.316
who are listening to this,

65
00:02:43.316 --> 00:02:44.955
who actually have heard of scalar waves,

66
00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:46.566
have probably heard of it

67
00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:50.111
in the context of black ops technology,

68
00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:53.371
more hidden agendas and projects and so forth.

69
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:54.833
That's not what we're talking about here.

70
00:02:54.833 --> 00:02:55.483
<v ->No.</v>

71
00:02:55.483 --> 00:02:57.921
<v ->We're going to go into the positive applications of it</v>

72
00:02:57.921 --> 00:02:59.756
after we define what exactly it is.

73
00:02:59.756 --> 00:03:01.910
And I think, by defining it, people will be able

74
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.862
to understand how this could be used

75
00:03:03.862 --> 00:03:06.678
to the better of mankind or for the worse.

76
00:03:06.678 --> 00:03:08.299
<v ->Well, we're going to concentrate</v>

77
00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.294
on creation and improvement of life,

78
00:03:10.294 --> 00:03:12.011
because that's really what everybody's focus is

79
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:14.688
and this arena really wants to do.

80
00:03:14.688 --> 00:03:16.480
That immature souls, and I don't really

81
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.962
want to make judgment, but often times

82
00:03:17.962 --> 00:03:19.722
the immature soul needs to find out

83
00:03:19.722 --> 00:03:21.610
how power can be misused,

84
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.970
and sometimes they go down that avenue.

85
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.186
But for this purpose,

86
00:03:26.186 --> 00:03:29.268
and for the purpose of how we're using scalar waves,

87
00:03:29.268 --> 00:03:30.964
first of all, I just want to say,

88
00:03:30.964 --> 00:03:33.097
scalar waves are used in our work

89
00:03:33.097 --> 00:03:34.591
as a reinforcement.

90
00:03:34.591 --> 00:03:37.183
The genius of the whole system

91
00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:39.700
that we utilize in helping a business

92
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.598
accelerate its success,

93
00:03:41.598 --> 00:03:44.830
has to do with the way that we are focusing

94
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.539
on putting information onto the scalar wave.

95
00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:49.726
We're just using it as a carrier wave.

96
00:03:50.636 --> 00:03:52.937
But, that aside, let's talk about

97
00:03:52.937 --> 00:03:54.664
scalar waves in general, too.

98
00:03:55.564 --> 00:03:58.732
You asked about the scientific basis.

99
00:03:58.732 --> 00:04:02.689
Maxwell was a man who lived in the 1800s,

100
00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.795
and around the mid-1800s, he speculated

101
00:04:06.795 --> 00:04:09.163
on the idea that there may be such a thing

102
00:04:09.163 --> 00:04:11.488
as what we're now calling a scalar wave.

103
00:04:11.488 --> 00:04:13.227
So, that's its origins.

104
00:04:13.227 --> 00:04:16.874
In the very early 1900s, like 1902,

105
00:04:16.874 --> 00:04:19.189
a man, I think by the name of Haybor,

106
00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:22.143
wrote two articles in papers

107
00:04:22.143 --> 00:04:23.903
and published them as a scientist

108
00:04:23.903 --> 00:04:26.975
on what we now call scalar waves.

109
00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:29.151
But, more exciting, in 1899,

110
00:04:29.151 --> 00:04:31.103
on July 3rd and July 4th,

111
00:04:31.103 --> 00:04:34.708
Nikola Telsa, who most people have heard of

112
00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:37.556
if they're--
<v ->Tesla, mmhm, yes, of course.</v>

113
00:04:37.556 --> 00:04:42.121
<v ->He demonstrated the existence of scalar waves.</v>

114
00:04:42.121 --> 00:04:43.742
<v ->Okay, how did he do this?</v>

115
00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:46.206
The neat thing about referring to Tesla is,

116
00:04:46.206 --> 00:04:47.870
enough people have seen documentaries

117
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.342
and we've seen some of the effects

118
00:04:49.342 --> 00:04:50.942
of the energies he was working with,

119
00:04:50.942 --> 00:04:53.054
so we can get a visual on this.

120
00:04:53.054 --> 00:04:55.443
I think it's hard for people to comprehend

121
00:04:55.443 --> 00:04:57.907
because we can't get a mental visual

122
00:04:57.907 --> 00:05:00.989
of something so pervasive.

123
00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:02.205
<v ->That's true.</v>

124
00:05:02.205 --> 00:05:03.037
<v ->And invisible.</v>

125
00:05:03.037 --> 00:05:03.890
<v ->That's true.</v>

126
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.479
<v ->So, let's pick it up from Tesla, then.</v>

127
00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:06.802
<v ->Oh, like I'm going to be able to come up</v>

128
00:05:06.802 --> 00:05:08.797
with all the answers.
(both laugh)

129
00:05:08.797 --> 00:05:12.604
Well, first of all, I wasn't there in 1899.

130
00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:14.226
<v ->Right.
<v Thom>When that was done.</v>

131
00:05:14.226 --> 00:05:15.693
<v ->Right, right, we'll give you that. (chuckles)</v>

132
00:05:15.693 --> 00:05:17.539
<v ->(chuckling) Thank you so much.</v>

133
00:05:19.549 --> 00:05:20.606
And that's just it.

134
00:05:20.606 --> 00:05:23.603
With a scalar wave, you can demonstrate that it exists.

135
00:05:23.603 --> 00:05:26.482
But it's very difficult to

136
00:05:27.342 --> 00:05:31.169
recreate it in such a way that you can prove it.

137
00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.844
Because it's coming beyond the dimensions

138
00:05:32.844 --> 00:05:35.489
of everything that we use in physics,

139
00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:37.526
or in science, to measure.

140
00:05:37.526 --> 00:05:39.137
In other words, anything didactic,

141
00:05:39.137 --> 00:05:40.992
or dual, or binary in nature,

142
00:05:40.992 --> 00:05:43.264
that we're using in all of these instruments

143
00:05:43.264 --> 00:05:44.747
to measure all these different forms

144
00:05:44.747 --> 00:05:48.043
of electromagnetic spectrums and outputs of energy,

145
00:05:48.043 --> 00:05:51.018
they're all able to meausre the effect

146
00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:53.600
of what we call, what is called the foam.

147
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.223
It's a layer of foam that goes around the Earth,

148
00:05:56.223 --> 00:05:58.655
and, essentially, it's a metaphor.

149
00:05:58.655 --> 00:05:59.957
It's almost like the shaving cream foam

150
00:05:59.957 --> 00:06:01.332
that you put on your face.

151
00:06:01.332 --> 00:06:03.700
It's the soup of which everything

152
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.695
is being researched and studied about,

153
00:06:05.695 --> 00:06:08.873
but it's only on a level of the surface.

154
00:06:08.873 --> 00:06:10.729
And, if you look deeper and deeper

155
00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.065
from which the scalar wave comes from,

156
00:06:13.065 --> 00:06:15.134
this is the universal field.

157
00:06:15.134 --> 00:06:18.474
And this is the field that has unlimited potential.

158
00:06:18.474 --> 00:06:20.862
And so, the only thing that this field

159
00:06:20.862 --> 00:06:23.118
really has is magnitude.

160
00:06:23.118 --> 00:06:26.214
Which, in a sense, could be somewhat measured.

161
00:06:26.214 --> 00:06:28.833
And that's the idea that it can fill space,

162
00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:30.944
and it does so in concentric circles.

163
00:06:30.944 --> 00:06:33.355
It just kind of builds out into space.

164
00:06:35.075 --> 00:06:36.546
But you can't really measure it

165
00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:39.372
so it can't really be proven, okay?

166
00:06:39.372 --> 00:06:42.530
The way that the zero-point theory came about,

167
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.410
which is where this energy comes from,

168
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.546
is that they first took a vacuum,

169
00:06:48.546 --> 00:06:51.447
and they took all the gas out of it,

170
00:06:51.447 --> 00:06:53.356
thinking that they would get to

171
00:06:53.356 --> 00:06:55.425
kind of a bottom-level state.

172
00:06:55.425 --> 00:06:56.833
<v ->Kind of a process of elimination,</v>

173
00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.668
and what's left is scalar waves.

174
00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:00.737
<v ->Well, they still found that,</v>

175
00:07:00.737 --> 00:07:03.062
after they took the gas out, there was still activity.

176
00:07:03.062 --> 00:07:05.921
And then they decided to take all the thermal out,

177
00:07:05.921 --> 00:07:07.542
so they took it down to zero.

178
00:07:07.542 --> 00:07:09.440
You, know, to zero degrees.

179
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.696
And in doing so, everything should have,

180
00:07:13.696 --> 00:07:16.779
by law, just stopped, in the physical laws.

181
00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:18.016
I mean, at that point, nothing

182
00:07:18.016 --> 00:07:20.266
can have movement or exist.

183
00:07:20.266 --> 00:07:23.605
And the physical laws didn't hold up,

184
00:07:23.605 --> 00:07:26.573
because they still found some type of radiation activity.

185
00:07:26.573 --> 00:07:28.336
So at that point, they deduced

186
00:07:28.336 --> 00:07:30.330
that this is all coming in a sea

187
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.909
of this deep, unlimited potential

188
00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:37.314
that we call the zero-point field.

189
00:07:37.314 --> 00:07:39.909
Or, what's being named the zero-point field.

190
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:41.861
So, I hope that's somewhat clear.

191
00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:43.696
<v ->It's somewhat clear.</v>

192
00:07:43.696 --> 00:07:45.925
Let's go back to Tesla.

193
00:07:45.925 --> 00:07:48.730
How did Tesla demonstrate its existence?

194
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.492
What would some of those experiments have been?

195
00:07:51.492 --> 00:07:54.586
<v ->He was able to, and this is a little different,</v>

196
00:07:54.586 --> 00:07:56.441
this is going into the applications

197
00:07:56.441 --> 00:07:58.649
of scalar activity.

198
00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:02.180
But he was able to demonstrate an energy

199
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.889
that could be picked up invisibly

200
00:08:04.889 --> 00:08:06.841
as an energy source

201
00:08:06.841 --> 00:08:09.187
in his experiment, as I understand it.

202
00:08:09.187 --> 00:08:10.606
Now, I haven't read every aspect

203
00:08:10.606 --> 00:08:12.462
of how that experiment was conducted.

204
00:08:12.462 --> 00:08:15.992
I don't intened to try to presume.

205
00:08:15.992 --> 00:08:19.075
I don't even know how anybody actually--

206
00:08:19.075 --> 00:08:21.752
I guess he wrote a paper on how he did that.

207
00:08:21.752 --> 00:08:23.746
But one of the things he was doing,

208
00:08:23.746 --> 00:08:25.816
he was showing that energy could be conveyed

209
00:08:25.816 --> 00:08:27.735
from one point to another,

210
00:08:27.735 --> 00:08:31.245
and from this deep field, that would allow

211
00:08:31.245 --> 00:08:33.708
for what he intended to be some type

212
00:08:33.708 --> 00:08:36.556
of a perpetual energy that could be tapped into.

213
00:08:36.556 --> 00:08:38.924
And, that energy could be used to, say,

214
00:08:38.924 --> 00:08:40.417
run the appliances in your home,

215
00:08:40.417 --> 00:08:42.828
and electricity needs, or run your car,

216
00:08:42.828 --> 00:08:45.110
and be, basically, an energy-free system.

217
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.550
<v ->Well, that's the holy grail.</v>

218
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.332
I mean, that's what everybody's been looking for.

219
00:08:48.332 --> 00:08:50.102
This source's zero-point energy

220
00:08:50.102 --> 00:08:51.787
and how to harness it, right?

221
00:08:51.787 --> 00:08:53.462
<v ->And just to kinda be clear, here,</v>

222
00:08:53.462 --> 00:08:55.019
there's been a number of people

223
00:08:55.019 --> 00:08:58.528
that have already invented and found out

224
00:08:58.528 --> 00:09:01.355
how to utilize and create a perpetual-energy machine,

225
00:09:01.355 --> 00:09:03.541
including Tom Bearden,

226
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:06.837
who is the most highly recognized name right now,

227
00:09:06.837 --> 00:09:10.015
of a proponent of scalar technologies.

228
00:09:10.015 --> 00:09:13.311
And, so, these do exist.

229
00:09:13.311 --> 00:09:15.120
And for one purpose or another,

230
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.328
they have not been allowed to be brought into

231
00:09:17.328 --> 00:09:20.602
the production utilization for peoples here.

232
00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:22.832
There's interests that have conflicts with this,

233
00:09:22.832 --> 00:09:25.263
and there may be a timing in the universe

234
00:09:25.263 --> 00:09:27.429
where this isn't quite ready.

235
00:09:27.429 --> 00:09:29.722
<v ->Didn't he even put a schematic of the device</v>

236
00:09:29.722 --> 00:09:32.678
out on the internet so anybody could have access to it?

237
00:09:32.678 --> 00:09:34.093
<v ->I believe he did, and I believe</v>

238
00:09:34.093 --> 00:09:37.537
that many people have the technologies now.

239
00:09:37.537 --> 00:09:40.728
He has built one, I know, and demonstrated it.

240
00:09:42.638 --> 00:09:44.782
So, Tesla, his work kinda got buried

241
00:09:44.782 --> 00:09:47.342
after 50-60 years after he died,

242
00:09:47.342 --> 00:09:48.963
but then it's resurfaced again,

243
00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:51.310
and people have started to figure this all out again,

244
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.283
to the point where we are at now.

245
00:09:53.283 --> 00:09:54.861
So it's interesting.

246
00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:56.120
<v ->It's very interesting.</v>

247
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.691
Can we go back to the consciousness

248
00:09:58.691 --> 00:10:00.717
interface component of scalar waves,

249
00:10:00.717 --> 00:10:03.266
as best you can articulate it?

250
00:10:03.266 --> 00:10:08.266
<v ->Well, we've all heard that e=MC squared.</v>

251
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.456
That means energy equals the mass of an object,

252
00:10:14.456 --> 00:10:18.691
times the speed of light in centimeters squared.

253
00:10:19.661 --> 00:10:22.200
If you could figure out how many that is.

254
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.821
That's what Einstein decided, and everybody

255
00:10:23.821 --> 00:10:25.699
heralded it as, this is truth.

256
00:10:25.699 --> 00:10:27.672
And, so, as a great amount of energy

257
00:10:27.672 --> 00:10:29.144
gets liberated at a mass,

258
00:10:29.144 --> 00:10:31.970
this is something that you can actually see, okay?

259
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.194
With scalar wave technology,

260
00:10:35.194 --> 00:10:37.370
it comes out of time, basically.

261
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.602
Actually, the scalar waves circumvent,

262
00:10:40.602 --> 00:10:43.780
or go into hyperspace around the space component.

263
00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.031
It comes out of time.

264
00:10:46.031 --> 00:10:49.049
And it's a collapsing of time in some way

265
00:10:49.049 --> 00:10:51.214
that can extract energy, and the energy

266
00:10:51.214 --> 00:10:53.561
that can be extracted from the collapse of time

267
00:10:53.561 --> 00:10:56.270
is enormous, compared to the energy

268
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.097
that can be generated from mass.

269
00:11:00.153 --> 00:11:04.327
So, that's a very signifcant thing.

270
00:11:04.327 --> 00:11:06.492
The other things that I can share with you

271
00:11:06.492 --> 00:11:09.020
about scalar is that it's three to five times

272
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.113
stronger than an electromagnetic field.

273
00:11:13.903 --> 00:11:18.036
And it's designed to be able to hold up through,

274
00:11:19.516 --> 00:11:23.079
without any time or, being a factor of eroding it,

275
00:11:23.079 --> 00:11:25.361
or space and distance being a factor.

276
00:11:25.361 --> 00:11:27.004
So, basically, it doesn't decay.

277
00:11:27.004 --> 00:11:28.934
It continues intact.

278
00:11:28.934 --> 00:11:33.713
And it goes faster than the speed of light.

279
00:11:35.343 --> 00:11:36.962
Scalar Waves.
<v ->Okay.</v>

280
00:11:36.962 --> 00:11:38.380
<v ->So, in other words, the communication,</v>

281
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.799
in the way that we're using it

282
00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:42.305
with our businesses, it's instantaneous.

283
00:11:42.305 --> 00:11:43.905
It's an instantaneous communication

284
00:11:43.905 --> 00:11:47.809
of information that we laden onto the scalar wave.

285
00:11:47.809 --> 00:11:50.337
It's basically instantaneously communicated

286
00:11:50.337 --> 00:11:53.569
because there is no restriction in speed.

287
00:11:53.569 --> 00:11:55.382
<v ->Well, this would bring up</v>

288
00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.104
a thousand different questions.

289
00:11:57.104 --> 00:11:58.337
<v ->I'm sure.</v>

290
00:11:58.337 --> 00:12:01.007
<v ->I mean, we want to stay with,</v>

291
00:12:01.007 --> 00:12:03.089
I wouldn't mind using the consciousness

292
00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:04.502
in the way you're talking about,

293
00:12:04.502 --> 00:12:05.465
but what it's bringing to mind

294
00:12:05.465 --> 00:12:09.475
is incidences that have been considered miracles.

295
00:12:09.475 --> 00:12:11.896
I mean, the miraculous happens all the time, right?

296
00:12:11.896 --> 00:12:12.679
<v ->Mm hm.</v>

297
00:12:12.679 --> 00:12:14.710
<v ->And we see this often in</v>

298
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.056
spontaneous healings, for example, that happen.

299
00:12:17.056 --> 00:12:21.141
And sometimes, I know there's specific modalities

300
00:12:21.141 --> 00:12:22.954
where you collapse time and space

301
00:12:22.954 --> 00:12:24.832
in a healing process.

302
00:12:24.832 --> 00:12:26.218
<v ->Mm hm.</v>

303
00:12:26.218 --> 00:12:27.722
<v ->It seems that what we're talking about</v>

304
00:12:27.722 --> 00:12:29.258
in each of these instances

305
00:12:29.258 --> 00:12:32.362
is probably scalar wave activity.

306
00:12:32.362 --> 00:12:34.804
<v ->It's been, uh--
<v ->Combined with intention.</v>

307
00:12:34.804 --> 00:12:37.919
<v ->It's been pretty much confirmed</v>

308
00:12:37.919 --> 00:12:40.959
that when you have a true healing energy

309
00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:43.241
that's taking place out of a human being,

310
00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:45.929
that there are things that happen,

311
00:12:45.929 --> 00:12:47.742
that the closest representation

312
00:12:47.742 --> 00:12:49.790
that you can actually attribute to these,

313
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:54.174
what we call miracle events of healing,

314
00:12:54.174 --> 00:12:56.542
are coming out of the scalar field.

315
00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:58.419
And that's what people have started

316
00:12:58.419 --> 00:12:59.997
to come to an assumption on.

317
00:12:59.997 --> 00:13:01.533
<v ->So, it's a field of pure potential.</v>

318
00:13:01.533 --> 00:13:02.739
<v ->It is.</v>

319
00:13:02.739 --> 00:13:04.200
<v ->That comes out of time.</v>

320
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.461
<v Thom>Beyond time--</v>
<v ->Beyond time.</v>

321
00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:08.253
That moves beyond time,

322
00:13:08.253 --> 00:13:09.554
which, time is very negotiable,

323
00:13:09.554 --> 00:13:11.894
as we know now, and it is,

324
00:13:15.344 --> 00:13:19.772
the effect is in direct response to the intention.

325
00:13:20.832 --> 00:13:22.655
<v ->Yes, that's correct.</v>

326
00:13:22.655 --> 00:13:24.533
I mean, how you intend--
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

327
00:13:24.533 --> 00:13:26.608
<v ->What your intention is can get magnified</v>

328
00:13:26.608 --> 00:13:29.861
using scalar activity.
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

329
00:13:29.861 --> 00:13:31.030
<v ->And that's one of the things,</v>

330
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.166
we have five foundations to our business, really.

331
00:13:34.166 --> 00:13:36.224
And one of them is intention.

332
00:13:36.224 --> 00:13:37.622
<v ->Yes, very much so.</v>

333
00:13:37.622 --> 00:13:40.939
<v ->So, we're looking at everything possible to enhance,</v>

334
00:13:40.939 --> 00:13:42.240
and one of the things that the

335
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.237
scalar wave has afforded us the opportunity of,

336
00:13:45.237 --> 00:13:48.602
thanks to Dr. Feinberg's

337
00:13:49.672 --> 00:13:53.014
input into bringing this into our utilization,

338
00:13:53.014 --> 00:13:58.014
is the technology itself can be reproduced,

339
00:13:58.048 --> 00:14:01.600
and it can be repeated over and over and over,

340
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.387
to drive in deeper the intention.

341
00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:07.893
So, the way that we're using it

342
00:14:07.893 --> 00:14:11.264
is on a repetitive basis, the scalar wave technology,

343
00:14:11.264 --> 00:14:12.746
so that we're using it as

344
00:14:12.746 --> 00:14:14.581
a method of reinforcement.

345
00:14:14.581 --> 00:14:16.319
<v ->And so, the component that is</v>

346
00:14:16.319 --> 00:14:21.268
invariably being used is this time aspect

347
00:14:21.268 --> 00:14:22.708
of the time space continuum?

348
00:14:22.708 --> 00:14:25.097
<v ->I feel, from all I've read, and understand,</v>

349
00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:27.465
that the time component seems to be

350
00:14:27.465 --> 00:14:28.681
where it's being drawn from.

351
00:14:28.681 --> 00:14:30.587
And you can't see time, so--
<v Regina>Right.</v>

352
00:14:30.587 --> 00:14:32.602
<v ->there's nothing visible to the senses</v>

353
00:14:32.602 --> 00:14:34.256
that can compute this.

354
00:14:34.256 --> 00:14:35.301
<v ->And it's not linear.</v>

355
00:14:35.301 --> 00:14:36.463
<v ->And it's not linear.</v>

356
00:14:36.463 --> 00:14:38.853
<v ->It's simply its own force, or dimension.</v>

357
00:14:38.853 --> 00:14:41.476
<v ->It comes out of its own universe,</v>

358
00:14:41.476 --> 00:14:43.940
and they talk about the scalar--

359
00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.466
by the way, there's different names

360
00:14:45.466 --> 00:14:46.564
for scalar waves.

361
00:14:46.564 --> 00:14:48.281
They call it non-Hertzian wave.

362
00:14:48.281 --> 00:14:49.945
In other words, we measure everything in Hertz

363
00:14:49.945 --> 00:14:51.620
on the electromagnetic spectrum.

364
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.101
They call it quantum fields.

365
00:14:54.101 --> 00:14:55.541
<v Regina>Yes, quantum fields,</v>

366
00:14:55.541 --> 00:14:56.767
of which, I think most people are

367
00:14:56.767 --> 00:14:58.170
more familar with that term.
<v Thom>And Tesla waves,</v>

368
00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.696
they refer to it as Tesla waves.

369
00:14:59.696 --> 00:15:02.021
And longitudinal waves.

370
00:15:02.021 --> 00:15:03.279
<v ->Longitudinal waves.</v>

371
00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:04.527
<v ->And I've even read at points</v>

372
00:15:04.527 --> 00:15:06.020
where they're tachyon energy.

373
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.620
<v ->Is tachyon, is that?</v>

374
00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.644
<v ->Well, I hate to bring it up.</v>

375
00:15:08.644 --> 00:15:12.815
It's been used as a synonym to a scalar wave,

376
00:15:12.815 --> 00:15:15.556
and I'm not really sure, exactly,

377
00:15:15.556 --> 00:15:16.953
if that's true or not.

378
00:15:16.953 --> 00:15:20.718
But it's possibly another synonym.

379
00:15:20.718 --> 00:15:23.161
<v Regina>But, essentially, this is the quantum field</v>

380
00:15:23.161 --> 00:15:24.522
that everybody's talking about.

381
00:15:24.522 --> 00:15:25.087
<v ->Exactly.</v>

382
00:15:25.087 --> 00:15:27.892
<v ->That almost all fields of science</v>

383
00:15:27.892 --> 00:15:30.687
are converging upon this quantum field

384
00:15:30.687 --> 00:15:32.564
for understanding of the interface

385
00:15:32.564 --> 00:15:34.196
of intention and consciousness

386
00:15:34.196 --> 00:15:35.775
with the manifestation of something

387
00:15:35.775 --> 00:15:37.300
into the physical reality.

388
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.656
<v ->When we talk about</v>

389
00:15:38.656 --> 00:15:41.316
the manifestation of this field,

390
00:15:41.316 --> 00:15:44.132
we're talking about the optimal potential

391
00:15:44.132 --> 00:15:46.777
that exists for a human or an organization

392
00:15:46.777 --> 00:15:49.774
to be able to draw upon this

393
00:15:49.774 --> 00:15:53.251
for their source of productivity and their flow.

394
00:15:53.251 --> 00:15:56.269
So you're taking potential flows

395
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:59.224
and turning them into, actually, reality flows.

396
00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:01.378
Another name for the field, by the way,

397
00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:03.629
is neutrino fields.
<v Regina>Neutrino, right.</v>

398
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:04.632
<v ->Now, let's talk about that</v>

399
00:16:04.632 --> 00:16:05.583
for just a moment.
<v Regina>All right.</v>

400
00:16:05.583 --> 00:16:07.725
<v ->Neutrinos are subatomic particles.</v>

401
00:16:07.725 --> 00:16:09.538
And they travel at faster

402
00:16:09.538 --> 00:16:11.277
than the speed of light.

403
00:16:11.277 --> 00:16:13.837
When they start to slow down

404
00:16:13.837 --> 00:16:15.693
to the speed of light,

405
00:16:15.693 --> 00:16:17.058
they're now called "photons."

406
00:16:17.058 --> 00:16:18.711
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

407
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:20.460
<v ->And when the photons slow down</v>

408
00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.665
to below the speed of light,

409
00:16:21.665 --> 00:16:23.564
they're now called "electrons."

410
00:16:23.564 --> 00:16:26.497
<v Regina>So it's just a step-down process.</v>

411
00:16:26.497 --> 00:16:28.480
<v ->It is a step-down process.
<v Regina>of the scalar wave.</v>

412
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.130
<v ->A manifestation, okay?</v>

413
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.309
<v ->A manifestation, that's really key.</v>

414
00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:35.975
<v ->And, I really want to make this point here,</v>

415
00:16:35.975 --> 00:16:39.346
because this whole process,

416
00:16:39.346 --> 00:16:41.436
as energy gets stepped down,

417
00:16:41.436 --> 00:16:43.527
it means it actually can be utilized

418
00:16:43.527 --> 00:16:44.796
in the form of fields.

419
00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:46.428
I talked about fields the last time,

420
00:16:46.428 --> 00:16:48.182
in our last interview.
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

421
00:16:48.182 --> 00:16:50.144
<v ->And, basically, what I said there,</v>

422
00:16:50.144 --> 00:16:52.405
to recap real quickly, was that

423
00:16:52.405 --> 00:16:55.443
the entire space that exists

424
00:16:57.763 --> 00:16:59.472
is mostly just space.

425
00:16:59.472 --> 00:17:01.211
It would appear to the eye.

426
00:17:01.211 --> 00:17:02.373
Because, when you didact down

427
00:17:02.373 --> 00:17:04.464
electron and neutron, it's all space.

428
00:17:04.464 --> 00:17:06.924
It's mostly space, there's almost no matter.

429
00:17:06.924 --> 00:17:09.089
And now they've taken down these particles

430
00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:11.457
into subatomic particles that make them up,

431
00:17:11.457 --> 00:17:12.918
and they're mostly space.

432
00:17:12.918 --> 00:17:14.049
And it gets down to the point

433
00:17:14.049 --> 00:17:16.470
where they're really, in truth,

434
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.048
even though we can't see it as easily

435
00:17:18.048 --> 00:17:19.371
through our physical senses,

436
00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:21.461
but in truth, there really is no matter.

437
00:17:21.461 --> 00:17:22.848
There's no materialism.

438
00:17:22.848 --> 00:17:24.928
Materialism died a long time ago.

439
00:17:24.928 --> 00:17:26.851
It's been proved by physics.

440
00:17:26.851 --> 00:17:27.561
<v Regina>Right.</v>

441
00:17:27.561 --> 00:17:29.083
<v ->And so, with the understanding</v>

442
00:17:29.083 --> 00:17:32.198
that there really is no form,

443
00:17:32.198 --> 00:17:33.872
and that the form that we all see

444
00:17:33.872 --> 00:17:37.307
is a perceptual illusion, or perception only,

445
00:17:37.307 --> 00:17:41.114
this makes it possible and pliable

446
00:17:41.114 --> 00:17:42.757
to make changes into life.

447
00:17:42.757 --> 00:17:44.111
Beneficial changes.

448
00:17:44.111 --> 00:17:47.525
And so, what we're working with is fields.

449
00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:49.444
We're working with fields.

450
00:17:49.444 --> 00:17:50.863
And this is the energy

451
00:17:50.863 --> 00:17:51.962
that's getting stepped down

452
00:17:51.962 --> 00:17:53.882
that we call upon to intention,

453
00:17:53.882 --> 00:17:55.855
through focus and our connection

454
00:17:55.855 --> 00:17:57.785
that we can call upon to bring down

455
00:17:57.785 --> 00:18:01.945
from the neutrino to the quantum phase of photon,

456
00:18:01.945 --> 00:18:03.940
and then down into the electron.

457
00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.763
And the manifestation of those electrons

458
00:18:06.763 --> 00:18:10.340
into orbits that would allow for changes

459
00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.601
in the, what we call human density,

460
00:18:12.601 --> 00:18:14.915
or human life here.

461
00:18:14.915 --> 00:18:17.699
<v ->So, what drives the stepping-down process</v>

462
00:18:17.699 --> 00:18:21.955
from the subatomic particle phase, right?

463
00:18:21.955 --> 00:18:24.696
From the neutrino, down into the electron,

464
00:18:24.696 --> 00:18:26.275
down into physical matter.

465
00:18:26.275 --> 00:18:27.619
Is that our intention?

466
00:18:27.619 --> 00:18:28.429
<v ->It is.</v>

467
00:18:28.429 --> 00:18:30.541
And, it's not the scalar wave so much

468
00:18:30.541 --> 00:18:31.864
as it is our intention.

469
00:18:31.864 --> 00:18:33.240
We are the power.

470
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.968
The power is within us.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

471
00:18:34.968 --> 00:18:37.013
<v ->I mean, everybody's heard this little expression,</v>

472
00:18:37.013 --> 00:18:38.634
you can light up New York City, maybe,

473
00:18:38.634 --> 00:18:41.866
with the cells of the thumb of your finger,

474
00:18:41.866 --> 00:18:43.907
and you could do this for maybe a week.

475
00:18:43.907 --> 00:18:45.909
There's so much energy that could

476
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:47.349
be liberated, possibly.

477
00:18:47.349 --> 00:18:49.503
Well, out of the scalar field,

478
00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:51.412
there's so much energy that could be liberated

479
00:18:51.412 --> 00:18:53.247
as well, and more so.

480
00:18:53.247 --> 00:18:56.148
So, you know, the unlimited supply of energy exists,

481
00:18:56.148 --> 00:18:58.420
and it's basically, in our case,

482
00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.329
in our company, it's the facilitator,

483
00:19:00.329 --> 00:19:02.345
and the consciousness that they hold,

484
00:19:02.345 --> 00:19:04.361
and how they see things.

485
00:19:04.361 --> 00:19:07.880
And the consciousness technology that we utilize

486
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.380
in our work,

487
00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:13.227
that brings forth these possibilities to take place.

488
00:19:13.227 --> 00:19:15.083
And the fact that we're seeing these

489
00:19:15.083 --> 00:19:17.238
gives us, basically, a template

490
00:19:17.238 --> 00:19:19.286
that we can operate off of.

491
00:19:19.286 --> 00:19:21.178
And this template is called--

492
00:19:21.838 --> 00:19:24.471
well, it's been given different names, but,

493
00:19:27.081 --> 00:19:30.369
it's like a principle of formative causation,

494
00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:32.854
where you can actually get into, and see,

495
00:19:32.854 --> 00:19:37.392
and feel, and understand the manifestation of life

496
00:19:37.392 --> 00:19:39.046
through our own eyes.

497
00:19:39.046 --> 00:19:40.646
I mean, we can actually get so close

498
00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:44.155
to the nature of this process

499
00:19:44.155 --> 00:19:46.821
through the principles of formative causation,

500
00:19:46.821 --> 00:19:49.025
which we are able to demonstrate to ourselves

501
00:19:49.025 --> 00:19:50.582
with the work that we do.

502
00:19:50.582 --> 00:19:53.334
And this is how we are able to impact,

503
00:19:53.334 --> 00:19:55.233
you know, a transformation of a business,

504
00:19:55.233 --> 00:19:59.147
or an individual health, if that may be the application.

505
00:19:59.147 --> 00:20:04.147
<v Regina>Right. So, this really is the holy grail</v>

506
00:20:04.949 --> 00:20:08.960
when it comes to, as many of the more

507
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.330
"pop" books and such,

508
00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:13.770
that have come out recently,

509
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.157
having to do with manifestation,

510
00:20:15.157 --> 00:20:17.365
how to get what you want in life, and so forth,

511
00:20:17.365 --> 00:20:21.247
which are really kind of basic in their nature.

512
00:20:21.247 --> 00:20:24.308
The reality is, the potential of

513
00:20:24.308 --> 00:20:26.281
what we are able to bring into life,

514
00:20:26.281 --> 00:20:29.023
bring into our world, is virtually unlimited,

515
00:20:29.023 --> 00:20:31.230
if our perceptions were unlimited.

516
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.340
Is that correct?

517
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.292
Essentially, if we took the blinders off

518
00:20:34.292 --> 00:20:36.563
and understood what we were capable of,

519
00:20:36.563 --> 00:20:38.238
what the field was capable of,

520
00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:41.022
we'd be almost unstoppable

521
00:20:41.022 --> 00:20:42.771
in our ability to manifest?

522
00:20:42.771 --> 00:20:44.926
<v ->Well, it feels like that's what we're doing,</v>

523
00:20:44.926 --> 00:20:45.832
more and more.

524
00:20:45.832 --> 00:20:47.197
I mean, we're put here on the earth

525
00:20:47.197 --> 00:20:49.149
to learn lessons and to go through experiences,

526
00:20:49.149 --> 00:20:50.845
and to have a deeper appreciation

527
00:20:50.845 --> 00:20:52.520
of ourself as a being.

528
00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.677
And we also are here to demonstrate

529
00:20:55.677 --> 00:20:58.791
that we are part of the formative nature of the universe.

530
00:20:58.791 --> 00:21:01.159
And one of the ways that we can

531
00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:02.407
experience that within our self

532
00:21:02.407 --> 00:21:04.914
is through our ability to manifest,

533
00:21:04.914 --> 00:21:07.036
or to bring forth results.

534
00:21:07.036 --> 00:21:08.679
In a company, it's its goals.

535
00:21:08.679 --> 00:21:11.047
In an individual it may be self-realization.

536
00:21:11.047 --> 00:21:14.790
Whatever a person has chosen for their life,

537
00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:18.758
we do have the ability to bring forth these things,

538
00:21:18.758 --> 00:21:19.985
and I believe that the more

539
00:21:19.985 --> 00:21:22.406
that we can demonstrate this idea

540
00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:26.176
that we can bring forth what it is that we require

541
00:21:26.176 --> 00:21:29.344
for our well-being, and our health,

542
00:21:29.344 --> 00:21:31.093
and our life and business,

543
00:21:31.093 --> 00:21:32.928
and how that can be used to benefit others.

544
00:21:32.928 --> 00:21:35.488
I think that's part of our lessons

545
00:21:35.488 --> 00:21:36.928
and our enfoldment.

546
00:21:36.928 --> 00:21:38.528
<v Regina>And, so, it really comes down to</v>

547
00:21:38.528 --> 00:21:40.469
establishing new belief systems, in a way,

548
00:21:40.469 --> 00:21:42.623
in terms of our potential as human beings.

549
00:21:42.623 --> 00:21:45.151
<v ->And those belief systems change</v>

550
00:21:45.151 --> 00:21:47.434
as the human processing errors

551
00:21:47.434 --> 00:21:49.354
underlying those beliefs change.

552
00:21:49.354 --> 00:21:50.729
And, pretty much, that's what we--

553
00:21:50.729 --> 00:21:52.009
<v Regina>Human processing errors, I love it. (laughs)</v>

554
00:21:52.009 --> 00:21:53.201
<v ->Yeah, human processing errors.</v>

555
00:21:53.201 --> 00:21:55.803
Or the information fault structures--

556
00:21:55.803 --> 00:21:58.116
<v Regina>Or programs, or belief systems, or whatever.</v>

557
00:21:58.116 --> 00:21:59.972
<v ->And we call them informational fault structures</v>

558
00:21:59.972 --> 00:22:01.945
underlying illusionary constructs.

559
00:22:01.945 --> 00:22:03.107
<v Regina>Illusionary constructs.</v>

560
00:22:03.107 --> 00:22:04.909
<v ->That would give rise to such.</v>

561
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:05.856
You know, one of the things

562
00:22:05.856 --> 00:22:07.296
that happen in a business,

563
00:22:07.296 --> 00:22:10.229
is that it gets attuned,

564
00:22:10.229 --> 00:22:12.544
or an individual gets attuned to things,

565
00:22:12.544 --> 00:22:15.893
but they may not be for their highest good.

566
00:22:15.893 --> 00:22:18.047
I mean, you may be attuned to alcohol,

567
00:22:18.047 --> 00:22:19.818
and you think it's great,

568
00:22:19.818 --> 00:22:21.877
but that attunement may not be your

569
00:22:21.877 --> 00:22:23.157
best possible attunement.

570
00:22:23.157 --> 00:22:23.967
<v Regina>Right.</v>

571
00:22:23.967 --> 00:22:25.850
<v ->And there's many different things</v>

572
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:27.194
that we could become attuned to,

573
00:22:27.194 --> 00:22:29.125
so the idea is, what's keeping us attuned

574
00:22:29.125 --> 00:22:31.748
to the things that really aren't serving us anymore?

575
00:22:31.748 --> 00:22:33.018
And, usually, it's the underlying

576
00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:34.788
informational fault structure,

577
00:22:34.788 --> 00:22:37.572
which is what we focus on pretty significantly

578
00:22:37.572 --> 00:22:39.428
with working with a company.

579
00:22:39.428 --> 00:22:40.494
<v Regina>So, let's talk about,</v>

580
00:22:40.494 --> 00:22:44.491
now we're understanding that this is a,

581
00:22:44.491 --> 00:22:47.232
almost a magnifier, or a booster,

582
00:22:47.232 --> 00:22:49.952
for our consciousness, in terms of

583
00:22:49.952 --> 00:22:52.181
whatever we're choosing to create in our lives.

584
00:22:52.181 --> 00:22:54.687
And so, in this case, we're talking about businesses.

585
00:22:54.687 --> 00:22:57.119
We already interviewed Dr. Leslie Feinberg,

586
00:22:57.119 --> 00:22:59.679
who talked about how this same technology

587
00:22:59.679 --> 00:23:04.372
can be used to heal some rather critical conditions

588
00:23:04.372 --> 00:23:06.900
in pretty much anything in the human body.

589
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.820
It doesn't seem to have any limitations.

590
00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:09.588
<v ->Right.</v>

591
00:23:09.588 --> 00:23:12.030
<v ->But, you're saying, as we said in the last interview,</v>

592
00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.540
this can go to any entity,

593
00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.819
meaning where there's consciousness

594
00:23:14.819 --> 00:23:16.121
that's been put into place,

595
00:23:16.121 --> 00:23:17.390
such as a business.

596
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:21.155
The same principles can go to healing business, right?

597
00:23:21.155 --> 00:23:22.296
<v ->Mm hm. And instead of working</v>

598
00:23:22.296 --> 00:23:24.408
on biological systems, and looking at that

599
00:23:24.408 --> 00:23:28.050
as the main focus, we look at other aspects.

600
00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.625
Organizational systems, we look at

601
00:23:29.625 --> 00:23:32.409
what we call morphic fields, that have come

602
00:23:32.409 --> 00:23:34.062
from Rupert Sheldrake's work,

603
00:23:34.062 --> 00:23:36.355
and our belief is that, if you can

604
00:23:36.355 --> 00:23:38.286
take the goals of a company,

605
00:23:38.286 --> 00:23:40.376
the mission of a company, its vision,

606
00:23:40.376 --> 00:23:43.277
the qualities of other companies it most admires,

607
00:23:43.277 --> 00:23:44.739
its foundational principles,

608
00:23:44.739 --> 00:23:47.384
and also to shift any concerns into goals.

609
00:23:47.384 --> 00:23:50.456
And we can get these at 100% alignment

610
00:23:50.456 --> 00:23:53.495
and attunement to a business,

611
00:23:53.495 --> 00:23:56.066
and bringing all these, what we call

612
00:23:56.066 --> 00:23:58.508
morphic fields, or foundational principles,

613
00:23:58.508 --> 00:24:00.599
into 100% attunement, that business

614
00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:04.780
has a far, far greater success potential.

615
00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.641
<v Regina>It really forces the players,</v>

616
00:24:06.641 --> 00:24:09.948
the principles in a business, to have to

617
00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:12.235
look at their genuine intention,

618
00:24:12.235 --> 00:24:13.771
and their genuine belief systems.

619
00:24:13.771 --> 00:24:15.531
I mean, this really forces the issue, doesn't it?

620
00:24:15.531 --> 00:24:16.555
<v ->Very much so.</v>

621
00:24:16.555 --> 00:24:20.672
You know, I hope I didn't say this

622
00:24:20.672 --> 00:24:21.920
in the last interview, because

623
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.107
I wouldn't want to repeat anything, necessarily,

624
00:24:24.107 --> 00:24:26.613
but this idea of a sports player.

625
00:24:26.613 --> 00:24:28.608
When they can actually achieve

626
00:24:28.608 --> 00:24:31.743
another 2% onto their stats,

627
00:24:31.743 --> 00:24:35.317
whether it be free throws, or field shots,

628
00:24:35.317 --> 00:24:38.132
or rebounds, or whatever, assists.

629
00:24:38.132 --> 00:24:40.244
When they can get a little increase

630
00:24:40.244 --> 00:24:43.263
in their actual high performance already,

631
00:24:43.263 --> 00:24:44.649
it's not a little.

632
00:24:44.649 --> 00:24:46.857
It's like running from the 4-minute mile

633
00:24:46.857 --> 00:24:49.012
down to the 3.98-minute mile.

634
00:24:49.012 --> 00:24:50.430
It's, like, a major thing.

635
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:51.710
But once that happens,

636
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:54.707
it's enough to carry a team into many more victories

637
00:24:54.707 --> 00:24:56.937
that maybe it wouldn't have experienced.

638
00:24:56.937 --> 00:24:58.931
And, same with a business.

639
00:24:58.931 --> 00:25:00.371
If you can get it into its highest

640
00:25:00.371 --> 00:25:02.366
optimal potential alignment,

641
00:25:02.366 --> 00:25:03.709
we're talking about alignment.

642
00:25:03.709 --> 00:25:05.619
Alignment within all the individuals

643
00:25:05.619 --> 00:25:07.869
within that entity of the business.

644
00:25:07.869 --> 00:25:09.661
And we can get the business entity itself

645
00:25:09.661 --> 00:25:13.298
into its own alignment, and its growth,

646
00:25:13.298 --> 00:25:15.186
then, basically, you have a much greater chance

647
00:25:15.186 --> 00:25:17.906
to put wind into the sails, so to speak,

648
00:25:17.906 --> 00:25:20.018
of your vehicle.

649
00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:21.906
<v Regina>Makes total sense.</v>

650
00:25:21.906 --> 00:25:22.994
But first, they have to get past,

651
00:25:22.994 --> 00:25:24.871
as you were talking about earlier,

652
00:25:24.871 --> 00:25:27.196
there are erroneous attunements.

653
00:25:27.196 --> 00:25:27.943
<v ->There are.</v>

654
00:25:27.943 --> 00:25:30.841
<v ->And let's talk about what happens in businesses</v>

655
00:25:30.841 --> 00:25:33.974
along the line of erroneous attunements.

656
00:25:33.974 --> 00:25:36.812
<v ->Well, there's tens of thousands,</v>

657
00:25:36.812 --> 00:25:39.713
hundreds of thousands, and businesses--

658
00:25:39.713 --> 00:25:40.353
<v Regina>What does that mean?</v>

659
00:25:40.353 --> 00:25:41.676
What does an erroneous attunement

660
00:25:41.676 --> 00:25:43.350
in business actually mean?

661
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:45.110
<v ->Erroneous would be something</v>

662
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.571
that's not serving itself towards

663
00:25:46.571 --> 00:25:48.384
its objectives of growth,

664
00:25:48.384 --> 00:25:50.336
or its goals to be met, or its mission

665
00:25:50.336 --> 00:25:51.520
to be realized.

666
00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.355
And so, it could be, let's say,

667
00:25:53.355 --> 00:25:56.555
I don't want to pick on any corporations right now,

668
00:25:56.555 --> 00:25:58.187
that wouldn't be, probably, wise,

669
00:25:58.187 --> 00:26:00.138
but there's a large company that went through

670
00:26:00.138 --> 00:26:03.733
a recent experience with the FDC, for instance.

671
00:26:03.733 --> 00:26:06.847
And they had a couple incidences

672
00:26:06.847 --> 00:26:08.490
that they had to go through,

673
00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:11.306
at great expense to their company,

674
00:26:11.306 --> 00:26:14.644
and that, in a sense, could have become

675
00:26:14.644 --> 00:26:17.033
a trauma to them, in terms of

676
00:26:17.033 --> 00:26:20.052
future choices, and future awarenesses

677
00:26:20.052 --> 00:26:21.076
that they would have.

678
00:26:21.076 --> 00:26:22.814
Now, with good discrimination,

679
00:26:22.814 --> 00:26:25.044
a lot of times, they might not choose

680
00:26:25.044 --> 00:26:26.878
to go down a road that they did before,

681
00:26:26.878 --> 00:26:28.158
based on that experience.

682
00:26:28.158 --> 00:26:29.534
But that experience also could be

683
00:26:29.534 --> 00:26:33.310
an erroneous processing situation

684
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.379
in the company, an erroneous, what did we say,

685
00:26:35.379 --> 00:26:37.256
an erroneous attunement to the company

686
00:26:37.256 --> 00:26:38.931
in the sense that they would be attuned

687
00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:41.928
to either the failure or the difficulty

688
00:26:41.928 --> 00:26:44.253
that that brought to the company,

689
00:26:44.253 --> 00:26:46.877
both financially or emotionally.

690
00:26:46.877 --> 00:26:49.821
And that could be weighing upon the company.

691
00:26:49.821 --> 00:26:53.376
And that's just one tiny, tiny little example of--

692
00:26:53.376 --> 00:26:56.408
<v Regina>What would something rather mundane be,</v>

693
00:26:56.408 --> 00:26:59.327
in a Mom and Pop, say, grocery store,

694
00:26:59.327 --> 00:27:01.130
that might be failing?

695
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.871
Or maybe isn't thriving as much as it could be?

696
00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:06.474
What would be some recognizable

697
00:27:06.474 --> 00:27:09.428
everyday erroneous attunements?

698
00:27:09.428 --> 00:27:10.772
<v ->Well, I don't know if they're recognizable,</v>

699
00:27:10.772 --> 00:27:12.841
because illusions are kind of illusions,

700
00:27:12.841 --> 00:27:15.348
in the sense of, it might be a belief system that they have.

701
00:27:15.348 --> 00:27:16.990
You can go back to beliefs with this.

702
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:18.804
It might be a belief that they have,

703
00:27:18.804 --> 00:27:20.382
like, it's not good to make money,

704
00:27:20.382 --> 00:27:21.758
because their grandparents told them that,

705
00:27:21.758 --> 00:27:22.654
or something.

706
00:27:22.654 --> 00:27:24.521
Or that you're never going to amount to anything.

707
00:27:24.521 --> 00:27:26.696
That's a belief that, that could be

708
00:27:26.696 --> 00:27:29.555
being played out, and the store not doing as well.

709
00:27:29.555 --> 00:27:30.808
<v Regina>And that's deeply subconscious,</v>

710
00:27:30.808 --> 00:27:32.638
for the most part.
<v Thom>Deeply.</v>

711
00:27:32.638 --> 00:27:34.025
Well, subconscious, right.

712
00:27:34.025 --> 00:27:36.336
In the sense that they're not aware of it.

713
00:27:36.336 --> 00:27:37.795
Not to mean that the subconscious isn't aware.

714
00:27:37.795 --> 00:27:40.137
<v Regina>Right, right. It's hyper-aware.</v>

715
00:27:40.137 --> 00:27:41.929
<v Thom>Right, yeah.</v>

716
00:27:41.929 --> 00:27:43.508
But another example might be,

717
00:27:43.508 --> 00:27:45.481
and this is a little bit more abstractual,

718
00:27:45.481 --> 00:27:48.051
but, people have heard of bandwidth in technology?

719
00:27:48.051 --> 00:27:48.430
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

720
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.777
<v ->And the amount of through-put of energy</v>

721
00:27:50.777 --> 00:27:52.697
that go through lines and stuff,

722
00:27:52.697 --> 00:27:54.958
for the use of data equipment, and all.

723
00:27:54.958 --> 00:27:57.880
And there's also a bandwidth for finance,

724
00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.248
and financial streams and flows

725
00:28:00.248 --> 00:28:01.880
through an organization.

726
00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.290
For instance, if we had checked their company,

727
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:05.656
it might be that they have a bandwidth

728
00:28:05.656 --> 00:28:09.858
in the very, very low range of what's possible.

729
00:28:09.858 --> 00:28:11.821
And our idea is to get the bandwidth

730
00:28:11.821 --> 00:28:13.120
in a very high range,

731
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.245
and we do that by clearing the informational faults

732
00:28:16.245 --> 00:28:19.615
of which they're erroneously attuned to.

733
00:28:19.615 --> 00:28:22.260
<v Regina>Mm hm. So, those faults are actually</v>

734
00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:25.769
blocking the flow of the vital life force, or energy,

735
00:28:25.769 --> 00:28:27.625
to the mission of that company.

736
00:28:27.625 --> 00:28:28.532
<v ->Very much so.</v>

737
00:28:28.532 --> 00:28:30.164
Very much so.

738
00:28:30.164 --> 00:28:31.785
That's the core of it, really.

739
00:28:31.785 --> 00:28:34.985
I mean, once you can clear and re-unify

740
00:28:34.985 --> 00:28:38.355
with the source of creation, you know,

741
00:28:38.355 --> 00:28:39.934
and let go of a lot of this stuff,

742
00:28:39.934 --> 00:28:42.046
and that's our function as a company.

743
00:28:42.046 --> 00:28:44.328
We're really an unparalleled company,

744
00:28:44.328 --> 00:28:46.664
in the sense that nobody's quite done

745
00:28:46.664 --> 00:28:49.149
what we are able to do to accelerate a momentum.

746
00:28:49.149 --> 00:28:52.562
And, what we do, what we bring into a company,

747
00:28:52.562 --> 00:28:56.253
we can do a lot in terms of changing

748
00:28:56.253 --> 00:28:58.301
the underlying constructs that are

749
00:28:58.301 --> 00:28:59.858
compromising a company from having

750
00:28:59.858 --> 00:29:01.970
more optimal flow and more optimal outcome.

751
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.039
<v Regina>You also talk about duality.</v>

752
00:29:04.039 --> 00:29:05.906
Where does that fit in?

753
00:29:05.906 --> 00:29:07.623
<v ->Well, again, that goes back to the idea</v>

754
00:29:07.623 --> 00:29:09.468
of that foam idea.

755
00:29:09.468 --> 00:29:11.623
Duality is, of course, it's kind of a,

756
00:29:11.623 --> 00:29:14.918
we think, it seems like a great reality in this world,

757
00:29:14.918 --> 00:29:16.006
because everything we experience

758
00:29:16.006 --> 00:29:18.193
has those components in it.

759
00:29:19.743 --> 00:29:23.415
But, really, as a facilitator in this work,

760
00:29:23.415 --> 00:29:26.348
our job is to look at life

761
00:29:26.348 --> 00:29:29.431
through this undifferentiated stream,

762
00:29:29.431 --> 00:29:31.756
basically, a potential in possibility.

763
00:29:31.756 --> 00:29:35.126
And, if you look, in the scalar wave,

764
00:29:35.126 --> 00:29:36.609
they call it a standing wave.

765
00:29:36.609 --> 00:29:38.955
And they caught that it has, basically,

766
00:29:38.955 --> 00:29:41.654
it's still.

767
00:29:41.654 --> 00:29:43.392
It's a still point.

768
00:29:43.392 --> 00:29:46.016
And they see no movement.

769
00:29:46.016 --> 00:29:47.659
And they talk about these things.

770
00:29:47.659 --> 00:29:49.472
But that, actually, is part of duality,

771
00:29:49.472 --> 00:29:53.653
and if you go deeper into the quantum fields,

772
00:29:53.653 --> 00:29:56.330
you'll see that, behind that stillpoint,

773
00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:59.370
are teeming life, greater than anything

774
00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:02.687
that you could imagine in electromagnetic field spectrum.

775
00:30:02.687 --> 00:30:04.223
Just teeming with life,

776
00:30:04.223 --> 00:30:05.844
and it just so happens that there are

777
00:30:05.844 --> 00:30:08.468
certain vectors and things that silence,

778
00:30:08.468 --> 00:30:09.748
when the scalar wave comes out,

779
00:30:09.748 --> 00:30:13.396
it silences that, to make it look like it's motionless.

780
00:30:13.396 --> 00:30:15.785
But when you go down and probe in deeper,

781
00:30:15.785 --> 00:30:19.934
it's just teeming with life, that's all I can say.

782
00:30:19.934 --> 00:30:22.473
It's so much life and so much energy.

783
00:30:22.473 --> 00:30:24.093
<v Regina>Is this what's also been referred to</v>

784
00:30:24.093 --> 00:30:25.458
as, "the plenum"?

785
00:30:25.458 --> 00:30:27.549
Or that term, "plenum"?

786
00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:28.808
<v ->Give me your definition.</v>

787
00:30:28.808 --> 00:30:30.333
I've heard of that word a number of times.

788
00:30:30.333 --> 00:30:34.194
<v ->It seems, well, that's just a free association in my mind.</v>

789
00:30:34.194 --> 00:30:36.188
It seems we're talking about the same thing here.

790
00:30:36.188 --> 00:30:37.298
<v ->Most likely.</v>

791
00:30:37.298 --> 00:30:41.702
<v Regina>That, quote, "vacuum" that's teeming with life.</v>

792
00:30:41.702 --> 00:30:42.292
<v ->Mm hm.</v>

793
00:30:42.292 --> 00:30:44.761
<v ->So, okay, now let's--
<v Thom>By the way,</v>

794
00:30:44.761 --> 00:30:45.731
I just wanted to point out that

795
00:30:45.731 --> 00:30:48.355
there's coils in the way

796
00:30:48.355 --> 00:30:50.264
that you generate a scalar wave.

797
00:30:50.264 --> 00:30:53.699
They generate from, I didn't mention this earlier,

798
00:30:53.699 --> 00:30:55.395
but there's two electromagnetic waves

799
00:30:55.395 --> 00:30:57.763
that kind of come together,

800
00:30:57.763 --> 00:30:59.778
and they have identical frequencies,

801
00:30:59.778 --> 00:31:02.008
and the frequencies meet.

802
00:31:02.008 --> 00:31:03.522
Sometimes, where coils wrap around,

803
00:31:03.522 --> 00:31:05.517
but they meet, and they cancel each other.

804
00:31:05.517 --> 00:31:07.511
And that's what generates a scalar activity.

805
00:31:07.511 --> 00:31:09.111
It's one of the ways they try

806
00:31:09.111 --> 00:31:10.530
to do it from this level.

807
00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:11.692
To generate it.

808
00:31:11.692 --> 00:31:16.129
And my point is, you can generate this

809
00:31:16.129 --> 00:31:18.028
in the form of, what they call,

810
00:31:18.028 --> 00:31:20.097
a mobius coil, that's a scientific word

811
00:31:20.097 --> 00:31:21.814
to describe a shape.

812
00:31:21.814 --> 00:31:24.097
The point is, is that, in our DNA,

813
00:31:24.097 --> 00:31:25.164
we have these coils.

814
00:31:25.164 --> 00:31:27.047
<v Regina>I was going to say,</v>
<v ->We have thousands of these</v>

815
00:31:27.047 --> 00:31:29.042
coils in our DNA.

816
00:31:29.042 --> 00:31:31.015
And it's speculated, you know,

817
00:31:31.015 --> 00:31:32.433
it's not been proven, but it's speculated,

818
00:31:32.433 --> 00:31:36.348
that our DNA actually is giving off scalar communication

819
00:31:36.348 --> 00:31:38.929
to provide for the blueprint of our own life.

820
00:31:38.929 --> 00:31:40.113
<v ->That would make sense.</v>

821
00:31:40.113 --> 00:31:42.833
<v ->Yeah, and so, it's just an interesting point.</v>

822
00:31:42.833 --> 00:31:44.098
<v ->That's a very interesting point.</v>

823
00:31:44.098 --> 00:31:47.217
So, we get back to these ubiquitous spirals.

824
00:31:47.217 --> 00:31:48.412
<v ->Yeah. (laughs)</v>

825
00:31:48.412 --> 00:31:51.878
<v ->Okay, let's talk about the actual</v>

826
00:31:51.878 --> 00:31:54.300
physical application of the scalar waves

827
00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.548
and what you do, besides the fact

828
00:31:55.548 --> 00:31:57.222
that you are working with the consciousness

829
00:31:57.222 --> 00:31:59.313
of the business innately, and you

830
00:31:59.313 --> 00:32:00.475
go through a process.

831
00:32:00.475 --> 00:32:04.520
It's kind of a self-analysis,

832
00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:08.103
but also a Q &amp; A,in which you dredge up

833
00:32:08.103 --> 00:32:11.964
the genuine drives and motivations

834
00:32:11.964 --> 00:32:13.425
that the principle players have

835
00:32:13.425 --> 00:32:14.982
regarding the company, and you start

836
00:32:14.982 --> 00:32:16.401
seeing where the faults are.

837
00:32:16.401 --> 00:32:17.617
And so, once this has been done,

838
00:32:17.617 --> 00:32:20.891
and you actually start employing the technology

839
00:32:20.891 --> 00:32:23.494
that you're utilizing,

840
00:32:23.494 --> 00:32:25.958
you have a little device, which is a scalar wave.

841
00:32:25.958 --> 00:32:26.512
<v ->Right.</v>

842
00:32:26.512 --> 00:32:27.536
<v ->What is it?</v>

843
00:32:27.536 --> 00:32:30.278
Is it a broadcaster, booster, what would you call that?

844
00:32:30.278 --> 00:32:31.643
<v ->Well, we call it an antennae.</v>

845
00:32:31.643 --> 00:32:34.683
And we also give it a name called, "the Zinger."

846
00:32:34.683 --> 00:32:35.819
(laughs)
<v Regina>The Zinger, okay.</v>

847
00:32:36.489 --> 00:32:38.108
Now, what is this--

848
00:32:38.148 --> 00:32:41.761
let's talk about the technological interface,

849
00:32:41.761 --> 00:32:43.915
of what you're doing, and this little device,

850
00:32:43.915 --> 00:32:44.939
and the client.

851
00:32:44.939 --> 00:32:48.587
<v ->Well, I didn't actually have a discussion</v>

852
00:32:48.587 --> 00:32:50.187
with the man who created this,

853
00:32:50.187 --> 00:32:52.437
but he created it from specifications

854
00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:53.621
that he was able to learn

855
00:32:53.621 --> 00:32:55.829
from others who have passed on knowledge, I'm sure.

856
00:32:55.829 --> 00:32:59.776
And, we have both a tiny little scalar antennae,

857
00:32:59.776 --> 00:33:02.794
and then we have a larger antennae.

858
00:33:02.794 --> 00:33:04.789
And, there's, yeah.

859
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:07.162
<v Regina>Here. Go ahead and show</v>

860
00:33:07.162 --> 00:33:08.506
the little scalar to the camera.

861
00:33:08.506 --> 00:33:11.098
<v ->This is the little one right here.</v>

862
00:33:11.098 --> 00:33:13.307
Looks like a little Tinker Toy set.

863
00:33:13.307 --> 00:33:14.691
<v Regina>It does! It doesn't look like</v>

864
00:33:14.691 --> 00:33:15.858
it would be doing all that magic!

865
00:33:15.858 --> 00:33:17.041
<v ->No, doesn't look like it, does it?</v>

866
00:33:17.041 --> 00:33:19.857
And then, in my own office,

867
00:33:19.857 --> 00:33:21.606
we have a little larger scale,

868
00:33:21.606 --> 00:33:23.014
just in case you need a little bit more

869
00:33:23.014 --> 00:33:24.273
"oomph" to get out.

870
00:33:24.273 --> 00:33:26.289
Some people say it may not be necessary,

871
00:33:26.289 --> 00:33:28.657
but we work with companies around the world,

872
00:33:28.657 --> 00:33:30.449
so we want to make sure we have

873
00:33:30.449 --> 00:33:31.793
a little extra "oomph."

874
00:33:31.793 --> 00:33:34.329
So, basically, what we've done is,

875
00:33:34.329 --> 00:33:36.524
we have a computer program,

876
00:33:36.524 --> 00:33:37.552
that was designed through

877
00:33:37.552 --> 00:33:40.310
neuromodulation Dr. Feinberg, and

878
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:42.759
we were able to create this program

879
00:33:42.759 --> 00:33:46.545
in such a form that we can download it

880
00:33:46.545 --> 00:33:48.913
onto an MP3 at the end of the session

881
00:33:48.913 --> 00:33:50.406
that we have with her business.

882
00:33:50.406 --> 00:33:52.678
And in this program is contained the goals,

883
00:33:52.678 --> 00:33:54.971
and everything that the business

884
00:33:54.971 --> 00:33:57.318
wants to manifest as subject matter,

885
00:33:57.318 --> 00:33:59.899
and all the different pathways

886
00:33:59.899 --> 00:34:01.659
that were required to bring this company

887
00:34:01.659 --> 00:34:05.072
to 100% of its optimal potential are included.

888
00:34:05.072 --> 00:34:07.770
They're selected during the process.

889
00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.533
And all the things that we have, that we believe,

890
00:34:10.533 --> 00:34:12.314
such as our foundational principles,

891
00:34:12.314 --> 00:34:14.874
of which every business could be attuned to,

892
00:34:14.874 --> 00:34:16.101
would have greater success.

893
00:34:16.101 --> 00:34:18.863
And they're all put into this MP3 file,

894
00:34:18.863 --> 00:34:20.100
which, then, we download,

895
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.650
and send to the customer,

896
00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:24.559
and they're able to play it in their office,

897
00:34:24.559 --> 00:34:27.407
or on their MP3 players if they're traveling

898
00:34:27.407 --> 00:34:28.686
away from their office.

899
00:34:28.686 --> 00:34:31.982
And this allows them, in between our visits,

900
00:34:31.982 --> 00:34:33.731
to reinforce the whole intention

901
00:34:33.731 --> 00:34:36.163
of the process, and to reinforce

902
00:34:36.163 --> 00:34:37.817
the outcome probabilities

903
00:34:37.817 --> 00:34:40.204
that our work will do

904
00:34:40.204 --> 00:34:42.058
with helping the company reformulate.

905
00:34:42.058 --> 00:34:43.622
We've had companies tell us,

906
00:34:43.622 --> 00:34:47.722
that, when they are playing it, most if the employees,

907
00:34:47.722 --> 00:34:49.521
because they are kind of tuned in and knowing,

908
00:34:49.521 --> 00:34:50.801
they'll come up and say,

909
00:34:50.801 --> 00:34:52.401
"yeah, I know it's going on."

910
00:34:52.401 --> 00:34:53.510
They can feel it.

911
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:54.769
So many people.

912
00:34:54.769 --> 00:34:55.761
And when it's not going on,

913
00:34:55.761 --> 00:34:56.603
they come up and say,

914
00:34:56.603 --> 00:34:58.363
"Did you put that on today?" and no.

915
00:34:58.363 --> 00:35:02.363
So, there is a perceptibility on some level by people.

916
00:35:02.363 --> 00:35:03.750
And, they have a happy feeling

917
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.051
when it's being played.

918
00:35:05.051 --> 00:35:08.624
And, myself, even for the development of OMI,

919
00:35:08.624 --> 00:35:10.459
we've utilized this process to help

920
00:35:10.459 --> 00:35:12.805
allow for its growth to take place, too.

921
00:35:12.805 --> 00:35:14.757
<v ->Let's talk about some of the companies.</v>

922
00:35:14.757 --> 00:35:17.125
I mean, these are very highly-developed protocols

923
00:35:17.125 --> 00:35:18.106
that have taken place.

924
00:35:18.106 --> 00:35:19.887
And they've been developed over years.

925
00:35:19.887 --> 00:35:20.517
<v ->Yes.</v>

926
00:35:20.517 --> 00:35:24.815
<v ->And you're constantly refining and refining the process.</v>

927
00:35:24.815 --> 00:35:27.087
And, even since we last spoke,

928
00:35:27.087 --> 00:35:31.055
you're starting to see a quicker result

929
00:35:31.055 --> 00:35:33.124
in the effects, as a result of the refinement

930
00:35:33.124 --> 00:35:36.420
of the protocols, in conjunction with the scalar waves?

931
00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:37.955
<v ->Mm hm. Our intention as a company</v>

932
00:35:37.955 --> 00:35:42.955
is to bring the most potent, viable means

933
00:35:43.086 --> 00:35:46.420
of being able to upstart,

934
00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.692
or not necessarily upstart,

935
00:35:48.692 --> 00:35:51.316
but infuse a new life of energy

936
00:35:51.316 --> 00:35:53.609
into the companies that we work with,

937
00:35:53.609 --> 00:35:56.467
to allow for greater outcomes

938
00:35:56.467 --> 00:35:57.907
along the lines that they envision.

939
00:35:57.907 --> 00:35:59.305
<v ->Can you give us a couple of examples</v>

940
00:35:59.305 --> 00:36:01.928
of, in recent times, what you've seen

941
00:36:01.928 --> 00:36:05.406
by way of, sort of, spontaneous combustion?

942
00:36:05.406 --> 00:36:07.016
<v ->Well, yeah, I can.</v>

943
00:36:07.016 --> 00:36:08.733
We have a wonderful company

944
00:36:08.733 --> 00:36:10.259
we've been working with up in New York state.

945
00:36:10.259 --> 00:36:13.138
And they're a large health facility,

946
00:36:13.138 --> 00:36:15.421
they're not a smaller Mom-and-Pop operation,

947
00:36:15.421 --> 00:36:17.714
and one of the things that they're doing,

948
00:36:17.714 --> 00:36:19.549
and their work is spinal decompression,

949
00:36:19.549 --> 00:36:21.639
and they're doing other things as well,

950
00:36:21.639 --> 00:36:23.634
in their practices.

951
00:36:23.634 --> 00:36:25.820
Very healthy business.

952
00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.255
And even during this big, huge economic downturn,

953
00:36:29.255 --> 00:36:32.056
they were making choices,

954
00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:33.592
and we've been working with them,

955
00:36:33.592 --> 00:36:37.885
and they had exponential increases in their revenues

956
00:36:37.885 --> 00:36:40.093
during the time that we started working with them.

957
00:36:40.093 --> 00:36:42.919
And they even went out and bought

958
00:36:42.919 --> 00:36:45.938
additional spinal decompression chambers,

959
00:36:45.938 --> 00:36:47.964
which come at a very, very high cost.

960
00:36:47.964 --> 00:36:50.279
They were so confident in their business.

961
00:36:50.279 --> 00:36:52.028
And that business is feeding

962
00:36:52.028 --> 00:36:53.670
into other businesses, so they were really

963
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:56.017
having a very good outcome.

964
00:36:56.017 --> 00:36:58.033
They knew, beyond any shadow of a doubt,

965
00:36:58.033 --> 00:36:59.195
that what we were doing

966
00:36:59.195 --> 00:37:01.005
was really facilitating them along.

967
00:37:01.005 --> 00:37:04.140
They actually referred another company,

968
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.084
up in Maine, which we started working with.

969
00:37:07.084 --> 00:37:10.220
This company had lost money, successively,

970
00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.457
for the last three years,

971
00:37:11.457 --> 00:37:13.313
and each year, lost more than the year before.

972
00:37:13.313 --> 00:37:16.353
They just didn't see any hope in sight,

973
00:37:16.353 --> 00:37:17.991
but they were, of course,

974
00:37:17.991 --> 00:37:19.733
still working their business.

975
00:37:19.733 --> 00:37:21.707
And, we started working with them, and,

976
00:37:21.707 --> 00:37:24.522
I think it was by the second month

977
00:37:24.522 --> 00:37:25.706
that we checked in with them,

978
00:37:25.706 --> 00:37:27.402
and everything was starting to turn around

979
00:37:27.402 --> 00:37:28.586
by the third month.

980
00:37:28.586 --> 00:37:30.837
And, ever since, we've followed their tracks

981
00:37:30.837 --> 00:37:32.373
for months now, they've been doing

982
00:37:32.373 --> 00:37:36.362
successfully better than ever in the months before.

983
00:37:36.362 --> 00:37:38.442
I mean, their whole volume

984
00:37:38.442 --> 00:37:39.881
has increased and turned around.

985
00:37:39.881 --> 00:37:41.225
And they know.

986
00:37:41.225 --> 00:37:43.551
They know it's from the work that we did.

987
00:37:43.551 --> 00:37:44.361
I mean, they just know that

988
00:37:44.361 --> 00:37:46.036
that was a missing ingredient

989
00:37:46.036 --> 00:37:47.774
that helped make a turnaround for them.

990
00:37:47.774 --> 00:37:49.150
So, we work with companies

991
00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:50.473
to help them turn around,

992
00:37:50.473 --> 00:37:51.539
or companies that just want to

993
00:37:51.539 --> 00:37:53.161
just keep doing better and better.

994
00:37:53.161 --> 00:37:54.579
Because this is really about success,

995
00:37:54.579 --> 00:37:56.467
and success is about being able

996
00:37:56.467 --> 00:37:57.950
to be a good manifester.

997
00:37:57.950 --> 00:38:00.734
<v ->Absolutely. And you're bringing up a point</v>

998
00:38:00.734 --> 00:38:02.899
that I think is worth going into a little bit

999
00:38:02.899 --> 00:38:05.331
broader discussion about, because of the times.

1000
00:38:05.331 --> 00:38:07.858
We've been in a severe economic downturn.

1001
00:38:07.858 --> 00:38:10.813
No one's actually seeing an end in sight

1002
00:38:10.813 --> 00:38:12.231
any time soon for it.

1003
00:38:12.231 --> 00:38:15.762
Now, this brings about the concept

1004
00:38:15.762 --> 00:38:17.223
of the field of consciousness

1005
00:38:17.223 --> 00:38:18.900
in our collective beliefs.

1006
00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:21.830
And our collective beliefs, globally, really,

1007
00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:24.280
have been to go into fear, and go into a state

1008
00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.424
of lack, and want, and fear

1009
00:38:26.424 --> 00:38:30.434
around being able to manifest financially.

1010
00:38:30.434 --> 00:38:32.226
How...

1011
00:38:33.926 --> 00:38:37.506
How much is our very fear of this actually

1012
00:38:38.506 --> 00:38:42.333
propelling this recessionary state forward?

1013
00:38:42.333 --> 00:38:44.540
<v ->Well, I'm sure, quite a lot.</v>

1014
00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.701
I'm sure it's a huge factor.

1015
00:38:46.701 --> 00:38:48.536
I mean, the psychology of the public,

1016
00:38:48.536 --> 00:38:50.231
combined public, is everything in this country,

1017
00:38:50.231 --> 00:38:52.343
because it's got so much debt going on,

1018
00:38:52.343 --> 00:38:53.303
the only thing people can do

1019
00:38:53.303 --> 00:38:54.841
is possibly generate sales and retail

1020
00:38:54.841 --> 00:38:56.004
to keep everything alive,

1021
00:38:56.004 --> 00:38:58.905
because that's been its big, strong, forte.

1022
00:38:58.905 --> 00:39:00.878
Basically, it's the consumer.

1023
00:39:00.878 --> 00:39:02.574
And that's been pretty widely known,

1024
00:39:02.574 --> 00:39:05.987
that the mood of the public can really affect huge.

1025
00:39:05.987 --> 00:39:08.142
You know, everything in growth,

1026
00:39:08.142 --> 00:39:10.008
everything moves toward love,

1027
00:39:10.008 --> 00:39:11.907
and moves toward life.

1028
00:39:11.907 --> 00:39:14.178
This is where the cells have

1029
00:39:14.178 --> 00:39:15.874
the happiest participation,

1030
00:39:15.874 --> 00:39:17.922
and this is where all the movement goes.

1031
00:39:17.922 --> 00:39:19.501
It's pretty amazing.

1032
00:39:19.501 --> 00:39:21.239
It's just the way it is.

1033
00:39:21.239 --> 00:39:23.213
So, we work with individuals,

1034
00:39:23.213 --> 00:39:25.495
and if they're in fear states, again,

1035
00:39:25.495 --> 00:39:27.607
those are attunements, and they may

1036
00:39:27.607 --> 00:39:29.244
be coming out of their beliefs, or just

1037
00:39:29.244 --> 00:39:31.495
things that they've taken on from other people,

1038
00:39:31.495 --> 00:39:33.799
or certain individuals in the company.

1039
00:39:33.799 --> 00:39:35.633
We had a company just recently.

1040
00:39:35.633 --> 00:39:37.660
They were doing pretty well.

1041
00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:38.769
And then, all of the sudden,

1042
00:39:38.769 --> 00:39:39.814
they come out and say,

1043
00:39:39.814 --> 00:39:41.366
"I want to double our goals,

1044
00:39:41.366 --> 00:39:43.809
"and I want to do this within one or two months."

1045
00:39:43.809 --> 00:39:45.547
And it's like, really?

1046
00:39:45.547 --> 00:39:46.945
Okay, you want to double your goals

1047
00:39:46.945 --> 00:39:48.822
and achieve this within one or two months?

1048
00:39:48.822 --> 00:39:50.443
So I said okay.

1049
00:39:50.443 --> 00:39:53.003
And, you know, the smaller amount of time we have,

1050
00:39:53.003 --> 00:39:54.507
the more resistance it shows up.

1051
00:39:54.507 --> 00:39:55.392
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1052
00:39:55.392 --> 00:39:57.024
<v ->And one of the things I'm always so good at</v>

1053
00:39:57.024 --> 00:39:59.029
is being able to decrease the resistance

1054
00:39:59.029 --> 00:40:01.376
so that it can see the success take place.

1055
00:40:01.376 --> 00:40:03.093
Well, we worked with this company,

1056
00:40:03.093 --> 00:40:04.202
and they started having

1057
00:40:04.202 --> 00:40:06.314
everything on earth show up, (laughs)

1058
00:40:06.314 --> 00:40:08.447
that was in the way.

1059
00:40:08.447 --> 00:40:09.593
I mean, I could go through all the blocks

1060
00:40:09.593 --> 00:40:10.906
that came up for this person,

1061
00:40:10.906 --> 00:40:12.367
to the point where, one day,

1062
00:40:12.367 --> 00:40:13.839
she came in and she said,

1063
00:40:13.839 --> 00:40:15.087
the owner of the company, she said,

1064
00:40:15.087 --> 00:40:16.154
"I can't even get the phone

1065
00:40:16.154 --> 00:40:18.500
"from the cradle, up to my ear.

1066
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.527
"I feel like there's so much thick molasses."

1067
00:40:20.527 --> 00:40:22.073
And here's a lady, you know,

1068
00:40:22.073 --> 00:40:23.684
closing 50 accounts a month.

1069
00:40:25.474 --> 00:40:26.943
<v Regina>So this is extreme resistance.</v>

1070
00:40:26.943 --> 00:40:28.081
<v Thom>What we found is,</v>

1071
00:40:28.081 --> 00:40:29.873
that they worked through all the hurdles,

1072
00:40:29.873 --> 00:40:31.494
and the last one that we had to find,

1073
00:40:31.494 --> 00:40:33.136
it looked like the last one, any way,

1074
00:40:33.136 --> 00:40:36.208
was, they said, "oh, but on the good side

1075
00:40:36.208 --> 00:40:37.627
"we finally hired the two people

1076
00:40:37.627 --> 00:40:39.547
"that we'd really been looking for

1077
00:40:39.547 --> 00:40:41.243
"for a long time, and now they're on our team.

1078
00:40:41.243 --> 00:40:42.960
"And they're just starting."

1079
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.773
And I said, "well, that's interesting.

1080
00:40:44.773 --> 00:40:45.797
"Let's take a look."

1081
00:40:45.797 --> 00:40:48.325
And the company alignment was

1082
00:40:48.325 --> 00:40:50.117
all the way down to, like, 5%.

1083
00:40:50.117 --> 00:40:51.418
And it wasn't the owners.

1084
00:40:51.418 --> 00:40:53.157
The owners were up there.

1085
00:40:53.157 --> 00:40:54.714
It was the individuals new.

1086
00:40:54.714 --> 00:40:56.634
They were at, like, 1% or 2% aligned

1087
00:40:56.634 --> 00:40:57.871
with the company goals,

1088
00:40:57.871 --> 00:40:59.055
because they were brand new,

1089
00:40:59.055 --> 00:41:00.217
and they were bringing their own

1090
00:41:00.217 --> 00:41:02.052
subconscious past with them.

1091
00:41:02.052 --> 00:41:03.631
<v Regina>Which might be, "we can't do that</v>

1092
00:41:03.631 --> 00:41:05.801
"in one or two months," for example.

1093
00:41:05.801 --> 00:41:06.566
<v Thom>Maybe.</v>

1094
00:41:06.566 --> 00:41:07.504
<v ->I mean, just that belief system alone.</v>

1095
00:41:07.504 --> 00:41:09.104
<v ->Maybe, it's hard to say, exactly.</v>

1096
00:41:09.104 --> 00:41:11.099
And so, once we discovered

1097
00:41:11.099 --> 00:41:12.933
that that was the source

1098
00:41:12.933 --> 00:41:15.909
of a lot of this resistance, then we just

1099
00:41:15.909 --> 00:41:17.408
went to the individuals,

1100
00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:19.226
asked for their permission,

1101
00:41:19.226 --> 00:41:20.122
and then we included them in the next

1102
00:41:20.122 --> 00:41:22.010
company attunement, and voila!

1103
00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:23.215
<v ->And what happened?</v>

1104
00:41:23.215 --> 00:41:24.538
<v ->It's turning around.</v>

1105
00:41:24.538 --> 00:41:26.372
I don't have the final,

1106
00:41:26.372 --> 00:41:29.444
but it feels like everything
<v ->It is turning around.</v>

1107
00:41:29.444 --> 00:41:30.852
<v ->Yeah. It feels like it from the last</v>

1108
00:41:30.852 --> 00:41:32.843
input I had from the company.

1109
00:41:32.843 --> 00:41:34.635
We'll see them again, so.

1110
00:41:34.635 --> 00:41:37.024
<v ->How do you view the big picture, then?</v>

1111
00:41:37.024 --> 00:41:39.311
Because you're dealing, you're interfacing with companies

1112
00:41:39.311 --> 00:41:41.803
and their financial growth issues?

1113
00:41:41.803 --> 00:41:42.517
<v ->Right.</v>

1114
00:41:42.517 --> 00:41:43.840
<v Regina>About when you look at the</v>

1115
00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.730
anabolic and catabolic aspects to life,

1116
00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:50.282
I mean, things grow, there's life, there's night.

1117
00:41:50.282 --> 00:41:53.045
You know, dark and light, and so forth.

1118
00:41:53.045 --> 00:41:56.031
How do you view this on a large scale?

1119
00:41:56.031 --> 00:41:57.151
Because this would appear to be

1120
00:41:57.151 --> 00:41:59.594
a catabolic period of time,

1121
00:41:59.594 --> 00:42:02.025
in terms of the dying off of the cells

1122
00:42:02.025 --> 00:42:04.052
that aren't working for the organism any longer.

1123
00:42:04.052 --> 00:42:05.300
<v ->Yeah, in a sense, you might be able</v>

1124
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.039
to look at it that way.

1125
00:42:07.039 --> 00:42:08.756
Purging and pruning of the systems.

1126
00:42:08.756 --> 00:42:11.358
Well, change happens.

1127
00:42:11.358 --> 00:42:13.491
That's just part of life.

1128
00:42:13.491 --> 00:42:15.870
And being able to go with the change

1129
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:17.403
also is a huge thing.

1130
00:42:17.403 --> 00:42:19.258
It's a huge thing.

1131
00:42:19.258 --> 00:42:20.115
<v ->Are you finding this?</v>

1132
00:42:20.115 --> 00:42:22.116
You're having to do a lot deeper work

1133
00:42:22.116 --> 00:42:23.236
with people on this level

1134
00:42:23.236 --> 00:42:25.881
to overcome these kinds of concerns?

1135
00:42:25.881 --> 00:42:27.086
<v ->Well, the companies we're dealing with,</v>

1136
00:42:27.086 --> 00:42:28.484
mostly, are doing pretty good.

1137
00:42:28.484 --> 00:42:29.294
<v ->That's great.</v>

1138
00:42:29.294 --> 00:42:30.713
<v ->I would like to do an update.</v>

1139
00:42:30.713 --> 00:42:32.291
We were working with an investment group

1140
00:42:32.291 --> 00:42:34.030
out in New York City,
<v ->Oh, yeah, I remember that.</v>

1141
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:37.208
<v ->Well, they went into this period--</v>

1142
00:42:37.208 --> 00:42:38.552
I haven't talked to you since then,

1143
00:42:38.552 --> 00:42:39.491
but they went into this period,

1144
00:42:39.491 --> 00:42:40.387
like all the other,

1145
00:42:40.387 --> 00:42:43.064
and I got play-by-play feedback

1146
00:42:43.064 --> 00:42:44.195
coming out of them,

1147
00:42:44.195 --> 00:42:45.453
as to what was going on,

1148
00:42:45.453 --> 00:42:46.872
and it was like a horror show.

1149
00:42:46.872 --> 00:42:48.386
If you've ever lived in a horror show before,

1150
00:42:48.386 --> 00:42:50.370
that's exactly what was going on

1151
00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:52.941
for all these investment people in New York City.

1152
00:42:52.941 --> 00:42:55.757
And, these guys stuck true to the philosophy

1153
00:42:55.757 --> 00:42:58.210
that they had developed over time,

1154
00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:00.236
and we continued with their attunements

1155
00:43:00.236 --> 00:43:01.602
on a monthly basis.

1156
00:43:01.602 --> 00:43:04.364
And, not only did we increase their goals

1157
00:43:04.364 --> 00:43:05.580
a little bit, during the time

1158
00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:07.500
when everything was looking really sad,

1159
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.804
but we gave them, I think,

1160
00:43:09.804 --> 00:43:11.564
enough extra strength as well,

1161
00:43:11.564 --> 00:43:13.953
because every moment, they didn't know

1162
00:43:13.953 --> 00:43:15.051
what was going to happen.

1163
00:43:15.051 --> 00:43:16.257
Were they gonna leave the company?

1164
00:43:16.257 --> 00:43:18.369
They didn't know what was going to

1165
00:43:18.369 --> 00:43:19.275
happen to the markets.

1166
00:43:19.275 --> 00:43:21.838
Most of the investors and other groups were leaving.

1167
00:43:21.838 --> 00:43:24.843
And everything was changing so rapidly.

1168
00:43:24.843 --> 00:43:26.838
Well, they made it through this period.

1169
00:43:27.298 --> 00:43:28.703
And, not only did they make it

1170
00:43:28.703 --> 00:43:30.285
through the period, they only went down

1171
00:43:30.285 --> 00:43:32.798
about 8% on the total holdings.

1172
00:43:32.798 --> 00:43:33.651
<v Regina>You're kidding.</v>

1173
00:43:33.651 --> 00:43:36.072
<v ->So, all their investors are really happy</v>

1174
00:43:36.072 --> 00:43:39.955
that they were saved through this team.

1175
00:43:39.955 --> 00:43:41.416
And this team went on to become

1176
00:43:41.416 --> 00:43:45.341
just, like, middle to low middle average,

1177
00:43:45.341 --> 00:43:48.306
on the whole totem of traders

1178
00:43:48.306 --> 00:43:50.514
out of this large investment company.

1179
00:43:50.514 --> 00:43:52.114
In fact, this is the largest investment company

1180
00:43:52.114 --> 00:43:54.205
in the world today, that they worked for.

1181
00:43:54.205 --> 00:43:57.707
And they went on to become, for a couple months,

1182
00:43:57.707 --> 00:43:58.787
like, number two.

1183
00:43:58.787 --> 00:44:01.134
And they're now in the top 5%

1184
00:44:01.134 --> 00:44:03.246
of all the investment traders for this entity,

1185
00:44:03.246 --> 00:44:05.101
which is the worldwide leader now in investment.

1186
00:44:05.101 --> 00:44:06.680
<v Regina>That's amazing.</v>

1187
00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:10.208
<v ->So, I know we had some input in there.</v>

1188
00:44:10.208 --> 00:44:12.672
You can never didact out how much,

1189
00:44:12.672 --> 00:44:14.976
because there's so many different influences,

1190
00:44:14.976 --> 00:44:16.992
but I think they know, and we know,

1191
00:44:16.992 --> 00:44:19.629
there was something good that's been happening

1192
00:44:19.629 --> 00:44:20.971
as a result of our work with them.

1193
00:44:20.971 --> 00:44:23.254
<v ->That would certainly appear to be true.</v>

1194
00:44:23.254 --> 00:44:24.917
So, working with people now,

1195
00:44:24.917 --> 00:44:26.272
as people are looking at,

1196
00:44:26.272 --> 00:44:28.683
how do I restructure my business, my life?

1197
00:44:28.683 --> 00:44:29.589
Do I get out of this?

1198
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:31.285
Do I start something new to respond

1199
00:44:31.285 --> 00:44:32.330
to the new times?

1200
00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:34.282
Is a lot of your work now about

1201
00:44:34.282 --> 00:44:37.322
helping people understand, if they didn't already,

1202
00:44:37.322 --> 00:44:39.551
the need for really deep change,

1203
00:44:39.551 --> 00:44:41.151
fundamental changes that they

1204
00:44:41.151 --> 00:44:42.292
had never considered before.

1205
00:44:42.292 --> 00:44:43.263
Is that part of it?

1206
00:44:43.263 --> 00:44:44.468
<v ->Well, usually those changes</v>

1207
00:44:44.468 --> 00:44:47.231
become known to them more quickly.

1208
00:44:47.231 --> 00:44:50.025
When you discontinue false attunements,

1209
00:44:50.025 --> 00:44:52.478
or attunements to processing errors

1210
00:44:52.478 --> 00:44:54.526
that are no longer necessary,

1211
00:44:54.526 --> 00:44:55.636
and they can be released,

1212
00:44:55.636 --> 00:44:58.473
there's a whole spontaneous awareness.

1213
00:44:58.473 --> 00:45:00.190
That's part of our beauty of our work,

1214
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:02.120
is, we do work in consciousness

1215
00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.510
and in awareness, and help support them.

1216
00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:06.643
And we work with them, with their new goals,

1217
00:45:06.643 --> 00:45:08.381
we work in being with them,

1218
00:45:08.381 --> 00:45:09.853
when they're looking at their goals.

1219
00:45:09.853 --> 00:45:11.752
And the goals, of course, determine the direction

1220
00:45:11.752 --> 00:45:13.448
that they're taking things in.

1221
00:45:13.448 --> 00:45:15.186
And then we look at all the resistance factors

1222
00:45:15.186 --> 00:45:18.119
to the attunement and realization of the goals,

1223
00:45:18.119 --> 00:45:21.313
including what we call now, goal realization. (chuckles)

1224
00:45:22.823 --> 00:45:26.008
<v ->So, in effect, it really doesn't matter</v>

1225
00:45:26.008 --> 00:45:28.119
what's going on, in a sense,

1226
00:45:28.119 --> 00:45:30.210
in the world at large.

1227
00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:33.532
The field of potential, the scalar field--

1228
00:45:33.532 --> 00:45:35.001
<v ->Is there. And that's where the--</v>

1229
00:45:35.001 --> 00:45:36.547
<v Regina>Is still there, and can be utilized.</v>

1230
00:45:36.547 --> 00:45:38.990
<v ->It's where you're focusing your intention.</v>

1231
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:41.197
And there's a lot of places you can

1232
00:45:41.197 --> 00:45:42.797
put your attention these days,

1233
00:45:42.797 --> 00:45:45.208
and big beliefs that you have

1234
00:45:45.208 --> 00:45:46.765
about the outcome of society,

1235
00:45:46.765 --> 00:45:48.418
or life in general, or business,

1236
00:45:48.418 --> 00:45:50.413
a lot of it has to do with where

1237
00:45:50.413 --> 00:45:51.618
you're putting your intention.

1238
00:45:51.618 --> 00:45:53.410
And, granted, you may be in a market,

1239
00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:55.383
and the consumers are putting their intention

1240
00:45:55.383 --> 00:45:57.042
on fear and contraction,

1241
00:45:57.042 --> 00:45:58.669
so they don't buy your product.

1242
00:45:58.669 --> 00:46:00.952
But it doesn't stop you from going forward,

1243
00:46:00.952 --> 00:46:03.010
and this is the time to create more muscle

1244
00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:05.197
to do whatever has to be done

1245
00:46:05.197 --> 00:46:07.404
to generate your company's continuation,

1246
00:46:07.404 --> 00:46:09.794
and survival, and getting through the experience.

1247
00:46:09.794 --> 00:46:12.673
And, it's just a matter of focus.

1248
00:46:12.673 --> 00:46:16.032
Some companies are meant to just die off, you know?

1249
00:46:16.382 --> 00:46:18.157
<v Regina>Right, that's part of that process, too.</v>

1250
00:46:18.157 --> 00:46:19.910
<v Thom>Yeah, you--</v>
<v ->It's dead wood in society.</v>

1251
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:22.553
<v ->Right, you go with what's true and real.</v>

1252
00:46:22.553 --> 00:46:24.612
And you can kinda tell, you know,

1253
00:46:24.612 --> 00:46:26.446
what's going on with a company.

1254
00:46:26.446 --> 00:46:28.313
Some companies, you don't try

1255
00:46:28.313 --> 00:46:30.372
to put all the pieces back together.

1256
00:46:30.372 --> 00:46:31.673
But you can support them

1257
00:46:31.673 --> 00:46:33.646
in the conclusion of whatever they're doing,

1258
00:46:33.646 --> 00:46:36.110
if that's where they see the writings on the wall.

1259
00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:37.667
You can provide a really good support

1260
00:46:37.667 --> 00:46:39.032
for that transition, and for

1261
00:46:39.032 --> 00:46:40.547
their next stage of enfoldment.

1262
00:46:40.547 --> 00:46:42.211
We've seen that happen, too.

1263
00:46:42.211 --> 00:46:43.374
<v ->So it doesn't really have to be</v>

1264
00:46:43.374 --> 00:46:45.123
about devastation, even in the harshest

1265
00:46:45.123 --> 00:46:46.232
of economic times?

1266
00:46:46.232 --> 00:46:48.227
It's really more about a reformation.

1267
00:46:48.227 --> 00:46:49.902
<v ->Mm hm. Yup.</v>

1268
00:46:49.902 --> 00:46:51.832
And new opportunities.

1269
00:46:51.832 --> 00:46:52.899
There's always new beginnings

1270
00:46:52.899 --> 00:46:54.499
and opportunities knocking.

1271
00:46:54.499 --> 00:46:56.988
Also, I want to mention the Law of Floatation.

1272
00:46:58.928 --> 00:47:02.884
The Law of Floatation was, basically,

1273
00:47:02.884 --> 00:47:05.028
kinda discovered back in the time,

1274
00:47:05.028 --> 00:47:07.950
in the yesteryears of Europe, when they

1275
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:10.926
used to use metal for armor,

1276
00:47:10.926 --> 00:47:12.485
and the boat was made out of wood,

1277
00:47:12.485 --> 00:47:15.056
because wood floated and metal sank.

1278
00:47:15.056 --> 00:47:16.848
And that, at some point,

1279
00:47:16.848 --> 00:47:19.792
many hundred years later, somebody said,

1280
00:47:19.792 --> 00:47:22.191
"You know, maybe it's not that.

1281
00:47:22.191 --> 00:47:24.250
"Maybe it's displacement.

1282
00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:26.223
"Maybe if we displace the water,

1283
00:47:26.223 --> 00:47:28.079
"we can make metal float."

1284
00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:30.084
And, sure enough! (chuckles)

1285
00:47:30.084 --> 00:47:32.217
We have great metal boats these days.

1286
00:47:32.217 --> 00:47:35.193
And that was stepping outside the box,

1287
00:47:35.193 --> 00:47:36.718
so to speak, and looking at life

1288
00:47:36.718 --> 00:47:38.158
from a different viewpoint

1289
00:47:38.158 --> 00:47:40.462
to gain advantage, or to gain favor.

1290
00:47:40.462 --> 00:47:43.065
And to come with new creation,

1291
00:47:43.065 --> 00:47:44.547
new possibility, and, basically,

1292
00:47:44.547 --> 00:47:45.827
that's what OMI is.

1293
00:47:45.827 --> 00:47:46.915
We're in a frontier.

1294
00:47:46.915 --> 00:47:48.451
We're kind of opening the doors

1295
00:47:48.451 --> 00:47:50.307
for people to see these things.

1296
00:47:50.307 --> 00:47:51.983
And, bit by bit, as they see them,

1297
00:47:51.983 --> 00:47:52.868
they see how they work,

1298
00:47:52.868 --> 00:47:55.300
they realize that there is this quantum field,

1299
00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.902
and there is this whole potential manifestation,

1300
00:47:57.902 --> 00:48:00.686
that they are not taking full use of,

1301
00:48:00.686 --> 00:48:01.891
by any means.

1302
00:48:01.891 --> 00:48:04.633
Getting an energetic flow to a company

1303
00:48:04.633 --> 00:48:07.528
is like getting your house in order.

1304
00:48:07.528 --> 00:48:09.881
If you don't put some emphasis

1305
00:48:09.881 --> 00:48:11.769
on getting things cleaned up in the company,

1306
00:48:11.769 --> 00:48:13.646
you can have all these departments

1307
00:48:13.646 --> 00:48:15.289
projecting with adverse energy

1308
00:48:15.289 --> 00:48:16.846
toward other departments, and

1309
00:48:16.846 --> 00:48:20.536
these projections can just stop the flow.

1310
00:48:20.536 --> 00:48:22.446
You can have people focusing on

1311
00:48:22.446 --> 00:48:24.376
drawing out the best out of a person,

1312
00:48:24.376 --> 00:48:26.072
or putting them down, and trying

1313
00:48:26.072 --> 00:48:27.715
to keep things the way they were.

1314
00:48:27.715 --> 00:48:29.176
And there's just so many different ways

1315
00:48:29.176 --> 00:48:30.893
that you can put your attention.

1316
00:48:30.893 --> 00:48:32.408
The other thing is that,

1317
00:48:32.408 --> 00:48:33.730
because we work with all people, places,

1318
00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:36.186
and things in a company,

1319
00:48:36.186 --> 00:48:39.716
there is a common sense of,

1320
00:48:39.716 --> 00:48:41.764
that you can have a greater achievement

1321
00:48:41.764 --> 00:48:43.875
when you put these aspects into

1322
00:48:43.875 --> 00:48:45.710
greater resonance with each other.

1323
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:47.011
And that's what we do.

1324
00:48:47.011 --> 00:48:48.174
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1325
00:48:48.174 --> 00:48:49.934
Because then we get into what is called

1326
00:48:49.934 --> 00:48:52.046
the "Theory of Entanglement",

1327
00:48:52.046 --> 00:48:53.251
the science of entanglement,

1328
00:48:53.251 --> 00:48:55.043
and you can't get away from the fact

1329
00:48:55.043 --> 00:48:57.197
that we are all entangled.

1330
00:48:57.197 --> 00:48:58.552
So, if one part isn't working,

1331
00:48:58.552 --> 00:49:00.248
or is working in a different consciousness

1332
00:49:00.248 --> 00:49:02.498
than the other, it is going to affect the whole.

1333
00:49:02.498 --> 00:49:04.333
And it sounds like you have systems

1334
00:49:04.333 --> 00:49:07.469
well in place to be able to answer that.

1335
00:49:07.469 --> 00:49:09.879
And, again, I thank you so much

1336
00:49:09.879 --> 00:49:11.692
for sharing this with us.

1337
00:49:11.692 --> 00:49:13.410
I'm sure many people are going to be

1338
00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:14.871
looking at their businesses in a new way.

1339
00:49:14.871 --> 00:49:16.449
<v ->Well, I hope they do,</v>

1340
00:49:16.449 --> 00:49:17.932
because there's so much that they

1341
00:49:17.932 --> 00:49:19.233
can take advantage of.

1342
00:49:19.233 --> 00:49:24.233
And for not much on their end, it can serve them.

1343
00:49:24.246 --> 00:49:26.028
<v Regina>Yes, thank you Tom.</v>

1344
00:49:26.028 --> 00:49:27.228
<v ->You're welcome.</v>

1345
00:49:28.768 --> 00:49:30.586
<v ->If you'd like to check into this technology,</v>

1346
00:49:30.586 --> 00:49:33.700
you can reach Tom at OptimalModification.com.

1347
00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:35.161
Meanwhile, to delve into

1348
00:49:35.161 --> 00:49:36.953
the physical healing ramifications

1349
00:49:36.953 --> 00:49:39.246
of this technology, you might enjoy our interview

1350
00:49:39.246 --> 00:49:42.158
with Tom's mentor, Dr. Leslie Feinberg.

1351
00:49:42.158 --> 00:49:44.942
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1352
00:49:44.942 --> 00:49:48.018
