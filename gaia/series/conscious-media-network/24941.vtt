1
00:00:00.642 --> 00:00:03.373
<v ->Schlomo Shoham is the rarest of men.</v>

2
00:00:03.373 --> 00:00:05.655
Raised in a strict Jewish tradition,

3
00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:07.831
he knew from an early age that every one of us

4
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:09.894
is in direct contact with spirit.

5
00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:12.012
In his early 30s he was appointed to

6
00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:13.900
a judge's seat in Israel,

7
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.471
imbuing him with extraordinary levels of power

8
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:18.007
over the lives of others.

9
00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:19.841
Since then, his life's journey

10
00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:21.891
has been in search of authentic power,

11
00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:24.952
and he now imparts his knowledge to other judges,

12
00:00:24.952 --> 00:00:26.552
and through his appointment to

13
00:00:26.552 --> 00:00:29.592
the Parliamentary Committee for Future Generations.

14
00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:31.847
We met with him in Jerusalem.

15
00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:35.911 line:15% 
(inspirational music)

16
00:00:40.183 --> 00:00:42.903
Here's a man that has been very highly trained

17
00:00:42.903 --> 00:00:46.263
and developed with the intellect as an attorney,

18
00:00:46.263 --> 00:00:47.820
as a judge,

19
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.468
and now serving in the Knesset.

20
00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:54.347
And, at the same time, you're also noted for

21
00:00:54.347 --> 00:00:56.854
being a highly spiritual man.

22
00:00:56.854 --> 00:00:58.529
Now, this is an anomaly for me

23
00:00:58.529 --> 00:01:00.086
because I don't think I've ever met

24
00:01:00.086 --> 00:01:02.704
a conscious politician. (laughs)

25
00:01:03.424 --> 00:01:05.867
So why don't we start with you,

26
00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:09.141
and I assume you didn't pop out this way,

27
00:01:09.141 --> 00:01:11.509
so where was the marriage of consciousness

28
00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.272
and what you do for a living?

29
00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:17.550
<v ->I think the marriage of consciousness</v>

30
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.477
and spirituality were when I was born.

31
00:01:22.987 --> 00:01:25.673
I grew up in a religious family,

32
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.532
and in this religious family...

33
00:01:29.252 --> 00:01:30.831
We were Hasidic family,

34
00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:34.825
which is more spiritual, religious, orthodox family.

35
00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:39.769
I have to thank God and thank my family

36
00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:41.881
that they brought me this way,

37
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:46.021
because, although I left doing the Mitzvot,

38
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:49.153
doing the rules of the Judaism,

39
00:01:50.268 --> 00:01:53.142
teach as I was young,

40
00:01:54.435 --> 00:01:57.261
all my life were the questions

41
00:01:57.261 --> 00:02:00.514
in dealing with the dilemmas of

42
00:02:00.514 --> 00:02:03.315
who is God, what God wants from us,

43
00:02:04.526 --> 00:02:07.195
and the feeling that every cell,

44
00:02:07.195 --> 00:02:09.259
each and every cell in my body,

45
00:02:10.055 --> 00:02:12.220
is a part of God,

46
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.118
and God is not separate from me

47
00:02:14.118 --> 00:02:16.277
and from you and from the whole world,

48
00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:20.017
and it's only our linear brain that

49
00:02:20.017 --> 00:02:24.176
creates the differentiation between us and God,

50
00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:27.765
or creates a separation between our energies.

51
00:02:28.336 --> 00:02:29.439
This was thing that,

52
00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:33.461
things that I was brought up with,

53
00:02:33.461 --> 00:02:38.148
and they were part of my feelings, my emotions, all my life.

54
00:02:38.922 --> 00:02:42.233
So this is a place that I began from.

55
00:02:42.953 --> 00:02:46.574
I can see that more consciously

56
00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:51.939
I came to this world that is called spiritual world,

57
00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:54.080
I don't like the word spiritualism, I don't think.

58
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.263
<v Regina>Yes, I understand.</v>

59
00:02:55.263 --> 00:02:57.390
It's a word that has far too many...

60
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.282
<v ->In a way, I prefer to speak about,</v>

61
00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.933
be more aware of, of this stuff that we are not...

62
00:03:08.328 --> 00:03:11.806
We're not more aware that we're not captive of our senses,

63
00:03:11.806 --> 00:03:15.255
that there are a lot of things beyond our senses.

64
00:03:15.752 --> 00:03:18.626
I came to see one as stronger when I was a judge.

65
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.298
You know, when I was the youngest judge in Israel

66
00:03:21.298 --> 00:03:23.922
when I was appointed, I was 34 years old,

67
00:03:23.922 --> 00:03:26.823
and, you know, the ego loves it very much.

68
00:03:26.823 --> 00:03:29.500
You sit up there and you have a lot of control,

69
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.420
and people, power,

70
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.907
when you tell a joke, everybody's laughing, 'cause--

71
00:03:33.907 --> 00:03:35.368
<v Regina>Because they have to?</v>

72
00:03:35.368 --> 00:03:36.669
<v ->They have to.
(Regina laughing)

73
00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:38.088
Tomorrow morning they're going to be

74
00:03:38.088 --> 00:03:40.034
in a trial in front of you.

75
00:03:41.938 --> 00:03:43.549
And there go, ego loves it.

76
00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.258
And it took me some, I think, year or two

77
00:03:46.258 --> 00:03:50.419
until I was asking myself, "What are you doing there?"

78
00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:51.720
<v Regina>Because you're--</v>

79
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.875
<v ->"And why are you sending people to jail all your life?"</v>

80
00:03:53.875 --> 00:03:55.016
It's kind of a,

81
00:03:55.016 --> 00:03:56.574
it's not easy to be,

82
00:03:56.574 --> 00:03:57.875
especially in Israel, you know,

83
00:03:57.875 --> 00:04:00.797
a judge in Israel has a lot, a lot of authorities,

84
00:04:00.797 --> 00:04:03.656
and I was the only judge in a city,

85
00:04:03.656 --> 00:04:06.376
not an easy city in Israel, in Ashdod.

86
00:04:06.376 --> 00:04:09.362
Many, many criminals, murderers, you know,

87
00:04:09.362 --> 00:04:11.841
drug dealers, everything.

88
00:04:14.727 --> 00:04:16.492
And it was amazing, there was...

89
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.022
You've got it in the anything.

90
00:04:20.465 --> 00:04:23.441
I was sitting there and asked myself,

91
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:26.934
"Why me, Schlomo Shoham, is doing it?

92
00:04:27.985 --> 00:04:30.933
"What is my lesson from this,

93
00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:34.907
"and how I can be a real human being

94
00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:36.582
"and a human judge,"

95
00:04:36.582 --> 00:04:38.666
things that sometimes doesn't go together.

96
00:04:40.295 --> 00:04:43.769
And it was amazing, this, what happened there.

97
00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:46.313
I came by chance,

98
00:04:46.313 --> 00:04:48.579
but there is not any chance in the world, as you know,

99
00:04:49.214 --> 00:04:53.161
to be aware more to the spiritual world,

100
00:04:53.161 --> 00:04:56.924
to by energetics, to authentic medicine,

101
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.957
and I began to learn psychotherapy,

102
00:04:59.957 --> 00:05:02.457
alternative psychotherapy meditations,

103
00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:08.039
in those years and, what I can say,

104
00:05:10.772 --> 00:05:14.458
that, more and more, I was aware of

105
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.332
what is my lesson in being a judge.

106
00:05:20.245 --> 00:05:21.845
You know, sometimes you can not

107
00:05:21.845 --> 00:05:25.071
run a society without judging people,

108
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.228
but what it means to Schlomo Shoham,

109
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.758
that he is judging all the time,

110
00:05:32.084 --> 00:05:35.801
and you know judgments are killing.

111
00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:38.862
Judging is killing.

112
00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:44.291
There is a story about an old man that has a horse.

113
00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:46.185
It's a very nice story.

114
00:05:46.185 --> 00:05:48.632
It's a little, I think, esoteric.

115
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.168
He was very poor but he has one horse,

116
00:05:52.168 --> 00:05:55.078
and this horse was a unique horse, very nice,

117
00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:57.841
and everybody want to buy this horse.

118
00:05:58.145 --> 00:06:00.492
And he said, "It's not a horse, it's a friend,

119
00:06:00.492 --> 00:06:02.017
"and how can you sell a friend?

120
00:06:02.017 --> 00:06:03.574
"I am not selling it."

121
00:06:03.574 --> 00:06:05.601
And then the king came to this guy and said,

122
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:09.093
"Listen, I'll pay you the whole you house, gold.

123
00:06:09.093 --> 00:06:10.468
Just give me the horse."

124
00:06:10.468 --> 00:06:12.749
And he said, "It's not a horse, it's a friend,

125
00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:14.375
"and how can you sell a friend?"

126
00:06:14.658 --> 00:06:16.230
And he didn't sell.

127
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.153
After some days, the horse ran away.

128
00:06:20.716 --> 00:06:22.903
So all the people from the village came to this old man,

129
00:06:22.903 --> 00:06:24.855
say, "You stupid old man.

130
00:06:24.855 --> 00:06:25.971
"You could have sell the horse

131
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:28.610
"and you could have been a very, very rich man.

132
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.913
"Now you don't have a horse and you don't have money.

133
00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:33.715
"This horse is not a blessing, it's a curse."

134
00:06:34.446 --> 00:06:36.477
And he said, "You can not judge.

135
00:06:36.507 --> 00:06:39.184
"All that you can say, that there was a horse,

136
00:06:39.184 --> 00:06:40.618
"and that the horse ran away.

137
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.167
"This is the only thing you can say."

138
00:06:43.685 --> 00:06:47.002
After some days, the horse came back from the wilderness,

139
00:06:47.002 --> 00:06:50.709
and he came back with another 12 very nice horses with him.

140
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.038
A little training and they worth a lot of money.

141
00:06:54.598 --> 00:06:57.126
So the people from the village gathered again

142
00:06:57.126 --> 00:07:00.928
and said, "Ok, Old Man, you were right.

143
00:07:01.286 --> 00:07:03.691
"This horse is not a curse, it's a blessing."

144
00:07:04.464 --> 00:07:06.133
So what he said to them?

145
00:07:06.768 --> 00:07:08.230
"Again, you are going too far.

146
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.734
"You can not say anything about

147
00:07:09.734 --> 00:07:11.541
"if it's a curse or it's a blessing.

148
00:07:12.133 --> 00:07:13.909
"Life comes in fragments.

149
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.261
"So the only thing that you can say,

150
00:07:16.261 --> 00:07:18.936
"that there was a horse, now there's no horses,

151
00:07:18.936 --> 00:07:21.063
"now there are 12 horses."

152
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:25.069
When you read the page in a book,

153
00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:26.786
you can not judge the whole book.

154
00:07:26.786 --> 00:07:30.423
When you read a letter in a page,

155
00:07:30.423 --> 00:07:32.305
you can not judge the whole page.

156
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.040
And what we are doing, all the time we are judging.

157
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.797
And judgments is something that we are stuck in it.

158
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.808
All the time you are stuck.

159
00:07:42.808 --> 00:07:46.637
And judging is something that gives us

160
00:07:46.637 --> 00:07:48.583
an illusion of attachment.

161
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.345
But it's not really living.

162
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.485
If you will look in your life and see

163
00:07:53.485 --> 00:07:56.006
what were the happiest moments in your life,

164
00:07:56.428 --> 00:07:58.684
judging was not there.

165
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:02.374
It was kind of letting go, abandons,

166
00:08:02.604 --> 00:08:07.604
a play that you say, "Ok, I am one with the universe,

167
00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:13.321
"one with God, one with the trees, one with the animals."

168
00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:18.520
So, and the story goes on.

169
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.653
<v Regina>But what d-, so what did you learn?</v>

170
00:08:20.653 --> 00:08:23.417
About yourself, this is getting juicy.

171
00:08:23.417 --> 00:08:25.134
<v ->Yes. (stammers)
(Regina laughs)

172
00:08:25.134 --> 00:08:28.637
The story goes on and then the story is like the...

173
00:08:30.339 --> 00:08:31.896
His son was training the horses,

174
00:08:31.896 --> 00:08:34.051
and he fallen and he broke his leg,

175
00:08:34.051 --> 00:08:35.235
and all the people from the c-

176
00:08:35.235 --> 00:08:36.717
said, "This horse is a curse."

177
00:08:36.717 --> 00:08:38.018
He said, "You can not judge,"

178
00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:39.533
and etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

179
00:08:39.533 --> 00:08:42.530
Then there was a war and they took all the kids to the war,

180
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.588
but his son was handicapped so they didn't take his son.

181
00:08:46.978 --> 00:08:49.649
So what I learned in my life,

182
00:08:51.255 --> 00:08:55.707
that first, those minutes, they were like the...

183
00:08:56.524 --> 00:08:58.768
worst crisis in my life.

184
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.832
The places that I thought, it can not be worse,

185
00:09:02.977 --> 00:09:05.398
they were really, I can say,

186
00:09:05.398 --> 00:09:07.568
the biggest lessons that I get in my life.

187
00:09:07.968 --> 00:09:12.968
And I realized to learn that everything that comes in life,

188
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:17.349
it's kind of a picture that I have to learn from this,

189
00:09:17.589 --> 00:09:21.200
and if I go beyond this very minute,

190
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:26.704
a little bit take out myself outside of the mud,

191
00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:31.966
I see life rich, happy, and in a powerful situation,

192
00:09:35.211 --> 00:09:36.811
from a powerful situation that is

193
00:09:36.811 --> 00:09:39.882
not captive of this drama of this very minute,

194
00:09:39.882 --> 00:09:43.119
of this sadness or horrible things or whatever it is.

195
00:09:44.703 --> 00:09:46.261
This what I learned from this,

196
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:47.861
and this what I learned also from being a judge,

197
00:09:47.861 --> 00:09:52.345
because I learned that judging people,

198
00:09:53.364 --> 00:09:55.331
first of all, is very painful.

199
00:09:55.412 --> 00:09:57.407
When I was judge, I was not aware

200
00:09:57.407 --> 00:09:59.331
to how much painful it is.

201
00:09:59.455 --> 00:10:01.582
Because there is, you know, a very, very...

202
00:10:04.212 --> 00:10:07.363
kind of, you know, in the courtroom,

203
00:10:07.625 --> 00:10:09.737
there are separation between the judge

204
00:10:09.737 --> 00:10:11.870
and the accused ones and the people--

205
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.032
<v Regina>You always sit higher.</v>

206
00:10:13.032 --> 00:10:14.408
<v ->Sit, always sit higher,</v>

207
00:10:14.408 --> 00:10:16.264
you feel like, you know, you're almost God,

208
00:10:16.264 --> 00:10:17.747
everybody's bowing to you.

209
00:10:17.747 --> 00:10:19.603
After some days, you believe that you are God.

210
00:10:19.603 --> 00:10:21.922
Everybody says, "Yes, your Honor, no, your Honor,"

211
00:10:22.025 --> 00:10:25.396
and it's like, and when you really realize

212
00:10:25.749 --> 00:10:29.724
that it's not like this, then you really understands...

213
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:32.332
When you go beyond the ego then, then I re-

214
00:10:32.332 --> 00:10:34.359
When I went beyond the ego, the ego--

215
00:10:34.359 --> 00:10:35.426
<v Regina>The ego, yes.</v>

216
00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:37.068
<v ->Sometimes I realize,</v>

217
00:10:37.068 --> 00:10:38.467
it was not easy to do it all the time,

218
00:10:38.467 --> 00:10:41.971
you know the ego is, has it's own way of living,

219
00:10:42.735 --> 00:10:45.075
but I realized how much painful it is,

220
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.310
and how much painful is to send,

221
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.725
I think, in my life, thousand people to jail.

222
00:10:50.211 --> 00:10:51.907
It-it's really horrible,

223
00:10:51.907 --> 00:10:53.859
it's something that I have to go all my life

224
00:10:53.859 --> 00:10:57.522
and do other things to, in a way, repair it,

225
00:10:57.827 --> 00:10:59.613
to create a balance,

226
00:10:59.875 --> 00:11:03.581
because it's really painful.

227
00:11:03.843 --> 00:11:05.970
So this was the first thing that I learned

228
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.421
from, let's say, the spiritual world,

229
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:11.729
of being aware of what's going on there.

230
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:18.280
And then I did something that judges usually don't do,

231
00:11:18.754 --> 00:11:19.900
I quit.

232
00:11:20.237 --> 00:11:22.605
I left being a judge and I went to the parliament,

233
00:11:22.605 --> 00:11:23.963
to the Israeli parliament.

234
00:11:23.963 --> 00:11:25.957
In the beginning I was legal advisor of the

235
00:11:25.957 --> 00:11:28.159
Constitution and Law Committee,

236
00:11:28.346 --> 00:11:30.554
and then I was, I was appointed to be

237
00:11:30.554 --> 00:11:32.404
the Commissioner for Future Generations.

238
00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:34.569
The first commissioner in Israel,

239
00:11:34.938 --> 00:11:38.441
which is a great thing to do because I...

240
00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.348
First of all, it's a very creative place,

241
00:11:41.348 --> 00:11:43.230
it's a new position,

242
00:11:43.599 --> 00:11:45.828
very powerful with a lot of authorities,

243
00:11:45.828 --> 00:11:50.536
and judges usually judge things that happened in the past.

244
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.399
And judges usually deal with the traumas of the past.

245
00:11:55.034 --> 00:11:58.330
And although sometime there is no other alternative,

246
00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:59.994
we have to send people to jail,

247
00:11:59.994 --> 00:12:02.138
you don't really cure people.

248
00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.175
You don't really repair things,

249
00:12:04.175 --> 00:12:06.502
you don't really bring love to the world.

250
00:12:06.502 --> 00:12:08.272
Usually what you do,

251
00:12:08.272 --> 00:12:10.405
the main thing that you do is incapacitation.

252
00:12:10.405 --> 00:12:13.584
You take people, so the times that they're in jail,

253
00:12:13.584 --> 00:12:15.706
they don't hit on other people, or don't murder,

254
00:12:15.706 --> 00:12:17.778
or don't rape, or these kind of things.

255
00:12:17.778 --> 00:12:19.121
<v Regina>And you,</v>

256
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:21.784
if I may just interject something at this point.

257
00:12:22.558 --> 00:12:27.464
You, after you began understanding things in this way,

258
00:12:27.464 --> 00:12:28.787
about judgment,

259
00:12:28.787 --> 00:12:32.279
had a very profound effect on some individuals,

260
00:12:32.573 --> 00:12:35.122
and one of them is named Meir,

261
00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:37.234
and we've talked with Meir as well,

262
00:12:37.234 --> 00:12:42.234
and he said, trough an interesting series of events,

263
00:12:42.301 --> 00:12:45.129
not by accident, no accidents in the world,

264
00:12:45.479 --> 00:12:46.698
that he had met you.

265
00:12:46.698 --> 00:12:48.693
And am I clear in understanding

266
00:12:48.693 --> 00:12:50.269
you were still a judge at this time,

267
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:52.057
or was, were you...

268
00:12:52.873 --> 00:12:55.179
<v ->No, when he met me first, I was still a judge.</v>

269
00:12:55.179 --> 00:12:55.989
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

270
00:12:55.989 --> 00:12:57.312
<v ->What happened, that I began to learn</v>

271
00:12:57.312 --> 00:12:59.770
and I began to be a meditation teacher,

272
00:13:00.565 --> 00:13:02.890
and a bioenergetic therapist.

273
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.508
This was my way of learning,

274
00:13:06.186 --> 00:13:10.196
and it was a strange combination,

275
00:13:10.196 --> 00:13:11.379
to be a judge in the morning--

276
00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:12.216
<v Regina>A judge and a--</v>

277
00:13:12.216 --> 00:13:13.334
<v ->a meditation teacher</v>

278
00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:14.323
at night.
<v Regina>meditation te-</v>

279
00:13:14.323 --> 00:13:15.057
It's wonderful.

280
00:13:15.057 --> 00:13:16.241
<v Schlomo>It's really amazing.</v>

281
00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:19.217
And I know that the world brought me the place

282
00:13:19.217 --> 00:13:22.097
I have to make a tikun, we say it in Hebrew,

283
00:13:22.097 --> 00:13:25.074
a kind of a repair, kind of how healing

284
00:13:25.074 --> 00:13:26.971
for the places,
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

285
00:13:26.971 --> 00:13:28.230
<v Schlomo>for the wounded places in</v>

286
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.245
the criminals bodies and souls,

287
00:13:30.245 --> 00:13:32.016
and in my body and soul.

288
00:13:32.016 --> 00:13:36.101
So it's like this kind of repairing, of healing,

289
00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:38.011
brought us together, and maybe this

290
00:13:38.011 --> 00:13:39.164
<v Regina>How did this happen?</v>

291
00:13:39.164 --> 00:13:41.138
<v ->is only one of the stories, but it's like, uh,</v>

292
00:13:41.138 --> 00:13:42.471
it's one of them.
<v Regina>But it's,</v>

293
00:13:42.471 --> 00:13:43.815
it was such a beautiful story.

294
00:13:43.815 --> 00:13:48.815
<v ->Meir was on his way to a drug party in that scene,</v>

295
00:13:49.832 --> 00:13:54.832
and I was in another place leading meditation camp,

296
00:13:56.477 --> 00:13:58.259
and, by chance, there's no,

297
00:13:58.259 --> 00:14:00.093
nothing by accident, as you said.

298
00:14:00.093 --> 00:14:02.252
But he was, he stopped there,

299
00:14:03.026 --> 00:14:05.695
and, don't remember,

300
00:14:05.695 --> 00:14:07.604
but I think he needed water or something,

301
00:14:07.604 --> 00:14:09.454
with friends or something, and he came.

302
00:14:09.716 --> 00:14:10.825
And somebody told him, "Listen,

303
00:14:10.825 --> 00:14:13.913
"there is a crazy judge who is teaching meditation."

304
00:14:14.121 --> 00:14:15.380
He knew what a judge is,

305
00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.624
he didn't know nothing about what is meditation.

306
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.088
But he said he was curious and he came inside.

307
00:14:20.574 --> 00:14:23.149
And a great thing happened to him and to me.

308
00:14:24.638 --> 00:14:28.472
<v ->I go in party and I look.</v>

309
00:14:28.723 --> 00:14:31.103
I want to see is a drink, coffee.

310
00:14:31.103 --> 00:14:36.103
I look, one man, little man, and uh...

311
00:14:38.996 --> 00:14:42.894
tell me, "Excuse me, come here.

312
00:14:43.102 --> 00:14:44.617
"Yes, what you want?"

313
00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:45.918
Tell me, "You know me?"

314
00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:48.259
But I not remember.

315
00:14:49.116 --> 00:14:52.817
Tell me, "I am Shin-Shin, I am Schlomo Shoham.

316
00:14:52.961 --> 00:14:55.053
"I am a judge, judge."

317
00:14:55.053 --> 00:14:56.258
<v Regina>Judge, yes.</v>

318
00:14:56.258 --> 00:14:57.532
<v ->Judge.</v>

319
00:14:57.677 --> 00:14:59.132
"And I know you.

320
00:14:59.767 --> 00:15:00.834
"I know you.

321
00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:03.612
"All the country know you, but I know you, uh,

322
00:15:06.103 --> 00:15:09.809
"before you very, very problem."

323
00:15:10.327 --> 00:15:12.315
"Ok, what you want," I tell him.

324
00:15:12.694 --> 00:15:16.806
"I want to bust but five minute."

325
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:19.826
If you want five minute talk to me,

326
00:15:20.547 --> 00:15:22.845
ok, five minute, no problem.

327
00:15:23.192 --> 00:15:26.994
Is tell me, "You know what is it, meditation?"

328
00:15:27.725 --> 00:15:28.973

"Ok, I come, five minute."

353
00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.045
Look what is meditation.

354
00:16:20.045 --> 00:16:23.292
I am listen but what is meditation, I want to look.

355
00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:27.068
Ok, I come in Schlomo Shoham.

356
00:16:27.884 --> 00:16:32.788
It's a group telling, tell me, "Sit."

357
00:16:32.858 --> 00:16:35.226
I am sit, a meditation,

358
00:16:35.648 --> 00:16:38.778
and after maybe five, six minute,

359
00:16:39.968 --> 00:16:42.501
here, it's no problem.

360
00:16:42.645 --> 00:16:47.645
Here, no, I'm like, I want to (speaks Hebrew).

361
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.602
<v Regina>What is he saying?</v>

362
00:16:50.602 --> 00:16:51.626
<v ->I want to cry.</v>

363
00:16:51.626 --> 00:16:52.458
<v Man>To cry.</v>

364
00:16:52.458 --> 00:16:53.503
<v Regina>To cry.</v>

365
00:16:53.503 --> 00:16:54.229
<v ->To cry.</v>

366
00:16:54.229 --> 00:16:56.063
I don't know what is it, crying, crying.

367
00:16:56.063 --> 00:16:58.495
I don't know what is cry, crying.

368
00:16:58.495 --> 00:17:00.383
<v Regina>You weren't accustomed to crying?</v>

369
00:17:00.383 --> 00:17:02.606
<v ->No, maybe if I am a...</v>

370
00:17:03.209 --> 00:17:04.233
<v Regina>A baby.</v>

371
00:17:04.233 --> 00:17:05.652
<v ->Maybe, I don't remember.</v>

372
00:17:05.652 --> 00:17:08.084
Maybe, if I am a (speaks Hebrew)

373
00:17:08.084 --> 00:17:08.905
<v Man>A baby.</v>

374
00:17:08.905 --> 00:17:09.716
<v ->A baby.</v>

375
00:17:09.716 --> 00:17:12.611
But not cry, a man not crying.

376
00:17:13.011 --> 00:17:15.006
<v Regina>Especially a tough man. (laughs)</v>

377
00:17:15.006 --> 00:17:18.024
<v ->Yes, and I don't know what is,</v>

378
00:17:18.024 --> 00:17:20.109
what's happened me.

379
00:17:20.584 --> 00:17:21.972
What's happen?

380
00:17:21.972 --> 00:17:23.641
I want to cry.

381
00:17:24.084 --> 00:17:28.031
I want to go, it's tell me maybe Shin-Shin,

382
00:17:28.031 --> 00:17:29.471
it's look at me.

383
00:17:29.471 --> 00:17:32.441
It's telling, "Stop, one minute, stop."

384
00:17:33.211 --> 00:17:36.430
And it's touch me, here,

385
00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:40.206
and I'm in all the group, the magan,

386
00:17:40.206 --> 00:17:41.315
all the group...

387
00:17:41.315 --> 00:17:42.297
<v Man>The circle.</v>

388
00:17:42.297 --> 00:17:43.384
<v ->Circle?</v>

389
00:17:43.384 --> 00:17:44.152
Circle?

390
00:17:44.152 --> 00:17:45.379
<v Regina>Yeah, circle.</v>

391
00:17:45.379 --> 00:17:46.446
And I am here--

392
00:17:46.446 --> 00:17:47.427
<v Regina>In the middle?</v>

393
00:17:47.427 --> 00:17:48.376
<v ->Yes.</v>

394
00:17:48.376 --> 00:17:53.376
And I crying too much,

395
00:17:54.434 --> 00:17:57.244
and I don't know what am saying me.

396
00:17:57.389 --> 00:18:00.540
Am here like this, no, no see me.

397
00:18:01.058 --> 00:18:02.321
Holding a...

398
00:18:03.906 --> 00:18:08.906
Ok, that's all, I am finish this meditation,

399
00:18:09.484 --> 00:18:12.033
I tell Schlomo, "Listen to me.

400
00:18:12.033 --> 00:18:15.024
"I am not going no party, I wait here.

401
00:18:15.681 --> 00:18:17.907
"You, I am not going anyth--

402
00:18:17.907 --> 00:18:19.283
<v Regina>You didn't, weren't going to go do drugs</v>

403
00:18:19.283 --> 00:18:20.371
with your friends?
<v Meir>No, no.</v>

404
00:18:20.371 --> 00:18:22.877
I am, I come in to my friend,

405
00:18:22.877 --> 00:18:27.570
still my girlfriend and my father telling,

406
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.442
you going, you are going to a party,

407
00:18:31.442 --> 00:18:34.017
and I am stay here.

408
00:18:36.039 --> 00:18:39.879
What, are you crazy, meditation, what you want?

409
00:18:39.879 --> 00:18:42.721
No, no, I here, I stay here.

410
00:18:44.049 --> 00:18:49.049
And after this I am going Schlomo Shoham too much,

411
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:52.273
not much but--

412
00:18:52.273 --> 00:18:53.243
<v Regina>A lot, you started</v>

413
00:18:53.243 --> 00:18:54.736
spending more time with Schlomo.

414
00:18:54.736 --> 00:18:55.500
<v ->Yeah.</v>

415
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.148
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

416
00:18:56.148 --> 00:18:57.501
<v ->And they go, "What are you,</v>

417
00:18:57.501 --> 00:18:58.994
"where is Schlomo going?"

418
00:18:58.994 --> 00:18:59.795
I am going.

419
00:18:59.795 --> 00:19:00.775
<v Regina>Right.</v>

420
00:19:00.775 --> 00:19:02.042
<v ->This is first my teacher.</v>

421
00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:03.556
<v Regina>He kind of became your guru of sort,</v>

422
00:19:03.556 --> 00:19:04.527
he was your guru?

423
00:19:04.527 --> 00:19:07.008
<v ->For me, Schlomo is guru, yeah.</v>

424
00:19:07.387 --> 00:19:09.845
Ok, now is my friend.

425
00:19:10.267 --> 00:19:13.307
<v ->The ego loves to said it, I did it for him, but no.</v>

426
00:19:13.307 --> 00:19:17.343
This kind of a healing that he brought to me as well.

427
00:19:17.605 --> 00:19:20.992
So he went in to our group, and then he began to cry,

428
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:25.276
and because, I think, it's the first time in his life he saw

429
00:19:25.276 --> 00:19:26.854
a judge who is human, who can touch you,

430
00:19:26.854 --> 00:19:30.005
you can hug him, he smiles to you, he is open.

431
00:19:30.331 --> 00:19:32.870
He can come close to me, there is no bench there

432
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.674
and all this kind of things that you have in the courtroom.

433
00:19:38.215 --> 00:19:42.205
And, and we became friends since then,

434
00:19:42.205 --> 00:19:45.756
and he has done a great, great job in work.

435
00:19:45.756 --> 00:19:48.711
He left the criminal world,

436
00:19:48.711 --> 00:19:51.862
and he is now teaching meditation himself.

437
00:19:52.008 --> 00:19:54.813
<v Regina>And he's working with the kids,</v>

438
00:19:54.813 --> 00:19:58.205
with the troubled kids that have drug and violence problems.

439
00:19:58.205 --> 00:20:02.584
<v ->So for him, also, kind of his healing is to...</v>

440
00:20:03.282 --> 00:20:05.026
give it to the next generation,

441
00:20:05.026 --> 00:20:07.725
to give it to those guys who, unfortunately, are criminals

442
00:20:07.725 --> 00:20:11.737
and to find a way how to (unintelligible) them,

443
00:20:11.737 --> 00:20:15.982
how to heal them, how to hug them and give them love

444
00:20:15.982 --> 00:20:20.558
and all what he needs so badly and I need so badly.

445
00:20:20.558 --> 00:20:22.446
'Cause you have to know, judge, also,

446
00:20:22.446 --> 00:20:24.383
is a very, very lonely place.

447
00:20:24.655 --> 00:20:27.234
To sit there, most of the time in your life,

448
00:20:27.234 --> 00:20:30.317
you can not even consult with somebody as what to do,

449
00:20:30.317 --> 00:20:31.575
and you send people to jail.

450
00:20:31.575 --> 00:20:34.007
You can not ask somebody, "What I give this guy,

451
00:20:34.007 --> 00:20:35.447
"five years or four years?"

452
00:20:35.447 --> 00:20:37.079
Nobody can help you with this.

453
00:20:37.079 --> 00:20:40.786
And judges also need some support and hug and love,

454
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.785
and when I say it, when I teach judges,

455
00:20:43.973 --> 00:20:46.042
I'm teaching intelligence,

456
00:20:46.042 --> 00:20:48.548
emotional intelligence in the free to flow,

457
00:20:48.548 --> 00:20:50.713
in the judges in Israel here.

458
00:20:50.713 --> 00:20:51.780
<v Regina>Fabulous.</v>

459
00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.124
<v ->Yeah, it's a great thing.</v>

460
00:20:53.124 --> 00:20:55.976
And you see many judges were crying.

461
00:20:56.295 --> 00:20:59.398
And it's amazing, because when they need support,

462
00:20:59.398 --> 00:21:00.892
like we all need support,

463
00:21:00.892 --> 00:21:02.380
we need love like you all need love,

464
00:21:02.962 --> 00:21:05.490
and maybe it's time will come that we will,

465
00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:10.490
we can drop this legal system and be more man to man

466
00:21:10.674 --> 00:21:13.772
and we will not need this to protect us.

467
00:21:14.087 --> 00:21:17.537
I hope time will come when we will be able to do it.

468
00:21:18.215 --> 00:21:22.278
But for the ti-time for now, at least--

469
00:21:22.278 --> 00:21:23.793
<v Regina>It exists.</v>
<v Schlomo>supporting them,</v>

470
00:21:23.793 --> 00:21:25.339
it's very important.

471
00:21:25.339 --> 00:21:29.015
<v Regina>Yes, and so, going back now to the,</v>

472
00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:31.707
the Committee for Future Generations

473
00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:33.150
and what you're doing with this,

474
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:34.569
what is your vision?

475
00:21:34.569 --> 00:21:39.518
Because you appear to be extremely forward thinking

476
00:21:39.518 --> 00:21:42.280
and, in terms of your country,

477
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.531
and not only that, globally.

478
00:21:44.531 --> 00:21:46.269
But what would you like to accomplish

479
00:21:46.269 --> 00:21:50.114
with this chair, position?

480
00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:51.816
<v ->Wow.</v>

481
00:21:56.286 --> 00:21:59.860
The main thing is, based on futurology,

482
00:22:00.677 --> 00:22:03.764
that, if you want to prepare yourself to the future,

483
00:22:05.189 --> 00:22:07.343
it's not enough to do an extrapolation

484
00:22:07.343 --> 00:22:09.289
to see what will be the future.

485
00:22:10.129 --> 00:22:12.529
For sure, we can not do it by extrapolation,

486
00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:15.093
it's very linear, it's very, very superficial.

487
00:22:15.238 --> 00:22:17.659
We can not even do it by all,

488
00:22:17.659 --> 00:22:19.744
creating all the scripts, all the,

489
00:22:21.605 --> 00:22:23.090
how do you say scripts?

490
00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:24.321
All the...

491
00:22:24.465 --> 00:22:25.649
<v Regina>Like a legal ma--</v>

492
00:22:25.649 --> 00:22:26.577
<v ->No, no.</v>

493
00:22:26.577 --> 00:22:27.825
<v Regina>Not a mandate, but a--</v>

494
00:22:27.825 --> 00:22:29.041
<v ->The, what?</v>

495
00:22:29.041 --> 00:22:30.342
<v Regina>Mission, like your missions--</v>

496
00:22:30.342 --> 00:22:31.292
<v ->Like you create all the films</v>

497
00:22:31.292 --> 00:22:32.518
that going to be in the future,

498
00:22:32.518 --> 00:22:33.585
how you say it, all the...

499
00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:34.374
<v Regina>Scripts?</v>

500
00:22:34.374 --> 00:22:35.473
<v ->Scripts?
<v Regina>It is scripts, yes.</v>

501
00:22:35.473 --> 00:22:36.539
Ok, so. (Regina laughs)

502
00:22:36.539 --> 00:22:38.485
By creating all the scripts.

503
00:22:39.739 --> 00:22:43.227
Because, you know, according to the amount of changes

504
00:22:43.227 --> 00:22:45.049
that we are facing now,

505
00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:48.748
almost everything that is reasonable will not happen.

506
00:22:48.988 --> 00:22:52.555
Almost all what will happen, it's not reasonable.

507
00:22:52.636 --> 00:22:55.689
And there's a futurology now, a method called Wild Card,

508
00:22:56.068 --> 00:22:58.020
means that everything that will happen

509
00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.891
is something that you can not predict it.

510
00:23:00.431 --> 00:23:05.220
So we are facing a world of changes in all the fields.

511
00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.019
It's in economy, it's in society, it's in environment...

512
00:23:08.793 --> 00:23:09.817
<v Regina>Technology.</v>

513
00:23:09.817 --> 00:23:11.513
<v ->Technology, sure.</v>

514
00:23:11.513 --> 00:23:16.513
And the main way that I believe,

515
00:23:16.547 --> 00:23:20.243
and I think that this is part also is

516
00:23:20.243 --> 00:23:23.533
in holodynamics is that...

517
00:23:25.725 --> 00:23:29.160
It called backcasting, it's like we can create our future.

518
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.645
We have first to put our visions there,

519
00:23:31.645 --> 00:23:35.943
to prelive our future, to know where are we going,

520
00:23:35.943 --> 00:23:38.785
to decide what is our common vision,

521
00:23:39.005 --> 00:23:40.508
and what is amazing, you know,

522
00:23:40.508 --> 00:23:45.362
that when many people sitting together, it's so similar.

523
00:23:45.362 --> 00:23:47.777
Everybody has his own tune, on one hand,

524
00:23:47.777 --> 00:23:50.982
but other, in the main things, we want the same.

525
00:23:50.982 --> 00:23:53.552
We all want the same, we want a world of love,

526
00:23:53.552 --> 00:23:56.624
a world of acceptance, a world of happiness,

527
00:23:56.624 --> 00:24:00.154
a world of good food, of health, and to

528
00:24:00.154 --> 00:24:01.658
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

529
00:24:01.658 --> 00:24:05.114
So when the main thing that I believe is

530
00:24:05.114 --> 00:24:06.330
that we can create it.

531
00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:09.705
We can create it here in Israel, we can create it globally.

532
00:24:10.138 --> 00:24:14.357
And it's only thing is to be total,

533
00:24:15.174 --> 00:24:18.400
to put your total intention in creating it

534
00:24:18.587 --> 00:24:19.952
and to create a consensus,

535
00:24:19.952 --> 00:24:24.507
to create a, in a way, kind of love together,

536
00:24:24.507 --> 00:24:25.883
harmony together,

537
00:24:25.883 --> 00:24:27.402
with other people, with other...

538
00:24:29.125 --> 00:24:30.778
with other people with other methods,

539
00:24:30.778 --> 00:24:33.001
with other nations, with other...

540
00:24:34.703 --> 00:24:38.846
All the streams that are going toward the future.

541
00:24:39.674 --> 00:24:44.217
<v Regina>And, certainly, the most challenging situation is</v>

542
00:24:44.217 --> 00:24:49.217
at home, here in Israel, is your relationship between

543
00:24:49.262 --> 00:24:51.673
the Palestinians and the Jews.

544
00:24:51.673 --> 00:24:53.347
Certainly this is a big one.

545
00:24:53.347 --> 00:24:56.153
A lot of contention, and, interestingly,

546
00:24:56.153 --> 00:24:59.107
as we've talked to many people on both sides,

547
00:24:59.107 --> 00:25:01.752
common people, people that have shops,

548
00:25:01.752 --> 00:25:04.184
people in the street, just people.

549
00:25:04.184 --> 00:25:07.437
They all say the same thing, without exception.

550
00:25:07.437 --> 00:25:11.149
They say, "We've gotten along before,

551
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:13.095
"we can get along again, this is..."

552
00:25:13.709 --> 00:25:16.589
And the Arabs will say, "I have Jews as my friends,

553
00:25:16.589 --> 00:25:17.954
"they come to my home,"

554
00:25:17.954 --> 00:25:20.162
and Jews will say, "I have Arabs that are friends

555
00:25:20.162 --> 00:25:21.463
"and come to my home."

556
00:25:21.463 --> 00:25:23.340
"It isn't the people, we don't want this.

557
00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.566
"It's the politicians, they want this."

558
00:25:27.084 --> 00:25:29.495
What, how do you respond to that?

559
00:25:29.495 --> 00:25:31.094
<v ->First, I'm really sorry to upset you,</v>

560
00:25:31.094 --> 00:25:33.223
I don't think this is the main problem for Israel.

561
00:25:34.275 --> 00:25:36.242
In a way, we are captive of the drama.

562
00:25:36.856 --> 00:25:39.202
In a way, we are all dealing with this,

563
00:25:39.202 --> 00:25:41.329
what we see, very superficially.

564
00:25:41.869 --> 00:25:43.746
I think many, many other things

565
00:25:43.746 --> 00:25:46.466
are really crucial to the future of Israel,

566
00:25:46.466 --> 00:25:49.625
and we, unfortunately, don't see them even.

567
00:25:49.625 --> 00:25:51.299
We forget them.

568
00:25:51.299 --> 00:25:52.899
And we are captive of the drama,

569
00:25:52.899 --> 00:25:55.144
and this is because of the...

570
00:25:55.939 --> 00:25:57.059
First, because of the media,

571
00:25:57.059 --> 00:25:59.747
'cause the media needs the drama to sell writing,

572
00:25:59.747 --> 00:26:01.069
to sell media.

573
00:26:01.069 --> 00:26:03.132
So, you create a drama.

574
00:26:03.554 --> 00:26:07.618
And what is more dramatic and seems to create,

575
00:26:07.618 --> 00:26:10.754
if you have a fight with two nations,

576
00:26:10.754 --> 00:26:13.079
everybody is sure that he is right,

577
00:26:13.079 --> 00:26:16.183
and then, when they are also killing each other,

578
00:26:16.183 --> 00:26:18.088
it's really great, it's a lot of drama.

579
00:26:18.296 --> 00:26:19.480
<v Regina>Headline news.</v>

580
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.673
<v ->Headline news.</v>

581
00:26:21.113 --> 00:26:22.212
I'll tell you a story.

582
00:26:22.212 --> 00:26:24.712
I'm going to Jerusalem every day,

583
00:26:25.646 --> 00:26:27.432
from my home in Shoham,

584
00:26:28.035 --> 00:26:30.990
in the street, in the road called 443,

585
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:34.877
and this road goes in the Palestinian places.

586
00:26:36.995 --> 00:26:39.277
And all my friends are telling me,

587
00:26:39.277 --> 00:26:42.631
"Are you crazy, it's a dangerous place to go every day.

588
00:26:42.829 --> 00:26:44.380
"They going to kill you."

589
00:26:45.005 --> 00:26:50.005
And what I did, I made a statistic.

590
00:26:50.562 --> 00:26:53.271
How many people are getting killed in the other road,

591
00:26:53.271 --> 00:26:55.020
that goes from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

592
00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.678
Road number One, you know.

593
00:26:57.154 --> 00:27:00.145
Every month, and how people are getting killed in this road.

594
00:27:00.631 --> 00:27:04.097
So that's true that two people, all over the years,

595
00:27:04.097 --> 00:27:07.920
that went through this road, 443, were killed by bullets.

596
00:27:08.327 --> 00:27:11.186
But I can tell you that if I am getting killed,

597
00:27:11.186 --> 00:27:14.248
I don't care what kind of arrow is hitting my head,

598
00:27:14.248 --> 00:27:16.644
if it's a bullet or arrow from a car.

599
00:27:17.044 --> 00:27:19.584
So if I really want to live, I have to go this road,

600
00:27:19.584 --> 00:27:20.951
not the other road.

601
00:27:20.951 --> 00:27:23.788
For this is just show you how we are captive of the drama,

602
00:27:23.788 --> 00:27:26.988
because if you ask me, let's say, all of the people,

603
00:27:26.988 --> 00:27:29.153
many of the people of Israel, it's more dangerous.

604
00:27:29.153 --> 00:27:30.817
And we say, "Yes, it's more than dangerous."

605
00:27:30.817 --> 00:27:32.355
Because they know more about it,

606
00:27:32.355 --> 00:27:34.541
because if somebody is killed because of a bullet,

607
00:27:34.541 --> 00:27:36.100
you see it on the headlines.

608
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.212
If somebody is killed by car accident,

609
00:27:38.212 --> 00:27:39.748
you don't see it at all, or maybe--

610
00:27:39.748 --> 00:27:41.529
<v Regina>What was the number on the other road</v>

611
00:27:41.529 --> 00:27:43.161
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem?

612
00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:43.993
<v ->Enough.</v>

613
00:27:43.993 --> 00:27:44.963
<v Regina>How many people were killed there?</v>

614
00:27:44.963 --> 00:27:48.564
<v ->In Israel, I can tell you, in the terror in the last year,</v>

615
00:27:50.426 --> 00:27:53.067
you will have, I think, were killed in terror,

616
00:27:53.841 --> 00:27:55.573
last year, even less, but...

617
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.558
something around 200 paople the whole year--

618
00:27:59.558 --> 00:28:01.200
<v Regina>On both sides?</v>

619
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.853
<v ->The Israelis.</v>

620
00:28:02.853 --> 00:28:04.016
<v Regina>The Israelis, ok.</v>

621
00:28:04.016 --> 00:28:05.797
<v ->And, on the other hand, almost,</v>

622
00:28:05.797 --> 00:28:09.509
more than 500 people are killed every year by car accidents.

623
00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:12.698
And more than 1,000 people are dying every year

624
00:28:12.698 --> 00:28:15.849
in Tel Aviv region because of air pollution.

625
00:28:16.388 --> 00:28:18.714
So, like if you really want to live,

626
00:28:18.714 --> 00:28:21.022
you have to look at what is really dangerous,

627
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.140
and what is really danger for our future,

628
00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.679
and you can say easily that the air pollution

629
00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:27.769
is more, more dangerous to the Israelis

630
00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:30.014
than all the terror and everything else.

631
00:28:30.297 --> 00:28:31.971
And not only for the Israelis,

632
00:28:31.971 --> 00:28:33.454
because air pollution doesn't know borders.

633
00:28:33.454 --> 00:28:35.067
You know, it goes also to the Palestinians,

634
00:28:35.067 --> 00:28:37.242
and to the, go to Jordan, whatever.

635
00:28:37.242 --> 00:28:40.954
<v Regina>And yet, still, there is a genuine issue</v>

636
00:28:40.954 --> 00:28:42.767
on another level in that the Palestinians

637
00:28:42.767 --> 00:28:44.282
feel they can't move freely
<v Schlomo>Yes, yes.</v>

638
00:28:44.282 --> 00:28:45.765
<v Regina>and they're having</v>

639
00:28:45.765 --> 00:28:47.695
lots of obstacles to daily life.

640
00:28:47.695 --> 00:28:52.485
How does this become addressed and overcome?

641
00:28:52.485 --> 00:28:54.992
<v ->First, I, although all what I said,</v>

642
00:28:54.992 --> 00:28:57.471
it's still a painful world.

643
00:28:58.842 --> 00:29:01.027
And it's true, it's true.

644
00:29:01.201 --> 00:29:02.484
Because if we...

645
00:29:03.543 --> 00:29:06.146
You know, even when you go, in Israel,

646
00:29:06.146 --> 00:29:07.650
parties miflaga.

647
00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:09.734
Miflaga means separating.

648
00:29:10.051 --> 00:29:13.114
So, the party is also creating parts.

649
00:29:13.114 --> 00:29:15.717
So, when you go to politics,

650
00:29:15.717 --> 00:29:17.690
every politician is want to be unique,

651
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:20.335
and to show he is more unique that the others,

652
00:29:20.335 --> 00:29:22.959
and he is so,

653
00:29:22.959 --> 00:29:24.516
people, usually, when they come to politics,

654
00:29:24.516 --> 00:29:25.971
they go to extremes.

655
00:29:26.489 --> 00:29:27.902
The main...

656
00:29:28.463 --> 00:29:30.062
Not the main, but, I think, one of the

657
00:29:31.462 --> 00:29:35.659
greatest shows that you can have in the Israeli parliament,

658
00:29:35.659 --> 00:29:37.697
after the people comes from the plane

659
00:29:37.697 --> 00:29:40.182
and we were fighting each other, shouting,

660
00:29:40.182 --> 00:29:42.624
there is a place that they are eating snakes together,

661
00:29:42.624 --> 00:29:44.320
you know, and hugging each other

662
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.101
and smiling to each other and telling jokes.

663
00:29:46.101 --> 00:29:47.659
Those that were, minute before,

664
00:29:47.659 --> 00:29:50.261
like the greatest enemies in the world,

665
00:29:50.261 --> 00:29:52.074
there is kind of a game that

666
00:29:52.074 --> 00:29:54.506
politicians are playing this game.

667
00:29:54.506 --> 00:29:58.709
And this game, unfortunately, that they're playing,

668
00:29:58.709 --> 00:30:00.757
and they know it's not true,

669
00:30:00.757 --> 00:30:03.423
when you see it day after day,

670
00:30:03.423 --> 00:30:07.231
if you Palestinian or Arab or Israeli Arab or a Jew,

671
00:30:07.231 --> 00:30:10.719
it-it's-it has to do, it does something to you,

672
00:30:10.719 --> 00:30:13.524
to your personality, to your way of thinking.

673
00:30:13.524 --> 00:30:15.572
That's something very, very deep.

674
00:30:15.572 --> 00:30:19.657
And then you become more and more extreme yourself,

675
00:30:19.657 --> 00:30:22.547
and this is the way the politicians are really

676
00:30:22.547 --> 00:30:25.171
creating this suffering, creating this separation,

677
00:30:25.171 --> 00:30:28.147
creating this words.

678
00:30:28.147 --> 00:30:31.245
And, for me, it's easy, it's very easy.

679
00:30:33.021 --> 00:30:36.178
If we can have a magic moment,

680
00:30:36.178 --> 00:30:38.983
I wrote some, sometimes I write a poem about magic moments,

681
00:30:38.983 --> 00:30:42.254
as a commissioner, maybe I'll show you it afterward.

682
00:30:42.836 --> 00:30:44.926
If we can create a magic moment,

683
00:30:44.926 --> 00:30:47.736
that in this magic moment one thing will happen.

684
00:30:47.902 --> 00:30:49.854
The politicians will not disturb us,

685
00:30:49.854 --> 00:30:51.631
to live normally,

686
00:30:52.288 --> 00:30:53.839
it will happen.

687
00:30:53.941 --> 00:30:56.170
And the critical message is there.

688
00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.047
We have to know the critical message is there.

689
00:30:58.047 --> 00:30:59.839
People understands the permits,

690
00:30:59.839 --> 00:31:02.318
and more and more that, although things are...

691
00:31:03.274 --> 00:31:04.694
We're in the end of the peace process,

692
00:31:04.694 --> 00:31:05.920
you have to understand it.

693
00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.896
When I was a child there was no peace with Egypt, Israel.

694
00:31:08.896 --> 00:31:10.560
Jordan, Israel.

695
00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.651
Syria was a real threat in Israel.

696
00:31:12.651 --> 00:31:15.627
Lebanon was a real threat,

697
00:31:15.627 --> 00:31:17.441
and Palestinians, for sure.

698
00:31:17.441 --> 00:31:19.574
And nowadays, you know, there is peace with Egypt.

699
00:31:19.574 --> 00:31:22.571
You can say it's not a hot peace, it's a cold peace,

700
00:31:22.571 --> 00:31:23.894
but it's a peace.

701
00:31:23.894 --> 00:31:26.358
For many, many years, there is peace with Jordan,

702
00:31:26.358 --> 00:31:30.624
Syria is no longer a threat in Israel, Lebanon, also.

703
00:31:30.624 --> 00:31:32.459
Terror will be, some years,

704
00:31:32.459 --> 00:31:34.709
but I see it very clearly,

705
00:31:34.709 --> 00:31:36.320
that we are in the end of a peace process,

706
00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.589
it happens.

707
00:31:37.589 --> 00:31:40.266
And when we will finish the problem with the Palestinians,

708
00:31:40.266 --> 00:31:43.231
and, ok, we will fight about some acres here, acres there,

709
00:31:43.231 --> 00:31:46.090
but it's very clear where going to be,

710
00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:48.340
the border will be, you know.

711
00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:51.807
There are little disputes on the corners, but.

712
00:31:51.807 --> 00:31:54.115
So we are through.

713
00:31:54.985 --> 00:31:56.681
The only thing is,

714
00:31:56.681 --> 00:32:01.044
that usually, before you go to a new dimension,

715
00:32:01.044 --> 00:32:04.275
there is a lot of noise.

716
00:32:04.275 --> 00:32:05.875
So it's like, you know,

717
00:32:05.875 --> 00:32:09.054
there is a true story about the pilots,

718
00:32:09.054 --> 00:32:12.088
when they try to go beyond the...

719
00:32:13.725 --> 00:32:15.784
border of the voice, how you say, the?

720
00:32:15.784 --> 00:32:17.021
<v Man>Sound barrier.</v>

721
00:32:17.021 --> 00:32:18.386
<v ->Sound barrier.
<v Regina>Sound barrier.</v>

722
00:32:18.386 --> 00:32:20.573
<v ->So, they were trying to do it,</v>

723
00:32:20.573 --> 00:32:22.354
and, all they time, when the plane

724
00:32:22.354 --> 00:32:26.866
came to this kind of, this height of peace, to this speed,

725
00:32:26.866 --> 00:32:28.252
it began to shake,

726
00:32:28.252 --> 00:32:29.810
<v Regina>Shake, mm-hmm.</v>
<v Schlomo>and to make like.</v>

727
00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:33.202
So everybody was sure, when we came to this moment,

728
00:32:33.202 --> 00:32:34.955
the plane will crash.

729
00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.873
Until one of the guys work brave enough

730
00:32:37.873 --> 00:32:40.817
and he went through it, then it was silence.

731
00:32:40.817 --> 00:32:44.251
So it's like, before you go to this new dimension,

732
00:32:44.251 --> 00:32:47.089
everything is pushing you back,

733
00:32:47.089 --> 00:32:48.390
pulling you back.

734
00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:51.291
And then, time will come, and it will be easy,

735
00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:54.214
it will be like nothing happened.

736
00:32:54.214 --> 00:32:56.368
And without threat, without efforts,

737
00:32:56.368 --> 00:32:59.141
it will be there, and peace will be here,

738
00:32:59.141 --> 00:33:02.992
and then we'll have a huge, huge work to do,

739
00:33:02.992 --> 00:33:07.034
how to cure the wounds and how to go beyond the hatred,

740
00:33:07.034 --> 00:33:10.191
which will take time to educate a new generation.

741
00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:13.897
But time is very close to begin to do this work.

742
00:33:14.319 --> 00:33:16.839
Because the politician, you know,

743
00:33:17.453 --> 00:33:22.065
they now can create a mess sometimes,

744
00:33:23.021 --> 00:33:25.629
not all of them, some of them,

745
00:33:26.168 --> 00:33:30.548
but the power of peace is stronger than everything else.

746
00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:32.461
<v Regina>The wall's still going up,</v>

747
00:33:32.461 --> 00:33:33.645
it's still being built,

748
00:33:33.645 --> 00:33:35.287
and, at the same time the wall's being built

749
00:33:35.287 --> 00:33:36.524
and the noise is getting louder,

750
00:33:36.524 --> 00:33:39.916
you're seeing that the signs of peace beyond

751
00:33:39.916 --> 00:33:41.633
are truly there.

752
00:33:41.633 --> 00:33:44.087
Am I understanding you correctly in that?

753
00:33:44.087 --> 00:33:46.310
<v ->The noises are not being louder.</v>

754
00:33:46.979 --> 00:33:48.674
I'm living here, I can tell you.

755
00:33:48.674 --> 00:33:49.442
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

756
00:33:49.442 --> 00:33:50.850
This country is not dangerous country,

757
00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:52.013
you have been now a month

758
00:33:52.013 --> 00:33:53.218
and you see.
<v Regina>Oh, no, no, no.</v>

759
00:33:53.218 --> 00:33:54.295
I'm saying that the noise
<v Schlomo>Although, if you</v>

760
00:33:54.295 --> 00:33:55.362
<v Regina>you speak of</v>
<v Schlomo>if you if you look</v>

761
00:33:55.362 --> 00:33:57.005
if you look at the, I think Tim told me

762
00:33:57.005 --> 00:34:00.002
that his family called him and said that,

763
00:34:00.002 --> 00:34:01.879
"It's ok for you, I am not in a danger

764
00:34:01.879 --> 00:34:04.023
"because of the change of the government."

765
00:34:04.023 --> 00:34:05.345
So you are here, you laugh at it,

766
00:34:05.345 --> 00:34:06.807
but when you see it on the TV,

767
00:34:06.807 --> 00:34:08.918
you see, maybe, a little danger there.

768
00:34:08.918 --> 00:34:10.796
So, the noises are not louder.

769
00:34:10.796 --> 00:34:12.400
It just...

770
00:34:13.676 --> 00:34:14.817
I said that something,

771
00:34:14.817 --> 00:34:17.025
maybe the noise is a bit louder before the change,

772
00:34:17.025 --> 00:34:19.062
but, but it, it's already there.

773
00:34:19.062 --> 00:34:19.990
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

774
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:21.014
Terror is a problem.

775
00:34:21.014 --> 00:34:22.752
And terror is built on hatred

776
00:34:22.752 --> 00:34:25.451
and we have huge work on education,

777
00:34:26.201 --> 00:34:28.895
and to really cure this hatred.

778
00:34:28.895 --> 00:34:32.323
And this is right and this is a problem we face.

779
00:34:32.607 --> 00:34:35.209
But the political problem, a war,

780
00:34:35.209 --> 00:34:36.971
there is not a real threat here.

781
00:34:36.971 --> 00:34:38.763
<v Regina>I was saying the wall.</v>

782
00:34:38.763 --> 00:34:40.032
<v ->Yeah, yeah, as to the war.</v>

783
00:34:40.032 --> 00:34:43.818
But the walls, I'm against the wall.

784
00:34:43.818 --> 00:34:45.376
<v Regina>Yeah, they're real, and they're</v>

785
00:34:45.376 --> 00:34:47.445
confining.
<v Schlomo>On the other hand,</v>

786
00:34:47.445 --> 00:34:48.256
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

787
00:34:48.256 --> 00:34:49.482
<v ->you know, when you have two children</v>

788
00:34:49.482 --> 00:34:50.783
and they're fighting together,

789
00:34:50.783 --> 00:34:52.789
so first, you separate them.

790
00:34:52.789 --> 00:34:54.687
And then, you give them time to relax.

791
00:34:54.687 --> 00:34:56.682
And ten you can bring them together again.

792
00:34:56.682 --> 00:34:59.615
So sometimes, I think if we are real,

793
00:34:59.615 --> 00:35:02.303
we have to say to the guys, to the children there,

794
00:35:02.303 --> 00:35:06.046
"Relax for a moment, or a year, or even two years."

795
00:35:06.046 --> 00:35:10.776
And then I sure, I see how this walls are des-

796
00:35:11.241 --> 00:35:13.918
will be destroyed destroyed like we destroyed them in Berlin

797
00:35:13.918 --> 00:35:15.656
or wherever in this world.

798
00:35:15.656 --> 00:35:18.047
I see how we can go down.

799
00:35:18.047 --> 00:35:19.307
It takes time.

800
00:35:19.307 --> 00:35:21.099
Maybe it will take two years,

801
00:35:21.099 --> 00:35:22.582
maybe it will take three years, four years,

802
00:35:22.582 --> 00:35:24.118
but not more than this.

803
00:35:24.118 --> 00:35:25.878
It's not about generations.

804
00:35:25.878 --> 00:35:27.040
We're in the end.

805
00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.437
We have first to relax.

806
00:35:28.437 --> 00:35:30.336
If we will have, as I told you about this, magic moment,

807
00:35:30.336 --> 00:35:33.100
if we will have time, if we can relax,

808
00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.700
not be threatened by the Palestinians,

809
00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.362
and they will be there, not be threatened by us,

810
00:35:38.232 --> 00:35:39.070
it's easy.

811
00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.205
It's easy.

812
00:35:40.205 --> 00:35:42.380
We will relax very, very,

813
00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:45.175
I believe, very strongly on the human beings,

814
00:35:45.175 --> 00:35:48.001
on the way, like it's written in the bible,

815
00:35:48.001 --> 00:35:51.809
on the honest and enlightened way of human beings.

816
00:35:51.809 --> 00:35:55.457
So we just need a little payeth, pace,

817
00:35:55.457 --> 00:35:59.446
a little time, a little space, to really heal ourselves,

818
00:35:59.446 --> 00:36:01.729
and then the love will come again,

819
00:36:01.729 --> 00:36:05.200
and separation will follow the walls.

820
00:36:07.744 --> 00:36:10.667
<v Regina>I'm going to ask you on more question.</v>

821
00:36:10.667 --> 00:36:12.704
I'm going out on a limb on this one.

822
00:36:12.704 --> 00:36:13.610
<v ->Going out?</v>

823
00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:16.090
<v Regina>I'm going out on a limb, it's a big question.</v>

824
00:36:18.261 --> 00:36:19.285
Many people unders
<v Schlomo>Go for it,</v>

825
00:36:19.285 --> 00:36:20.533
feel free.

826
00:36:20.533 --> 00:36:21.365
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

827
00:36:21.365 --> 00:36:25.066
Many people are of the awareness and understanding

828
00:36:25.066 --> 00:36:26.868
that, even beyond the politicians,

829
00:36:26.868 --> 00:36:29.236
there are column families, entities,

830
00:36:29.236 --> 00:36:34.236
powers with loads of influence and money around the globe,

831
00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:37.741
and they're in most countries.

832
00:36:37.741 --> 00:36:39.575
There are these families that pull the strings,

833
00:36:39.575 --> 00:36:42.295
manipulate the markets, manipulate the politicians,

834
00:36:42.295 --> 00:36:43.479
and basically say,

835
00:36:43.479 --> 00:36:46.220
"This is how it's going to be next, guys."

836
00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:49.420
There are different names for these families.

837
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:57.218
I'm, like you, seeing that there is a time coming

838
00:36:57.218 --> 00:37:00.369
where there is going to be a shift.

839
00:37:00.813 --> 00:37:04.710
What does it take to...

840
00:37:06.572 --> 00:37:09.314
I can't say wrest or massage power

841
00:37:09.314 --> 00:37:12.353
away from those who hold the resources,

842
00:37:12.353 --> 00:37:15.020
the banking industry, the money, the power.

843
00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.703
There's no indication these people, these entities,

844
00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:21.321
are going to give this up voluntarily.

845
00:37:21.956 --> 00:37:23.929
And yet, as long as they have it,

846
00:37:23.929 --> 00:37:28.174
the idea is of domination and hoarding.

847
00:37:28.174 --> 00:37:31.998
It's a greed, and it's a fear-based type of mentality.

848
00:37:33.518 --> 00:37:38.232
How do you get the resources to flow

849
00:37:38.232 --> 00:37:42.984
out of those hands into the rest of the hands?

850
00:37:44.451 --> 00:37:47.032
<v ->First, I'm very sorry I have to answer it in English,</v>

851
00:37:47.032 --> 00:37:49.852
it's not so easy to me but I'll do it.

852
00:37:51.928 --> 00:37:53.790
Yeah, you hit the point.

853
00:37:56.302 --> 00:37:58.926
All what I said before was how to go beyond the fear,

854
00:37:58.926 --> 00:38:00.153
beyond anxiety,

855
00:38:00.153 --> 00:38:03.353
but I have to admit, looking forward, globally,

856
00:38:03.353 --> 00:38:08.163
I've been now invited by the President of Germany,

857
00:38:08.163 --> 00:38:09.443
and I went there and I talk,

858
00:38:09.443 --> 00:38:11.687
was talking about what you asked me now,

859
00:38:13.251 --> 00:38:15.544
about how to create a transformation in the world

860
00:38:15.544 --> 00:38:17.052
in these terms.

861
00:38:19.053 --> 00:38:22.957
Yes, for me, it's looking for the future,

862
00:38:22.957 --> 00:38:26.157
it's more close to fear, anxiety,

863
00:38:26.157 --> 00:38:28.876
the closest to fear anxiety is

864
00:38:28.876 --> 00:38:31.612
topics that you are talking about.

865
00:38:33.175 --> 00:38:35.212
Because this is the way of threating the world,

866
00:38:35.212 --> 00:38:36.865
not, even not the terror.

867
00:38:36.865 --> 00:38:38.840
<v Regina>Yeah, it is the threat, yes.</v>

868
00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.768
<v ->This what I see there, the threat,</v>

869
00:38:41.265 --> 00:38:44.774
And it based on fear, and it based on greed,

870
00:38:44.774 --> 00:38:48.272
and it based on kind of a black hole

871
00:38:48.272 --> 00:38:50.800
in the personalities of the whole world

872
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.098
of kind of a passion, not a positive passion.

873
00:38:55.098 --> 00:38:56.954
A passion that, in this black hole,

874
00:38:56.954 --> 00:39:00.677
the more you put in, the more black is the hole.

875
00:39:00.677 --> 00:39:02.511
The more money, the more food,

876
00:39:02.511 --> 00:39:04.826
the more whatever you put there,

877
00:39:04.826 --> 00:39:09.278
and the globalization is a typical...

878
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:15.513
typical direction,

879
00:39:15.513 --> 00:39:18.590
typical flow that the world is going through.

880
00:39:24.728 --> 00:39:28.910
And what I know that the same way

881
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:31.021
that we have to deal with the threats,

882
00:39:31.021 --> 00:39:33.842
in terror, in war, in everything,

883
00:39:34.317 --> 00:39:36.956
is the same that we have to deal with here.

884
00:39:37.474 --> 00:39:41.233
So first, we have to be able to accept it.

885
00:39:41.858 --> 00:39:44.301
Accept means not to say it's ok,

886
00:39:44.301 --> 00:39:46.252
but to look at it and to say,

887
00:39:46.252 --> 00:39:49.009
first we have to be aware what is the situation.

888
00:39:49.762 --> 00:39:52.049
This is the situation, it's not accepted,

889
00:39:52.193 --> 00:39:53.958
it's to know this is the situation.

890
00:39:54.327 --> 00:39:56.950
And when we know that there's a situation,

891
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:59.664
and we're really aware of what's going on,

892
00:40:00.502 --> 00:40:02.331
by fighting those guys,

893
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:03.749
we will lose.

894
00:40:04.289 --> 00:40:08.747
We can not fight, we can not put a war against them,

895
00:40:08.747 --> 00:40:11.600
because we create not a war, and they're stronger than us.

896
00:40:12.299 --> 00:40:15.898
They are really control huge part of the world.

897
00:40:17.067 --> 00:40:18.752
And I say those guys is stereotype,

898
00:40:18.752 --> 00:40:20.747
but it has to go through the countries.

899
00:40:20.747 --> 00:40:22.078
<v Regina>Right.</v>

900
00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:24.222
So what I'm doing here in this country,

901
00:40:24.367 --> 00:40:26.201
and we, as the Commissioner of Future Generations, we,

902
00:40:26.201 --> 00:40:29.160
I'm dealing with those guys a lot,

903
00:40:29.657 --> 00:40:31.118
we're dealing with the open spaces,

904
00:40:31.118 --> 00:40:33.230
we want to preserve the open spaces

905
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:35.299
and we dealing with the people from the union state,

906
00:40:35.299 --> 00:40:36.718
they have a lot of money.

907
00:40:36.718 --> 00:40:38.755
We don't want them to be on the seashores,

908
00:40:38.755 --> 00:40:40.387
so we fight with them.

909
00:40:40.387 --> 00:40:42.616
Fight, don't fight, but we have to deal with.

910
00:40:42.616 --> 00:40:45.060
We deal with the people from the food industry,

911
00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:49.929
because we don't want them to sell poison to our children.

912
00:40:50.009 --> 00:40:52.207
Real poison, like Coca-Cola,

913
00:40:52.207 --> 00:40:56.366
they create the whole world addiction to sugar.

914
00:40:56.366 --> 00:40:58.965
43% of the Coca-Cola,

915
00:40:59.248 --> 00:41:01.957
so at 34% of Coca-Cola is sugar now,

916
00:41:01.957 --> 00:41:03.466
and they're creating addiction.

917
00:41:03.611 --> 00:41:05.072
And we are now going against them,

918
00:41:05.072 --> 00:41:08.282
we said that will not be permitted to publish

919
00:41:08.282 --> 00:41:13.282
and to advertise all those advertisement

920
00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:17.263
to sell their products before nine o'clock,

921
00:41:17.263 --> 00:41:19.140
so the children, at least, will not see it.

922
00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.114
And the people from the chocolates, on one hand,

923
00:41:21.114 --> 00:41:24.229
on the other hand is the people from

924
00:41:24.229 --> 00:41:26.373
the electrochemical industries,

925
00:41:26.373 --> 00:41:28.272
that they are putting a huge pollution is Israel,

926
00:41:28.272 --> 00:41:30.795
you know, especially north of Israel, you know.

927
00:41:31.249 --> 00:41:35.286
So, everywhere I go, I see these people.

928
00:41:35.964 --> 00:41:40.964
So what I realized that the only way is to

929
00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.077
see those people as human beings.

930
00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.800
To be able to look at their eyes,

931
00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.688
to talk to them as men to men,

932
00:41:48.688 --> 00:41:50.405
although they are people very rich,

933
00:41:50.405 --> 00:41:51.728
and usually what I say to them are,

934
00:41:51.728 --> 00:41:56.442
"Listen, I know that you have now apartment to your son,

935
00:41:56.442 --> 00:41:58.693
"and grandson, and grand-grand-grandson.

936
00:41:58.693 --> 00:42:02.362
"Don't you think that you should really

937
00:42:02.362 --> 00:42:03.962
"take care of your grand-grand-grandson

938
00:42:03.962 --> 00:42:06.308
"and really be sure that you're going to have

939
00:42:06.308 --> 00:42:11.308
"enough air to breath or clean water to drink, etcetera?"

940
00:42:12.804 --> 00:42:16.238
Or when I'm telling them about their children already,

941
00:42:16.238 --> 00:42:18.681
that they are now creating addiction

942
00:42:18.681 --> 00:42:21.416
to their children, etcetera.

943
00:42:22.585 --> 00:42:26.734
And I realized that there is a possibility

944
00:42:26.734 --> 00:42:30.749
to create awareness in those tycoons' hearts.

945
00:42:30.968 --> 00:42:32.589
They're human beings.

946
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:35.657
Everybody in this world who needs so much money

947
00:42:36.292 --> 00:42:40.794
has a huge, huge hole in his spirit.

948
00:42:40.794 --> 00:42:42.927
Otherwise you don't need so much money.

949
00:42:42.927 --> 00:42:47.365
It's like, you know, how much, as big ego as you have,

950
00:42:47.365 --> 00:42:49.263
you don't need so much money.

951
00:42:49.263 --> 00:42:51.844
It's like, in the beginning you say it,

952
00:42:51.844 --> 00:42:53.028
it's like with the politicians,

953
00:42:53.028 --> 00:42:54.884
you say, "I going to be a member of a parliament,

954
00:42:54.884 --> 00:42:56.304
"then I going to be happy."

955
00:42:56.304 --> 00:42:57.552
And then you are there, and then you say,

956
00:42:57.552 --> 00:42:58.736
"No, no, I'm not happy.

957
00:42:58.736 --> 00:43:01.274
"So maybe I going to be a vice-minister.

958
00:43:01.274 --> 00:43:02.405
"I going to be happy."

959
00:43:02.405 --> 00:43:04.538
And you getting to be vice-minister,

960
00:43:04.538 --> 00:43:06.607
and then you say, "I'm not happy."

961
00:43:06.607 --> 00:43:09.210
Then you say, "I'll be minister, or Prime Minister."

962
00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:11.322
And these are, we have some Prime Ministers a day,

963
00:43:11.322 --> 00:43:14.673
even when they will be President of the World,

964
00:43:14.673 --> 00:43:16.433
they will not be happy.

965
00:43:16.433 --> 00:43:18.950
And you can see those people, the vicious people.

966
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:22.704
So there is something in their personality that needs love.

967
00:43:22.704 --> 00:43:24.422
And the main thing is

968
00:43:24.422 --> 00:43:27.327
that they don't know that they are lovable the way they are.

969
00:43:28.144 --> 00:43:30.714
Like this is, I think, the main thing

970
00:43:30.714 --> 00:43:33.311
that the whole world is going through.

971
00:43:33.808 --> 00:43:36.731
If you know that you are lovable the way you are,

972
00:43:36.731 --> 00:43:38.640
and I know that I'm lovable the way I am,

973
00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.884
we can relax.

974
00:43:40.359 --> 00:43:42.209
We can enjoy life.

975
00:43:42.866 --> 00:43:45.698
Ok, money is not bad thing, it's an energy.

976
00:43:46.142 --> 00:43:47.927
And you love money, it's ok.

977
00:43:48.211 --> 00:43:50.600
But then, I won't be a chazzer.

978
00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:51.645
You know what chazzer is?

979
00:43:51.645 --> 00:43:52.829
<v Regina>Uh-uh.</v>

980
00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:54.365
Like a pig, I want more and more and more

981
00:43:54.365 --> 00:43:55.368
and more and more.
<v Regina>Oh, yes,</v>

982
00:43:55.368 --> 00:43:56.317
pig, mm-hmm.
<v Schlomo>These, I will say,</v>

983
00:43:56.317 --> 00:43:58.311
like, those people you know,

984
00:43:58.311 --> 00:43:59.847
they say we squeeze the lemon,

985
00:43:59.847 --> 00:44:02.589
you know, it's like, it's really horrible.

986
00:44:02.589 --> 00:44:04.583
And you don't need so much.

987
00:44:04.583 --> 00:44:06.972
It's like you really don't need so much.

988
00:44:06.972 --> 00:44:10.801
And when you don't need any control on other people,

989
00:44:10.801 --> 00:44:14.023
and you don't need money for controlling other people,

990
00:44:14.428 --> 00:44:18.083
then you can become humble, modest, and say,

991
00:44:18.083 --> 00:44:19.522
"Ok, it's enough."

992
00:44:19.522 --> 00:44:22.281
And I know, and also, in the workshops I lead,

993
00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.441
when people really come to understand

994
00:44:24.441 --> 00:44:26.088
that they are lovable the way they are,

995
00:44:27.556 --> 00:44:30.547
then vicious goes down rapidly.

996
00:44:30.894 --> 00:44:33.475
It's like you don't need, if it's ok,

997
00:44:33.475 --> 00:44:35.192
if you're ok like the way you are,

998
00:44:35.192 --> 00:44:37.070
and you have enough food to eat and to drink,

999
00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:38.840
and you have them in your car or something,

1000
00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.227
you don't need any more.

1001
00:44:40.227 --> 00:44:42.968
And it's easy to understand it,

1002
00:44:42.968 --> 00:44:44.576
and I think this is the only way,

1003
00:44:45.158 --> 00:44:48.432
by really spreading love to really hand the world

1004
00:44:48.432 --> 00:44:51.888
from all this problem of the tycoons.

1005
00:44:51.888 --> 00:44:53.424
Was a long answer, what?

1006
00:44:53.424 --> 00:44:55.098
<v Regina>No, that's a, was a big question,</v>

1007
00:44:55.098 --> 00:44:56.677
so I expected a long answer.

1008
00:44:56.677 --> 00:44:59.322
<v ->I think this is the point.</v>

1009
00:44:59.322 --> 00:45:02.127
It's like the more love we're going to spread,

1010
00:45:02.127 --> 00:45:04.585
the more people will be, will rest,

1011
00:45:05.028 --> 00:45:08.516
will be less dominant, less controlling,

1012
00:45:08.516 --> 00:45:11.155
and more open to accept themselves.

1013
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.092
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1014
00:45:16.092 --> 00:45:19.505
And so do you see this in the sense, almost,

1015
00:45:19.505 --> 00:45:24.234
in the sense of the unified field of consciousness?

1016
00:45:24.432 --> 00:45:28.912
Where the more people, the more critical mass of people

1017
00:45:28.912 --> 00:45:31.365
can flow into this place of knowledge

1018
00:45:31.365 --> 00:45:34.298
and acceptance of the situation,

1019
00:45:34.298 --> 00:45:39.077
and be able to perpetuate love in the face of that,

1020
00:45:39.077 --> 00:45:41.242
that, ultimately, this will seep into

1021
00:45:41.242 --> 00:45:43.119
the consciousness of the people

1022
00:45:43.119 --> 00:45:45.999
that are holding onto the assets

1023
00:45:45.999 --> 00:45:47.364
of the world?
<v Schlomo>I knew when</v>

1024
00:45:47.364 --> 00:45:49.391
there was a war with Iraq,

1025
00:45:49.391 --> 00:45:51.823
my son asked me, "Listen,

1026
00:45:51.823 --> 00:45:54.632
"do you love me more than my sister?"

1027
00:45:54.798 --> 00:45:58.323
And I said, "There is no more or less in love."

1028
00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:00.718
You know, like the typical answer for it.

1029
00:46:00.718 --> 00:46:01.806
And he said, "Ok, now,

1030
00:46:01.806 --> 00:46:03.709
"you love me more than Saddam Hussein?"

1031
00:46:04.227 --> 00:46:05.426
from Iraq.

1032
00:46:05.891 --> 00:46:07.054
And I told him, "Listen,

1033
00:46:07.054 --> 00:46:09.198
"I am sure that if the mother of Saddam Hussein

1034
00:46:09.198 --> 00:46:11.348
"would have given him enough love,

1035
00:46:11.951 --> 00:46:15.753
"the whole world could save some of the wars."

1036
00:46:15.855 --> 00:46:18.796
And also the mother of George Bush, you know, and...

1037
00:46:19.225 --> 00:46:23.292
So, some, it's typical, you can see it.

1038
00:46:23.292 --> 00:46:25.319
I'm, I working with the politicians, you know,

1039
00:46:25.319 --> 00:46:28.124
Prime Minister, Minister, I see it daily.

1040
00:46:31.214 --> 00:46:34.056
You can see that if they could have understand

1041
00:46:34.056 --> 00:46:35.730
that they are lovable the way they are,

1042
00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:37.245
the whole scene was different.

1043
00:46:37.245 --> 00:46:38.802
The whole scene was different.

1044
00:46:38.802 --> 00:46:40.993
They could have come to work relaxed.

1045
00:46:41.191 --> 00:46:42.418
They could have come to say, "Ok,

1046
00:46:42.418 --> 00:46:45.628
"we love ourselves, it's ok, I don't need any other laws,

1047
00:46:45.628 --> 00:46:48.753
or any other wars, or any other whatever,

1048
00:46:48.753 --> 00:46:50.193
"to be more lovable.

1049
00:46:50.193 --> 00:46:53.702
"And this, in a way, will not give me more love anyway.

1050
00:46:53.702 --> 00:46:58.702
"So let's relax, let's try to enjoy life, to celebrate."

1051
00:47:01.158 --> 00:47:04.781
Not to, there's on guy, Trun Soo said in the east,

1052
00:47:05.299 --> 00:47:08.845
"There are the gold seekers, and the people who celebrate."

1053
00:47:09.662 --> 00:47:13.523
So, gold seeking, especially in this country,

1054
00:47:13.523 --> 00:47:17.207
is a huge, huge, sickness, it's a very big sickness.

1055
00:47:18.066 --> 00:47:19.692
Gold-seeking.

1056
00:47:19.741 --> 00:47:22.599
<v Regina>And so, for you, what's next for you?</v>

1057
00:47:22.599 --> 00:47:25.239
Continue with Future Generations?

1058
00:47:26.013 --> 00:47:27.425
<v ->I don't know.</v>

1059
00:47:27.538 --> 00:47:31.996
I had a zen master, teacher, he gave me his book,

1060
00:47:31.996 --> 00:47:33.901
the name of book was Only Don't Know.

1061
00:47:34.314 --> 00:47:38.442
So, I still don't know why I going to,

1062
00:47:38.442 --> 00:47:41.273
what I going to do when I going to be grown up.

1063
00:47:42.761 --> 00:47:44.340
<v ->We're going to be following Schlomo's work</v>

1064
00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:45.919
in the Knesset in the future

1065
00:47:45.919 --> 00:47:48.169
and hope to interview him again at a later date.

1066
00:47:48.169 --> 00:47:50.865
Until next time, thanks for watching.
