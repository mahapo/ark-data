1
00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:03.466
<v ->It would take nearly as long as the interview itself</v>

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:06.863
to give you a complete bio on this interviewee.

3
00:00:06.863 --> 00:00:10.183
In short, DaVid is a visionary, a medical doctor,

4
00:00:10.183 --> 00:00:12.471
an artist and has founded a health based

5
00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:15.491
political party called the Light Party.

6
00:00:15.491 --> 00:00:17.512
As director of the San Francisco medical research

7
00:00:17.512 --> 00:00:21.132
foundation, DaVid turns to natural healing modalities,

8
00:00:21.132 --> 00:00:24.272
as well as the more subtle, such as light and sound.

9
00:00:24.272 --> 00:00:26.051
A position that's difficult for most

10
00:00:26.051 --> 00:00:28.492
mainstream doctors to access.

11
00:00:28.492 --> 00:00:32.742 line:15% 
(gentle music)

12
00:00:35.532 --> 00:00:37.008
So you're a medical doctor who has taken

13
00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:39.349
departure from the traditional paths

14
00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:41.568
and you focus on holistic medicine,

15
00:00:41.568 --> 00:00:43.449
but also far beyond that.

16
00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.409
Can you give me a little idea of what the turning

17
00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.498
point was for you after medical school.

18
00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:50.409
<v ->Oh, well I think the initial</v>

19
00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:51.969
turning point was winding up in

20
00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.908
California in San Francisco at the post Haight-Ashbury days,

21
00:00:55.908 --> 00:01:00.908
and I wound up just open and met this

22
00:01:01.588 --> 00:01:03.729
extraordinary woman named Aila

23
00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.183
and I got initiated into all kinds of

24
00:01:07.183 --> 00:01:09.623
new ideas on a very powerful level.

25
00:01:09.623 --> 00:01:13.850
And I was, in my process I had

26
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.260
gone, I was doing a psychiatric residency in,

27
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.740
at Langley Porter and I was very upset about the system.

28
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.920
At the time I was already, I always used to say I was a

29
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.460
Naturopath involved in an Allopathic world.

30
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.579
So I wrote a book at the time called Medicine Today

31
00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.459
Healing Tomorrow, which was a heavy critique,

32
00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:33.460
criticizing the Allopathic model,

33
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.099
because I also became aware and started

34
00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:37.740
studying hypnosis and I was introduced into

35
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.420
Cabalistic teachings and began to understand the

36
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.959
spiritual, mental, emotional, and biological.

37
00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:44.337
<v Interviewer>Connection maybe?</v>

38
00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:46.512
<v ->Yeah, a really deep level, and understood</v>

39
00:01:46.512 --> 00:01:49.193
also that consciousness is the

40
00:01:49.193 --> 00:01:53.282
predetermined energy of creation.

41
00:01:54.753 --> 00:01:57.112
So I was going through this tremendous change

42
00:01:57.112 --> 00:01:59.493
in opening and to awareness on many, many levels.

43
00:01:59.493 --> 00:02:01.693
So I had written this book and I was

44
00:02:01.693 --> 00:02:04.792
at Langley Porter, and I was like, you know,

45
00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:06.593
you might say a hippie, and here we are in this

46
00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:09.453
very prestigious institution, Langley Porter,

47
00:02:09.453 --> 00:02:14.113
with no air and no lighting and bars holding

48
00:02:14.113 --> 00:02:17.073
these deeply disturbed people in these,

49
00:02:17.073 --> 00:02:18.933
you know, it's like a prison.

50
00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:20.673
And I was saying let's get people out into

51
00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:23.173
Golden Gate Park and go out into nature and be in the sun,

52
00:02:23.173 --> 00:02:25.453
and of course they thought, I was, you know,

53
00:02:25.453 --> 00:02:27.753
off the deep end, and I realized I knew what I knew

54
00:02:27.753 --> 00:02:31.072
and I knew that I just couldn't be in the system anymore.

55
00:02:31.072 --> 00:02:33.597
And I wasn't willing to keep my mouth shut.

56
00:02:33.597 --> 00:02:35.237
I was quite, you know, rebellious.

57
00:02:35.237 --> 00:02:38.338
<v Woman>What an idea, radical idea, a little</v>

58
00:02:38.338 --> 00:02:40.737
fresh air, and sunshine.
<v ->Yeah nature, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

59
00:02:40.737 --> 00:02:42.198
I talked about it in my book, I talked about

60
00:02:42.198 --> 00:02:43.777
hospitals versus healing centers.

61
00:02:43.777 --> 00:02:45.177
It's just basic common sense,

62
00:02:45.177 --> 00:02:48.538
so I wrote this book in a fortuitous way,

63
00:02:48.538 --> 00:02:50.978
this foundation literally wound up in my hands,

64
00:02:50.978 --> 00:02:52.718
'cause there was a revolution going on here

65
00:02:52.718 --> 00:02:55.077
in the bay area, there was a great time

66
00:02:55.077 --> 00:02:57.678
of great exploration and um...

67
00:02:57.678 --> 00:02:59.518
I wound up becoming medical director of

68
00:02:59.518 --> 00:03:01.918
San Francisco Medical Research Foundation,

69
00:03:01.918 --> 00:03:03.658
and it was set up in a very open-ended way.

70
00:03:03.658 --> 00:03:05.537
The same time I was really beginning to tap

71
00:03:05.537 --> 00:03:08.257
into my creative artistic self.

72
00:03:08.257 --> 00:03:10.337
And a lot of what San Francisco Medical is to

73
00:03:10.337 --> 00:03:13.377
reintroduce holistic principles also the use of

74
00:03:13.377 --> 00:03:15.678
sound and light through healing and transformation.

75
00:03:15.678 --> 00:03:18.777
Now at the time I was talking about nutrition

76
00:03:18.777 --> 00:03:21.037
and chiropractic and acupuncture, all these things

77
00:03:21.037 --> 00:03:23.218
that were considered to be--

78
00:03:23.218 --> 00:03:24.217
<v Interviewer>Fringe to--</v>

79
00:03:24.217 --> 00:03:26.493
<v ->Fringe, you know, and I also understood</v>

80
00:03:26.493 --> 00:03:28.913
the allopathic model was a monolithic model,

81
00:03:28.913 --> 00:03:30.194
it's like energy.

82
00:03:30.194 --> 00:03:31.773
You know we got all these other alternatives, right?

83
00:03:31.773 --> 00:03:32.593
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

84
00:03:32.593 --> 00:03:33.490
<v ->We got all these other, and yet,</v>

85
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.503
this is the only way, this is the way,

86
00:03:36.503 --> 00:03:38.162
this is the light, this is the truth.

87
00:03:38.162 --> 00:03:40.063
And I knew that it was very myopic.

88
00:03:40.063 --> 00:03:41.002
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

89
00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:42.083
<v ->And so that was sort of,</v>

90
00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:43.922
you know I guess my inclinational agreement

91
00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:47.878
was to be a spokesperson for the holistic health

92
00:03:47.878 --> 00:03:50.339
education, and as things turned around,

93
00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:51.999
we started actually the whole life expos,

94
00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:55.358
we were the initiating for it, and it was a great time--

95
00:03:55.358 --> 00:03:56.898
<v Interviewer>Good job, by the way.</v>

96
00:03:56.898 --> 00:03:58.239
<v ->It was a great time, we were young,</v>

97
00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.658
and we were idealistic and we were bringing

98
00:04:00.658 --> 00:04:02.379
artists together, we came up with the first new age

99
00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:03.354
music catalog--

100
00:04:03.354 --> 00:04:04.431
<v Interviewer>Oh, those were so exciting when they</v>

101
00:04:04.431 --> 00:04:07.211
first came out, it was just fabulous.

102
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:08.571
<v ->Yeah, so I was in Marine County,</v>

103
00:04:08.571 --> 00:04:10.150
it was a very free open time,

104
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.951
and it was just a great time.

105
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.490
And this is pre-computer age.

106
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.950
But as things turned out, I realized that

107
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.380
in terms of health, that a lot of the diseases

108
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.570
I already began to see that we're heading towards a,

109
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.185
I was always ahead of myself but you always said

110
00:04:24.185 --> 00:04:25.807
DaVid was always, at that time it was Raphael.

111
00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:26.947
<v Interviewer>You just were a visionary.</v>

112
00:04:26.947 --> 00:04:27.948
<v ->Yeah, way ahead of myself</v>

113
00:04:27.948 --> 00:04:30.086
that we're heading into an environmental crisis.

114
00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:33.866
And this is the late 70s, we're already doing festivals

115
00:04:33.866 --> 00:04:38.536
with solar energy panels, and having stages...

116
00:04:39.667 --> 00:04:41.427
This was the time Reagan had taken over

117
00:04:41.427 --> 00:04:42.926
and then it was the buildup of Star Wars

118
00:04:42.926 --> 00:04:45.106
and all this, you know the military industrial complex

119
00:04:45.106 --> 00:04:46.786
was still in full force,

120
00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.566
and that's what we're still seeing today

121
00:04:48.566 --> 00:04:51.555
a military budget of 500 billion dollars.

122
00:04:52.326 --> 00:04:55.825
So I started a party, a lot of what I had to say

123
00:04:55.825 --> 00:04:57.446
about holistic health

124
00:04:57.446 --> 00:05:00.506
went into the mainstream, so I realized

125
00:05:00.506 --> 00:05:02.626
that I didn't really have to talk about nutrition anymore

126
00:05:02.626 --> 00:05:04.046
and I didn't have to talk about these things,

127
00:05:04.046 --> 00:05:06.906
because there was a tremendous momentum created.

128
00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:09.106
So I was sort of done on that level

129
00:05:09.106 --> 00:05:11.105
so what's next, so I started a new party

130
00:05:11.105 --> 00:05:12.945
called the Human Ecology Party.

131
00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:16.446
Which the whole idea of basically human ecology

132
00:05:16.446 --> 00:05:19.786
how to detoxify the body, understanding the relationship

133
00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:22.807
between biology, consciousness, and manifestation.

134
00:05:22.807 --> 00:05:26.107
That realizing that on an individual collective level

135
00:05:26.107 --> 00:05:29.026
we're all co-creating this reality.

136
00:05:29.026 --> 00:05:31.806
However you want to define it to be.

137
00:05:31.806 --> 00:05:34.846
So I realized understanding the laws and principles

138
00:05:34.846 --> 00:05:36.946
for medic science that what we focus on

139
00:05:36.946 --> 00:05:38.367
is what we create.

140
00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:40.786
And of course the problem from a Buddhist perspective

141
00:05:40.786 --> 00:05:43.006
is that sounds simple, but our minds have been

142
00:05:43.006 --> 00:05:44.245
heavily conditioned.

143
00:05:44.245 --> 00:05:45.345
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

144
00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.886
<v ->And so we don't really even know our own minds,</v>

145
00:05:46.886 --> 00:05:48.286
I mean we think we do.

146
00:05:48.286 --> 00:05:49.986
So a lot of the work was realizing

147
00:05:49.986 --> 00:05:52.066
I had to heal and transform my own consciousness

148
00:05:52.066 --> 00:05:54.386
and realize I was in my own alchemical process.

149
00:05:54.386 --> 00:05:56.306
My teacher said to me way back, he says,

150
00:05:56.306 --> 00:05:58.086
"Look, pretend you're God,

151
00:05:58.086 --> 00:06:01.626
"and create the world that you wanna create."

152
00:06:01.626 --> 00:06:03.786
But I knew he meant it seriously, and no--

153
00:06:03.786 --> 00:06:04.846
<v Interviewer>Wisdom.</v>

154
00:06:04.846 --> 00:06:06.586
<v ->And know that the universe</v>

155
00:06:06.586 --> 00:06:09.107
is ready, willing, and able to deliver the goods.

156
00:06:09.107 --> 00:06:11.346
You know it's like the divine Mia Isis,

157
00:06:11.346 --> 00:06:13.966
so you're the programmer, you're the Hermes

158
00:06:13.966 --> 00:06:15.306
you write down the script, you write down

159
00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:17.266
the constitution, what do you really want?

160
00:06:17.266 --> 00:06:19.265
So I basically worked from first principle,

161
00:06:19.265 --> 00:06:21.666
so it's back to clean water, clean air,

162
00:06:21.666 --> 00:06:23.946
creating a culture where we can actually have time

163
00:06:23.946 --> 00:06:26.706
for ourselves, and put a major emphasis on

164
00:06:26.706 --> 00:06:29.946
planetary stewardship, this is the early 80s.

165
00:06:29.946 --> 00:06:32.706
Which is very much Native American indigenous thought,

166
00:06:32.706 --> 00:06:33.727
but at that time, you know,

167
00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:34.986
"What's this guy talking about?"

168
00:06:34.986 --> 00:06:37.268
Piece of the crisis, the rubber hadn't hit the road yet--

169
00:06:37.268 --> 00:06:38.287
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

170
00:06:38.287 --> 00:06:39.007
<v ->Per say.</v>

171
00:06:39.007 --> 00:06:41.007
So I started the Human Ecology Party,

172
00:06:41.007 --> 00:06:44.207
and then it morphed into the Yes Party,

173
00:06:44.207 --> 00:06:47.006
I ran for president in '92.

174
00:06:48.066 --> 00:06:49.686
And it was amazing, we got 800 votes

175
00:06:49.686 --> 00:06:52.345
write in votes, but my purpose of actually doing this

176
00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:54.966
was to be able to go into New England,

177
00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:57.925
and just disseminate tons of information.

178
00:06:57.925 --> 00:07:00.926
The major focus on holistic health education,

179
00:07:00.926 --> 00:07:03.366
single pair, planning a universal healthcare,

180
00:07:03.366 --> 00:07:07.346
and empowering the insurance companies

181
00:07:07.346 --> 00:07:09.546
to support chiropractic, to support

182
00:07:09.546 --> 00:07:12.426
acupuncture, to support hypnotherapy,

183
00:07:12.426 --> 00:07:14.626
to support massage, all the things that,

184
00:07:14.626 --> 00:07:17.325
with the whole premise concept being that

185
00:07:17.325 --> 00:07:19.767
people are healthy, the people are more productive.

186
00:07:19.767 --> 00:07:23.075
I mean basic bottom line principles right?

187
00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:23.810
So I said,

188
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.987
"Is the strength of our nation is directly

189
00:07:27.987 --> 00:07:30.047
"proportionate to the health of the people."
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

190
00:07:30.047 --> 00:07:31.587
<v ->And from that premise, I took it,</v>

191
00:07:31.587 --> 00:07:33.827
the strength of the people is directly proportional

192
00:07:33.827 --> 00:07:35.207
on the health of the soil.

193
00:07:35.207 --> 00:07:37.787
Healthy soil creates healthy plants,

194
00:07:37.787 --> 00:07:39.267
creates healthy people.

195
00:07:39.267 --> 00:07:40.907
So it's basically a restructuring

196
00:07:40.907 --> 00:07:43.007
or bringing to the modern world

197
00:07:43.007 --> 00:07:45.168
the same principles, fire, water, air, and earth.

198
00:07:45.168 --> 00:07:48.307
You know these are the keys, and of course meditation

199
00:07:48.307 --> 00:07:50.964
and stress reduction.

200
00:07:50.964 --> 00:07:53.243
So I built it into a whole political, you know,

201
00:07:53.243 --> 00:07:55.724
party, concept, which to this day

202
00:07:55.724 --> 00:07:59.063
we've got, how many, we've got,

203
00:07:59.063 --> 00:08:01.583
almost 300,000 people on our email list.

204
00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:03.744
We're continually monitoring the best information

205
00:08:03.744 --> 00:08:06.324
in holistic health, the best information on psychological

206
00:08:06.324 --> 00:08:08.543
transformation, the best information on

207
00:08:08.543 --> 00:08:10.910
new energy technology, you name it,

208
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.310
we're a variable encyclopedia of empowering information.

209
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.050
And at the same time, I'm continually working to

210
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.610
work on this great project from the bay area,

211
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.070
which is to convert Alcatraz into

212
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.950
the Global Peace Center.
<v Interviewer>The Global Peace Center.</v>

213
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.210
<v ->Which is a metaphor for the whole</v>

214
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.930
consciousness change, going from a prison mentality

215
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.251
3D, limitation, punishment,

216
00:08:32.251 --> 00:08:35.430
into love, expansion, and freedom.

217
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.489
So it's a metaphor that gets people to think,

218
00:08:37.489 --> 00:08:40.150
'cause politically in this country, in this state

219
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.189
we've got 160,000 people incarcerated,

220
00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:44.489
we've got two million people in jails,

221
00:08:44.489 --> 00:08:47.050
you know very dysfunctional system

222
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.110
based on left-brain thinking.

223
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.669
<v Interviewer>Right, certainly not one that</v>

224
00:08:50.669 --> 00:08:52.909
lends to true rehabilitation on

225
00:08:52.909 --> 00:08:54.049
any meaningful--

226
00:08:54.049 --> 00:08:55.955
<v ->Yeah, compassion, love, forgiveness, you know.</v>

227
00:08:55.955 --> 00:08:57.715
<v Interviewer>Right, right.</v>

228
00:08:57.715 --> 00:08:59.969
It's a beautiful project, just looking at the

229
00:08:59.969 --> 00:09:01.389
artist renderings of it.

230
00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:03.450
You've been actively working on this--

231
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.668
<v ->'78.</v>

232
00:09:04.668 --> 00:09:07.108
We did a festival up in Mount Tam,

233
00:09:07.108 --> 00:09:08.689
up where all these artists, musicians,

234
00:09:08.689 --> 00:09:10.469
and dancers, and poets up on Mount Tam,

235
00:09:10.469 --> 00:09:12.388
and we did this beautiful event.

236
00:09:12.388 --> 00:09:15.049
After it was over, I was with my partner Michael,

237
00:09:15.049 --> 00:09:16.989
we're sitting up overlooking the bay area,

238
00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:18.974
and I had this very very strong vision

239
00:09:18.974 --> 00:09:21.114
of a dome on Alcatraz and I went with it.

240
00:09:21.114 --> 00:09:21.795
<v Interviewer>Yeah.</v>

241
00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:23.395
<v ->I was living in the Redwoods in the Casio</v>

242
00:09:23.395 --> 00:09:25.154
in western Marina and I sat down

243
00:09:25.154 --> 00:09:26.694
and I started writing it out.

244
00:09:26.694 --> 00:09:29.014
'Cause my whole thing is sound and light.

245
00:09:29.014 --> 00:09:29.754
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

246
00:09:29.754 --> 00:09:32.355
<v ->And it was a continuation, so this is like</v>

247
00:09:32.355 --> 00:09:35.335
I know I can go back into past lives,

248
00:09:35.335 --> 00:09:37.455
but we all individually and collectively

249
00:09:37.455 --> 00:09:39.034
were involved in renaissances,

250
00:09:39.034 --> 00:09:41.155
and whenever you have a true renaissance,

251
00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:45.161
you have a new architectural form.

252
00:09:45.161 --> 00:09:46.781
And the domes which represent

253
00:09:46.781 --> 00:09:49.101
spirals, which represent unlimited,

254
00:09:49.101 --> 00:09:51.861
I mean think about what we do with kids in school.

255
00:09:51.861 --> 00:09:54.001
Kids are in boxes.

256
00:09:54.001 --> 00:09:55.500
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>
<v ->That forms the mind,</v>

257
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.001
beginnings and ends, right?

258
00:09:57.001 --> 00:09:58.601
<v Interviewer>In most of the schools, the one thing</v>

259
00:09:58.601 --> 00:10:00.740
I like about the Waldorf Education is that they

260
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.908
try to take some of the box off of it.

261
00:10:02.908 --> 00:10:05.167
<v ->Yeah, because boxes create beginnings and ends.</v>

262
00:10:05.167 --> 00:10:05.968
<v Interviewer>That's right.</v>

263
00:10:05.968 --> 00:10:07.548
<v ->Limitations in the mind.</v>

264
00:10:07.548 --> 00:10:10.028
It impacts into the mind.

265
00:10:10.028 --> 00:10:11.268
<v Interviewer>From the geometry of the room</v>

266
00:10:11.268 --> 00:10:12.548
to the paper in front of you.

267
00:10:12.548 --> 00:10:14.367
<v ->Right, right, so we know that</v>

268
00:10:14.367 --> 00:10:15.988
the consciousness in the universe

269
00:10:15.988 --> 00:10:18.027
is spiraling and it's infinite, and there's no beginning,

270
00:10:18.027 --> 00:10:19.868
and there's no end, it's infinite.

271
00:10:19.868 --> 00:10:20.847
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

272
00:10:20.847 --> 00:10:22.148
<v ->So when you step into a dome</v>

273
00:10:22.148 --> 00:10:24.407
or a cathedral, or you sit out better yet,

274
00:10:24.407 --> 00:10:26.367
just sit out on the beach and look at the ocean.

275
00:10:26.367 --> 00:10:28.087
(laughing)

276
00:10:28.087 --> 00:10:30.167
You realize, "Hey what's going on here?

277
00:10:30.167 --> 00:10:32.448
"There's no limit to any of it."

278
00:10:32.448 --> 00:10:34.767
And yet, individually and collectively we

279
00:10:34.767 --> 00:10:38.187
define the limits, and create structures out of that.

280
00:10:38.187 --> 00:10:40.867
And of course the Aquarian age energies

281
00:10:40.867 --> 00:10:42.427
are coming in and the 2012

282
00:10:42.427 --> 00:10:45.547
is a movement into a higher consciousness where

283
00:10:45.547 --> 00:10:48.986
we really understand infinite unlimitedness,

284
00:10:48.986 --> 00:10:51.266
and not just intellectually or

285
00:10:51.266 --> 00:10:53.226
then it becomes internalized.

286
00:10:53.226 --> 00:10:55.287
That we're fully empowered to realize that we

287
00:10:55.287 --> 00:10:58.807
are truly cosmic beings, multi-dimensional beings,

288
00:10:58.807 --> 00:11:00.327
and that we're part of the cosmos.

289
00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:01.106
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

290
00:11:01.106 --> 00:11:02.167
<v ->But this has been a planet,</v>

291
00:11:02.167 --> 00:11:03.707
it's been a lock down planet.

292
00:11:03.707 --> 00:11:05.513
<v Interviewer>Under lock down for quite</v>

293
00:11:05.513 --> 00:11:06.634
a long time.
<v David>Yeah, yeah.</v>

294
00:11:06.634 --> 00:11:09.214
<v Interviewer>Because you were such a--</v>

295
00:11:09.214 --> 00:11:12.520
<v ->But you know in the '60s, a lot of us went through</v>

296
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.881
the psychedelic revolution.

297
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:16.280
You know that was the big opening--
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

298
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.040
<v ->You know, I'll never, for a moment,</v>

299
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.540
ever put down the powerful influence of the

300
00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.581
ethinogenic psychedelic revolution.

301
00:11:24.581 --> 00:11:26.520
Because even if you look today you'll find out

302
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.761
some of the most amazing people out there

303
00:11:28.761 --> 00:11:31.448
who are doing incredible things,

304
00:11:31.448 --> 00:11:34.988
at some time not all obviously use psychedelics.

305
00:11:34.988 --> 00:11:36.894
<v Interviewer>Well it's still today Iowaska.</v>

306
00:11:36.894 --> 00:11:38.673
<v ->It's still happening, yeah.
<v Interviewer>And,</v>

307
00:11:38.673 --> 00:11:40.740
creating these experiences or having these

308
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.721
experiences with the shamans in the Brazilian jungle,

309
00:11:43.721 --> 00:11:45.760
I'd say it's still going on--
<v David>Oh yeah, sure.</v>

310
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.250
<v Interviewer>And brilliant people are coming out with</v>

311
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.550
their perceptions of what they're really tapping into

312
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:52.889
which is quite interesting.

313
00:11:52.889 --> 00:11:55.109
Now we're getting into DNA and a lot of

314
00:11:55.109 --> 00:11:56.690
crystal liquid--
<v David>Oh yeah yeah yeah.</v>

315
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.789
<v Interviewer>Liquid crystal and DNA, and a lot of</v>

316
00:11:58.789 --> 00:12:02.129
interesting subjects having to do with expanded

317
00:12:02.129 --> 00:12:04.169
consciousness, awareness of multi-dimensions

318
00:12:04.169 --> 00:12:04.949
and so forth.

319
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:07.790
<v ->That's the key is that the DNA,</v>

320
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.669
which I believe is created in the star system Sirius

321
00:12:10.669 --> 00:12:14.989
by the goddess is inherently designed to involve.

322
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.881
Now, what's interesting about DNA is

323
00:12:17.881 --> 00:12:20.070
it's very very...

324
00:12:21.947 --> 00:12:24.093
It's very much sensitive to sound,

325
00:12:24.093 --> 00:12:26.653
to vibration, that's why we do crystal bowls

326
00:12:26.653 --> 00:12:28.581
and toning, so people who are

327
00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:31.780
under negative electromagnetic frequencies

328
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.360
and dissonant music, it's very damaging

329
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.060
to the etheric and mental emotional bodies.

330
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.940
That's why I spend a lot of time hiking the Red,

331
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.540
I'm very conscious of what I'm infusing into my

332
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.560
conscious as a way of sound.
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

333
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.181
<v ->And it's interesting now you've got</v>

334
00:12:48.181 --> 00:12:50.200
thousands and thousands of people using crystal bowls

335
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.780
to tune their, and they're really changing our DNA

336
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.540
and as our DNA evolves and grows,

337
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.340
we're tapping into a higher level of consciousness.

338
00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.840
<v Interviewer>Let's talk about that--</v>

339
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.187
<v ->So the body--</v>

340
00:13:00.187 --> 00:13:01.846
<v Interviewer>Yes I do understand.</v>

341
00:13:01.846 --> 00:13:04.306
<v ->But the body is actually designed not to age,</v>

342
00:13:04.306 --> 00:13:06.166
we are actually going to come into a time

343
00:13:06.166 --> 00:13:08.166
of conscious immortality.

344
00:13:08.166 --> 00:13:08.927
<v Interviewer>I believe that,</v>

345
00:13:08.927 --> 00:13:12.359
and we're starting to see signs of it already.

346
00:13:12.359 --> 00:13:14.780
Because we could go 1,000 different directions,

347
00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.179
because you truly are a visionary of

348
00:13:17.179 --> 00:13:20.219
large proportions, I have immense admiration

349
00:13:20.219 --> 00:13:23.219
for the work you've been doing throughout your lifetime,

350
00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:26.039
we're going to have to probably go down--

351
00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:26.605
<v ->Okay.
<v Interviewer>Maybe one or</v>

352
00:13:26.605 --> 00:13:28.725
two pounds, 'cause we could take 100 of them,

353
00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:30.105
but since you brought this up

354
00:13:30.105 --> 00:13:33.246
this subject of light and sound and DNA,

355
00:13:33.246 --> 00:13:35.865
and these ancient healing arts,

356
00:13:35.865 --> 00:13:38.245
now coming back around and being given

357
00:13:38.245 --> 00:13:40.946
validation through the medical community

358
00:13:40.946 --> 00:13:42.405
and the scientific community.

359
00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:43.925
Can you talk a little bit about that

360
00:13:43.925 --> 00:13:46.025
for anyone who might be sitting a bit

361
00:13:46.025 --> 00:13:48.485
and saying, "Oh right, sound, light, color."

362
00:13:48.485 --> 00:13:52.284
As to why these are such essential foods.

363
00:13:53.071 --> 00:13:54.272
<v ->Well you're dealing with the language</v>

364
00:13:54.272 --> 00:13:56.532
of the subconscious and the soul.

365
00:13:56.532 --> 00:13:59.652
And ultimately the real purpose of healing is to reconnect

366
00:13:59.652 --> 00:14:01.291
with your essential self.

367
00:14:01.291 --> 00:14:03.412
A lot of the work that I do,

368
00:14:03.412 --> 00:14:05.232
which is really fun, the imagery,

369
00:14:05.232 --> 00:14:07.271
or sacred geometries,

370
00:14:07.271 --> 00:14:10.271
which is the language of the archetypal world.

371
00:14:10.271 --> 00:14:11.952
So when you watch this, whether you're aware of it

372
00:14:11.952 --> 00:14:14.832
or not, you're being consciously reconnected

373
00:14:14.832 --> 00:14:17.771
to your central self at the causal level.

374
00:14:17.771 --> 00:14:20.772
So when you actually meditate on these videos,

375
00:14:20.772 --> 00:14:23.771
you're actually being brought to a point,

376
00:14:23.771 --> 00:14:26.191
which is called the Yakada, the Supreme Self,

377
00:14:26.191 --> 00:14:27.972
there's one I just complete called Sacred,

378
00:14:27.972 --> 00:14:30.192
was just saying to friends of mine, I said,

379
00:14:30.192 --> 00:14:32.732
"If people watch this for an hour,

380
00:14:32.732 --> 00:14:36.231
"they'll really be conscious transformation."

381
00:14:36.231 --> 00:14:38.951
Because you're infusing the subconscious mind

382
00:14:38.951 --> 00:14:41.252
with superconscious imagery.

383
00:14:41.252 --> 00:14:43.632
So it's basically awakening people consciously

384
00:14:43.632 --> 00:14:46.991
to our essential mutli-dimensional infinite level,

385
00:14:46.991 --> 00:14:48.871
which is God is all that is.

386
00:14:48.871 --> 00:14:51.952
<v Interviewer>And this is really the word right now</v>

387
00:14:51.952 --> 00:14:54.871
is being able to access our multidimensional.

388
00:14:54.871 --> 00:14:55.812
<v ->Yeah.</v>

389
00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:57.431
<v Interviewer>Some people, I think Stephen Hawkings</v>

390
00:14:57.431 --> 00:14:59.837
calls it your hyper spacial counterpart.

391
00:14:59.837 --> 00:15:01.437
<v ->Yeah.
<v Interviewer>Whatever you want to call it.</v>

392
00:15:01.437 --> 00:15:04.658
That other aspect itself that it always exists.

393
00:15:04.658 --> 00:15:06.904
<v ->Once the fear and the conditioning program,</v>

394
00:15:06.904 --> 00:15:09.964
they say that there are basically three levels of freedom.

395
00:15:09.964 --> 00:15:12.249
There's awareness, which is understanding,

396
00:15:12.249 --> 00:15:14.088
truly knowing that you are already free.

397
00:15:14.088 --> 00:15:16.088
Nothing can take that away from you.

398
00:15:16.088 --> 00:15:17.727
Your true nature is freedom.

399
00:15:17.727 --> 00:15:20.268
Then there's the psychological, biological level,

400
00:15:20.268 --> 00:15:22.728
which is where processes work to clear out conditioning,

401
00:15:22.728 --> 00:15:25.227
fear programming, limitation consciousness.

402
00:15:25.227 --> 00:15:27.208
Then there's biological freedom where, you know,

403
00:15:27.208 --> 00:15:29.988
if you're a dancer or a yogi, of course yoga pretition

404
00:15:29.988 --> 00:15:32.229
deals with all of it, where you feel free in your body.

405
00:15:32.229 --> 00:15:33.088
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

406
00:15:33.088 --> 00:15:34.907
<v ->Now if you're free on any of these levels,</v>

407
00:15:34.907 --> 00:15:36.628
psychologically free, it's holographic,

408
00:15:36.628 --> 00:15:38.468
then you're gonna be spiritually free.

409
00:15:38.468 --> 00:15:39.827
If you're biologically free, if you're doing,

410
00:15:39.827 --> 00:15:42.728
you're going to be able to open up more

411
00:15:42.728 --> 00:15:44.328
to your spiritual self.

412
00:15:44.328 --> 00:15:47.707
So the importance of exercise, staying fluid,

413
00:15:47.707 --> 00:15:50.912
drinking water, under consuming food, learning

414
00:15:50.912 --> 00:15:54.132
to detoxify the body, which is a lot of what we emphasize.

415
00:15:54.132 --> 00:15:56.873
Does wonders as far as opening you up to the source

416
00:15:56.873 --> 00:15:58.352
of guidance and creativity.

417
00:15:58.352 --> 00:16:00.112
You really feel good about yourself.

418
00:16:00.112 --> 00:16:01.272
<v Interviewer>Mmm-hmm.</v>

419
00:16:01.272 --> 00:16:02.093
<v ->Which is primary.</v>

420
00:16:02.093 --> 00:16:04.032
And if you feel really good about yourself,

421
00:16:04.032 --> 00:16:06.153
you're then you're gonna feel empowered about the world,

422
00:16:06.153 --> 00:16:09.372
rather than being frightened by the world, or disempowered.

423
00:16:09.372 --> 00:16:11.953
So naturally, you bring that center, that creativity,

424
00:16:11.953 --> 00:16:14.113
that empowerment, that enlightenment, which is

425
00:16:14.113 --> 00:16:17.453
an ongoing process into the realm of creativity

426
00:16:17.453 --> 00:16:20.759
and being a good planetary steward.

427
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.390
It's just all logical.

428
00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:23.791
<v Interviewer>It makes total sense.</v>

429
00:16:23.791 --> 00:16:26.950
In both a non linear and a linear fashion.

430
00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:29.310
And I think most people can relate even in

431
00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.856
the simplest and most subtle sense is,

432
00:16:31.856 --> 00:16:35.617
I love your video by the way, the videos with the

433
00:16:35.617 --> 00:16:38.697
geometrical forms, because it's taking you back

434
00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:41.136
to the experience of looking through a kaleidoscope

435
00:16:41.136 --> 00:16:45.497
as a child, and that magic and the excitement that happens

436
00:16:45.497 --> 00:16:48.416
on a cellular level as a little kid when you're

437
00:16:48.416 --> 00:16:49.936
looking through those kaleidoscopes.

438
00:16:51.583 --> 00:16:54.622
It seems to inspire these same sorts of reactions watching

439
00:16:54.622 --> 00:16:57.362
your videos, and then combining it with sound.

440
00:16:57.362 --> 00:17:00.533
<v ->Well it's an art, we call it art-ainment, but it's beauty</v>

441
00:17:02.127 --> 00:17:04.128
from a Tibetan Buddhist perspective.

442
00:17:04.128 --> 00:17:06.729
Or if we can come totally into present time

443
00:17:06.729 --> 00:17:09.688
and the mind moves out of judgement.

444
00:17:10.594 --> 00:17:13.354
Then we open to world, we look at the world

445
00:17:13.354 --> 00:17:16.579
and rather than see it from a negative

446
00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.400
perspective, you see it for what it really is

447
00:17:19.725 --> 00:17:21.245
and it's really beautiful.

448
00:17:21.245 --> 00:17:22.806
I mean, you study nature.

449
00:17:22.806 --> 00:17:26.246
I mean, of course we've spoiled it to a large degree.

450
00:17:26.246 --> 00:17:28.106
But I go out, I go out and I hike,

451
00:17:28.106 --> 00:17:30.086
I go out to North Beach, and I always

452
00:17:30.086 --> 00:17:32.846
make that connection as a reminder.

453
00:17:32.846 --> 00:17:35.826
And continually, because I know we're shifting dimensions.

454
00:17:35.826 --> 00:17:38.966
But I see and respect the awesomeness of nature,

455
00:17:38.966 --> 00:17:40.046
and I see the inherent beauty,

456
00:17:40.046 --> 00:17:41.726
which inspires me to do the art.

457
00:17:41.726 --> 00:17:44.846
Now this is not a majority perspective by any,

458
00:17:44.846 --> 00:17:47.785
because most people are living in cities

459
00:17:47.785 --> 00:17:51.026
or dealing with very man made, harsh environments.

460
00:17:51.026 --> 00:17:54.807
So I'm just attempting, like with beauty, to remind people

461
00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:58.525
of the beauty that really exists as an artist,

462
00:17:58.525 --> 00:18:00.206
which is real for me.

463
00:18:00.206 --> 00:18:02.426
<v Interviewer>In this culture, in much of the</v>

464
00:18:02.426 --> 00:18:04.726
Western world, that seems to be one

465
00:18:04.726 --> 00:18:06.646
of the greatest losses we've experienced

466
00:18:06.646 --> 00:18:10.285
is our understanding and appreciation for

467
00:18:10.285 --> 00:18:13.323
an understanding absolute need for beauty and symmetry.

468
00:18:13.323 --> 00:18:15.524
<v ->Well disconnect to nature,</v>

469
00:18:15.524 --> 00:18:18.973
which is really the fundamental disconnect from our own

470
00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:22.790
nature is what's responsible for the havoc in the world,

471
00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.430
a far as I'm concerned.

472
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:27.110
It's a disconnect from our own true nature,

473
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:29.669
which translates as a disconnect to nature.

474
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:31.970
<v Interviewer>So beauty needs to be infused back into</v>

475
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.710
the life on our lives in many levels.

476
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:35.710
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

477
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:37.610
<v Interviewer>Through sound, through art,</v>

478
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:40.130
through sacred geometry, through light.

479
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.330
<v ->I mean today we have a site of art-tainment,</v>

480
00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:46.790
we like a list of maybe 600 fabulous artists.

481
00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:48.429
I mean the artists are out there.

482
00:18:48.429 --> 00:18:51.590
But we have, the current culture,

483
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:54.089
the American culture, is very superficial

484
00:18:54.089 --> 00:18:56.489
and most people aren't even aware

485
00:18:56.489 --> 00:18:58.470
of this level of art and creativity,

486
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.925
cause they're bombarded with MTV,

487
00:19:00.925 --> 00:19:04.886
the hip-hop, which is far as I'm concerned,

488
00:19:04.886 --> 00:19:07.146
not to say it's all, it's pretty meaningless

489
00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:09.526
and it's mundane, it's profane, you know.

490
00:19:09.526 --> 00:19:13.666
So we've lost the profundity into the profanity,

491
00:19:14.679 --> 00:19:16.199
and therefore it's meaningless,

492
00:19:16.199 --> 00:19:19.358
So that creates a nihilistic or existential culture

493
00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:20.779
where nothing matters anymore,

494
00:19:20.779 --> 00:19:22.898
and that's materialism.

495
00:19:22.898 --> 00:19:24.679
<v Interviewer>And isn't that why, for example,</v>

496
00:19:24.679 --> 00:19:27.979
the, in sense of pornographic sites,

497
00:19:27.979 --> 00:19:30.538
really are the best, that's the best selling material

498
00:19:30.538 --> 00:19:32.558
out there on the world wide web.

499
00:19:32.558 --> 00:19:35.579
Isn't that in large part, due to the fact that

500
00:19:36.279 --> 00:19:38.937
<v ->People need, people want to be stimulated.</v>

501
00:19:38.937 --> 00:19:40.757
<v Interviewer>Because we've lost our ability</v>

502
00:19:40.757 --> 00:19:43.798
to connect with the more subtle stimuli of life.

503
00:19:43.798 --> 00:19:46.557
<v ->Well the universe is erotic, it's rooted in love.</v>

504
00:19:46.557 --> 00:19:50.197
And there are different levels, think about the average guy

505
00:19:50.197 --> 00:19:51.537
what they're going through.

506
00:19:51.537 --> 00:19:53.936
They're either sitting in front of a little shell in

507
00:19:53.936 --> 00:19:56.977
bad lighting in an office building

508
00:19:56.977 --> 00:19:59.797
and really wrapped up and constricted,

509
00:19:59.797 --> 00:20:01.937
and they go home and they're driving in their car.

510
00:20:01.937 --> 00:20:04.537
So they're, the body, the personality,

511
00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:07.438
the liver is taught, people are very frustrated.

512
00:20:07.438 --> 00:20:09.957
So they're looking for pornography, some kinda outlet

513
00:20:09.957 --> 00:20:10.935
just like--
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

514
00:20:10.935 --> 00:20:14.215
<v ->You know, sports is another outlet,</v>

515
00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:16.951
if you go to the movies today,

516
00:20:16.951 --> 00:20:18.531
I mean there's some good movies out there.

517
00:20:18.531 --> 00:20:21.150
But the sound that you're bombarded with

518
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:24.051
more and more, 10 million dollar special effects stuff.

519
00:20:24.051 --> 00:20:25.571
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>
<v ->Your outrageous car scene,</v>

520
00:20:25.571 --> 00:20:27.170
'cause this gives people some level of

521
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:28.571
feeling alive.

522
00:20:28.571 --> 00:20:30.370
Rather than just being able to, for me,

523
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.791
one of my big thrills is just taking a hike

524
00:20:32.791 --> 00:20:33.831
in the Redwoods,

525
00:20:33.831 --> 00:20:37.491
I can honestly say this is absolute gospel truth,

526
00:20:37.491 --> 00:20:39.071
for 12 years when I was living

527
00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:40.990
around the part, I walked in the Redwoods

528
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.731
every day for 12 years.

529
00:20:42.731 --> 00:20:43.971
<v Interviewer>I believe it, having lived</v>

530
00:20:43.971 --> 00:20:45.850
Middle Valley before myself.

531
00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.791
<v ->Never bored, it was always a new experience--</v>

532
00:20:47.791 --> 00:20:48.731
<v Interviewer>It's so beautiful.</v>

533
00:20:48.731 --> 00:20:50.030
<v ->And I always gave thanks--
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

534
00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.070
<v ->Just to be able to have that experience,</v>

535
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.451
but to be in that power, that beauty,

536
00:20:54.451 --> 00:20:55.370
and that pristine--

537
00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:56.271
<v Interviewer>Those trees.</v>

538
00:20:56.271 --> 00:20:58.851
<v ->You know, it's a spiritual experience.</v>

539
00:20:58.851 --> 00:20:59.991
<v Interviewer>It definitely is,</v>

540
00:20:59.991 --> 00:21:02.671
but it is a more subtle type of joy,

541
00:21:02.671 --> 00:21:04.524
<v ->It's being.
<v Interviewer>And even something</v>

542
00:21:04.524 --> 00:21:06.423
as simple as a smile or really

543
00:21:06.423 --> 00:21:09.284
allowing yourself to look in another person's eyes

544
00:21:09.284 --> 00:21:12.463
for some people, that's a terrifying concept.

545
00:21:12.463 --> 00:21:15.064
And so, and I'm not

546
00:21:15.064 --> 00:21:18.005
saying, to each his own,

547
00:21:18.005 --> 00:21:20.824
whatever is the stimuli that a person needs,

548
00:21:20.824 --> 00:21:24.644
but I think the point I'm making is that,

549
00:21:24.644 --> 00:21:27.265
just what you were saying, the grosser types

550
00:21:27.265 --> 00:21:30.224
of entertainment in terms of their density

551
00:21:30.224 --> 00:21:32.663
is really shutting us down further and further--

552
00:21:32.663 --> 00:21:33.341
<v ->Big time.
<v Interviewer>From our connection</v>

553
00:21:33.341 --> 00:21:35.320
with our true selves, because we are losing

554
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.141
the self.

555
00:21:36.141 --> 00:21:38.701
<v ->Well this is a society loaded with distractions.</v>

556
00:21:38.701 --> 00:21:39.340
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

557
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.681
And so what you're trying to do really

558
00:21:41.681 --> 00:21:45.101
is create a refinement, and a sense of aesthetics

559
00:21:45.101 --> 00:21:48.402
to reconnect and open to the self again

560
00:21:48.402 --> 00:21:50.521
so that the self can begin making what?

561
00:21:50.521 --> 00:21:52.201
Wiser decisions?
<v DaVid>Yeah.</v>

562
00:21:52.201 --> 00:21:53.600
<v Interviewer>Finding harmony in balance?</v>

563
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.641
<v ->Well, you know, one of the things on my</v>

564
00:21:55.641 --> 00:21:57.841
about the light part, I talk about wisdom.

565
00:21:57.841 --> 00:22:01.201
And DaVid's three definitions of wisdom is,

566
00:22:01.201 --> 00:22:03.761
wisdom is knowing what to do next,

567
00:22:03.761 --> 00:22:06.661
wisdom is understanding what works,

568
00:22:06.661 --> 00:22:08.421
and wisdom is understanding respecting

569
00:22:08.421 --> 00:22:09.961
the laws of nature.

570
00:22:09.961 --> 00:22:11.541
And if you're gonna pray for anything

571
00:22:11.541 --> 00:22:12.661
you pray for wisdom because

572
00:22:12.661 --> 00:22:15.621
our life is absolutely dependent upon

573
00:22:15.621 --> 00:22:17.661
individually and collectively now

574
00:22:17.661 --> 00:22:20.121
to wise up, because we have to start making

575
00:22:20.121 --> 00:22:22.761
billions of new choices.

576
00:22:22.761 --> 00:22:24.121
<v Interviewer>Yes we do, and in fact</v>

577
00:22:24.121 --> 00:22:27.002
Wired magazine in one of their articles last year said,

578
00:22:27.002 --> 00:22:29.201
"Wisdom is the up-and-coming

579
00:22:29.201 --> 00:22:31.321
"most valuable commodity now."

580
00:22:31.321 --> 00:22:33.561
<v ->And one of the things I feel or see</v>

581
00:22:33.561 --> 00:22:35.741
about nature is how the universe

582
00:22:35.741 --> 00:22:39.021
is sort of still running the show so to speak.

583
00:22:39.021 --> 00:22:41.201
So I said, we have our own agenda

584
00:22:41.201 --> 00:22:43.180
and the universe has its own agenda,

585
00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.122
is that it's all about slowing down.

586
00:22:45.122 --> 00:22:47.942
And it's really beginning to appreciate the moment,

587
00:22:47.942 --> 00:22:49.220
I mean this has been said,

588
00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.821
ad infinidum ad noisum by all the teachers.

589
00:22:51.821 --> 00:22:53.540
But that's where life is to be enjoyed,

590
00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.421
in the moment.

591
00:22:54.421 --> 00:22:56.081
I mean what's the rush?

592
00:22:56.081 --> 00:22:57.800
We've been around for forever

593
00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.401
and we're gonna always be around forever.

594
00:22:59.401 --> 00:23:00.841
<v Interviewer>Let's talk about what's the rush,</v>

595
00:23:00.841 --> 00:23:03.382
people feel this impending sense of

596
00:23:04.608 --> 00:23:06.988
something running up along the backside of them

597
00:23:06.988 --> 00:23:09.708
that's going to catch them and overtake them

598
00:23:09.708 --> 00:23:13.188
and I think this is common in a world that is

599
00:23:13.188 --> 00:23:14.568
driven by competition.

600
00:23:14.568 --> 00:23:15.228
<v ->Yes.</v>

601
00:23:15.228 --> 00:23:16.829
<v Interviewer>Rather than synergy,</v>

602
00:23:16.829 --> 00:23:19.469
and this is the main area I want to get to

603
00:23:19.469 --> 00:23:21.008
with you because some of what you have

604
00:23:21.008 --> 00:23:22.668
on your side and in your writing

605
00:23:22.668 --> 00:23:24.788
is just beautiful about synergy,

606
00:23:24.788 --> 00:23:28.567
and since politics is an area you are interested in

607
00:23:28.567 --> 00:23:30.847
in the largest purest sense of the word,

608
00:23:30.847 --> 00:23:35.847
how do we transform an intrinsically competitive,

609
00:23:35.868 --> 00:23:40.028
fearful society into one that operates synergistically?

610
00:23:40.028 --> 00:23:42.648
<v ->Well, the first thing, and I think it's one of the</v>

611
00:23:42.648 --> 00:23:44.808
great gifts of the Light Party is that we're offering

612
00:23:44.808 --> 00:23:46.267
a positive vision.

613
00:23:46.267 --> 00:23:47.988
Of health, peace, and freedom for all,

614
00:23:47.988 --> 00:23:50.148
not only is it abstract possibility,

615
00:23:50.148 --> 00:23:52.668
but a very strong probability that

616
00:23:52.668 --> 00:23:54.328
involves all of us.

617
00:23:54.328 --> 00:23:56.828
And, most people are running around

618
00:23:56.828 --> 00:23:58.548
because of pressure.

619
00:23:58.548 --> 00:24:01.107
Unconscious pressure, survival pressure,

620
00:24:01.107 --> 00:24:03.408
real pressure, whatever, just to pay

621
00:24:03.408 --> 00:24:05.928
for the cost of living, survival is

622
00:24:05.928 --> 00:24:09.168
what 95, 96%

623
00:24:09.168 --> 00:24:12.587
of what humanity is under, is pressure.

624
00:24:12.587 --> 00:24:16.488
So how do we, a lot of what my program is about,

625
00:24:16.488 --> 00:24:18.408
how do we destress ourselves,

626
00:24:18.408 --> 00:24:21.047
ourselves and our planetary ecosystem?

627
00:24:21.047 --> 00:24:23.347
And the bottom line, and this is going to take

628
00:24:23.347 --> 00:24:25.209
something that has to be implemented,

629
00:24:25.209 --> 00:24:26.709
I also believe that there's gonna be some

630
00:24:26.709 --> 00:24:30.267
extraordinary events happening from extraterrestrial

631
00:24:30.267 --> 00:24:32.709
intelligences impacting what's going to happen

632
00:24:32.709 --> 00:24:33.487
on planet Earth.

633
00:24:33.487 --> 00:24:35.229
But how do we create a system that takes

634
00:24:35.229 --> 00:24:36.649
the pressure off ourselves?

635
00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:38.208
Very simple, as long as we're involved

636
00:24:38.208 --> 00:24:39.788
with a finite energy system,

637
00:24:39.788 --> 00:24:41.429
oil, coal, whatever,

638
00:24:41.429 --> 00:24:43.408
we're always going to be under intense

639
00:24:43.408 --> 00:24:45.808
economic pressure and also the potential

640
00:24:45.808 --> 00:24:47.628
for war over resources.

641
00:24:47.628 --> 00:24:50.767
And yet we have the ability to create

642
00:24:50.767 --> 00:24:53.448
an economic system based on unlimited energy.

643
00:24:53.448 --> 00:24:55.409
<v Interviewer>Right, it already exists.</v>

644
00:24:55.409 --> 00:24:58.668
<v ->Right, so as a national and global priority,</v>

645
00:24:58.668 --> 00:25:01.006
when people would become really conscious

646
00:25:01.006 --> 00:25:04.546
we're gonna insist on developing a sustainable energy

647
00:25:04.546 --> 00:25:07.646
system, which in, let's say it's a five year project,

648
00:25:07.646 --> 00:25:09.046
or even a 10 year project,

649
00:25:09.046 --> 00:25:11.266
if we all knew in a practical way

650
00:25:11.266 --> 00:25:12.627
that I decided, I say,

651
00:25:12.627 --> 00:25:14.705
"Okay, I'll pay 20 cents more in the gas tank

652
00:25:14.705 --> 00:25:16.947
"to put that money into alternative energy."

653
00:25:16.947 --> 00:25:19.527
To say for the future that in five years, six years,

654
00:25:19.527 --> 00:25:21.486
whatever it is, we will have basically clean,

655
00:25:21.486 --> 00:25:22.886
unlimited energy.

656
00:25:22.886 --> 00:25:25.206
The cost of energy will basically become

657
00:25:25.206 --> 00:25:28.666
for all intensive purposes zero.

658
00:25:29.606 --> 00:25:30.615
It's like what happened when they

659
00:25:30.615 --> 00:25:33.252
set up the fiber optics for

660
00:25:33.252 --> 00:25:36.074
telephones, initially it was a great capital

661
00:25:36.074 --> 00:25:38.653
outlay to build the system, but now phones are,

662
00:25:38.653 --> 00:25:40.612
you know, three cents, four cents.

663
00:25:40.612 --> 00:25:43.573
Well if you put the system into place,

664
00:25:43.573 --> 00:25:45.513
we will create a system where energy is unlimited

665
00:25:45.513 --> 00:25:47.193
and clean and sustainable, and we're basically

666
00:25:47.193 --> 00:25:48.252
freed up.

667
00:25:48.252 --> 00:25:49.669
<v Interviewer>So, that's number one--</v>

668
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:51.350
<v ->So people aren't gonna have to work,</v>

669
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.629
I mean you'll be working less and less,

670
00:25:52.629 --> 00:25:54.266
you have a life, we're giving life back--

671
00:25:54.266 --> 00:25:55.206
<v Interviewer>So we stress ourselves basically</v>

672
00:25:55.206 --> 00:25:56.406
by not being reliant upon

673
00:25:56.406 --> 00:25:58.205
nonrenewable resources.

674
00:25:58.205 --> 00:26:01.506
<v ->It's a prime, we've got the global warming story,</v>

675
00:26:01.506 --> 00:26:03.385
and we're up against it.

676
00:26:03.385 --> 00:26:05.306
I mean it's just like grace,

677
00:26:05.306 --> 00:26:06.803
and saying look what are we willing to give

678
00:26:06.803 --> 00:26:09.783
to ourselves, to not only take care of the ecosystem

679
00:26:09.783 --> 00:26:11.782
the planet which is absolutely

680
00:26:11.782 --> 00:26:15.162
the number one thing as far as our planetary survival,

681
00:26:15.162 --> 00:26:17.243
it's common sense, we've got to clean up the atmosphere,

682
00:26:17.243 --> 00:26:18.723
but we can create a system

683
00:26:18.723 --> 00:26:20.682
you know this is what Bucky Fuller was talking about.

684
00:26:20.682 --> 00:26:23.803
That spaceship Earth, everybody's needs

685
00:26:23.803 --> 00:26:26.323
are taken care of, and we're living in a whole 'nother world.

686
00:26:26.323 --> 00:26:28.823
The world of freedom and love

687
00:26:28.823 --> 00:26:30.342
and you have time for yourself.

688
00:26:30.342 --> 00:26:31.723
That's really what people want more than

689
00:26:31.723 --> 00:26:34.083
anything else, and I say I've created a lot of

690
00:26:34.083 --> 00:26:35.562
time for myself.

691
00:26:35.562 --> 00:26:36.802
I stepped out of the whole,

692
00:26:36.802 --> 00:26:38.823
and I'm fortunate I mean my foundation

693
00:26:38.823 --> 00:26:41.003
is relatively funded, but I'm not

694
00:26:41.003 --> 00:26:43.143
anything but a materialistic person.

695
00:26:43.143 --> 00:26:45.569
And I have nothing against things,

696
00:26:45.569 --> 00:26:46.815
I just live real simple.

697
00:26:46.815 --> 00:26:48.935
Because I like to keep my life simple.

698
00:26:48.935 --> 00:26:51.256
<v Interviewer>Well your value system is such that</v>

699
00:26:51.256 --> 00:26:52.915
it doesn't require a lot of things.

700
00:26:52.915 --> 00:26:55.706
<v ->I'm very zen in that way, I don't eat a lot</v>

701
00:26:55.706 --> 00:26:58.148
of food, I'm just,

702
00:26:58.148 --> 00:27:00.087
my creativity and my own focus

703
00:27:00.087 --> 00:27:01.287
keeps me really occupied,

704
00:27:01.287 --> 00:27:02.766
that's very,

705
00:27:02.766 --> 00:27:05.727
keeps me involved and happy with my life.

706
00:27:05.727 --> 00:27:07.027
'Cause I feel I'm in service,

707
00:27:07.027 --> 00:27:08.307
I'm doing something

708
00:27:08.307 --> 00:27:09.887
that has meaning to me

709
00:27:09.887 --> 00:27:13.087
and I also know that I'm involved with spreading

710
00:27:13.087 --> 00:27:15.787
a lot of good info to millions of people,

711
00:27:15.787 --> 00:27:17.307
take it or leave it you know?

712
00:27:17.307 --> 00:27:19.707
So, I feel really blessed 'cause I'm on purpose

713
00:27:19.707 --> 00:27:21.767
in my life, and that's really what people want,

714
00:27:21.767 --> 00:27:24.407
to be on purpose and more time for themselves

715
00:27:24.407 --> 00:27:26.147
so how do we create a society and a culture

716
00:27:26.147 --> 00:27:28.768
that's demanding us to have more time?

717
00:27:28.768 --> 00:27:31.087
Because the other system is total breakdown.

718
00:27:31.087 --> 00:27:33.267
If you study the health of the people,

719
00:27:33.267 --> 00:27:36.348
90% of this is stress related diseases.

720
00:27:36.348 --> 00:27:38.287
<v Interviewer>That's right, we're breaking down</v>

721
00:27:38.287 --> 00:27:39.872
as a civilization--

722
00:27:39.872 --> 00:27:40.986
<v ->Immune systems right.</v>

723
00:27:40.986 --> 00:27:43.425
Yeah, because it's running out of control.

724
00:27:43.425 --> 00:27:44.805
<v Interviewer>We're running on adrenaline.</v>

725
00:27:44.805 --> 00:27:45.925
<v ->Right.</v>

726
00:27:45.925 --> 00:27:46.585
<v Interviewer>So--</v>

727
00:27:46.585 --> 00:27:48.692
<v ->We're running on fear.</v>

728
00:27:48.692 --> 00:27:50.993
<v Interviewer>And fear, exactly.</v>

729
00:27:50.993 --> 00:27:53.833
So what are some of the next steps

730
00:27:53.833 --> 00:27:55.053
you would be taking then,

731
00:27:55.053 --> 00:27:56.872
so first we addressed this

732
00:27:56.872 --> 00:28:00.392
subject of the environment and nonrenewable resources,

733
00:28:00.392 --> 00:28:01.712
then where do we go?

734
00:28:01.712 --> 00:28:04.373
<v ->And it's coming, it's absolutely imperative</v>

735
00:28:04.373 --> 00:28:07.112
that we have universal single payer

736
00:28:07.112 --> 00:28:08.612
plan health insurance.

737
00:28:08.612 --> 00:28:10.572
This is like core issue now.

738
00:28:10.572 --> 00:28:11.433
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

739
00:28:11.433 --> 00:28:14.072
<v ->And in that the insurance companies pay</v>

740
00:28:14.072 --> 00:28:17.513
for, what you know in quotes complimentary medicine.

741
00:28:17.513 --> 00:28:20.392
Desensualization, we're totally about desensualization

742
00:28:20.392 --> 00:28:22.593
of power, the empowerment of the individual

743
00:28:22.593 --> 00:28:25.053
and to realize that each of us are connected

744
00:28:25.053 --> 00:28:26.673
to supreme source.

745
00:28:26.673 --> 00:28:29.473
Infinite love, infinite wisdom,

746
00:28:29.473 --> 00:28:31.713
infinite power, that's a fact.

747
00:28:31.713 --> 00:28:33.112
You can debate it, argue it,

748
00:28:33.112 --> 00:28:35.172
that's what is.

749
00:28:35.172 --> 00:28:37.192
Now to the degree that we're accessing that

750
00:28:37.192 --> 00:28:38.712
or being accessed by that is

751
00:28:38.712 --> 00:28:40.672
dependent upon each person's individual

752
00:28:40.672 --> 00:28:42.812
evolution in their own consciousness.

753
00:28:42.812 --> 00:28:46.233
But together, together this is what Aquarius is about,

754
00:28:46.233 --> 00:28:48.612
we have the power to move mountains.

755
00:28:48.612 --> 00:28:50.753
That's why you're seeing happening

756
00:28:50.753 --> 00:28:52.572
synergistically all over the world now.

757
00:28:52.572 --> 00:28:55.452
Peace meditations, invocations,

758
00:28:55.452 --> 00:28:57.873
this is the work of the Light workers,

759
00:28:57.873 --> 00:28:59.772
that is affecting the conscience,

760
00:28:59.772 --> 00:29:00.852
if this was not going on

761
00:29:00.852 --> 00:29:03.113
the war in the Middle East would be,

762
00:29:03.113 --> 00:29:06.012
the level of violence that's on this planet

763
00:29:06.012 --> 00:29:08.592
would be much more escalated in my belief.

764
00:29:08.592 --> 00:29:10.732
Because we're grounding more energy

765
00:29:10.732 --> 00:29:12.312
we're invoking the energies of peace,

766
00:29:12.312 --> 00:29:14.612
we're invoking the energies of light

767
00:29:14.612 --> 00:29:16.492
and we're invoking the energies of love,

768
00:29:16.492 --> 00:29:18.732
non-judgmental, and we're transforming the

769
00:29:18.732 --> 00:29:20.892
collective consciousness on this planet.

770
00:29:20.892 --> 00:29:23.093
That's why ultimately we will have

771
00:29:23.093 --> 00:29:25.192
a golden age, and we will have

772
00:29:25.192 --> 00:29:26.492
what's called Heaven on Earth

773
00:29:26.492 --> 00:29:28.272
which always exists right here right now.

774
00:29:28.272 --> 00:29:30.832
'Cause it's a state of consciousness,

775
00:29:30.832 --> 00:29:32.392
but concurrent with that is the fact

776
00:29:32.392 --> 00:29:34.873
that the Earth is ascending.

777
00:29:34.873 --> 00:29:37.372
The Earth, now how many of us are gonna be

778
00:29:37.372 --> 00:29:39.112
on an ascended planet nobody really know.

779
00:29:39.112 --> 00:29:39.913
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

780
00:29:39.913 --> 00:29:41.513
<v ->But the Earth is ascending,</v>

781
00:29:41.513 --> 00:29:43.692
which was always known by the mystics

782
00:29:43.692 --> 00:29:45.592
and by the Mayans, that there would be

783
00:29:45.592 --> 00:29:46.060
an important time.
<v Interviewer>It's shifting</v>

784
00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.099
in zone frequencies.

785
00:29:47.099 --> 00:29:48.260
<v ->Right, because it's just</v>

786
00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.739
part of a grand galactic solar universal event.

787
00:29:52.739 --> 00:29:55.199
And with that shift of consciousness

788
00:29:55.199 --> 00:29:57.960
we're going to get in touch with other civilizations,

789
00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.540
extraterrestrial civilizations,

790
00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:00.246
extraterrestrial, people might think,

791
00:30:00.246 --> 00:30:01.146
"Oh who's this guy?

792
00:30:01.146 --> 00:30:01.532
"He's California."

793
00:30:01.532 --> 00:30:03.632
I have no doubt for a moment,

794
00:30:03.632 --> 00:30:05.272
not only no doubt of that the experience,

795
00:30:05.272 --> 00:30:07.251
that we're not alone in this universe.

796
00:30:07.251 --> 00:30:09.951
I mean, the scientists now know that there's

797
00:30:09.951 --> 00:30:12.091
literally billions of stars,

798
00:30:12.091 --> 00:30:13.832
and there's actually billions of galaxies.

799
00:30:13.832 --> 00:30:15.331
<v Interviewer>Well even in the world of physics</v>

800
00:30:15.331 --> 00:30:17.651
Mitch Ucoco and others even say,

801
00:30:17.651 --> 00:30:21.311
it's dreaming to think that we're the most

802
00:30:21.311 --> 00:30:24.092
intelligent species and only intelligent species

803
00:30:24.092 --> 00:30:26.331
in the cosmos, that would be the big joke.

804
00:30:26.331 --> 00:30:29.231
<v ->Well, but what's very interesting paradoxically</v>

805
00:30:29.231 --> 00:30:31.451
and this is what the Kabbalists have said,

806
00:30:31.451 --> 00:30:33.512
is that man, when I say man humanity,

807
00:30:33.512 --> 00:30:35.331
is unique in the creation of the whole universe.

808
00:30:35.331 --> 00:30:37.591
Because we have a physical dimension,

809
00:30:37.591 --> 00:30:39.431
but we have infinite consciousness.

810
00:30:39.431 --> 00:30:41.712
So each of us, and that's one of the things

811
00:30:41.712 --> 00:30:43.772
you'll see in the videos,

812
00:30:43.772 --> 00:30:45.751
I have this greater maze,

813
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:49.370
there is a center point called the Prime Creator,

814
00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:52.869
and that Prime Creator is connected to every one of us,

815
00:30:52.869 --> 00:30:54.630
and every one of us is truly connected

816
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:56.730
to everything else.

817
00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:57.490
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

818
00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:59.790
<v ->And we actually have a geometric image</v>

819
00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.970
rather than intellectualizing as a people

820
00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:04.529
watch this, it's called a greater maze,

821
00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:07.150
it's in Mandallah, friend of mine created it.

822
00:31:08.157 --> 00:31:10.337
You get that awareness without anybody

823
00:31:10.337 --> 00:31:11.577
hitting you over the head with it.

824
00:31:11.577 --> 00:31:13.637
Not gonna get any sermons about it or,

825
00:31:13.637 --> 00:31:15.617
you get it exponentially, 'cause that's what

826
00:31:15.617 --> 00:31:17.796
exporentially 'cause that's what I'm interested.

827
00:31:17.796 --> 00:31:19.496
I'm interested in people having

828
00:31:19.496 --> 00:31:22.376
a direct awareness, because once you have that awareness

829
00:31:22.376 --> 00:31:24.077
it becomes real for you, and then

830
00:31:24.077 --> 00:31:27.037
out of that awareness comes right action

831
00:31:27.037 --> 00:31:28.537
from a Buddhist perspective.

832
00:31:28.537 --> 00:31:29.916
Right action, right thought,

833
00:31:29.916 --> 00:31:32.357
and then everything kind of takes care of itself.

834
00:31:32.357 --> 00:31:34.756
So a lot of what I'm about is just comparing people

835
00:31:34.756 --> 00:31:36.616
without telling people necessarily what to do,

836
00:31:36.616 --> 00:31:38.983
suggestions, yes, knowing that once people

837
00:31:38.983 --> 00:31:40.843
become empowered they inherently will know

838
00:31:40.843 --> 00:31:43.303
what constitutes right action.

839
00:31:43.303 --> 00:31:44.003
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

840
00:31:44.003 --> 00:31:45.482
<v ->When you get millions of people</v>

841
00:31:45.482 --> 00:31:47.203
who are on the ball so to speak,

842
00:31:47.203 --> 00:31:48.362
everything takes care of itself,

843
00:31:48.362 --> 00:31:50.462
you take care of your own little environment

844
00:31:50.462 --> 00:31:52.363
and then that little environment starts

845
00:31:52.363 --> 00:31:54.802
exponentially, you know, you clean up your house,

846
00:31:54.802 --> 00:31:57.022
you get good water for yourself.

847
00:31:57.022 --> 00:31:59.482
Whatever you need to do, turn your own

848
00:31:59.482 --> 00:32:02.921
micro-environment into a sacred temple

849
00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:04.722
Azshran space.

850
00:32:04.722 --> 00:32:06.023
<v Interviewer>Yes, very important.</v>

851
00:32:06.023 --> 00:32:07.642
<v ->It's your own, lot of people--</v>

852
00:32:07.642 --> 00:32:10.277
<v Interviewer>So it really does start and can start</v>

853
00:32:10.277 --> 00:32:11.976
on a very personal level.
<v DaVid>Has to, has to.</v>

854
00:32:11.976 --> 00:32:14.597
We're not here to save the world or be martyrs,

855
00:32:14.597 --> 00:32:16.256
I mean that's the pisces innate.

856
00:32:16.256 --> 00:32:18.176
We're here to empower, wake up,

857
00:32:18.176 --> 00:32:19.936
and have a good time in the process,

858
00:32:19.936 --> 00:32:23.836
and the universe is, has every bit of

859
00:32:23.836 --> 00:32:27.196
intelligence to give us whatever it is we want.

860
00:32:27.196 --> 00:32:28.676
I mean, I study this stuff.

861
00:32:28.676 --> 00:32:31.257
I can go on about all these new energy technologies.

862
00:32:31.257 --> 00:32:34.396
Nanosolar technology, and they're all in the wings

863
00:32:34.396 --> 00:32:37.117
I call conscious capitalism, and these things will come

864
00:32:37.117 --> 00:32:40.236
to be, you know, integrated into the culture.

865
00:32:40.236 --> 00:32:42.856
But you have other forces, very strong economic forces,

866
00:32:42.856 --> 00:32:45.823
that want to maintain their market positions.

867
00:32:45.823 --> 00:32:48.823
And we have to come out with a program that's win-win,

868
00:32:48.823 --> 00:32:50.483
and the Light Party's total win-win.

869
00:32:50.483 --> 00:32:52.703
Everybody wins, health peace and freedom for all.
<v Interviewer>Let's talk about that</v>

870
00:32:52.703 --> 00:32:55.023
for a minute, this subject I've been interested

871
00:32:55.023 --> 00:32:57.604
in for a few years and aware of some of the technologies

872
00:32:57.604 --> 00:32:59.563
that already exist that remain suppressed.

873
00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.690
How do you make it a win-win?

874
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:07.210
Really pragmatically, you have the energy industries that

875
00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:10.104
exist, that have invested interest to see that they get

876
00:33:10.104 --> 00:33:11.523
to keep their market share.

877
00:33:11.523 --> 00:33:13.504
How do you make it a win-win, when you have other

878
00:33:13.504 --> 00:33:15.244
technologies that would--

879
00:33:15.244 --> 00:33:18.163
<v ->Good question, well it's the same thing with the drug companies.</v>

880
00:33:18.163 --> 00:33:23.163
Well what's happening, I read The Economist, one of my things.

881
00:33:23.383 --> 00:33:25.784
BP for example, is putting itself out as

882
00:33:25.784 --> 00:33:27.170
a new energy company.

883
00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:29.648
Now, how much of it's fluff and greenwashing,

884
00:33:29.648 --> 00:33:34.648
but they know that global warming is a real phenomenon.

885
00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:36.270
They also know because--

886
00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:38.309
<v Interviewer>They admitted it, they were the first oil company--</v>

887
00:33:38.309 --> 00:33:41.390
<v ->That we have a limited amount of oil,</v>

888
00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:44.150
which we're spending here in Iraq,

889
00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:45.909
about another 70 billion.

890
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:50.749
Basically to protect Middle Eastern oil fields,

891
00:33:50.749 --> 00:33:53.330
which is a commodity that's polluting the planet

892
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:54.990
out of existence, and the whole thing,

893
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:57.689
many objective analysis is insane.

894
00:33:57.689 --> 00:33:59.609
So, if you look at it go like,

895
00:33:59.609 --> 00:34:01.829
what could we do with 70 hundred billion dollars?

896
00:34:02.875 --> 00:34:04.056
<v Interviewer>A lot.</v>

897
00:34:04.056 --> 00:34:05.275
(laughing)

898
00:34:05.275 --> 00:34:07.555
<v ->Yeah, exactly, a lot, a lot.</v>

899
00:34:07.555 --> 00:34:10.575
Exactly, so we have basically these companies,

900
00:34:10.575 --> 00:34:13.275
for example. we just did a political action on Exon Mobile.

901
00:34:13.275 --> 00:34:15.116
It was a great flash animation, we're sending it out

902
00:34:15.116 --> 00:34:17.116
to about 200,000 people. which is

903
00:34:17.116 --> 00:34:19.696
an exposure of their whole policies

904
00:34:19.696 --> 00:34:23.196
and basically creating a boycott to Exon Mobile.

905
00:34:23.196 --> 00:34:24.996
I'm never gonna, you know, because they're

906
00:34:24.996 --> 00:34:28.115
notoriously non-alternative energy.

907
00:34:28.115 --> 00:34:30.676
It's one of the biggest companies on the planet.

908
00:34:30.676 --> 00:34:34.017
So as far as the suppression is concerned,

909
00:34:34.017 --> 00:34:37.136
I believe historically that that was yes,

910
00:34:37.136 --> 00:34:38.976
but I believe my understand is,

911
00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:42.135
and I'm talking to people who are doing amazing work.

912
00:34:42.135 --> 00:34:44.536
Not just in the philosophical level,

913
00:34:44.536 --> 00:34:46.856
cause that's the always thing I ask them.

914
00:34:46.856 --> 00:34:48.655
These new companies that are potentially trillion

915
00:34:48.655 --> 00:34:51.248
dollar companies, are you under political pressure,

916
00:34:51.248 --> 00:34:52.848
are you being threatened in any way?

917
00:34:52.848 --> 00:34:55.235
And the information I'm getting is that they're not.

918
00:34:55.235 --> 00:34:56.855
There's like a green light going on here.

919
00:34:56.855 --> 00:34:58.195
So, yes that's good news.

920
00:34:58.195 --> 00:34:59.674
<v Interviewer>That's huge.</v>

921
00:34:59.674 --> 00:35:03.755
<v ->Yeah, yeah, so I believe that because of the</v>

922
00:35:03.755 --> 00:35:06.495
consciousness shift, don't believe everything you see,

923
00:35:06.495 --> 00:35:07.174
it was that way.

924
00:35:07.174 --> 00:35:08.574
This is what David Ike will talk about.

925
00:35:08.574 --> 00:35:10.015
You know, everything's been suppressed

926
00:35:10.015 --> 00:35:11.815
and cancer cures, to this and that,

927
00:35:11.815 --> 00:35:13.635
and yeah, because it threatened

928
00:35:13.635 --> 00:35:15.975
the inherent market share of these companies.

929
00:35:15.975 --> 00:35:17.895
And they will do whatever they can,

930
00:35:17.895 --> 00:35:21.035
to the point of putting you six feet under.

931
00:35:21.035 --> 00:35:23.255
to protect their profits.

932
00:35:23.255 --> 00:35:27.852
Okay, however there's a company that'll get very specific.

933
00:35:28.742 --> 00:35:32.022
What these companies, they're not threatened at all.

934
00:35:32.022 --> 00:35:34.942
They have so much money they can either buy

935
00:35:34.942 --> 00:35:39.202
anybody out or buy up any new energy company,

936
00:35:40.348 --> 00:35:42.989
and you see this in the holistic health field.

937
00:35:42.989 --> 00:35:44.868
A lot of the pharmaceutical companies

938
00:35:44.868 --> 00:35:47.528
are buying companies that are putting

939
00:35:47.528 --> 00:35:48.795
out stuff that you see at Whole Foods.

940
00:35:48.795 --> 00:35:50.174
<v Interviewer>They're in the natural foods industry.</v>
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

941
00:35:50.174 --> 00:35:53.055
So they got one foot in one world,

942
00:35:53.055 --> 00:35:55.255
and they got another foot in another world.

943
00:35:55.255 --> 00:35:58.935
And ultimately though, as the consciousness transforms,

944
00:35:58.935 --> 00:36:01.555
they realize that thing is going ultimately

945
00:36:01.555 --> 00:36:03.502
to zero point, which means that

946
00:36:03.502 --> 00:36:07.022
the old paradigm about money and investors

947
00:36:07.022 --> 00:36:09.343
and making money, will ultimately come to an end,

948
00:36:09.343 --> 00:36:10.742
because we're talking about liberation,

949
00:36:12.582 --> 00:36:14.008
you know, at a fundamental level.

950
00:36:14.008 --> 00:36:16.869
<v Interviewer>Right, so it goes back to the consumer</v>

951
00:36:16.869 --> 00:36:20.147
to demand more conscious goods, services, etc.,

952
00:36:20.147 --> 00:36:22.588
in order for those who are hedging their bets

953
00:36:22.588 --> 00:36:24.669
who have massive holdings in the old

954
00:36:24.669 --> 00:36:26.908
paradigm, to really vest in the new.

955
00:36:26.908 --> 00:36:30.288
<v ->Well, you're seeing tremendous amounts</v>

956
00:36:30.288 --> 00:36:32.828
of money going into green energy technologies.

957
00:36:32.828 --> 00:36:33.828
Watch the money.

958
00:36:33.828 --> 00:36:34.448
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

959
00:36:34.448 --> 00:36:36.248
<v ->People, I mean, this is the future.</v>

960
00:36:36.248 --> 00:36:37.928
From wind and solar, for example,

961
00:36:37.928 --> 00:36:39.889
nanosolar technologies is one.

962
00:36:39.889 --> 00:36:41.808
I mean I could list about 20 companies,

963
00:36:41.808 --> 00:36:43.387
and I'm aware because I study this.

964
00:36:43.387 --> 00:36:45.108
Because I'm obviously here, I'm interested

965
00:36:45.108 --> 00:36:46.468
in this thing happening.

966
00:36:46.468 --> 00:36:49.448
You know, I want to see the whole thing change.

967
00:36:50.374 --> 00:36:53.994
The guys from Google bankrolled this company,

968
00:36:53.994 --> 00:36:55.941
and they have a technology, it's been written up,

969
00:36:55.941 --> 00:36:58.361
it was in the Chronicle, full page in the business section,

970
00:36:58.361 --> 00:37:00.261
two page article, they say within two years,

971
00:37:00.261 --> 00:37:01.601
they're completely gonna revolutionize

972
00:37:01.601 --> 00:37:03.681
solar energy technology.

973
00:37:03.681 --> 00:37:05.682
It's a spray on, it's a nanosolar.

974
00:37:05.682 --> 00:37:07.201
<v Interviewer>Yes, I've heard about this.</v>

975
00:37:07.201 --> 00:37:07.822
<v ->You've heard about this?</v>

976
00:37:07.822 --> 00:37:11.902
And they're just down the road here in Palo Alto.

977
00:37:11.902 --> 00:37:13.762
Now I'm in touch with a guy who's

978
00:37:13.762 --> 00:37:15.241
building what's called the Pap Engine.

979
00:37:15.241 --> 00:37:16.380
<v Interviewer>The what?</v>

980
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.822
<v ->Pap engine, it's not known.</v>

981
00:37:17.822 --> 00:37:18.741
<v Interviewer>Pap engine, I don't know that.</v>

982
00:37:18.741 --> 00:37:20.201
<v ->Now he's a guy, he's German,</v>

983
00:37:20.201 --> 00:37:22.562
he's a interesting guy, he's very German,

984
00:37:22.562 --> 00:37:24.981
and he's got this technology that's gonna

985
00:37:24.981 --> 00:37:27.680
change the whole world and he's very,

986
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.041
and he probably used to be part of the Vermar.

987
00:37:30.041 --> 00:37:31.662
<v Interviewer>Please share, what is this technology.</v>

988
00:37:31.662 --> 00:37:34.662
<v ->Well basically this thing was developed in the 70's.</v>

989
00:37:34.662 --> 00:37:37.081
It runs on a inertia, it only needs a very small

990
00:37:37.081 --> 00:37:41.301
amount of gasoline, and it catalyzes an internal

991
00:37:41.301 --> 00:37:44.061
combustion that runs for 10,000 hours.

992
00:37:44.061 --> 00:37:47.141
And they're workin' on it.

993
00:37:47.141 --> 00:37:49.901
They're still fine tuning the percentages,

994
00:37:49.901 --> 00:37:53.101
I don't understand the physics and the engineering of it,

995
00:37:53.101 --> 00:37:58.021
but it's basically the end of any type of oil shortage.

996
00:37:58.021 --> 00:38:00.573
I met a guy, I was invited, I've got lot's of contacts,

997
00:38:00.573 --> 00:38:02.635
and I met this guy, this woman said

998
00:38:02.635 --> 00:38:04.554
you've got to meet this guy, he's Chinese.

999
00:38:04.554 --> 00:38:06.014
I got to be friendly with him.

1000
00:38:06.014 --> 00:38:07.874
He's explained to me how everything works

1001
00:38:07.874 --> 00:38:10.914
in China, the power structure and the problems over there.

1002
00:38:10.914 --> 00:38:12.593
I'm very, I'm always--

1003
00:38:12.593 --> 00:38:13.214
<v Interviewer>You're global.</v>

1004
00:38:13.214 --> 00:38:14.634
<v ->Yeah, I just whatever.</v>

1005
00:38:14.634 --> 00:38:17.834
My life is completely unpredictable and things happen,

1006
00:38:17.834 --> 00:38:20.514
and I just become aware, as founder of the Light Party,

1007
00:38:20.514 --> 00:38:22.814
of all kinds of great stuff.

1008
00:38:22.814 --> 00:38:25.134
And it's a lot of stuff I find that's not so great.

1009
00:38:25.134 --> 00:38:26.814
You know what's goin' on behind

1010
00:38:26.814 --> 00:38:28.334
the scenes on the dark side.

1011
00:38:28.334 --> 00:38:30.854
So I'm aware of that as well.

1012
00:38:30.854 --> 00:38:32.994
So I meet this guy, he invites me to China,

1013
00:38:32.994 --> 00:38:36.434
he says I want this guy, he's from Beverly Hills.

1014
00:38:36.434 --> 00:38:38.734
It's called Green Energy Technology.

1015
00:38:38.734 --> 00:38:41.214
He pulls out, it's like a little coin.

1016
00:38:41.214 --> 00:38:46.214
Like a little button, and it's another nanotechnology.

1017
00:38:46.915 --> 00:38:51.475
These guys were with a team from

1018
00:38:51.475 --> 00:38:53.715
California Institute of Technology.

1019
00:38:53.715 --> 00:38:54.967
They put this, I don't know again exactly how they did it,

1020
00:38:54.967 --> 00:38:56.589
they put it somewhere in the engine,

1021
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:59.347
it completely reformulates the

1022
00:39:00.555 --> 00:39:03.035
gasoline to be zero pollution.

1023
00:39:03.035 --> 00:39:03.974
<v Interviewer>Yes, I've seen these.</v>

1024
00:39:03.974 --> 00:39:08.974
<v ->And it doubles the mileage of the gasoline.</v>

1025
00:39:10.719 --> 00:39:12.085
So they're building a plan of this in China,

1026
00:39:12.085 --> 00:39:14.045
cause China has phenomenal environmental problems,

1027
00:39:14.045 --> 00:39:15.266
we can't even.

1028
00:39:15.266 --> 00:39:17.946
And then there's this other stuff that I just read

1029
00:39:17.946 --> 00:39:20.483
in Christian Science Monitor, a form of algae,

1030
00:39:20.483 --> 00:39:22.163
which is very exciting.

1031
00:39:22.163 --> 00:39:23.903
That not only will clean out all the coal,

1032
00:39:23.903 --> 00:39:28.263
you know algae is a natural, from a biological level,

1033
00:39:28.263 --> 00:39:30.883
kelates heavy metals, you know like Chloral,

1034
00:39:30.883 --> 00:39:31.843
you know about this?

1035
00:39:31.843 --> 00:39:32.482
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

1036
00:39:32.482 --> 00:39:34.723
<v ->So these guys from MIT, young guys came up</v>

1037
00:39:34.723 --> 00:39:36.635
with this plan to use algae to clean algae

1038
00:39:36.635 --> 00:39:38.235
to clean out the smoke stacks,

1039
00:39:38.235 --> 00:39:40.575
However, they also found out,

1040
00:39:40.575 --> 00:39:43.415
this is like a complete, totally holistic

1041
00:39:43.415 --> 00:39:46.455
integrated energy system, that's 15,000 square

1042
00:39:46.455 --> 00:39:49.794
miles of, they grew algae ponds,

1043
00:39:49.794 --> 00:39:54.154
which supply all the biofuel for the United States.

1044
00:39:54.154 --> 00:39:56.695
It's, I don't have the statistics in front of me,

1045
00:39:56.695 --> 00:40:01.695
but it was something like soy will produce, corn will produce

1046
00:40:01.915 --> 00:40:04.456
60 gallons per whatever.

1047
00:40:04.456 --> 00:40:07.997
This is like 50 times more efficient.

1048
00:40:08.003 --> 00:40:09.683
So these guys have come up with the holes

1049
00:40:09.683 --> 00:40:12.303
of putting this in the Senora Desert in Arizona

1050
00:40:12.303 --> 00:40:13.983
to grow algae ponds,

1051
00:40:13.983 --> 00:40:16.783
they'll grow phenomenal amounts of ethanol.

1052
00:40:16.783 --> 00:40:19.123
And this again has been written up,

1053
00:40:19.123 --> 00:40:20.703
I have this, I keep reporting.

1054
00:40:20.703 --> 00:40:23.923
So you see these things, there's lots of people

1055
00:40:23.923 --> 00:40:26.743
working on the energy story.

1056
00:40:26.743 --> 00:40:28.383
<v Interviewer>So we're really sitting on the cusp.</v>

1057
00:40:28.383 --> 00:40:29.623
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

1058
00:40:29.623 --> 00:40:33.659
Yeah, and, yeah, absolutely.

1059
00:40:33.659 --> 00:40:36.119
So, you know, these breakthroughs are happening,

1060
00:40:36.119 --> 00:40:38.619
and then there's the whole thing with cold fusion.

1061
00:40:38.619 --> 00:40:40.679
Which I'm a firm believer in,

1062
00:40:40.679 --> 00:40:43.919
and the guy, he actually was murdered,

1063
00:40:43.919 --> 00:40:45.399
Gene Malov, I don't know if you knew about

1064
00:40:45.399 --> 00:40:47.959
the guy who Infinite Energy magazine.

1065
00:40:47.959 --> 00:40:49.599
<v Interviewer>No I don't know the magazine</v>

1066
00:40:49.599 --> 00:40:51.238
but I heard that he was murdered, yes.

1067
00:40:51.238 --> 00:40:52.379
<v ->Yeah, Gene and I were,</v>

1068
00:40:52.379 --> 00:40:55.478
it wasn't CIA, I knew Gene

1069
00:40:55.478 --> 00:40:57.379
I won't get into what happened with Gene

1070
00:40:57.379 --> 00:40:58.198
a lot of people believe,

1071
00:40:58.198 --> 00:40:59.759
but he was a close friend,

1072
00:40:59.759 --> 00:41:01.598
he was my energy guru.

1073
00:41:01.598 --> 00:41:03.339
And he was always researching,

1074
00:41:03.339 --> 00:41:04.699
he was in New Hampshire,

1075
00:41:04.699 --> 00:41:06.579
the latest and the greatest of what's happening

1076
00:41:06.579 --> 00:41:09.178
in zero point energy, he was like a Good Housekeeping

1077
00:41:09.178 --> 00:41:11.938
seal of approval, and he'd heard all these different

1078
00:41:11.938 --> 00:41:14.139
stories about what was real, what was not real,

1079
00:41:14.139 --> 00:41:15.458
and I called, I said,

1080
00:41:15.458 --> 00:41:16.300
"Gene what's the latest?"

1081
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.939
And he would say, "There's black light power,

1082
00:41:17.939 --> 00:41:19.380
"you wanna check out this one and then

1083
00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:20.619
"there's this one and then there's that one."

1084
00:41:20.619 --> 00:41:23.699
And, I was always saying to him,

1085
00:41:23.699 --> 00:41:25.879
'cause he knew I had a strong spiritual awareness,

1086
00:41:25.879 --> 00:41:28.458
I said, "Cold fusion will happen when there's

1087
00:41:28.458 --> 00:41:30.739
"a consciousness shift and a vibrational change.

1088
00:41:30.739 --> 00:41:31.978
"What you are seeing."

1089
00:41:31.978 --> 00:41:33.059
'Cause he was very angry, he said,

1090
00:41:33.059 --> 00:41:35.279
"Why don't they listen to me?

1091
00:41:35.279 --> 00:41:38.079
"We've got the solution, and why don't they back it?"

1092
00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:40.199
I said, "Don't take it so personally."

1093
00:41:40.199 --> 00:41:41.659
But he was a very angry guy because

1094
00:41:41.659 --> 00:41:45.359
he felt he had the keys to whatever.

1095
00:41:45.359 --> 00:41:48.159
And he wasn't getting supported for it.

1096
00:41:48.159 --> 00:41:49.699
But I always said it was a timing thing

1097
00:41:49.699 --> 00:41:51.179
and it was a consciousness thing.

1098
00:41:51.179 --> 00:41:52.459
And there'd be bleed throughs,

1099
00:41:52.459 --> 00:41:54.279
they were picking up bleed throughs.

1100
00:41:55.376 --> 00:41:57.076
From other dimensions.

1101
00:41:57.076 --> 00:41:58.696
But the consciousness and the planet

1102
00:41:58.696 --> 00:42:01.256
had not reached that level where this would become

1103
00:42:02.072 --> 00:42:04.123
zero point.

1104
00:42:04.933 --> 00:42:06.492
To bring this in, now the same thing,

1105
00:42:06.492 --> 00:42:08.932
another thing for example, holistic health

1106
00:42:08.932 --> 00:42:10.653
which is really my strong point.

1107
00:42:10.653 --> 00:42:11.773
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

1108
00:42:11.773 --> 00:42:13.953
<v ->You've got companies that you'd be amazed</v>

1109
00:42:13.953 --> 00:42:16.233
at a lot of what these big companies

1110
00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:18.313
who were the pharmaceutical companies

1111
00:42:18.313 --> 00:42:20.613
that I would say 90% of what the pharmaceutical

1112
00:42:20.613 --> 00:42:23.793
companies put out is dangerous, expensive,

1113
00:42:23.793 --> 00:42:25.493
and it's ineffective.

1114
00:42:25.493 --> 00:42:26.313
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

1115
00:42:26.313 --> 00:42:27.953
<v ->I wrote about this stuff in the '70s,</v>

1116
00:42:27.953 --> 00:42:30.453
I mean, it's not to say it's all garbage,

1117
00:42:30.453 --> 00:42:31.913
but 90% of it is.

1118
00:42:33.006 --> 00:42:34.226
It's useless, it's dangerous,

1119
00:42:34.226 --> 00:42:36.125
we can look at the whole thing

1120
00:42:36.125 --> 00:42:38.026
about AIDS, HIV AIDS,

1121
00:42:38.026 --> 00:42:40.426
there's the pharmaceutical,

1122
00:42:40.426 --> 00:42:41.366
what was that great movie,

1123
00:42:41.366 --> 00:42:42.365
The Constant Gardener?

1124
00:42:42.365 --> 00:42:43.366
<v Interviewer>Constant Gardener, yes.</v>

1125
00:42:43.366 --> 00:42:44.225
<v ->Yeah, that was a good film,</v>

1126
00:42:44.225 --> 00:42:45.526
that was a good expose.

1127
00:42:45.526 --> 00:42:47.446
So you have all these other ways of treating

1128
00:42:47.446 --> 00:42:51.166
diseases, homeopathy, nutritionally,

1129
00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.200
herbs, I mean so on and so forth.

1130
00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.920
But these companies, when these companies

1131
00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.600
start getting big, they'll buy 'em out.

1132
00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.140
So I would be very interested to see

1133
00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.260
who owns what.

1134
00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.441
<v Interviewer>Yes I would be too,</v>

1135
00:43:02.441 --> 00:43:04.440
I've wondered what's going on behind the scenes

1136
00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.400
with this, I know there've been an awful lot of

1137
00:43:07.465 --> 00:43:11.867
very angry inventors in the last decade

1138
00:43:11.867 --> 00:43:13.567
or two that--
<v DaVid>Well sure, frustration.</v>

1139
00:43:13.567 --> 00:43:15.366
<v Interviewer>Yes, frustration, because they do have</v>

1140
00:43:15.366 --> 00:43:17.345
pieces of the answer, but what you said

1141
00:43:17.345 --> 00:43:18.646
I think is key.

1142
00:43:18.646 --> 00:43:21.126
Some of these more exotic technologies can be used

1143
00:43:21.126 --> 00:43:24.303
in many ways, and it would seem that to

1144
00:43:24.303 --> 00:43:26.823
have a good grasp on our own

1145
00:43:26.823 --> 00:43:29.363
evolution of our own consciousness might be

1146
00:43:29.363 --> 00:43:31.123
in order

1147
00:43:31.123 --> 00:43:35.823
before we start outing some of these technologies too.

1148
00:43:35.823 --> 00:43:37.383
<v ->Oh absolutely, yeah.</v>

1149
00:43:37.383 --> 00:43:38.642
<v Interviewer>So I'm just saying,</v>

1150
00:43:38.642 --> 00:43:40.783
I totally see what you were saying to your friend

1151
00:43:40.783 --> 00:43:43.243
about this, that we're just getting

1152
00:43:43.243 --> 00:43:44.823
to the point where we might be ready

1153
00:43:44.823 --> 00:43:46.783
to be able to responsibly utilize.

1154
00:43:46.783 --> 00:43:48.683
<v ->Right exactly, there's a timing to everything,</v>

1155
00:43:48.683 --> 00:43:52.483
I mean, there is actually a timing to things,

1156
00:43:52.483 --> 00:43:55.443
and to bring in unlimited clean energy,

1157
00:43:55.443 --> 00:43:57.222
even five years ago would be,

1158
00:43:57.222 --> 00:43:59.242
it's called disruptive technologies.

1159
00:43:59.242 --> 00:44:00.703
There has to be a transitional phase,

1160
00:44:00.703 --> 00:44:03.590
because this whole oil-based economy

1161
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:05.250
you go look what it has spawned

1162
00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:07.589
beside the fact that the oil that you pump in,

1163
00:44:07.589 --> 00:44:10.523
you've got all the auto parts and you've got the this

1164
00:44:10.523 --> 00:44:13.023
and that, you've got millions of people

1165
00:44:13.023 --> 00:44:15.164
whose whole lives are dependent on

1166
00:44:15.164 --> 00:44:16.983
oil-based economy.

1167
00:44:16.983 --> 00:44:19.203
Same thing with the military industrial complex.

1168
00:44:19.203 --> 00:44:21.383
Every time they try to make a cut,

1169
00:44:21.383 --> 00:44:23.703
it's not in my back yard.

1170
00:44:23.703 --> 00:44:26.216
When I was running, I'll give you a very clear example,

1171
00:44:26.216 --> 00:44:28.536
the economics of it.

1172
00:44:28.536 --> 00:44:30.376
I was running in '92,

1173
00:44:30.376 --> 00:44:32.316
and Jerry Brown was running,

1174
00:44:32.316 --> 00:44:33.975
and one of the big issues was

1175
00:44:33.975 --> 00:44:35.256
it was all pork barrel.

1176
00:44:35.256 --> 00:44:37.535
I mean if you study the

1177
00:44:37.535 --> 00:44:41.456
budgets it's 50% pork barrel stuff.

1178
00:44:41.456 --> 00:44:43.336
We've gotta create enemies to justify the

1179
00:44:43.336 --> 00:44:46.176
continued existence of the military industrial complex.

1180
00:44:46.176 --> 00:44:49.316
So they wanted to build another super submarine

1181
00:44:49.316 --> 00:44:50.936
in New Haven, Connecticut.

1182
00:44:50.936 --> 00:44:52.876
Two, three billion dollar submarine,

1183
00:44:52.876 --> 00:44:55.295
and we needed this like another hole in my head,

1184
00:44:55.295 --> 00:44:58.336
unnecessary, and they wanted to cut it,

1185
00:44:58.336 --> 00:45:01.336
ax it, and had they done that,

1186
00:45:01.336 --> 00:45:04.875
they would've thrown 20,000 people out of work, so--

1187
00:45:04.875 --> 00:45:07.056
<v Interviewer>Right, these are very real</v>

1188
00:45:07.056 --> 00:45:09.216
concerns, so how do you,

1189
00:45:09.216 --> 00:45:11.735
okay we've talked about the energy industry a bit

1190
00:45:11.735 --> 00:45:13.676
and you're feeling pretty--

1191
00:45:13.676 --> 00:45:14.575
<v ->You have to create a vision.</v>

1192
00:45:14.575 --> 00:45:15.776
<v Interviewer>Create a vision, right--</v>

1193
00:45:15.776 --> 00:45:16.796
<v ->In other words, we can say,</v>

1194
00:45:16.796 --> 00:45:18.817
"Look, like a Manhattan Project or a new deal."

1195
00:45:18.817 --> 00:45:21.375
And saying, "Look, we're in a transitional phase,

1196
00:45:21.375 --> 00:45:23.116
"and we can create a world that works

1197
00:45:23.116 --> 00:45:25.296
"for everybody, clean environment, unlimited this."

1198
00:45:25.296 --> 00:45:27.676
We have to sell and market

1199
00:45:27.676 --> 00:45:30.435
a possibility of a better future for everybody.

1200
00:45:30.435 --> 00:45:32.755
And we're in this transitional phase.

1201
00:45:32.755 --> 00:45:34.656
One thing you can't all of the sudden just

1202
00:45:34.656 --> 00:45:37.376
cut one thing out and put the other thing in,

1203
00:45:37.376 --> 00:45:40.115
one thing is going out, and the other thing

1204
00:45:40.115 --> 00:45:41.235
is coming in.

1205
00:45:41.235 --> 00:45:43.816
<v Interviewer>Right, and I think that tends to be</v>

1206
00:45:43.816 --> 00:45:45.755
the discouraging factor to a lot of people--

1207
00:45:45.755 --> 00:45:46.955
<v ->It's the speed.
<v Interviewer>Who are</v>

1208
00:45:46.955 --> 00:45:48.135
looking to the change is the speed of it.

1209
00:45:48.135 --> 00:45:50.015
And people's sides tend to become

1210
00:45:50.015 --> 00:45:51.695
very dogmatic and not understanding

1211
00:45:51.695 --> 00:45:53.376
that there are pragmatic issues

1212
00:45:53.376 --> 00:45:55.815
that need to be considered here.

1213
00:45:55.815 --> 00:45:57.323
<v ->People are working for the drug companies</v>

1214
00:45:57.323 --> 00:45:59.341
all of the sudden, if they all bellied up tomorrow

1215
00:45:59.341 --> 00:46:01.783
you'd have tons of people out of work.

1216
00:46:01.783 --> 00:46:02.822
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

1217
00:46:02.822 --> 00:46:04.103
<v ->So you go to a company like</v>

1218
00:46:04.103 --> 00:46:06.263
Pharmacia, you know that?

1219
00:46:06.263 --> 00:46:07.883
<v Interviewer>Pharmaca?</v>

1220
00:46:07.883 --> 00:46:09.003
<v ->Pharmaca yeah.</v>

1221
00:46:09.003 --> 00:46:10.063
<v Interviewer>Pharmaca I love that place.</v>

1222
00:46:10.063 --> 00:46:11.422
<v ->Yeah so they've got the</v>

1223
00:46:11.422 --> 00:46:14.463
pharmacy stuff, and then they got the other stuff,

1224
00:46:14.463 --> 00:46:16.002
and that's good, so--

1225
00:46:16.002 --> 00:46:17.763
<v Interviewer>It's called an integrative pharmacy.</v>

1226
00:46:17.763 --> 00:46:19.642
<v ->Yeah, it's good, 'cause they know,</v>

1227
00:46:19.642 --> 00:46:23.043
people know that people are disenchanted with

1228
00:46:23.043 --> 00:46:25.322
holistic, allopathic medicine.

1229
00:46:25.322 --> 00:46:28.103
It's symptomatic, it's superficial,

1230
00:46:28.103 --> 00:46:30.103
so people are looking for stuff that works.

1231
00:46:30.103 --> 00:46:31.202
<v Interviewer>So really if you take it</v>

1232
00:46:31.202 --> 00:46:34.083
in a very simple sense, say you have

1233
00:46:34.083 --> 00:46:36.542
a bronchial infection and your doctor just given you

1234
00:46:36.542 --> 00:46:39.303
an antibiotic for it, at the same time you pick up

1235
00:46:39.303 --> 00:46:42.003
your immune system boosting vitamins,

1236
00:46:42.003 --> 00:46:44.742
and this kind of solution is really the beginning

1237
00:46:44.742 --> 00:46:48.883
of the transition, is these simple day by day choices.

1238
00:46:48.883 --> 00:46:51.443
<v ->Well, it's all a matter of providing other choices,</v>

1239
00:46:51.443 --> 00:46:54.643
and education, it's all fundamental education.

1240
00:46:54.643 --> 00:46:56.923
I mean antibiotics, now a friend of mine

1241
00:46:56.923 --> 00:46:58.842
whose wife who I actually do videos with

1242
00:46:58.842 --> 00:47:00.383
is a doctor, and she's very straight,

1243
00:47:00.383 --> 00:47:01.802
from my perspective.

1244
00:47:01.802 --> 00:47:03.583
And her kids got an ear infection,

1245
00:47:03.583 --> 00:47:04.883
so they're gonna give her all kinds of

1246
00:47:04.883 --> 00:47:08.163
antibiotics, and I talked to Jessie S., I said,

1247
00:47:08.163 --> 00:47:09.263
"Make sure that

1248
00:47:09.263 --> 00:47:13.063
"the kid takes lactobacillus acidophilus

1249
00:47:13.063 --> 00:47:14.203
"because it's gonna wipe out the."

1250
00:47:14.203 --> 00:47:15.842
Said, "Well, my wife doesn't believe in this kind

1251
00:47:15.842 --> 00:47:16.783
"of stuff."

1252
00:47:16.783 --> 00:47:20.683
And I said, "Jessie, do some research."

1253
00:47:20.683 --> 00:47:22.883
You know, so there it is--

1254
00:47:22.883 --> 00:47:25.262
<v Interviewer>But it's these simple little beginning points</v>

1255
00:47:25.262 --> 00:47:29.083
for people, we're afraid to unplug from what's known.

1256
00:47:29.083 --> 00:47:30.542
<v ->Because we're invested in it.</v>

1257
00:47:30.542 --> 00:47:31.623
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

1258
00:47:31.623 --> 00:47:32.842
<v ->You're an allopathic doctor,</v>

1259
00:47:32.842 --> 00:47:34.143
you've spent your whole life,

1260
00:47:34.143 --> 00:47:35.803
you know I slipped through the cracks,

1261
00:47:35.803 --> 00:47:37.802
believe me, I'd be singing a different tune here

1262
00:47:37.802 --> 00:47:40.642
if I had a mortgage and I had...

1263
00:47:40.642 --> 00:47:43.222
I was indebted into,

1264
00:47:43.222 --> 00:47:46.063
once a doctor gets out of medical school

1265
00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:47.563
they're up to their eyeballs in debt.

1266
00:47:47.563 --> 00:47:49.363
They got ya by the gazorts.

1267
00:47:49.363 --> 00:47:50.082
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

1268
00:47:50.082 --> 00:47:52.242
<v ->It didn't happen to me, I had a lot of freedom,</v>

1269
00:47:52.242 --> 00:47:54.063
I slipped through the cracks.

1270
00:47:54.063 --> 00:47:57.442
I was not owned, I got that through

1271
00:47:57.442 --> 00:47:59.110
a British medical school, so these guys

1272
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.289
you go through four years of medical school

1273
00:48:01.289 --> 00:48:03.790
and you go through this intense training

1274
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:06.970
and you come out beholden in debt.

1275
00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:08.209
So you gotta get back to work

1276
00:48:08.209 --> 00:48:10.770
and you've been trained to be basically a pill pusher.

1277
00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:11.809
<v Interviewer>Mm hmm.</v>

1278
00:48:11.809 --> 00:48:13.809
<v ->And you're beholden to the drug companies,</v>

1279
00:48:13.809 --> 00:48:15.590
drug companies own the medical schools.

1280
00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:18.770
They give lip service, and they're studying alternative

1281
00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:21.070
medicine, but they're basic come from the places,

1282
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:22.670
we're writing this other stuff,

1283
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:25.770
you gotta prove that this stuff

1284
00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:26.950
has validity.

1285
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:28.389
It's like the joke, I get a kick out of it,

1286
00:48:28.389 --> 00:48:30.410
they have studies a sign it's good,

1287
00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:32.189
'cause it substantiates truth.

1288
00:48:32.189 --> 00:48:33.510
For example, they come with a study

1289
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:34.989
they say, "Exercise is good for you."

1290
00:48:34.989 --> 00:48:35.869
You know?

1291
00:48:35.869 --> 00:48:37.010
<v Interviewer>Okay.</v>

1292
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:38.270
<v ->Sunlight's good for ya.</v>

1293
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:41.529
There's something to good nutrition,

1294
00:48:41.529 --> 00:48:42.410
you know it's like,

1295
00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:45.089
yeah well of course, but science,

1296
00:48:45.089 --> 00:48:46.789
and they'll do these--

1297
00:48:46.789 --> 00:48:48.810
<v Interviewer>I read it in Red Book, right.</v>

1298
00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:50.829
<v ->They'll do these intensive study,</v>

1299
00:48:50.829 --> 00:48:52.749
it keeps people busy with their lives,

1300
00:48:52.749 --> 00:48:55.009
and I used to say for depression,

1301
00:48:55.009 --> 00:48:57.670
yeah there's a biochem, the best thing to do

1302
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:59.529
when you're depressed is exercise,

1303
00:48:59.529 --> 00:49:01.529
'cause it has to do with oxygen.

1304
00:49:01.529 --> 00:49:02.830
<v Interviewer>What about detoxification?</v>

1305
00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:04.790
<v ->Absolutely key, yeah.</v>

1306
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:07.210
And then there's the balancing of the brain chemistry

1307
00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:09.910
and the serotonin levels, and there are natural substances

1308
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:12.550
that if you have your amino acids, and if you

1309
00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:15.450
B complex, this is orthomolecular medicine

1310
00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:18.330
which is a huge field, orthomolecular psychiatry,

1311
00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:21.810
where assuring that schizophrenia, manic depression,

1312
00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:24.370
these things all have a biochemical correlation

1313
00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:26.150
that can be treated very effectively

1314
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:28.070
through nutritional awareness.

1315
00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:29.870
<v Interviewer>Well your HMO is not going to provide</v>

1316
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:31.769
for that however, for the most part.

1317
00:49:31.769 --> 00:49:32.730
<v ->You got to take care of yourself.</v>

1318
00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:35.089
<v Interviewer>Exactly, so you touched on this</v>

1319
00:49:35.089 --> 00:49:37.310
a little while ago that universal healthcare,

1320
00:49:38.807 --> 00:49:40.267
what do you see on the horizon

1321
00:49:40.267 --> 00:49:42.748
that has some glimmer of hope for

1322
00:49:42.748 --> 00:49:45.007
those of us who really would choose to tailor

1323
00:49:45.007 --> 00:49:48.027
our own kind of health coverage to our needs.

1324
00:49:48.027 --> 00:49:50.728
<v ->Well the first thing is to fully educate yourself,</v>

1325
00:49:50.728 --> 00:49:52.867
and with the internet today, because it's a double-edged

1326
00:49:52.867 --> 00:49:54.567
sword, there's so much information out there,

1327
00:49:54.567 --> 00:49:56.007
and there's so many products promising

1328
00:49:56.007 --> 00:49:58.428
the sun, the moon, and the stars right?

1329
00:49:58.428 --> 00:50:00.687
The basic things are to educate

1330
00:50:02.173 --> 00:50:03.734
really take responsibility for your health,

1331
00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:05.613
create a lifestyle if you can,

1332
00:50:05.613 --> 00:50:07.321
where you're supporting.

1333
00:50:07.321 --> 00:50:09.161
Again, like I said, exercise,

1334
00:50:09.161 --> 00:50:12.241
proper nutrition, and maintain that wellness

1335
00:50:12.241 --> 00:50:15.087
state of being.

1336
00:50:15.087 --> 00:50:16.767
And at the same time,

1337
00:50:16.767 --> 00:50:19.287
you know, maybe get catastrophic insurance,

1338
00:50:19.287 --> 00:50:21.227
I mean that's the,

1339
00:50:21.227 --> 00:50:23.887
but understand that if you do the basic stuff

1340
00:50:23.887 --> 00:50:25.668
that you can stay healthy and strong

1341
00:50:25.668 --> 00:50:27.507
well into your 80s and 90s

1342
00:50:27.507 --> 00:50:29.507
as science is now showing this.

1343
00:50:29.507 --> 00:50:31.087
And that's not even involving all this

1344
00:50:31.087 --> 00:50:32.847
consciousness in DNA.

1345
00:50:32.847 --> 00:50:33.828
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

1346
00:50:33.828 --> 00:50:36.447
<v ->That we were not meant to have a breakdown</v>

1347
00:50:36.447 --> 00:50:38.267
by the time we're 50 or 60, this is just a

1348
00:50:38.267 --> 00:50:40.287
belief system, an image that has been

1349
00:50:40.287 --> 00:50:42.188
impressed into our consciousness

1350
00:50:42.188 --> 00:50:43.868
that by the time you're 50 or whatever,

1351
00:50:43.868 --> 00:50:47.068
you're ready for your breakdown or you're 60.

1352
00:50:47.068 --> 00:50:49.247
In fact most of the healthcare costs

1353
00:50:49.247 --> 00:50:50.926
and where the drug companies make their money

1354
00:50:50.926 --> 00:50:52.267
is in the last five years,

1355
00:50:52.267 --> 00:50:54.568
this is where people are going bankrupt,

1356
00:50:54.568 --> 00:50:56.527
or you're healthy to a certain point

1357
00:50:56.527 --> 00:50:57.368
and then you have some

1358
00:50:57.368 --> 00:50:59.108
you know you've got a dementia going on

1359
00:50:59.108 --> 00:51:00.927
or you got a stroke or you got a heart attack,

1360
00:51:00.927 --> 00:51:02.647
and a friend of mine,

1361
00:51:02.647 --> 00:51:06.548
the costs are just absolutely astronomical.

1362
00:51:06.548 --> 00:51:09.407
Good friend of mine had a liver transplant,

1363
00:51:09.407 --> 00:51:12.167
he managed to get one, I won't go into that,

1364
00:51:12.167 --> 00:51:15.327
$750,000, I joked,

1365
00:51:15.327 --> 00:51:16.267
I said when he got the bill

1366
00:51:16.267 --> 00:51:18.087
'cause a lot of it was paid by the MediCal,

1367
00:51:18.087 --> 00:51:21.408
but they still stuck him with $250,000 bill,

1368
00:51:21.408 --> 00:51:23.961
I joked when he got his bill he died

1369
00:51:23.961 --> 00:51:25.121
of a heart attack, you know.

1370
00:51:25.121 --> 00:51:28.100
(laughing)

1371
00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:29.561
<v Interviewer>It's true though, we shouldn't have to be</v>

1372
00:51:29.561 --> 00:51:31.141
held hostage to this.

1373
00:51:31.141 --> 00:51:32.860
So, again--

1374
00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:33.720
<v ->Everybody, everybody.</v>

1375
00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:35.380
<v Interviewer>Take responsibility, educate yourself,</v>

1376
00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:38.581
begin living simply a healthier type of lifestyle,

1377
00:51:38.581 --> 00:51:40.840
and then catastrophic, is that how you

1378
00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.581
would do it for most people?

1379
00:51:42.581 --> 00:51:45.360
Keep a little catastrophic insurance just in case

1380
00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.407
you're gonna get whacked in a car?

1381
00:51:46.407 --> 00:51:47.946
<v ->Yeah, 'cause you know, we're not super masters yet</v>

1382
00:51:47.946 --> 00:51:49.407
I mean stuff happens, you know what they say

1383
00:51:49.407 --> 00:51:50.247
shit happens.

1384
00:51:50.247 --> 00:51:50.767
<v Interviewer>Good.</v>

1385
00:51:50.767 --> 00:51:52.067
<v ->I mean, right?</v>

1386
00:51:52.067 --> 00:51:53.887
Car accident, or--

1387
00:51:53.887 --> 00:51:55.087
<v Interviewer>Because a lot of people were talking about</v>

1388
00:51:55.087 --> 00:51:57.687
unplugging from the system, especially if you're

1389
00:51:57.687 --> 00:51:59.907
paying four $500 a month for a person.

1390
00:51:59.907 --> 00:52:03.234
<v ->It ultimately comes down to how you define yourself,</v>

1391
00:52:03.234 --> 00:52:06.513
if you can fully say, "I am healthy

1392
00:52:06.513 --> 00:52:08.174
"in mind body and soul,

1393
00:52:08.174 --> 00:52:10.334
"and I embrace my perfection,

1394
00:52:10.334 --> 00:52:11.733
"or embrace that I am."

1395
00:52:11.733 --> 00:52:13.753
And you're working with your consciousness,

1396
00:52:13.753 --> 00:52:15.454
and again, it's an experiment,

1397
00:52:15.454 --> 00:52:18.234
and you're not plugged into an entropic system.

1398
00:52:18.234 --> 00:52:20.954
Because when you buy insurance on some level

1399
00:52:20.954 --> 00:52:23.174
subconsciously you're betting against yourself.

1400
00:52:23.174 --> 00:52:24.834
There's a certain belief that

1401
00:52:24.834 --> 00:52:28.892
you gotta be strong in your awareness.

1402
00:52:28.892 --> 00:52:30.652
I have accounts of a lot of people

1403
00:52:30.652 --> 00:52:32.112
who had cancer,

1404
00:52:32.112 --> 00:52:34.472
and I always get to their belief systems.

1405
00:52:34.472 --> 00:52:36.451
And some people, when the rubber hits the road

1406
00:52:36.451 --> 00:52:38.311
they're gonna run right back into the allopathic

1407
00:52:38.311 --> 00:52:39.611
monologue, get their mastectomy,

1408
00:52:39.611 --> 00:52:41.951
and they'll get their chemo, and they know

1409
00:52:41.951 --> 00:52:44.011
they don't really wanna do it, but they're afraid,

1410
00:52:44.011 --> 00:52:45.552
because their life is on the line.

1411
00:52:45.552 --> 00:52:47.491
Is this other system really going to

1412
00:52:47.491 --> 00:52:50.072
provide them with the alternative,

1413
00:52:50.072 --> 00:52:51.991
and people go to Mexico, or they go to Europe

1414
00:52:51.991 --> 00:52:53.771
seeking alternatives.

1415
00:52:53.771 --> 00:52:55.732
So it's easier said than done when

1416
00:52:55.732 --> 00:52:57.691
you're faced with it.

1417
00:52:57.691 --> 00:52:59.972
But the reason I have a strong standing

1418
00:52:59.972 --> 00:53:01.232
is 'cause I'm very educated,

1419
00:53:01.232 --> 00:53:03.011
I mean my doctor's a chiropractor.

1420
00:53:03.011 --> 00:53:04.311
He's an Ayurvedic,

1421
00:53:04.311 --> 00:53:06.311
and he's great, and he does muscle testing.

1422
00:53:06.311 --> 00:53:09.530
And he works on emotional issues.

1423
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:12.112
And he's a really good chiropractor,

1424
00:53:12.112 --> 00:53:14.732
and I see him maybe once every

1425
00:53:14.732 --> 00:53:16.472
three four just to check in.

1426
00:53:16.472 --> 00:53:17.811
But I take care of myself,

1427
00:53:17.811 --> 00:53:19.652
I have the time, fortunately,

1428
00:53:19.652 --> 00:53:22.411
where I have the luxury, it's a priority for me

1429
00:53:22.411 --> 00:53:26.491
to keep my consciousness and my health good.

1430
00:53:26.491 --> 00:53:28.332
But it's something I work on.

1431
00:53:28.332 --> 00:53:29.492
<v Interviewer>Yeah--</v>

1432
00:53:29.492 --> 00:53:31.932
<v ->And in this society that where</v>

1433
00:53:31.932 --> 00:53:34.212
people are under tremendous stress just to survive

1434
00:53:34.212 --> 00:53:36.431
you don't have that luxury, so there's a breakdown.

1435
00:53:36.431 --> 00:53:38.052
<v Interviewer>So how do you address that?</v>

1436
00:53:38.052 --> 00:53:40.132
You're a person who has a couple of kids

1437
00:53:40.132 --> 00:53:41.952
and a mortgage, and you're up to the

1438
00:53:41.952 --> 00:53:44.591
you know in debt.
<v DaVid>Yeah, it's tough.</v>

1439
00:53:44.591 --> 00:53:46.172
<v Interviewer>Now, how do you begin constructing</v>

1440
00:53:46.172 --> 00:53:48.671
this kind of aesthetic conscious

1441
00:53:48.671 --> 00:53:50.912
fully aware and responsible lifestyle?

1442
00:53:50.912 --> 00:53:52.391
<v ->You start where you're at.</v>

1443
00:53:52.391 --> 00:53:54.452
You gotta take inventory.

1444
00:53:54.452 --> 00:53:55.332
You've gotta say,

1445
00:53:55.332 --> 00:53:56.671
"Look, I'm the most important,

1446
00:53:56.671 --> 00:53:57.912
"most important person.

1447
00:53:57.912 --> 00:54:00.671
"My family and my business depends on my

1448
00:54:00.671 --> 00:54:02.811
"being healthy, so I've gotta take out that

1449
00:54:02.811 --> 00:54:05.251
"which no longer is supporting me."

1450
00:54:05.251 --> 00:54:07.591
And you gotta make that commitment.

1451
00:54:07.591 --> 00:54:09.672
And then you start inventorying your life.

1452
00:54:09.672 --> 00:54:11.872
What's my diet like, am I getting exercise?

1453
00:54:11.872 --> 00:54:13.972
These little things, get a good chiropractor.

1454
00:54:13.972 --> 00:54:16.831
Be willing to spend money on yourself

1455
00:54:16.831 --> 00:54:18.091
and to simplify your life.

1456
00:54:18.091 --> 00:54:21.071
That's the paradigm if I may say so,

1457
00:54:21.071 --> 00:54:22.805
people in the spiritual path.

1458
00:54:22.805 --> 00:54:24.885
When people become spiritually awake

1459
00:54:24.885 --> 00:54:26.565
or being to move the path,

1460
00:54:26.565 --> 00:54:29.766
there's a very very strong impetus

1461
00:54:29.766 --> 00:54:31.864
to simplify your life.

1462
00:54:31.864 --> 00:54:32.925
At least for me.
<v Interviewer>Very true.</v>

1463
00:54:32.925 --> 00:54:35.765
<v ->Simplify, simplify, simplify,</v>

1464
00:54:35.765 --> 00:54:36.985
and that's why there's gonna be a whole

1465
00:54:36.985 --> 00:54:38.585
economic shift in this country.

1466
00:54:38.585 --> 00:54:40.905
Because as this country, and people get more spiritual,

1467
00:54:40.905 --> 00:54:43.245
they're gonna want less and less and less

1468
00:54:43.245 --> 00:54:45.325
and we're gonna demand a society,

1469
00:54:45.325 --> 00:54:46.866
we're gonna create a culture I believe

1470
00:54:46.866 --> 00:54:48.925
where we're liberated from

1471
00:54:48.925 --> 00:54:51.142
that consumer mentality.

1472
00:54:51.142 --> 00:54:53.322
You know have to consume, it's our right

1473
00:54:53.322 --> 00:54:55.282
to consume, you know we have to consume

1474
00:54:55.282 --> 00:54:56.600
to keep the American economy going.

1475
00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:57.921
You know, you look at Christmas.

1476
00:54:57.921 --> 00:54:59.901
<v Interviewer>What's that transition look like?</v>

1477
00:54:59.901 --> 00:55:02.499
What's that transition look like from

1478
00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:06.740
20 fliers in the Sunday paper for the next sale,

1479
00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:09.316
to the life you're talking about?

1480
00:55:09.316 --> 00:55:11.195
What does that economically look like?

1481
00:55:11.195 --> 00:55:13.034
<v ->I believe the bottom line is</v>

1482
00:55:13.034 --> 00:55:15.615
creating that clean energy system.

1483
00:55:15.615 --> 00:55:18.314
Because people need to consume

1484
00:55:18.314 --> 00:55:19.232
because this is what our jobs,

1485
00:55:19.232 --> 00:55:21.172
you know you're a salesperson or this,

1486
00:55:21.172 --> 00:55:24.062
you're selling, I mean everybody's marketing something.

1487
00:55:24.062 --> 00:55:26.879
So we're in this transitional phase where

1488
00:55:26.879 --> 00:55:28.579
we have to create a system that's based on

1489
00:55:28.579 --> 00:55:31.419
unlimited energy, so that we're not

1490
00:55:31.419 --> 00:55:32.899
having to go out so hard to work

1491
00:55:32.899 --> 00:55:34.399
to make a living.

1492
00:55:34.399 --> 00:55:35.079
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

1493
00:55:35.079 --> 00:55:36.249
<v ->I mean this is...</v>

1494
00:55:37.219 --> 00:55:38.599
And one of the best ways of course is

1495
00:55:38.599 --> 00:55:41.439
insurance for yourself is to maximize your health,

1496
00:55:41.439 --> 00:55:43.379
'cause you've got more energy, you've got more

1497
00:55:43.379 --> 00:55:45.400
creativity, you're gonna be more effective

1498
00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.959
in whatever it is you do.

1499
00:55:46.959 --> 00:55:48.099
<v Interviewer>So what it comes down to,</v>

1500
00:55:48.099 --> 00:55:50.879
we are our greatest resource, period.

1501
00:55:50.879 --> 00:55:52.949
<v ->Absolutely, no doubt.</v>

1502
00:55:55.059 --> 00:55:57.539
<v ->DaVid's company Artainment offers some</v>

1503
00:55:57.539 --> 00:56:00.519

on natural healing from life challenging disease,

1509
00:56:12.239 --> 00:56:15.599
you will likely enjoy our interview with Dr. Lorraine Day,

1510
00:56:15.599 --> 00:56:18.319
who reversed her end stage cancer

1511
00:56:18.319 --> 00:56:20.779
by issuing the medical industry in favor of

1512
00:56:20.779 --> 00:56:23.639
the diet spoken of in the Old Testament.

1513
00:56:23.639 --> 00:56:26.199
Until next time, thanks for watching.

1514
