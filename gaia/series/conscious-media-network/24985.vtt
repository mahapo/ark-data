00:00:00.922 --> 00:00:04.058
<v ->Tom Bender is physicist and philosopher at heart,</v>

2
00:00:04.058 --> 00:00:05.700
and an architect by trade.

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.656
He uses all of these skills to create alchemical changes

4
00:00:08.656 --> 00:00:11.119
in the dwelling he modifies and creates.

5
00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.436
Tom shows us in this interview that the age of expansion

6
00:00:14.436 --> 00:00:16.942
is all but dead, and giving way to a simpler

7
00:00:16.942 --> 00:00:19.982
and more contemplative use of space and resources,

8
00:00:19.982 --> 00:00:23.043
including our own internal spiritual resources.

9
00:00:23.043 --> 00:00:25.859
One of the tenants of using space in a sacred manner

10
00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.856
is understanding that there's a life force called "chi"

11
00:00:28.856 --> 00:00:32.067
that permeates all of life, a force that the western world

12
00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:35.634
gives little, if any, consideration to.

13
00:00:37.656 --> 00:00:41.084 line:15% 
(ethereal music)

14
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.324
In the very first part of your book,

15
00:00:45.324 --> 00:00:48.396
you talk about chi and the life force energy.

16
00:00:48.396 --> 00:00:50.508
One thing I thought was kind of interesting

17
00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:52.663
is I decided to go ahead and count,

18
00:00:52.663 --> 00:00:54.008
in all the different languages,

19
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:56.726
the number of different ways in which that word

20
00:00:56.726 --> 00:00:59.372
is used and said, the different words for

21
00:00:59.372 --> 00:01:01.910
"life force energy," and as I recall, it was somewhere

22
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.462
between 85 and 90 words around the world

23
00:01:05.462 --> 00:01:08.385
for "chi" or "life force energy," and yet,

24
00:01:08.385 --> 00:01:10.635
most people in the western world

25
00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:13.216
really know very little of this.

26
00:01:13.216 --> 00:01:14.578
Why?

27
00:01:14.578 --> 00:01:16.622
<v ->I think that probably goes back to</v>

28
00:01:17.896 --> 00:01:20.935
about 300 A.D. when the Christian church

29
00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:23.797
banished direct experience of the sacred.

30
00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.709
It came back during the gothic period,

31
00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:32.581
but then there was a few martyrs at that point,

32
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:34.533
and it got surpressed again,

33
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.296
but it has been outside of our culture, I think,

34
00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:42.296
because we focused on the rational part of ourselves

35
00:01:43.887 --> 00:01:47.972
because its power was suddenly revealing itself.

36
00:01:47.972 --> 00:01:50.202
I don't think that's bad.

37
00:01:50.202 --> 00:01:52.665
What I have learned of chi energy

38
00:01:52.665 --> 00:01:55.108
is it's a totally different consciousness.

39
00:01:55.108 --> 00:01:57.678
It's a totally different media,

40
00:01:57.678 --> 00:01:59.630
it's outside of space and time,

41
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.992
it's a magnetic defraction energy

42
00:02:03.992 --> 00:02:06.787
which is sort of superimposed or inside

43
00:02:06.787 --> 00:02:08.568
of the material world,

44
00:02:08.568 --> 00:02:13.261
but it is the realm where quantum non-locality

45
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:15.929
takes place, where everything is connected,

46
00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:19.565
where you flip a photon here, ten lightyears away,

47
00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:24.020
its partner flips instantly.

48
00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.841
That means that everything is connected,

49
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:28.420
everything is consciousness,

50
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.109
and everything is aware of everything going on,

51
00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.828
and I call that our mainframe consciousness,

52
00:02:33.828 --> 00:02:37.682
using computer analogy, and that it's integral

53
00:02:37.682 --> 00:02:41.026
consciousness that everything is a part of.

54
00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:42.930
Someplace along the line,

55
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.812
we grew this computer peripheral

56
00:02:46.812 --> 00:02:49.991
on top of our neck that has all these

57
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:55.239
cameras and these audio receivers and things.

58
00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.606
<v ->Stuck simply in the five senses.</v>

59
00:02:57.606 --> 00:03:00.230
<v ->The five senses, and they are wonderful</v>

60
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.068
because they are so powerful in helping us

61
00:03:03.068 --> 00:03:06.331
deal with living in the material dimension

62
00:03:06.331 --> 00:03:09.904
of our reality, but the problem is

63
00:03:09.904 --> 00:03:13.275
that they drown out the chi energy,

64
00:03:13.275 --> 00:03:15.269
the integral consciousness.

65
00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.248
We have to learn, as every culture has,

66
00:03:19.248 --> 00:03:21.541
how to set aside that rational world,

67
00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:24.261
and be able to connect back in with the other.

68
00:03:24.261 --> 00:03:27.301
The rational is so powerful, it's like an engine,

69
00:03:27.301 --> 00:03:31.066
this V8 800 horsepower engine,

70
00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:33.551
but without a steering wheel, without brakes,

71
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:35.940
without a map, it's creating all over hell,

72
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.444
destroying everything.

73
00:03:37.444 --> 00:03:39.471
<v ->Boy, is that the truth (laughs).</v>

74
00:03:39.471 --> 00:03:42.489
We're sitting here in your home and your office

75
00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.689
certainly exemplify having created the sacred space,

76
00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:47.129
which we're going to be talking about,

77
00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.051
and the flow of the chi, the energy, through here.

78
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:53.443
It's a blustery rainy day on the coast of Oregon,

79
00:03:53.443 --> 00:03:54.861
just a beautiful setting.

80
00:03:54.861 --> 00:03:55.725
<v ->A usual summer day.</v>

81
00:03:55.725 --> 00:03:58.883
<v ->Usual summer day, but you can feel the energy</v>

82
00:03:58.883 --> 00:04:01.250
pouring in and permeating everything.

83
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.034
This isn't where you necessarily started

84
00:04:04.034 --> 00:04:06.562
in your own internal mental landscape.

85
00:04:06.562 --> 00:04:09.751
You say yourself you were quite left-brained at one time.

86
00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:13.836
<v ->Yeah, I grew up in the 40s and 50s in the Midwest</v>

87
00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:16.001
and there was nothing else except that

88
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:18.231
rational landscape and I, of course,

89
00:04:18.231 --> 00:04:23.231
bought into it and became the total left brain-

90
00:04:23.873 --> 00:04:25.089
We didn't have any geeks at that time,

91
00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:27.664
but I would have been a geek at that point.

92
00:04:28.108 --> 00:04:32.747
I started out in physics and ended up in architecture,

93
00:04:32.747 --> 00:04:36.651
and eventually, over time, I learned to let go of

94
00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:38.581
some of that stuff, thank goodness.

95
00:04:38.581 --> 00:04:41.131
<v ->Now, how old were you, because one of your mentors</v>

96
00:04:41.131 --> 00:04:43.904
was Butnam Sephor and certainly is some

97
00:04:43.904 --> 00:04:45.247
very forward thinking.

98
00:04:45.247 --> 00:04:47.753
At what point in your life did you start letting go

99
00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:51.518
of those severely rationalist point of view?

100
00:04:51.518 --> 00:04:53.396
<v ->Oh, mid 70s.</v>

101
00:04:53.396 --> 00:04:54.450
<v ->Okay.</v>

102
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.978
So you were well into your adulthood.

103
00:04:56.978 --> 00:05:00.051
Tell us a little bit about how your journey into the

104
00:05:00.051 --> 00:05:04.058
more sacred and into the more quantum world began.

105
00:05:05.781 --> 00:05:09.472
<v ->One big step was when we built our house here,</v>

106
00:05:09.472 --> 00:05:14.472
and we built it to last for 200 years, not for 20 years,

107
00:05:15.583 --> 00:05:17.066
and built it totally by hand.

108
00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:20.895
We had no electricity here and we sharpened the saws

109
00:05:20.895 --> 00:05:23.103
and cut the plywood and built it,

110
00:05:23.103 --> 00:05:27.007
and finished it, oiled the floors, went back to Portland

111
00:05:27.007 --> 00:05:28.745
to get the rest of our stuff, and the next morning,

112
00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:33.459
it had burned down, which is a bit of a shock in itself.

113
00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:35.113
<v ->Wow, no kidding.</v>

114
00:05:35.113 --> 00:05:38.110
<v ->Then, a few weeks later, we were talking in Portland</v>

115
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.008
with a friend who had moved from the east coast

116
00:05:40.008 --> 00:05:41.939
and his wife was with him, and she got a very strange

117
00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:43.987
look on her face.

118
00:05:45.107 --> 00:05:47.517
She said, "Well, I've got to tell you.

119
00:05:47.517 --> 00:05:50.770
"I had a dream a month before that your house

120
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.021
"was going to burn on that date

121
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:55.500
"and I wrote it down in my journal."

122
00:05:56.157 --> 00:05:58.503
She'd never had precognitive dreams before,

123
00:05:58.503 --> 00:06:00.615
and didn't know us really.

124
00:06:00.615 --> 00:06:02.887
Who would you pick up a phone to a stranger

125
00:06:02.887 --> 00:06:04.488
and say, "I just dreamed your house is gonna burn down?"

126
00:06:04.488 --> 00:06:07.324
<v ->Right, not a phone call you'd would want to make.</v>

127
00:06:07.324 --> 00:06:09.321
<v ->She didn't even know that we were building this house.</v>

128
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:12.011
She assumed it was our house in Portland,

129
00:06:12.347 --> 00:06:16.176
but that was a real wake up call saying,

130
00:06:16.176 --> 00:06:18.448
"Okay, there's more to this world

131
00:06:18.448 --> 00:06:21.818
"than what we pick up through our computer peripherals."

132
00:06:21.818 --> 00:06:25.092
There's more going on and please don't tell me again.

133
00:06:25.092 --> 00:06:26.654
I got the message.

134
00:06:26.654 --> 00:06:27.817
(laughter)

135
00:06:27.817 --> 00:06:29.374
<v ->Well, that was a harsh message.</v>

136
00:06:29.374 --> 00:06:31.208
Did you ever figure out why the house burned down,

137
00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:33.694
or did you simply leave a candle lit?

138
00:06:33.694 --> 00:06:37.384
<v ->It was oily rags from oiling the floor,</v>

139
00:06:37.384 --> 00:06:40.104
and it was the second time we'd oiled the floor.

140
00:06:40.104 --> 00:06:42.216
No problems the first time.

141
00:06:42.216 --> 00:06:44.765
It was 32 degrees when we left.

142
00:06:44.765 --> 00:06:47.346
We put the rags on a rock in the entryway,

143
00:06:47.346 --> 00:06:50.172
and my assumption was spontaneous combustion

144
00:06:50.172 --> 00:06:52.338
is something that happens in a closet under the stairs

145
00:06:52.338 --> 00:06:53.820
after a couple months.

146
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.281
Half the fire people said, "Yeah."

147
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:57.820
The others said, "No, that's of course what it was."

148
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.948
When we rebuilt, I put the rags in a fire pit outside

149
00:07:01.948 --> 00:07:04.529
and three hours, they burst into flame.

150
00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:05.318
<v ->Oh, interesting.</v>

151
00:07:05.318 --> 00:07:10.318
<v ->I think what happened was a part of the oil on the floor</v>

152
00:07:11.003 --> 00:07:12.700
had gotten sticky, and I probably had added

153
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.700
some turpentine to the rag to get the excess off of it,

154
00:07:17.829 --> 00:07:20.293
and that that lowered the flash point and made it go fast.

155
00:07:20.293 --> 00:07:22.192
That's just what set it off.

156
00:07:23.162 --> 00:07:25.633
A month ahead of time, remember that, Bender.

157
00:07:25.633 --> 00:07:26.262
<v ->Exactly.</v>

158
00:07:26.262 --> 00:07:27.649
I was going to say the month ahead of time

159
00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:28.811
is the interesting part.

160
00:07:28.811 --> 00:07:29.483
<v ->Yeah.</v>

161
00:07:29.483 --> 00:07:30.786
<v ->Okay, you had the oily rags.</v>

162
00:07:30.786 --> 00:07:32.640
Have you ever had a chance to look at it since then

163
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.918
and try to put together why that had to happen in that way?

164
00:07:36.918 --> 00:07:38.912
<v ->Because I needed to wake up.</v>

165
00:07:38.912 --> 00:07:40.768
I needed to be aware that there was more

166
00:07:40.768 --> 00:07:42.560
than just the rational world,

167
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.901
and to at least get out of the,

168
00:07:46.901 --> 00:07:49.205
"I know this is true, I know this is bullshit,"

169
00:07:49.205 --> 00:07:52.127
put that third bin there.

170
00:07:52.127 --> 00:07:54.047
"I have no clue," or "I don't know enough."

171
00:07:55.327 --> 00:07:56.192
Maybe.

172
00:07:56.192 --> 00:07:57.076
<v ->It's a humble bin.</v>

173
00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:58.434
<v ->Yeah, it's a humble bin.</v>

174
00:07:58.434 --> 00:07:59.683
(laughter)

175
00:07:59.683 --> 00:08:03.426
<v ->So you've done some spectacular projects</v>

176
00:08:03.426 --> 00:08:05.955
through your life in terms of sustainable architecture.

177
00:08:05.955 --> 00:08:08.674
You've demonstrated that in your own home,

178
00:08:08.674 --> 00:08:10.924
but you have some real underlying tenants.

179
00:08:10.924 --> 00:08:12.685
You're a philosopher at heart.

180
00:08:12.685 --> 00:08:14.103
Sounds like you're more a philosopher

181
00:08:14.103 --> 00:08:16.865
and a physicist, even, than an architect,

182
00:08:16.865 --> 00:08:19.190
and these principles are really underlying

183
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.091
all of your work in sustainable living and community.

184
00:08:22.091 --> 00:08:26.181
Let's start with your perception of what is

185
00:08:26.181 --> 00:08:29.061
awry right now, what we've done to ourselves

186
00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:31.012
in terms of the chi of our communities,

187
00:08:31.012 --> 00:08:33.790
and our families, and our relationships.

188
00:08:35.076 --> 00:08:36.889
<v ->I don't think there's anything awry.</v>

189
00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:37.604
<v ->Okay.</v>

190
00:08:37.604 --> 00:08:40.185
<v ->I think everything is as it needs to be.</v>

191
00:08:40.185 --> 00:08:42.532
That doesn't means it's comfortable,

192
00:08:42.532 --> 00:08:47.532
but I think that things have to get to the intensity

193
00:08:47.587 --> 00:08:50.648
of what we would now say, "offness,"

194
00:08:50.648 --> 00:08:55.648
to make us really clear what we need to change and how.

195
00:08:56.504 --> 00:09:00.568
We have been in a period of growth when growth is possible

196
00:09:00.568 --> 00:09:05.351
when we tapped into fossil fuels, and that just-

197
00:09:06.818 --> 00:09:11.479
A forest when there's a fire or something is log,

198
00:09:11.479 --> 00:09:14.636
a forest grows up, the first succession.

199
00:09:14.636 --> 00:09:16.567
Out here, it's the alder trees.

200
00:09:16.567 --> 00:09:21.185
They grow up quickly and capture all the sunlight,

201
00:09:21.185 --> 00:09:25.718
but then another forest grows up in between.

202
00:09:25.718 --> 00:09:30.683
The conifers grow up between and the alders rot away.

203
00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:34.540
You move from the growth to the sustainable,

204
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.245
in that case, ecosystem, in our case, culture.

205
00:09:38.603 --> 00:09:40.715
That's where we are, and that's why we feel

206
00:09:40.715 --> 00:09:45.715
that something is off because it's the past phase,

207
00:09:46.538 --> 00:09:50.165
which is right in itself ending, and a new phase beginning.

208
00:09:50.165 --> 00:09:51.861
We're in that transition.

209
00:09:51.861 --> 00:09:54.164
<v ->We're the alder trees that are starting to decay.</v>

210
00:09:54.164 --> 00:09:55.072
<v ->Nope, nope.</v>

211
00:09:55.072 --> 00:09:55.861
<v ->No?</v>

212
00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:57.834
<v ->We're both. We're the forest.</v>

213
00:09:57.834 --> 00:09:58.985
<v ->We're the forest.</v>

214
00:09:58.985 --> 00:10:01.428
We're the alder trees and we're the growing conifers.

215
00:10:01.428 --> 00:10:06.372
<v ->We're the sustainable, which is growing within</v>

216
00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:08.670
the growth culture.

217
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:12.499
<v ->Let's say for this is the culture that is beginning now</v>

218
00:10:12.499 --> 00:10:15.240
to need to transition into a new growth,

219
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.238
new type of culture, what are some of the factors

220
00:10:18.238 --> 00:10:21.949
you feel we need to begin releasing, and letting go of,

221
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:24.744
and allowing to give way to other factors?

222
00:10:24.744 --> 00:10:27.799
Where would you put your emphasis on it?

223
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.553
<v ->Let go of everything.</v>

224
00:10:31.553 --> 00:10:32.619
(laughter)

225
00:10:32.619 --> 00:10:34.827
<v ->Okay, because you do.</v>

226
00:10:34.827 --> 00:10:36.918
In your book, you talk a lot about letting go,

227
00:10:36.918 --> 00:10:39.445
letting go of concepts of what family

228
00:10:39.445 --> 00:10:41.440
and relationship to each other, and community is,

229
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.544
old ways of letting go of old ways of looking,

230
00:10:44.544 --> 00:10:46.538
even at what a house is,

231
00:10:46.538 --> 00:10:48.193
how a house and the rooms of the house

232
00:10:48.193 --> 00:10:50.165
should be viewed, which we'll get to in a little bit,

233
00:10:50.165 --> 00:10:52.202
which I find quite interesting.

234
00:10:53.632 --> 00:10:56.202
It seems that you are about letting go

235
00:10:56.202 --> 00:10:57.898
on a lot of levels.

236
00:10:58.838 --> 00:11:00.302
<v ->That's essential in the process,</v>

237
00:11:00.302 --> 00:11:05.302
and it's essential in the realms that we are discovering,

238
00:11:05.805 --> 00:11:08.151
all these additional realms, not just the physical,

239
00:11:08.151 --> 00:11:10.967
and they do not work on a causal basis,

240
00:11:10.967 --> 00:11:14.051
so we can't operate in the same way.

241
00:11:14.051 --> 00:11:15.959
We have to just be in the moment,

242
00:11:15.959 --> 00:11:20.294
be in the now with them and whatever happens.

243
00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:25.057
It's also that going from a growth to a sustainable world,

244
00:11:25.057 --> 00:11:27.915
everything operates on almost inverse,

245
00:11:27.915 --> 00:11:29.985
180 degree different principles.

246
00:11:29.985 --> 00:11:33.760
Everything that we assumed was absolutely the way to be,

247
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.152
and it was the way to be during that period,

248
00:11:37.152 --> 00:11:41.285
is now absolutely 180 degrees off.

249
00:11:42.453 --> 00:11:45.354
<v ->There are various degrees of urgency to that message, too,</v>

250
00:11:45.354 --> 00:11:49.599
environmentally, and in terms of our eco-sustainability.

251
00:11:49.599 --> 00:11:50.965
Can you address some of the issues that really are

252
00:11:50.965 --> 00:11:53.919
more paramount to be addressed in this transition,

253
00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:57.028
and then we can go into others from there?

254
00:11:57.375 --> 00:11:59.284
<v ->One is energy, obviously.</v>

255
00:11:59.284 --> 00:12:01.556
On one side, it's the global warming issues

256
00:12:01.556 --> 00:12:03.465
that are coming to the fore.

257
00:12:03.465 --> 00:12:06.206
The opposite side of that is the peak oil,

258
00:12:06.206 --> 00:12:08.084
which we're into also.

259
00:12:08.084 --> 00:12:11.155
They both are dealing with the fossil fuel energies,

260
00:12:11.155 --> 00:12:14.259
this huge storehouse of energy slaves

261
00:12:14.259 --> 00:12:16.520
that have supported our whole culture,

262
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:21.416
and that from using up all the easy stuff to get to,

263
00:12:21.416 --> 00:12:23.741
and getting less and less net energy

264
00:12:23.741 --> 00:12:26.429
our of more and more work to get what's left,

265
00:12:26.429 --> 00:12:27.592
and having to compete more,

266
00:12:27.592 --> 00:12:30.845
it being a seller's market instead of a buyer's market,

267
00:12:30.845 --> 00:12:32.765
all that shifts and it says

268
00:12:32.765 --> 00:12:37.765
the sooner we shift to not just more efficient processes,

269
00:12:38.802 --> 00:12:42.311
but really rethinking the whole thing from the goals

270
00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:45.703
that we want to achieve to how we get there

271
00:12:45.703 --> 00:12:47.883
is vital.

272
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.561
It's been very easy to throw more money

273
00:12:52.561 --> 00:12:54.950
and more energy at problems

274
00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.136
rather than going to the root and solving them.

275
00:12:57.136 --> 00:13:00.614
All of our systems have gotten incredibly inefficient.

276
00:13:00.614 --> 00:13:04.517
They don't appear that way, but they are.

277
00:13:04.517 --> 00:13:06.139
Take forestry for example.

278
00:13:07.229 --> 00:13:10.097
The commercial forest rotations have dropped

279
00:13:10.097 --> 00:13:11.717
to about 40 years.

280
00:13:11.717 --> 00:13:15.152
They cut everything when it gets 40 years of age,

281
00:13:15.152 --> 00:13:18.660
but if you go out and look at a hillside of stumps,

282
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.816
it's going to take 20 years before it even captures

283
00:13:20.816 --> 00:13:23.439
all the solar energy that's coming into it.

284
00:13:23.439 --> 00:13:28.439
So you're wasting half of the growth, and you're also,

285
00:13:29.081 --> 00:13:33.103
if you go from 40 to, say, 160 year rotations,

286
00:13:33.103 --> 00:13:38.094
you're getting way more material, more wood, better wood.

287
00:13:38.094 --> 00:13:43.094
You're only having to harvest

288
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.358
one-fourth of the times you would.

289
00:13:45.358 --> 00:13:47.382
You only have to replant one-fourth of the times,

290
00:13:47.382 --> 00:13:50.699
you only have to do thinning one-fourth of the times.

291
00:13:50.699 --> 00:13:54.837
All of the work that's involved gets decreased dramatically,

292
00:13:54.837 --> 00:13:57.835
and the economic benefits comes out to be

293
00:13:57.835 --> 00:14:00.245
something like 20 times as good.

294
00:14:00.245 --> 00:14:03.381
<v ->Yeah, but where's the instant gratification in that?</v>

295
00:14:03.381 --> 00:14:07.190
<v ->It has nothing to do with that</v>

296
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:09.770
from a real economic standpoint.

297
00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.831
I looked at that and said,

298
00:14:12.831 --> 00:14:15.412
"How can this be? How can we ignore that?"

299
00:14:15.412 --> 00:14:18.911
We ignore it because, literally in this case,

300
00:14:18.911 --> 00:14:20.660
we've cut down the alternatives.

301
00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.886
<v ->Yes.</v>

302
00:14:21.886 --> 00:14:26.601
<v ->For a system based on carpet structure</v>

303
00:14:26.601 --> 00:14:31.601
and bottom line in an immediate time period,

304
00:14:32.479 --> 00:14:34.355
sure, you cut everything as quick as you can

305
00:14:34.355 --> 00:14:37.192
and it really looks good while you're CEO,

306
00:14:37.192 --> 00:14:39.720
and the next guy ends up with all the empty hillsides.

307
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.809
<v ->Stumps.</v>

308
00:14:41.969 --> 00:14:46.600
<v ->If you're the next guy, if you're the stump CEO,</v>

309
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.498
what's your best option?

310
00:14:48.498 --> 00:14:50.642
It's to harvest as quick as you can,

311
00:14:50.642 --> 00:14:52.796
to start getting some money rolling in,

312
00:14:52.796 --> 00:14:57.796
but it is not the best in terms of the long term economics,

313
00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:00.849
and we're always in the long term of either

314
00:15:00.849 --> 00:15:04.689
the business or the culture of the economy.

315
00:15:04.689 --> 00:15:06.630
This is true every place across the board,

316
00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.497
education, everything.

317
00:15:11.016 --> 00:15:14.275
<v ->Do you feel that modern culture</v>

318
00:15:14.275 --> 00:15:16.420
of the last, say, 50 years,

319
00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:20.173
is different, historically, than any other period of time

320
00:15:20.173 --> 00:15:24.056
in terms of the focus, almost solely,

321
00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:26.562
on instant gratification, and immediate growth,

322
00:15:26.562 --> 00:15:28.674
and immediate returns?

323
00:15:28.674 --> 00:15:30.829
Was it that way in the past?

324
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:32.247
<v ->I don't know. I wasn't there.</v>

325
00:15:32.247 --> 00:15:34.967
<v ->Just looking at it historically,</v>

326
00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:36.844
it seems as though we really have had

327
00:15:36.844 --> 00:15:38.956
very little forethought in the last few decades

328
00:15:38.956 --> 00:15:41.516
as to what this planet can sustain,

329
00:15:41.516 --> 00:15:45.200
and not only that, what we as human beings can sustain.

330
00:15:45.345 --> 00:15:48.577
<v ->The basis of the growth system</v>

331
00:15:48.577 --> 00:15:53.195
is to maximize what comes into the tree,

332
00:15:53.195 --> 00:15:56.022
or the person, or the corporation, or whatever it is,

333
00:15:56.022 --> 00:15:59.115
and that means you cut out all the future stuff,

334
00:15:59.115 --> 00:16:01.717
and it means that not only do you do that,

335
00:16:01.717 --> 00:16:03.776
but you get into people's minds

336
00:16:03.776 --> 00:16:07.306
that that is the way, the way to be.

337
00:16:12.496 --> 00:16:16.203
It's not that we need to let go of either the rational

338
00:16:16.203 --> 00:16:20.169
or any of the pieces we've had, it's that we

339
00:16:20.169 --> 00:16:22.975
put together the intuity of consciouness,

340
00:16:22.975 --> 00:16:25.140
and the rational consciousness.

341
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.718
As much as this culture has been,

342
00:16:30.718 --> 00:16:33.642
is totally different from anything before.

343
00:16:33.642 --> 00:16:35.668
What we're going into is totally different

344
00:16:35.668 --> 00:16:38.942
from anything before because we have the potential

345
00:16:38.942 --> 00:16:43.389
of that power, ability of things.

346
00:16:43.389 --> 00:16:45.992
Second world war was amazing,

347
00:16:45.992 --> 00:16:49.426
what we accomplished just in industrial output

348
00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:52.306
to support wars all the way around the world.

349
00:16:52.306 --> 00:16:55.421
Going to the moon was amazing.

350
00:16:55.421 --> 00:16:57.447
To marshall the skills and abilities

351
00:16:57.447 --> 00:17:01.740
to do something that had never been dreamed of before.

352
00:17:02.247 --> 00:17:05.297
Putting that together with really getting clear

353
00:17:05.297 --> 00:17:08.988
on what our goals that nourish us as individuals,

354
00:17:08.988 --> 00:17:13.988
as a culture, as a planet, and putting together the goals,

355
00:17:14.321 --> 00:17:18.343
the intuition, and the rational, wow.

356
00:17:18.343 --> 00:17:21.275
<v ->I agree with you, I think it's exciting times ahead.</v>

357
00:17:21.275 --> 00:17:22.421
<v ->We've got some wonderful stuff coming ahead.</v>

358
00:17:22.421 --> 00:17:23.743
<v ->I think so too.</v>

359
00:17:23.743 --> 00:17:27.135
Let's go back to another more ancient model.

360
00:17:27.135 --> 00:17:29.173
Let's go back to the Egyptians, for example,

361
00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:30.708
and their understanding of chi,

362
00:17:30.708 --> 00:17:34.814
their understanding of life force and sacred space.

363
00:17:34.814 --> 00:17:37.236
Some of the work that you've done, as I understand it,

364
00:17:37.236 --> 00:17:40.062
has been, if not directly based on,

365
00:17:40.062 --> 00:17:41.694
certainly based on the concepts

366
00:17:41.694 --> 00:17:44.435
of some of what the Egyptians knew in their time.

367
00:17:44.435 --> 00:17:45.982
Can you talk a little bit about

368
00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:49.000
some of the ancient understandings of chi?

369
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.509
<v ->I can try.</v>

370
00:17:51.048 --> 00:17:54.461
I spent a short part of my life teaching architectural

371
00:17:54.461 --> 00:17:57.437
history so I put on my historian hat.

372
00:17:57.437 --> 00:17:58.781
<v ->Okay, let's hear it.</v>

373
00:18:00.461 --> 00:18:03.378
<v ->As I was learning about chi energy and place</v>

374
00:18:03.378 --> 00:18:05.746
because I came into it through architecture,

375
00:18:05.746 --> 00:18:08.626
through practicing architecture more than

376
00:18:08.626 --> 00:18:11.996
as a historian or anything.

377
00:18:11.996 --> 00:18:14.385
I started looking back at these other cultures

378
00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:18.641
and discovering that they were using it,

379
00:18:18.641 --> 00:18:20.774
and finding in one culture and then another,

380
00:18:20.774 --> 00:18:25.774
knowing that suddenly, 65 or 80 cultures did it,

381
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.177
what did they do, how did they use it?

382
00:18:28.177 --> 00:18:32.074
The Egyptians were a wonderful

383
00:18:34.011 --> 00:18:37.349
ground of expertise and skill.

384
00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:41.786
If you go into the Temple of Hathor

385
00:18:41.786 --> 00:18:46.520
at Dendera, for example, it's a later Egyptian temple,

386
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:50.685
any images you see of the temple or photographs

387
00:18:50.685 --> 00:18:52.893
or anything, they're of the building,

388
00:18:52.893 --> 00:18:56.306
but the building, when you go to the temple,

389
00:18:56.306 --> 00:19:01.306
the building is inside a precinct, a sacred precinct

390
00:19:01.437 --> 00:19:04.705
that's about 900 feet square,

391
00:19:05.223 --> 00:19:07.223
which is nothing in itself.

392
00:19:07.223 --> 00:19:10.273
It's enclosed by a wall, which is nothing in itself,

393
00:19:10.273 --> 00:19:13.826
but this wall is 30 to 50 feet thick,

394
00:19:13.826 --> 00:19:15.745
and 50 to 80 feet high.

395
00:19:15.745 --> 00:19:17.147
<v ->Thick?</v>

396
00:19:17.147 --> 00:19:18.171
Amazing.

397
00:19:18.171 --> 00:19:21.414
<v ->It has something like five million cubic feet</v>

398
00:19:21.414 --> 00:19:25.360
of mud bricks, every one made by hand.

399
00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.568
<v Interviewer>50 feet thick.</v>
<v Tom>50 feet thick.</v>

400
00:19:27.568 --> 00:19:29.200
<v ->I didn't realize those walls were that thick.</v>

401
00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.330
<v ->Why?</v>

402
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.882
<v ->Why?</v>

403
00:19:32.048 --> 00:19:37.048
<v ->Well, the Egyptian creation story</v>

404
00:19:37.967 --> 00:19:40.987
isn't this fancy thing of we came from the Pleiades

405
00:19:40.987 --> 00:19:44.962
or whatever, they say, "We came from the mud."

406
00:19:46.493 --> 00:19:49.662
I heard that, I said, "That's not pre Dob."

407
00:19:49.662 --> 00:19:51.542
(laughter)

408
00:19:51.542 --> 00:19:55.659
But being there and seeing that

409
00:19:55.659 --> 00:19:58.158
the annual floods of the Nile

410
00:19:58.158 --> 00:19:59.869
brought mud

411
00:19:59.869 --> 00:20:04.869
which was the fertility, which was life,

412
00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.899
which was their culture.

413
00:20:06.899 --> 00:20:11.452
Mud was their source of life.

414
00:20:11.452 --> 00:20:13.980
If you go to the first cataract of the Nile

415
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.862
they have excavated mud brick temple upon mud brick temple,

416
00:20:17.862 --> 00:20:21.905
30 or so mud brick temples built on top of each other.

417
00:20:21.905 --> 00:20:23.131
It's every hundred years or so,

418
00:20:23.131 --> 00:20:26.566
there's a major flood that washes away the temple.

419
00:20:26.566 --> 00:20:28.592
And I said to myself, of course,

420
00:20:28.592 --> 00:20:30.352
"Well why didn't they build them out of stone?"

421
00:20:30.352 --> 00:20:32.187
(laughter)

422
00:20:32.187 --> 00:20:35.322
And the answer is

423
00:20:35.322 --> 00:20:37.552
that the temple was an offering.

424
00:20:37.552 --> 00:20:39.845
It was a celebration of the mud,

425
00:20:39.845 --> 00:20:42.351
which was the source of life.

426
00:20:42.351 --> 00:20:46.415
So everything is totally different when you get into

427
00:20:46.415 --> 00:20:47.930
this kind of world.

428
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.668
You're talking about meaning, not aesthetics,

429
00:20:49.668 --> 00:20:51.737
when you get into architecture.

430
00:20:51.737 --> 00:20:54.201
The Temple of Hathor, going back to that-

431
00:20:54.201 --> 00:20:57.732
So every year after the floods they had to clean

432
00:20:57.732 --> 00:21:01.859
the new silt, the new mud that came into the precincts.

433
00:21:01.859 --> 00:21:05.667
So everybody made bricks and added to the wall

434
00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:08.984
but the intention in this and the energy

435
00:21:08.984 --> 00:21:12.313
of people putting it into this as the wall became

436
00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:16.770
20 feet thick, 30 feet thick, 40 feet thick, 50 feet thick,

437
00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:19.437
added power to this place, said,

438
00:21:19.437 --> 00:21:22.615
"This place is important to us, we value it."

439
00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:26.679
And the energy keeps building and building in a place.

440
00:21:26.679 --> 00:21:29.346
Anytime that we conceive of anything,

441
00:21:29.346 --> 00:21:31.490
you know some crazy idea,

442
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:34.508
it exists on the energy realm, the chi energy realm,

443
00:21:34.508 --> 00:21:36.940
the same as the material realm

444
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.681
and that exists forever just like we exist forever

445
00:21:39.681 --> 00:21:41.495
in the energy realms.

446
00:21:41.495 --> 00:21:46.495
And over a period of time if there is a deity, let's say,

447
00:21:47.179 --> 00:21:51.595
in Egypt and that is honored for a hundred years,

448
00:21:51.595 --> 00:21:53.611
a thousand years, five thousand years,

449
00:21:53.611 --> 00:21:57.675
all those prayers, all that celebration, all that gratitude

450
00:21:57.675 --> 00:21:59.701
goes into that energy ball and that energy ball

451
00:21:59.701 --> 00:22:03.221
gets stronger and stronger and stronger.

452
00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:05.738
And how the Egyptians dealt with this architecturally is

453
00:22:05.738 --> 00:22:06.826
fascinating.

454
00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:08.522
Again, every culture's different.

455
00:22:08.522 --> 00:22:12.842
But the typical temple, there will be a small sanctuary

456
00:22:12.842 --> 00:22:13.930
in the middle.

457
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.319
You go into the temple and you start a big

458
00:22:16.319 --> 00:22:19.060
hall of columns and then it gets smaller and darker

459
00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.641
and smaller and darker as you get into the inner sanctum,

460
00:22:21.641 --> 00:22:23.497
getting out of the bright sunlight,

461
00:22:23.497 --> 00:22:25.907
letting all that exterior world,

462
00:22:25.907 --> 00:22:28.745
all our computer peripherals shut down quietly

463
00:22:28.745 --> 00:22:30.558
and focus inward.

464
00:22:30.558 --> 00:22:32.392
You get into the center

465
00:22:32.392 --> 00:22:37.392
and there is a granite sanctuary.

466
00:22:37.704 --> 00:22:41.650
Granite being crystalline and focusing the life force energy

467
00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:46.205
and it's a absolutely plain, very simple place

468
00:22:46.205 --> 00:22:49.010
but it is where the energy is held.

469
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:51.869
Then around that is a whole series of chapels

470
00:22:51.869 --> 00:22:55.932
of dealing with that deity in relation to

471
00:22:55.932 --> 00:22:59.132
another of the deities in the pantheon.

472
00:22:59.132 --> 00:23:02.599
So that in this case

473
00:23:02.599 --> 00:23:04.614
they're linking the energy from this deity,

474
00:23:04.614 --> 00:23:06.705
that energy ball, to the energy balls

475
00:23:06.705 --> 00:23:09.030
of all the other deities and bringing it together

476
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:14.030
in this chapel or in the inner sanctum of the temple.

477
00:23:14.576 --> 00:23:18.080
The temples also, if you go to the...

478
00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.419
Can't remember, one of the other temples,

479
00:23:23.419 --> 00:23:26.234
Temple of Horus at Edfu,

480
00:23:26.234 --> 00:23:29.413
the precinct wall, which in that case is stone

481
00:23:29.413 --> 00:23:31.802
surrounding the temple, and the inside of it

482
00:23:31.802 --> 00:23:36.004
they've got all the paternity of the temple.

483
00:23:36.004 --> 00:23:39.002
This temple descended from this temple which

484
00:23:39.002 --> 00:23:40.979
was torn down a thousand years ago,

485
00:23:40.979 --> 00:23:43.997
which is descendent of that one and back, back, back

486
00:23:43.997 --> 00:23:45.416
in through time.

487
00:23:45.416 --> 00:23:47.507
And this isn't just proving royal blood.

488
00:23:47.507 --> 00:23:50.312
It is linking, again, to the energy of each of those

489
00:23:50.312 --> 00:23:53.127
energy balls through time, through that deity,

490
00:23:53.127 --> 00:23:55.165
in that place.

491
00:23:55.165 --> 00:23:59.186
And then the Egyptians would have the

492
00:23:59.186 --> 00:24:01.159
ceremonial calendar of the year

493
00:24:01.159 --> 00:24:05.202
going up and down the Nile from one temple to another.

494
00:24:05.202 --> 00:24:07.377
And this linking together the energy, again,

495
00:24:07.377 --> 00:24:09.510
from place to place.

496
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.933
And then in the Temple of Hathor, again,

497
00:24:11.933 --> 00:24:15.153
through the huge thick outer walls

498
00:24:15.153 --> 00:24:18.011
there are hidden crypts inside the walls

499
00:24:18.011 --> 00:24:21.190
that held special imagery

500
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:25.584
and was used for special initiatory ceremony and things.

501
00:24:25.584 --> 00:24:28.443
So there's layer after layer after layer of techniques

502
00:24:28.443 --> 00:24:30.810
of working with the energy.

503
00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:35.810
The statues are turned into living statues,

504
00:24:37.499 --> 00:24:39.397
as they're called in many cultures.

505
00:24:39.397 --> 00:24:41.466
There's the famous one of

506
00:24:43.836 --> 00:24:46.178
(mumbles) I can't remember.

507
00:24:46.536 --> 00:24:49.736
Words, names don't stay in here very much any more.

508
00:24:49.736 --> 00:24:51.625
There's a famous

509
00:24:51.625 --> 00:24:56.126
statue of a Pharoah sitting very stiffly

510
00:24:56.126 --> 00:25:00.999
as is normal on some Egyptian sculpture

511
00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:04.647
with Horus sitting around his head.

512
00:25:04.647 --> 00:25:06.268
What a weird thing.

513
00:25:06.268 --> 00:25:08.732
But what we know now is

514
00:25:08.732 --> 00:25:13.009
that's a trans-channeling posture that many people,

515
00:25:13.009 --> 00:25:17.115
when they are channeling, go into this body stiffness

516
00:25:17.115 --> 00:25:20.251
and open and the image is of Horus

517
00:25:20.251 --> 00:25:23.292
speaking through the Pharoah.

518
00:25:23.292 --> 00:25:25.360
<v ->Which one is this?</v>

519
00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.960
Do you remember the name yet?

520
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.029
<v ->It's in my book, I can't remember.</v>

521
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:30.928
<v ->I'll find it.</v>

522
00:25:30.928 --> 00:25:32.895
Yeah, I want to see that one.

523
00:25:33.114 --> 00:25:36.251
<v ->And I was at a sculpture exhibit</v>

524
00:25:36.251 --> 00:25:39.750
of Egyptian sculpture in Portland a month or so ago

525
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:44.750
and there was a statue of a scribe.

526
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.599
It was a son of a Pharoah or something

527
00:25:47.599 --> 00:25:49.925
but there was this old wrinkly guy sitting there sort of

528
00:25:49.925 --> 00:25:53.573
stooped over, you know, writing away or something.

529
00:25:53.573 --> 00:25:58.073
I'd seen it in the Egyptian museum in Cairo years ago.

530
00:25:58.073 --> 00:26:02.201
But this time I could really see it, it was lit.

531
00:26:02.201 --> 00:26:07.201
And I saw that the details, again, are where you see.

532
00:26:07.758 --> 00:26:10.957
He wasn't looking at this, he was staring,

533
00:26:10.957 --> 00:26:13.517
he was entranced, he was channeling.

534
00:26:13.517 --> 00:26:15.810
What he was scribing was what he was channeling.

535
00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:19.854
The irises of his eyes were huge.

536
00:26:19.854 --> 00:26:22.658
You don't see that in a photograph taken from

537
00:26:22.658 --> 00:26:24.376
far away.

538
00:26:24.376 --> 00:26:25.538
<v ->No, it makes perfect sense.</v>

539
00:26:25.538 --> 00:26:28.002
<v ->When you see, you get around to the side and you see</v>

540
00:26:28.002 --> 00:26:30.348
where he's looking, how he's looking

541
00:26:30.348 --> 00:26:32.460
compared to the writing.

542
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.476
Oh, it wasn't just that he was literate

543
00:26:34.476 --> 00:26:37.612
and was able to read and write and was honoring, no.

544
00:26:37.612 --> 00:26:40.726
He was channeling the spirits and connecting to them.

545
00:26:40.726 --> 00:26:41.398
<v ->Right.</v>

546
00:26:41.398 --> 00:26:44.162
<v ->Another whole piece of this is the healing temples.</v>

547
00:26:44.162 --> 00:26:46.859
There were sub-temples in the precinct, again, of

548
00:26:46.859 --> 00:26:49.920
Hathor at Dendera in which they would have

549
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.120
little chambers all around and they had a sacred well,

550
00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.211
a sacred spring there.

551
00:26:55.211 --> 00:26:59.414
And they had healing statues

552
00:26:59.414 --> 00:27:02.689
that were inscribed with hieroglyphics and would often

553
00:27:02.689 --> 00:27:06.293
be sitting sort of like a pan of stone.

554
00:27:06.293 --> 00:27:09.311
And people would take the water from the well

555
00:27:09.311 --> 00:27:11.791
and pour it over the statue

556
00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:16.064
and it turned into what we would now call homeopathics.

557
00:27:16.064 --> 00:27:17.417
<v ->Oh, I see, the actual fluid.</v>

558
00:27:17.417 --> 00:27:19.690
<v ->The statue was energized, it energized the water</v>

559
00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:22.548
as it flowed over it and then the person would drink it,

560
00:27:22.548 --> 00:27:24.681
bathe in it, whatever.

561
00:27:24.681 --> 00:27:26.910
<v ->Again, this had to do with a, maybe,</v>

562
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.770
many, many years of intention that had gone into the statue

563
00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:32.552
as well as the geometry or imagery itself

564
00:27:32.552 --> 00:27:35.421
and maybe the deity attached with it?

565
00:27:35.421 --> 00:27:38.804
<v ->That and just the fact that</v>

566
00:27:38.804 --> 00:27:41.202
it didn't have to have a lot of years of intention

567
00:27:41.202 --> 00:27:43.212
in the making.

568
00:27:43.378 --> 00:27:45.725
There is a ceremony of the opening of the eyes

569
00:27:45.725 --> 00:27:49.927
of statues that is common in many cultures

570
00:27:49.927 --> 00:27:53.715
where they go through a

571
00:27:53.715 --> 00:27:57.564
ritual process of opening to the spirit world and asking

572
00:27:57.564 --> 00:28:00.477
the spirit, the deity, whatever, to come

573
00:28:00.477 --> 00:28:04.146
and live in this place and be in connection.

574
00:28:04.146 --> 00:28:04.999
<v ->I see.</v>

575
00:28:04.999 --> 00:28:06.556
<v ->So it can be brought into any place</v>

576
00:28:06.556 --> 00:28:09.276
the same that we can bring good energy into

577
00:28:09.276 --> 00:28:11.345
any home, any place.

578
00:28:11.345 --> 00:28:15.782
We don't have to go through all of the fancy

579
00:28:15.782 --> 00:28:18.885
rituals that were developed from one culture to another.

580
00:28:18.885 --> 00:28:22.001
Everyone used what they stumbled on

581
00:28:22.001 --> 00:28:23.813
and every culture stumbled on different things

582
00:28:23.813 --> 00:28:26.106
but once you're familiar with them you see

583
00:28:26.106 --> 00:28:28.357
that they all come out of the same roots and

584
00:28:28.357 --> 00:28:29.915
there are alternatives.

585
00:28:29.915 --> 00:28:32.677
We don't have to follow the rules.

586
00:28:32.677 --> 00:28:33.638
(laughter)

587
00:28:33.638 --> 00:28:36.347
<v ->Yes, I like that about you in your thinking and your work.</v>

588
00:28:36.347 --> 00:28:38.672
Okay, so here you are with the Egyptian culture

589
00:28:38.672 --> 00:28:40.563
as one example of

590
00:28:41.023 --> 00:28:43.968
high intentionality in that everything was for purpose.

591
00:28:43.968 --> 00:28:47.339
Very few accidents left behind.

592
00:28:47.339 --> 00:28:52.339
And now we have a person moving into a new development

593
00:28:52.821 --> 00:28:56.191
with maybe 200 tracked houses that have just gone in

594
00:28:56.191 --> 00:28:58.422
and this is the world of growth,

595
00:28:58.422 --> 00:29:00.852
this is the progression we have made.

596
00:29:00.852 --> 00:29:05.852
How do we begin to re-introduce creativity

597
00:29:08.564 --> 00:29:12.180
and sacredness into something that can seem as

598
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.092
cookie-cutter and haphazard as going into

599
00:29:15.092 --> 00:29:17.918
a condominium or a cookie-cutter home somewhere

600
00:29:17.918 --> 00:29:20.030
in a track of hundreds?

601
00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:21.726
<v ->Well I've dealt with that all my life,</v>

602
00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:23.518
trying to do more than I was capable of.

603
00:29:23.518 --> 00:29:24.488
(laughter)

604
00:29:24.488 --> 00:29:27.112
Trying to do something I'd see in a temple

605
00:29:27.112 --> 00:29:29.757
in Japan or Egypt or whatever and say,

606
00:29:29.757 --> 00:29:32.180
"This would really work nicely."

607
00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.802
But it never worked because

608
00:29:34.802 --> 00:29:36.541
I don't think that you can do anything

609
00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:39.463
that is different from what you are.

610
00:29:39.463 --> 00:29:42.440
Anything we build is just a mirror reflecting us

611
00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.804
and our intentions

612
00:29:43.804 --> 00:29:48.804
and that the first answer is you don't do anything with that

613
00:29:49.009 --> 00:29:52.007
you do it with yourself.

614
00:29:52.007 --> 00:29:53.905
You ignore what's around if you want

615
00:29:53.905 --> 00:29:55.644
or to the degree that you can.

616
00:29:55.644 --> 00:29:57.969
Focus on yourself and getting clear

617
00:29:57.969 --> 00:30:02.427
and then whatever your intention is will just manifest.

618
00:30:02.427 --> 00:30:04.817
But then dealing with what is there,

619
00:30:04.817 --> 00:30:09.115
it's the way any architecture project is dealt with.

620
00:30:09.115 --> 00:30:11.760
You find out what you can't deal with or can't change

621
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.589
or what isn't worth changing, you know, what the limits are.

622
00:30:15.589 --> 00:30:17.104
Can you build a fence?

623
00:30:17.104 --> 00:30:19.291
Can you shut out some of this?

624
00:30:19.291 --> 00:30:20.933
No, but can you maybe build some plants

625
00:30:20.933 --> 00:30:23.579
and make grow like a fence?

626
00:30:23.579 --> 00:30:26.319
Can you plant things that will bring in birds

627
00:30:26.319 --> 00:30:28.292
and animals and things?

628
00:30:28.292 --> 00:30:30.874
Can you bring in native plants which tie with

629
00:30:30.874 --> 00:30:33.519
the wonderful spirit which is developed in each

630
00:30:33.519 --> 00:30:38.067
specific place over millennia with the climate and the,

631
00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:42.525
just all the patterns that are there together.

632
00:30:44.761 --> 00:30:49.656
One thing is to develop what I call sort of x-ray vision.

633
00:30:49.656 --> 00:30:51.608
You walk around inside your house

634
00:30:51.608 --> 00:30:54.041
and your x-ray vision goes through the wall

635
00:30:55.791 --> 00:30:58.232
and tries to remember what's outside it

636
00:30:58.232 --> 00:31:00.995
because a lot of people forget

637
00:31:00.995 --> 00:31:02.904
or they design houses to look like something,

638
00:31:02.904 --> 00:31:05.870
not to connect you with what's on the other side of it.

639
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:09.634
And you say, "Oh, this room has a window over here

640
00:31:09.634 --> 00:31:12.023
"but there's a beautiful tree over here.

641
00:31:12.023 --> 00:31:14.529
"We need to cut a hole in the wall."

642
00:31:14.529 --> 00:31:17.388
We did a project this last year

643
00:31:17.388 --> 00:31:19.266
showing how we could makeover,

644
00:31:19.266 --> 00:31:21.986
take the standard three bedroom ranch house

645
00:31:21.986 --> 00:31:23.521
and we turned it into flex housing.

646
00:31:23.521 --> 00:31:27.094
There's now I think eight people living and working there.

647
00:31:27.094 --> 00:31:31.531
But it was a house on top of a full concrete foundation

648
00:31:31.531 --> 00:31:32.918
which was half daylight.

649
00:31:32.918 --> 00:31:34.411
So there are these big concrete walls

650
00:31:34.411 --> 00:31:37.121
looking out on an incredible view of the estuary.

651
00:31:37.121 --> 00:31:39.542
And I discovered that they now have a,

652
00:31:39.542 --> 00:31:42.816
what's my favorite tool is a

653
00:31:42.816 --> 00:31:47.199
diamond bladed, water cooled, concrete cutting chainsaw.

654
00:31:47.199 --> 00:31:49.430
And you just take this, or have somebody,

655
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:52.885
take this chainsaw and go zoop, zoop, zoop, zoop

656
00:31:52.885 --> 00:31:55.306
and boom, this big slab of concrete falls down

657
00:31:55.306 --> 00:31:56.809
and you've got this big window looking out

658
00:31:56.809 --> 00:31:58.505
at incredible things.

659
00:31:58.505 --> 00:32:02.174
Find out where you can make connection with something

660
00:32:02.174 --> 00:32:05.054
that people have ignored or missed.

661
00:32:05.054 --> 00:32:07.818
Create something of the natural world outside

662
00:32:07.818 --> 00:32:10.718
to connect with or

663
00:32:10.718 --> 00:32:12.371
discover, just bring in the sunlight

664
00:32:12.371 --> 00:32:16.456
or make a shade trellis outside so if it's

665
00:32:16.456 --> 00:32:20.360
a hot sunny climate a wonderful place to be outside

666
00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:24.169
in connection with the rest of creation.

667
00:32:24.169 --> 00:32:25.463
Inside,

668
00:32:26.323 --> 00:32:28.573
again you start with yourself.

669
00:32:31.073 --> 00:32:34.972
The old realtor's trick is you put

670
00:32:34.972 --> 00:32:36.743
some apple cider and cinnamon on the stove.

671
00:32:36.743 --> 00:32:37.810
<v ->Or cookies in the oven.</v>

672
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:39.804
<v ->Or cookies in the oven, people come in,</v>

673
00:32:39.804 --> 00:32:41.896
"Oh, I like this."

674
00:32:41.896 --> 00:32:42.897
<v ->Right.</v>

675
00:32:42.897 --> 00:32:47.377
<v ->But it's the cookies and the cider, it isn't the house.</v>

676
00:32:47.377 --> 00:32:49.745
<v ->It's not the condo, it's the cookies.</v>

677
00:32:49.745 --> 00:32:51.558
<v ->But start with that.</v>

678
00:32:51.558 --> 00:32:54.950
The smell of fresh bread, flowers,

679
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:58.704
a song, music, the sound of birds,

680
00:32:58.704 --> 00:33:02.352
all these things transform the dreariest place

681
00:33:02.352 --> 00:33:04.319
just to begin with.

682
00:33:06.256 --> 00:33:11.256
Another thing is to start with is don't depend on stuff.

683
00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:13.242
It's usually, "Oh, I've got this room.

684
00:33:13.242 --> 00:33:14.287
"Oh, there's an empty spot over there,

685
00:33:14.287 --> 00:33:16.954
"I've got to put something there."

686
00:33:16.954 --> 00:33:18.906
Take everything out of a space

687
00:33:18.906 --> 00:33:20.879
and just have the empty space.

688
00:33:20.879 --> 00:33:22.928
Put a pillow down on the floor and sit there,

689
00:33:22.928 --> 00:33:25.199
lean up against the wall or whatever and just say,

690
00:33:25.199 --> 00:33:28.292
"Well, is this okay?

691
00:33:28.292 --> 00:33:30.404
"Or what do I really need?

692
00:33:30.404 --> 00:33:32.004
"What do I want to do in here?

693
00:33:32.004 --> 00:33:34.606
"And what's the minimum that will focus the energy

694
00:33:34.606 --> 00:33:37.134
"just on that?"

695
00:33:37.134 --> 00:33:40.590
We did a church project here a couple years ago

696
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:43.448
which started with a wonderful site with trees,

697
00:33:43.448 --> 00:33:45.400
a wonderful garden.

698
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.185
And when they were interviewing me I said,

699
00:33:48.185 --> 00:33:50.093
"Well my intention is to open the church,

700
00:33:50.093 --> 00:33:53.165
"the sanctuary and open it out into the garden."

701
00:33:53.165 --> 00:33:55.597
When I sat down to design it, and this was a case

702
00:33:55.597 --> 00:33:58.242
where I was consciously working in co-creation with

703
00:33:58.242 --> 00:34:00.780
the spirits of the congregation and of the church

704
00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.490
and of the community and the place.

705
00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:07.020
This hand would reach out and no.

706
00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.485
Every time I tried to draw a window, no.

707
00:34:09.485 --> 00:34:10.828
<v ->Interesting.</v>

708
00:34:10.828 --> 00:34:12.801
<v ->No window, no window!</v>

709
00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:14.828
(laughter)

710
00:34:14.828 --> 00:34:18.913
And so I go to the building committee meeting and say-

711
00:34:18.913 --> 00:34:20.534
<v ->My hand won't draw a window.</v>

712
00:34:20.534 --> 00:34:21.696
<v ->My hand won't draw a window.</v>

713
00:34:21.696 --> 00:34:22.880
(laughter)

714
00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:27.381
The other guys on the design committee won't let me.

715
00:34:28.871 --> 00:34:33.871
And what we came to was

716
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:37.952
clarity of intention means one thing at a time.

717
00:34:37.952 --> 00:34:40.159
There's a beautiful garden out there.

718
00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:43.850
There's a space in here for meditation,

719
00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:47.188
for ritual, for ceremony, for services.

720
00:34:47.188 --> 00:34:49.908
One thing at a time.

721
00:34:49.908 --> 00:34:54.153
So the narthex of a church which is sort of the entry

722
00:34:54.153 --> 00:34:57.066
which then goes usually into the sanctuary,

723
00:34:57.066 --> 00:35:00.169
I designed that so that it connected,

724
00:35:00.169 --> 00:35:02.259
created sacred space and acted as a gateway

725
00:35:02.259 --> 00:35:04.584
separately to the garden in one direction

726
00:35:04.584 --> 00:35:07.784
and to the sanctuary in a second direction.

727
00:35:07.784 --> 00:35:11.133
So you have them both but you can focus totally

728
00:35:11.133 --> 00:35:12.221
on each of them.

729
00:35:12.221 --> 00:35:13.053
<v ->Right.</v>

730
00:35:13.053 --> 00:35:15.314
<v ->And get that clarity, that coherence,</v>

731
00:35:15.314 --> 00:35:19.207
which is what empowers that energy realm of it.

732
00:35:19.207 --> 00:35:23.271
And then we put low windows around the sanctuary

733
00:35:23.271 --> 00:35:27.079
so you can't see out but we put like a moat, around

734
00:35:27.079 --> 00:35:30.312
that the water off the roof, as you're hearing now probably

735
00:35:30.312 --> 00:35:31.434
(laughs)

736
00:35:32.808 --> 00:35:35.302
fills this moat.

737
00:35:36.912 --> 00:35:39.354
You sit there and you don't feel trapped inside

738
00:35:39.354 --> 00:35:40.697
because you can feel the connection.

739
00:35:40.697 --> 00:35:42.670
There's water and you can see the

740
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:44.281
little wavelets sort of shimmering

741
00:35:44.281 --> 00:35:46.687
with the raindrops falling on it.

742
00:35:46.949 --> 00:35:50.521
And then when the sun comes out, it reflects off of that

743
00:35:50.521 --> 00:35:52.984
and reflects up on the ceiling inside

744
00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:55.278
and the whole ceiling will shimmer.

745
00:35:55.278 --> 00:36:00.278
And at times it becomes almost coherent infinity symbols,

746
00:36:01.923 --> 00:36:06.126
figure eights of light just floating on the ceiling.

747
00:36:06.126 --> 00:36:11.126
This brings a liveness into the space

748
00:36:11.395 --> 00:36:16.395
which came out of that, both the separation, the inner focus

749
00:36:16.547 --> 00:36:19.170
but then within that the connectedness

750
00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:20.801
of the integral consciousness.

751
00:36:20.801 --> 00:36:22.305
<v ->Beautiful.</v>

752
00:36:22.305 --> 00:36:25.158
Now you've also-

753
00:36:25.185 --> 00:36:26.678
<v ->I'm gonna interrupt you.</v>

754
00:36:26.678 --> 00:36:28.226
How does somebody do that in their house?

755
00:36:28.226 --> 00:36:28.833
<v ->Yeah.</v>

756
00:36:28.833 --> 00:36:31.596
Let's say that's not really an option, okay.

757
00:36:31.596 --> 00:36:34.689
Say you're going into a condo because you can afford it.

758
00:36:34.689 --> 00:36:36.128
There you go.

759
00:36:36.128 --> 00:36:37.861
<v ->Okay well,</v>

760
00:36:38.816 --> 00:36:40.300
the apartment I had in Minneapolis one time

761
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:44.203
when I was teaching, I was on the upper floor.

762
00:36:44.203 --> 00:36:46.314
There was a back door entrance and a little porch roof,

763
00:36:46.314 --> 00:36:49.056
flat porch roof out behind it.

764
00:36:49.056 --> 00:36:52.095
And after spring, fall I suddenly discovered,

765
00:36:52.095 --> 00:36:54.879
I was laying in bed one morning and I looked up

766
00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:57.738
and the whole ceiling had these circles on it.

767
00:36:57.738 --> 00:36:59.551
And it'd go bing.

768
00:36:59.551 --> 00:37:01.568
There was an icicle out there that was dropping

769
00:37:01.568 --> 00:37:05.545
a single drop into this still pool on the roof

770
00:37:05.545 --> 00:37:08.724
and these concentric circles would burst out from it.

771
00:37:08.724 --> 00:37:11.806
I just lay there all morning just looking at this.

772
00:37:11.806 --> 00:37:14.878
And this is something that you can do easily.

773
00:37:14.878 --> 00:37:19.336
Just have a basin of water in front of a window

774
00:37:19.336 --> 00:37:21.630
with something dropping water into it.

775
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.507
<v ->Right a simple little fountain.</v>

776
00:37:23.507 --> 00:37:25.043
<v ->It's the wrong example for most things but</v>

777
00:37:25.043 --> 00:37:28.691
to give the idea that there's ways to

778
00:37:28.691 --> 00:37:31.773
bring that kind of energy into a space.

779
00:37:31.773 --> 00:37:34.312
<v ->It really takes observation</v>

780
00:37:34.312 --> 00:37:39.207
and your intention in terms of what's important to you.

781
00:37:39.207 --> 00:37:39.954
<v ->Your awareness.</v>

782
00:37:39.954 --> 00:37:41.906
<v ->Your awareness, right.</v>

783
00:37:41.906 --> 00:37:44.135
Well one of the other things you talk about in your book

784
00:37:44.135 --> 00:37:47.057
that I like is when you're saying throw out your ideas

785
00:37:47.057 --> 00:37:49.127
of how a space can be utilized

786
00:37:49.127 --> 00:37:51.398
and you don't have to assume.

787
00:37:51.398 --> 00:37:52.466
You have a picture in there.

788
00:37:52.466 --> 00:37:54.022
It's just such a sweet little space.

789
00:37:54.022 --> 00:37:56.454
It's a kitchen nook that someone decided

790
00:37:56.454 --> 00:37:58.875
no, I love this place, this is my bedroom.

791
00:37:58.875 --> 00:38:01.702
And they changed a kitchen nook to their bedroom.

792
00:38:01.702 --> 00:38:03.792
Can you talk a little bit about our preconceived notions

793
00:38:03.792 --> 00:38:05.358
about how space is to be used

794
00:38:05.358 --> 00:38:07.149
and what we actually could do.

795
00:38:07.149 --> 00:38:09.734
<v ->Well that is a condo that you just moved me into.</v>

796
00:38:09.734 --> 00:38:10.813
(laughter)

797
00:38:10.813 --> 00:38:12.947
It was a place that we rented in Salem.

798
00:38:15.607 --> 00:38:18.566
It didn't have much to connect with the outside world

799
00:38:18.566 --> 00:38:21.563
but it had this little dining nook off the kitchen

800
00:38:21.563 --> 00:38:23.792
with windows around, it was not leaded pane

801
00:38:23.792 --> 00:38:28.016
but narrow paned windows around three sides of it.

802
00:38:28.016 --> 00:38:29.264
There were casements that all opened out

803
00:38:29.264 --> 00:38:30.480
and there was plants outside.

804
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.058
Just a lovely little spot.

805
00:38:32.058 --> 00:38:34.490
And this is where I want to be.

806
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:36.539
I don't care if it's part of the kitchen.

807
00:38:36.539 --> 00:38:38.928
I mean now we live with our bed in the living room

808
00:38:38.928 --> 00:38:40.228
almost of our house.

809
00:38:40.228 --> 00:38:42.020
<v ->I know, we'll take a look at that. (laughs)</v>

810
00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.570
<v ->And you know, just erase the labels off of things</v>

811
00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:48.676
and say what feels best for each part of your life.

812
00:38:48.676 --> 00:38:51.161
Somebody was saying the other day that

813
00:38:51.161 --> 00:38:53.486
a way of starting is asking people

814
00:38:53.486 --> 00:38:56.291
what do you do in your house?

815
00:38:56.291 --> 00:38:58.531
And how much time do you spend doing this and this and this

816
00:38:58.531 --> 00:39:00.431
and what does it need?

817
00:39:00.431 --> 00:39:02.595
How many people wake up early

818
00:39:02.595 --> 00:39:04.216
and like to sit in the sun with a cup of coffee

819
00:39:04.216 --> 00:39:05.400
or something?

820
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.257
How many are late nighters,

821
00:39:07.257 --> 00:39:10.925
or like to sit around the dining table at sunset

822
00:39:10.925 --> 00:39:12.461
and watch the sun go down?

823
00:39:12.461 --> 00:39:16.429
In this case you'd move the house or move how you use it

824
00:39:16.429 --> 00:39:19.917
differently, depending on who you are, things you love,

825
00:39:19.917 --> 00:39:22.210
the patterns that you're dealing with.

826
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:24.418
<v ->Well and even before you do that,</v>

827
00:39:24.418 --> 00:39:27.617
people hearing this interview, choose.

828
00:39:27.617 --> 00:39:30.124
Choose the place that you're going to move into accordingly.

829
00:39:30.124 --> 00:39:32.470
If you're a morning person and you like that morning sun

830
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:34.305
coming in and while you have your cup of coffee

831
00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:36.556
or your tea, then you want to start looking for that.

832
00:39:36.556 --> 00:39:40.620
So start becoming aware of what it is your being needs

833
00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:41.858
when you're looking for a place.

834
00:39:41.858 --> 00:39:43.532
Not just where you can put your stuff

835
00:39:43.532 --> 00:39:45.751
or fit all of your stuff.

836
00:39:45.751 --> 00:39:47.776
And that brings us really more into the

837
00:39:47.776 --> 00:39:52.704
spiritual aspect of how we choose to structure our lives

838
00:39:52.704 --> 00:39:54.699
and one of the things you commented on,

839
00:39:54.699 --> 00:39:57.898
I noticed several times on your website and this book,

840
00:39:57.898 --> 00:40:01.247
Building With The Breath Of Life, is that

841
00:40:01.247 --> 00:40:05.514
because we have, as a natural outcropping of our

842
00:40:05.514 --> 00:40:07.839
rapid growth and aggressive growth,

843
00:40:07.839 --> 00:40:11.210
really become very disconnected from the givingness of life.

844
00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:13.877
We're taking too much and we're giving too little.

845
00:40:13.877 --> 00:40:16.318
Can you talk about that a little bit?

846
00:40:16.318 --> 00:40:17.823
I mean even to the point where we go out and

847
00:40:17.823 --> 00:40:20.563
buy more stuff rather than take care of a house plant

848
00:40:20.563 --> 00:40:22.814
that's sitting right there and needing to be watered

849
00:40:22.814 --> 00:40:23.998
that we already bought.

850
00:40:23.998 --> 00:40:25.811
Let it die and get another one at Target, right?

851
00:40:25.811 --> 00:40:28.691
But that whole mentality and how we start

852
00:40:28.691 --> 00:40:31.379
making the subtle shifts.

853
00:40:31.379 --> 00:40:33.683
<v ->Sometimes that stuff just, you trip over</v>

854
00:40:33.683 --> 00:40:35.336
and bump into it and say,

855
00:40:36.836 --> 00:40:38.818
"How could I have been so blind?"

856
00:40:38.818 --> 00:40:42.817
And I was sitting with a client putting together the

857
00:40:42.817 --> 00:40:44.854
program for our project.

858
00:40:44.854 --> 00:40:48.033
And they're saying well we want this, I want this,

859
00:40:48.033 --> 00:40:50.517
I want this, writing down I want this, I want this,

860
00:40:50.517 --> 00:40:51.840
I want this.

861
00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.376
And suddenly I was just hearing

862
00:40:53.376 --> 00:40:55.765
I want, I want, I want, I want.

863
00:40:55.765 --> 00:40:57.952
And the circuits fried.

864
00:40:57.952 --> 00:41:02.058
And I said, "Well wait a minute.

865
00:41:02.058 --> 00:41:05.748
"Let's try this backwards and say what can we give?

866
00:41:05.748 --> 00:41:07.936
"Let's just be curious."

867
00:41:07.936 --> 00:41:12.936
Try it on and see if we approach something differently.

868
00:41:13.749 --> 00:41:16.116
And we look at the project and say,

869
00:41:16.116 --> 00:41:19.412
"Oh, well we need a retaining wall along the sidewalk here

870
00:41:19.412 --> 00:41:22.409
"or something but it we make that sitting height,

871
00:41:22.409 --> 00:41:25.502
"we're giving a place for people to sit."

872
00:41:25.502 --> 00:41:30.345
And well we don't just want to do landscaping

873
00:41:30.345 --> 00:41:31.881
just to make the building look pretty.

874
00:41:31.881 --> 00:41:34.696
If we plant some trees along the street,

875
00:41:34.696 --> 00:41:38.213
we can cool the whole street and make it wonderful.

876
00:41:38.213 --> 00:41:40.657
We can bring the birds in and make them

877
00:41:40.657 --> 00:41:42.832
part of what we hear inside the building.

878
00:41:42.832 --> 00:41:46.043
So giving things to the birds, giving things to the people.

879
00:41:46.043 --> 00:41:49.007
A pathway through a project to connect things

880
00:41:49.007 --> 00:41:52.143
on one side to the other.

881
00:41:55.243 --> 00:41:57.977
Nature works in wholeness.

882
00:41:57.977 --> 00:42:00.165
And we're used to an engineering approach

883
00:42:00.165 --> 00:42:02.810
of dealing with one thing at a time.

884
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:06.436
We've got a toilet, or we didn't have toilets in those days,

885
00:42:06.436 --> 00:42:08.644
we had a chamber pot, what do we do with it?

886
00:42:08.644 --> 00:42:10.361
Oh, we throw it out the window.

887
00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:12.419
Well that doesn't get too nice for the neighbors.

888
00:42:12.419 --> 00:42:16.224
Okay, well, okay so we develop the flush toilet.

889
00:42:16.224 --> 00:42:17.920
Well what do you do with all the sewage?

890
00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:22.540
Ah, run the pipe over the river, get rid of it.

891
00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.768
What about the people downstream?

892
00:42:24.768 --> 00:42:26.816
The people upstream are doing that to you?

893
00:42:26.816 --> 00:42:29.162
We're not thinking about things wholistically,

894
00:42:29.162 --> 00:42:33.247
we're just paying attention to one thing at a time.

895
00:42:33.247 --> 00:42:36.820
But everything is connected in networks and webs and things.

896
00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.520
And you know you can't even disturb one piece of it

897
00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.601
without changing all those connections.

898
00:42:42.601 --> 00:42:47.601
So when we look at it in wholes, we find that

899
00:42:48.638 --> 00:42:53.638
what nourishes everything nourishes us even more, the most.

900
00:42:55.028 --> 00:42:57.672
Because if we're surrounded by health and vitality,

901
00:42:57.672 --> 00:42:59.595
that feeds us.

902
00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:04.454
<v ->Yes and we're starving to death.</v>

903
00:43:04.454 --> 00:43:05.426
<v ->Yeah.</v>

904
00:43:05.426 --> 00:43:06.843
<v ->As a culture, we're starving to death.</v>

905
00:43:06.843 --> 00:43:08.745
<v ->Literally, the-</v>

906
00:43:08.745 --> 00:43:12.329
I saw something six months ago, a study done

907
00:43:12.329 --> 00:43:16.297
about the nutritional value of wheat has dropped

908
00:43:16.297 --> 00:43:20.383
from 90% protein to 9% in the last hundred years.

909
00:43:20.383 --> 00:43:24.659
Apples and fruits have lost 80% of their nutrients

910
00:43:24.659 --> 00:43:27.464
because we look at outsides.

911
00:43:27.464 --> 00:43:29.693
We look just at how things look,

912
00:43:29.693 --> 00:43:31.730
things that could be copied easily.

913
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:33.992
You buy the pretty apple, you buy the

914
00:43:35.822 --> 00:43:37.895
bread that looks good on the outside.

915
00:43:37.895 --> 00:43:42.610
But the wheat that was used in the bread

916
00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:47.610
was grown with artificial fertilizers in depleted soils

917
00:43:48.199 --> 00:43:51.826
and so they were able to create more volume

918
00:43:51.826 --> 00:43:56.826
of wheat or bread out of it but it's the same amount of

919
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:58.747
nutrition that was available to begin with.

920
00:43:58.747 --> 00:44:01.510
So it's thinned out and thinned out and thinned out

921
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:03.878
and you select for what things look like

922
00:44:03.878 --> 00:44:07.131
rather than what the nutritional value.

923
00:44:07.131 --> 00:44:09.797
And I mean that's spiritually as well as just food wise.

924
00:44:09.797 --> 00:44:11.120
<v ->That's what we do with each other.</v>

925
00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:11.814
<v ->Yeah.</v>

926
00:44:11.814 --> 00:44:14.298
<v ->You put on nice clothes, you put on some makeup,</v>

927
00:44:14.298 --> 00:44:17.232
little bit of hair preparation stuff

928
00:44:17.232 --> 00:44:19.269
and that's how we actually view each other.

929
00:44:19.269 --> 00:44:20.474
<v ->Yeah.</v>

930
00:44:20.474 --> 00:44:23.727
And that came right back into architecture for me.

931
00:44:23.727 --> 00:44:28.324
I mean earlier it happened but the concept.

932
00:44:28.324 --> 00:44:30.832
I read a thing in the newspaper about

933
00:44:30.832 --> 00:44:33.668
they were excited that some class went together

934
00:44:33.668 --> 00:44:36.526
to raise money to buy a mirror for this little girl

935
00:44:36.526 --> 00:44:38.916
that didn't have a mirror at home.

936
00:44:38.916 --> 00:44:42.019
I mean I thought, you know, how embarrassing for her.

937
00:44:42.019 --> 00:44:46.808
Did she look so unkempt that they, you know.

938
00:44:46.808 --> 00:44:51.808
But then I realized, how do we do our bathrooms?

939
00:44:52.312 --> 00:44:54.285
Wall to wall mirrors.

940
00:44:54.285 --> 00:44:58.189
And that focuses us on outsides again, on how things look,

941
00:44:58.189 --> 00:45:00.322
superficial things.

942
00:45:00.322 --> 00:45:02.157
What if we take them out?

943
00:45:02.157 --> 00:45:05.869
So 30 years ago when I built our house here

944
00:45:07.839 --> 00:45:09.548
I took the mirrors out of the bathroom

945
00:45:09.548 --> 00:45:12.119
and I put a window in over the lavatory.

946
00:45:12.119 --> 00:45:14.540
And you go in there in the morning,

947
00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:17.026
you stagger into the bathroom hungover or whatever

948
00:45:17.026 --> 00:45:20.834
and if you look in the mirror, you get a real good

949
00:45:20.834 --> 00:45:22.337
self-esteem boost.

950
00:45:22.337 --> 00:45:24.268
Ugh!

951
00:45:24.268 --> 00:45:26.198
But if you go in the bathroom and you look out and say,

952
00:45:26.198 --> 00:45:28.513
"Oh, look at the sunlight, the water drops on the-"

953
00:45:28.513 --> 00:45:29.399
<v ->I noticed that.</v>

954
00:45:29.399 --> 00:45:31.628
I used your bathroom I thought, "Oh this is beautiful."

955
00:45:31.628 --> 00:45:34.112
You're looking out on ferns and trees.

956
00:45:34.112 --> 00:45:35.477
<v ->And you go,"Ahh!"</v>

957
00:45:35.477 --> 00:45:38.827
And then you are ahh instead of ugh.

958
00:45:38.827 --> 00:45:40.501
<v ->Instead of automatically having your face</v>

959
00:45:40.501 --> 00:45:42.049
staring back at you.

960
00:45:42.049 --> 00:45:43.029
<v ->Yeah.</v>

961
00:45:43.029 --> 00:45:45.674
<v ->What a limited vision out into the world.</v>

962
00:45:45.674 --> 00:45:47.531
<v ->So that doesn't mean you can't use a mirror.</v>

963
00:45:47.531 --> 00:45:49.088
I put them on the inside of medicine cabinets

964
00:45:49.088 --> 00:45:50.923
or on the back of doors or things.

965
00:45:50.923 --> 00:45:54.197
But, again, it's our cultural values that say

966
00:45:54.197 --> 00:45:59.146
wall to wall mirrors, think of in terms of surface qualities

967
00:45:59.146 --> 00:46:02.047
of things rather than inner qualities.

968
00:46:02.047 --> 00:46:04.180
And once we start focusing on inner qualities,

969
00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:08.621
once our attention is not focused by our

970
00:46:08.621 --> 00:46:11.212
computer peripherals on those surface things

971
00:46:11.212 --> 00:46:14.978
then we do focus more inward and we feel

972
00:46:14.978 --> 00:46:18.295
how we feel about people and how we feel

973
00:46:18.295 --> 00:46:21.110
and pay attention to that rather than how things look.

974
00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:24.641
We look to the realities, not to the aesthetics.

975
00:46:24.641 --> 00:46:28.389
<v ->And in general it's time to start giving again.</v>

976
00:46:29.696 --> 00:46:32.118
Any further comment on that one?

977
00:46:32.118 --> 00:46:35.317
<v ->Well I've probably worn out the paper with</v>

978
00:46:35.317 --> 00:46:38.453
quoting Malidoma Some on that.

979
00:46:38.453 --> 00:46:42.954
He talks about, in his autobiography, Of Water and Spirit,

980
00:46:42.954 --> 00:46:47.350
about how work in the Dagara village

981
00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:49.049
was done communally.

982
00:46:49.049 --> 00:46:50.137
<v ->I love that story.</v>

983
00:46:50.137 --> 00:46:51.598
Can you tell us that story?

984
00:46:51.598 --> 00:46:54.947
<v ->Well he talks in one place about women making pottery</v>

985
00:46:54.947 --> 00:46:57.848
and that they sit around, singing and dancing

986
00:46:57.848 --> 00:47:00.173
and having a good time together and

987
00:47:00.173 --> 00:47:02.424
you know working the mud and getting it ready

988
00:47:02.424 --> 00:47:05.625
and nothing happens and things just go on.

989
00:47:05.625 --> 00:47:06.925
And suddenly at the end of the day,

990
00:47:06.925 --> 00:47:11.925
a flurry of pots just happen and they are beautiful

991
00:47:12.387 --> 00:47:13.943
and they're connected and they have

992
00:47:13.943 --> 00:47:16.908
wonderful imagery and things on them.

993
00:47:16.908 --> 00:47:21.228
But he says that work to them-

994
00:47:21.228 --> 00:47:23.670
Nourishment does not come after the work,

995
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:27.244
it comes before and during through the work.

996
00:47:27.244 --> 00:47:31.979
That it is the raise in the energy is what is important.

997
00:47:31.979 --> 00:47:34.327
And then out of that energy, being able to do

998
00:47:34.327 --> 00:47:35.905
what has to be done, the working the fields

999
00:47:35.905 --> 00:47:38.113
or making the pots or whatever.

1000
00:47:38.113 --> 00:47:40.597
And then it's fun and doing it together-

1001
00:47:40.597 --> 00:47:44.117
The most wonderful times I've experienced,

1002
00:47:44.117 --> 00:47:49.109
one of these was a day that a bunch of people got together

1003
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:53.803
and planted over 800 trees on a salmon race racing project.

1004
00:47:53.803 --> 00:47:57.077
Energy of that was just amazing, people working together.

1005
00:47:57.077 --> 00:48:02.077
Another time was barn raising a school.

1006
00:48:03.331 --> 00:48:06.146
The kids and the parents all together literally

1007
00:48:06.146 --> 00:48:07.981
tipping the walls up into place

1008
00:48:07.981 --> 00:48:11.117
and the feeling of accomplishment that comes with that.

1009
00:48:11.117 --> 00:48:14.019
That sense of working together is wonderful

1010
00:48:14.019 --> 00:48:15.682
and that is where you're giving.

1011
00:48:15.682 --> 00:48:20.682
And also when in our communities,

1012
00:48:21.048 --> 00:48:23.884
it's a poor community, it's a seasonal community

1013
00:48:23.884 --> 00:48:27.393
and particularly during the winter everybody's

1014
00:48:27.393 --> 00:48:29.549
half unemployed.

1015
00:48:29.549 --> 00:48:32.523
And so there's a huge volunteer component

1016
00:48:32.523 --> 00:48:36.299
to our community which is based on giving.

1017
00:48:36.299 --> 00:48:38.859
People have the time, they don't have the money.

1018
00:48:38.859 --> 00:48:43.275
So they get together and somebody drives the

1019
00:48:43.275 --> 00:48:47.221
bus for old people that can't drive a car anymore

1020
00:48:47.221 --> 00:48:48.490
and somebody else works in the food bank

1021
00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:51.424
and somebody else does this and somebody else does that.

1022
00:48:51.424 --> 00:48:53.699
All these things together,

1023
00:48:55.795 --> 00:48:58.419
it's totally different energy to giving

1024
00:48:58.419 --> 00:49:01.672
than to an exchange based on money or something

1025
00:49:01.672 --> 00:49:06.525
because when you're giving, you've given from surplus

1026
00:49:06.525 --> 00:49:10.217
and the person who's receiving,

1027
00:49:10.217 --> 00:49:12.605
"Oh, what a wonderful gift you gave me."

1028
00:49:12.605 --> 00:49:15.581
And you say oh, it felt so good and you're getting,

1029
00:49:15.581 --> 00:49:16.946
you add up the points on everything

1030
00:49:16.946 --> 00:49:19.292
and you end up with 200%.

1031
00:49:19.292 --> 00:49:22.663
<v ->Yes, you feel both ways.</v>

1032
00:49:22.663 --> 00:49:27.602
Respected and respectful and nurturing and nurtured.

1033
00:49:28.672 --> 00:49:29.747
<v ->And grateful.</v>

1034
00:49:29.747 --> 00:49:31.165
<v ->And grateful, yes.</v>

1035
00:49:31.165 --> 00:49:33.555
<v ->And often what we give are things we're not really</v>

1036
00:49:33.555 --> 00:49:35.593
aware of the value to other people

1037
00:49:35.593 --> 00:49:39.794
because we've had them and so not having them,

1038
00:49:39.794 --> 00:49:41.886
we're often more aware of what we don't have

1039
00:49:41.886 --> 00:49:45.064
than what we do have because we get too familiar with it.

1040
00:49:45.064 --> 00:49:49.383
And so we're giving something that we undervalue

1041
00:49:49.383 --> 00:49:51.708
and that other people value more so,

1042
00:49:51.708 --> 00:49:56.210
again, the points add up to several hundred percent.

1043
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:59.004
<v ->Yes and so we, the message is we just begin.</v>

1044
00:49:59.004 --> 00:50:00.924
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1045
00:50:00.924 --> 00:50:02.918
And one of the images that we had,

1046
00:50:02.918 --> 00:50:05.777
I guess it was last month on our feng shui calendar,

1047
00:50:05.777 --> 00:50:10.777
was that the economics of nature is extravagance.

1048
00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.291
<v ->Beautiful.</v>

1049
00:50:13.291 --> 00:50:18.261
<v ->That is how a plant gets the next generation.</v>

1050
00:50:18.261 --> 00:50:22.485
It gives this beautiful thing that attracts the hummingbirds

1051
00:50:22.485 --> 00:50:24.971
or the bees.

1052
00:50:24.971 --> 00:50:26.431
<v ->That's so perfectly put.</v>

1053
00:50:26.431 --> 00:50:28.639
You think about how much of the time

1054
00:50:28.639 --> 00:50:30.539
for that beautiful blossom of the year

1055
00:50:30.539 --> 00:50:32.490
is spent in gestation.

1056
00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:35.508
Just the gathering the forces, the gathering and so forth

1057
00:50:35.508 --> 00:50:38.965
until finally the intention, the time, everything's set

1058
00:50:38.965 --> 00:50:42.889
and it bursts forth in this extravagant display.

1059
00:50:42.889 --> 00:50:44.894
And we can't give that to ourselves.

1060
00:50:44.894 --> 00:50:46.868
We've got to just grind it out.

1061
00:50:46.868 --> 00:50:49.491
Hopefully we'll earn a little bit of reward

1062
00:50:49.491 --> 00:50:52.019
at the end of the day or at the end of the month.

1063
00:50:52.019 --> 00:50:54.665
<v ->Yeah, doesn't work.</v>

1064
00:50:54.665 --> 00:50:56.168
It should be pretty obvious by now.

1065
00:50:56.168 --> 00:50:57.587
(laughter)

1066
00:50:57.587 --> 00:51:00.029
(ethereal music)

1067
00:51:00.029 --> 00:51:01.394
<v ->To get a copy of one of his books</v>

1068
00:51:01.394 --> 00:51:04.093
please click on the link to his website below.

1069
00:51:04.093 --> 00:51:06.952
I found Building With The Breath of Fire to be a work of art

1070
00:51:06.952 --> 00:51:10.227
on all levels with enough consciousness folded into it

1071
00:51:10.227 --> 00:51:12.220
to last many a lifetime.

1072
00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:14.674
Until next time, thanks for watching.
