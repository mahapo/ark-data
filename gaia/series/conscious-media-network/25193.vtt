1
00:00:12.052 --> 00:00:14.646
<v ->There are people on this planet who incarnated</v>

2
00:00:14.646 --> 00:00:17.656
with abilities most of us are not yet equipped with.

3
00:00:17.656 --> 00:00:20.890
Mr. Trivedi, a native of India, is one such person.

4
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.055
He was living the privileged life of a guru not long ago,

5
00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:26.669
when he realized that the energy he's endowed with

6
00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.525
would be better utilized by offering it

7
00:00:28.525 --> 00:00:31.352
for study and use in the Western world.

8
00:00:31.352 --> 00:00:34.304
His unique abilities allow him to focus and project

9
00:00:34.304 --> 00:00:36.396
massive amounts of healing energy,

10
00:00:36.396 --> 00:00:38.860
enough to reach thousands of people in a crowd

11
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.137
to charge seeds for healthy crops

12
00:00:41.137 --> 00:00:43.974
and heal orchards of unhealthy fruit trees,

13
00:00:43.974 --> 00:00:45.339
bodies of polluted water,

14
00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.803
just about anything else that is out of balance.

15
00:00:47.803 --> 00:00:49.653
His abilities and his body have been

16
00:00:49.653 --> 00:00:52.202
the subject of a number of university studies

17
00:00:52.202 --> 00:00:56.099
and his work has become known as The Trivedi Effect.

18
00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.260
<v Regina>So Mr. Trivedi,</v>

19
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.387
you had a very different kind of childhood.

20
00:01:09.387 --> 00:01:10.536
<v ->Yes.</v>

21
00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:12.636
<v ->And how did these,</v>

22
00:01:12.636 --> 00:01:15.627
How did this energy that comes through you

23
00:01:15.627 --> 00:01:19.149
show itself when you were a little child?

24
00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.255 line:15% 
That what wasn't going to happen?

25
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.136 line:15% 
He said, "He'll be a failure in his,"

26
00:02:13.136 --> 00:02:15.100 line:15% 
so they're talking about somebody else

27
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.582 line:15% 
and your five-years-old.
<v ->Yes.</v>

28
00:02:16.582 --> 00:02:17.571 line:15% 
<v ->And your making comments,</v>

29
00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:18.443 line:15% 
"I think you're wrong,
<v ->You're right.</v>

30
00:02:18.443 --> 00:02:20.719 line:15% 
I think he's going to be a failure."

31
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.295
<v ->Now in India don't you normally,</v>

32
00:02:36.295 --> 00:02:38.372
don't most families have a guru who comes

33
00:02:38.372 --> 00:02:42.736
and blesses the child at birth and does and understand

34
00:02:42.736 --> 00:02:44.516
the astrology and such for the family?

35
00:02:44.516 --> 00:02:47.400 line:15% 
Was any of that done for you when you are baby?

36
00:03:20.595 --> 00:03:21.896 line:15% 
<v ->Well, that's a good motivation.</v>

37
00:03:21.896 --> 00:03:22.962
You don't want a beating.

38
00:03:22.962 --> 00:03:26.976
So you followed the ways that they imposed on the family.

39
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.282 line:15% 
<v ->An angel on this planet for a wife.</v>

40
00:04:49.273 --> 00:04:51.028
<v ->Very pragmatic child.</v>

41
00:04:51.028 --> 00:04:55.522
Now did your abilities to your intuitive abilities to

42
00:04:55.522 --> 00:04:57.706
that you were using, telling your family about,

43
00:04:57.706 --> 00:04:59.892
"No, you're wrong about this and that and the other thing."

44
00:04:59.892 --> 00:05:02.349
Did this bother your parents or were they?

45
00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:32.522 line:15% 
<v ->They stole you from somewhere.</v>

46
00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:42.434 line:15% 
<v ->Nothing matched.</v>

47
00:06:05.067 --> 00:06:08.142 line:15% 
<v ->A prayer and a puja is how to cheat another?</v>

48
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.160 line:15% 
<v ->I've only been to India for a few weeks.</v>

49
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.391 line:15% 
I didn't get that part.

50
00:06:15.391 --> 00:06:17.053 line:15% 
I didn't understand a thing (chuckles).

51
00:06:17.053 --> 00:06:18.375
<v ->How to fool others.</v>

52
00:06:18.375 --> 00:06:20.778
That is the concept of the prayer and puja.

53
00:06:20.778 --> 00:06:24.263
<v ->Now we have to go into the more adult part from here.</v>

54
00:06:24.263 --> 00:06:26.369
So you went through school, electrical engineering.

55
00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:28.588
You said you went about 10% of the time.

56
00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:30.303
And that you've had it.

57
00:07:03.498 --> 00:07:05.471 line:15% 
<v ->So you wasted your five years.</v>

58
00:07:11.403 --> 00:07:12.694 line:15% 
<v ->Engineering?</v>

59
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.985 line:15% 
<v ->You got a National Merit Scholarship</v>

60
00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:34.349 line:15% 
even though you only went to school about

61
00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:36.586 line:15% 
(chuckles) 10% of the time?

62
00:08:10.553 --> 00:08:12.395 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, very boring.</v>

63
00:08:49.157 --> 00:08:50.977
<v ->So I have a question.</v>

64
00:08:50.977 --> 00:08:55.977 line:15% 
Why did you choose to incarnate into a culture

65
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.369 line:15% 
that doesn't necessarily promote liberty

66
00:08:58.369 --> 00:09:00.410 line:15% 
and freedom in a family?

67
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.042 line:15% 
Do you know now in hindsight

68
00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:05.467 line:15% 
why you chose this incarnation path?

69
00:09:05.467 --> 00:09:06.830
<v ->Yes.</v>

70
00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:24.244 line:15% 
<v ->What's "Nomber?"</v>

71
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.287 line:15% 
<v ->November 1995.</v>

72
00:09:36.087 --> 00:09:38.031 line:15% 
<v ->To play your role, ok.</v>

73
00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:40.126 line:15% 
<v ->Awakening.</v>

74
00:10:17.234 --> 00:10:18.965 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, powerful mind.</v>

75
00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.526 line:15% 
<v ->With this incredible power of intention.</v>

76
00:11:28.316 --> 00:11:31.264 line:15% 
<v ->Getting the answers from an unknown source?</v>

77
00:11:31.264 --> 00:11:33.336 line:15% 
To your questions or?

78
00:11:53.557 --> 00:11:55.960 line:15% 
Zero field, Zero-Point field.

79
00:12:33.348 --> 00:12:34.878 line:15% 
No value in women?

80
00:12:55.016 --> 00:12:56.791 line:15% 
Verbal abuse.

81
00:13:11.915 --> 00:13:13.225 line:15% 
Really?

82
00:13:20.863 --> 00:13:23.711 line:15% 
70,000 people have come to you for blessings?

83
00:13:45.774 --> 00:13:46.844 line:15% 
To the souls?

84
00:13:46.844 --> 00:13:49.317
<v ->Source, S-O-U-R-C-E.</v>

85
00:13:49.317 --> 00:13:51.519
<v ->Source, source, ok.</v>

86
00:14:06.792 --> 00:14:09.085
<v ->You can learn something from here?</v>

87
00:14:26.254 --> 00:14:28.851 line:15% 
<v ->Conspiracy, criminals.</v>

88
00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:52.663 line:15% 
And so you chose this path.

89
00:14:52.663 --> 00:14:55.149 line:15% 
Now you go on to your path and you're

90
00:14:55.149 --> 00:14:57.993 line:15% 
now beginning to do your work in the world.

91
00:14:57.993 --> 00:15:01.770
You're doing these transmissions in which you bring through

92
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:06.399
extraordinary amounts of a very, very high-refined energy.

93
00:15:07.358 --> 00:15:10.514
Just being in the room when you came in the room last week

94
00:15:10.514 --> 00:15:12.189
when I was there for a lecture to

95
00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:13.852
check you out and see who you are,

96
00:15:13.852 --> 00:15:15.761
I could immediately feel things happening

97
00:15:15.761 --> 00:15:19.088
around the top of the head and throughout my aura and such

98
00:15:19.088 --> 00:15:21.295
as you came in and started talking.

99
00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:24.178
And you weren't doing anything specific.

100
00:15:24.178 --> 00:15:25.377
But it was an energy that you were

101
00:15:25.377 --> 00:15:27.026
bringing through and carrying with you.

102
00:15:27.026 --> 00:15:29.669
So it's very pronounced energy.

103
00:15:29.669 --> 00:15:32.002
And so when you begin, now this is interesting

104
00:15:32.002 --> 00:15:35.025
because you became a guru essentially.

105
00:15:35.025 --> 00:15:36.645
I've seen your pictures.

106
00:15:36.645 --> 00:15:38.446
You have all the colorful robes on,

107
00:15:38.446 --> 00:15:39.704
people kissing your feet,

108
00:15:39.704 --> 00:15:43.629
surrounded by thousands of people and everything.

109
00:15:43.633 --> 00:15:45.579
That's a good gig.

110
00:17:26.371 --> 00:17:27.647 line:15% 
Very good data?

111
00:17:27.647 --> 00:17:29.691 line:15% 
You mean in good results from people.

112
00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:41.704 line:15% 
Fibromyalgia.

113
00:17:53.212 --> 00:17:55.185 line:15% 
Menstrual cycles, yes.

114
00:18:09.294 --> 00:18:13.200 line:15% 
So you were getting repeatable results

115
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.580 line:15% 
and verifiable results repeatedly with these

116
00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.000 line:15% 
many thousands of people obviously.

117
00:18:20.702 --> 00:18:22.184 line:15% 
But you were really exalted.

118
00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:23.207 line:15% 
When you would go to India,

119
00:18:23.207 --> 00:18:26.961 line:15% 
you were living like a guru, like a king.

120
00:18:26.961 --> 00:18:27.849
<v ->Yes.</v>

121
00:18:28.422 --> 00:18:31.138 line:15% 
<v ->That's a lot to walk away from on one level,</v>

122
00:18:31.138 --> 00:18:35.032 line:15% 
for an ordinary person doing blessings.

123
00:18:35.032 --> 00:18:36.661 line:15% 
That would be a hard thing to walk away from

124
00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:38.456 line:15% 
because you were set.

125
00:18:53.179 --> 00:18:54.526 line:15% 
Robes, yeah.

126
00:19:33.283 --> 00:19:35.679 line:15% 
With a navy blue suit.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

127
00:20:07.573 --> 00:20:10.022 line:15% 
<v ->That's a good friend to have, you.</v>

128
00:20:15.435 --> 00:20:17.221 line:15% 
Success and failure.

129
00:20:32.697 --> 00:20:33.759 line:15% 
Finished this kind of what?

130
00:20:33.759 --> 00:20:36.772
<v ->This kind of role, R-O-L-E, role.</v>

131
00:20:36.772 --> 00:20:38.531 line:15% 
<v ->Role, yes, yes.</v>

132
00:21:24.175 --> 00:21:27.424 line:15% 
<v ->Some of it's actually, show.</v>

133
00:21:27.424 --> 00:21:28.423 line:15% 
It's not real.

134
00:21:28.423 --> 00:21:31.227 line:15% 
I mean, there are some frauds.
<v ->Not some, mostly.</v>

135
00:21:31.227 --> 00:21:32.439
<v ->Mostly frauds, yes.</v>

136
00:21:32.439 --> 00:21:34.913
I've read books about how these little,

137
00:21:34.913 --> 00:21:36.828
"miracles" are produced.

138
00:23:02.288 --> 00:23:03.465 line:15% 
<v ->May.</v>

139
00:23:30.532 --> 00:23:31.976 line:15% 
<v ->They're very great what?</v>

140
00:23:31.996 --> 00:23:33.230
<v ->Great masters.</v>

141
00:23:33.547 --> 00:23:34.924
<v ->Great masters.</v>

142
00:23:34.924 --> 00:23:38.918
But, in fact, scientifically their phenomena

143
00:23:38.918 --> 00:23:41.519
turned out to be very average in nature.

144
00:24:14.756 --> 00:24:16.283 line:15% 
There you go.

145
00:24:46.403 --> 00:24:48.104 line:15% 
Yes, live blood cell.

146
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.344 line:15% 
<v ->Healthy antibodies.</v>

147
00:25:07.344 --> 00:25:09.872 line:15% 
<v ->Yeah, healthy antibody around the blood cell.</v>

148
00:25:28.884 --> 00:25:30.435 line:15% 
<v ->They forwarded it.</v>

149
00:25:39.229 --> 00:25:40.613 line:15% 
His name is Blayne Costello?

150
00:25:40.613 --> 00:25:42.842
<v ->Dr. Brian Costello.</v>

151
00:25:42.842 --> 00:25:44.794
<v ->Oh, Brian Costello.</v>

152
00:25:44.794 --> 00:25:49.747
<v ->From Australia, Melbourne, he invited me in 2004.</v>

153
00:26:41.372 --> 00:26:42.555 line:15% 
<v ->But your body actually</v>

154
00:26:42.555 --> 00:26:44.221 line:15% 
is wired differently
<v ->Yeah, I'm coming.</v>

155
00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:10.137 line:15% 
<v ->Right, they'll melt.</v>

156
00:28:01.818 --> 00:28:03.785 line:15% 
Very miraculous thing?

157
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.749 line:15% 
<v ->Yes!</v>

158
00:28:35.709 --> 00:28:39.607 line:15% 
One oversees the other and it's a back and forth dance.

159
00:28:54.281 --> 00:28:57.673 line:15% 
Would that be like in a deep theta state

160
00:28:57.673 --> 00:29:00.673 line:15% 
and a high gamma at the same time more or less?

161
00:29:00.673 --> 00:29:01.983
<v ->Yes.
<v ->Yes, ok.</v>

162
00:29:01.983 --> 00:29:03.252
<v ->Yes.</v>

163
00:29:03.252 --> 00:29:06.114 line:15% 
<v ->Normally you don't do that at the same time.</v>

164
00:29:29.586 --> 00:29:30.965 line:15% 
Simultaneously.

165
00:30:00.651 --> 00:30:03.046 line:15% 
Trivedi Foundation Energy.

166
00:30:04.186 --> 00:30:06.496
<v ->That is available on like this.</v>

167
00:30:06.496 --> 00:30:09.974 line:15% 
<v ->All these reports about your physiology from the ...</v>

168
00:30:14.737 --> 00:30:18.286 line:15% 
They've been able to validate that you're wired differently.

169
00:30:18.286 --> 00:30:19.891 line:15% 
And then what?

170
00:30:34.559 --> 00:30:36.927 line:15% 
Medical Infrared Digital Imaging.

171
00:30:36.927 --> 00:30:38.062 line:15% 
<v ->Yes.</v>

172
00:31:18.825 --> 00:31:20.979 line:15% 
<v ->The elasticity of the cells.</v>

173
00:31:21.928 --> 00:31:23.726 line:15% 
Very important.

174
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.745 line:15% 
Say it again, the rhythm of the what?

175
00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:55.011 line:15% 
CSF.

176
00:31:57.266 --> 00:31:59.734 line:15% 
Cerebral Spinal Fluid, gotcha.

177
00:32:48.663 --> 00:32:51.632 line:15% 
So you're wired very differently.

178
00:33:14.417 --> 00:33:16.055 line:15% 
Again, which gland?

179
00:33:16.864 --> 00:33:18.654 line:15% 
The master gland.

180
00:33:18.654 --> 00:33:20.064 line:15% 
The pituitary.

181
00:33:20.064 --> 00:33:22.565
It allows you to be able to run through

182
00:33:22.565 --> 00:33:24.251
this massive amount of energy,

183
00:33:24.251 --> 00:33:27.678
which is intensely focused through your mind.

184
00:34:20.603 --> 00:34:23.400 line:15% 
They said it could be a placebo effect, right?

185
00:34:36.285 --> 00:34:37.584 line:15% 
Very true.

186
00:35:42.566 --> 00:35:43.979 line:15% 
I've seen the pictures.

187
00:35:43.979 --> 00:35:46.826
I've seen the papers from the university because they have

188
00:35:46.826 --> 00:35:50.134
whole departments studying the lands that you've worked on.

189
00:35:50.134 --> 00:35:52.760
And astounding.
<v ->I'm talking.</v>

190
00:36:08.902 --> 00:36:10.437 line:15% 
<v ->Cashew.</v>

191
00:36:19.908 --> 00:36:20.989 line:15% 
They are what?

192
00:36:21.415 --> 00:36:22.995 line:15% 
Oh, miraculous, yes.

193
00:36:32.804 --> 00:36:35.666 line:15% 
The leaves were very clean and healthy.

194
00:36:52.773 --> 00:36:54.974
So that these healthy plants and trees

195
00:36:54.974 --> 00:36:57.032
were transmitting the energy to them!

196
00:36:57.032 --> 00:36:58.607
<v ->Yes.
<v ->Beautiful.</v>

197
00:38:53.563 --> 00:38:55.068 line:15% 
They said that, in the first moments,

198
00:38:55.068 --> 00:38:57.315 line:15% 
"This is the biggest miracle on the planet."

199
00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:07.790 line:15% 
It's like a perfected human.

200
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:10.502 line:15% 
And they were perfected trees.
<v ->Yes, trees.</v>

201
00:39:10.502 --> 00:39:12.362
<v ->Absolutely perfect.</v>

202
00:39:22.668 --> 00:39:24.943 line:15% 
Chlorophyll A and B?
<v ->Yes.</v>

203
00:40:00.555 --> 00:40:02.165 line:15% 
<v ->You'll no yield.</v>

204
00:41:07.043 --> 00:41:09.837 line:15% 
80 varieties and also seeds.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

205
00:41:25.978 --> 00:41:29.262
<v ->They're glorious-looking as I've seen in the pictures.</v>

206
00:41:29.262 --> 00:41:30.694 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, very different.</v>

207
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:04.065 line:15% 
<v ->No placebo effect there.</v>

208
00:42:05.718 --> 00:42:07.316 line:15% 
No nonsense.

209
00:42:30.756 --> 00:42:32.220 line:15% 
What is the what life?

210
00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.467 line:15% 
The shelf life of the cashew?
<v ->Yeah.</v>

211
00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.565 line:15% 
<v ->Whoa.</v>

212
00:42:49.006 --> 00:42:51.881 line:15% 
Normally they go rancid rather quickly.

213
00:43:06.128 --> 00:43:08.266 line:15% 
Bio-photo emissions, ok.

214
00:43:24.271 --> 00:43:25.615 line:15% 
This is wonderful.

215
00:43:25.615 --> 00:43:26.750 line:15% 
It's not just cashews.

216
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:30.215 line:15% 
You've done many crops that you've taken already flowering.

217
00:43:30.215 --> 00:43:32.576 line:15% 
That was interesting to me, the mango.

218
00:44:19.576 --> 00:44:20.864 line:15% 
Spongy.

219
00:46:27.114 --> 00:46:28.752 line:15% 
Like a diet mango!

220
00:46:28.752 --> 00:46:30.814
Let's talk about what your intention is?

221
00:46:30.814 --> 00:46:35.330
What is your greater intention to do with this kind of work?

222
00:46:48.739 --> 00:46:50.840 line:15% 
They're hitting the final wall, yes.

223
00:47:56.577 --> 00:47:57.440 line:15% 
Absolutely.

224
00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.076 line:15% 
All kinds of toxins.

225
00:48:21.797 --> 00:48:23.159 line:15% 
And you do.

226
00:48:51.256 --> 00:48:52.397 line:15% 
Can you say his name again?

227
00:48:52.397 --> 00:48:54.311 line:15% 
Dr. who at Penn State?

228
00:49:18.912 --> 00:49:20.570 line:15% 
Radioactive water, yes.

229
00:49:35.928 --> 00:49:37.527 line:15% 
You reduced the amount of radiation

230
00:49:37.527 --> 00:49:39.229 line:15% 
in the water through intention.

231
00:49:39.229 --> 00:49:41.057 line:15% 
<v ->Yes, definitely.</v>

232
00:50:09.485 --> 00:50:11.412
<v ->So many problems with toxicities</v>

233
00:50:11.412 --> 00:50:14.546
in the water, in the air, in the food, everything.

234
00:50:15.147 --> 00:50:17.238
Through your foundation, you're saying,

235
00:50:17.238 --> 00:50:19.490
from what I understand, you're saying, you're looking

236
00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:24.069
also for the requests and the desire

237
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:27.439
of the visionaries of this country to call on you to

238
00:50:27.439 --> 00:50:31.515
utilize your energies to start help healing larger systems.

239
00:50:31.515 --> 00:50:33.226
<v ->Yes, definitely.</v>

240
00:51:16.875 --> 00:51:20.352 line:15% 
<v ->You have some very prominent people now that you're</v>

241
00:51:20.352 --> 00:51:23.621
working alongside, including Deepak Chopra and others.

242
00:51:24.758 --> 00:51:27.626
Many, many people are going to hearing about you over time.

243
00:51:27.626 --> 00:51:29.496
We have all of your contact information

244
00:51:29.496 --> 00:51:32.163
for your foundation here.

245
00:51:32.163 --> 00:51:34.315
We're going to be giving that.

246
00:51:35.244 --> 00:51:38.011
In addition, if somebody wants to see you,

247
00:51:38.011 --> 00:51:39.432
you appear in various places

248
00:51:39.432 --> 00:51:41.162
in California, Arizona.
<v ->Yes, everywhere.</v>

249
00:51:41.162 --> 00:51:42.655
People can come, and they can come

250
00:51:42.655 --> 00:51:44.254
to one of your group sessions.

251
00:51:44.254 --> 00:51:48.955
You do a group transmission of these boosted energy fields,

252
00:51:48.955 --> 00:51:51.424
which is very powerful and beautiful.

253
00:51:51.424 --> 00:51:53.097
People can come find you, if they wish.

254
00:51:53.097 --> 00:51:54.321
It's a "by a donation only."

255
00:51:54.321 --> 00:51:57.588
It's not like it costs an arm and a leg for them to do that.

256
00:51:59.353 --> 00:52:02.131
All I can say is I'm very happy that

257
00:52:02.131 --> 00:52:03.826
we had a chance to meet.

258
00:52:03.826 --> 00:52:06.252
I'm very happy that you're doing the work you're doing.

259
00:52:06.252 --> 00:52:10.748
And I do hope that science can ultimately understand it,

260
00:52:10.748 --> 00:52:14.978
to the extent that we do develop inroads

261
00:52:14.978 --> 00:52:17.339
into what is going to be the future sciences, and understand

262
00:52:17.339 --> 00:52:19.861
and understanding how this energy

263
00:52:19.861 --> 00:52:22.644
can be channeled for the healing of everything.

264
00:52:22.644 --> 00:52:25.637
Every person, every living thing on the planet.

265
00:52:25.637 --> 00:52:26.774
<v ->Yes.</v>

266
00:52:26.774 --> 00:52:28.905 line:15% 
Is that kinda what you're trying to do?

267
00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:02.193 line:15% 
They don't have to harm us then.

268
00:53:02.193 --> 00:53:03.933 line:15% 
And you have worked with this.

269
00:53:37.808 --> 00:53:40.128
You're here now, not in the future.

270
00:53:40.128 --> 00:53:43.655
Thank you so much for spending the time with us today.

271
00:53:43.655 --> 00:53:46.187
<v ->Thank you very much.</v>

272
00:53:46.187 --> 00:53:47.022
Ok, bye.

273
00:53:48.421 --> 00:53:50.851
<v ->You can find out more about Mr. Trivedi's ongoing work</v>

274
00:53:50.851 --> 00:53:52.525
at the Trivedi Foundation.

275
00:53:52.525 --> 00:53:54.850
He's committed to using his energy to create

276
00:53:54.850 --> 00:53:57.724
abundant healthy crops, to feed the planet

277
00:53:57.724 --> 00:54:00.166
as well as cleaning up the world's water supplies,

278
00:54:00.166 --> 00:54:01.760
so all people can have access

279
00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.968
to clean, healthy drinking water.

280
00:54:03.968 --> 00:54:04.932
To connect with his work,

281
00:54:04.932 --> 00:54:07.647
you can go to trivedifoundation.org.

282
00:54:07.647 --> 00:54:10.812
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
