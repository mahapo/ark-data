00:00:00.568 --> 00:00:02.868
﻿- Sonia Barett awaken the hard way

2
00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:05.388
by herself broke and with no help.

3
00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:07.367
Still, this fascinating woman managed

4
00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:10.368
to open her perception to begin unraveling

5
00:00:10.368 --> 00:00:12.047
some of the greatest misperceptions

6
00:00:12.047 --> 00:00:13.547
of human experience.

7
00:00:13.547 --> 00:00:14.707
In this conversation,

8
00:00:14.707 --> 00:00:17.148
we speak about how we create our reality,

9
00:00:17.148 --> 00:00:19.868
extend our time on earth and much more.

10
00:00:19.868 --> 00:00:23.138
It's a fascinating ride into the nature of perception.

11
00:00:33.107 --> 00:00:35.145
Sonia, what catapulted you on to this path of

12
00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:38.785
looking at the holographic nature of reality?

13
00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:39.854
<v ->Well,</v>

14
00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:42.483
an interesting question always

15
00:00:42.483 --> 00:00:45.564
no matter how many times I do get asked this question

16
00:00:45.564 --> 00:00:48.508
and the reason is life.

17
00:00:49.752 --> 00:00:54.538
I went through some very intense circumstances

18
00:00:54.538 --> 00:00:56.038
in getting divorced.

19
00:00:56.038 --> 00:00:57.945
And at that point,

20
00:00:59.335 --> 00:01:02.475
my curiosity is to why I was blamed here,

21
00:01:02.475 --> 00:01:05.479
why did I go through what I went through for 14 years.

22
00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.280
And along with always being curious,

23
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.140
I've always been curious, I mean, since I was a child.

24
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.620
But the stage in my life would come

25
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.020
where it was time to really dig deeper.

26
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.917
The difference with me and my discoveries is that

27
00:01:20.917 --> 00:01:25.277
I did not want the information to come from anyone.

28
00:01:25.277 --> 00:01:27.537
I didn't wanna hear it from anybody.

29
00:01:27.537 --> 00:01:29.096
I didn't even know there were people out there

30
00:01:29.096 --> 00:01:29.996
doing workshops.

31
00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:33.436
I didn't know anybody believed or thought the way I did.

32
00:01:33.436 --> 00:01:38.284
And so not wanting to look at books,

33
00:01:39.455 --> 00:01:41.594
I knew that there was a way.

34
00:01:41.594 --> 00:01:46.309
I knew there was a way to pierce some sort of veil,

35
00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:50.250
to understand more about the nature of reality.

36
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.396
And that's really in a nutshell what happened to me.

37
00:01:54.646 --> 00:01:57.786
I have no idea how to meditate.

38
00:01:57.786 --> 00:01:59.286
No knowledge of meditation.

39
00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.667
I'm coming from a church, a religious,

40
00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:03.186
well, Christian background

41
00:02:03.186 --> 00:02:05.227
and it's all about prayer.

42
00:02:05.227 --> 00:02:06.686
So you're praying.

43
00:02:06.686 --> 00:02:09.826
So in terms of doing meditation, what was that?

44
00:02:09.826 --> 00:02:12.966
But something in me kept saying

45
00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.567
there is a way.

46
00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:19.567
So I would sit diligently and attempt to sit,

47
00:02:19.826 --> 00:02:23.686
you know, in my yoga style position

48
00:02:23.686 --> 00:02:27.587
and continuously try to

49
00:02:27.587 --> 00:02:30.506
focus at engaging the breath.

50
00:02:30.506 --> 00:02:33.387
Not even knowing anything about the breath.

51
00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:35.187
Over time I'd say,

52
00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:36.466
I don't know, it could have been moths,

53
00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:38.606
it could have been, I don't know how long at this point

54
00:02:38.606 --> 00:02:40.423
'cause it was a while ago.

55
00:02:40.423 --> 00:02:41.903
One day,

56
00:02:41.903 --> 00:02:46.903
after doing this so much,

57
00:02:46.963 --> 00:02:49.732
I pierce this veil.

58
00:02:50.922 --> 00:02:53.941
My hand started moving

59
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:55.241
at the breath,

60
00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:58.062
I caught, it's almost like I caught a wave.

61
00:02:58.062 --> 00:03:03.062
And that breath just opened my whole being up

62
00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.668
and my whole body was vibrating

63
00:03:08.668 --> 00:03:10.678
as I've never felt anything before.

64
00:03:10.678 --> 00:03:12.258
I mean, now I understand

65
00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:14.659
scientifically understand a lot more of what happened.

66
00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.118
So at that time, it was mystical

67
00:03:17.118 --> 00:03:19.549
but then over time, the mysticism went away.

68
00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.736
I started to understand things more in a scientific level.

69
00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:26.615
And so, anyway, so that made me realize,

70
00:03:26.615 --> 00:03:27.716
oh, my gosh.

71
00:03:27.716 --> 00:03:30.115
I'm in this space, I'm seeing

72
00:03:30.115 --> 00:03:32.856
I'm very conscious of the reality around me

73
00:03:32.856 --> 00:03:34.916
so it's not as if I suddenly,

74
00:03:34.916 --> 00:03:36.075
I'm not conscious anymore.

75
00:03:36.075 --> 00:03:36.895
I'm conscious of that

76
00:03:36.895 --> 00:03:39.915
but I'm conscious a reality outside now

77
00:03:39.915 --> 00:03:44.915
or beyond what I termed, this matrix or this system

78
00:03:45.896 --> 00:03:48.175
within which we operate.

79
00:03:48.175 --> 00:03:50.531
And so that was my beginning.

80
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:55.531
And it was the intensity of the marriage and that life

81
00:03:55.731 --> 00:04:00.652
and now being a single mother with two sons

82
00:04:00.652 --> 00:04:04.312
that really propelled me into discovering

83
00:04:04.312 --> 00:04:07.651
without the aid of anybody else.

84
00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:10.512
And now the power for me is being able to

85
00:04:10.512 --> 00:04:14.071
say to other people that it is very possible

86
00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:15.772
for us to understand

87
00:04:15.772 --> 00:04:17.952
'cause we are made up of information.

88
00:04:17.952 --> 00:04:19.762
<v Voiceover>So the pain of everyday life</v>

89
00:04:19.762 --> 00:04:21.829
is what took you on to the journey

90
00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.249
to want to know the deeper elements of yourself,

91
00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:26.829
the why for and the where for.

92
00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:27.629
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

93
00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:28.429
<v Voiceover>So on your own</v>

94
00:04:28.429 --> 00:04:31.069
you pierced through the veil as you say.

95
00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.670
And let's talk about what you saw on the other side

96
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.310
'cause that's where things start getting juicy.

97
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.450
<v ->Well, for me, gosh, it was so long ago.</v>

98
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.431
For me, what I remember,

99
00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:45.308
what I remember is that what I saw

100
00:04:45.308 --> 00:04:48.489
and maybe, I don't know if it's more so felt,

101
00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:52.939
it was a complete union with creation.

102
00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.679
I did see, it was like the cosmos

103
00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:57.435
It was everything.

104
00:04:57.435 --> 00:05:02.435
But there was a sense of really being part of

105
00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:05.735
and it was nothing separate for me.

106
00:05:05.735 --> 00:05:07.675
So for me it was more that sense

107
00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:11.303
and I realized I was really sort of traveling.

108
00:05:13.073 --> 00:05:15.433
I can't say that I met anybody

109
00:05:15.433 --> 00:05:17.773
or any other being or anything like that,

110
00:05:17.773 --> 00:05:22.613
but it was that sense that this is what lies beyond

111
00:05:22.613 --> 00:05:27.373
what you see as your waking everyday life.

112
00:05:27.373 --> 00:05:29.573
And so for me, that was it.

113
00:05:29.573 --> 00:05:34.421
And at that point, I started to be able to,

114
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:37.931
when I say access information

115
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:39.671
it's a little bit different because I don't,

116
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:41.191
it wasn't channeling.

117
00:05:41.191 --> 00:05:42.531
I wasn't channeling anyone.

118
00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:47.219
I was what I would probably refer to as

119
00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:48.979
just a pure connection

120
00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.019
because you know, we are all transmitters and receivers.

121
00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:54.779
And so I allowed myself

122
00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:59.467
to be introduced then let say to myself

123
00:06:00.657 --> 00:06:02.237
in a bigger picture.

124
00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:06.777
And I started to write over a period of time

125
00:06:06.777 --> 00:06:08.517
information that I was getting

126
00:06:08.517 --> 00:06:11.197
and a lot of it was on scientific things

127
00:06:11.197 --> 00:06:13.236
'cause I'd never taken physics before.

128
00:06:13.236 --> 00:06:14.617
So this was all very,

129
00:06:14.617 --> 00:06:15.629
I was like a child in the candy store.

130
00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:16.986
<v Voiceover>Yeah, and this is drawing you</v>

131
00:06:16.986 --> 00:06:18.184
into the world of quantum physics.

132
00:06:18.184 --> 00:06:19.063
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

133
00:06:19.063 --> 00:06:20.960
I didn't even know the word quantum physics.

134
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.180
I didn’t even know that word existed.

135
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.500
That's what was so funny.

136
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.360
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

137
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.940
<v ->Yeah.</v>

138
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.280
<v Voiceover>So as you started exploring</v>

139
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.740
and then writing about your discoveries,

140
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.000
one of the things I like that you've written about,

141
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.640
I read an article of yours recently.

142
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.801
It said, thoughts act as a portal

143
00:06:38.801 --> 00:06:41.680
essentially to the past, the present, and the future

144
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.649
whether you turn that future

145
00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:44.488
life's future timelines and so forth.

146
00:06:44.488 --> 00:06:46.029
This is multiple realities.

147
00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:47.629
Why don't you go ahead and launch on into that

148
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:50.669
because I think a lot of people find this interesting.

149
00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:51.748
<v ->In terms of thought,</v>

150
00:06:51.748 --> 00:06:53.868
well, my feeling is that every thought

151
00:06:53.868 --> 00:06:56.028
is definitely taking you on a journey.

152
00:06:56.028 --> 00:06:57.665
We're all time travelers.

153
00:06:57.665 --> 00:07:00.065
And I think it's understanding

154
00:07:00.065 --> 00:07:04.399
the concept of time as well but thought,

155
00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:09.340
thought and choice and those things are what

156
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.460
those two things are determining

157
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.360
what the next moment is going to be.

158
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.360
Your choice is obviously going to be based on

159
00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:21.739
where you are in your consciousness.

160
00:07:21.739 --> 00:07:25.340
And consciousness is for me, I define it as awareness.

161
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.140
It's self-awareness.

162
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.759
Being aware,

163
00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:31.279
but there are different levels of that awareness.

164
00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:35.026
So obviously thoughts, your thoughts are going to

165
00:07:36.596 --> 00:07:39.196
be based on your level of awareness

166
00:07:39.196 --> 00:07:40.514
which of course then is gonna be

167
00:07:40.514 --> 00:07:41.993
all tied into your perceptions.

168
00:07:41.993 --> 00:07:44.433
So all of these things come together

169
00:07:44.433 --> 00:07:46.893
in terms of where your thought process is going to be

170
00:07:46.893 --> 00:07:49.973
and of course, with the thought process comes

171
00:07:49.973 --> 00:07:51.233
the choices that we make.

172
00:07:51.233 --> 00:07:52.273
The choices that we make

173
00:07:52.273 --> 00:07:54.114
are gonna be based on the perception.

174
00:07:54.114 --> 00:07:56.613
It's gonna be based on your level of consciousness

175
00:07:56.613 --> 00:07:58.813
which is self-awareness

176
00:07:58.813 --> 00:08:00.774
which is then going to be

177
00:08:00.774 --> 00:08:03.693
where that thought process is generated from.

178
00:08:03.693 --> 00:08:06.194
So it's like, "Which comes first, the chicken or the egg?"

179
00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:07.853
kind of thing.

180
00:08:07.853 --> 00:08:10.450
And then, every choice at that point

181
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.670
is taking you on a journey.

182
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.010
Door number one, door number two.

183
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.704
Because all that exists are potentials

184
00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:18.204
and you know, all that exist are possibilities.

185
00:08:18.204 --> 00:08:23.204
So every choice is taking you on a different journey.

186
00:08:23.244 --> 00:08:26.344
Now, that's the reason why it becomes so significant

187
00:08:26.344 --> 00:08:31.344
in terms of what we understand that creation to be

188
00:08:31.904 --> 00:08:35.424
and how much we are expanding our awareness,

189
00:08:35.424 --> 00:08:37.364
our consciousness.

190
00:08:37.364 --> 00:08:40.304
The more limited we are in the expansion

191
00:08:40.304 --> 00:08:42.884
of our consciousness, of our awareness

192
00:08:42.884 --> 00:08:46.644
is the more limited we're gonna be in our perception

193
00:08:46.644 --> 00:08:47.904
hence our thoughts,

194
00:08:47.904 --> 00:08:49.864
hence the choices that we make,

195
00:08:49.864 --> 00:08:53.304
hence what we can actually experience.

196
00:08:53.304 --> 00:08:56.904
So thought then, yes, becomes a major,

197
00:08:56.904 --> 00:09:00.664
plays a major role because the thoughts,

198
00:09:00.664 --> 00:09:02.118
thoughts levitate above our heads.

199
00:09:02.118 --> 00:09:04.238
I mean, it's all frequency patterns.

200
00:09:04.238 --> 00:09:06.958
It's all like radio waves.

201
00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.518
And it levitates above your head.

202
00:09:10.518 --> 00:09:14.398
And it comes in through the top of the head

203
00:09:14.398 --> 00:09:17.075
and through the ventricles,

204
00:09:17.075 --> 00:09:21.955
in the brain through the spinal fluid

205
00:09:21.955 --> 00:09:23.376
and it bathes the cells.

206
00:09:23.376 --> 00:09:24.935
The fluid bathes the cells.

207
00:09:24.935 --> 00:09:27.895
So your thoughts are bathing your entire body.

208
00:09:27.895 --> 00:09:31.275
Every cell in your body is being bathed by those thoughts

209
00:09:31.275 --> 00:09:34.335
and it's taking instructions obviously on

210
00:09:34.335 --> 00:09:35.433
what it's gonna be,

211
00:09:35.433 --> 00:09:38.512
all of those things based on those thoughts

212
00:09:38.512 --> 00:09:39.513
and of course, again,

213
00:09:39.513 --> 00:09:41.212
choice again, comes into play

214
00:09:41.212 --> 00:09:44.692
and your travel through time.

215
00:09:44.692 --> 00:09:46.153
<v Voiceover>And so let's talk about that part,</v>

216
00:09:46.153 --> 00:09:48.339
the travel for time, how does this

217
00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:55.169
overlay with the concept of time or the time loop

218
00:09:55.169 --> 00:09:57.489
past, present and future?

219
00:09:57.489 --> 00:10:00.329
<v ->Past, present and future, it's</v>

220
00:10:00.329 --> 00:10:02.289
such an interesting,

221
00:10:02.289 --> 00:10:05.809
interesting subject in terms of what I discovered.

222
00:10:05.809 --> 00:10:08.209
What I discovered in the sense of,

223
00:10:08.209 --> 00:10:10.890
I'm gonna touch on this aspect of it,

224
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.787
in the sense of when people talk about past lives.

225
00:10:13.787 --> 00:10:15.254
What I discovered was that

226
00:10:15.254 --> 00:10:19.174
we were living all of these at the same time.

227
00:10:19.174 --> 00:10:24.174
And it was only based on what we were conscious of,

228
00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:27.674
the experience that we're conscious of at that moment,

229
00:10:27.674 --> 00:10:28.934
at this moment.

230
00:10:28.934 --> 00:10:30.614
And because of that it seems like

231
00:10:30.614 --> 00:10:32.714
it is the only one that exists.

232
00:10:32.714 --> 00:10:37.714
Yet, we are actually experiencing

233
00:10:37.994 --> 00:10:39.981
many different pockets of time.

234
00:10:41.531 --> 00:10:45.511
And so when you have someone that just say,

235
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:47.911
hypnosis, there on the hypnosis

236
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:51.751
and they go back in what we call time

237
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.191
it becomes very real to them.

238
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:55.551
For them it is a very real experience.

239
00:10:55.551 --> 00:10:57.531
Now, how do we know

240
00:10:57.531 --> 00:11:01.731
that the people that they're meeting in this memory,

241
00:11:01.731 --> 00:11:04.731
in this supposed going back in time,

242
00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:08.291
how do we know that those people in that pocket of time

243
00:11:08.291 --> 00:11:09.471
isn't really seeing them

244
00:11:09.471 --> 00:11:12.645
and that experience is not actually occurring

245
00:11:12.645 --> 00:11:15.042
again for them even though you're seeing them

246
00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:17.302
sitting there still in the physical body.

247
00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:21.522
So the whole concept of past, present, and future

248
00:11:21.522 --> 00:11:24.022
becomes a real interesting one.

249
00:11:24.022 --> 00:11:27.582
In a lecture that I did earlier today,

250
00:11:27.582 --> 00:11:32.502
I was talking about the footprints that were found

251
00:11:32.502 --> 00:11:35.262
of humans 1.3 million years ago

252
00:11:35.262 --> 00:11:36.739
which says that there were human beings

253
00:11:36.739 --> 00:11:38.679
who looked exactly, you know,

254
00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:40.679
chances are exactly like us.

255
00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:44.620
So my question was, how do you know

256
00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.199
that 1.3 million years ago or three million years ago

257
00:11:48.199 --> 00:11:49.579
wasn't really the future

258
00:11:49.579 --> 00:11:52.431
from which this reality spun off from.

259
00:11:52.431 --> 00:11:55.890
It can get very trippy in the sense of what we

260
00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:58.211
allow ourselves to see and to understand

261
00:11:58.211 --> 00:11:59.451
with the nature of time,

262
00:11:59.451 --> 00:12:02.690
how do we know that that footprint was

263
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.110
really probably never there before

264
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.090
but somehow it now shows up

265
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.711
in this particular pocket of time.

266
00:12:10.711 --> 00:12:14.471
Now, I also looked at the fact that

267
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:17.830
archaeologists, the discoveries that are made,

268
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.171
even though they may have visited that area 50 times,

269
00:12:21.171 --> 00:12:22.610
they don't see anything.

270
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.411
One day, another archaeologist goes

271
00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:28.051
and suddenly it's that right moment

272
00:12:28.051 --> 00:12:29.271
to suddenly discover,

273
00:12:29.271 --> 00:12:31.670
"Look at what we found, a hidden city."

274
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.891
Was it always there?

275
00:12:33.891 --> 00:12:38.891
Or is there something that says,

276
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:44.351
it's either time to insert this piece or to cross

277
00:12:44.351 --> 00:12:46.671
timeliness to some degree

278
00:12:46.671 --> 00:12:48.491
so that this shows up,

279
00:12:48.491 --> 00:12:52.491
whatever shows up, at a particular point now

280
00:12:52.491 --> 00:12:55.250
for a particular progression.

281
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.051
So there is so much trippiness to this.

282
00:12:58.051 --> 00:13:01.891
And even in terms of if we look at

283
00:13:01.891 --> 00:13:04.252
what we might consider to be then the future,

284
00:13:04.252 --> 00:13:06.192
a future timelime,

285
00:13:06.192 --> 00:13:09.012
we don't know that this timeline that we're in,

286
00:13:09.012 --> 00:13:10.292
obviously this timeline that we're in,

287
00:13:10.292 --> 00:13:11.792
I view it as the past.

288
00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:13.232
Like a burnt out star,

289
00:13:13.232 --> 00:13:15.032
this has already happened.

290
00:13:15.032 --> 00:13:16.792
So we are in the past

291
00:13:16.792 --> 00:13:19.572
but if there is such a thing as the future

292
00:13:19.572 --> 00:13:22.252
with a more evolved level of technology,

293
00:13:22.252 --> 00:13:24.592
how do we know that in that future,

294
00:13:24.592 --> 00:13:27.912
we did not use that level of technology?

295
00:13:27.912 --> 00:13:31.572
And we are really the pre-historic version,

296
00:13:31.572 --> 00:13:36.092
we are now in that space evolving back to

297
00:13:36.092 --> 00:13:38.092
that particular point in time

298
00:13:38.092 --> 00:13:40.392
of this highly advance technology?

299
00:13:40.392 --> 00:13:42.352
There's so much going on.

300
00:13:42.352 --> 00:13:43.112
<v Voiceover>Yes,</v>

301
00:13:43.112 --> 00:13:46.693
there is emerging evidences that were for,

302
00:13:46.693 --> 00:13:48.713
or at least theory

303
00:13:48.713 --> 00:13:51.533
for the notion that we have time

304
00:13:51.533 --> 00:13:54.553
and we have a reverse time or negative time

305
00:13:54.553 --> 00:13:56.093
in which we're constantly moving

306
00:13:56.093 --> 00:13:59.293
towards the experience in the center, whatever that may be.

307
00:13:59.293 --> 00:14:02.074
And so, again, you're talking about how is it happened

308
00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:04.575
or where are we in the past or the future.

309
00:14:04.575 --> 00:14:06.695
And so, this could stand to the notion

310
00:14:06.695 --> 00:14:11.035
of not just multiple realities but also multi dimensions.

311
00:14:11.035 --> 00:14:13.975
Within which dimensions might we be functioning

312
00:14:13.975 --> 00:14:15.575
on these different levels?

313
00:14:15.575 --> 00:14:18.275
And how do you find that to be,

314
00:14:18.275 --> 00:14:22.755
say, for the journey the person is on right now,

315
00:14:22.755 --> 00:14:25.340
where do you find the relevance of these to them?

316
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.557
<v ->More than anything else, I think that</v>

317
00:14:30.888 --> 00:14:35.467
if an individual really desires to know

318
00:14:35.467 --> 00:14:38.547
and to understand more about who they are,

319
00:14:38.547 --> 00:14:40.616
really feel as if they’ve got a little

320
00:14:40.616 --> 00:14:45.585
more of an idea as to creation,

321
00:14:45.585 --> 00:14:50.585
we must be willing to be expansive in our thinking.

322
00:14:52.014 --> 00:14:54.454
For such a long time,

323
00:14:54.454 --> 00:14:57.854
we've been used to being

324
00:14:57.854 --> 00:14:59.394
programmed to beings.

325
00:14:59.394 --> 00:15:00.694
Very programmed.

326
00:15:00.694 --> 00:15:03.994
So we're used to some sort of package

327
00:15:03.994 --> 00:15:06.994
you know, by which we operate.

328
00:15:06.994 --> 00:15:10.014
In order to really allow

329
00:15:10.014 --> 00:15:11.574
the possibilities of creation

330
00:15:11.574 --> 00:15:14.513
or creation to open up to an individual

331
00:15:14.513 --> 00:15:15.874
so that they can understand more

332
00:15:15.874 --> 00:15:17.934
their perception has to widen.

333
00:15:17.934 --> 00:15:20.554
So I'm saying all of these to say,

334
00:15:20.554 --> 00:15:22.614
you must widen your perception.

335
00:15:22.614 --> 00:15:24.052
You must take the lid off.

336
00:15:24.052 --> 00:15:27.360
You must allow the possibilities.

337
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:32.130
We want to keep it in a comfortable space for ourselves,

338
00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.750
we want this to remain in a space where we go,

339
00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:37.350
okay, well, this is as much as I will believe

340
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.330
but I won't go pass this point.

341
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:41.970
And if you do that,

342
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.690
you will limit yourself.

343
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.330
It can not unfold to you

344
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.630
unless you are that open to allow the process

345
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:53.370
because let's face it,

346
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.410
everything is responding

347
00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:57.378
according to your interaction with it.

348
00:15:58.468 --> 00:16:01.028
Everything is responding based on that.

349
00:16:01.028 --> 00:16:05.006
So, if you are not responding

350
00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:09.126
to anything beyond the package that you've lived,

351
00:16:09.126 --> 00:16:12.486
you're only gonna see that much and that far--

352
00:16:12.486 --> 00:16:14.580
<v Voiceover>And this gets into intrinsic fears of people</v>

353
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.338
because their self-identity is wrapped up

354
00:16:16.338 --> 00:16:18.198
in this perception and beliefs.

355
00:16:18.198 --> 00:16:20.118
<v ->Absolutely, and your self-identity is a package.</v>

356
00:16:20.118 --> 00:16:21.968
<v Voiceover>It's a package in we know from</v>

357
00:16:21.968 --> 00:16:24.465
work of many people who slipped in

358
00:16:24.465 --> 00:16:25.638
certainly one of them

359
00:16:25.638 --> 00:16:27.978
that what we are experiencing is about

360
00:16:27.978 --> 00:16:30.276
3% of the reality of what we're experiencing.

361
00:16:30.276 --> 00:16:32.956
What we perceive is only about 3% of the reality.

362
00:16:32.956 --> 00:16:35.616
<v ->Yeah, if even that, because it's so,</v>

363
00:16:35.616 --> 00:16:38.096
you can't even put a number on it.

364
00:16:38.096 --> 00:16:43.096
If we live or we exist in an unlimited,

365
00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:49.262
unlimited possibilities, if that's all that exist then

366
00:16:50.652 --> 00:16:51.912
there is no number.

367
00:16:51.912 --> 00:16:55.712
It's immeasurable as to what we are experiencing right now.

368
00:16:55.712 --> 00:16:57.812
And I think for me, that was the excitement

369
00:16:57.812 --> 00:17:01.070
in realizing that I have not scratched the surface.

370
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.550
Will I ever scratch the surface?

371
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:03.650
Because it's so big.

372
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.510
There is no ultimate

373
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:09.430
and I think that's another illusion that people have,

374
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.149
that they are going to get to this place.

375
00:17:12.149 --> 00:17:15.090
And there is no getting to this place.

376
00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:19.510
There is this continuous expansion of one's consciousness,

377
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.490
an expansion of your interaction with creation itself

378
00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:28.490
which is continuing this expansion of creations,

379
00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:30.410
things that you can create,

380
00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.190
I don't know, maybe you might create a universe,

381
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.889
I don't know.

382
00:17:33.889 --> 00:17:36.749
But there is so much to be created

383
00:17:36.749 --> 00:17:38.990
and there is so much that we are already doing.

384
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.058
We created this experience here.

385
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.551
We are source.

386
00:17:43.551 --> 00:17:45.411
We are what we are looking for.

387
00:17:45.411 --> 00:17:49.731
So I think that one who is new on this path

388
00:17:49.731 --> 00:17:54.731
has to realize, "Look, I've gotta be able to recognize,

389
00:17:55.131 --> 00:17:56.971
"I'm filled with programs."

390
00:17:56.971 --> 00:17:58.051
Not a problem.

391
00:17:58.051 --> 00:17:58.711
Not a problem.

392
00:17:58.711 --> 00:18:00.971
Because no matter what we do, it's programming.

393
00:18:00.971 --> 00:18:02.931
No matter what we do is programming.

394
00:18:02.931 --> 00:18:06.031
The trick to this is evolving those programs.

395
00:18:06.031 --> 00:18:09.311
It's not to go, "Oh, my God, I can't, no."

396
00:18:09.311 --> 00:18:11.511
Every single one of those programs

397
00:18:11.511 --> 00:18:13.211
have lead every one of us

398
00:18:13.211 --> 00:18:15.551
to the moment, to this moment.

399
00:18:15.551 --> 00:18:18.851
So it's not just discarding and disqualifying them

400
00:18:18.851 --> 00:18:20.591
because you disqualify the experiences

401
00:18:20.591 --> 00:18:22.411
that you did receive from them

402
00:18:22.411 --> 00:18:24.931
which is what brought you to this very moment.

403
00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:28.831
But it's all about evolving what we,

404
00:18:28.831 --> 00:18:31.471
what we have come to understand

405
00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:34.051
because everything we do becomes a ritual.

406
00:18:34.051 --> 00:18:35.831
So you must evolve the rituals.

407
00:18:35.831 --> 00:18:37.131
It's just the way we're designed.

408
00:18:37.131 --> 00:18:41.591
These physical bodies which I define as a vehicle

409
00:18:41.591 --> 00:18:42.891
which I think is very important

410
00:18:42.891 --> 00:18:45.191
that we make that distinction

411
00:18:45.191 --> 00:18:48.591
that they are vehicles with in which we

412
00:18:48.591 --> 00:18:49.671
are operating.

413
00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:52.111
You know, the genie's lamp.

414
00:18:52.111 --> 00:18:53.751
As I say, we are the genie

415
00:18:53.751 --> 00:18:57.491
that the spirit inside of these vessels.

416
00:18:57.491 --> 00:19:00.791
So I think that's very, very important for us to

417
00:19:00.791 --> 00:19:03.331
begin to realize those things

418
00:19:03.331 --> 00:19:06.091
in order to really begin to shift the veil

419
00:19:06.091 --> 00:19:09.091
and work transcending those fears.

420
00:19:09.091 --> 00:19:12.331
There's really nothing to fear

421
00:19:12.331 --> 00:19:14.091
'cause you're looking for yourself.

422
00:19:14.091 --> 00:19:15.052
<v Voiceover>We're looking for ourselves</v>

423
00:19:15.052 --> 00:19:17.412
but we have to pierce through all of our fears

424
00:19:17.412 --> 00:19:19.392
in order to be able do that.

425
00:19:19.392 --> 00:19:22.512
And you bring up a number of different common fears

426
00:19:22.512 --> 00:19:25.333
that people have when they think, "Oh, no,

427
00:19:25.333 --> 00:19:27.273
"I don't really buy into any of that.

428
00:19:27.273 --> 00:19:29.237
"I don't think I'd become open minded.

429
00:19:29.237 --> 00:19:30.597
"I don't think I'm running in any programs."

430
00:19:30.597 --> 00:19:33.378
And then you talk about simple things like

431
00:19:33.378 --> 00:19:34.738
the insurance industry.

432
00:19:34.738 --> 00:19:36.959
<v ->Oh, that's a big one of mine, yes.</v>

433
00:19:36.959 --> 00:19:37.899
<v Voiceover>Yeah, I like that one.</v>

434
00:19:37.899 --> 00:19:39.062
Because that's when where a lot of people

435
00:19:39.062 --> 00:19:40.582
get really hung up.

436
00:19:40.582 --> 00:19:42.022
<v ->Oh yeah, you have to have that.</v>

437
00:19:42.022 --> 00:19:42.842
And who says it?

438
00:19:42.842 --> 00:19:44.222
<v Voiceover>It's like, what's insurance is about?</v>

439
00:19:44.222 --> 00:19:45.622
So let's talk about on the spirit level.

440
00:19:45.622 --> 00:19:48.642
What's going on with the notion of insurance?

441
00:19:48.642 --> 00:19:50.402
<v ->Well, we're ensuring everything.</v>

442
00:19:50.402 --> 00:19:53.142
We're ensuring that we will get sick.

443
00:19:53.142 --> 00:19:55.662
We are ensuring that we will die.

444
00:19:55.662 --> 00:19:57.342
We are ensuring everything.

445
00:19:57.342 --> 00:20:00.902
We're signing a contract on all of that making sure,

446
00:20:00.902 --> 00:20:02.922
you know, we're making sure that these things

447
00:20:02.922 --> 00:20:03.642
are gonna happen.

448
00:20:03.642 --> 00:20:05.102
And I've had to deal with that

449
00:20:05.102 --> 00:20:06.842
when I worked in the corporate world.

450
00:20:06.842 --> 00:20:10.602
And I'll make a quick story.

451
00:20:10.602 --> 00:20:12.542
I worked for a huge company

452
00:20:12.542 --> 00:20:16.486
and they wanted group insurance for everyone.

453
00:20:16.486 --> 00:20:20.306
And I don't do insurance.

454
00:20:20.306 --> 00:20:22.306
I never have.

455
00:20:22.306 --> 00:20:24.886
But the dental insurance, when they came along that,

456
00:20:24.886 --> 00:20:27.207
"Okay, well, I'll take the dental insurance."

457
00:20:27.207 --> 00:20:29.747
Well, I signed it and she says,

458
00:20:29.747 --> 00:20:31.258
"Oh, no, you must sign here

459
00:20:32.588 --> 00:20:34.582
"for the life insurances," well, I don't want that.

460
00:20:34.582 --> 00:20:36.299
She said, "Well, it's free."

461
00:20:36.299 --> 00:20:37.840
I says, "But I don't want it."

462
00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.459
Oh, my gosh, that turned into a huge thing

463
00:20:39.459 --> 00:20:40.240
because they said,

464
00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.699
"We cannot do this group insurance with this company

465
00:20:42.699 --> 00:20:45.299
"unless you sign this,

466
00:20:45.299 --> 00:20:47.459
"participate because it's a group thing."

467
00:20:47.459 --> 00:20:49.037
But I said, "But I don't wanna insure my life.

468
00:20:49.037 --> 00:20:51.217
"It's my life."

469
00:20:51.217 --> 00:20:52.518
That turned into a big thing.

470
00:20:52.518 --> 00:20:56.217
And then they couldn't do the insurance right away

471
00:20:56.217 --> 00:20:58.497
for everybody until they resolved this.

472
00:20:58.497 --> 00:21:00.597
So they had to go back to the company.

473
00:21:00.597 --> 00:21:02.238
They called me and said, "Are you sure?

474
00:21:02.238 --> 00:21:05.317
"Why don't you want it, is it religious reasons?"

475
00:21:05.317 --> 00:21:06.997
"I don't wanna insure my life."

476
00:21:06.997 --> 00:21:08.599
"As long as you're an employee, you have to."

477
00:21:08.599 --> 00:21:10.022
I said, "Well, tell you what,

478
00:21:10.022 --> 00:21:12.582
"make me an independent contractor."

479
00:21:12.582 --> 00:21:14.842
I was willing to quit.

480
00:21:14.842 --> 00:21:18.122
For me, it was the principle of the thing,

481
00:21:18.122 --> 00:21:19.542
it was my life.

482
00:21:19.542 --> 00:21:20.542
It's my life.

483
00:21:20.542 --> 00:21:23.042
I didn't want life insurance.

484
00:21:23.042 --> 00:21:25.262
And then the president said to me, he said,

485
00:21:25.262 --> 00:21:28.402
"Well, what if something happened to you tomorrow?"

486
00:21:28.402 --> 00:21:29.862
"Then I won't need it."

487
00:21:29.862 --> 00:21:31.022
"But what about your family?"

488
00:21:31.022 --> 00:21:35.582
So it's that whole cycle of programming and fear

489
00:21:35.582 --> 00:21:38.242
that we end up having around

490
00:21:38.242 --> 00:21:41.062
what the social norms are

491
00:21:41.062 --> 00:21:42.962
and who created these rules.

492
00:21:42.962 --> 00:21:44.382
They're all just programs.

493
00:21:44.382 --> 00:21:47.062
And our bodies listen to these programs

494
00:21:47.062 --> 00:21:48.822
and they say, okay, the cells go,

495
00:21:48.822 --> 00:21:51.282
"This is what we're working on."

496
00:21:51.282 --> 00:21:52.343
I already knew that.

497
00:21:52.343 --> 00:21:53.943
So I said, "No."

498
00:21:53.943 --> 00:21:58.283
This is my life, I'm going to be here for a long time.

499
00:21:58.283 --> 00:21:59.923
I know what I need to do

500
00:21:59.923 --> 00:22:03.243
'cause I know that we don't live long enough to evolve

501
00:22:03.243 --> 00:22:05.220
you know, as we could.

502
00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.560
So, anyway, that's a whole other show.

503
00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.420
But the point is, people need to understand

504
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.780
what they're crying for at this time

505
00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.407
especially with this health care situation.

506
00:22:15.377 --> 00:22:16.936
People want this free.

507
00:22:16.936 --> 00:22:20.697
And I think people want it because they feel entitled to it

508
00:22:20.697 --> 00:22:22.157
but I think they need to start asking,

509
00:22:22.157 --> 00:22:23.597
"What am I asking for?

510
00:22:23.597 --> 00:22:25.437
"What am I really entitled to?

511
00:22:25.437 --> 00:22:26.857
"What am I asking for?"

512
00:22:26.857 --> 00:22:29.497
You're asking for someone else

513
00:22:29.497 --> 00:22:31.497
to take charge of your life.

514
00:22:31.497 --> 00:22:33.417
Your life force, I’m talking about

515
00:22:33.417 --> 00:22:35.157
not just your general life

516
00:22:35.157 --> 00:22:37.217
but your life force.

517
00:22:37.217 --> 00:22:40.177
I wanna make sure if something happens to me,

518
00:22:40.177 --> 00:22:42.556
you know, that I'm covered.

519
00:22:42.556 --> 00:22:44.137
Well, just thinking that

520
00:22:44.137 --> 00:22:45.817
that something is gonna happen to you

521
00:22:45.817 --> 00:22:48.517
or the prevention, preventive

522
00:22:48.517 --> 00:22:51.016
is saying that the possibility exist,

523
00:22:51.016 --> 00:22:52.977
that something could happen.

524
00:22:52.977 --> 00:22:55.594
So, those are very crucial aspects

525
00:22:55.594 --> 00:22:57.634
and I know there are people that will say,

526
00:22:57.634 --> 00:22:59.574
"Well, yeah, but that's all well and good."

527
00:22:59.574 --> 00:23:02.753
But I think you have to do what is working for you.

528
00:23:02.753 --> 00:23:03.753
<v Voiceover>You're not saying</v>

529
00:23:03.753 --> 00:23:06.631
abandon all your insurance, your health insurance

530
00:23:06.631 --> 00:23:08.611
and other insurance policies, current trends,

531
00:23:08.611 --> 00:23:10.809
you're just using it to illustrate

532
00:23:10.809 --> 00:23:12.783
how we buy into these programs.

533
00:23:12.783 --> 00:23:13.683
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

534
00:23:13.683 --> 00:23:15.443
And you must know why you're doing what you're doing.

535
00:23:15.443 --> 00:23:16.624
It's very important.

536
00:23:16.624 --> 00:23:18.564
And it can't just be because

537
00:23:18.564 --> 00:23:20.663
you're told that you need to this.

538
00:23:20.663 --> 00:23:21.743
Because you can change,

539
00:23:21.743 --> 00:23:23.064
you can go ahead and have your insurance

540
00:23:23.064 --> 00:23:25.464
but you can put a whole different spin on it,

541
00:23:25.464 --> 00:23:26.784
energy wise,

542
00:23:26.784 --> 00:23:28.743
because you're not buying into it

543
00:23:28.743 --> 00:23:30.824
based on what the program is.

544
00:23:30.824 --> 00:23:32.464
So I'm not saying to throw it out.

545
00:23:32.464 --> 00:23:34.963
And you should never discard anything you do

546
00:23:34.963 --> 00:23:36.564
based on what anyone else says

547
00:23:36.564 --> 00:23:38.284
because it's all about knowing.

548
00:23:38.284 --> 00:23:42.024
You have to know your way into your changes.

549
00:23:42.024 --> 00:23:44.544
You cannot memorize your way into your changes

550
00:23:44.544 --> 00:23:48.303
and you can't take on a change because someone else

551
00:23:48.303 --> 00:23:51.464
has told you to take on that change, it will not work.

552
00:23:51.464 --> 00:23:52.304
It will not work.

553
00:23:52.304 --> 00:23:53.883
You have to know it.

554
00:23:53.883 --> 00:23:55.323
You have to grow into that change

555
00:23:55.323 --> 00:23:58.523
and become your understanding

556
00:23:58.523 --> 00:24:01.243
so that it unfolds the way it should for the individual.

557
00:24:01.243 --> 00:24:02.144
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about another</v>

558
00:24:02.144 --> 00:24:03.851
energetic program, money.

559
00:24:06.281 --> 00:24:10.154
You write a link about that one and that is

560
00:24:10.154 --> 00:24:12.015
definitely has a lot of people

561
00:24:12.015 --> 00:24:14.332
in the vulnerable position as we speak.

562
00:24:14.332 --> 00:24:15.632
<v ->Right, right.</v>

563
00:24:15.632 --> 00:24:17.653
I think right now with

564
00:24:17.653 --> 00:24:19.013
what's going on with the economy,

565
00:24:19.013 --> 00:24:21.132
I think that,

566
00:24:21.132 --> 00:24:23.212
my advice to a lot of people

567
00:24:23.212 --> 00:24:25.393
at other times is that

568
00:24:25.393 --> 00:24:28.892
you wanna look at everything as an opportunity right now

569
00:24:28.892 --> 00:24:33.033
and I see it as a grand opportunity for a lot of people.

570
00:24:33.033 --> 00:24:34.673
There are many people who have said,

571
00:24:34.673 --> 00:24:36.173
"I guess, I can't stand my job.

572
00:24:36.173 --> 00:24:38.153
"I hate my job."

573
00:24:38.153 --> 00:24:40.053
And they're caught now in this loop

574
00:24:40.053 --> 00:24:41.392
because they don't realize

575
00:24:41.392 --> 00:24:43.467
the only reason why you caught on this loop right now

576
00:24:43.467 --> 00:24:44.867
where you're laid off

577
00:24:44.867 --> 00:24:49.187
is because you did say that you didn't like your job

578
00:24:49.187 --> 00:24:51.527
and you wish you didn't have to this anymore.

579
00:24:51.527 --> 00:24:55.048
And now this opportunity has come.

580
00:24:55.048 --> 00:24:56.288
But we get lost in that.

581
00:24:56.288 --> 00:24:58.028
And then we talk to other people who says,

582
00:24:58.028 --> 00:24:59.347
"What are you gonna do?

583
00:24:59.347 --> 00:25:01.628
"What are you gonna do about this?"

584
00:25:01.628 --> 00:25:03.268
You have to back away

585
00:25:03.268 --> 00:25:06.407
from those kinds of conversations.

586
00:25:06.407 --> 00:25:09.327
And you have to really examine what is it

587
00:25:09.327 --> 00:25:11.267
that I would like to do?

588
00:25:11.267 --> 00:25:14.927
If I did not see any obstacles with myself,

589
00:25:14.927 --> 00:25:18.247
what is it that I would like to do with my life?

590
00:25:18.247 --> 00:25:19.967
<v Voiceover>That's a terrifying thought for most people.</v>

591
00:25:19.967 --> 00:25:21.308
<v ->It's a terrifying thought.</v>

592
00:25:21.308 --> 00:25:23.033
<v Voiceover>Capable of going there.</v>

593
00:25:23.033 --> 00:25:24.138
<v ->And not everybody is--</v>

594
00:25:24.138 --> 00:25:25.537
<v Voiceover>Too many restrictions, too many programs.</v>

595
00:25:25.537 --> 00:25:26.297
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

596
00:25:26.297 --> 00:25:29.218
Not everybody is cut out to be an entrepreneur for one.

597
00:25:29.218 --> 00:25:30.098
It's just the way it is.

598
00:25:30.098 --> 00:25:32.078
Not everybody is cut out for that.

599
00:25:32.078 --> 00:25:33.998
But, you can look at some other options,

600
00:25:33.998 --> 00:25:35.599
maybe you wanna go back to school,

601
00:25:35.599 --> 00:25:38.519
maybe it's something you've always wanted to study.

602
00:25:38.519 --> 00:25:40.615
There's so many other possibilities

603
00:25:40.615 --> 00:25:41.735
and you have to look at

604
00:25:41.735 --> 00:25:43.735
everything that happens to you as a possibility.

605
00:25:43.735 --> 00:25:45.655
You see the possibilities in it

606
00:25:45.655 --> 00:25:48.455
or the potential for something new.

607
00:25:48.455 --> 00:25:50.595
And I think for me,

608
00:25:50.595 --> 00:25:54.475
what I like about my life is that

609
00:25:54.475 --> 00:25:56.735
I can say these things

610
00:25:56.735 --> 00:25:58.675
because I've experienced so much.

611
00:25:58.675 --> 00:26:01.416
So I am not saying these things based on the fact

612
00:26:01.416 --> 00:26:04.535
that everything has gone so smoothly for me

613
00:26:04.535 --> 00:26:07.075
and I don't know what it's like to be

614
00:26:07.075 --> 00:26:09.595
absolutely broke or, you know,

615
00:26:09.595 --> 00:26:13.564
or to sleep in my car

616
00:26:13.564 --> 00:26:15.107
after getting a divorce,

617
00:26:15.107 --> 00:26:18.045
after leaving my husband, an abusive situation.

618
00:26:18.045 --> 00:26:20.904
And sleeping in my car, that by choice.

619
00:26:20.904 --> 00:26:23.384
So I recognized the choices that I made

620
00:26:23.384 --> 00:26:25.664
and I embrace my choices.

621
00:26:25.664 --> 00:26:29.325
And so I know what it is like to have to climb,

622
00:26:29.325 --> 00:26:34.105
to pull yourself up from absolutely point zero,

623
00:26:34.105 --> 00:26:35.345
the absolutely nothing

624
00:26:35.345 --> 00:26:36.725
which is how we got here in the first place,

625
00:26:36.725 --> 00:26:38.056
anyway, we come from nothing.

626
00:26:39.667 --> 00:26:42.687
We come from nothing and here we are.

627
00:26:42.687 --> 00:26:44.467
<v Voiceover>Well, how was that for you when,</v>

628
00:26:44.467 --> 00:26:46.749
as you said, when you're going through those explorations,

629
00:26:46.749 --> 00:26:50.249
when you left your husband and was sleeping in a car,

630
00:26:50.249 --> 00:26:53.683
how was it in your mind in terms to feel the possibilities?

631
00:26:54.693 --> 00:26:56.413
<v ->I was so happy</v>

632
00:26:56.413 --> 00:26:57.913
that I wasn't in that situation anymore.

633
00:26:57.913 --> 00:27:00.804
Sleeping in my car was just like, oh, it was a dream.

634
00:27:02.554 --> 00:27:04.054
And I left everything behind,

635
00:27:04.054 --> 00:27:05.454
so understand that.

636
00:27:05.454 --> 00:27:06.914
I left everything behind.

637
00:27:06.914 --> 00:27:10.254
I just walked out, I left.

638
00:27:10.254 --> 00:27:12.834
So for me, it took me a moment

639
00:27:12.834 --> 00:27:15.154
to really see the possibilities

640
00:27:15.154 --> 00:27:17.034
because now I needed to figure out

641
00:27:17.034 --> 00:27:18.175
okay, the two kids,

642
00:27:18.175 --> 00:27:19.775
I'm locked away from the bank account.

643
00:27:19.775 --> 00:27:22.055
I can't even get in there.

644
00:27:22.055 --> 00:27:23.556
<v Voiceover>Out of the money matrix.</v>

645
00:27:23.556 --> 00:27:25.376
<v ->Exactly, I mean I'm going--</v>

646
00:27:25.376 --> 00:27:26.736
I have nothing.

647
00:27:26.736 --> 00:27:29.356
I'm literally, and you don't wanna call anybody.

648
00:27:29.356 --> 00:27:31.076
I didn't wanna

649
00:27:31.076 --> 00:27:34.887
incorporate other people into my circumstances.

650
00:27:36.457 --> 00:27:39.307
'Cause I ran away is basically what it is.

651
00:27:39.307 --> 00:27:42.095
So, I now had to figure out

652
00:27:42.095 --> 00:27:44.355
how I was going to pull myself up.

653
00:27:44.355 --> 00:27:47.335
And that was 17 years ago.

654
00:27:47.335 --> 00:27:49.335
And I had to pull myself up.

655
00:27:49.335 --> 00:27:52.535
And I had to at that moment which I didn't understand

656
00:27:52.535 --> 00:27:54.295
what I understand now.

657
00:27:54.295 --> 00:27:58.395
But I remember when things really hit the fan for me

658
00:27:58.395 --> 00:28:00.135
and I thought, okay, I've gotta get these kids.

659
00:28:00.135 --> 00:28:01.191
I've gotta get an apartment.

660
00:28:01.191 --> 00:28:03.251
I've gotta get the kids into an apartment

661
00:28:03.251 --> 00:28:04.611
and I didn't know what to do.

662
00:28:04.611 --> 00:28:08.711
So I remember really going into myself

663
00:28:08.711 --> 00:28:10.791
and really saying,

664
00:28:10.791 --> 00:28:15.331
"Okay, something is got to give right now."

665
00:28:15.331 --> 00:28:17.271
And with such certainty,

666
00:28:17.271 --> 00:28:19.051
and that's what it is, you have to,

667
00:28:19.051 --> 00:28:21.111
there has to be certainty.

668
00:28:21.111 --> 00:28:22.371
It can't be wavering.

669
00:28:22.371 --> 00:28:24.711
It can't be a little bit of, "Oh, I hope--."

670
00:28:24.711 --> 00:28:26.411
or it can't be a little bit of,

671
00:28:26.411 --> 00:28:28.191
"Oh, well, you know, it's something--."

672
00:28:28.191 --> 00:28:30.887
No, it's gotta be no, now!

673
00:28:30.887 --> 00:28:32.451
<v Voiceover>You're committing your energy--</v>

674
00:28:32.451 --> 00:28:33.107
<v ->That's right.</v>

675
00:28:33.107 --> 00:28:34.407
The Neo, you know, Neos know.

676
00:28:34.407 --> 00:28:36.273
When Neo said no, that's the no you've got,

677
00:28:36.273 --> 00:28:38.353
that's the certainty you've gotta come with.

678
00:28:38.353 --> 00:28:40.447
And that certainty

679
00:28:40.447 --> 00:28:44.148
is what really got me out of that situation

680
00:28:44.148 --> 00:28:46.507
and eventually into an apartment.

681
00:28:46.507 --> 00:28:49.264
Of course, yes, I did have to get some assistance

682
00:28:49.264 --> 00:28:51.424
so I know what that's like to,

683
00:28:51.424 --> 00:28:53.000
I ended up having to college

684
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.034
or someone said, "Okay, we'll call this place."

685
00:28:55.034 --> 00:28:56.297
And they help you.

686
00:28:56.297 --> 00:28:57.397
So here I am.

687
00:28:57.397 --> 00:28:58.757
Didn't matter how educated I was.

688
00:28:58.757 --> 00:29:00.877
It didn't matter what I had.

689
00:29:00.877 --> 00:29:02.557
I didn't have that anymore.

690
00:29:02.557 --> 00:29:05.097
I'm starting over from scratch.

691
00:29:05.097 --> 00:29:08.377
But I was happy 'cause I was gonna start over

692
00:29:08.377 --> 00:29:10.636
regardless of what my circumstances were.

693
00:29:10.636 --> 00:29:11.936
(indistinct talking)

694
00:29:11.936 --> 00:29:13.456
Oh, absolutely.

695
00:29:13.456 --> 00:29:16.616
Oh, yeah, starting over can be powerful.

696
00:29:16.616 --> 00:29:18.937
It was that starting over

697
00:29:18.937 --> 00:29:20.576
that lead to this book.

698
00:29:20.576 --> 00:29:23.736
That starting over lead

699
00:29:23.736 --> 00:29:26.916
to everything that I now understand

700
00:29:26.916 --> 00:29:28.337
and it was a butt kicker.

701
00:29:28.337 --> 00:29:30.336
I'm not saying it was easy

702
00:29:30.336 --> 00:29:31.958
but there was diligence.

703
00:29:31.958 --> 00:29:34.498
There was such diligence in

704
00:29:34.498 --> 00:29:36.530
wanting to understand

705
00:29:37.719 --> 00:29:40.161
what was happening, where I am.

706
00:29:40.161 --> 00:29:42.781
There's got to be something more powerful here.

707
00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:44.060
There's got to be.

708
00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.860
And those circumstances,

709
00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:49.221
and I was saying earlier today, I'm so grateful

710
00:29:49.221 --> 00:29:52.080
to my ex-husband

711
00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.862
because he has read my book three times

712
00:29:53.862 --> 00:29:55.922
and he absolutely love it.

713
00:29:55.922 --> 00:29:57.721
He loves it.

714
00:29:57.721 --> 00:29:59.981
And what I say to people is,

715
00:29:59.981 --> 00:30:01.163
regardless, there's like,

716
00:30:01.163 --> 00:30:02.462
there going, "You're not mad at--?"

717
00:30:02.462 --> 00:30:03.443
No, I'm not.

718
00:30:03.443 --> 00:30:04.863
I'm not upset with him.

719
00:30:04.863 --> 00:30:06.423
And I tell you why.

720
00:30:06.423 --> 00:30:08.263
All the people

721
00:30:08.263 --> 00:30:10.943
that seem to have really done you in

722
00:30:10.943 --> 00:30:13.143
on a much more profound level

723
00:30:13.143 --> 00:30:15.323
outside of this time and space,

724
00:30:15.323 --> 00:30:18.302
there was a profound amount of love

725
00:30:18.302 --> 00:30:19.963
when they did this.

726
00:30:19.963 --> 00:30:22.003
And a lot of people have a hard time seeing that.

727
00:30:22.003 --> 00:30:24.363
It was a profound amount of love

728
00:30:24.363 --> 00:30:26.422
that we do have for each other

729
00:30:26.422 --> 00:30:28.523
beyond this time and space.

730
00:30:28.523 --> 00:30:30.102
<v Voiceover>Beyond our emotional bodies.</v>

731
00:30:30.102 --> 00:30:32.263
<v ->Beyond our emotional bodies.</v>

732
00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:34.763
And he provided me,

733
00:30:34.763 --> 00:30:38.803
what he provided me with for the 14 years

734
00:30:38.803 --> 00:30:42.403
allowed me to have a level of strength

735
00:30:42.403 --> 00:30:45.262
because this journey does require a strength

736
00:30:45.262 --> 00:30:48.103
especially if you're deciding that

737
00:30:48.103 --> 00:30:50.823
you are really piercing the veil

738
00:30:50.823 --> 00:30:54.743
and you are really going beyond package concepts.

739
00:30:54.743 --> 00:30:55.983
And that's what I saw.

740
00:30:55.983 --> 00:30:58.603
When I saw

741
00:30:58.603 --> 00:31:02.363
how limitless it was, I'm going.

742
00:31:02.363 --> 00:31:03.384
And whatever that is,

743
00:31:03.384 --> 00:31:06.724
I'm taking it and I'm riding the wave.

744
00:31:06.724 --> 00:31:09.963
So what I went through made me strong,

745
00:31:09.963 --> 00:31:12.044
made me extremely strong.

746
00:31:12.044 --> 00:31:15.044
And the other thing that I wanna say is that

747
00:31:15.044 --> 00:31:19.244
the beauty is that, because I was not angry with him,

748
00:31:19.244 --> 00:31:22.704
once I understood it and I moved pass to all of that,

749
00:31:22.704 --> 00:31:26.343
it allowed this man to be able to

750
00:31:26.343 --> 00:31:28.463
not have to hold that charge

751
00:31:28.463 --> 00:31:31.124
because we have to have a positive and a negative charge,

752
00:31:31.124 --> 00:31:34.164
you have that two points

753
00:31:34.164 --> 00:31:36.524
to make something happen.

754
00:31:36.524 --> 00:31:38.324
I no longer had that.

755
00:31:38.324 --> 00:31:40.903
So he didn't have to hold anything.

756
00:31:40.903 --> 00:31:43.784
He now had to still go

757
00:31:43.784 --> 00:31:48.143
and deal with the repercussions of his actions.

758
00:31:48.143 --> 00:31:49.984
He still had to deal with it anyway.

759
00:31:49.984 --> 00:31:51.423
Even though he did what he did

760
00:31:51.423 --> 00:31:53.404
and I thought, "Wow, thank you for that."

761
00:31:53.404 --> 00:31:54.464
He's still had to do that.

762
00:31:54.464 --> 00:31:57.044
And he's still had to

763
00:31:57.044 --> 00:31:59.983
unfold and move through it

764
00:31:59.983 --> 00:32:02.603
and become again and be reborn.

765
00:32:02.603 --> 00:32:06.264
And so he had to go through his own process of being reborn

766
00:32:06.264 --> 00:32:07.163
so it's essential.

767
00:32:07.163 --> 00:32:08.006
<v Voiceover>And you said this is important because</v>

768
00:32:08.006 --> 00:32:11.466
you said that every person that shows up in our lives,

769
00:32:11.466 --> 00:32:12.386
whatever it is,

770
00:32:12.386 --> 00:32:16.125
whether they're a mild irritant to a source of abuse

771
00:32:16.125 --> 00:32:17.706
is all been invited in by us.

772
00:32:17.706 --> 00:32:20.626
By absolutely placing our awareness on another being,

773
00:32:20.626 --> 00:32:22.227
we're now inviting whatever that

774
00:32:22.227 --> 00:32:26.077
being carries with them into our experience.

775
00:32:26.077 --> 00:32:27.927
<v ->Absolutely, because it's all,</v>

776
00:32:27.927 --> 00:32:29.768
you can look at it as,

777
00:32:29.768 --> 00:32:31.107
they're all characters.

778
00:32:31.107 --> 00:32:32.808
I mean, you have a script.

779
00:32:32.808 --> 00:32:37.728
And, you know, regardless of the fact that I do talk about

780
00:32:37.728 --> 00:32:41.368
the fact that we have our own private universe,

781
00:32:41.368 --> 00:32:43.108
our own private reality.

782
00:32:43.108 --> 00:32:45.949
And, yes, it is a show

783
00:32:45.949 --> 00:32:50.109
but you invite others in to play particular roles

784
00:32:50.109 --> 00:32:51.449
because we have to have that.

785
00:32:51.449 --> 00:32:53.289
You can't have the show by yourself.

786
00:32:53.289 --> 00:32:54.949
You could but it's not the same

787
00:32:54.949 --> 00:32:57.869
because you need them to allow the experience,

788
00:32:57.869 --> 00:32:59.349
whatever that process may be

789
00:32:59.349 --> 00:33:00.769
that you need to experience.

790
00:33:00.769 --> 00:33:03.109
So these parties come in

791
00:33:03.109 --> 00:33:04.949
and you hand them a script and they say,

792
00:33:04.949 --> 00:33:06.849
"This is the role I will play."

793
00:33:06.849 --> 00:33:07.769
And they play it out

794
00:33:07.769 --> 00:33:09.608
and it's absolutely awesome.

795
00:33:09.608 --> 00:33:11.829
We invite them in

796
00:33:11.829 --> 00:33:16.369
to participate and to allow us to play out

797
00:33:16.369 --> 00:33:17.430
what we've created.

798
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:18.829
You know, we create these holograms.

799
00:33:18.829 --> 00:33:22.471
We have our own holographic reality despite the fact that,

800
00:33:22.471 --> 00:33:27.371
yes, we are collectively sharing a holographic concept

801
00:33:27.371 --> 00:33:29.050
and I refer to everything as concepts

802
00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.311
because I believe that's what everything is,

803
00:33:31.311 --> 00:33:33.342
it's a concept, it's an idea.

804
00:33:34.592 --> 00:33:37.232
So they come in and they do what they do

805
00:33:37.232 --> 00:33:39.351
and then when it's time for them to go,

806
00:33:39.351 --> 00:33:40.691
and then they go.

807
00:33:40.691 --> 00:33:43.152
And that's what people are afraid of to is to change.

808
00:33:43.152 --> 00:33:47.392
The process of change is what we tend to fear.

809
00:33:47.392 --> 00:33:49.092
And we say, "Why don't relationships work?

810
00:33:49.092 --> 00:33:51.292
"Why don't these marriages work?"

811
00:33:51.292 --> 00:33:52.912
I say that they all work.

812
00:33:52.912 --> 00:33:55.511
I just say that, "It's providing you

813
00:33:55.511 --> 00:33:57.092
"with what you need at that moment."

814
00:33:57.092 --> 00:33:58.032
Now, for those people

815
00:33:58.032 --> 00:34:00.113
whom the marriage might last 50 0r 60 years,

816
00:34:00.113 --> 00:34:02.093
then that was what they needed.

817
00:34:02.093 --> 00:34:05.453
They happen to find the mate that would carry them

818
00:34:05.453 --> 00:34:08.713
through this particular process of time

819
00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:10.272
but they all work.

820
00:34:10.272 --> 00:34:13.233
It's a matter of what did you gain from them,

821
00:34:13.233 --> 00:34:14.352
what did you gain from them,

822
00:34:14.352 --> 00:34:17.633
what choices will you make beyond

823
00:34:17.633 --> 00:34:20.954
those relationships that no longer exist.

824
00:34:20.954 --> 00:34:22.154
<v Voiceover>When you talked about this,</v>

825
00:34:22.154 --> 00:34:23.034
a lot of people think,

826
00:34:23.034 --> 00:34:25.354
"Oh, well, where does karma come into play?"

827
00:34:25.354 --> 00:34:27.934
And we spoke a little bit about past lives earlier

828
00:34:27.934 --> 00:34:29.654
about past, present,future lives,

829
00:34:29.654 --> 00:34:31.976
but let's talk about your notion of karma

830
00:34:31.976 --> 00:34:33.876
as you speak about it.

831
00:34:33.876 --> 00:34:36.856
<v ->The way I view karma is probably pretty similar</v>

832
00:34:36.856 --> 00:34:38.516
to how everybody else does.

833
00:34:38.516 --> 00:34:40.736
For example when I talked about my ex-husband

834
00:34:40.736 --> 00:34:42.796
and he did give me permission to, he says,

835
00:34:42.796 --> 00:34:45.339
"If you have anything that I've done,

836
00:34:45.339 --> 00:34:47.539
"if you need to use it to help somebody else,"

837
00:34:47.539 --> 00:34:49.662
he says, "I'm fine with that."

838
00:34:49.662 --> 00:34:50.642
<v Voiceover>That's good.</v>

839
00:34:50.642 --> 00:34:51.602
That's very generous of him.

840
00:34:51.602 --> 00:34:53.542
<v ->Yeah, and that was part of his process.</v>

841
00:34:53.542 --> 00:34:56.682
So for example,

842
00:34:56.682 --> 00:34:58.562
he ended up having to,

843
00:34:58.562 --> 00:34:59.943
in this life he happened to,

844
00:34:59.943 --> 00:35:03.043
in this life, deal with some of those circumstances.

845
00:35:03.043 --> 00:35:04.083
But I understand why

846
00:35:04.083 --> 00:35:05.523
because of the kind of person that he is

847
00:35:05.523 --> 00:35:09.123
and the unfolding, he decided to unfold very quickly

848
00:35:09.123 --> 00:35:11.063
and to move through what he did.

849
00:35:11.063 --> 00:35:14.483
So he did go through some intense circumstances

850
00:35:14.483 --> 00:35:16.643
but it was all the balance.

851
00:35:16.643 --> 00:35:19.143
So there is a balance that happens.

852
00:35:19.143 --> 00:35:20.223
Because it's all, what?

853
00:35:20.223 --> 00:35:22.343
It's all frequency patterns.

854
00:35:22.343 --> 00:35:24.393
Everything is measurable.

855
00:35:24.393 --> 00:35:28.245
Everything is, every thought, every action

856
00:35:28.245 --> 00:35:29.885
there is a frequency to it.

857
00:35:29.885 --> 00:35:33.085
And so it's the frequency more than anything else.

858
00:35:33.085 --> 00:35:35.005
It's that we're dealing with.

859
00:35:35.005 --> 00:35:39.945
And so whatever goes out in terms of a particular vibration,

860
00:35:39.945 --> 00:35:44.375
or a particular frequency,

861
00:35:44.375 --> 00:35:46.767
the response is going to be equivalent

862
00:35:46.767 --> 00:35:49.447
to that vibration or that frequency.

863
00:35:49.447 --> 00:35:53.627
And so if we start thinking in terms of that,

864
00:35:53.627 --> 00:35:56.167
that kind of that context.

865
00:35:56.167 --> 00:35:58.707
Things are simplified to us

866
00:35:58.707 --> 00:36:00.287
and it's not just simply,

867
00:36:00.287 --> 00:36:01.977
oh, you know, we've got, you know, it's a karma.

868
00:36:01.977 --> 00:36:02.702
It's karma.

869
00:36:02.702 --> 00:36:05.042
We have to understand everything is measurable.

870
00:36:05.042 --> 00:36:06.521
Everything is being measured.

871
00:36:06.521 --> 00:36:08.941
It's all energy and that's what you're dealing with.

872
00:36:08.941 --> 00:36:09.881
<v Voiceover>Good, better and different.</v>

873
00:36:09.881 --> 00:36:10.861
<v ->Good, better and different.</v>

874
00:36:10.861 --> 00:36:11.981
It's all measured.

875
00:36:11.981 --> 00:36:14.281
So that throws out the good and the bad thing either.

876
00:36:14.281 --> 00:36:16.231
The whole concept of good and bad.

877
00:36:16.231 --> 00:36:17.759
It's all resonance.

878
00:36:17.759 --> 00:36:19.958
So it's not that,

879
00:36:19.958 --> 00:36:22.258
this is better or I like you better,

880
00:36:22.258 --> 00:36:24.038
it has nothing to do with that.

881
00:36:24.038 --> 00:36:25.398
We have a resonance.

882
00:36:25.398 --> 00:36:28.779
If we have a resonance, then that's what I'm working with.

883
00:36:28.779 --> 00:36:30.759
I don't have a favorite color,

884
00:36:30.759 --> 00:36:34.038
I go with what resonates with me at that moment.

885
00:36:34.038 --> 00:36:35.439
So that's how I operate.

886
00:36:35.439 --> 00:36:38.178
So it's all resonance in the same thing you're dealing with

887
00:36:38.178 --> 00:36:41.478
when you're dealing the concept of karma.

888
00:36:41.478 --> 00:36:44.219
With that said, the idea of karma

889
00:36:44.219 --> 00:36:46.519
when we look at the world

890
00:36:46.519 --> 00:36:51.519
and my thoughts on this are a bit different than

891
00:36:51.655 --> 00:36:52.755
than many people.

892
00:36:52.755 --> 00:36:54.836
But when we look at the world out there

893
00:36:54.836 --> 00:36:56.096
and we wanna change it,

894
00:36:56.096 --> 00:36:57.715
and we wanna fix it,

895
00:36:57.715 --> 00:36:59.296
that's not it

896
00:36:59.296 --> 00:37:02.755
because I don't know every single individual on the planet.

897
00:37:02.755 --> 00:37:04.535
I don't know what their journey is.

898
00:37:04.535 --> 00:37:05.675
And I cannot,

899
00:37:05.675 --> 00:37:07.855
how dare me decide

900
00:37:07.855 --> 00:37:11.235
that your reality needs to change

901
00:37:11.235 --> 00:37:14.032
to what I think, your reality needs to change you.

902
00:37:14.032 --> 00:37:15.653
But what I can do is,

903
00:37:15.653 --> 00:37:18.693
I can change my perception of reality

904
00:37:18.693 --> 00:37:20.609
because it's all holographic anyway.

905
00:37:20.609 --> 00:37:23.389
And it's the changing of your reality

906
00:37:23.389 --> 00:37:27.330
that's going to determine the concept of reality

907
00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:29.709
that you continue to experience

908
00:37:29.709 --> 00:37:34.430
in what you see as the illusion of external reality

909
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:35.729
because that's what you're dealing with,

910
00:37:35.729 --> 00:37:37.656
it's an illusion anyway.

911
00:37:38.866 --> 00:37:42.007
And so when you begin to change that

912
00:37:42.007 --> 00:37:43.307
and you begin to understand that

913
00:37:43.307 --> 00:37:46.106
you really do represent the totality,

914
00:37:46.106 --> 00:37:47.627
you represent the whole,

915
00:37:47.627 --> 00:37:49.227
then all you need to do is

916
00:37:49.227 --> 00:37:52.008
work on what is necessary for you

917
00:37:52.008 --> 00:37:54.607
and then that will determine

918
00:37:54.607 --> 00:37:57.146
what your interaction will be with

919
00:37:57.146 --> 00:38:00.506
what you perceived to be external reality.

920
00:38:00.506 --> 00:38:02.266
So that's how I approach things.

921
00:38:02.266 --> 00:38:03.586
I know, I don't pray for peace,

922
00:38:03.586 --> 00:38:05.346
I don't do any of those things

923
00:38:05.346 --> 00:38:07.006
because I understand that.

924
00:38:07.006 --> 00:38:08.187
<v Voiceover>You changed your perception.</v>

925
00:38:08.187 --> 00:38:09.926
<v ->I changed my perception.</v>

926
00:38:09.926 --> 00:38:11.146
<v Voiceover>And when you talk about</v>

927
00:38:11.146 --> 00:38:12.904
perceptions and illusions,

928
00:38:12.904 --> 00:38:15.904
one of them you talked about is death and immortality.

929
00:38:15.904 --> 00:38:17.044
The illusion of death

930
00:38:17.044 --> 00:38:19.863
and the human potential for immortality,

931
00:38:19.863 --> 00:38:22.243
I think that's a good place for us to go now.

932
00:38:22.243 --> 00:38:23.863
<v ->Okay, that's an interesting one</v>

933
00:38:23.863 --> 00:38:26.081
because I've really come out of the closet.

934
00:38:27.921 --> 00:38:29.262
I came out of the closet on that.

935
00:38:29.262 --> 00:38:31.742
You know, these are all things that I

936
00:38:31.742 --> 00:38:33.302
really started to discover.

937
00:38:33.302 --> 00:38:34.982
And even as a child,

938
00:38:34.982 --> 00:38:37.002
I though it was very odd

939
00:38:37.002 --> 00:38:40.601
that nobody thought anything about people

940
00:38:40.601 --> 00:38:42.002
being born and people dying.

941
00:38:42.002 --> 00:38:45.802
It was so accepted that it was so bizarre to me.

942
00:38:45.802 --> 00:38:48.261
And I always refer to it as a huge airport

943
00:38:48.261 --> 00:38:49.881
with arrivals and departures.

944
00:38:49.881 --> 00:38:51.402
I'm like, people coming and going.

945
00:38:51.402 --> 00:38:54.100
I'm like, doesn't anybody think this is weird?

946
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.079
Oh, no, it was like people are planning for their funerals.

947
00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:57.938
I'm like, this is weird people,

948
00:38:57.938 --> 00:38:59.838
there's something off about this.

949
00:38:59.838 --> 00:39:01.678
So it never made sense to me.

950
00:39:01.678 --> 00:39:03.278
Of course, as I would go along

951
00:39:03.278 --> 00:39:04.638
I started to understand.

952
00:39:04.638 --> 00:39:07.158
I thought, oh, this is what's going on.

953
00:39:07.158 --> 00:39:09.418
And what I began to understand

954
00:39:09.418 --> 00:39:13.578
is that human beings, yes, we don't live long enough.

955
00:39:13.578 --> 00:39:15.738
Not that we can't but we don't live long enough

956
00:39:15.738 --> 00:39:18.466
to begin to acquire

957
00:39:20.578 --> 00:39:22.676
higher levels of that of memory

958
00:39:22.676 --> 00:39:27.676
or to expand our consciousness to a certain space,

959
00:39:28.971 --> 00:39:30.710
not that there is an ultimate end

960
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:33.251
but to a certain space that would take you

961
00:39:33.251 --> 00:39:37.111
beyond this matrix or the game as we know it.

962
00:39:37.111 --> 00:39:39.308
And so,

963
00:39:39.308 --> 00:39:41.509
I was gonna tell you something else about that.

964
00:39:41.509 --> 00:39:43.988
With that said and in terms of

965
00:39:43.988 --> 00:39:45.827
the length that we live,

966
00:39:45.827 --> 00:39:48.966
what I also saw is that

967
00:39:48.966 --> 00:39:51.147
human DNA,

968
00:39:51.147 --> 00:39:52.987
we talked about junk DNA,

969
00:39:52.987 --> 00:39:55.647
98% of it, they don't know what it is.

970
00:39:55.647 --> 00:39:57.887
So what I've talked about is the fact that,

971
00:39:57.887 --> 00:40:02.567
I believe that there are codes in the DNA

972
00:40:02.567 --> 00:40:07.490
that can only be reactivated by the individual.

973
00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:08.530
By the individual.

974
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.510
That's why nobody can do this journey for you.

975
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:11.790
Nobody can save you.

976
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:12.970
Nobody can wake you up.

977
00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:14.790
Nobody can reactivate your body for you.

978
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:16.610
I don't care how much money you pay.

979
00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:17.990
It's just set up that way.

980
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:21.570
Your vehicle is your vehicle specifically designed for you

981
00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:25.050
and you are the only one that can reactivate that vehicle

982
00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:27.690
based on a shift in your consciousness.

983
00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:29.670
Now what I also realize is that

984
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:32.692
we no longer,

985
00:40:32.692 --> 00:40:36.052
in terms of the concept of reality

986
00:40:36.052 --> 00:40:39.612
that we see or most of us have,

987
00:40:39.612 --> 00:40:42.452
we don't notice anybody living

988
00:40:42.452 --> 00:40:44.352
up to a thousand years old.

989
00:40:44.352 --> 00:40:47.312
What I came to realize is that

990
00:40:47.312 --> 00:40:49.452
if we were to begin to live

991
00:40:49.452 --> 00:40:51.872
up to a certain period of time like a thousand,

992
00:40:51.872 --> 00:40:52.952
it's starts to,

993
00:40:52.952 --> 00:40:55.832
like a computer program, it's starts to override

994
00:40:55.832 --> 00:40:58.432
those programs of limitation

995
00:40:58.432 --> 00:41:03.432
and the original codes start to reactivate themselves.

996
00:41:04.933 --> 00:41:07.093
Is it because we wanna live in a body forever?

997
00:41:07.093 --> 00:41:08.013
No.

998
00:41:08.013 --> 00:41:09.333
It's not because of that.

999
00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:12.793
It's because the body has the potential

1000
00:41:12.793 --> 00:41:16.393
to shift along, move along

1001
00:41:16.393 --> 00:41:19.113
as we expand in our consciousness.

1002
00:41:19.113 --> 00:41:20.734
And as we're expanding in our consciousness,

1003
00:41:20.734 --> 00:41:22.614
as I said, consciousness,

1004
00:41:22.614 --> 00:41:24.034
the expansion of consciousness

1005
00:41:24.034 --> 00:41:26.294
is the expansion of self-awareness.

1006
00:41:26.294 --> 00:41:29.175
So you're grabbing larger and larger chunks

1007
00:41:29.175 --> 00:41:31.395
of self-awareness of you as source.

1008
00:41:31.395 --> 00:41:32.955
Obviously, you won't grab the whole thing

1009
00:41:32.955 --> 00:41:35.095
otherwise, you couldn't have the experience here.

1010
00:41:35.095 --> 00:41:39.435
So you're grabbing larger and larger aspects

1011
00:41:39.435 --> 00:41:43.195
of this self-awareness according to where you are.

1012
00:41:43.195 --> 00:41:47.095
As you do that, the body has the opportunity

1013
00:41:47.095 --> 00:41:51.295
to molecularly continue to shift with you

1014
00:41:51.295 --> 00:41:53.555
as that consciousness is expanding.

1015
00:41:53.555 --> 00:41:55.675
What we have happening however is,

1016
00:41:55.675 --> 00:42:00.015
we tend to discard the importance of the body

1017
00:42:00.015 --> 00:42:03.075
and we only want to focus on

1018
00:42:03.075 --> 00:42:05.055
what we call the spiritual stuff.

1019
00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:07.137
And 'cause a body just dies, it doesn't really matter.

1020
00:42:07.137 --> 00:42:08.788
No, that's a program.

1021
00:42:09.978 --> 00:42:13.898
A full ascension, or a real understanding of ascension,

1022
00:42:13.898 --> 00:42:18.658
it is about taking the body going along

1023
00:42:18.658 --> 00:42:20.938
with the shift in consciousness,

1024
00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:22.978
that could be over thousands of years.

1025
00:42:22.978 --> 00:42:26.489
But we have to get off the wheel of linear time.

1026
00:42:27.619 --> 00:42:30.999
We are programmed into the concept of linear time.

1027
00:42:30.999 --> 00:42:32.099
So once we start,

1028
00:42:32.099 --> 00:42:33.179
that's a whole other thing

1029
00:42:33.179 --> 00:42:35.579
in terms of understanding the concept time,

1030
00:42:35.579 --> 00:42:38.159
when we start to understand how that works,

1031
00:42:38.159 --> 00:42:40.759
and we get off the wheel of time,

1032
00:42:40.759 --> 00:42:43.039
we take the body off of the wheel of time.

1033
00:42:43.039 --> 00:42:45.619
Not that you don't operate around time,

1034
00:42:45.619 --> 00:42:47.439
you learn how to operate on time,

1035
00:42:47.439 --> 00:42:49.919
it's just that the concept of time that we live

1036
00:42:49.919 --> 00:42:51.779
no longer owns you.

1037
00:42:51.779 --> 00:42:54.619
Your body isn't tied into it in that manner.

1038
00:42:54.619 --> 00:42:57.339
And so that's starts to change a whole lot of things

1039
00:42:57.339 --> 00:43:01.259
in terms of the chemicals and hormones

1040
00:43:01.259 --> 00:43:05.299
and the brain that produces to reactivate in all of this.

1041
00:43:05.299 --> 00:43:06.799
This is all natural stuff.

1042
00:43:06.799 --> 00:43:08.260
<v Voiceover>I should say it happens very simply,</v>

1043
00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:12.280
you look at a certain person and say, "You're how old?"

1044
00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.201
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1045
00:43:13.201 --> 00:43:14.421
<v Voiceover>And they'll say, "Yeah."</v>

1046
00:43:14.421 --> 00:43:15.721
And you say, "Well, how do you do that?"

1047
00:43:15.721 --> 00:43:17.622
And they said,"I don't buy into the concept of aging."

1048
00:43:17.622 --> 00:43:18.542
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1049
00:43:18.542 --> 00:43:19.402
<v Voiceover>Which I agree with.</v>

1050
00:43:19.402 --> 00:43:20.202
<v ->That's what I do.</v>

1051
00:43:20.202 --> 00:43:21.142
<v Voiceover>Just don't even think about this.</v>

1052
00:43:21.142 --> 00:43:22.582
<v ->Absolutely, I'm a grandmother so,</v>

1053
00:43:22.582 --> 00:43:23.463
<v Voiceover>Yeah?</v>

1054
00:43:23.463 --> 00:43:24.953
You look like you're 17.

1055
00:43:24.953 --> 00:43:26.644
<v ->I'm a grandma.</v>

1056
00:43:26.644 --> 00:43:28.384
So, you know,

1057
00:43:28.384 --> 00:43:29.704
that, I don't--

1058
00:43:29.704 --> 00:43:30.684
<v Voiceover>It's detaching--</v>

1059
00:43:30.684 --> 00:43:31.804
<v ->It is.</v>

1060
00:43:31.804 --> 00:43:35.144
<v Voiceover>From the program of time, of linear time.</v>

1061
00:43:35.144 --> 00:43:37.835
We don't have to be able to

1062
00:43:37.835 --> 00:43:41.045
intellectually understand the notion of--

1063
00:43:41.045 --> 00:43:42.366
<v ->Stop running out of time though.</v>

1064
00:43:42.366 --> 00:43:44.387
<v Voiceover>Non-linear time and space</v>

1065
00:43:44.387 --> 00:43:46.067
but we do need to

1066
00:43:46.067 --> 00:43:48.167
at least be brave enough to disconnect from it.

1067
00:43:48.167 --> 00:43:49.047
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1068
00:43:49.047 --> 00:43:52.509
And the commercializing

1069
00:43:52.509 --> 00:43:55.009
of running out of time.

1070
00:43:55.009 --> 00:43:57.989
The marketing of you running out of time.

1071
00:43:57.989 --> 00:44:01.033
And that's the biggest thing that get us.

1072
00:44:01.033 --> 00:44:02.374
You're running out of time.

1073
00:44:02.374 --> 00:44:03.654
You're always running out of time

1074
00:44:03.654 --> 00:44:05.314
as far as the marketing companies are concerned.

1075
00:44:05.314 --> 00:44:06.574
You must do this by a certain time.

1076
00:44:06.574 --> 00:44:07.494
You gotta get--

1077
00:44:07.494 --> 00:44:08.355
<v Voiceover>Based on fear.</v>

1078
00:44:08.355 --> 00:44:09.055
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1079
00:44:09.055 --> 00:44:10.215
<v Voiceover>If you don't by the product</v>

1080
00:44:10.215 --> 00:44:11.335
then time runs out for you.

1081
00:44:11.335 --> 00:44:12.155
<v ->Then time runs out</v>

1082
00:44:12.155 --> 00:44:12.995
and you wanna look young

1083
00:44:12.995 --> 00:44:14.355
so you gotta buy this product.

1084
00:44:14.355 --> 00:44:17.495
You know, everything is based on, I'm running out of time.

1085
00:44:17.495 --> 00:44:19.895
And so everything about us is

1086
00:44:19.895 --> 00:44:22.715
is really programmed for running out of time.

1087
00:44:22.715 --> 00:44:24.176
We've have to have kids by a certain time,

1088
00:44:24.176 --> 00:44:25.936
we've gotta do this by a certain time,

1089
00:44:25.936 --> 00:44:28.697
we've got to get married by a certain time, and why?

1090
00:44:28.697 --> 00:44:29.757
Everything is saying,

1091
00:44:29.757 --> 00:44:32.297
"I must do this by a certain time before I die."

1092
00:44:32.297 --> 00:44:33.437
That's what everything is saying,

1093
00:44:33.437 --> 00:44:34.897
I'm gonna run out of time.

1094
00:44:34.897 --> 00:44:37.117
If I don't do this now, I'm gonna die.

1095
00:44:37.117 --> 00:44:40.238
<v Voiceover>Rather than choosing our experience</v>

1096
00:44:40.238 --> 00:44:42.878
in the moment as feels appropriate in that moment

1097
00:44:42.878 --> 00:44:44.818
regardless of whatever that

1098
00:44:44.818 --> 00:44:48.079
chronological time plots may be on paper.

1099
00:44:48.079 --> 00:44:49.949
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1100
00:44:49.949 --> 00:44:53.330
I mean, when I started to really discover this,

1101
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.240
it was just so profound to me

1102
00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.340
and it just made sense.

1103
00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:02.631
And again, when I talked about what I share

1104
00:45:03.521 --> 00:45:06.441
is what comes to me.

1105
00:45:06.441 --> 00:45:07.821
It's me.

1106
00:45:07.821 --> 00:45:10.401
It's in me as it is in you.

1107
00:45:10.401 --> 00:45:12.752
And again, I remind everybody,

1108
00:45:14.632 --> 00:45:16.963
if everything is connected

1109
00:45:16.963 --> 00:45:18.783
like the single cell of a plant

1110
00:45:18.783 --> 00:45:22.123
as it says in the back of my book,

1111
00:45:22.123 --> 00:45:24.843
everything is coded in that cell.

1112
00:45:24.843 --> 00:45:26.943
Everything is encoded in there.

1113
00:45:26.943 --> 00:45:29.003
How can we then,

1114
00:45:29.003 --> 00:45:30.403
how can we not know?

1115
00:45:30.403 --> 00:45:32.263
How can we not have access?

1116
00:45:32.263 --> 00:45:33.964
(indistinct talking)

1117
00:45:33.964 --> 00:45:36.564
<v ->Exactly, it's all there.</v>

1118
00:45:36.564 --> 00:45:37.764
All of the potential,

1119
00:45:37.764 --> 00:45:39.504
all of the possibilities,

1120
00:45:39.504 --> 00:45:40.804
every drop of water,

1121
00:45:40.804 --> 00:45:42.344
everything is us anyway

1122
00:45:42.344 --> 00:45:45.424
so we have to have the history of everything

1123
00:45:45.424 --> 00:45:48.904
but you will not get the full history of everything at once,

1124
00:45:48.904 --> 00:45:51.084
there is no need to do that.

1125
00:45:51.084 --> 00:45:55.344
You will miss out on the excitement of the journey

1126
00:45:55.344 --> 00:45:57.504
of creating and expanding,

1127
00:45:57.504 --> 00:45:59.264
and expanding into yourself

1128
00:45:59.264 --> 00:46:00.584
because that's all that you're doing.

1129
00:46:00.584 --> 00:46:03.335
You're just unfolding into yourself anyway.

1130
00:46:04.325 --> 00:46:05.985
Everything that scientists talked about,

1131
00:46:05.985 --> 00:46:06.845
everything we're looking for,

1132
00:46:06.845 --> 00:46:09.825
all the sub-atomic particles, all of it.

1133
00:46:09.825 --> 00:46:11.885
It's all you.

1134
00:46:11.885 --> 00:46:15.927
And yet, every single particle's a universe on to itself.

1135
00:46:15.927 --> 00:46:18.807
So there is this infinite,

1136
00:46:18.807 --> 00:46:23.807
this endless process of creation that is going on

1137
00:46:24.427 --> 00:46:27.947
way beyond what words could even explain.

1138
00:46:27.947 --> 00:46:28.887
When we say the core,

1139
00:46:28.887 --> 00:46:30.127
we don't even know what,

1140
00:46:30.127 --> 00:46:31.427
is there a core?

1141
00:46:31.427 --> 00:46:35.000
<v Voiceover>Right, Instead, we're choosing to</v>

1142
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.180
limit ourselves to this very systematic march

1143
00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:39.690
toward the grave.

1144
00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:40.837
How incredibly boring,

1145
00:46:40.837 --> 00:46:42.297
if nothing else, it's incredibly boring.

1146
00:46:42.297 --> 00:46:45.588
So that's not working for humanity any longer.

1147
00:46:45.588 --> 00:46:48.308
So let say people are thinking, this is,

1148
00:46:48.308 --> 00:46:51.588
This is intriguing, I don't have to live this way.

1149
00:46:51.588 --> 00:46:54.188
In your book, what is step one?

1150
00:46:54.188 --> 00:46:55.768
If you only give them one step,

1151
00:46:55.768 --> 00:46:56.782
everybody one step,

1152
00:46:56.782 --> 00:46:59.099
what's step one to opening this whole thing up

1153
00:46:59.099 --> 00:47:01.919
and going on to the journey of creativity?

1154
00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:03.419
<v ->That is such a tough one.</v>

1155
00:47:03.419 --> 00:47:05.084
See, you have the top question.

1156
00:47:06.314 --> 00:47:08.834
You asked a tough question because,

1157
00:47:08.834 --> 00:47:10.954
how do I explain this?

1158
00:47:10.954 --> 00:47:14.554
First of all, there has to be a desire.

1159
00:47:14.554 --> 00:47:16.534
That's first and foremost.

1160
00:47:16.534 --> 00:47:18.054
There must be a desire.

1161
00:47:18.054 --> 00:47:20.214
If the desire isn't there, forget it.

1162
00:47:20.214 --> 00:47:23.054
There is commitment, desire and commitment,

1163
00:47:23.054 --> 00:47:24.814
those two things must come together.

1164
00:47:24.814 --> 00:47:26.634
You must have that desire

1165
00:47:26.634 --> 00:47:28.794
and you must be committed.

1166
00:47:28.794 --> 00:47:31.134
You must be committed to knowing,

1167
00:47:31.134 --> 00:47:32.354
not believing,

1168
00:47:32.354 --> 00:47:35.494
you must be committed to knowing.

1169
00:47:35.494 --> 00:47:39.374
And that is, to me, if I can only

1170
00:47:39.374 --> 00:47:42.114
print it down to that, I would have to say those two things

1171
00:47:42.114 --> 00:47:46.194
and know that whatever it is that's gonna unfold to you,

1172
00:47:46.194 --> 00:47:47.294
like I did for myself,

1173
00:47:47.294 --> 00:47:49.314
I wasn't afraid that I would get information

1174
00:47:49.314 --> 00:47:51.871
that would come from, you know, all this,

1175
00:47:51.871 --> 00:47:53.811
no, I didn't think that.

1176
00:47:53.811 --> 00:47:58.159
I just simply said that I desire to know

1177
00:47:59.189 --> 00:48:02.009
and everything that will come to me

1178
00:48:02.009 --> 00:48:04.349
will be in alignment

1179
00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:07.469
with the understanding that I’m seeking.

1180
00:48:07.469 --> 00:48:10.190
That was really basically all I said.

1181
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:11.689
So I didn't need to fear

1182
00:48:11.689 --> 00:48:14.219
that it was gonna come from the dark side,

1183
00:48:14.219 --> 00:48:16.086
there was none of that.

1184
00:48:16.086 --> 00:48:18.266
And I think you come to that space

1185
00:48:18.266 --> 00:48:20.966
and then you gradually develop a trust.

1186
00:48:20.966 --> 00:48:23.226
It takes time to really trust what you're feeling

1187
00:48:23.226 --> 00:48:25.906
and you're seeing, it takes some time.

1188
00:48:25.906 --> 00:48:27.566
Desire, commitment.

1189
00:48:27.566 --> 00:48:28.826
Desire, commitment.

1190
00:48:28.826 --> 00:48:30.546
How strongly do I wanna know this?

1191
00:48:30.546 --> 00:48:32.146
How strongly do I wanna expand?

1192
00:48:32.146 --> 00:48:33.966
How strongly do I wanna be more?

1193
00:48:33.966 --> 00:48:38.966
Life gets easier on one level once you begin to expand

1194
00:48:39.406 --> 00:48:41.726
and once you begin to see more of who you are

1195
00:48:41.726 --> 00:48:43.626
and the fact that everything around you

1196
00:48:43.626 --> 00:48:45.046
is really holographic

1197
00:48:45.046 --> 00:48:48.986
and you're in a giant virtual game created by you

1198
00:48:48.986 --> 00:48:50.946
and it's all frequency patterns.

1199
00:48:50.946 --> 00:48:52.586
This is not fluff stuff, this is science.

1200
00:48:52.586 --> 00:48:54.446
Scientists can tell you that.

1201
00:48:54.446 --> 00:48:56.446
It's all frequency patterns.

1202
00:48:56.446 --> 00:48:57.363
And then you realize--

1203
00:48:57.363 --> 00:48:58.937
<v Voiceover>You don't like it creating your game.</v>

1204
00:48:58.937 --> 00:49:00.357
<v ->Create a new game,</v>

1205
00:49:00.357 --> 00:49:02.197
they're doing that all the time anyway.

1206
00:49:02.197 --> 00:49:03.297
You're creating something new.

1207
00:49:03.297 --> 00:49:05.477
You just create a lot of stuff you don't want.

1208
00:49:05.477 --> 00:49:07.397
You don't really like it,

1209
00:49:07.397 --> 00:49:08.757
but you're creating it anyway.

1210
00:49:08.757 --> 00:49:10.417
So it's recognizing what you create

1211
00:49:10.417 --> 00:49:12.157
and the choices that you make.

1212
00:49:12.157 --> 00:49:14.877
And allow, importantly,

1213
00:49:14.877 --> 00:49:19.437
most importantly, allow others to be who they are

1214
00:49:19.437 --> 00:49:21.697
and focus on your journey.

1215
00:49:21.697 --> 00:49:23.157
When you focus on your journey,

1216
00:49:23.157 --> 00:49:25.777
you'll be amazed that how that person

1217
00:49:25.777 --> 00:49:28.257
will be a completely different individual

1218
00:49:28.257 --> 00:49:29.937
than what when you're focused on

1219
00:49:29.937 --> 00:49:31.737
what you don't like about that person

1220
00:49:31.737 --> 00:49:35.197
and I've seen it happened so many times in my own space.

1221
00:49:35.197 --> 00:49:36.517
Change my perception.

1222
00:49:36.517 --> 00:49:39.777
I think that person changes but my perception has changed,

1223
00:49:39.777 --> 00:49:41.934
and that person no longer needs to be

1224
00:49:41.934 --> 00:49:43.054
what I thought they were.

1225
00:49:43.054 --> 00:49:44.688
<v Voiceover>Yeah, you're not walking them into</v>

1226
00:49:44.688 --> 00:49:46.448
that virtual reality

1227
00:49:46.448 --> 00:49:47.767
in terms of your part--

1228
00:49:47.767 --> 00:49:49.878
<v ->Right, yeah.</v>

1229
00:49:49.878 --> 00:49:52.456
<v Voiceover>Any final thoughts?</v>

1230
00:49:52.456 --> 00:49:55.355
<v ->Any final thoughts is,</v>

1231
00:49:55.355 --> 00:49:57.315
the journey is fascinating.

1232
00:49:57.315 --> 00:49:58.595
It's a beautiful game.

1233
00:49:58.595 --> 00:50:01.675
It's a massive cosmic game.

1234
00:50:01.675 --> 00:50:04.255
Understand that you're in a game and it's very big

1235
00:50:04.255 --> 00:50:06.215
and there's lot of other games in it

1236
00:50:06.215 --> 00:50:09.015
and you have the opportunity to choose now

1237
00:50:09.015 --> 00:50:10.115
how you wanna play it.

1238
00:50:10.115 --> 00:50:11.855
You did choose how you wanted to play it,

1239
00:50:11.855 --> 00:50:13.255
but you forgot.

1240
00:50:13.255 --> 00:50:15.336
So now you're remembering that you chose,

1241
00:50:15.336 --> 00:50:17.035
now you can make different choices

1242
00:50:17.035 --> 00:50:20.795
so you can be a more expansive game player

1243
00:50:20.795 --> 00:50:21.962
and a creator.

1244
00:50:23.872 --> 00:50:26.112
<v ->If you'd like to become more familiar with Sonia's work,</v>

1245
00:50:26.112 --> 00:50:28.662
you can pick up a copy of the holographic canvass

1246
00:50:28.662 --> 00:50:31.049
through Amazon or other major book sellers.

1247
00:50:31.049 --> 00:50:32.029
Until next time.

1248
00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:33.747
Thanks for watching CMN.

1249
00:50:33.747 --> 00:50:38.696
(gentle music)
