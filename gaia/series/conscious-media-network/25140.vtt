00:00:00.771 --> 00:00:04.401
(mellow instrumental music)

2
00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:14.671
<v ->As the world of medicine becomes more burdened</v>

3
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:15.712
by the moment,

4
00:00:15.712 --> 00:00:17.872
it's good to know a skilled medical intuitive

5
00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:19.912
to get the straight scoop on what ails you

6
00:00:19.912 --> 00:00:21.472
and where it came from.

7
00:00:21.472 --> 00:00:23.171
One of the top intuitives in this department

8
00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:24.671
is Laura Alden Kamm

9
00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:27.892
who many doctors call the walking MRI.

10
00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:30.343
Laura can see the causal effect of disease,

11
00:00:30.343 --> 00:00:31.742
right down to your thoughts,

12
00:00:31.742 --> 00:00:34.313
bacteria, even past-life influences.

13
00:00:34.482 --> 00:00:36.522
One of her areas of interest is heart health.

14
00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:39.722
She says that heart disease is particularly fascinating

15
00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:42.482
as it's a considerably more complex mechanism

16
00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:44.683
than medicine understands at this time.

17
00:00:44.713 --> 00:00:47.333
Giving much greater weight to the old adage

18
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.163
the heart knows the way.

19
00:00:57.293 --> 00:01:00.054
Laura, we've interviewed a lot of people

20
00:01:00.054 --> 00:01:03.274
and often times there's a very dramatic kind of experience

21
00:01:03.274 --> 00:01:05.014
that happens in the lives of people

22
00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:06.954
that just cracks them wide open.

23
00:01:06.954 --> 00:01:09.514
This is really the journey you took.

24
00:01:09.514 --> 00:01:11.314
What happened to you when you were very young

25
00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:14.384
that led you to blindness and even death.

26
00:01:14.694 --> 00:01:17.094
<v ->Yes, yes, I was minding my own business,</v>

27
00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:20.124
I had a perfect plan for my life.

28
00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:22.394
I was going to be an architect,

29
00:01:22.394 --> 00:01:24.834
I was back in school at Indiana State, married,

30
00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:28.524
two adorable toddlers, two and three years old.

31
00:01:28.894 --> 00:01:31.234
I was gonna create fabulous buildings

32
00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:34.314
so that the people that really occupied the building

33
00:01:34.314 --> 00:01:36.154
and their energy and essence

34
00:01:36.154 --> 00:01:37.825
could be expressed through that.

35
00:01:38.394 --> 00:01:43.394
However, I woke up on Super Bowl Sunday, 1982,

36
00:01:45.194 --> 00:01:48.414
and I had the most mind searing pain in my head

37
00:01:48.414 --> 00:01:50.604
and it just gripped me.

38
00:01:51.554 --> 00:01:55.654
11 days later, I was totally blind and I died

39
00:01:55.654 --> 00:01:59.084
going from one hospital to another in an ambulance.

40
00:01:59.514 --> 00:02:03.615
I remember floating over this young woman's body

41
00:02:03.615 --> 00:02:07.864
and my mother was there and a nurse was there.

42
00:02:10.194 --> 00:02:14.644
I remember my mother holding my hand in prayer

43
00:02:15.495 --> 00:02:18.015
and the nurse was leaning into my body,

44
00:02:18.015 --> 00:02:21.125
pressing into it and she was saying, "Laura, don't go."

45
00:02:21.576 --> 00:02:24.865
That's the first time I recognized that was me.

46
00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:31.405
Then she said to my mom, "I'm sorry, we've lost her."

47
00:02:32.655 --> 00:02:36.337
I remember this amazing

48
00:02:37.106 --> 00:02:39.817
love and peace that,

49
00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:46.326
it's hard to put it into words cause I didn't have a body.

50
00:02:46.326 --> 00:02:48.138
My body was there on a gurney,

51
00:02:48.138 --> 00:02:52.988
but it filled my consciousness, it filled my mother,

52
00:02:53.158 --> 00:02:54.238
it filled the nurse,

53
00:02:54.238 --> 00:02:56.569
it filled that body that was mine, there.

54
00:02:56.638 --> 00:02:57.978
It filled every space

55
00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:01.359
that I could even get my consciousness around

56
00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.778
and it was just love and peace

57
00:03:03.778 --> 00:03:05.868
and I knew everything would be fine,

58
00:03:06.198 --> 00:03:07.908
and I was outa there.

59
00:03:08.358 --> 00:03:10.948
It really is a white tunnel, it really is.

60
00:03:11.278 --> 00:03:14.988
For me it was rather a large and layered,

61
00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:17.799
there were others in there with me,

62
00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.498
some going really quickly.

63
00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:20.958
<v Voiceover>Oh really, now that's the first person</v>

64
00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.698
I've heard that the person wasn't having

65
00:03:22.698 --> 00:03:25.298
a singular experience, others were with you

66
00:03:25.298 --> 00:03:26.758
and you were all zipping along?

67
00:03:26.758 --> 00:03:28.599
<v ->It was like a freeway,
(laughing)

68
00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.738
and they were different colors and hues

69
00:03:30.738 --> 00:03:34.808
and they didn't have bodies, but they had a body like shape.

70
00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.248
Some were more, excuse me,

71
00:03:38.658 --> 00:03:43.288
some were more opalescent in color and just exquisite

72
00:03:43.458 --> 00:03:44.658
and some were standing there

73
00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:46.018
as if they didn't know where they were,

74
00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:47.079
what they wanted to do

75
00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.598
and some were just flying by me

76
00:03:48.598 --> 00:03:51.338
and I seemed to go at a fairly quick pace

77
00:03:51.338 --> 00:03:53.348
because it was a compelling pull.

78
00:03:53.738 --> 00:03:55.738
You couldn't stop it, I couldn't stop it,

79
00:03:55.738 --> 00:03:57.468
I had to go, I had to go.

80
00:03:57.738 --> 00:04:00.478
When I reached what seemed to be the culmination

81
00:04:00.478 --> 00:04:02.658
of that point it was like I fell into a lake

82
00:04:02.658 --> 00:04:04.378
in Minnesota in the winter.

83
00:04:04.378 --> 00:04:06.418
If I would have had a body

84
00:04:06.418 --> 00:04:07.898
it would have taken my breath away

85
00:04:07.898 --> 00:04:11.148
and it was all light and blinding light,

86
00:04:11.658 --> 00:04:15.010
kind of like the light you see reflected off a chrome bumper

87
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.450
with the sunlight, it was blinding light.

88
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:23.230
It was all love and I knew I was there,

89
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.263
I thought at times I still had a body

90
00:04:25.263 --> 00:04:27.443
because I remember this one instance

91
00:04:27.443 --> 00:04:30.023
where I tried to look down and see my feet,

92
00:04:30.023 --> 00:04:31.444
that was my thought

93
00:04:31.444 --> 00:04:33.063
and of course that didn't go anywhere

94
00:04:33.063 --> 00:04:36.124
and everything is foggy, everything's in the light

95
00:04:36.124 --> 00:04:38.343
and then I heard these subtle whispers

96
00:04:38.343 --> 00:04:39.803
of voices around me

97
00:04:39.803 --> 00:04:43.523
and they didn't say my name but I knew they were calling me,

98
00:04:43.523 --> 00:04:45.183
in some way, shape or form.

99
00:04:45.183 --> 00:04:47.303
I gradually, gradually kind of woke up,

100
00:04:47.303 --> 00:04:51.183
my spiritual eyes and my spiritual ears to hear them

101
00:04:51.183 --> 00:04:54.853
and it was exquisite, it was extraordinary.

102
00:04:55.063 --> 00:04:56.223
<v Voiceover>Do you remember any</v>

103
00:04:56.223 --> 00:04:57.683
of what you were being told?

104
00:04:57.683 --> 00:05:01.863
<v ->I do, in part, and the interesting thing about my journey</v>

105
00:05:01.863 --> 00:05:05.003
since then is that I know I was taught

106
00:05:05.003 --> 00:05:07.923
a lot about intuition, a lot about healing,

107
00:05:07.923 --> 00:05:09.613
a lot about energy.

108
00:05:09.863 --> 00:05:13.793
As I moved past these and through these past 30 years

109
00:05:14.543 --> 00:05:18.163
it has come up in different situations and scenarios,

110
00:05:18.163 --> 00:05:20.303
it's much more powerful than a deja vu

111
00:05:20.303 --> 00:05:24.733
because it's a solid, remembering of streams of information.

112
00:05:24.943 --> 00:05:27.443
Actually volumes of information, sometimes

113
00:05:27.443 --> 00:05:32.273
and I was taught by a group that I call the wisdom keepers

114
00:05:32.383 --> 00:05:34.323
because that's what they told me they were

115
00:05:34.323 --> 00:05:35.523
and they took me into a room,

116
00:05:35.523 --> 00:05:38.683
I saw my life, I saw this one situation

117
00:05:38.683 --> 00:05:40.323
when I was five years old

118
00:05:40.323 --> 00:05:42.783
and I always wanted a baby robin as a pet

119
00:05:42.783 --> 00:05:44.763
and I talked my best friend, Sue,

120
00:05:44.763 --> 00:05:48.063
into stealing a robin's egg with me

121
00:05:48.063 --> 00:05:50.223
and we snatched one and we ran back to her backyard

122
00:05:50.223 --> 00:05:52.703
and we picked the little shell open,

123
00:05:52.703 --> 00:05:54.283
course the bird was dead

124
00:05:54.283 --> 00:05:56.743
and that was my first experience

125
00:05:56.743 --> 00:06:01.373
of really feeling interconnectedness with earthly things.

126
00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:05.213
I felt the mother robin's pain, I felt my pain,

127
00:06:05.263 --> 00:06:09.553
I felt Sue's pain and of course the little baby bird,

128
00:06:09.663 --> 00:06:10.943
I felt that anguish too

129
00:06:10.943 --> 00:06:13.663
and I felt so horrible that I had killed that bird

130
00:06:13.663 --> 00:06:15.343
and ended that life.

131
00:06:15.343 --> 00:06:20.093
That settled deep within some part of my consciousness

132
00:06:20.143 --> 00:06:21.563
and I'll never forget that

133
00:06:21.563 --> 00:06:24.543
and when I look at people or birds or anything today,

134
00:06:24.543 --> 00:06:27.863
you know that resonance that we all have with one another

135
00:06:27.863 --> 00:06:30.073
is certainly there, very profound.

136
00:06:31.323 --> 00:06:33.443
I watched a lot of different things go on,

137
00:06:33.443 --> 00:06:37.293
I remember right at the end of that situation

138
00:06:37.293 --> 00:06:42.293
where I felt this enormously large male presence behind me

139
00:06:43.203 --> 00:06:45.184
and there was something inside of me

140
00:06:45.184 --> 00:06:46.904
that was to afraid to look around

141
00:06:46.904 --> 00:06:49.794
as if I had a body to turn, of course, but I didn't.

142
00:06:51.405 --> 00:06:55.505
I couldn't face it directly, I couldn't go face-to-face

143
00:06:55.505 --> 00:06:57.495
so to speak with this energy.

144
00:06:57.605 --> 00:06:59.725
But it was so compassionate, it was just so big

145
00:06:59.725 --> 00:07:01.495
I couldn't handle it almost.

146
00:07:02.165 --> 00:07:03.305
And I heard this voice say,

147
00:07:03.305 --> 00:07:07.375
"Laura, you can stay, but I really need you to go home."

148
00:07:07.805 --> 00:07:09.105
And with that I woke up,

149
00:07:09.105 --> 00:07:12.745
I heard a lovely soft woman's voice saying,

150
00:07:12.745 --> 00:07:14.485
"Do you know your name?

151
00:07:14.485 --> 00:07:16.485
"Do you know what day it is?

152
00:07:16.485 --> 00:07:18.345
"Do you know who the president is?"

153
00:07:18.345 --> 00:07:22.225
And I woke up even more and there was a lovely angel

154
00:07:22.225 --> 00:07:25.375
standing next to me, cleverly disguised as an ICU nurse.

155
00:07:25.405 --> 00:07:28.345
She was so sweet and I came out of the coma

156
00:07:28.345 --> 00:07:31.096
and I came back from the near-death experience.

157
00:07:33.045 --> 00:07:34.245
<v Voiceover>There is something else</v>

158
00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.925
that I was reading about that you heard

159
00:07:36.925 --> 00:07:38.646
and at what point did you hear this

160
00:07:38.646 --> 00:07:40.705
because I thought it was very interesting.

161
00:07:40.705 --> 00:07:44.105
It said it will be 100 years before science understands

162
00:07:44.105 --> 00:07:46.195
what happened to you.

163
00:07:46.285 --> 00:07:50.225
<v ->That was actually my doctor, my neurosurgeon told me that.</v>

164
00:07:50.225 --> 00:07:51.345
<v Voiceover>Oh, I see.</v>

165
00:07:51.345 --> 00:07:52.945
<v ->They didn't know what was wrong with me</v>

166
00:07:52.945 --> 00:07:54.846
and it turned out I had brain abscesses

167
00:07:54.846 --> 00:07:58.686
and spinal meningitis and that's what caused the blindness

168
00:07:58.686 --> 00:08:00.545
cause it was in the right occipital lobe

169
00:08:00.545 --> 00:08:03.025
and when I came out of the coma and still to this day,

170
00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:05.955
I'm blind in the left visual field in both eyes.

171
00:08:05.965 --> 00:08:07.145
I could donate my eyes

172
00:08:07.145 --> 00:08:08.965
and somebody would need reading glasses,

173
00:08:08.965 --> 00:08:10.365
you know and that's it.

174
00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:12.325
But other than that it's in the brain cells

175
00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:16.875
and I've lived more years this way than I have fully sighted

176
00:08:16.885 --> 00:08:18.225
so it doesn't bother me.

177
00:08:18.225 --> 00:08:20.445
Besides what happens to me now

178
00:08:20.445 --> 00:08:23.805
is that I see all these colors and particles.

179
00:08:23.805 --> 00:08:27.136
I get to see the quantum world, physically,

180
00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:29.445
because of the blindness and it's great.

181
00:08:29.445 --> 00:08:30.585
<v Voiceover>I was gonna ask you,</v>

182
00:08:30.585 --> 00:08:32.465
cause that had to be the opening of your real vision.

183
00:08:32.465 --> 00:08:34.985
<v ->It is, although I did have some experiences</v>

184
00:08:34.985 --> 00:08:37.745
that were extraordinarily powerful when I was a young girl

185
00:08:37.745 --> 00:08:39.645
all the way up through 16,

186
00:08:39.645 --> 00:08:41.745
where I had a Fatima like experience

187
00:08:41.745 --> 00:08:44.325
with another young woman that I'd just met.

188
00:08:44.325 --> 00:08:48.366
We had three Saints visit us

189
00:08:48.366 --> 00:08:50.945
when we were walking around a college campus in Ohio

190
00:08:50.945 --> 00:08:53.315
and we were paralyzed we couldn't move.

191
00:08:53.745 --> 00:08:56.965
The response when we shared this with people,

192
00:08:56.965 --> 00:08:58.285
cause we were terrified,

193
00:08:58.285 --> 00:09:01.755
when we finally were released, so to speak,

194
00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:03.895
and to go find my father

195
00:09:03.985 --> 00:09:06.095
who's a Presbyterian minister by the way.

196
00:09:06.185 --> 00:09:09.265
But he also taught me tai chi and yoga,

197
00:09:09.265 --> 00:09:11.795
so he's not your average minister.

198
00:09:14.385 --> 00:09:17.635
The people's response to that really scared us even more.

199
00:09:18.385 --> 00:09:20.465
Some people didn't believe us, of course,

200
00:09:20.465 --> 00:09:23.005
others were afraid of us, others were angry

201
00:09:23.005 --> 00:09:25.165
because they'd been praying their whole life

202
00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:28.255
and why should these two young girls have this experience.

203
00:09:29.325 --> 00:09:32.405
Then when I went home to my small hometown in Ohio

204
00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:35.885
it got even stranger and people started praying around me,

205
00:09:35.885 --> 00:09:38.305
and speaking tongues, totally frightened me

206
00:09:38.305 --> 00:09:40.085
and I just shut everything down.

207
00:09:40.085 --> 00:09:43.655
Then at 26 this near-death experience came

208
00:09:43.825 --> 00:09:45.745
and opened everything back up

209
00:09:45.745 --> 00:09:47.705
and it's like the cowardly lion going,

210
00:09:47.705 --> 00:09:49.105
"I do believe, I do believe."

211
00:09:49.105 --> 00:09:51.065
You know, I'm not gonna shut it down anymore

212
00:09:51.065 --> 00:09:53.085
and then it's just progressed from there

213
00:09:53.085 --> 00:09:57.085
with, you know, you get nervous when your world changes

214
00:09:57.085 --> 00:10:01.375
this fast and in such a large way

215
00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:04.095
and yet you keep going.

216
00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:05.625
<v Voiceover>How long did it take</v>

217
00:10:05.625 --> 00:10:09.015
before you actually started utilizing this sight?

218
00:10:09.545 --> 00:10:12.065
For your work, for your mission in life,

219
00:10:12.065 --> 00:10:15.255
everyday life and so forth, when you blasted it open?

220
00:10:15.445 --> 00:10:17.325
<v ->It took about eight years, actually,</v>

221
00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:19.985
before I really kind of let the cat out of the bag,

222
00:10:19.985 --> 00:10:21.005
so to speak.

223
00:10:21.005 --> 00:10:23.985
Even though I was exploring it and trying to figure it out

224
00:10:23.985 --> 00:10:25.765
and it was to go back to your question

225
00:10:25.765 --> 00:10:28.125
the doctor that told me about this

226
00:10:28.125 --> 00:10:29.985
because the day before I went blind

227
00:10:29.985 --> 00:10:33.395
and prior to that I was terrified.

228
00:10:33.485 --> 00:10:34.725
I didn't want to leave my children,

229
00:10:34.725 --> 00:10:37.545
I was afraid of falling asleep when I was in the hospital

230
00:10:37.545 --> 00:10:38.965
cause I didn't think I'd wake up.

231
00:10:38.965 --> 00:10:41.025
The doctors knew I was dying, we didn't know why,

232
00:10:41.025 --> 00:10:42.545
we all knew I was dying.

233
00:10:42.545 --> 00:10:45.085
But that afternoon, before I went blind,

234
00:10:45.085 --> 00:10:49.125
I started to see colors and particles lift off my body

235
00:10:49.125 --> 00:10:51.805
and my body became very heavy

236
00:10:51.805 --> 00:10:54.705
and I knew that was my soul going home

237
00:10:54.705 --> 00:10:58.285
and a peace came over me, again that lovely peace

238
00:10:59.835 --> 00:11:03.925
of serenity that I knew everything would just be fine.

239
00:11:03.925 --> 00:11:05.405
I was just going home.

240
00:11:05.405 --> 00:11:07.865
And so that started again, that visual anomaly,

241
00:11:07.865 --> 00:11:12.865
started again and I actually thought I was gonna die again

242
00:11:13.165 --> 00:11:15.305
so I ran back to the neurosurgeon at that time

243
00:11:15.305 --> 00:11:17.285
and he checked me out and he said, "You're fine."

244
00:11:17.285 --> 00:11:19.965
He came around his desk, he sat down on his desk

245
00:11:19.965 --> 00:11:22.446
and he said, "Laura, it's gonna be a 100 years

246
00:11:22.446 --> 00:11:24.805
"before Western science can ever figure out

247
00:11:24.805 --> 00:11:27.506
"what happened to your brain, just do the best you can.

248
00:11:27.506 --> 00:11:29.085
"You've got a second chance at life,

249
00:11:29.085 --> 00:11:31.695
"go live your life, do what your here to do."

250
00:11:31.885 --> 00:11:33.305
<v ->{Voiceover] Oh and boy are you.</v>

251
00:11:33.305 --> 00:11:34.145
<v ->Pardon me?</v>

252
00:11:34.145 --> 00:11:35.865
<v ->{Voiceover] Boy are you doing what you're here to do.</v>

253
00:11:35.865 --> 00:11:37.205
<v ->Yes, oh yes, no choice.</v>

254
00:11:37.205 --> 00:11:39.525
<v ->{Voiceover] No choice, well bring it up to modern times</v>

255
00:11:39.525 --> 00:11:42.425
and now you are spending your life,

256
00:11:42.425 --> 00:11:45.825
you're dedicated to helping humanity understand

257
00:11:45.825 --> 00:11:49.835
that every person has the ability to unlock

258
00:11:50.016 --> 00:11:51.516
their intuitive powers.

259
00:11:51.516 --> 00:11:54.466
<v ->Yes, without a crisis, without a crisis</v>

260
00:11:54.656 --> 00:11:56.596
and I think this time in our lives

261
00:11:56.596 --> 00:12:00.036
we're at this place where science and quantum physics,

262
00:12:00.036 --> 00:12:02.016
even though I'm not a physicist,

263
00:12:02.016 --> 00:12:03.716
I don't study it that deeply,

264
00:12:03.716 --> 00:12:06.036
but what I have studied of it,

265
00:12:06.036 --> 00:12:10.346
it matches what I have experienced for these 30 years

266
00:12:10.456 --> 00:12:14.016
and it matches the experiences I had as a child too.

267
00:12:14.016 --> 00:12:15.856
So it's starting to bridge the gap,

268
00:12:15.856 --> 00:12:19.296
you know in the sixth century there was an island in Greece,

269
00:12:19.296 --> 00:12:22.637
called Samos, S-A-M-O-S, and they had a problem,

270
00:12:22.637 --> 00:12:24.677
they had to get water from one side of the mountain

271
00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:26.036
down to the village.

272
00:12:26.036 --> 00:12:27.736
What they did is they dug tunnels

273
00:12:27.736 --> 00:12:29.576
coming from both opposing ends.

274
00:12:29.576 --> 00:12:32.146
It took them eight years and they met in the middle,

275
00:12:32.176 --> 00:12:33.856
only 60 centimeters apart

276
00:12:33.856 --> 00:12:35.296
<v Voiceover>Amazing.</v>

277
00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.856
and I think that's where we are right now.

278
00:12:36.856 --> 00:12:38.717
You know we're meeting, spirituality,

279
00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:41.916
which sages have known forever and mystics have known

280
00:12:41.916 --> 00:12:44.597
and people on a spiritual path have known,

281
00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:47.496
it's coming together with what science is showing us

282
00:12:47.496 --> 00:12:49.666
and that's exciting, it's time.

283
00:12:50.117 --> 00:12:51.636
<v Voiceover>And you talk about it</v>

284
00:12:51.636 --> 00:12:53.597
in terms of intuitive wellness.

285
00:12:53.597 --> 00:12:57.726
I've not heard that phrase together before.

286
00:12:58.056 --> 00:13:00.087
Intuitive wellness, what does that mean?

287
00:13:00.207 --> 00:13:02.447
Before we start diving into what you actually do.

288
00:13:02.447 --> 00:13:04.507
<v ->Well, I think everybody has the capacity</v>

289
00:13:04.507 --> 00:13:07.687
to use their intuition, which we all have of course,

290
00:13:07.687 --> 00:13:10.627
to assess anything that they want in life

291
00:13:10.627 --> 00:13:12.277
including their wellness.

292
00:13:12.407 --> 00:13:15.907
Diseases all have attitudes, conditions all have attitudes

293
00:13:16.657 --> 00:13:21.367
and it's up to us to take a look at

294
00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:23.627
what's going on with ourselves.

295
00:13:23.627 --> 00:13:26.189
It has to do with fitness, of course,

296
00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:29.568
but it has to do with quality of life and who you are

297
00:13:29.568 --> 00:13:32.208
all wrapped up in the totality of who you are

298
00:13:32.208 --> 00:13:34.868
because we're all different, we're all very unique

299
00:13:34.868 --> 00:13:37.538
and yet we all have this gift to be able to do this.

300
00:13:37.808 --> 00:13:41.588
And wellness, when I do my work and part of this model,

301
00:13:41.588 --> 00:13:45.629
it's spiritual, emotional, energetic and physical,

302
00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:47.578
it's not just about physical.

303
00:13:47.808 --> 00:13:50.028
<v Voiceover>And you're able to, in most cases,</v>

304
00:13:50.028 --> 00:13:51.888
get people opened up to a point

305
00:13:51.888 --> 00:13:54.738
where they can start accessing their intuitive side.

306
00:13:54.848 --> 00:13:56.828
<v ->Yes, and that's the fun thing--</v>

307
00:13:56.828 --> 00:13:57.928
<v Voiceover>It's wonderful.</v>

308
00:13:57.928 --> 00:13:59.648
<v ->Because I came back from that near-death experience</v>

309
00:13:59.648 --> 00:14:01.428
with a couple of really great tools

310
00:14:01.428 --> 00:14:04.548
given to me from the other side and they're very simple

311
00:14:04.548 --> 00:14:06.928
and they're very familiar to a lot of people.

312
00:14:06.928 --> 00:14:08.508
I don't know what it is,

313
00:14:08.508 --> 00:14:12.038
they seem to be charged with something.

314
00:14:12.228 --> 00:14:14.908
I don't want to sound too strange or specialized,

315
00:14:14.908 --> 00:14:17.968
but they're different in some way, shape or form

316
00:14:17.968 --> 00:14:20.538
that the people do these exercises.

317
00:14:20.548 --> 00:14:23.088
And I think it's also timing right now,

318
00:14:23.088 --> 00:14:24.728
people are just ready for this.

319
00:14:24.728 --> 00:14:27.568
It's not maybe that the exercise is so special

320
00:14:27.568 --> 00:14:30.508
it's just that the timing and the person is ready

321
00:14:30.508 --> 00:14:32.358
and it just opens them up.

322
00:14:32.588 --> 00:14:35.528
<v Voiceover>You mentioned earlier, speaking of tools,</v>

323
00:14:35.528 --> 00:14:39.868
that you saw the color coming off of your body and such.

324
00:14:39.868 --> 00:14:42.128
Let's talk about colors and intuition,

325
00:14:42.128 --> 00:14:44.608
because this is something we all interface with,

326
00:14:44.608 --> 00:14:47.558
well almost everyone interfaces with every day.

327
00:14:47.708 --> 00:14:50.248
<v ->Yeah well again, conditions in the body,</v>

328
00:14:50.248 --> 00:14:53.088
in the electromagnetic field, emotions, thoughts,

329
00:14:53.088 --> 00:14:56.208
memories, anything that you want to create in your life,

330
00:14:56.208 --> 00:14:58.198
it all has a certain frequency.

331
00:14:58.408 --> 00:15:00.828
Because I believe from my experience

332
00:15:00.828 --> 00:15:04.728
it's a consciousness world, it's built on consciousness

333
00:15:04.728 --> 00:15:06.868
and energy is a by-product of that

334
00:15:06.868 --> 00:15:08.748
and then frequency comes from energy

335
00:15:08.748 --> 00:15:10.948
and different frequencies have different colors

336
00:15:10.948 --> 00:15:12.828
and hues associated with them.

337
00:15:12.828 --> 00:15:14.788
The colors I'm talking about, you know,

338
00:15:14.788 --> 00:15:18.128
Crayola crayons 64 pack hasn't even matched these yet

339
00:15:18.128 --> 00:15:20.268
and so there really aren't any names,

340
00:15:20.268 --> 00:15:23.928
but you can still experience the myriad of beautiful colors

341
00:15:23.928 --> 00:15:25.558
that come off of this.

342
00:15:25.588 --> 00:15:29.068
Now the fun thing to do is when you sense these colors

343
00:15:29.068 --> 00:15:31.068
and you can feel, here, see and know

344
00:15:31.068 --> 00:15:34.568
as many already understand that about intuition.

345
00:15:34.568 --> 00:15:38.068
You can place your minds attention in and around that color

346
00:15:38.068 --> 00:15:40.858
and extrapolate the data that's in there.

347
00:15:40.868 --> 00:15:42.788
That's where you get this information

348
00:15:42.788 --> 00:15:47.629
that is just teaming with vitality of direction, of clarity.

349
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:49.768
Whenever you feel lost, all you need to do

350
00:15:49.768 --> 00:15:52.309
is go inside, turn on that intuition

351
00:15:52.309 --> 00:15:54.908
and place your mind in strategic places

352
00:15:54.908 --> 00:15:58.098
and you'll get your answers every single time.

353
00:15:58.648 --> 00:16:01.848
<v Voiceover>And so this isn't classic color therapy,</v>

354
00:16:01.848 --> 00:16:04.368
by any means, this is really drawing on color

355
00:16:04.368 --> 00:16:06.568
from a completely different place.

356
00:16:06.568 --> 00:16:07.608
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

357
00:16:07.608 --> 00:16:11.308
<v Voiceover>Have you noticed certain corollaries</v>

358
00:16:11.308 --> 00:16:14.348
between certain colors and certain mental states

359
00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:16.168
or conditions and so forth?

360
00:16:16.168 --> 00:16:18.868
<v ->Well I think the Chakra system from Ayurvedic medicine</v>

361
00:16:18.868 --> 00:16:20.728
follows that pretty well

362
00:16:20.728 --> 00:16:24.628
and so that's a really good launch model to hold onto.

363
00:16:24.628 --> 00:16:27.538
Red, usually does mean survival issues.

364
00:16:27.648 --> 00:16:30.748
Take for example, I flew out of Orlando, Florida,

365
00:16:30.748 --> 00:16:33.388
to come here this weekend

366
00:16:33.388 --> 00:16:37.789
and we have quite a cold snap going on in Florida

367
00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:40.069
where we almost didn't make it out

368
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:41.968
between the ice on the wing

369
00:16:41.968 --> 00:16:44.328
and the snow potential in Florida.

370
00:16:44.328 --> 00:16:45.288
<v Voiceover>In Florida?</v>

371
00:16:45.288 --> 00:16:46.608
<v ->In Florida, and there's no de-icing--</v>

372
00:16:46.608 --> 00:16:47.648
<v Voiceover>This is crazy.</v>

373
00:16:47.648 --> 00:16:50.268
<v ->Yes, yes the sun is the de-icing equipment there</v>

374
00:16:50.268 --> 00:16:52.328
so we had this very narrow window

375
00:16:52.328 --> 00:16:54.448
and a pilot steps out of the cockpit

376
00:16:54.448 --> 00:16:55.908
to get his cup of coffee

377
00:16:55.908 --> 00:16:59.439
and everything around his whole body was this vibrant red,

378
00:16:59.439 --> 00:17:02.619
reddish-orange, you know that which you'd typically see

379
00:17:02.619 --> 00:17:05.199
in the first Chakra zone which is lower in the body

380
00:17:05.199 --> 00:17:07.939
was all over the upper part of his body.

381
00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:09.019
<v Voiceover>We're talking survival,</v>

382
00:17:09.019 --> 00:17:10.479
responsibility for all these people.

383
00:17:10.479 --> 00:17:14.909
<v ->Absolutely, absolutely, so within in that,</v>

384
00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:17.119
you can take that model for his Chakra

385
00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:21.259
all that red and sun-- oh that's a tough one,

386
00:17:21.259 --> 00:17:24.979
all that red and sunset orange that's in his field

387
00:17:24.979 --> 00:17:27.019
and I just put my mind in there

388
00:17:27.019 --> 00:17:29.919
to look around a little bit

389
00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:32.359
and I was actually checking his skill sets,

390
00:17:32.359 --> 00:17:34.999
I was checking his comfort with the plane

391
00:17:34.999 --> 00:17:36.439
because it was a brand-new plane.

392
00:17:36.439 --> 00:17:38.379
I think it'd only been in service nine days,

393
00:17:38.379 --> 00:17:41.119
so I wanted to check just to see where things are

394
00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:42.859
and my intuition said we're gonna be fine,

395
00:17:42.859 --> 00:17:43.999
we're gonna be fine,

396
00:17:43.999 --> 00:17:45.419
but the person sitting next to me

397
00:17:45.419 --> 00:17:46.819
was already white-knuckled,

398
00:17:46.819 --> 00:17:49.139
you know, but I knew we were gonna be fine

399
00:17:49.139 --> 00:17:50.969
and we were, obviously I'm here.

400
00:17:50.979 --> 00:17:53.659
<v Voiceover>Yes and thank you for that,</v>

401
00:17:53.659 --> 00:17:55.379
thank you for trusting in yourself.

402
00:17:55.379 --> 00:17:56.619
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

403
00:17:56.619 --> 00:17:58.699
<v Voiceover>What about some of the higher octaves</v>

404
00:17:58.699 --> 00:18:00.349
of color, for example?

405
00:18:00.419 --> 00:18:01.859
I mean, years ago I read every book

406
00:18:01.859 --> 00:18:03.559
there was on color that I could find

407
00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:06.079
and used to do little lectures on color therapy.

408
00:18:06.079 --> 00:18:09.179
We're talking 25 years ago, easily,

409
00:18:09.179 --> 00:18:12.059
but that was classic stuff,

410
00:18:12.059 --> 00:18:16.519
but there are octaves that we see in our minds eye

411
00:18:16.519 --> 00:18:18.960
or in meditation that are far beyond that,

412
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.459
so much more sublime.

413
00:18:20.459 --> 00:18:23.319
Do you work with people

414
00:18:23.319 --> 00:18:26.349
with these really sublime kind of frequencies?

415
00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:28.419
I mean, for example, one that I just love

416
00:18:28.419 --> 00:18:31.779
is a soft rose infused with metallic gold,

417
00:18:31.779 --> 00:18:36.649
gold like an iridescent golden-rose color.

418
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.139
<v ->Beautiful.</v>

419
00:18:38.139 --> 00:18:39.419
<v Voiceover>And that kind of thing,</v>

420
00:18:39.419 --> 00:18:41.259
do you work with people in those ranges?

421
00:18:41.259 --> 00:18:44.679
<v ->Always and it depends on what the person needs,</v>

422
00:18:44.679 --> 00:18:47.539
what that body needs in the moment

423
00:18:47.539 --> 00:18:49.709
or what their heart needs.

424
00:18:49.839 --> 00:18:53.779
All you need to do is call in and ask simple questions

425
00:18:53.779 --> 00:18:57.499
via your intuition in order to understand what they need

426
00:18:57.499 --> 00:19:00.079
and those types of colors, those higher frequencies,

427
00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:05.079
will come in and I don't tend to rely on one specific color,

428
00:19:05.699 --> 00:19:07.819
except for myself, because I know--

429
00:19:07.819 --> 00:19:09.899
<v Voiceover>You have your kind of keynote color?</v>

430
00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:10.819
<v ->I do.</v>

431
00:19:10.819 --> 00:19:12.599
<v Voiceover>What's that, do you care to share?</v>

432
00:19:12.599 --> 00:19:14.319
<v ->The only way I can describe it</v>

433
00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:16.460
is it's close to a periwinkle blue

434
00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:21.199
and some opalescent colors like a fire-opal from Australia

435
00:19:21.199 --> 00:19:23.139
and throw a little pixie dust in it.

436
00:19:23.139 --> 00:19:24.159
<v Voiceover>Oh that's beautiful.</v>

437
00:19:24.159 --> 00:19:25.559
<v ->There you go, that's me those are my colors.</v>

438
00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:30.140
That's what I use whenever I need to pull that in

439
00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.060
a little bit more into my own awareness.

440
00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.119
It's always there,

441
00:19:33.119 --> 00:19:35.219
but it's about pulling it into your awareness.

442
00:19:35.219 --> 00:19:38.979
<v Voiceover>So this acts, sort of, as a path</v>

443
00:19:38.979 --> 00:19:42.559
or conduit between your conscious mind,

444
00:19:42.559 --> 00:19:44.239
supposedly conscious mind,

445
00:19:44.239 --> 00:19:46.779
and your higher understanding or your higher intuition?

446
00:19:46.779 --> 00:19:48.719
<v ->Well it's the color that I was</v>

447
00:19:48.719 --> 00:19:50.519
when I was on the other side

448
00:19:50.519 --> 00:19:53.939
and add a little bit more white to it at that point

449
00:19:53.939 --> 00:19:56.540
and that's the way it was reflected to me

450
00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.179
in my experience there.

451
00:19:58.179 --> 00:20:00.819
So that's why I pull it in for me,

452
00:20:00.819 --> 00:20:03.940
it just is who I am, it's me.

453
00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.500
<v Voiceover>Well now, okay you're also called a walking,</v>

454
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.990
by doctors, doctors call you a walking MRI.

455
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.580
Are you one of these people that can choose to see

456
00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.201
or choose not to see, or are you seeing all the time?

457
00:20:19.201 --> 00:20:22.670
<v ->I am seeing all the time and I have a dimmer switch.</v>

458
00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.020
<v Voiceover>You do, good.</v>

459
00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.183
<v ->I do, I dial it down</v>

460
00:20:25.183 --> 00:20:28.163
and it's like being in a noisy, urban area

461
00:20:28.163 --> 00:20:31.633
that it becomes white noise after a while.

462
00:20:33.123 --> 00:20:35.763
Even though colors will flash here and there

463
00:20:35.763 --> 00:20:39.503
and it catches my attention or energy will fly

464
00:20:39.503 --> 00:20:41.703
this way and that way and it catches my attention,

465
00:20:41.703 --> 00:20:43.863
I try not to pay too much attention to it

466
00:20:43.863 --> 00:20:46.823
and so I dial it down and I never look at anybody's energy

467
00:20:46.823 --> 00:20:49.753
unless they've given me permission, you know.

468
00:20:50.044 --> 00:20:53.044
Even if I see something I don't go into it

469
00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:57.873
because I'm really skilled at going in deep.

470
00:20:58.204 --> 00:21:00.823
For what ever reason my intuitive sight

471
00:21:00.823 --> 00:21:04.583
can go down the level of an electron microscope and beyond

472
00:21:04.583 --> 00:21:06.964
and that's just for physical work with people

473
00:21:06.964 --> 00:21:09.783
so I can discern the difference between a bacterium

474
00:21:09.783 --> 00:21:11.733
or a viral component.

475
00:21:11.803 --> 00:21:14.524
You know, the difference between a red blood cell,

476
00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:17.164
a white blood cell, a cancer cell, things like that.

477
00:21:17.164 --> 00:21:21.083
I think if you're going to work publicly

478
00:21:21.083 --> 00:21:23.023
as a medical intuitive,

479
00:21:23.023 --> 00:21:25.303
you need to have a pretty high benchmark,

480
00:21:25.303 --> 00:21:28.143
it's not just about, oh there's sadness in the liver

481
00:21:28.143 --> 00:21:30.403
or there's a disruption

482
00:21:30.403 --> 00:21:33.364
and your Uncle Ralph is in your kidney from you know.

483
00:21:33.364 --> 00:21:35.863
You need a little bit more solid data than that.

484
00:21:35.863 --> 00:21:37.963
<v Voiceover>Yeah, if the physical</v>

485
00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:39.863
is what you're coming for, your concern.

486
00:21:39.863 --> 00:21:41.823
Now, can you talk about

487
00:21:41.823 --> 00:21:45.283
some of how you started refining that in yourself

488
00:21:45.283 --> 00:21:47.723
and also, you teach other people

489
00:21:47.723 --> 00:21:49.423
how to do this as well, right?

490
00:21:49.423 --> 00:21:52.583
<v ->Yes and I think the basics are,</v>

491
00:21:52.583 --> 00:21:56.333
and the fundamental practice is always meditation for me

492
00:21:56.623 --> 00:22:00.573
to be able to get in and sit calmly or not.

493
00:22:01.204 --> 00:22:03.083
You know, you don't measure your meditation practice,

494
00:22:03.083 --> 00:22:04.363
it is what it is.

495
00:22:04.363 --> 00:22:06.103
But that ability to watch your mind

496
00:22:06.103 --> 00:22:07.863
and understand the patterns of your mind,

497
00:22:07.863 --> 00:22:10.583
I think is critical when you're doing this work.

498
00:22:10.583 --> 00:22:12.244
Because you never know when energy

499
00:22:12.244 --> 00:22:14.663
or color or disease or a thought form

500
00:22:14.663 --> 00:22:17.873
is gonna come scurrying in front of your attention.

501
00:22:18.383 --> 00:22:19.983
You can't get carried away with that

502
00:22:19.983 --> 00:22:21.443
so you have to be able to sit

503
00:22:21.443 --> 00:22:23.753
in neutral, empty wisdom as best you can.

504
00:22:24.143 --> 00:22:26.404
So I started refining my skills

505
00:22:26.404 --> 00:22:28.643
because, again, it took about eight years

506
00:22:28.643 --> 00:22:32.575
for me to even cue into

507
00:22:33.544 --> 00:22:36.024
more Eastern thought and Chakras.

508
00:22:36.024 --> 00:22:37.924
I didn't even know what those were at the time

509
00:22:37.924 --> 00:22:42.034
and I practiced on inanimate objects,

510
00:22:42.704 --> 00:22:46.574
the trees, the flowers, because they were so enticing,

511
00:22:47.144 --> 00:22:48.614
they were beautiful.

512
00:22:49.584 --> 00:22:53.305
We had a grove of pear and cherry and apple trees

513
00:22:53.305 --> 00:22:55.645
out in our backyard in Indiana

514
00:22:55.645 --> 00:22:57.925
and for me to sit there in the spring

515
00:22:57.925 --> 00:23:01.125
and watch the energy in them come to life

516
00:23:01.125 --> 00:23:03.685
from February through blooming time

517
00:23:03.685 --> 00:23:05.855
was just phenomenal for me.

518
00:23:06.285 --> 00:23:09.405
Then I used to sit in college, I went back to Ohio State,

519
00:23:09.405 --> 00:23:11.405
to study anthropology because architecture

520
00:23:11.405 --> 00:23:13.405
was out of the question with my eyesight,

521
00:23:13.405 --> 00:23:15.265
and I'd sit in the back of the room

522
00:23:15.265 --> 00:23:18.165
and during testing time I'd watch

523
00:23:18.165 --> 00:23:20.935
everybody's energy fly all over the place.

524
00:23:21.085 --> 00:23:22.225
<v Voiceover>Lots of red.</v>

525
00:23:22.225 --> 00:23:23.665
<v ->Yeah, it was just hysterical</v>

526
00:23:23.665 --> 00:23:24.985
and I didn't go invade their lives

527
00:23:24.985 --> 00:23:28.636
I just looked at the over-shadowing fluctuations of energy,

528
00:23:28.685 --> 00:23:29.826
so I was doing my own

529
00:23:29.826 --> 00:23:31.775
little scientific studies, all the time.

530
00:23:31.925 --> 00:23:34.105
And it just developed from there because I'm just,

531
00:23:34.105 --> 00:23:37.636
got that curious kind of left brain thing going on

532
00:23:37.746 --> 00:23:39.426
and I think that's great to have.

533
00:23:39.426 --> 00:23:42.605
In fact that's my favorite skill set or setup

534
00:23:42.605 --> 00:23:45.085
to have a strong intellect and a strong intuitive side,

535
00:23:45.085 --> 00:23:47.025
because you need both of them in tandem

536
00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:49.695
to make it work to increase accuracy.

537
00:23:49.905 --> 00:23:52.105
<v Voiceover>Absolutely, now when you're looking</v>

538
00:23:52.105 --> 00:23:53.425
at the person's body

539
00:23:53.425 --> 00:23:57.355
where you're seeing a lot of dysfunction

540
00:23:58.225 --> 00:24:00.265
or a real slow-down of energy

541
00:24:00.265 --> 00:24:03.185
is it often kind of shadowed or darker?

542
00:24:03.185 --> 00:24:04.745
How does that appear to you?

543
00:24:04.745 --> 00:24:07.305
<v ->It can be, it'll show up as more congested</v>

544
00:24:07.305 --> 00:24:09.206
and more dense in the field

545
00:24:09.206 --> 00:24:11.846
and the colors can vary depending on what systems

546
00:24:11.846 --> 00:24:14.885
are going on in the body,

547
00:24:14.885 --> 00:24:17.215
as far as being more strained or not.

548
00:24:17.225 --> 00:24:20.185
Also what emotional attitude is associated with it,

549
00:24:20.185 --> 00:24:22.225
how spiritually awake are they

550
00:24:22.225 --> 00:24:24.165
to whatever is going on in their life

551
00:24:24.165 --> 00:24:26.995
or how awake do they want to be.

552
00:24:27.065 --> 00:24:28.665
Because a lot of people are very sensitive

553
00:24:28.665 --> 00:24:30.125
and they don't want to know,

554
00:24:30.125 --> 00:24:31.425
they don't want to know, they want to

555
00:24:31.425 --> 00:24:33.225
but they don't, they want to, but they don't.

556
00:24:33.225 --> 00:24:35.045
It's hard, I understand that place.

557
00:24:35.045 --> 00:24:38.045
It can be really scary to leap off into who you are

558
00:24:38.045 --> 00:24:40.855
because that means leaping off into the unknown.

559
00:24:41.185 --> 00:24:43.225
<v Voiceover>But what's so wonderful here</v>

560
00:24:43.225 --> 00:24:44.945
because you do have both

561
00:24:44.945 --> 00:24:47.545
the right and left hemispheres of the brain so well lit up,

562
00:24:47.545 --> 00:24:51.985
you can really see the realtionship

563
00:24:51.985 --> 00:24:54.326
between the thoughts and the emotions

564
00:24:54.326 --> 00:24:56.995
and then the physical manifestation.

565
00:24:57.245 --> 00:25:00.385
So if you were reading a person, personally,

566
00:25:00.385 --> 00:25:04.365
you would be able to key into, as you say,

567
00:25:04.365 --> 00:25:06.865
even the thoughts that are causing harm

568
00:25:06.865 --> 00:25:10.175
to a particular part of the body or a belief systems, even.

569
00:25:10.445 --> 00:25:11.985
Does it go even further back

570
00:25:11.985 --> 00:25:14.145
into unconscious belief systems,

571
00:25:14.145 --> 00:25:16.505
maybe even for those who believe in past lives,

572
00:25:16.505 --> 00:25:18.655
past-life type of phenomena?

573
00:25:18.965 --> 00:25:20.525
<v ->Yes, all of those are true</v>

574
00:25:20.525 --> 00:25:23.445
and I always ask clients what their intention is,

575
00:25:23.445 --> 00:25:24.645
what they want to work on.

576
00:25:24.645 --> 00:25:28.065
Some just say a category, like health or my relationships,

577
00:25:28.065 --> 00:25:29.805
or what should I do with my life?

578
00:25:29.805 --> 00:25:32.855
Others are more specific, case in point,

579
00:25:33.345 --> 00:25:35.785
a person asked me to look at their left knee,

580
00:25:35.785 --> 00:25:37.605
because their left knee was hurting

581
00:25:37.605 --> 00:25:39.635
and that's basically all they said.

582
00:25:39.665 --> 00:25:41.765
All the while their lower-back is lighting up,

583
00:25:41.765 --> 00:25:44.785
a horse shows up, three-and-a- half years shows up

584
00:25:44.785 --> 00:25:46.625
and a fall from the horse shows up.

585
00:25:46.625 --> 00:25:48.685
So I'm going okay, yeah left knee all right,

586
00:25:48.685 --> 00:25:51.745
we'll start up a little higher though if you don't mind.

587
00:25:51.745 --> 00:25:53.625
So that's why I ask people their intention

588
00:25:53.625 --> 00:25:56.005
when I go into work with them

589
00:25:56.005 --> 00:25:59.325
because part of it is that, you know,

590
00:25:59.325 --> 00:26:01.757
when your intuition is at this level

591
00:26:01.757 --> 00:26:03.677
and many people can get here

592
00:26:03.677 --> 00:26:05.317
and many people are already here,

593
00:26:05.317 --> 00:26:07.917
you can see whatever you want to see,

594
00:26:07.917 --> 00:26:10.117
just ask a question, we'll take a look at it.

595
00:26:10.117 --> 00:26:13.098
So I like people to be prioritized and focused

596
00:26:13.098 --> 00:26:15.257
because we only have a little time together

597
00:26:15.257 --> 00:26:17.177
and I want to create a really solid plan

598
00:26:17.177 --> 00:26:19.517
for them to get back to where they want to go

599
00:26:19.517 --> 00:26:21.677
and so that's why I ask for that intention

600
00:26:21.677 --> 00:26:23.797
because I get to watch their body's energy

601
00:26:23.797 --> 00:26:25.557
respond to their words

602
00:26:25.557 --> 00:26:28.217
and that's where I get congruencies or incongruencies,

603
00:26:28.217 --> 00:26:31.067
right off the bat and then we go in from there.

604
00:26:31.517 --> 00:26:34.537
Yes, past lives are often present,

605
00:26:34.537 --> 00:26:36.457
I tend not to go into there

606
00:26:36.457 --> 00:26:40.317
because many of my clients aren't there yet, some are.

607
00:26:40.317 --> 00:26:42.737
When I see that they're not there I don't go there,

608
00:26:42.737 --> 00:26:45.977
if they're right on the fence I'll gently say,

609
00:26:45.977 --> 00:26:48.967
you know this is a possibility, this is an option.

610
00:26:48.977 --> 00:26:50.537
I'll give them an exercise or something

611
00:26:50.537 --> 00:26:52.717
to help, maybe, bring some of that forward

612
00:26:52.717 --> 00:26:55.327
or I'll suggest they go to a past life therapist.

613
00:26:55.837 --> 00:26:56.977
<v Voiceover>Well, let's talk about it,</v>

614
00:26:56.977 --> 00:26:58.637
give if you wouldn't mind, give an example or two

615
00:26:58.637 --> 00:27:00.807
of a couple of situations in which

616
00:27:01.267 --> 00:27:05.847
a factor that was causing some kind of dis-ease or distress

617
00:27:05.847 --> 00:27:08.489
with the person was past life induced.

618
00:27:08.859 --> 00:27:12.259
<v ->Yes, not to long ago a female client</v>

619
00:27:12.259 --> 00:27:16.089
was having problems with a shoulder, a right shoulder,

620
00:27:16.419 --> 00:27:19.989
and there were several instances of where,

621
00:27:20.259 --> 00:27:22.919
not only in this life that shoulder had been damaged,

622
00:27:22.919 --> 00:27:25.940
but bullet wound all the way from the front of the chest

623
00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.909
all the way through the back.

624
00:27:28.479 --> 00:27:31.259
A hatchet of some sort from the Bronze Age,

625
00:27:31.259 --> 00:27:34.439
it was more a barbaric type of culture they were in,

626
00:27:34.439 --> 00:27:35.780
they didn't want to be a soldier,

627
00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.559
they were forced to be in it, you know.

628
00:27:37.559 --> 00:27:38.540
It's like--

629
00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.619
<v Voiceover>Not that good</v>

630
00:27:39.619 --> 00:27:40.619
with the wielding of the ax, huh?

631
00:27:40.619 --> 00:27:41.829
<v ->No, no they wanted to go be a baker, basically.</v>

632
00:27:41.829 --> 00:27:43.109
<v Voiceover>They were on the receiving end.</v>

633
00:27:43.109 --> 00:27:45.279
<v ->That's right, they wanted a passive life</v>

634
00:27:45.279 --> 00:27:47.139
but they were forced to go plunder and pillage

635
00:27:47.139 --> 00:27:49.609
and they got hit from behind.

636
00:27:49.681 --> 00:27:52.041
So the whole premise, the whole thought form

637
00:27:52.041 --> 00:27:56.671
was that, I don't want to be in this situation,

638
00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:58.792
I don't want to be where I am,

639
00:27:58.801 --> 00:28:00.441
and that thought form had carried all the way

640
00:28:00.441 --> 00:28:02.341
through all of these incidences

641
00:28:02.341 --> 00:28:04.191
and still locked in the shoulder.

642
00:28:04.641 --> 00:28:07.521
So we created a plan and haven't heard from her,

643
00:28:07.521 --> 00:28:09.661
cause this has been a little while,

644
00:28:09.661 --> 00:28:12.731
so hopefully I will, I'm sure she'll be fine.

645
00:28:12.961 --> 00:28:15.221
<v Voiceover>So when you, say with someone like this,</v>

646
00:28:15.221 --> 00:28:18.191
what kind of information would you give her?

647
00:28:18.281 --> 00:28:20.461
What would be your assessment of it

648
00:28:20.461 --> 00:28:22.731
and how to proceed to release this?

649
00:28:22.921 --> 00:28:25.881
<v ->Well, the good thing about this person, in particular,</v>

650
00:28:25.881 --> 00:28:29.511
she was on the fence, she was pretty close to being there.

651
00:28:29.521 --> 00:28:32.241
She was a little sheepish and she said,

652
00:28:32.241 --> 00:28:34.711
"Could this be related?"

653
00:28:34.961 --> 00:28:36.721
That was my open door,

654
00:28:36.721 --> 00:28:39.721
so I went in very compassionately and very gently

655
00:28:39.721 --> 00:28:42.331
and just, I kinda report, I'm a reporter.

656
00:28:42.681 --> 00:28:45.081
But some people, another issue,

657
00:28:45.081 --> 00:28:48.421
was as soon as she spoke about the fact

658
00:28:48.421 --> 00:28:51.161
that there's something going on in her throat,

659
00:28:51.161 --> 00:28:53.161
I immediately saw a noose around her neck

660
00:28:53.161 --> 00:28:55.061
and she was not open to past lives

661
00:28:55.061 --> 00:28:59.661
so we talked about the sensations of being choked.

662
00:28:59.661 --> 00:29:02.501
We talked about, you know as I was reading

663
00:29:02.501 --> 00:29:04.981
the thought forms in and around the tissue

664
00:29:04.981 --> 00:29:08.621
and the cartilage in the throat, the voice box,

665
00:29:08.621 --> 00:29:12.381
The energy outside the field, you know,

666
00:29:12.381 --> 00:29:14.221
picking up all those thought forms

667
00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:16.901
I could relay the primary consciousness

668
00:29:16.901 --> 00:29:18.821
and secondary levels of consciousness,

669
00:29:18.821 --> 00:29:23.141
even tertiary consciousness that she could get a hold of,

670
00:29:23.141 --> 00:29:24.821
she could get her mind around there

671
00:29:24.821 --> 00:29:26.101
and then later she said,

672
00:29:26.101 --> 00:29:28.351
"Well, it's like I've been strung up."

673
00:29:29.121 --> 00:29:30.421
<v Voiceover>There you go.</v>

674
00:29:30.421 --> 00:29:31.641
<v ->And I just said,</v>

675
00:29:31.641 --> 00:29:33.741
"Well, you're really getting in touch with things,

676
00:29:33.741 --> 00:29:35.161
"good for you."

677
00:29:35.161 --> 00:29:36.241
You know, I didn't lead into it,

678
00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:37.861
I just let her be where she is.

679
00:29:37.861 --> 00:29:40.481
<v Voiceover>Well, how does this then release</v>

680
00:29:40.481 --> 00:29:44.081
that feeling or the dis-ease in the area?

681
00:29:44.081 --> 00:29:46.782
<v ->Just the acknowledgement of it opens the door</v>

682
00:29:46.782 --> 00:29:49.501
and then I always give people exercises

683
00:29:49.501 --> 00:29:51.541
because you are your own best healer.

684
00:29:51.541 --> 00:29:53.862
And even though we've targeted a lot of things

685
00:29:53.862 --> 00:29:55.101
in a session,

686
00:29:55.101 --> 00:29:57.021
it's up to them to take responsibility,

687
00:29:57.021 --> 00:29:59.001
to pick up the mantle of their own healing

688
00:29:59.001 --> 00:30:00.481
and take it forward.

689
00:30:00.481 --> 00:30:03.321
The exercises are very simple, they're very poignant,

690
00:30:03.321 --> 00:30:05.101
to the point type of exercises,

691
00:30:05.101 --> 00:30:08.471
really dove-tailed for that specific person.

692
00:30:08.881 --> 00:30:13.281
Antidotes of healing slogans that are spot-on

693
00:30:13.281 --> 00:30:15.781
to the consciousness that we find in the body.

694
00:30:15.781 --> 00:30:18.441
Because if you start out with, I love you, I love you,

695
00:30:18.441 --> 00:30:20.861
I love you and your body's going, no you don't,

696
00:30:20.861 --> 00:30:23.141
I don't feel safe here, this is not gonna work,

697
00:30:23.141 --> 00:30:25.311
it's not gonna hear I love you.

698
00:30:25.561 --> 00:30:27.821
So we all know this, so you gotta start and work it up.

699
00:30:27.821 --> 00:30:29.441
You gotta get up the ramp to healing

700
00:30:29.441 --> 00:30:33.391
and so that's what we do and it seems to work for people.

701
00:30:34.561 --> 00:30:39.561
<v ->{Voiceover] What about looking at us en masse, over time,</v>

702
00:30:40.161 --> 00:30:41.561
I mean this is has been a long time

703
00:30:41.561 --> 00:30:44.221
since this sight has been fully developed in you.

704
00:30:45.051 --> 00:30:47.131
What are you seeing en masse,

705
00:30:47.401 --> 00:30:50.834
in terms of changes within people's fields and such?

706
00:30:51.404 --> 00:30:54.154
I don't know if that's a fair question to even ask,

707
00:30:54.634 --> 00:30:56.684
if it is, go for it.

708
00:30:56.895 --> 00:30:59.734
Are you seeing certain types of diseases on the rise,

709
00:30:59.734 --> 00:31:01.134
certain dysfunctions,

710
00:31:01.134 --> 00:31:02.694
certain color fields are really popping,

711
00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:04.015
what are you seeing?

712
00:31:04.015 --> 00:31:05.395
<v ->Well that's a really great question</v>

713
00:31:05.395 --> 00:31:06.895
because I do watch trends,

714
00:31:06.895 --> 00:31:09.286
I'm a macro, micro kind of gal,

715
00:31:09.415 --> 00:31:11.796
you know I like to look at all of that in between.

716
00:31:12.256 --> 00:31:15.575
One of the interesting things I've been noticing

717
00:31:16.285 --> 00:31:20.645
since 1989, more and more people

718
00:31:20.935 --> 00:31:24.727
are getting a more cobalt blue type of color,

719
00:31:24.776 --> 00:31:26.246
it's very iridescent,

720
00:31:26.376 --> 00:31:28.996
cobalt blue is the closest I can come to it

721
00:31:28.996 --> 00:31:30.746
and some cerulean blue

722
00:31:30.856 --> 00:31:33.206
and water from the Caribbean into it

723
00:31:33.237 --> 00:31:35.376
and light it up as if it's neon.

724
00:31:35.376 --> 00:31:38.616
It's a high vibration of spiritual wakefulness

725
00:31:38.616 --> 00:31:41.536
and these are the people that are really starting to wake up

726
00:31:41.536 --> 00:31:44.397
and then obviously going to help others

727
00:31:44.397 --> 00:31:45.696
do that along the way.

728
00:31:45.696 --> 00:31:48.516
And quite a few people have that, a lot of people have that,

729
00:31:48.516 --> 00:31:51.487
I'd say seven out of 10 of my clients

730
00:31:51.936 --> 00:31:56.936
have that going on in them, to varying degrees.

731
00:31:57.956 --> 00:32:00.716
It always starts in the outer-rim of the field

732
00:32:00.716 --> 00:32:03.106
and works it's way in.

733
00:32:03.296 --> 00:32:06.216
Then there are others that are having, kind of,

734
00:32:06.216 --> 00:32:08.756
a harder time and they're vibrating

735
00:32:08.756 --> 00:32:10.496
which always starts in the heart

736
00:32:10.496 --> 00:32:14.126
then spreads generally throughout the body.

737
00:32:15.236 --> 00:32:18.346
This is a response in the heart

738
00:32:19.156 --> 00:32:21.216
from who they are, what they're here to do

739
00:32:21.216 --> 00:32:23.686
and the timing of things that are going on here.

740
00:32:24.056 --> 00:32:27.646
I'm doing some work with a major hospital in New York City,

741
00:32:27.656 --> 00:32:29.466
their complimentary medical team

742
00:32:29.636 --> 00:32:32.556
and it started from being aware of this change

743
00:32:32.556 --> 00:32:36.556
in the physical heart, in the electricity in the heart

744
00:32:36.556 --> 00:32:38.396
and the electromagnetics that come from it.

745
00:32:38.396 --> 00:32:39.876
I've always known as a healer,

746
00:32:39.876 --> 00:32:42.156
as many healers I know recognize this,

747
00:32:42.156 --> 00:32:45.056
when you place your hand on somebody's heart,

748
00:32:45.056 --> 00:32:48.706
you can feel if they're doing their job or not,

749
00:32:48.836 --> 00:32:51.156
if they're really on purpose with who they are.

750
00:32:51.156 --> 00:32:53.236
Even if it's not, we don't want it to be a perfect picture,

751
00:32:53.236 --> 00:32:55.116
we just want you on the right highway,

752
00:32:55.116 --> 00:32:57.186
we all want to be on the right path.

753
00:32:57.336 --> 00:32:59.696
So you can tell that by looking and sensing

754
00:32:59.696 --> 00:33:02.216
the energy of the heart, literally the electronics

755
00:33:02.216 --> 00:33:04.676
that are going through the heart, making the heart pump

756
00:33:04.676 --> 00:33:07.206
and the electromagnetics coming off of that.

757
00:33:07.496 --> 00:33:11.116
I had a client who was found out later

758
00:33:11.116 --> 00:33:13.776
she was an attorney, so I was doing my thing,

759
00:33:13.776 --> 00:33:16.296
going in looking at the viral component that was going on,

760
00:33:16.296 --> 00:33:18.956
look at the irregularity of the heartbeat, et cetera

761
00:33:18.956 --> 00:33:22.306
and it was so clear to me, she was an artist,

762
00:33:22.337 --> 00:33:24.996
a profound artist trapped in a lawyer's body

763
00:33:24.996 --> 00:33:27.796
and she was miserable because of that

764
00:33:27.796 --> 00:33:30.206
and here comes cardio-cystitis.

765
00:33:30.576 --> 00:33:35.576
It was the sole, S-O-L-E, causation for that condition.

766
00:33:35.856 --> 00:33:38.177
That's another important note,

767
00:33:38.177 --> 00:33:41.636
when I look at anything, I look at like I said

768
00:33:41.636 --> 00:33:44.547
spiritual, energetic, emotional, biomechanical,

769
00:33:45.216 --> 00:33:47.356
there's always one that's a leading indicator

770
00:33:47.356 --> 00:33:50.846
that's a higher percentage of causation.

771
00:33:51.036 --> 00:33:53.316
And in her case, even though obviously,

772
00:33:53.316 --> 00:33:56.516
the physical was so important to take care of

773
00:33:56.516 --> 00:33:59.057
the leading indicator of this, the leading cause

774
00:33:59.057 --> 00:34:01.876
was that of her spiritual voice, her heart, her soul

775
00:34:01.876 --> 00:34:05.187
coming back online to what she's supposed to do.

776
00:34:05.456 --> 00:34:09.117
Well that was in May of this year and from that experience

777
00:34:09.117 --> 00:34:11.277
I got a hold of a friend and a client

778
00:34:11.277 --> 00:34:12.997
who works at this hospital

779
00:34:12.997 --> 00:34:17.267
in the heart transplant unit,

780
00:34:17.617 --> 00:34:20.217
so I've been working with them teaching them energy medicine

781
00:34:20.217 --> 00:34:23.087
and medical intuition and remote healing.

782
00:34:24.297 --> 00:34:27.638
Their first shot out of the gate

783
00:34:27.638 --> 00:34:32.388
was a gentleman who was in the rejection ward.

784
00:34:32.978 --> 00:34:34.078
<v Voiceover>What's that mean?</v>

785
00:34:34.078 --> 00:34:37.108
<v ->That means his heart transplant is at risk,</v>

786
00:34:37.478 --> 00:34:39.368
he's in risk of rejection.

787
00:34:39.998 --> 00:34:42.398
So we sat around

788
00:34:42.398 --> 00:34:44.818
and they had taken the tools that I'd taught them

789
00:34:44.818 --> 00:34:47.738
and we all worked together and I noticed right away

790
00:34:47.738 --> 00:34:51.648
that the donor's spirit was not very happy,

791
00:34:51.898 --> 00:34:54.708
very much in shock, didn't know where to go,

792
00:34:55.078 --> 00:34:58.438
clinging and hanging on and so I just simply asked,

793
00:34:58.438 --> 00:35:02.228
"What do you feel about the donor, where's their spirit at?"

794
00:35:02.698 --> 00:35:07.698
And they all start chiming up with the panic, fear, terror,

795
00:35:07.798 --> 00:35:10.979
some of the people cried on the team,

796
00:35:11.709 --> 00:35:13.409
so we all got the point.

797
00:35:13.409 --> 00:35:16.969
So we applied what many healers do, prayer,

798
00:35:16.969 --> 00:35:21.349
healing to that sweet spirit and you know,

799
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:23.429
20 minutes later that had released

800
00:35:23.429 --> 00:35:25.249
and then we applied the techniques

801
00:35:25.249 --> 00:35:27.359
to the donor and the new heart

802
00:35:27.749 --> 00:35:30.809
and we got an email from one of the team members

803
00:35:30.809 --> 00:35:31.929
that I work with

804
00:35:31.929 --> 00:35:34.409
that this person was released from the hospital

805
00:35:34.409 --> 00:35:37.359
the very next day and he was fine.

806
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:39.069
<v Voiceover>How much of the time</v>

807
00:35:39.069 --> 00:35:40.309
do you think that's what's happening,

808
00:35:40.309 --> 00:35:42.129
when people do organ transplants

809
00:35:42.129 --> 00:35:43.979
and their body is rejecting it?

810
00:35:44.049 --> 00:35:46.749
<v ->I think it's a significant component after this.</v>

811
00:35:46.749 --> 00:35:49.169
Now after this one situation

812
00:35:49.169 --> 00:35:53.049
we obviously don't have enough data to claim anything,

813
00:35:53.049 --> 00:35:56.169
nor would we, but it really made everybody go,

814
00:35:56.169 --> 00:35:59.679
"Oh, wow, this is great."

815
00:36:00.049 --> 00:36:02.379
So there has to be a lot more evidence

816
00:36:02.379 --> 00:36:06.709
to really be solid

817
00:36:07.121 --> 00:36:08.891
in this approach but--

818
00:36:09.061 --> 00:36:10.522
<v Voiceover>It certainly can't hurt</v>

819
00:36:10.522 --> 00:36:14.091
if a team is educated to send the soul of the person

820
00:36:14.091 --> 00:36:17.111
who may have just died, very tragically and quickly,

821
00:36:17.111 --> 00:36:20.321
on their way in peace and help them make that transition

822
00:36:20.321 --> 00:36:22.031
and release the body.

823
00:36:22.081 --> 00:36:25.112
<v ->And being myself, who's had that experience,</v>

824
00:36:25.112 --> 00:36:28.042
even in trauma but very willing to go,

825
00:36:28.712 --> 00:36:30.693
I know what it's like

826
00:36:30.693 --> 00:36:33.053
and I've worked enough with people that have crossed over

827
00:36:33.053 --> 00:36:35.013
that it's not the easiest thing to leave

828
00:36:35.013 --> 00:36:38.073
and so I think it's a significant component

829
00:36:38.073 --> 00:36:41.113
and of course Western medicine has a difficult time

830
00:36:41.113 --> 00:36:45.183
thinking about this aspect and they're working toward it.

831
00:36:45.213 --> 00:36:46.213
There are hospitals

832
00:36:46.213 --> 00:36:48.293
that are focused on patient centered care,

833
00:36:48.293 --> 00:36:51.793
not in this capacity at all, we're talking about, you know,

834
00:36:51.793 --> 00:36:53.733
eye-to-eye contact with the physician

835
00:36:53.733 --> 00:36:56.713
or pleasant colors in the room and things like that,

836
00:36:56.713 --> 00:36:59.683
but it's a start, it's a start, it's a good start.

837
00:36:59.913 --> 00:37:01.113
<v Voiceover>Yes, absolutely.</v>

838
00:37:01.113 --> 00:37:03.153
What about, you mentioned a moment ago,

839
00:37:03.153 --> 00:37:06.093
remote healing, as well, do you also work

840
00:37:06.093 --> 00:37:07.374
with remote healing?

841
00:37:07.374 --> 00:37:08.773
Do you teach people remote healing?

842
00:37:08.773 --> 00:37:09.853
<v ->Yes, I do.</v>

843
00:37:09.853 --> 00:37:13.773
In the early, 1999 through 2003,

844
00:37:13.773 --> 00:37:16.433
I was invited to be a remote healer

845
00:37:16.433 --> 00:37:19.374
with the California Pacific Medical Institute,

846
00:37:19.374 --> 00:37:23.344
a national institute for health study

847
00:37:23.593 --> 00:37:27.233
and we worked on remote healing for advanced HIV patients

848
00:37:27.233 --> 00:37:30.784
and I did that for three or four years.

849
00:37:30.813 --> 00:37:32.413
<v Voiceover>What kind of effects were you having?</v>

850
00:37:32.413 --> 00:37:34.223
<v ->We had really nice effects.</v>

851
00:37:34.233 --> 00:37:35.613
It was a double-blind study,

852
00:37:35.613 --> 00:37:37.453
we didn't know what was going on

853
00:37:37.453 --> 00:37:41.033
but the end result is that some of the patients did die

854
00:37:41.033 --> 00:37:44.334
but I believe that over 40% lived and thrived

855
00:37:44.334 --> 00:37:46.813
for a significant period of time,

856
00:37:46.813 --> 00:37:49.073
much longer than they were expected to

857
00:37:49.073 --> 00:37:52.083
and some, last I heard, were even still alive.

858
00:37:52.193 --> 00:37:57.083
So it showed that what we did as healers was effective.

859
00:37:58.014 --> 00:38:03.014
That was a wonderful part of my life to be involved in that

860
00:38:03.633 --> 00:38:05.233
and to help people in that way.

861
00:38:05.233 --> 00:38:06.713
So, not only based on that,

862
00:38:06.713 --> 00:38:08.733
but based on what I learned on the other side

863
00:38:08.733 --> 00:38:10.403
I do teach remote healing.

864
00:38:11.113 --> 00:38:13.203
<v Voiceover>Yes, what about remote diagnosis?</v>

865
00:38:13.293 --> 00:38:15.683
<v ->That as well, it's all part of it.</v>

866
00:38:16.333 --> 00:38:19.184
<v Voiceover>So someone can call you up and say,</v>

867
00:38:19.184 --> 00:38:21.824
"I want to talk to you but I can't get to you."

868
00:38:21.824 --> 00:38:24.084
and you're able to dial in and--

869
00:38:24.084 --> 00:38:26.604
<v ->Yes, all my work is really over the phone these days</v>

870
00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:28.754
because my clients are all over the world.

871
00:38:29.024 --> 00:38:30.564
And again, all I need is a first name

872
00:38:30.564 --> 00:38:33.114
and somebody's intention, you know.

873
00:38:33.204 --> 00:38:35.694
What do you want to discover?

874
00:38:36.324 --> 00:38:37.904
And it could be anything, it doesn't matter,

875
00:38:37.904 --> 00:38:39.784
I want to discover my soul's purpose,

876
00:38:39.784 --> 00:38:43.404
I want to discover what's wrong with this part of my body

877
00:38:43.404 --> 00:38:45.404
and I just want to look at my health

878
00:38:45.404 --> 00:38:47.914
and where should I live?

879
00:38:47.964 --> 00:38:49.354
I get everything.

880
00:38:49.484 --> 00:38:51.764
<v Voiceover>Might it even be a little bit cleaner</v>

881
00:38:51.764 --> 00:38:54.264
to not have the interference of everything going on

882
00:38:54.264 --> 00:38:56.914
and looking at them and watching everything fly?

883
00:38:56.944 --> 00:38:58.664
Is it maybe even a little quieter

884
00:38:58.664 --> 00:39:00.974
to be able to do it remotely in some way?

885
00:39:01.064 --> 00:39:04.444
<v ->It is and for me it allows me to be more exacting,</v>

886
00:39:04.444 --> 00:39:05.744
you know I'm a human being

887
00:39:05.744 --> 00:39:07.764
even though the doc's call me an MRI,

888
00:39:07.764 --> 00:39:11.454
I'm a human being and I'm not perfect,

889
00:39:11.804 --> 00:39:14.854
although I'm pretty good at what I do I must say

890
00:39:15.244 --> 00:39:19.694
and I sit on the floor and I look at a beige carpet

891
00:39:19.844 --> 00:39:21.924
or I look at a light yellow wall

892
00:39:21.924 --> 00:39:23.924
and there's nothing else in front of me,

893
00:39:23.924 --> 00:39:27.554
nothing else in front of me and my eyes are usually open

894
00:39:27.564 --> 00:39:30.354
because I just look through the wall.

895
00:39:30.704 --> 00:39:32.704
I just go to wherever they are,

896
00:39:32.704 --> 00:39:34.184
it doesn't matter where they are.

897
00:39:34.184 --> 00:39:35.544
And that's really fun,

898
00:39:35.544 --> 00:39:38.664
I am in awe of what we're capable of doing,

899
00:39:38.664 --> 00:39:41.384
every time I get the privilege to go into session.

900
00:39:41.384 --> 00:39:45.144
I mean this is an amazing skill that we all have

901
00:39:45.144 --> 00:39:48.624
and that's really where my focus is moving.

902
00:39:48.624 --> 00:39:51.484
I'll never let go of client work

903
00:39:51.484 --> 00:39:54.214
as long as somebody needs my help I'm there

904
00:39:54.264 --> 00:39:57.404
and I really want to move more into teaching.

905
00:39:57.404 --> 00:39:58.784
I've been teaching for 19 years,

906
00:39:58.784 --> 00:40:00.324
but I've really been in the trenches,

907
00:40:00.324 --> 00:40:04.844
I've been off the radar a lot of time and now it's time to,

908
00:40:04.844 --> 00:40:07.704
I know I've been hearing it, and it's time.

909
00:40:07.704 --> 00:40:08.864
<v Voiceover>Like what've you been hearing?</v>

910
00:40:08.864 --> 00:40:10.004
<v ->Well, their telling me,</v>

911
00:40:10.004 --> 00:40:11.344
"Get out there now, they need you now."

912
00:40:11.344 --> 00:40:13.324
Even more, so I haven't been teaching

913
00:40:13.324 --> 00:40:14.944
for about four or five years

914
00:40:14.944 --> 00:40:18.174
just because I have been doing other things

915
00:40:18.184 --> 00:40:20.504
and my father, God love him, has Alzheimer's

916
00:40:20.504 --> 00:40:22.164
so I just wanted to be a little closer

917
00:40:22.164 --> 00:40:24.644
and a little quieter life for a little while

918
00:40:24.644 --> 00:40:26.994
but really it's now this,

919
00:40:28.644 --> 00:40:30.685
it's not a pressure,

920
00:40:30.764 --> 00:40:33.674
but it's a compelling knowing

921
00:40:33.827 --> 00:40:37.366
that we're in a really important time right now

922
00:40:37.366 --> 00:40:41.046
and all of the teachers are being called forth

923
00:40:41.046 --> 00:40:44.736
and I just get to be one in the pack, you know.

924
00:40:45.306 --> 00:40:46.826
And it's an honor to be there

925
00:40:46.826 --> 00:40:50.606
and the other fascinating thing about my own journey

926
00:40:50.606 --> 00:40:53.406
is that I know it was taught to me

927
00:40:53.406 --> 00:40:56.216
that it would be in stages, as it always is,

928
00:40:56.526 --> 00:40:58.736
and this is one of these stages

929
00:40:58.866 --> 00:41:01.006
where I'm gonna be more active in teaching

930
00:41:01.006 --> 00:41:03.957
what I know because everybody's gotta get on board.

931
00:41:04.386 --> 00:41:07.346
<v Voiceover>I've been feeling, sensing</v>

932
00:41:07.346 --> 00:41:09.066
and saying the same thing,

933
00:41:09.066 --> 00:41:12.386
that we're in a time that requires us

934
00:41:12.386 --> 00:41:15.806
to be able to be in the deepest connection possible

935
00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:18.556
with our own intuitive source and guidance.

936
00:41:18.626 --> 00:41:20.426
There is just so much information

937
00:41:20.426 --> 00:41:21.806
we're being bombarded with,

938
00:41:21.806 --> 00:41:23.286
so much conflicting information,

939
00:41:23.286 --> 00:41:25.296
dis-information, everything.

940
00:41:25.547 --> 00:41:28.677
We have to be able to rely on ourselves is how I see it.

941
00:41:28.886 --> 00:41:31.166
<v ->Yes, I agree with you, I agree with you,</v>

942
00:41:31.166 --> 00:41:33.506
I think it's crucial that we trust ourselves

943
00:41:33.506 --> 00:41:37.536
and that's the trickiest part of intuition is trusting it.

944
00:41:37.907 --> 00:41:39.966
Because it really is like a GPS,

945
00:41:39.966 --> 00:41:44.277
it's very neutral, monotone, turn left, 300 feet,

946
00:41:44.507 --> 00:41:47.776
go down 50 feet, turn right on Washington Avenue,

947
00:41:47.826 --> 00:41:49.776
it has no emotion to it.

948
00:41:50.006 --> 00:41:53.046
And people want to get into it so bad

949
00:41:53.046 --> 00:41:55.986
that they let their emotions cover up

950
00:41:55.986 --> 00:41:57.947
that sweet little neutral voice

951
00:41:57.947 --> 00:42:00.707
which can sometimes be very loud and clear of course,

952
00:42:00.707 --> 00:42:03.866
if you're in any kind of danger, immediate danger

953
00:42:03.866 --> 00:42:06.046
or you've gotta make a move now

954
00:42:06.046 --> 00:42:07.746
and you haven't been listening, thank you very much,

955
00:42:07.746 --> 00:42:09.806
I'm going to kick you out of the way, here.

956
00:42:09.806 --> 00:42:12.196
So yeah, it comes in all kinds of tones.

957
00:42:12.406 --> 00:42:14.206
<v Voiceover>And it also comes in in these tones</v>

958
00:42:14.206 --> 00:42:16.566
when we have a vested interest in the outcome

959
00:42:16.566 --> 00:42:18.276
of something we're seeing.

960
00:42:18.306 --> 00:42:20.466
You know a lot of people will get there,

961
00:42:20.466 --> 00:42:22.146
say, little pendulum out and,

962
00:42:22.146 --> 00:42:24.587
"Does he love me, does he love me not?"

963
00:42:24.587 --> 00:42:26.286
This isn't the best way

964
00:42:26.286 --> 00:42:29.496
to get accurate, intuitive information.

965
00:42:29.906 --> 00:42:32.716
<v ->I agree with you, that's highly inaccurate.</v>

966
00:42:32.906 --> 00:42:36.627
Yes, it's like go back to the meditation cushion for awhile

967
00:42:36.627 --> 00:42:39.187
and just relax, zen out a little bit

968
00:42:39.187 --> 00:42:41.987
because you can't push another soul,

969
00:42:41.987 --> 00:42:44.097
you've just got to listen to your own,

970
00:42:44.147 --> 00:42:45.507
you gotta listen to your own.

971
00:42:45.507 --> 00:42:48.827
I'm not a naysayer of other tools, like cards

972
00:42:48.827 --> 00:42:51.647
or anything like that because I think they're fun tools

973
00:42:51.647 --> 00:42:54.607
and I think they add a safety net to a lot of people

974
00:42:54.607 --> 00:42:56.157
in their beginning.

975
00:42:56.307 --> 00:42:57.587
<v Voiceover>Some people are deeply intuitive anyway,</v>

976
00:42:57.587 --> 00:42:59.597
they can add a validation point, for example.

977
00:42:59.647 --> 00:43:00.867
<v ->Sure, they can, they can,</v>

978
00:43:00.867 --> 00:43:04.047
so I think they're great and I believe that people

979
00:43:04.047 --> 00:43:05.987
are already so highly intuitive

980
00:43:05.987 --> 00:43:07.567
I just kick them right out of the nest

981
00:43:07.567 --> 00:43:09.467
when I do my teaching's with them.

982
00:43:09.697 --> 00:43:13.828
Even beginners are reading within the first three hours

983
00:43:13.828 --> 00:43:15.238
of the course.

984
00:43:15.328 --> 00:43:16.308
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about that.</v>

985
00:43:16.308 --> 00:43:18.128
How long is the course and what do you cover,

986
00:43:18.128 --> 00:43:19.448
does it go in stages?

987
00:43:19.448 --> 00:43:20.548
So anyone listening

988
00:43:20.548 --> 00:43:23.108
who's really jumped up right now to do this thing

989
00:43:23.108 --> 00:43:25.028
will have an idea of what's available.

990
00:43:25.028 --> 00:43:29.318
<v ->I teach a two-day weekend course called Intuitive Wellness</v>

991
00:43:29.368 --> 00:43:32.698
and that focuses on getting right up the ramp

992
00:43:32.728 --> 00:43:34.188
and starting to read.

993
00:43:34.188 --> 00:43:35.888
Reading your own body's energy first

994
00:43:35.888 --> 00:43:37.868
and then reading other people

995
00:43:37.868 --> 00:43:40.788
and doing some modest, hands-on healing type of work

996
00:43:40.788 --> 00:43:42.069
just to get used to it.

997
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:44.649
And that really is a prerequisite in my classes,

998
00:43:44.649 --> 00:43:46.849
even if somebody's an experienced healer,

999
00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:49.449
I want them to understand the way in which I work

1000
00:43:49.449 --> 00:43:54.339
and resonate with the way I teach and I'm pretty easy.

1001
00:43:54.429 --> 00:43:56.249
I mean if anybody's in to astrology,

1002
00:43:56.249 --> 00:43:58.279
I've got seven planets in Libra, so.

1003
00:43:58.529 --> 00:44:01.619
You know, I'm not a tough person to get along with,

1004
00:44:01.709 --> 00:44:05.459
but I know what I'm here to do and I do it.

1005
00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:08.669
So that weekend is great, it's a lot of fun,

1006
00:44:08.669 --> 00:44:11.709
it's highly experiential, although for those that like data

1007
00:44:11.709 --> 00:44:13.739
and information, I give them that too.

1008
00:44:14.349 --> 00:44:18.369
Then I also teach medical intuition and energy medicine

1009
00:44:18.369 --> 00:44:22.259
and in that, that is a two year program

1010
00:44:22.929 --> 00:44:24.329
and it's much more intense

1011
00:44:24.329 --> 00:44:29.019
and we combine both on-site training's with teleconferences

1012
00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:32.889
and a one year gathering for anybody called a Kamm Jam

1013
00:44:32.889 --> 00:44:35.280
and we just have great time, we have a great time.

1014
00:44:35.309 --> 00:44:37.989
But I want people to be able

1015
00:44:37.989 --> 00:44:39.569
to go up to the highest level

1016
00:44:39.569 --> 00:44:41.609
of intuitive ability that they have

1017
00:44:41.609 --> 00:44:44.169
and if they want to call themselves a medical intuitive,

1018
00:44:44.169 --> 00:44:45.449
they're called to that work

1019
00:44:45.449 --> 00:44:47.419
because it's really specific work.

1020
00:44:47.469 --> 00:44:49.029
You can't be faint of heart

1021
00:44:49.029 --> 00:44:51.509
if you're gonna be a medical intuitive, you really cant.

1022
00:44:51.509 --> 00:44:52.489
<v Voiceover>No, not at all,</v>

1023
00:44:52.489 --> 00:44:53.569
you see things you don't want to see.

1024
00:44:53.569 --> 00:44:54.969
<v ->All the time, all the time.</v>

1025
00:44:54.969 --> 00:44:58.209
You're putting your consciousness inside people's organs,

1026
00:44:58.209 --> 00:45:02.239
inside disease, the consciousness of it,

1027
00:45:02.289 --> 00:45:04.009
all the time, all the time.

1028
00:45:04.009 --> 00:45:05.649
So you really can't be faint of heart

1029
00:45:05.649 --> 00:45:07.430
and you know I'm almost six feet tall,

1030
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:09.590
Swedish and German heritage,

1031
00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:11.969
so I think I can handle it.

1032
00:45:11.969 --> 00:45:13.229
<v Voiceover>You can handle it.</v>

1033
00:45:13.229 --> 00:45:14.249
<v ->So that old Swedish heritage</v>

1034
00:45:14.249 --> 00:45:18.729
but it's not for those who are more geared

1035
00:45:18.729 --> 00:45:20.289
for gentle, intuitive work

1036
00:45:20.289 --> 00:45:23.469
and that's why I teach hands-on healing too,

1037
00:45:23.469 --> 00:45:26.630
because those are for those who are so skilled

1038
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:27.989
at talking to angels

1039
00:45:27.989 --> 00:45:31.519
and so good at comforting and compassionate,

1040
00:45:31.519 --> 00:45:34.670
in a compassionate way, the body, and help heal that

1041
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:36.389
so I teach a variety of things.

1042
00:45:36.389 --> 00:45:37.813
I teach intuitive therapeutics

1043
00:45:37.813 --> 00:45:40.903
which is a hands-on and remote healing session.

1044
00:45:40.954 --> 00:45:42.533
So all of those are kind of lumped in

1045
00:45:42.533 --> 00:45:45.003
to the energy medicine work that I do.

1046
00:45:45.193 --> 00:45:46.553
<v Voiceover>Oh that's wonderful.</v>

1047
00:45:46.553 --> 00:45:49.613
So really, any area, to any degree

1048
00:45:49.613 --> 00:45:51.853
in which a person feels they want to develop themselves,

1049
00:45:51.853 --> 00:45:55.044
you're available, your course will cover that.

1050
00:45:55.044 --> 00:45:56.784
<v ->Yes, and I also do corporate training's</v>

1051
00:45:56.784 --> 00:45:59.324
or teach other people how to use intuition

1052
00:45:59.324 --> 00:46:01.034
on any other subject.

1053
00:46:01.124 --> 00:46:03.364
Because I'm really a structuralist,

1054
00:46:03.364 --> 00:46:07.744
the best time I've ever had where those first eight years

1055
00:46:07.744 --> 00:46:10.254
and then it's just added to that.

1056
00:46:10.364 --> 00:46:12.984
I got to learn without any other influence

1057
00:46:12.984 --> 00:46:15.544
of any other kind of idea or metodology

1058
00:46:15.544 --> 00:46:18.144
what the structure of energy was

1059
00:46:18.144 --> 00:46:21.364
and it was like I was being isolated through those years

1060
00:46:21.364 --> 00:46:23.865
so I could develop my own understanding

1061
00:46:23.865 --> 00:46:28.065
of the way particles work and what that means

1062
00:46:28.065 --> 00:46:30.264
and the speed at which things come in

1063
00:46:30.264 --> 00:46:32.084
and what's that trajectory really mean

1064
00:46:32.084 --> 00:46:35.204
and how to dissect and thin-slice that trajectory

1065
00:46:35.204 --> 00:46:37.764
all the way through, the outer perimeter of the field

1066
00:46:37.764 --> 00:46:39.364
all the way into an organ system,

1067
00:46:39.364 --> 00:46:41.764
all the way into a cell and then back out again

1068
00:46:41.764 --> 00:46:43.604
in a healing method.

1069
00:46:43.604 --> 00:46:45.324
I mean it was just the best time

1070
00:46:45.324 --> 00:46:47.904
because I had nobody telling me I was right or wrong

1071
00:46:47.904 --> 00:46:49.714
except for myself

1072
00:46:49.744 --> 00:46:53.004
and then I had guides telling me,

1073
00:46:53.004 --> 00:46:55.264
"No, you are right, it's okay, look at this,

1074
00:46:55.264 --> 00:46:56.644
"look at it this way.

1075
00:46:56.644 --> 00:46:59.344
"Turn it around, go around behind, look at it this way."

1076
00:46:59.344 --> 00:47:01.594
So I just had an incredible time.

1077
00:47:02.364 --> 00:47:03.524
<v Voiceover>What happens,</v>

1078
00:47:03.524 --> 00:47:06.184
this is something as I was hearing you just now,

1079
00:47:06.184 --> 00:47:10.065
I was thinking about breath, in terms of the speed

1080
00:47:10.065 --> 00:47:11.664
at which energy moves and so forth.

1081
00:47:11.664 --> 00:47:13.994
How does breath play into all of this?

1082
00:47:14.204 --> 00:47:16.675
<v ->That's a really great question.</v>

1083
00:47:17.064 --> 00:47:22.024
Breath, in my experience, just expands and opens everything

1084
00:47:22.024 --> 00:47:24.945
because of the natural way the breath responds

1085
00:47:24.945 --> 00:47:26.945
in the autonomic nervous system,

1086
00:47:26.945 --> 00:47:28.824
both speeding it up on the in-breath

1087
00:47:28.824 --> 00:47:31.194
and relaxing it on the out-breath.

1088
00:47:31.385 --> 00:47:33.464
It changes the way the field moves,

1089
00:47:33.464 --> 00:47:34.824
just for a moment or two,

1090
00:47:34.824 --> 00:47:37.024
and the interesting thing about it is

1091
00:47:37.024 --> 00:47:38.584
when I have my clients breath,

1092
00:47:38.584 --> 00:47:41.244
because sometimes they get all tense and argh,

1093
00:47:41.244 --> 00:47:43.814
you know, just nervous, they're not feeling well.

1094
00:47:43.924 --> 00:47:45.384
<v Voiceover>And well, they think</v>

1095
00:47:45.384 --> 00:47:46.544
she's seeing right through me,

1096
00:47:46.544 --> 00:47:48.004
she can see everything about me,

1097
00:47:48.004 --> 00:47:50.695
goodness what if I screwed up here and there?

1098
00:47:50.824 --> 00:47:51.984
<v ->Well and haven't we all,</v>

1099
00:47:51.984 --> 00:47:53.344
<v Voiceover>Yeah, yeah, exactly.</v>

1100
00:47:53.344 --> 00:47:55.084
<v ->That's my attitude about it, haven't we all.</v>

1101
00:47:55.084 --> 00:47:56.685
But when they take that breath

1102
00:47:56.685 --> 00:47:59.594
it just lets everything in the field fall into place

1103
00:48:00.384 --> 00:48:03.584
to where I need to be able to see the thought forms

1104
00:48:03.584 --> 00:48:05.784
and how they relate

1105
00:48:05.784 --> 00:48:10.274
and what's this form of particles doing over here?

1106
00:48:10.274 --> 00:48:11.504
What does it mean

1107
00:48:11.504 --> 00:48:13.834
and what are the myriad of colors within that meaning,

1108
00:48:13.834 --> 00:48:16.184
where are they going, what's the speed of it, et cetera.

1109
00:48:16.184 --> 00:48:17.884
It's fascinating work,

1110
00:48:17.884 --> 00:48:20.366
so that's what I teach in my medical intuitive work

1111
00:48:20.366 --> 00:48:23.546
and it doesn't matter if you can see things or not

1112
00:48:23.546 --> 00:48:26.406
and I really want to stress that because we can develop it

1113
00:48:26.406 --> 00:48:30.057
up to a very heightened and exacting way of feeling

1114
00:48:30.367 --> 00:48:34.217
and I've developed a hierarchy, if you will,

1115
00:48:34.467 --> 00:48:36.908
similar to Maslow's hierarchy of needs,

1116
00:48:36.908 --> 00:48:38.647
his top tier was transcendence

1117
00:48:38.647 --> 00:48:42.078
and so I kind of start down at the bottom where instinct is,

1118
00:48:42.127 --> 00:48:44.118
because that's the first level of intuition,

1119
00:48:44.427 --> 00:48:46.427
and then we go to raw empathy

1120
00:48:46.427 --> 00:48:47.778
where people just feel what they feel

1121
00:48:47.778 --> 00:48:49.098
and they don't know where it is

1122
00:48:49.098 --> 00:48:50.818
or where's it's coming from but they feel it

1123
00:48:50.818 --> 00:48:52.378
and then we go to directional empathy.

1124
00:48:52.378 --> 00:48:54.058
Where I know that was coming from over there

1125
00:48:54.058 --> 00:48:56.218
or that person in the third row back

1126
00:48:56.218 --> 00:48:58.118
is really upset about something,

1127
00:48:58.118 --> 00:49:00.878
you know that's more of a directional empathy.

1128
00:49:00.878 --> 00:49:04.148
Then we get into more psychic ability

1129
00:49:04.218 --> 00:49:05.778
where you get more and more information

1130
00:49:05.778 --> 00:49:08.289
and then we get into telepathy

1131
00:49:08.358 --> 00:49:09.878
where you're really hearing streams

1132
00:49:09.878 --> 00:49:12.578
and feeling and seeing streams of thought form

1133
00:49:12.578 --> 00:49:14.558
and then you get up to an intuitive,

1134
00:49:14.558 --> 00:49:16.878
which is just neutral, full-on data,

1135
00:49:16.878 --> 00:49:19.068
everything's, all the pistons are firing.

1136
00:49:20.678 --> 00:49:23.959
<v Voiceover>Well, just as a little tiny aside,</v>

1137
00:49:23.959 --> 00:49:26.819
a few years ago, probably about five years ago,

1138
00:49:26.819 --> 00:49:30.239
I went to a medical intuitive course for a day,

1139
00:49:30.239 --> 00:49:31.359
for an hour actually,

1140
00:49:31.359 --> 00:49:33.579
but prior to that I'd been seeing things

1141
00:49:33.579 --> 00:49:37.479
like black holes where a uterus used to be

1142
00:49:37.479 --> 00:49:38.699
and so forth,

1143
00:49:38.699 --> 00:49:39.879
and I was one of those people

1144
00:49:39.879 --> 00:49:42.319
who was actually just a little to faint of heart

1145
00:49:42.319 --> 00:49:44.579
to deal with all the things that I was seeing

1146
00:49:44.579 --> 00:49:45.939
and backed off on it,

1147
00:49:45.939 --> 00:49:47.999
yet I found that the healing part

1148
00:49:47.999 --> 00:49:50.279
was very easy and enjoyable

1149
00:49:50.279 --> 00:49:52.199
and so it must be that everybody

1150
00:49:52.199 --> 00:49:54.239
falls within these various ranges

1151
00:49:54.239 --> 00:49:58.449
of what they feel compatible with even doing themselves.

1152
00:49:58.639 --> 00:50:01.119
So you can speak to all of us.

1153
00:50:01.119 --> 00:50:03.239
<v ->I can because I've been there.</v>

1154
00:50:03.239 --> 00:50:04.580
<v Voiceover>That's wonderful.</v>

1155
00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:06.839
<v ->You know I've been there and it's just my job,</v>

1156
00:50:06.839 --> 00:50:08.859
this is the reason I came back

1157
00:50:08.859 --> 00:50:12.039
and there's never been any question in my heart

1158
00:50:12.039 --> 00:50:14.759
or in my mind about what I'm here to do

1159
00:50:14.759 --> 00:50:17.989
and there's no question about it.

1160
00:50:18.299 --> 00:50:20.219
And as soon as I came back I knew

1161
00:50:20.219 --> 00:50:22.110
everything was going to be different.

1162
00:50:22.539 --> 00:50:24.729
<v Voiceover>And it was and it's beautiful</v>

1163
00:50:24.759 --> 00:50:27.689
and you have one of the most beautiful countenances.

1164
00:50:27.799 --> 00:50:29.489
Your energy field is just,

1165
00:50:29.619 --> 00:50:34.529
I feel like I'm sitting in a lovely cloud,

1166
00:50:34.799 --> 00:50:36.500
a lovely cloud of love.

1167
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.519
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1168
00:50:37.519 --> 00:50:38.819
<v Voiceover>Like little fluffy clouds of love,</v>

1169
00:50:38.819 --> 00:50:39.799
you're just a beautiful being

1170
00:50:39.799 --> 00:50:42.479
and I thank you so much for taking the time to be with us

1171
00:50:42.479 --> 00:50:44.300
and I'm sure you're going to be getting

1172
00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.529
a lot of people wanting to contact you about this one.

1173
00:50:46.639 --> 00:50:47.540
<v ->My pleasure.</v>

1174
00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:48.439
<v Voiceover>Thank you.</v>

1175
00:50:48.439 --> 00:50:50.389
<v ->My pleasure, thank you.</v>

1176
00:50:51.279 --> 00:50:52.879
<v ->You can find Laura Kamm's work available</v>

1177
00:50:52.879 --> 00:50:55.019
at energymedicine.org.

1178
00:50:55.019 --> 00:50:57.059
She has listings of all of her workshops

1179
00:50:57.059 --> 00:51:00.630
plus radio shows and online courses and much more.

1180
00:51:00.679 --> 00:51:02.540
As she mentioned she still makes time

1181
00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:04.859
for private readings as well for those of you inclined.

1182
00:51:04.859 --> 00:51:08.129
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1183
00:51:09.679 --> 00:51:14.009
(mellow instrumental music)
