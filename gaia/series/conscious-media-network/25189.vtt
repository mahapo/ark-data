00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.134
(mystical instrumental music)

2
00:00:15.455 --> 00:00:16.674
<v ->The THEO Group,</v>

3
00:00:16.674 --> 00:00:18.370
a group of higher dimensional beings

4
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.270
channeled by Sheila Gillette

5
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.570
has a track record that has brought credibility

6
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.650
to the subject of channeling.

7
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.381
Back in the late 1970s and early 80s,

8
00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:28.810
THEO told of the great economic

9
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.030
and political upheaval

10
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.750
that would heighten between the years of 2012 and 2015.

11
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.890
Now, more than 35 years later,

12
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.410
no one would deny the truth in those words.

13
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.910
With the economy on everyone's mind,

14
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.370
as well as our evolution as a species,

15
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.795
I chose to speak with THEO once again,

16
00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:47.745
focusing on the great opportunity

17
00:00:47.745 --> 00:00:49.505
of these times in which we live.

18
00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:51.741
It was a profound conversation.

19
00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:55.065
It's so nice to be sitting with you again, Sheila.

20
00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:56.806
And this is a proficuous time,

21
00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:57.805
because here it is,

22
00:00:57.805 --> 00:01:00.215
as the first time we've seen you, 2012.

23
00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:03.365
And, of course, everybody's abuzz with 2012

24
00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:06.965
and all the misinformation, disinformation,

25
00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:10.155
misconceptions about what 2012 is,

26
00:01:10.155 --> 00:01:11.916
and that really seems to depend

27
00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:13.805
upon our own mindset to a large degree.

28
00:01:13.805 --> 00:01:16.005
And is that what you're finding?

29
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:16.925
<v ->Oh, definitely.</v>

30
00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:18.386
And you know, THEO's been talking

31
00:01:18.386 --> 00:01:20.835
about 2012 since the 70s.

32
00:01:20.835 --> 00:01:23.985
Since before Jose Arguelles and my book,

33
00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:25.596
The 5th Dimension.

34
00:01:25.596 --> 00:01:27.285
They brought up 2012

35
00:01:27.285 --> 00:01:28.865
and what would be happening.

36
00:01:28.865 --> 00:01:31.085
And that the fifth dimensionary energy's

37
00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:32.705
fully in place now on the planet,

38
00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:34.775
and what that means for all of us.

39
00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:38.265
You know, it's a combination of an energetic shift

40
00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:40.765
that has been going on for several decades.

41
00:01:40.765 --> 00:01:41.745
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

42
00:01:41.745 --> 00:01:43.485
<v ->And so now, it's just a combination</v>

43
00:01:43.485 --> 00:01:45.775
of that being fully in place.

44
00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:48.505
And what they speak about is it's the opportunity

45
00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:52.875
for all of us to recognize the masters that we are.

46
00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:56.575
And the changes that are coming

47
00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:58.985
are the changes from within.

48
00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:01.085
You know, many have predicted

49
00:02:01.085 --> 00:02:03.405
the world ending and all kinds of things.

50
00:02:03.405 --> 00:02:04.485
That's not gonna happen.

51
00:02:04.485 --> 00:02:06.845
The world is ending as we know it,

52
00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:09.115
in certain structures.

53
00:02:09.115 --> 00:02:11.055
Necessarily so.

54
00:02:11.055 --> 00:02:13.635
But a whole new way of being

55
00:02:13.635 --> 00:02:15.765
is being birthed right now,

56
00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:17.885
for all of us, as a global community.

57
00:02:17.885 --> 00:02:19.745
Common unity of human kind.

58
00:02:19.745 --> 00:02:21.655
<v Voiceover>Yes, and if we start</v>

59
00:02:21.655 --> 00:02:23.895
looking back on our lives and the consciousness

60
00:02:23.895 --> 00:02:25.665
that existed three decades ago.

61
00:02:25.665 --> 00:02:28.516
When I first started in all of this,

62
00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:31.475
you started probably close to a decade before I did.

63
00:02:31.475 --> 00:02:34.215
As you say, this was way before Jose Arguelles,

64
00:02:34.215 --> 00:02:36.525
before John Major Jenkins started in it.

65
00:02:36.525 --> 00:02:37.965
Before all the people who are really

66
00:02:37.965 --> 00:02:40.515
the grandfathers of this movement now,

67
00:02:40.515 --> 00:02:42.285
THEO was already talking about it.

68
00:02:42.285 --> 00:02:45.945
And I read your book, 5th Dimension, way back.

69
00:02:45.945 --> 00:02:48.405
And that information was a collation

70
00:02:48.405 --> 00:02:51.155
of information from the 10 years prior.

71
00:02:51.155 --> 00:02:54.435
And this, very specifically, the THEO Group

72
00:02:54.435 --> 00:02:57.126
was speaking about 2012 to 2015,

73
00:02:57.126 --> 00:02:59.585
and we're going to talk to THEO about that

74
00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:00.465
in a few minutes.

75
00:03:00.465 --> 00:03:02.705
About very specific things taking place.

76
00:03:02.705 --> 00:03:03.885
And that was 40 years ago.

77
00:03:03.885 --> 00:03:04.626
<v ->Yes.</v>

78
00:03:04.626 --> 00:03:06.165
<v Voiceover>And they really nailed</v>

79
00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:08.305
exactly what's happening right now,

80
00:03:08.305 --> 00:03:09.775
as they always do.
<v Sheila>Yeah.</v>

81
00:03:09.775 --> 00:03:12.175
Well, and you know when they start talking about it,

82
00:03:12.175 --> 00:03:16.055
and you know, the Berlin Wall was still in place,

83
00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:17.125
and they said there was gonna be this

84
00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:19.695
global peace that would come,

85
00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:21.665
in time,

86
00:03:21.665 --> 00:03:23.935
through this global community.

87
00:03:23.935 --> 00:03:26.305
You know, the internet wasn't even birthed then.

88
00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:29.805
And so, in my mind was, "Well, okay.

89
00:03:29.805 --> 00:03:32.185
But how is that all gonna happen

90
00:03:32.185 --> 00:03:33.815
without a world war?"

91
00:03:33.815 --> 00:03:35.725
You know, a great world war.

92
00:03:35.725 --> 00:03:39.605
And they said it'll start in the Baltic states,

93
00:03:39.605 --> 00:03:42.167
because it'll be the voice of the people saying,

94
00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:43.438
"We need change."

95
00:03:43.438 --> 00:03:48.018
And I thought, "Oh, okay."

96
00:03:48.018 --> 00:03:49.518
And a few months later,

97
00:03:49.518 --> 00:03:53.778
after The 5th Dimensionary book was out,

98
00:03:55.198 --> 00:03:58.608
in 1988, December of '88,

99
00:03:58.608 --> 00:04:00.338
in August of 1989,

100
00:04:00.338 --> 00:04:03.178
the Berlin Wall came down.

101
00:04:03.178 --> 00:04:08.168
And not really geographically brilliant,

102
00:04:08.168 --> 00:04:11.898
I did not realize that Germany's a Baltic state.

103
00:04:11.898 --> 00:04:15.618
And THEO had said it'll start in the Baltic states.

104
00:04:15.618 --> 00:04:18.978
And it did, then, and it's been an evolution of that.

105
00:04:18.978 --> 00:04:22.148
And now with the internet and technology that we have,

106
00:04:22.148 --> 00:04:24.298
and the global connectivity that we have,

107
00:04:24.298 --> 00:04:27.558
we're witnessing all of these old structures

108
00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:29.728
that don't work, dissolving,

109
00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:31.878
and the people standing up and saying,

110
00:04:31.878 --> 00:04:36.198
"No, we're not going to be dictated to anymore."

111
00:04:36.198 --> 00:04:37.758
<v Voiceover>And this is happen, as we can see,</v>

112
00:04:37.758 --> 00:04:39.358
this is happening globally.

113
00:04:39.358 --> 00:04:40.619
And even where it's not happening,

114
00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:43.059
there are changes in regimes and power,

115
00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:46.388
and dying away of certain dictatorships and such.

116
00:04:46.388 --> 00:04:49.018
We're witnessing the birth all around us

117
00:04:49.018 --> 00:04:50.898
of something new, but more so,

118
00:04:50.898 --> 00:04:54.268
it's the kind of questions people are beginning to ask.

119
00:04:54.268 --> 00:04:55.078
<v ->Very much so.
<v Voiceover>Inside.</v>

120
00:04:55.078 --> 00:04:56.788
And that seems to be,

121
00:04:56.788 --> 00:04:59.048
and I know THEO talks about this quite a lot.

122
00:04:59.048 --> 00:04:59.578
<v ->Yes.</v>

123
00:04:59.578 --> 00:05:01.878
<v Voiceover>And so, what I thought we would do,</v>

124
00:05:01.878 --> 00:05:04.588
and we've talked about beforehand, obviously,

125
00:05:04.588 --> 00:05:06.478
is if you don't mind,

126
00:05:06.478 --> 00:05:08.378
just stepping aside for a little bit

127
00:05:08.378 --> 00:05:11.138
and letting THEO come through and talk with us.

128
00:05:11.138 --> 00:05:12.778
I'll ask some questions on behalf

129
00:05:12.778 --> 00:05:16.628
of all of our viewers, regarding the times at hand.

130
00:05:16.628 --> 00:05:18.248
Some specifics.

131
00:05:18.248 --> 00:05:18.958
<v ->Great.</v>

132
00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:19.838
<v Voiceover>Okay?</v>

133
00:05:19.838 --> 00:05:20.478
<v ->Alright.</v>

134
00:05:20.478 --> 00:05:21.368
<v Voiceover>We'll see you in a little bit.</v>

135
00:05:21.368 --> 00:05:23.458
<v ->Okay, I will invite them in and I'll talk to you later.</v>

136
00:05:23.458 --> 00:05:24.903
<v Voiceover>Yes, okay.</v>

137
00:05:24.903 --> 00:05:28.443
(heavy breathing)

138
00:05:40.238 --> 00:05:42.178
<v ->It is the beginning, is it now?</v>

139
00:05:42.178 --> 00:05:43.378
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

140
00:05:43.378 --> 00:05:45.638
<v ->We are appreciative of the opportunity</v>

141
00:05:45.638 --> 00:05:47.498
to be of service unto you.

142
00:05:47.498 --> 00:05:48.598
You may ask.

143
00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:49.858
<v Voiceover>Thank you for joining us, THEO.</v>

144
00:05:49.858 --> 00:05:52.149
I appreciate your coming through Sheila

145
00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:55.348
to talk to our audience about 2012, that would like,

146
00:05:55.348 --> 00:05:57.398
I would like to have that as the topic today,

147
00:05:57.398 --> 00:05:58.438
if you're good with that.

148
00:05:58.438 --> 00:06:00.798
<v ->It is of acceptance, you may ask.</v>

149
00:06:00.798 --> 00:06:02.468
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

150
00:06:02.468 --> 00:06:05.848
We were just, Sheila and I were just talking that

151
00:06:05.848 --> 00:06:09.538
back 40 years ago, nearly 40 years ago,

152
00:06:09.538 --> 00:06:11.558
you were talking very specifically

153
00:06:11.558 --> 00:06:14.198
about events that would begin transpiring

154
00:06:14.198 --> 00:06:16.228
over decades, but start culminating

155
00:06:16.228 --> 00:06:19.488
between 2012 and 2015.

156
00:06:19.488 --> 00:06:22.138
And to start this conversation,

157
00:06:22.138 --> 00:06:24.558
I would like to ask if you could give us

158
00:06:24.558 --> 00:06:26.738
an overview of what you have witnessed

159
00:06:26.738 --> 00:06:29.318
from your dimension that has happened.

160
00:06:29.318 --> 00:06:33.168
The progression of shift in consciousness

161
00:06:33.168 --> 00:06:36.288
and events over the last 30, 40 years

162
00:06:36.288 --> 00:06:39.958
since you first started talking about this through Sheila.

163
00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.488
<v ->What has been occurring,</v>

164
00:06:41.488 --> 00:06:44.038
is there is a realization of the third dimension,

165
00:06:44.038 --> 00:06:46.528
which is your physical reality.

166
00:06:46.528 --> 00:06:48.529
The fourth dimensionary energy has been

167
00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:52.048
a spiritual awakening, which has been in waves,

168
00:06:52.048 --> 00:06:56.338
decade after decade, in the last 100 years,

169
00:06:56.338 --> 00:06:57.378
in actuality.

170
00:06:57.378 --> 00:06:58.518
<v Voiceover>Yes, that would be true.</v>

171
00:06:58.518 --> 00:07:01.958
<v ->However, what has been happening of late,</v>

172
00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.038
there has been a quickening, energetically,

173
00:07:04.038 --> 00:07:06.258
for the fifth dimensionary energy.

174
00:07:06.258 --> 00:07:10.968
Is that, which is the energy, that the masters hold.

175
00:07:10.968 --> 00:07:12.865
That have been the teachers,

176
00:07:14.078 --> 00:07:17.618
that have given prophesies throughout the ages,

177
00:07:17.618 --> 00:07:21.068
holding an energetic level of masterhood.

178
00:07:21.068 --> 00:07:22.838
And in that energy,

179
00:07:22.838 --> 00:07:26.778
is the presence now for all human beings,

180
00:07:26.778 --> 00:07:29.228
to actualize that

181
00:07:29.228 --> 00:07:31.538
within themselves.

182
00:07:31.538 --> 00:07:33.530
So what is occurring now,

183
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.978
are the changes necessary

184
00:07:35.978 --> 00:07:38.408
within each belief system

185
00:07:38.408 --> 00:07:41.468
to accept and know one is worthy

186
00:07:41.468 --> 00:07:43.438
of the masterhood.

187
00:07:43.438 --> 00:07:46.908
And that, which is the divine being that they are.

188
00:07:46.908 --> 00:07:50.318
So it is a process of self-integration,

189
00:07:50.318 --> 00:07:52.559
soul-integration, if you would,

190
00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:55.828
that allows the beings to be conscious,

191
00:07:55.828 --> 00:07:58.569
of the empowerment of this time.

192
00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:01.878
<v Voiceover>Yes, and this has, there,</v>

193
00:08:01.878 --> 00:08:05.198
I mean, there are certain practices that enhance this,

194
00:08:05.198 --> 00:08:07.088
which we'll go into in a little bit.

195
00:08:07.088 --> 00:08:09.858
But one of the things that's come up recently

196
00:08:09.858 --> 00:08:12.578
is film,

197
00:08:12.578 --> 00:08:15.018
photographs from NASA

198
00:08:15.018 --> 00:08:16.958
that are showing this incredible energy

199
00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.978
pulsing from the center of the Milky Way Galaxy,

200
00:08:19.978 --> 00:08:22.978
which, of course, are our sun and solar system

201
00:08:22.978 --> 00:08:26.198
is moving right into alignment with.

202
00:08:26.198 --> 00:08:28.768
And they've talked about this great awakening

203
00:08:28.768 --> 00:08:31.778
happening through these cosmic impulses and energy.

204
00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:34.198
Can you explain the nuts and bolts

205
00:08:34.198 --> 00:08:35.788
of what's happening here?

206
00:08:37.248 --> 00:08:39.898
<v ->The explanation, scientifically,</v>

207
00:08:39.898 --> 00:08:43.838
would be far beyond most's comprehension.

208
00:08:43.838 --> 00:08:47.019
But what we speak of is the impact on the individual.

209
00:08:48.059 --> 00:08:50.158
So that which has been dormant

210
00:08:50.158 --> 00:08:52.198
may rise within the individual.

211
00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:54.818
Whether it be emotional or physical.

212
00:08:54.818 --> 00:08:56.999
So one must be attentive

213
00:08:56.999 --> 00:08:59.349
to caring for the physical body

214
00:08:59.349 --> 00:09:03.009
and the emotional experience of one's life.

215
00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:05.738
Recognizing how beliefs have not been

216
00:09:05.738 --> 00:09:09.258
lovable and worthy enough arise.

217
00:09:09.258 --> 00:09:12.118
There's remembrances of those circumstances

218
00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:15.048
and a reframing of those beliefs,

219
00:09:15.048 --> 00:09:17.098
as they are recognized.

220
00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:19.768
No longer unconscious to one's

221
00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:23.300
emotional response to life.

222
00:09:24.218 --> 00:09:25.168
<v Voiceover>Yes--</v>

223
00:09:25.168 --> 00:09:28.278
<v ->And so it is an activation, as it were.</v>

224
00:09:28.278 --> 00:09:30.058
<v Voiceover>And it's as, yes,</v>

225
00:09:30.058 --> 00:09:32.678
and it's at a time when so many people,

226
00:09:32.678 --> 00:09:34.078
on one hand, you have this beautiful

227
00:09:34.078 --> 00:09:35.978
awakening happening with many.

228
00:09:35.978 --> 00:09:39.728
But on the other, almost equal and opposite to that,

229
00:09:39.728 --> 00:09:42.438
is this fatigue and wariness within

230
00:09:42.438 --> 00:09:45.418
the human population of having been

231
00:09:46.328 --> 00:09:49.258
at our own hand, and also at the hand

232
00:09:49.258 --> 00:09:51.048
of culture at large.

233
00:09:51.048 --> 00:09:53.228
Beating ourselves down into almost

234
00:09:53.228 --> 00:09:57.788
a slave type of mentality of victimization.

235
00:09:57.788 --> 00:10:00.728
<v ->Yes, but no one is a victim.</v>

236
00:10:00.728 --> 00:10:02.928
You have all chosen to be incarnate

237
00:10:02.928 --> 00:10:04.790
in this time, which is exquisite.

238
00:10:05.948 --> 00:10:08.518
And if you could see yourselves as we see you,

239
00:10:08.518 --> 00:10:11.438
there would be no discontent.

240
00:10:11.438 --> 00:10:13.638
<v Voiceover>Can you explain what you see us as?</v>

241
00:10:13.638 --> 00:10:17.518
<v ->We see the light being, the divine beings that you are.</v>

242
00:10:17.518 --> 00:10:20.255
Choosing to have an experience in the earthly plain,

243
00:10:20.255 --> 00:10:22.778
which is an emotional learning process.

244
00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:25.879
But a coming together of like mindedness

245
00:10:25.879 --> 00:10:27.979
and with technology as you know it

246
00:10:27.979 --> 00:10:31.509
and the expansion of that, which will continue,

247
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:35.049
there's a voice and a dialogue that allows

248
00:10:35.049 --> 00:10:37.589
for each of you to know the other.

249
00:10:37.589 --> 00:10:41.659
Whether one lives next door

250
00:10:41.659 --> 00:10:44.399
or across the world, in another place,

251
00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:48.339
you can see that the human species

252
00:10:48.339 --> 00:10:49.959
is one.

253
00:10:49.959 --> 00:10:52.899
With all the dreams and desires each of you have,

254
00:10:52.899 --> 00:10:54.726
and the desire of

255
00:10:54.726 --> 00:10:56.139
love.

256
00:10:56.139 --> 00:10:57.879
To be fulfilled.

257
00:10:57.879 --> 00:11:00.439
To have peace in your hearts.

258
00:11:00.439 --> 00:11:04.829
To have a family structure of great peace and love.

259
00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:08.999
That is the bottom experience of human beings.

260
00:11:08.999 --> 00:11:11.339
Wanting that belonging.

261
00:11:11.339 --> 00:11:12.199
That love.

262
00:11:12.199 --> 00:11:14.339
But first, the self-love,

263
00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:16.699
and that worthiness aspect of it.

264
00:11:16.699 --> 00:11:21.001
Recognizing that, yes, you are divine.

265
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.189
You are the resonance of God embodied.

266
00:11:26.189 --> 00:11:27.169
Yes?

267
00:11:27.169 --> 00:11:28.739
<v Voiceover>Yes and is it,</v>

268
00:11:28.739 --> 00:11:32.909
just for the sake of using a common vernacular here,

269
00:11:32.909 --> 00:11:37.489
to say that this is the time that the human portion,

270
00:11:37.489 --> 00:11:40.539
the conscious mind, or the more animal portion

271
00:11:40.539 --> 00:11:42.299
of our mind, that's very highly developed,

272
00:11:42.299 --> 00:11:45.449
as our conscious left side of the brain, so to speak,

273
00:11:45.449 --> 00:11:48.719
is beginning to open up to the recognition of,

274
00:11:48.719 --> 00:11:52.509
and allow communication with the sole portion of our being?

275
00:11:52.509 --> 00:11:54.339
That beautiful light that you see?

276
00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:55.159
<v ->Yes.</v>

277
00:11:55.159 --> 00:11:56.220
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->It's that</v>

278
00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.078
opportunity of that remembering.

279
00:12:01.859 --> 00:12:06.569
And so, there are many challenges within that.

280
00:12:06.569 --> 00:12:08.987
For it requires one

281
00:12:08.987 --> 00:12:12.719
to step out of the mode of thought,

282
00:12:12.719 --> 00:12:14.325
that you are a victim.

283
00:12:15.259 --> 00:12:17.419
And into the empowered thought

284
00:12:17.419 --> 00:12:19.789
or the causal realm energetically,

285
00:12:19.789 --> 00:12:21.861
that you are the creator.

286
00:12:23.259 --> 00:12:24.220
Which you are.

287
00:12:25.299 --> 00:12:27.239
<v Voiceover>Indeed and yet,</v>

288
00:12:27.239 --> 00:12:30.239
where we have been for many thousands of years now,

289
00:12:30.239 --> 00:12:33.569
is that the muscle of the left side of the brain,

290
00:12:33.569 --> 00:12:35.999
that has a great need to control.

291
00:12:35.999 --> 00:12:39.369
And not allowing the percolation of this finer

292
00:12:39.369 --> 00:12:42.239
feelingness and finer knowledge of self

293
00:12:42.239 --> 00:12:44.799
to percolate through.

294
00:12:44.799 --> 00:12:47.549
It's almost like an overdeveloped muscle.

295
00:12:47.549 --> 00:12:48.619
<v ->It is.</v>

296
00:12:48.619 --> 00:12:51.097
The intellectual mind has given

297
00:12:51.097 --> 00:12:53.489
free reign to itself.

298
00:12:53.489 --> 00:12:56.079
And it truly is a problem solver.

299
00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:58.739
That's it's job, so give it a job.

300
00:12:58.739 --> 00:13:01.389
Give it a problem to solve and get out of the way.

301
00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:02.279
Yes?
<v Voiceover>(chuckling)</v>

302
00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:04.469
Is this med, is this like what you say the process

303
00:13:04.469 --> 00:13:05.649
of meditation would be,

304
00:13:05.649 --> 00:13:08.299
where we have a, say you have a picture, a thought,

305
00:13:08.299 --> 00:13:10.939
or a mantra, something to give the mind to focus on

306
00:13:10.939 --> 00:13:12.939
while the other does something else?

307
00:13:12.939 --> 00:13:14.289
<v ->Yes.</v>

308
00:13:14.289 --> 00:13:16.509
That then there is that openness,

309
00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:19.349
that then you are breathing into their heart,

310
00:13:19.349 --> 00:13:21.897
which is where the soul lies,

311
00:13:21.897 --> 00:13:24.992
and that is the true center, you see.

312
00:13:25.986 --> 00:13:27.906
So you go from the heart to the head

313
00:13:27.906 --> 00:13:30.256
as many speak about.

314
00:13:30.256 --> 00:13:32.246
But in actuality, what you're doing,

315
00:13:32.246 --> 00:13:35.266
is opening that resonance

316
00:13:35.266 --> 00:13:37.246
of the soul,

317
00:13:37.246 --> 00:13:38.726
to have a voice.

318
00:13:38.726 --> 00:13:39.886
<v Voiceover>Can you speak about this</v>

319
00:13:39.886 --> 00:13:41.576
in a very nuts and bolts fashion,

320
00:13:41.576 --> 00:13:43.386
about the actual breathing?

321
00:13:43.386 --> 00:13:44.806
Because this does come up.

322
00:13:44.806 --> 00:13:49.027
The whole notion of having a spine that is straight.

323
00:13:49.027 --> 00:13:53.186
And with intention, breathing between the heart

324
00:13:53.186 --> 00:13:55.966
and the higher part of our being, into the soul,

325
00:13:55.966 --> 00:13:58.636
can you talk a little bit about how one would

326
00:13:58.636 --> 00:14:01.266
kind of easily start this process for themselves?

327
00:14:01.266 --> 00:14:04.336
<v ->It is to pay attention to the breathing, as it were.</v>

328
00:14:04.336 --> 00:14:07.246
To breathe in deeply and exhaling completely.

329
00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:09.086
And as you breathe in,

330
00:14:09.086 --> 00:14:12.086
begin to feel

331
00:14:12.086 --> 00:14:14.084
the oxygenation of the cells.

332
00:14:15.046 --> 00:14:18.426
So there is that connectivity,

333
00:14:18.426 --> 00:14:21.136
that awareness.

334
00:14:21.136 --> 00:14:23.006
Breathing in and out.

335
00:14:23.006 --> 00:14:27.668
Most often, if beings are in thought process,

336
00:14:27.668 --> 00:14:30.446
intellectually, they do not breathe properly.

337
00:14:30.446 --> 00:14:31.126
<v Voiceover>True.</v>

338
00:14:31.126 --> 00:14:33.476
<v ->They breathe enough to stay alive,</v>

339
00:14:33.476 --> 00:14:36.626
but they do not have the depth breadth,

340
00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:40.106
that feeds the cells of the body.

341
00:14:40.106 --> 00:14:44.026
Oxygenazation is very important for health.

342
00:14:44.896 --> 00:14:45.567
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

343
00:14:45.567 --> 00:14:48.389
<v ->So breathing deeply,</v>

344
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:50.767
oxygenating the system,

345
00:14:50.767 --> 00:14:54.487
on all levels of cellular structure,

346
00:14:54.487 --> 00:14:58.806
no illness or disease can live within oxygen.

347
00:15:00.076 --> 00:15:01.606
<v Voiceover>And that, that's beautiful.</v>

348
00:15:01.606 --> 00:15:02.856
Thank you.

349
00:15:02.856 --> 00:15:04.196
And in addition I'm,

350
00:15:04.196 --> 00:15:07.136
as you're talking, I'm doing this very thing,

351
00:15:07.136 --> 00:15:09.546
and you can feel the tingling that happens.

352
00:15:09.546 --> 00:15:11.536
But what I'm sensing,

353
00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:13.996
is that this other field of us,

354
00:15:13.996 --> 00:15:16.566
that animates the cells, that lives between the cells

355
00:15:16.566 --> 00:15:18.946
of the body, that soul portion,

356
00:15:18.946 --> 00:15:21.806
some kind of different communication

357
00:15:21.806 --> 00:15:24.366
feels like it begins happening

358
00:15:24.366 --> 00:15:26.267
with the oxygenation of the cells.

359
00:15:26.267 --> 00:15:28.047
Can you explain what's really going on

360
00:15:28.047 --> 00:15:30.357
between the soul force and the

361
00:15:30.357 --> 00:15:33.997
electrical part of our being, and these cells?

362
00:15:33.997 --> 00:15:36.487
<v ->What occurs when you are breathing properly,</v>

363
00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:40.656
feeding the body, as it were, yes,

364
00:15:41.778 --> 00:15:44.488
that allows a calming

365
00:15:44.488 --> 00:15:46.292
of the mind.

366
00:15:46.292 --> 00:15:49.218
It allows the calming of the musculature,

367
00:15:49.218 --> 00:15:52.409
and it allows for presence,

368
00:15:54.039 --> 00:15:58.569
an awareness on all levels where, there it is,

369
00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:02.613
exterior or interior.

370
00:16:02.613 --> 00:16:05.603
That presence is an awareness that

371
00:16:05.603 --> 00:16:07.943
permeates all that is.

372
00:16:07.943 --> 00:16:11.443
And so, when one comes into contact

373
00:16:11.443 --> 00:16:13.303
with the higher self, the soul,

374
00:16:13.303 --> 00:16:16.863
whatever you wish to speak of it as,

375
00:16:16.863 --> 00:16:20.823
and there's an open receptivity to information

376
00:16:20.823 --> 00:16:24.783
that can be achieved in your conscious state.

377
00:16:25.743 --> 00:16:29.184
So what occurs in this time,

378
00:16:29.184 --> 00:16:31.944
through that relaxation,

379
00:16:31.944 --> 00:16:33.845
through that calming,

380
00:16:33.845 --> 00:16:37.530
your sensory preceptors become quite acute.

381
00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:43.004
So you have your physical sensory preceptors,

382
00:16:43.004 --> 00:16:45.334
your solar plexus,

383
00:16:45.334 --> 00:16:49.590
you have your auditory receptors on the inner mind hearing,

384
00:16:51.064 --> 00:16:53.066
become more acute,

385
00:16:53.066 --> 00:16:56.895
and you are primed and ready for guidance.

386
00:16:58.156 --> 00:17:00.793
And awareness and remembrance to occur.

387
00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:02.846
<v Voiceover>Beautifully said.</v>

388
00:17:02.846 --> 00:17:03.826
Thank you.

389
00:17:03.826 --> 00:17:07.996
And what happens if we also add the layer of intention,

390
00:17:07.996 --> 00:17:11.136
that it is our deepest desire to know ourselves,

391
00:17:12.076 --> 00:17:13.566
through this process of breathing?

392
00:17:13.566 --> 00:17:16.426
Does it help to set that intention in advance?

393
00:17:16.426 --> 00:17:17.936
<v ->It does.</v>

394
00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:20.266
And then allow it to unfold.

395
00:17:20.266 --> 00:17:24.746
If you continue to be in the thought process of it,

396
00:17:24.746 --> 00:17:26.529
then you are resisting.

397
00:17:27.666 --> 00:17:29.186
So let go.

398
00:17:29.186 --> 00:17:31.346
Place intention

399
00:17:31.346 --> 00:17:32.647
and release it.

400
00:17:34.196 --> 00:17:37.276
And pay attention

401
00:17:37.276 --> 00:17:39.466
as it unfolds.

402
00:17:39.466 --> 00:17:41.596
It's nothing that is forced.

403
00:17:42.866 --> 00:17:44.706
It is a practice well done,

404
00:17:44.706 --> 00:17:46.686
because some will be so rigid

405
00:17:46.686 --> 00:17:49.066
in their intellectual prowess,

406
00:17:49.066 --> 00:17:51.406
that it will be difficult to release the

407
00:17:52.256 --> 00:17:55.136
intelligence or intellect,

408
00:17:55.136 --> 00:17:57.257
that wishes to control all things.

409
00:17:58.986 --> 00:18:01.796
So it may take a bit of time,

410
00:18:01.796 --> 00:18:04.724
in the practice of meditation,

411
00:18:05.816 --> 00:18:06.985
for that allowance.

412
00:18:08.056 --> 00:18:10.708
But being habitual about it,

413
00:18:10.708 --> 00:18:12.448
on a daily basis,

414
00:18:13.502 --> 00:18:16.622
allows that, hmmm,

415
00:18:16.622 --> 00:18:19.307
rigidity and restrictiveness

416
00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:20.406
to be eased.

417
00:18:22.093 --> 00:18:24.063
And it will come, no doubt.

418
00:18:25.013 --> 00:18:26.222
<v Voiceover>And in truth,</v>

419
00:18:26.222 --> 00:18:28.702
(clears throat) excuse me, and in truth,

420
00:18:28.702 --> 00:18:31.159
virtually every

421
00:18:31.159 --> 00:18:34.102
historic and ancient practice,

422
00:18:34.102 --> 00:18:36.102
as you say of the masters,

423
00:18:36.102 --> 00:18:38.202
involves the awareness of their own breath.

424
00:18:38.202 --> 00:18:40.712
That seems to be where everything begins.

425
00:18:40.712 --> 00:18:41.912
<v ->It does, yes.</v>

426
00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:45.742
For that is the breath of life, is it not?

427
00:18:45.742 --> 00:18:47.043
<v Voiceover>Mmmhmm.</v>

428
00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:50.492
So that's beautiful, it's simple, it's achievable.

429
00:18:51.912 --> 00:18:53.762
There's not a person on the planet

430
00:18:53.762 --> 00:18:56.382
who can't understand this and have something

431
00:18:56.382 --> 00:18:58.492
to begin working with, starting right now.

432
00:18:58.492 --> 00:18:59.182
<v ->Yes.</v>

433
00:18:59.182 --> 00:19:01.952
And it is the most natural thing,

434
00:19:01.952 --> 00:19:03.422
for human being,

435
00:19:03.422 --> 00:19:06.182
to achieve a meditative state.

436
00:19:06.182 --> 00:19:07.742
It is very natural.

437
00:19:07.742 --> 00:19:08.824
Many are afraid of it,

438
00:19:08.824 --> 00:19:11.124
that it's something that they don't know how to do

439
00:19:11.124 --> 00:19:13.164
and they're going to do it wrong.

440
00:19:13.164 --> 00:19:15.474
Or they can't achieve it,

441
00:19:15.474 --> 00:19:17.394
but if they have other looked out a window

442
00:19:17.394 --> 00:19:19.401
and lost time in space,

443
00:19:20.484 --> 00:19:23.144
in which you would call the daydream,

444
00:19:23.144 --> 00:19:26.244
that it is a meditative state, is it not?

445
00:19:26.244 --> 00:19:27.444
<v Voiceover>Mmhmm, yes.</v>

446
00:19:27.444 --> 00:19:29.914
<v ->So remember, that it is natural.</v>

447
00:19:30.894 --> 00:19:34.014
Very natural to the beingness of the human.

448
00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:36.764
<v Voiceover>And you can feel it</v>

449
00:19:36.764 --> 00:19:37.744
from the first breath.

450
00:19:37.744 --> 00:19:39.108
You can feel what's happening

451
00:19:39.108 --> 00:19:41.138
in the cells of the body.

452
00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:42.324
Or I do anyway.

453
00:19:42.324 --> 00:19:44.284
I'm assuming a great number of people do,

454
00:19:44.284 --> 00:19:45.644
that have done this in the past,

455
00:19:45.644 --> 00:19:48.064
and will be beginning this practice as of

456
00:19:48.064 --> 00:19:49.024
today.
<v THEO>Yes.</v>

457
00:19:49.024 --> 00:19:51.384
But it is important for them to know

458
00:19:51.384 --> 00:19:53.064
that there's no wrong way.

459
00:19:53.064 --> 00:19:54.234
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

460
00:19:54.234 --> 00:19:57.174
And that the energy surrounding us,

461
00:19:57.174 --> 00:19:59.284
the cosmic influences that are

462
00:19:59.284 --> 00:20:03.101
waving into our solar system and through our planet,

463
00:20:03.101 --> 00:20:05.719
are supporting our doing this.

464
00:20:05.719 --> 00:20:08.949
They're supporting this connection with self.

465
00:20:08.949 --> 00:20:13.419
They're demanding, almost, this connection with self.

466
00:20:13.419 --> 00:20:15.299
<v ->Yes, and those who resist it,</v>

467
00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:17.939
will have more difficulty than those

468
00:20:17.939 --> 00:20:19.380
who accept it.

469
00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.380
<v Voiceover>Can you tell me what</v>

470
00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.009
that looks like energetically, as well?

471
00:20:23.009 --> 00:20:26.069
We're looking at the beautiful possibility,

472
00:20:26.069 --> 00:20:29.839
and very achievable reality here,

473
00:20:29.839 --> 00:20:31.441
through breath, through,

474
00:20:31.441 --> 00:20:33.601
choosing this relationship with self

475
00:20:33.601 --> 00:20:35.761
that's connected to all else.

476
00:20:35.761 --> 00:20:37.851
What happen, what does it look like

477
00:20:37.851 --> 00:20:39.281
from your dimension,

478
00:20:39.281 --> 00:20:41.301
when you're seeing people that are

479
00:20:41.301 --> 00:20:43.751
going through this resistance process

480
00:20:43.751 --> 00:20:45.941
because life doesn't look like it did before?

481
00:20:45.941 --> 00:20:48.025
It doesn't feel like it did, it's pressured.

482
00:20:50.481 --> 00:20:52.801
<v ->When they are resisting,</v>

483
00:20:52.801 --> 00:20:55.811
that which they're resisting will persist.

484
00:20:55.811 --> 00:20:58.201
That role of being the victim

485
00:20:58.201 --> 00:21:00.481
will be exasperated.

486
00:21:00.481 --> 00:21:03.021
Exasperated in many ways.

487
00:21:03.021 --> 00:21:05.112
Bringing out that,

488
00:21:05.112 --> 00:21:09.211
which is very uncomfortable.

489
00:21:09.211 --> 00:21:12.352
Rather than embracing the possibility of change,

490
00:21:13.571 --> 00:21:17.521
allowing to step from that ledge, if you would,

491
00:21:19.021 --> 00:21:20.492
that one foot off,

492
00:21:21.571 --> 00:21:23.601
there will be wings to carry them,

493
00:21:23.601 --> 00:21:26.111
to allow them to fly.

494
00:21:26.111 --> 00:21:29.001
But it is taking that first step

495
00:21:29.001 --> 00:21:33.511
that is the most difficult for those who resist change.

496
00:21:35.911 --> 00:21:38.241
And some will leave the planet.

497
00:21:38.241 --> 00:21:38.871
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

498
00:21:38.871 --> 00:21:40.941
<v ->For it will be too difficult for them,</v>

499
00:21:40.941 --> 00:21:42.941
and they will create circumstances

500
00:21:42.941 --> 00:21:44.232
for that to occur.

501
00:21:45.361 --> 00:21:47.561
But those who embrace

502
00:21:47.561 --> 00:21:49.941
all these possibilities

503
00:21:49.941 --> 00:21:51.961
of that fulfillment,

504
00:21:51.961 --> 00:21:53.509
and say yes

505
00:21:54.618 --> 00:21:56.505
to the experience of it,

506
00:21:58.432 --> 00:21:59.951
they will soar.

507
00:22:01.101 --> 00:22:02.902
<v Voiceover>Beyond anything they've known.</v>

508
00:22:02.902 --> 00:22:03.662
<v ->Correct.</v>

509
00:22:03.662 --> 00:22:04.982
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

510
00:22:06.502 --> 00:22:09.041
There, I spoke with a man who is an

511
00:22:09.041 --> 00:22:10.795
Aramaic's scholar

512
00:22:10.795 --> 00:22:12.442
about a year ago,

513
00:22:12.442 --> 00:22:15.581
named Rocco Errico,

514
00:22:15.581 --> 00:22:18.881
and he has a very different view of Christianity,

515
00:22:18.881 --> 00:22:20.621
in that he's looking at

516
00:22:20.621 --> 00:22:23.831
what he feels are much more pure translations.

517
00:22:23.831 --> 00:22:26.781
And so he translated for us the,

518
00:22:26.781 --> 00:22:30.081
what the saying in, the meek shall inherit the earth.

519
00:22:30.081 --> 00:22:31.231
And he's saying,

520
00:22:31.231 --> 00:22:35.122
that the word meek means to be flexible.

521
00:22:35.122 --> 00:22:37.811
To be able to flow with change.

522
00:22:38.901 --> 00:22:40.462
<v ->It does not mean weak.</v>

523
00:22:40.462 --> 00:22:42.222
<v Voiceover>It does not mean weak?</v>

524
00:22:42.222 --> 00:22:45.402
<v ->It also has the essence of humility.</v>

525
00:22:45.402 --> 00:22:47.902
For one coming into the fulfillment

526
00:22:47.902 --> 00:22:50.102
of the master that they are,

527
00:22:51.202 --> 00:22:54.222
are not egocentric and self-centered.

528
00:22:54.222 --> 00:22:55.762
They're centered in self.

529
00:22:55.762 --> 00:22:59.132
And there's a resonance of peace within,

530
00:22:59.132 --> 00:23:03.082
that radiates out as peace without.

531
00:23:03.082 --> 00:23:06.352
So those who that are about the beings,

532
00:23:06.352 --> 00:23:10.522
that have fully accepted this within themselves,

533
00:23:10.522 --> 00:23:12.746
will wish to be with Him.

534
00:23:12.746 --> 00:23:17.343
Because the energy is so peaceful,

535
00:23:17.343 --> 00:23:20.422
and that is what brings peace to your world.

536
00:23:20.422 --> 00:23:24.303
If all beings took the responsibility for this

537
00:23:24.303 --> 00:23:28.442
greater path of self-awareness,

538
00:23:29.542 --> 00:23:31.282
as centered in selfness.

539
00:23:31.282 --> 00:23:32.602
Not a self-centeredness.

540
00:23:32.602 --> 00:23:35.322
A centered in soulness,

541
00:23:35.322 --> 00:23:37.254
that pure radiance

542
00:23:38.324 --> 00:23:40.788
of that God-divine self

543
00:23:40.788 --> 00:23:42.528
that you are,

544
00:23:42.528 --> 00:23:44.768
radiating out into the world,

545
00:23:44.768 --> 00:23:46.328
one into the other,

546
00:23:46.328 --> 00:23:47.588
all would be in peace.

547
00:23:49.208 --> 00:23:53.049
And judgement would be relinquished.

548
00:23:53.049 --> 00:23:55.569
For it is the judgments that hold

549
00:23:55.569 --> 00:23:59.408
and the angers, because of judgments and fears.

550
00:23:59.408 --> 00:24:01.458
When there's no fear,

551
00:24:01.458 --> 00:24:03.308
there can be peace, yes?

552
00:24:03.308 --> 00:24:04.128
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

553
00:24:04.128 --> 00:24:06.838
<v ->And education is a part of that.</v>

554
00:24:06.838 --> 00:24:09.338
And that is where your technology

555
00:24:09.338 --> 00:24:11.768
will bring about the education

556
00:24:11.768 --> 00:24:13.266
one unto the other.

557
00:24:14.268 --> 00:24:18.604
And when one is aware and educated and understands,

558
00:24:19.618 --> 00:24:21.604
then fear cannot exist.

559
00:24:23.138 --> 00:24:25.080
<v Voiceover>And part of this fear exists</v>

560
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.560
and has existed for so long, because also,

561
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.910
this physical human aspect of ourselves,

562
00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:35.480
is, the body has been mortal.

563
00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.170
Or considered to be or believed to be.

564
00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.760
I know you have said that death is a choice,

565
00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.000
it's an option.

566
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.100
But up to this time,

567
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.800
we have not seen that as an option.

568
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.100
We've seen it as an absolute.

569
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.921
And so the animal fears for it's own survival.

570
00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.920
And now, we're talking about an integration

571
00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.698
and understanding of a part

572
00:24:57.698 --> 00:24:59.818
that transcends all of that.

573
00:25:01.005 --> 00:25:04.340
And where in this mix,

574
00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.290
it seems the conundrum is in

575
00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:10.630
allowing ourselves to be comfortable with the notion.

576
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:13.430
That even if this body does go away,

577
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.280
that's not the end of us.

578
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.310
And if we choose not to have the body go away,

579
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.320
then there are other repercussions of dealing

580
00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.560
with a very extended lifespan.

581
00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.271
Can you speak about that conundrum?

582
00:25:24.271 --> 00:25:26.140
'Cause it's the fear of going away

583
00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.680
and not wanting to be apart from our people,

584
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.060
that everyone seems to have to graffle with.

585
00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.240
Survival.

586
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.080
<v ->Yes.</v>

587
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.080
And the greater fear's abandonment.

588
00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:37.743
For humans are animals, yes?

589
00:25:37.743 --> 00:25:38.400
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

590
00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.220
<v ->And they're herd animals.</v>

591
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.198
They wish to be significant and to belong.

592
00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.590
And so many of the issues

593
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:48.330
on the emotional level,

594
00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:51.130
about worthiness and lovableness

595
00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:54.152
than acceptability,

596
00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:56.850
come from beliefs of not being that.

597
00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:00.090
And adopting beliefs that are not your own,

598
00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:02.220
to survive in the environment

599
00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.233
in which you want to belong.

600
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.661
Whether it be a family, a community, a religion,

601
00:26:10.151 --> 00:26:11.504
a relationship.

602
00:26:12.491 --> 00:26:15.911
And we have seen one's personal essence

603
00:26:15.911 --> 00:26:17.931
for acceptance, yes?

604
00:26:17.931 --> 00:26:18.831
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

605
00:26:18.831 --> 00:26:20.771
<v ->In this time,</v>

606
00:26:20.771 --> 00:26:23.554
it is an awareness of self-acceptance,

607
00:26:24.553 --> 00:26:25.678
self-love,

608
00:26:25.678 --> 00:26:29.593
that has been spoken about by many master teachers

609
00:26:29.593 --> 00:26:33.290
for thousands of years, yes?

610
00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:37.383
The loving of self is the core,

611
00:26:37.383 --> 00:26:41.053
and many think in terms of egotism

612
00:26:41.053 --> 00:26:42.933
and narcissism.

613
00:26:42.933 --> 00:26:44.873
We are not speaking of this.

614
00:26:44.873 --> 00:26:46.653
What we are speaking of

615
00:26:46.653 --> 00:26:48.853
is that peace and self-acceptance

616
00:26:48.853 --> 00:26:50.158
and that radiance.

617
00:26:51.533 --> 00:26:52.693
Do you see?

618
00:26:52.693 --> 00:26:53.413
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

619
00:26:53.413 --> 00:26:55.894
And then, within that,

620
00:26:55.894 --> 00:26:59.313
does that begin moving human beings

621
00:26:59.313 --> 00:27:03.633
beyond the fear of death of the physical structure?

622
00:27:03.633 --> 00:27:05.733
<v ->When there is that acceptance,</v>

623
00:27:05.733 --> 00:27:07.053
there is no fear.

624
00:27:07.943 --> 00:27:09.863
For there is a connectivity

625
00:27:09.863 --> 00:27:11.313
to all that is.

626
00:27:11.313 --> 00:27:11.933
<v ->[Voiceover[ Yes.</v>

627
00:27:11.933 --> 00:27:14.398
<v ->And an awareness that you are only</v>

628
00:27:15.373 --> 00:27:19.273
inhabiting a physical structure for a period of time,

629
00:27:19.273 --> 00:27:21.513
for a particular learning,

630
00:27:21.513 --> 00:27:23.643
that the soul desires to have.

631
00:27:24.763 --> 00:27:27.713
And so, then when one knows that,

632
00:27:27.713 --> 00:27:30.663
that soul that you are,

633
00:27:30.663 --> 00:27:33.384
that essence of who you are,

634
00:27:33.384 --> 00:27:34.375
is a continuum.

635
00:27:34.375 --> 00:27:35.654
It is eternal.

636
00:27:37.464 --> 00:27:40.060
It is only form that changes.

637
00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.630
However, in this time, as you are speaking about,

638
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.550
the physical and the imbalances there,

639
00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:48.010
as beings do their internal work

640
00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:50.580
and come into the wholeness of their being,

641
00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.410
the energy flows within the body

642
00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:55.590
on the cellular level to it's perfection.

643
00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:00.410
And then, there is a process of youthening

644
00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.120
or non-aging.

645
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:05.274
Because there's no resistance

646
00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.870
in the cells.

647
00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:09.610
Energetically.

648
00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.850
Because all emotional imbalances

649
00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:14.660
held in the body on a cellular level

650
00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.751
and in those areas that would be predisposed

651
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:22.421
to illness or disease.

652
00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:25.772
Then all that energy is a block,

653
00:28:25.772 --> 00:28:29.481
where that energy blocks, then it festers.

654
00:28:31.502 --> 00:28:34.152
And becomes something that you do not want, yes?

655
00:28:34.152 --> 00:28:35.942
<v Voiceover>Mmhmm.</v>

656
00:28:35.942 --> 00:28:38.952
And so I see, I understand what you're saying

657
00:28:38.952 --> 00:28:41.072
about when we go into this place of grace,

658
00:28:41.072 --> 00:28:43.582
of self-acceptance and genuine

659
00:28:43.582 --> 00:28:46.062
love of our own selves,

660
00:28:46.062 --> 00:28:50.442
where this begins softening those energy blockages.

661
00:28:50.442 --> 00:28:52.932
And then we look at immortality.

662
00:28:52.932 --> 00:28:55.302
There are some other interesting nuances.

663
00:28:55.302 --> 00:28:58.052
We're now in one foot in one,

664
00:28:58.052 --> 00:29:00.472
the old paradigm, ready to let go of that,

665
00:29:00.472 --> 00:29:03.202
having stepped into the new.

666
00:29:03.202 --> 00:29:05.952
And in this graciousness that occurs,

667
00:29:05.952 --> 00:29:08.072
we are looking at, as you say,

668
00:29:08.072 --> 00:29:11.703
longer lifespans, much longer lifespans.

669
00:29:11.703 --> 00:29:13.632
And so then the notion of coming in

670
00:29:13.632 --> 00:29:16.892
for a lesson that may last 70 or 80 years,

671
00:29:16.892 --> 00:29:19.132
or in some cases, 40 or 50 years,

672
00:29:19.132 --> 00:29:20.962
before we leave the body,

673
00:29:20.962 --> 00:29:23.752
we can inhabit the body for over a 100 years

674
00:29:23.752 --> 00:29:25.299
and then beyond that.

675
00:29:26.432 --> 00:29:27.432
And what, and--

676
00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:29.632
<v ->And many are, as we speak, yes?</v>

677
00:29:29.632 --> 00:29:30.852
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

678
00:29:30.852 --> 00:29:33.642
And that brings up,

679
00:29:33.642 --> 00:29:36.342
of course we need to have peace with the body.

680
00:29:36.342 --> 00:29:37.672
I mean, that can't happen unless we're

681
00:29:37.672 --> 00:29:39.572
in peace with the body to begin with, right?

682
00:29:39.572 --> 00:29:42.394
Unless we're an internal congruity.

683
00:29:42.394 --> 00:29:45.102
That's what allows for the extended lifespans to

684
00:29:45.102 --> 00:29:46.592
begin with.
<v THEO>Yes.</v>

685
00:29:46.592 --> 00:29:49.302
<v  Voiceover>And this will be common</v>

686
00:29:49.302 --> 00:29:50.722
as I understand it,

687
00:29:50.722 --> 00:29:51.752
as we--
<v THEO>It's becoming</v>

688
00:29:51.752 --> 00:29:53.192
more common, as we speak.

689
00:29:53.192 --> 00:29:55.052
<v Voiceover>If we look 100 or 200 years</v>

690
00:29:55.052 --> 00:29:57.312
down the road, Earth time,

691
00:29:57.312 --> 00:29:59.622
what kind of lifespans,

692
00:29:59.622 --> 00:30:01.112
say in that near future,

693
00:30:01.112 --> 00:30:03.842
what would we be looking at ordinarily?

694
00:30:03.842 --> 00:30:05.852
<v ->150 years.</v>

695
00:30:05.852 --> 00:30:06.862
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

696
00:30:06.862 --> 00:30:07.632
<v ->Possibly.</v>

697
00:30:07.632 --> 00:30:08.572
<v Voiceover>Possibly, yes.</v>

698
00:30:08.572 --> 00:30:10.292
<v ->Not for all beings.</v>

699
00:30:10.292 --> 00:30:13.401
You've heard of many stories of a human being

700
00:30:14.492 --> 00:30:16.304
perfectly healthy,

701
00:30:17.262 --> 00:30:18.492
deciding,

702
00:30:19.622 --> 00:30:20.975
I'm complete now.

703
00:30:22.375 --> 00:30:24.626
Going to sleep and not returning.

704
00:30:24.626 --> 00:30:25.916
<v Voiceover>Mmhmm.</v>

705
00:30:25.916 --> 00:30:28.856
<v ->And perfectly at peace with that.</v>

706
00:30:28.856 --> 00:30:30.456
<v Voiceover>And that's always the soul's choice.</v>

707
00:30:30.456 --> 00:30:32.034
<v ->That is the soul's choice,</v>

708
00:30:32.034 --> 00:30:34.498
so what will be realized,

709
00:30:34.498 --> 00:30:37.599
is one does not have to create

710
00:30:37.599 --> 00:30:39.984
a devastating illness,

711
00:30:41.489 --> 00:30:43.839
to leave the body.

712
00:30:43.839 --> 00:30:46.139
When there is that heightened awareness,

713
00:30:46.139 --> 00:30:48.340
they will know of the choice.

714
00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.419
And the soul's knowing of it's completion

715
00:30:50.419 --> 00:30:53.029
of it's learning in that period of time,

716
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:55.479
will be the deciding factor.

717
00:30:56.469 --> 00:31:00.799
So, one has the possibility of longevity

718
00:31:00.799 --> 00:31:03.311
of over 100 years,

719
00:31:05.859 --> 00:31:07.241
for a faculty,

720
00:31:08.261 --> 00:31:11.121
for many fear living longer and not being themselves.

721
00:31:11.121 --> 00:31:13.331
And that does occur.

722
00:31:13.331 --> 00:31:14.755
But for faculty,

723
00:31:15.731 --> 00:31:19.703
then it is a matter of recognizing the choice,

724
00:31:19.703 --> 00:31:20.723
is it not?

725
00:31:20.723 --> 00:31:22.723
<v Voiceover>Mmhmm.</v>

726
00:31:22.723 --> 00:31:24.212
And on that subject,

727
00:31:25.953 --> 00:31:29.153
there are various texts that speak about

728
00:31:29.153 --> 00:31:31.423
the time we enter into an incarnation,

729
00:31:31.423 --> 00:31:33.603
the time we leave an incarnation.

730
00:31:33.603 --> 00:31:35.733
That the soul has it's own

731
00:31:37.603 --> 00:31:38.603
clock.

732
00:31:38.603 --> 00:31:41.163
That these decisions have been determined

733
00:31:41.163 --> 00:31:43.853
by the soul for specific purpose.

734
00:31:43.853 --> 00:31:44.823
<v ->Yes.</v>

735
00:31:44.823 --> 00:31:46.663
<v Voiceover>And I ask you about this</v>

736
00:31:46.663 --> 00:31:48.483
because so many are afraid,

737
00:31:48.483 --> 00:31:50.743
oh if I eat this, if I do this,

738
00:31:50.743 --> 00:31:53.403
I'm going to die prematurely.

739
00:31:53.403 --> 00:31:57.773
And if we can understand more deeply,

740
00:31:57.773 --> 00:32:01.283
the soul has it's own say in these

741
00:32:01.283 --> 00:32:03.313
important dates in our lives.

742
00:32:03.313 --> 00:32:05.204
Can you speak about that a little bit?

743
00:32:06.224 --> 00:32:09.003
<v ->Yes, it's important to understand,</v>

744
00:32:10.373 --> 00:32:12.623
when one's aware of what the body

745
00:32:12.623 --> 00:32:14.523
is speaking that it needs.

746
00:32:14.523 --> 00:32:18.203
Paying attention, being a health advocate,

747
00:32:18.203 --> 00:32:20.168
honoring the physical body

748
00:32:21.323 --> 00:32:22.588
is necessary.

749
00:32:23.575 --> 00:32:26.393
But not to make an intellectual choice

750
00:32:26.393 --> 00:32:30.043
about your diet that does not serve the body.

751
00:32:30.043 --> 00:32:33.403
There are many who become the vegetarians or vegan,

752
00:32:33.403 --> 00:32:35.819
because of an intellectual choice.

753
00:32:38.043 --> 00:32:41.743
And their body truly needs protein

754
00:32:41.743 --> 00:32:43.056
from an animal.

755
00:32:44.383 --> 00:32:47.635
It assimilates it based in that form.

756
00:32:49.003 --> 00:32:52.803
And so, then this body becomes malnourished

757
00:32:55.213 --> 00:32:57.976
and nonfunctional at it's optimum.

758
00:32:59.533 --> 00:33:01.123
But then there's another,

759
00:33:01.123 --> 00:33:03.423
who is better served

760
00:33:03.423 --> 00:33:05.092
by being a vegetarian.

761
00:33:06.563 --> 00:33:09.103
And it's not an intellectual choice.

762
00:33:09.103 --> 00:33:10.783
It's an awareness of what the cells

763
00:33:10.783 --> 00:33:13.433
in the body are speaking.

764
00:33:13.433 --> 00:33:17.303
And this body perfectly aligns to that

765
00:33:17.303 --> 00:33:21.343
and assimilates the nutrients necessary in each cell,

766
00:33:21.343 --> 00:33:23.012
because it's on that vibration.

767
00:33:24.243 --> 00:33:27.723
But that is necessary for the individual to be aware

768
00:33:27.723 --> 00:33:31.225
of the body itself and it's functionality.

769
00:33:32.523 --> 00:33:34.243
<v Voiceover>And that's a basic responsibility.</v>

770
00:33:34.243 --> 00:33:36.223
And then the overlay of the soul.

771
00:33:37.303 --> 00:33:40.804
Does the soul have, has the soul,

772
00:33:40.804 --> 00:33:43.124
as it comes into an incarnation,

773
00:33:43.124 --> 00:33:45.484
choosing it's gene pool, parentage,

774
00:33:45.484 --> 00:33:46.784
time of birth, and so forth,

775
00:33:46.784 --> 00:33:48.744
does it also choose it's exit?

776
00:33:49.844 --> 00:33:51.284
<v ->It does.</v>

777
00:33:51.284 --> 00:33:54.724
The soul chooses the perfect time.

778
00:33:54.724 --> 00:33:56.534
When it is complete,

779
00:33:56.534 --> 00:34:00.317
with that which it is desired to learn from

780
00:34:01.554 --> 00:34:04.964
and to encounter, you might say.

781
00:34:04.964 --> 00:34:06.594
<v Voiceover>I bring that up because there's</v>

782
00:34:06.594 --> 00:34:08.525
this mass fear of death.

783
00:34:08.525 --> 00:34:10.475
Like it's going to come and get you

784
00:34:10.475 --> 00:34:11.945
in an unexpected fashion,

785
00:34:11.945 --> 00:34:14.955
when you least expect it and least want it to occur.

786
00:34:14.955 --> 00:34:16.685
And, I mean, I don't see it that way.

787
00:34:16.685 --> 00:34:18.275
I see this as a,

788
00:34:18.275 --> 00:34:19.745
this is more an orderly process,

789
00:34:19.745 --> 00:34:21.165
like you say.

790
00:34:21.165 --> 00:34:22.265
<v ->It is.</v>

791
00:34:22.265 --> 00:34:24.125
But many are afraid of death

792
00:34:24.125 --> 00:34:27.155
and they're afraid of being in pain

793
00:34:27.155 --> 00:34:29.705
and that they would go into darkness.

794
00:34:29.705 --> 00:34:32.005
And whatever their beliefs might be,

795
00:34:33.265 --> 00:34:34.885
will be realized, you see.

796
00:34:34.885 --> 00:34:36.685
<v Voiceover>Yes, the darkness.</v>

797
00:34:36.685 --> 00:34:37.425
I think that
<v THEO>Yes.</v>

798
00:34:37.425 --> 00:34:38.945
<v Voiceover>has to be a large</v>

799
00:34:38.945 --> 00:34:42.005
component of the fear of death for people.

800
00:34:42.005 --> 00:34:44.045
<v ->And it's quite the opposite, you see.</v>

801
00:34:45.405 --> 00:34:48.025
It is a birth into a new

802
00:34:48.025 --> 00:34:50.005
energy way of being.

803
00:34:50.005 --> 00:34:50.835
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

804
00:34:50.835 --> 00:34:52.437
<v ->But it's never alone.</v>

805
00:34:53.955 --> 00:34:56.954
There are legions of angels there to greet.

806
00:34:57.945 --> 00:35:00.125
As well as loved ones.

807
00:35:00.125 --> 00:35:01.818
It is exquisite.

808
00:35:03.448 --> 00:35:05.687
And as beings,

809
00:35:05.687 --> 00:35:07.798
in their moments

810
00:35:07.798 --> 00:35:10.878
before exiting the physical structure,

811
00:35:10.878 --> 00:35:13.168
have often said to loved ones

812
00:35:13.168 --> 00:35:15.271
how exquisite it is.

813
00:35:16.668 --> 00:35:19.291
So one needs not fear.

814
00:35:19.291 --> 00:35:21.618
And most often,

815
00:35:21.618 --> 00:35:24.168
if there is this time

816
00:35:24.168 --> 00:35:28.008
where the soul goes in and out of the body,

817
00:35:29.778 --> 00:35:32.150
before the full departure,

818
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:33.352
so there is,

819
00:35:33.352 --> 00:35:35.460
(gentle laugh)

820
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.690
a bit of an experience

821
00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:39.631
to lessen the fears.

822
00:35:41.491 --> 00:35:43.501
<v Voiceover>Yes, I've seen this.</v>

823
00:35:43.501 --> 00:35:44.251
<v ->Yes.</v>

824
00:35:44.251 --> 00:35:47.105
<v Voiceover>And people think they're hallucinating.</v>

825
00:35:47.105 --> 00:35:48.177
<v ->And they are not.</v>

826
00:35:48.177 --> 00:35:49.577
<v Voiceover>No, they are not.</v>

827
00:35:51.087 --> 00:35:53.247
I wanted to first go into these

828
00:35:53.247 --> 00:35:58.037
most primal issues of our fear of our nonexistence.

829
00:35:58.037 --> 00:36:01.257
Our fear of not being good enough.

830
00:36:01.257 --> 00:36:04.237
Before we really start the 2012 conversation,

831
00:36:04.237 --> 00:36:07.147
because that is really, when it comes down to it,

832
00:36:07.147 --> 00:36:08.947
that's what everybody wants to know about.

833
00:36:08.947 --> 00:36:13.637
In themselves is, how can I elevate my own awareness?

834
00:36:13.637 --> 00:36:15.197
How can I feel better?

835
00:36:15.197 --> 00:36:18.417
How can I participate in this

836
00:36:18.417 --> 00:36:20.487
in a way that is doable?

837
00:36:20.487 --> 00:36:22.337
Because a lot of people believe

838
00:36:22.337 --> 00:36:23.717
they're not good enough, not talented enough.

839
00:36:23.717 --> 00:36:26.067
They're not spiritual enough or whatever,

840
00:36:26.067 --> 00:36:27.717
to reach into this new era,

841
00:36:27.717 --> 00:36:29.388
but in fact,

842
00:36:29.388 --> 00:36:30.947
many, many, many people

843
00:36:30.947 --> 00:36:32.637
aren't even aware of the transitions

844
00:36:32.637 --> 00:36:34.457
that have already happened within.

845
00:36:34.457 --> 00:36:36.037
Is that correct?
<v THEO>That's true.</v>

846
00:36:36.037 --> 00:36:37.437
That's true.

847
00:36:37.437 --> 00:36:39.357
<v Voiceover>And so, can we look at this now</v>

848
00:36:39.357 --> 00:36:41.197
more from a, an external,

849
00:36:41.197 --> 00:36:42.857
those are the internal components

850
00:36:42.857 --> 00:36:44.919
from an external societal point of view.

851
00:36:44.919 --> 00:36:48.789
In 20, as I mentioned at the beginning here,

852
00:36:48.789 --> 00:36:51.230
you spoke many, many years ago,

853
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:53.919
of these transitional years of 2012 to 15,

854
00:36:53.919 --> 00:36:56.460
where we were at the cracks of transition

855
00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:00.463
and you spoke, specifically, of the political and economic.

856
00:37:01.491 --> 00:37:02.120
<v ->Yes.</v>

857
00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:05.361
<v Voiceover>And the economic is at the core</v>

858
00:37:05.361 --> 00:37:08.480
of our external fears for survival.

859
00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.320
That we're going to be left

860
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.260
homeless and shivering in the cold,

861
00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:13.901
and penniless.

862
00:37:13.901 --> 00:37:15.920
Which many people have lost their jobs now,

863
00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:16.880
right now.

864
00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.260
That this time, and our,

865
00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.380
in this kind of fear.

866
00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:21.100
Can you--

867
00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.480
<v ->Yes, but it's not the true reality.</v>

868
00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.140
It's the experience of the now.

869
00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.960
That will be changing in tomorrow

870
00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.390
or the next moment.

871
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:30.370
So it's embracing that opportunity of

872
00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:33.370
what growth is here for me now.

873
00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:35.360
What are the issues?

874
00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.381
Where does my fear come from?

875
00:37:38.381 --> 00:37:40.225
What belief do I have,

876
00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:44.440
that should be reframed?

877
00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:48.420
What belief needs to be restructured,

878
00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.322
or let go of,

879
00:37:51.521 --> 00:37:54.320
to live in a greater abundance?

880
00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.960
So many are in fear because of these changes.

881
00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.460
Necessarily so.

882
00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.840
We spoke about a global economic structure

883
00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:04.660
coming into fulfillment, in this period of time.

884
00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:08.040
And what you born witness to,

885
00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.122
in your world,

886
00:38:09.122 --> 00:38:12.122
is the collapse of the global economy.

887
00:38:12.122 --> 00:38:12.922
Yes?

888
00:38:12.922 --> 00:38:13.862
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

889
00:38:13.862 --> 00:38:16.302
<v ->And a new one being born.</v>

890
00:38:16.302 --> 00:38:19.022
And many afraid of that.

891
00:38:19.022 --> 00:38:21.542
Holding great fear.

892
00:38:21.542 --> 00:38:24.552
And it is for the betterment of all.

893
00:38:24.552 --> 00:38:27.992
What will come, in a global way,

894
00:38:27.992 --> 00:38:32.379
is that all beings will have the opportunity

895
00:38:33.472 --> 00:38:35.132
of abundance.

896
00:38:35.132 --> 00:38:38.419
And a life lived in that abundance.

897
00:38:40.132 --> 00:38:43.622
So it is not to be controlled by one,

898
00:38:45.722 --> 00:38:49.162
but to be embraced, for it is a new paradigm,

899
00:38:49.162 --> 00:38:51.642
a new form of economy,

900
00:38:53.102 --> 00:38:56.342
that is globally-based.

901
00:38:56.342 --> 00:38:57.542
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

902
00:38:57.542 --> 00:39:00.542
<v ->And that is a necessity.</v>

903
00:39:00.542 --> 00:39:02.282
It should not be feared.

904
00:39:02.282 --> 00:39:04.882
And we spoke of this many decades ago.

905
00:39:06.262 --> 00:39:09.978
The other (gentle moan)

906
00:39:09.978 --> 00:39:11.668
is health.

907
00:39:13.368 --> 00:39:16.468
The other is political,

908
00:39:16.468 --> 00:39:19.239
for the political structures do not work.

909
00:39:21.188 --> 00:39:23.008
And new ones are being formed

910
00:39:23.008 --> 00:39:25.808
and you are bearing witness to that, as well,

911
00:39:25.808 --> 00:39:26.848
are you not?

912
00:39:26.848 --> 00:39:28.768
By the people

913
00:39:28.768 --> 00:39:33.248
speaking of, in mass,

914
00:39:33.248 --> 00:39:35.888
of wishing the freedoms

915
00:39:35.888 --> 00:39:38.754
to live a life

916
00:39:38.754 --> 00:39:40.948
of fulfillment.

917
00:39:40.948 --> 00:39:42.508
On all levels.

918
00:39:42.508 --> 00:39:44.188
Economic.

919
00:39:44.188 --> 00:39:45.488
Peace.

920
00:39:46.748 --> 00:39:48.218
Happiness.

921
00:39:48.218 --> 00:39:49.118
Love.

922
00:39:49.118 --> 00:39:49.808
Yes?

923
00:39:49.808 --> 00:39:50.928
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

924
00:39:50.928 --> 00:39:53.008
The old systems are no longer working--

925
00:39:53.008 --> 00:39:53.798
<v ->They do not work.
<v Voiceover>You have to</v>

926
00:39:53.798 --> 00:39:55.498
go through the period of collapse.

927
00:39:55.498 --> 00:39:56.808
<v ->Of course.</v>

928
00:39:56.808 --> 00:39:58.928
For the new structures to be built.

929
00:40:00.498 --> 00:40:02.428
And they are being built.

930
00:40:02.428 --> 00:40:04.208
They're just in a ground level.

931
00:40:04.208 --> 00:40:07.928
A foundation building place now.

932
00:40:09.548 --> 00:40:11.508
<v Voiceover>And THEO, this is something</v>

933
00:40:13.728 --> 00:40:15.549
Scott, my husband and I, and CMN,

934
00:40:15.549 --> 00:40:19.149
we were a conduit for the release of this.

935
00:40:19.149 --> 00:40:21.889
And as, kind of a vague announcement,

936
00:40:21.889 --> 00:40:24.869
as to what is being built underneath,

937
00:40:24.869 --> 00:40:27.889
that will be making itself visible to humans

938
00:40:27.889 --> 00:40:30.649
regarding a new economic structure.

939
00:40:32.249 --> 00:40:34.429
And from what you see energetically,

940
00:40:34.429 --> 00:40:37.329
is that part of what you were speaking of?

941
00:40:37.329 --> 00:40:39.640
<v ->Yes, it is.</v>

942
00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.900
<v Voiceover>And in this, there's something that is,</v>

943
00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.290
there's a type of,

944
00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:46.390
of course there's fear because people are seeing

945
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:49.550
the old paradigm-controlling structures of money,

946
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.690
and have great fear that this is going to be repeated,

947
00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:54.071
but just under a different guise.

948
00:40:54.971 --> 00:40:56.230
But as your're saying,

949
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:58.450
this is holy different.

950
00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:00.300
This is a holy different kind of economy

951
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.430
that is emerging.

952
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:02.100
<v ->It is.</v>

953
00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:03.490
<v Voiceover>Different players.</v>

954
00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:07.160
Or maybe even transformed players?

955
00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:07.810
<v ->Yes.</v>

956
00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:09.870
<v Voiceover>Both, okay.</v>
<v ->Both.</v>

957
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:13.160
<v ->Voiceover] And when you overlay this,</v>

958
00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:17.680
with this pulse of this energy that's coming in,

959
00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.730
thinning the veils, allowing us to

960
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:22.900
operate more from a soul perspective.

961
00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:26.400
The soul prospective, as you have stated before,

962
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.379
can operate at the speed of thought.

963
00:41:28.379 --> 00:41:30.479
It doesn't, you do not have to

964
00:41:30.479 --> 00:41:31.879
drag yourself through the gutter

965
00:41:31.879 --> 00:41:33.079
to earn a dollar.

966
00:41:33.079 --> 00:41:34.899
That is not how the soul creates.

967
00:41:34.899 --> 00:41:36.359
<v ->No.</v>

968
00:41:36.359 --> 00:41:39.580
It's a manifestational process, energetically.

969
00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:43.319
<v Voiceover>So it should come relatively effortlessly,</v>

970
00:41:43.319 --> 00:41:45.039
and with a certain amount of grace,

971
00:41:45.039 --> 00:41:47.799
and not to be depleting of our energies

972
00:41:47.799 --> 00:41:50.349
to earn a dollar any longer.

973
00:41:50.349 --> 00:41:51.220
<v ->Correct.</v>

974
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:54.099
This is occurring.

975
00:41:54.099 --> 00:41:56.273
It is being formed as we speak.

976
00:41:57.343 --> 00:41:59.164
And all can participate.

977
00:42:01.244 --> 00:42:04.789
And in this, the fear comes from the

978
00:42:04.789 --> 00:42:05.408
(soft chuckle)

979
00:42:05.408 --> 00:42:07.336
classes, you might say.

980
00:42:07.336 --> 00:42:09.824
The better than, the lesser than.

981
00:42:11.264 --> 00:42:14.816
And the beliefs about money

982
00:42:14.816 --> 00:42:16.566
must change.

983
00:42:16.566 --> 00:42:17.326
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

984
00:42:17.326 --> 00:42:19.976
<v ->For money has no energy in of in itself.</v>

985
00:42:19.976 --> 00:42:23.266
It is a belief that gives it power.

986
00:42:23.266 --> 00:42:25.206
Or those who have it, power.

987
00:42:25.206 --> 00:42:26.226
You see?

988
00:42:26.226 --> 00:42:28.846
For ones that abdicate to them.

989
00:42:30.026 --> 00:42:32.334
When one feels empowered

990
00:42:33.677 --> 00:42:35.654
and abundant,

991
00:42:35.654 --> 00:42:37.947
and it's not about how much.

992
00:42:37.947 --> 00:42:41.377
It is a feeling and a belief with it.

993
00:42:41.377 --> 00:42:45.237
There is a person in the world that could have $1,

994
00:42:45.237 --> 00:42:49.417
and feel as if they have the greatest wealth of all.

995
00:42:49.417 --> 00:42:52.347
Because it is a belief and knowingness that,

996
00:42:52.347 --> 00:42:56.677
that is their greatest abundance.

997
00:42:56.677 --> 00:42:59.331
And another would believe that they are paupers.

998
00:43:01.007 --> 00:43:01.747
Yes?

999
00:43:01.747 --> 00:43:02.487
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1000
00:43:02.487 --> 00:43:06.127
And is there an element of this where,

1001
00:43:06.127 --> 00:43:07.957
as you say, our thinking around

1002
00:43:07.957 --> 00:43:10.287
economy and money has to shift?

1003
00:43:10.287 --> 00:43:13.618
Right now, it's drilled into us from birth.

1004
00:43:13.618 --> 00:43:16.508
We must start savings account for our child.

1005
00:43:16.508 --> 00:43:17.748
We have to save, save, save.

1006
00:43:17.748 --> 00:43:20.528
And stockpile these little units of currency,

1007
00:43:20.528 --> 00:43:22.608
so that we'll be safe into our future.

1008
00:43:22.608 --> 00:43:23.848
<v ->And there's no safety.</v>

1009
00:43:23.848 --> 00:43:25.688
It's already been proven, has it not?

1010
00:43:25.688 --> 00:43:26.608
<v Voiceover>(chuckles) Yes.</v>

1011
00:43:26.608 --> 00:43:28.508
<v ->That those who saved, saved, saved,</v>

1012
00:43:28.508 --> 00:43:31.458
and had this amassed amount of money,

1013
00:43:31.458 --> 00:43:32.708
have lost it all.

1014
00:43:32.708 --> 00:43:34.228
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1015
00:43:34.228 --> 00:43:38.308
And so now we have to look at our ability, then.

1016
00:43:38.308 --> 00:43:42.468
as beings, to be able to manifest exactly

1017
00:43:42.468 --> 00:43:44.348
what we need and desire,

1018
00:43:44.348 --> 00:43:46.278
for our use in that moment.

1019
00:43:46.278 --> 00:43:47.748
<v ->Correct.</v>

1020
00:43:47.748 --> 00:43:49.078
<v Voiceover>This isn't about stockpiling.</v>

1021
00:43:49.078 --> 00:43:51.998
It's about being perpetually creative.

1022
00:43:51.998 --> 00:43:53.054
<v ->Correct.</v>

1023
00:43:54.478 --> 00:43:56.168
And those that have been,

1024
00:43:56.168 --> 00:43:57.728
feel very comfortable

1025
00:43:57.728 --> 00:44:01.408
in knowing that they have the skills to survive.

1026
00:44:01.408 --> 00:44:04.758
Because they have the awareness

1027
00:44:04.758 --> 00:44:09.028
of the manifestational experience.

1028
00:44:09.028 --> 00:44:10.508
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1029
00:44:10.508 --> 00:44:12.718
And I wanted to tie this together,

1030
00:44:12.718 --> 00:44:17.308
because this whole economic system coming in,

1031
00:44:17.308 --> 00:44:18.728
I've thought about this a lot.

1032
00:44:18.728 --> 00:44:20.448
I've been thinking about this,

1033
00:44:20.448 --> 00:44:24.602
and it's totally consistent

1034
00:44:24.602 --> 00:44:26.768
with the energy impulse.

1035
00:44:26.768 --> 00:44:29.168
With the notion of the energies coming in

1036
00:44:29.168 --> 00:44:31.698
to support our transformation in 2012.

1037
00:44:31.698 --> 00:44:33.628
Of course the systems have to be transformed

1038
00:44:33.628 --> 00:44:36.218
with us genuinely.

1039
00:44:36.218 --> 00:44:37.828
<v ->Yes, because they do not work, and it's</v>

1040
00:44:37.828 --> 00:44:38.988
(soft hum)

1041
00:44:38.988 --> 00:44:41.188
what you're seeing is old structures,

1042
00:44:41.188 --> 00:44:42.508
old buildings.

1043
00:44:42.508 --> 00:44:44.748
The pyramids.

1044
00:44:44.748 --> 00:44:46.908
The sphinxes.

1045
00:44:46.908 --> 00:44:49.258
The different structures, such as this

1046
00:44:49.258 --> 00:44:52.358
have been iconic, in the world,

1047
00:44:52.358 --> 00:44:54.768
are dissolving, as well, are they not?

1048
00:44:54.768 --> 00:44:56.758
And they are saying it is the environment

1049
00:44:56.758 --> 00:44:58.578
that is doing it.

1050
00:44:58.578 --> 00:45:01.378
But it is only, in our manifestation

1051
00:45:01.378 --> 00:45:04.728
of what is happening to all structures

1052
00:45:04.728 --> 00:45:07.560
that do not serve any longer.

1053
00:45:09.268 --> 00:45:11.189
<v Voiceover>They must crumble and pass away.</v>

1054
00:45:11.189 --> 00:45:13.808
<v ->Yes, for the new to be built.</v>

1055
00:45:15.488 --> 00:45:16.949
<v Voiceover>So now let's talk a little about</v>

1056
00:45:16.949 --> 00:45:19.029
the political situation of the world.

1057
00:45:19.029 --> 00:45:20.369
We all know what's going on.

1058
00:45:20.369 --> 00:45:22.729
There's the Occupy Wall Street, the Arab Spring,

1059
00:45:22.729 --> 00:45:24.049
the change of governments,

1060
00:45:24.049 --> 00:45:26.829
they passing away of elders, in the case of Korea,

1061
00:45:26.829 --> 00:45:29.919
a younger generation coming in to

1062
00:45:29.919 --> 00:45:31.809
now take leadership.

1063
00:45:31.809 --> 00:45:34.776
And as you're talking about this breaking down,

1064
00:45:35.799 --> 00:45:37.630
we still have this game of elections,

1065
00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:41.340
the illusion of free elections and all this coming up.

1066
00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.870
What will this break down actually look like

1067
00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:46.390
before the system will simply get out of our way,

1068
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:49.090
so people can recreate something better?

1069
00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:52.230
<v ->It's happening as we speak.</v>

1070
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:55.470
The dissolving, the dissolution of these old paradigms

1071
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:56.725
do not work.

1072
00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:01.860
And what you're witnessing, this dissatisfaction

1073
00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:04.290
of the beings upon the planet saying,

1074
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:07.210
"These do not work. We want them to change."

1075
00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:12.102
Now there are those that, as you spoke of Occupy,

1076
00:46:13.191 --> 00:46:15.571
throughout the countries of the world,

1077
00:46:15.571 --> 00:46:19.241
you have seen this rising up of the individuals saying,

1078
00:46:19.241 --> 00:46:20.813
"This isn't working."

1079
00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:24.691
And then in some cases, being infiltrated by

1080
00:46:24.691 --> 00:46:27.771
those who wish to continue to control.

1081
00:46:27.771 --> 00:46:30.231
But all that which has been hidden,

1082
00:46:30.231 --> 00:46:32.911
all the deceptions that have been

1083
00:46:32.911 --> 00:46:35.281
bubbling to the surface.

1084
00:46:35.281 --> 00:46:37.971
Just as if there's an illness in the body.

1085
00:46:39.171 --> 00:46:40.301
A virus.

1086
00:46:41.111 --> 00:46:44.091
And then there's a fever that happens to the body

1087
00:46:44.091 --> 00:46:47.565
to burn out all of that virus

1088
00:46:47.565 --> 00:46:49.222
and release it.

1089
00:46:49.222 --> 00:46:53.013
So this is what's happening in the world, you see.

1090
00:46:53.013 --> 00:46:54.653
<v Voiceover>And when we look at it,</v>

1091
00:46:54.653 --> 00:46:56.873
if I'm looking at it right now, I'm thinking,

1092
00:46:56.873 --> 00:46:59.093
we have another election coming up,

1093
00:46:59.093 --> 00:47:00.713
with another sham.

1094
00:47:00.713 --> 00:47:04.134
It's just public relations, and fantasy spin,

1095
00:47:04.134 --> 00:47:06.714
and lying outright to the public,

1096
00:47:06.714 --> 00:47:10.104
and hiding misdeeds, and all the usual businesses,

1097
00:47:10.104 --> 00:47:11.354
business as usual.

1098
00:47:12.494 --> 00:47:13.974
How does it actually,

1099
00:47:13.974 --> 00:47:16.294
maybe you can give us a little hint of what's coming,

1100
00:47:16.294 --> 00:47:18.754
how does it just break down?

1101
00:47:18.754 --> 00:47:20.454
I mean, are we talking anarchy,

1102
00:47:20.454 --> 00:47:22.814
or are we talking something viable,

1103
00:47:22.814 --> 00:47:26.254
surprisingly rising to the surface and being supported?

1104
00:47:26.254 --> 00:47:28.644
A new kind of person or,

1105
00:47:28.644 --> 00:47:29.905
what's it look like?

1106
00:47:29.905 --> 00:47:31.233
What's this collapse going to look like.

1107
00:47:31.233 --> 00:47:34.034
<v ->A new form of electoral will occur.</v>

1108
00:47:34.034 --> 00:47:35.694
You're speaking of the country of which you live,

1109
00:47:35.694 --> 00:47:37.394
yes?
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1110
00:47:37.394 --> 00:47:41.954
<v ->A new form of voting, by all,</v>

1111
00:47:41.954 --> 00:47:44.508
will arise through technology.

1112
00:47:45.784 --> 00:47:46.694
For it's in place.

1113
00:47:46.694 --> 00:47:48.854
It can be utilized.

1114
00:47:48.854 --> 00:47:53.114
But those empowered in this system

1115
00:47:53.114 --> 00:47:56.854
of the past, do not want this.

1116
00:47:56.854 --> 00:47:58.554
<v Voiceover>Of course.</v>

1117
00:47:58.554 --> 00:48:01.414
<v ->But they will be overpowered by the people.</v>

1118
00:48:01.414 --> 00:48:03.432
Wishing to have their voice heard.

1119
00:48:04.624 --> 00:48:05.854
<v Voiceover>Now will this be by,</v>

1120
00:48:05.854 --> 00:48:08.563
right now, we're in 2012, early 2012.

1121
00:48:08.563 --> 00:48:11.313
Will this be by, maybe the next election cycle?

1122
00:48:12.553 --> 00:48:14.614
<v ->It's possible by the next, not this one.</v>

1123
00:48:14.614 --> 00:48:16.254
<v Voiceover>Not this one, no.</v>

1124
00:48:16.254 --> 00:48:17.773
This is still the old way.

1125
00:48:17.773 --> 00:48:19.254
People are not happy with it but it's still

1126
00:48:19.254 --> 00:48:20.455
the old way.
<v THEO>They're disgusted</v>

1127
00:48:20.455 --> 00:48:21.814
with it, most are.

1128
00:48:21.814 --> 00:48:24.864
And by the personalities that create

1129
00:48:24.864 --> 00:48:27.912
this old paradigm of negativity,

1130
00:48:29.754 --> 00:48:31.697
without solutions,

1131
00:48:31.697 --> 00:48:34.978
without ideas and creativity.

1132
00:48:34.978 --> 00:48:37.397
That is what you're witnessing.

1133
00:48:37.397 --> 00:48:40.997
And the need for compromise and collaboration,

1134
00:48:42.537 --> 00:48:43.708
must come,

1135
00:48:44.677 --> 00:48:45.797
as you know.

1136
00:48:45.797 --> 00:48:47.357
<v Voiceover>So we're looking at probably</v>

1137
00:48:47.357 --> 00:48:49.947
the election of 2016 or 2020.

1138
00:48:49.947 --> 00:48:51.997
And there, by then this new system

1139
00:48:51.997 --> 00:48:53.597
should have been given birth to.

1140
00:48:53.597 --> 00:48:55.317
The old one should have crumbled away.

1141
00:48:55.317 --> 00:48:56.257
<v ->Yes.</v>

1142
00:48:56.257 --> 00:48:57.537
<v Voiceover>So it's not too far out.</v>

1143
00:48:57.537 --> 00:49:00.277
But we need to have this to start creating ourselves.

1144
00:49:00.277 --> 00:49:01.917
We need this understanding,

1145
00:49:01.917 --> 00:49:03.357
so we can create the new.

1146
00:49:03.357 --> 00:49:05.927
And this is only, I assume, a reflection of

1147
00:49:05.927 --> 00:49:07.997
what's going to be happening globally.

1148
00:49:07.997 --> 00:49:09.806
<v ->It is.</v>

1149
00:49:09.806 --> 00:49:11.657
We have spoken of what would happen

1150
00:49:11.657 --> 00:49:13.417
in other parts of the world,

1151
00:49:13.417 --> 00:49:15.307
and it began in the Baltic states,

1152
00:49:15.307 --> 00:49:18.497
as we stated many decades ago.

1153
00:49:18.497 --> 00:49:21.097
But it is in the entirety of the world.

1154
00:49:21.097 --> 00:49:22.436
<v Voiceover>Yes, in the Arab world,</v>

1155
00:49:22.436 --> 00:49:25.247
with the Arab Spring and the continuing conflict

1156
00:49:25.247 --> 00:49:27.087
that goes on there.

1157
00:49:27.087 --> 00:49:29.756
Some of it has been infiltrated, we know that.

1158
00:49:30.766 --> 00:49:33.267
A lot of it is through the genuine desire

1159
00:49:33.267 --> 00:49:34.727
of the people for change.

1160
00:49:34.727 --> 00:49:35.567
<v ->Yes.</v>

1161
00:49:35.567 --> 00:49:37.127
<v Voiceover>Again if we look about 20 years</v>

1162
00:49:37.127 --> 00:49:39.767
down the road into the Arab world,

1163
00:49:39.767 --> 00:49:44.294
what is that going to look like, feel like for the people?

1164
00:49:44.294 --> 00:49:46.183
What will have been accomplished by then?

1165
00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:47.954
<v ->There will be a restructuring within this,</v>

1166
00:49:47.954 --> 00:49:49.314
because it's already begun.

1167
00:49:50.424 --> 00:49:54.004
And they have no idea of what it looks like, as yet.

1168
00:49:54.004 --> 00:49:57.485
But because of this upheaval,

1169
00:49:57.485 --> 00:49:59.235
there will come a,

1170
00:49:59.235 --> 00:50:01.185
(pondering moan)

1171
00:50:01.185 --> 00:50:03.455
a collective group

1172
00:50:04.705 --> 00:50:07.415
from the different countries,

1173
00:50:07.415 --> 00:50:09.675
or one could call them tribes, yes?

1174
00:50:10.765 --> 00:50:13.375
That will come together

1175
00:50:13.375 --> 00:50:14.595
and communicate

1176
00:50:14.595 --> 00:50:17.465
and come into an agreement that is better

1177
00:50:17.465 --> 00:50:20.035
for the whole region of the world,

1178
00:50:20.035 --> 00:50:21.795
rather than for one.

1179
00:50:23.095 --> 00:50:25.549
Because it will not serve just the one.

1180
00:50:27.695 --> 00:50:32.138
And because of the global communication,

1181
00:50:33.608 --> 00:50:36.708
they will understand that there needs to be

1182
00:50:36.708 --> 00:50:38.768
this conversation.

1183
00:50:41.258 --> 00:50:43.329
And a collective agreement.

1184
00:50:44.988 --> 00:50:48.268
They can all disagree and they can come with new ideas

1185
00:50:48.268 --> 00:50:51.248
and they can come with ideas of solutions,

1186
00:50:51.248 --> 00:50:54.308
just as it would be in the country of which you live,

1187
00:50:54.308 --> 00:50:58.078
and Europe, the dialogues will begin.

1188
00:50:58.078 --> 00:51:01.948
And there will be a global political structure,

1189
00:51:01.948 --> 00:51:04.498
much like your United Nations,

1190
00:51:04.498 --> 00:51:06.228
only a bit more powerful.

1191
00:51:06.228 --> 00:51:09.129
Not in the negative of enforcement,

1192
00:51:09.129 --> 00:51:11.738
as it has been in the past

1193
00:51:11.738 --> 00:51:12.880
(sorrowful moan)

1194
00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.292
when there's been a war,

1195
00:51:14.292 --> 00:51:18.142
but it will be more in the collective consciousness

1196
00:51:18.142 --> 00:51:20.640
and ideas, one might think

1197
00:51:21.935 --> 00:51:25.250
of as corporations do in think tanks.

1198
00:51:26.339 --> 00:51:30.061
Taking the baste of the ideas and implementing them

1199
00:51:30.061 --> 00:51:34.161
for the betterment of all, not for the control of all.

1200
00:51:35.711 --> 00:51:37.961
<v Voiceover>Mmhmm, and in this, I assume,</v>

1201
00:51:37.961 --> 00:51:41.461
there's going to be a dissolution of the European Union,

1202
00:51:43.061 --> 00:51:45.401
as it stands right now, and a restructuring

1203
00:51:45.401 --> 00:51:46.662
on another level?

1204
00:51:46.662 --> 00:51:48.701
I mean, people are talking about this.

1205
00:51:48.701 --> 00:51:51.646
I don't know if this is a reality.

1206
00:51:52.691 --> 00:51:56.151
<v ->It will not completely dissolve,</v>

1207
00:51:56.151 --> 00:51:58.881
because they have the idea necessary

1208
00:51:58.881 --> 00:52:02.541
for this collective awareness and working together.

1209
00:52:02.541 --> 00:52:05.586
It's been a bit damaged,

1210
00:52:08.871 --> 00:52:10.981
in it's conception,

1211
00:52:12.571 --> 00:52:14.581
but it will be restructured

1212
00:52:14.581 --> 00:52:16.906
in a way that will be good.

1213
00:52:19.491 --> 00:52:21.181
<v Voiceover>And, okay.</v>

1214
00:52:21.181 --> 00:52:23.541
And I just got, just made me aware.

1215
00:52:23.541 --> 00:52:25.921
We've been, I've been enjoying this talk so much,

1216
00:52:25.921 --> 00:52:27.761
I had no idea so much time has passed.

1217
00:52:27.761 --> 00:52:30.141
This has been valuable and beautiful,

1218
00:52:30.141 --> 00:52:32.341
but I have more questions, so I'm going to have to

1219
00:52:32.341 --> 00:52:34.461
do a little switch of subject here.

1220
00:52:34.461 --> 00:52:36.591
But to segue into it.

1221
00:52:36.591 --> 00:52:38.751
We're going to be looking at religions

1222
00:52:38.751 --> 00:52:42.281
of the world, softening, taking on more genuine

1223
00:52:42.281 --> 00:52:44.921
spiritual values in general, I assume.

1224
00:52:44.921 --> 00:52:47.761
The collective psyche is going to be

1225
00:52:47.761 --> 00:52:50.371
understanding our role on a different level,

1226
00:52:50.371 --> 00:52:52.882
no matter what the religious basis has been?

1227
00:52:53.871 --> 00:52:55.821
<v ->What you're talking about is dogma.</v>

1228
00:52:55.821 --> 00:52:57.061
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1229
00:52:57.061 --> 00:52:59.581
<v ->And so what is being recognized through</v>

1230
00:52:59.581 --> 00:53:01.582
this educational process,

1231
00:53:03.151 --> 00:53:06.514
again, as we spoke of, as knowledge being powerful.

1232
00:53:06.514 --> 00:53:11.104
So when one knows the truth of their religious concepts,

1233
00:53:11.104 --> 00:53:13.784
and how much alike they are,

1234
00:53:13.784 --> 00:53:15.304
there will be less fear.

1235
00:53:15.304 --> 00:53:18.544
But what you speak about is dogmatic,

1236
00:53:18.544 --> 00:53:21.554
fanatical expression.

1237
00:53:21.554 --> 00:53:22.684
<v Voiceover>In all religions.</v>

1238
00:53:22.684 --> 00:53:25.964
<v ->In all religions, not just one, but all of them.</v>

1239
00:53:27.144 --> 00:53:29.734
The true teachers of them did not

1240
00:53:29.734 --> 00:53:31.704
wish to control the masses

1241
00:53:31.704 --> 00:53:34.084
in the way the political structure

1242
00:53:34.084 --> 00:53:37.118
of religion has created.

1243
00:53:38.304 --> 00:53:40.684
Power, politics, money.

1244
00:53:42.074 --> 00:53:44.884
And so when there's knowledge of how these

1245
00:53:44.884 --> 00:53:47.364
teachers taught and the similarities

1246
00:53:47.364 --> 00:53:50.544
and the connectivity to source,

1247
00:53:50.544 --> 00:53:53.534
and the individual's divinity,

1248
00:53:53.534 --> 00:53:55.485
then it is only a recognition

1249
00:53:55.485 --> 00:53:58.325
of the different celebrations of the one,

1250
00:53:58.325 --> 00:53:59.165
is it not?

1251
00:53:59.165 --> 00:54:00.905
<v Voiceover>Mmhmm.</v>

1252
00:54:00.905 --> 00:54:03.365
<v ->And when beings are empowered</v>

1253
00:54:03.365 --> 00:54:07.425
on a soul level to have their direct connection,

1254
00:54:07.425 --> 00:54:10.064
it is only then just a gathering

1255
00:54:10.064 --> 00:54:13.064
of their community for that celebration.

1256
00:54:13.064 --> 00:54:17.378
And not the dogmatic rules and political structures

1257
00:54:18.404 --> 00:54:20.274
that will drop away.

1258
00:54:20.274 --> 00:54:22.798
<v Voiceover>And so we're looking really at more,</v>

1259
00:54:23.874 --> 00:54:27.235
genuine cultural and tribal, globally,

1260
00:54:27.235 --> 00:54:29.415
cultural and tribal celebrations.

1261
00:54:29.415 --> 00:54:31.895
Our own unique flavor and color.

1262
00:54:31.895 --> 00:54:33.065
<v ->Yes.</v>

1263
00:54:33.065 --> 00:54:33.755
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1264
00:54:33.755 --> 00:54:35.135
<v ->And without fear.</v>

1265
00:54:35.135 --> 00:54:36.615
<v Voiceover>And this is one of the fears</v>

1266
00:54:36.615 --> 00:54:38.635
people have had about globalization,

1267
00:54:38.635 --> 00:54:41.075
is that somehow, we're all wearing,

1268
00:54:41.075 --> 00:54:43.095
you know, the same suits.

1269
00:54:43.095 --> 00:54:45.395
And we're all have the same dogma,

1270
00:54:45.395 --> 00:54:46.615
and this is not true.

1271
00:54:46.615 --> 00:54:48.115
There's nothing in this that should

1272
00:54:48.115 --> 00:54:49.955
be taking away from our uniqueness

1273
00:54:49.955 --> 00:54:51.395
as cultures, is there?

1274
00:54:52.495 --> 00:54:53.240
<v ->No.</v>

1275
00:54:54.085 --> 00:54:55.675
It only makes you stronger.

1276
00:54:57.475 --> 00:55:00.075
It does not make you weaker as an individual.

1277
00:55:00.075 --> 00:55:03.775
If you own your own personal power,

1278
00:55:03.775 --> 00:55:07.835
you are aware of your full soul's essence.

1279
00:55:09.045 --> 00:55:10.975
There's the ability for vulnerability,

1280
00:55:10.975 --> 00:55:14.295
living authentically, being in your truth at all times,

1281
00:55:14.295 --> 00:55:17.775
not relinquishing your power for acceptance sake,

1282
00:55:17.775 --> 00:55:20.395
maintaining boundaries.

1283
00:55:20.395 --> 00:55:22.775
<v Voiceover>Creating abundance with ease.</v>

1284
00:55:22.775 --> 00:55:23.635
<v ->Yes.</v>

1285
00:55:24.835 --> 00:55:26.635
<v Voiceover>And so, that is a glimpse</v>

1286
00:55:26.635 --> 00:55:29.155
into what we are, in this moment,

1287
00:55:29.155 --> 00:55:31.135
creating for ourselves.

1288
00:55:31.135 --> 00:55:34.235
And we're getting a great amount of help, I assume,

1289
00:55:34.235 --> 00:55:36.575
from other beings that have been here.

1290
00:55:36.575 --> 00:55:39.255
To help us and to love us through this process.

1291
00:55:39.255 --> 00:55:41.255
And now I want to come to one final subject,

1292
00:55:41.255 --> 00:55:43.955
and that is the notion that many have

1293
00:55:43.955 --> 00:55:47.835
wondered about, it's called a formal kind of disclosure.

1294
00:55:47.835 --> 00:55:50.215
Where moving beyond interdimensional,

1295
00:55:50.215 --> 00:55:52.155
such as yourself through Sheila,

1296
00:55:52.155 --> 00:55:53.597
contact but moving into,

1297
00:55:53.597 --> 00:55:56.077
perhaps moving into other third dimensional beings,

1298
00:55:56.077 --> 00:55:59.897
in their own vehicles, with their own types of bodies.

1299
00:55:59.897 --> 00:56:02.799
You know, coming to Earth, it's called disclosure.

1300
00:56:02.799 --> 00:56:06.488
Is a type of disclosure with what we call extraterrestrials,

1301
00:56:06.488 --> 00:56:08.989
going to be happening in the near future?

1302
00:56:08.989 --> 00:56:10.139
<v ->It would.</v>

1303
00:56:10.139 --> 00:56:11.069
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1304
00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:12.419
<v ->Because there's less fear.</v>

1305
00:56:12.419 --> 00:56:13.699
Again, the education.

1306
00:56:13.699 --> 00:56:16.049
The knowledge of that possibility.

1307
00:56:16.049 --> 00:56:18.966
And that they're not malevolent.

1308
00:56:20.879 --> 00:56:23.259
That they are here and expressing.

1309
00:56:23.259 --> 00:56:25.786
And there are some in physical bodies already.

1310
00:56:27.879 --> 00:56:30.839
To experience the earthly experience.

1311
00:56:30.839 --> 00:56:31.919
If you think about it,

1312
00:56:31.919 --> 00:56:33.749
you're all aliens.

1313
00:56:33.749 --> 00:56:34.339
<v Voiceover>We are.</v>

1314
00:56:34.339 --> 00:56:35.479
And that's a very good point

1315
00:56:35.479 --> 00:56:37.549
I would love for you to continue on.

1316
00:56:37.549 --> 00:56:40.189
None of us are native to this.

1317
00:56:40.189 --> 00:56:41.198
<v ->That's correct.</v>

1318
00:56:41.198 --> 00:56:43.949
You are individual souls,

1319
00:56:43.949 --> 00:56:46.059
choosing to inhabit a physical structure

1320
00:56:46.059 --> 00:56:47.848
that works upon this earth.

1321
00:56:50.829 --> 00:56:51.875
<v Voiceover>And if it's a being</v>

1322
00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:53.415
from another place, another dimension,

1323
00:56:53.415 --> 00:56:55.035
another planet, why shouldn't they have

1324
00:56:55.035 --> 00:56:56.488
an equal right to do the same?

1325
00:56:57.485 --> 00:56:58.275
<v ->They do.</v>

1326
00:56:58.275 --> 00:56:59.235
<v Voiceover>And they do.</v>

1327
00:56:59.235 --> 00:57:00.475
<v ->And they do.
<v Voiceover>And they do.</v>

1328
00:57:00.475 --> 00:57:03.435
Yes, and many of us are them, as a matter of fact.

1329
00:57:03.435 --> 00:57:04.495
<v ->Correct.</v>

1330
00:57:04.495 --> 00:57:05.395
<v Voiceover>So we need to start getting</v>

1331
00:57:05.395 --> 00:57:07.475
comfortable with our multi-dimensionality

1332
00:57:07.475 --> 00:57:09.455
and our space brothers and sisters

1333
00:57:09.455 --> 00:57:11.295
and become more interplanetary

1334
00:57:11.295 --> 00:57:12.934
in our thinking.

1335
00:57:12.934 --> 00:57:14.615
More inviting perhaps.

1336
00:57:14.615 --> 00:57:15.245
<v ->Yes.</v>

1337
00:57:15.245 --> 00:57:16.415
<v Voiceover>THEO, any final thoughts</v>

1338
00:57:16.415 --> 00:57:17.775
you'd like to share with us,

1339
00:57:17.775 --> 00:57:19.675
with the remaining time we have?

1340
00:57:19.675 --> 00:57:21.995
<v ->It's an exquisite time</v>

1341
00:57:21.995 --> 00:57:24.716
to be alive on this planet for this

1342
00:57:24.716 --> 00:57:27.216
grand transformation of consciousness,

1343
00:57:27.216 --> 00:57:28.796
that is at hand.

1344
00:57:28.796 --> 00:57:32.026
So embrace it, do not resist it.

1345
00:57:32.026 --> 00:57:35.408
The embracing allows that fulfillment to be.

1346
00:57:38.146 --> 00:57:39.436
God's love unto you.

1347
00:57:39.436 --> 00:57:41.176
<v Voiceover>Thank you very much, THEO.</v>

1348
00:57:41.176 --> 00:57:42.076
<v ->Good day.</v>

1349
00:57:42.076 --> 00:57:43.096
<v Voiceover>Good day.</v>

1350
00:57:54.156 --> 00:57:55.636
Well.

1351
00:57:55.636 --> 00:57:56.176
<v ->Hi.</v>

1352
00:57:56.176 --> 00:57:57.276
<v Voiceover>Hi.</v>

1353
00:57:58.106 --> 00:57:59.766
That was absolutely lovely.

1354
00:57:59.766 --> 00:58:01.356
I think we touched on most of

1355
00:58:01.356 --> 00:58:04.146
the deepest subjects that we really

1356
00:58:04.146 --> 00:58:06.917
need to start contemplating as a species, Shelia.

1357
00:58:06.917 --> 00:58:07.476
I don't know

1358
00:58:07.476 --> 00:58:08.536
how much you
<v Shelia>Oh good.</v>

1359
00:58:08.536 --> 00:58:10.316
<v Voiceover>remember when you come back,</v>

1360
00:58:10.316 --> 00:58:11.816
but it was a lovely conversation with THEO.

1361
00:58:11.816 --> 00:58:12.796
Oh good, I'll be,

1362
00:58:12.796 --> 00:58:14.966
I'm looking forward to hearing it.

1363
00:58:14.966 --> 00:58:16.866
<v Voiceover>When you see it yourself.</v>

1364
00:58:17.956 --> 00:58:19.796
Just at the very end, we talked about something.

1365
00:58:19.796 --> 00:58:21.956
This great fear of the divide over the

1366
00:58:21.956 --> 00:58:23.996
types of beings and who's going to

1367
00:58:23.996 --> 00:58:25.456
have supremacy over this earth,

1368
00:58:25.456 --> 00:58:28.626
and Hollywood creating these horrible fear scenarios that,

1369
00:58:28.626 --> 00:58:31.055
you know, superpower, super beings

1370
00:58:31.055 --> 00:58:33.896
are going to come over, come into

1371
00:58:33.896 --> 00:58:35.956
our dimension, are going to invade this planet

1372
00:58:35.956 --> 00:58:38.616
and all of this B.S. and

1373
00:58:38.616 --> 00:58:39.976
dominate us.
<v Sheila>They are depicted</v>

1374
00:58:39.976 --> 00:58:41.316
as monsters.

1375
00:58:41.316 --> 00:58:43.276
<v Voiceover>Oh, it's just an awful scenarios,</v>

1376
00:58:43.276 --> 00:58:45.276
that Hollywood's putting this great fear into people

1377
00:58:45.276 --> 00:58:47.016
and as THEO was just saying,

1378
00:58:47.016 --> 00:58:49.966
and this is my experience, I totally concur,

1379
00:58:49.966 --> 00:58:52.216
that we're all aliens here.

1380
00:58:52.216 --> 00:58:54.506
We've all come for this experience.

1381
00:58:54.506 --> 00:58:55.916
There's no one native to this planet,

1382
00:58:55.916 --> 00:58:59.036
except perhaps the original animals and plants.

1383
00:58:59.036 --> 00:59:02.616
So, we might as well start embracing each other,

1384
00:59:02.616 --> 00:59:03.456
not just here,

1385
00:59:03.456 --> 00:59:05.416
but beyond.
<v Sheila>That's true.</v>

1386
00:59:05.416 --> 00:59:07.276
<v Voiceover>And any thoughts of your own?</v>

1387
00:59:07.276 --> 00:59:08.636
We have a couple minutes left on tape

1388
00:59:08.636 --> 00:59:10.296
of this whole 2012 phenomena,

1389
00:59:10.296 --> 00:59:12.096
because you're doing private sessions

1390
00:59:12.096 --> 00:59:13.296
for people all the time.

1391
00:59:13.296 --> 00:59:16.536
And hearing the fears bubble up on your radio show.

1392
00:59:16.536 --> 00:59:18.696
What is it you want to say, to just like,

1393
00:59:18.696 --> 00:59:20.476
cut the fear?

1394
00:59:20.476 --> 00:59:22.625
<v ->You know, it's just embrace the possibility.</v>

1395
00:59:22.625 --> 00:59:25.726
If you could just, stay in the moment,

1396
00:59:25.726 --> 00:59:28.546
because THEO's been teaching me

1397
00:59:28.546 --> 00:59:29.996
for over 40 years.

1398
00:59:29.996 --> 00:59:31.735
And all of us.

1399
00:59:31.735 --> 00:59:34.925
And I have used their teachings

1400
00:59:34.925 --> 00:59:37.295
to do the work myself.

1401
00:59:37.295 --> 00:59:39.036
And I know it works.

1402
00:59:39.036 --> 00:59:42.905
I know if you go in and do the integrative processes,

1403
00:59:42.905 --> 00:59:46.735
then you do become better at manifestation.

1404
00:59:46.735 --> 00:59:49.876
You become better, healthier,

1405
00:59:49.876 --> 00:59:52.855
you become better with your family members

1406
00:59:52.855 --> 00:59:54.786
and your friendships.

1407
00:59:54.786 --> 00:59:58.226
Just everything blossoms.

1408
00:59:58.226 --> 01:00:00.336
And it's been my personal experience

1409
01:00:00.336 --> 01:00:02.426
working with the information,

1410
01:00:02.426 --> 01:00:03.895
and doing it.

1411
01:00:03.895 --> 01:00:06.576
It's just wrapping your arms around it.

1412
01:00:06.576 --> 01:00:09.856
And because most of us think,

1413
01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:10.938
if we go inside,

1414
01:00:10.938 --> 01:00:13.275
and we open that Pandora's Box,

1415
01:00:14.898 --> 01:00:16.588
we're gonna find out

1416
01:00:16.588 --> 01:00:18.638
we're as bad as we think we are.

1417
01:00:18.638 --> 01:00:20.678
And it's the complete opposite.

1418
01:00:20.678 --> 01:00:22.218
As THEO says,

1419
01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:25.128
you find the divine being that, that is you.

1420
01:00:25.128 --> 01:00:26.358
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>
<v ->And that's a blessing.</v>

1421
01:00:26.358 --> 01:00:28.368
<v Voiceover>And in closing, I want to say,</v>

1422
01:00:28.368 --> 01:00:30.408
I've come to know you well now.

1423
01:00:30.408 --> 01:00:32.888
It's been our pleasure to become

1424
01:00:32.888 --> 01:00:34.598
friends with you and Marcus.

1425
01:00:34.598 --> 01:00:37.098
And there's just this beautiful resonance,

1426
01:00:37.098 --> 01:00:39.658
but I have witnessed what you're saying in your life.

1427
01:00:39.658 --> 01:00:41.038
I've seen they way,

1428
01:00:41.038 --> 01:00:42.818
what you have manifested for yourself,

1429
01:00:42.818 --> 01:00:46.778
in your life, by way of grace, and peace, and beauty.

1430
01:00:46.778 --> 01:00:49.278
By living these principles THEO has given you

1431
01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:50.718
through the years, and I have to say,

1432
01:00:50.718 --> 01:00:53.218
from what I witnessed, it absolutely works.

1433
01:00:53.218 --> 01:00:55.068
And I want to thank you so much

1434
01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:58.018
for being so gracious, as to give us your time once again.

<v ->Oh thanks, Regina, it's been my pleasure.</v>

1436
01:00:59.898 --> 01:01:02.316
And I love the friendship, as well.

<v ->To have more insights on what THEO</v>

1438
01:01:06.238 --> 01:01:08.018
has to say about our times from

1439
01:01:08.018 --> 01:01:11.018
relationships to ascended consciousness and more,
