00:00:00.995 --> 00:00:03.996
<v ->It's been said that attachment to the material world</v>

2
00:00:03.996 --> 00:00:06.404
is at the root of most of our suffering.

3
00:00:06.404 --> 00:00:09.262
Eco-phiolospher extraordinaire Peter Russell

4
00:00:09.262 --> 00:00:11.103
tells us why in this conversation

5
00:00:11.103 --> 00:00:13.045
about the art of letting go.

6
00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:14.713
Peter says part of the problem is that

7
00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:17.608
the media is constantly telling us what we're lacking,

8
00:00:17.608 --> 00:00:20.978
which creates a sense of need that is false is nature.

9
00:00:20.978 --> 00:00:24.310
From there he tells us how to unplug from what's not real,

10
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.489
and anchor into what is.

11
00:00:31.818 --> 00:00:33.355 line:15% 
<v Interviewer>As a species,</v>

12
00:00:33.355 --> 00:00:37.290 line:15% 
we seem to have an issue with letting go.

13
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.305
Letting go of things, letting go of each other,

14
00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:43.134
letting go of emotions, we have many attachments.

15
00:00:43.134 --> 00:00:44.870
And this is something

16
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.008
you've given a great amount of thought to.

17
00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:51.836
So, why is it that we're so afraid of letting go,

18
00:00:51.836 --> 00:00:54.447
as a jumping off place here.

19
00:00:54.447 --> 00:00:55.541
<v ->Why are we so afraid?</v>

20
00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:57.944
I think we think we're going to lose something.

21
00:00:57.944 --> 00:01:00.147
Rather than gain something.

22
00:01:00.147 --> 00:01:03.387
And I think the other side of the question is,

23
00:01:03.387 --> 00:01:05.493
why do we hold on?

24
00:01:05.493 --> 00:01:06.586
Why do we hold on?

25
00:01:06.586 --> 00:01:08.725
And we hold on to things because we think,

26
00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:11.234
if there's something we're clinging to,

27
00:01:11.234 --> 00:01:12.357
that I must have this,

28
00:01:12.357 --> 00:01:13.639
and that's one thing we hold on to,

29
00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.405
we get attached to things we want.

30
00:01:15.405 --> 00:01:17.541
We think that's gonna make us happy,

31
00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:19.869
so if we let go of that wanting,

32
00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.604
we think we might not achieve what we're gonna get.

33
00:01:23.604 --> 00:01:24.982
<v Interviewer>Very true,</v>

34
00:01:24.982 --> 00:01:28.182
it seems like we don't have a compass for getting,

35
00:01:28.182 --> 00:01:29.855
except by wanting.

36
00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:32.122
So what's intrinsically wrong with that picture?

37
00:01:32.122 --> 00:01:33.885
<v ->Well, two things.</v>

38
00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.026
First of all,

39
00:01:35.026 --> 00:01:37.793
the letting go actually gets us what we want.

40
00:01:37.793 --> 00:01:39.387
Because ultimately what we want

41
00:01:39.387 --> 00:01:42.729
is to feel okay, to be at peace,

42
00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.791
and what the holding on does, always, the clinging,

43
00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:49.527
it creates a tension in the mind, of some kind or another.

44
00:01:49.527 --> 00:01:52.404
And when you let go, there's a relaxation,

45
00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:53.731
there's a release.

46
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:56.243
And so we actually get what we want,

47
00:01:56.243 --> 00:01:58.609
which is to feel more at ease.

48
00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:00.219
The reason we hold on is,

49
00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.140
we've got this belief system

50
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.682
which I think is indoctrinated into us

51
00:02:03.682 --> 00:02:05.120
from the moment we're born,

52
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.720
that says if we get things just right,

53
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.360
if I can control the world, if I can control other people,

54
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.796
if I can get these things, whatever it is,

55
00:02:11.796 --> 00:02:13.796
I'm going to be okay, I'm going to be happy.

56
00:02:13.796 --> 00:02:16.292
So it's that belief that keeps us holding on,

57
00:02:16.292 --> 00:02:18.056
that keeps us clinging to things.

58
00:02:18.056 --> 00:02:20.169
<v Interviewer>And clinging to each other.</v>

59
00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.174
<v ->Yes, very much.</v>

60
00:02:22.174 --> 00:02:23.572
We cling to each other,

61
00:02:23.572 --> 00:02:26.205
we think this person is going to make me feel better,

62
00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:28.635
give me what I want in some way or another.

63
00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:30.607
And so we hold on to people,

64
00:02:30.607 --> 00:02:32.544
rather than necessarily holding on to relationships,

65
00:02:32.544 --> 00:02:34.650
we hold on to how we think they should be,

66
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.836
what they should do,

67
00:02:35.836 --> 00:02:38.289
and so we end up trying to manipulate them.

68
00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:39.190
<v Interviewer>As you say,</v>

69
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.683
that's where control comes in doesn't it?

70
00:02:40.683 --> 00:02:43.218
<v ->Yes, in a way our whole consciousness</v>

71
00:02:43.218 --> 00:02:47.180
is a control consciousness.

72
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.197
The condition consciousness

73
00:02:48.197 --> 00:02:50.500
that we adopted in the western world

74
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.168
is a control conscious.

75
00:02:52.168 --> 00:02:53.995
It's about if I can remain

76
00:02:53.995 --> 00:02:56.734
in control of my world, and what's happening,

77
00:02:56.734 --> 00:02:58.165
then I'm going to be okay.

78
00:02:58.165 --> 00:03:00.640
I will guarentee myself happiness.

79
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.010
If I'm not in control,

80
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.813
I'm gonna suffer, I'll feel pain.

81
00:03:04.813 --> 00:03:06.409
And so we end up, the whole time,

82
00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.990
in this controlling, manipulative mode of consciousness.

83
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.390
And as I say, all it does,

84
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.281
it makes us more tense, more stressed.

85
00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:17.023
And even if we do get something,

86
00:03:17.023 --> 00:03:18.796
we feel okay for a little bit,

87
00:03:18.796 --> 00:03:21.564
and then it comes back in again, it comes back in again.

88
00:03:21.564 --> 00:03:24.034
<v Interviewer>Isn't that the hallmark of materialism?</v>

89
00:03:24.034 --> 00:03:25.890
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

90
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.467
That's why we're materialist,

91
00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:29.686
because we're continually looking, thinking

92
00:03:29.686 --> 00:03:32.742
if I just had enough of the right things, I'll be okay.

93
00:03:32.742 --> 00:03:34.736
And so we become human havings,

94
00:03:34.736 --> 00:03:36.680
and human doings, rather than human beings.

95
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.017
We're so busy looking to get the right thing.

96
00:03:39.017 --> 00:03:40.311
<v Interviewer>Very well put.</v>

97
00:03:40.311 --> 00:03:44.713
So in this materialistic world we're still a part of.

98
00:03:44.713 --> 00:03:47.059
Having to make a paycheck.

99
00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:51.148
Having to take care of the essentials in life.

100
00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:53.842
How should it go,

101
00:03:53.842 --> 00:03:58.429
in terms of finding that balance between doing and being?

102
00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.270
<v ->I think, well there's many things here.</v>

103
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.136
One, we can create a balance in our daily life.

104
00:04:05.136 --> 00:04:07.305
Because actually recognizing that what happens is,

105
00:04:07.305 --> 00:04:10.337
we need to get sucked into doing doing doing the whole time.

106
00:04:10.337 --> 00:04:13.383
Is to actually gives ourselves a bit of time to be.

107
00:04:13.383 --> 00:04:15.884
And that doesn't even need to be fifteen minutes.

108
00:04:15.884 --> 00:04:17.180
It can be five minutes,

109
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.087
five seconds, to just stop.

110
00:04:20.087 --> 00:04:21.224
And being for me,

111
00:04:21.224 --> 00:04:24.197
is comng back to being with the experience of the moment.

112
00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:27.319
And always the experience of the moment is in the body.

113
00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:28.795
And we come back to the body.

114
00:04:28.795 --> 00:04:29.816
And just feel it.

115
00:04:29.816 --> 00:04:30.930
Feel what the breath is doing.

116
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.335
What do our hands feel like?

117
00:04:32.335 --> 00:04:33.664
What's happening in our chest?

118
00:04:33.664 --> 00:04:35.039
What are we feeling?

119
00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.895
So if we open up to the experience of the feeling,

120
00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:39.242
we're back in the present moment.

121
00:04:39.242 --> 00:04:41.940
And I think if you just did that for 10 seconds,

122
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.145
10 times a day, it would be a healthy start.

123
00:04:45.145 --> 00:04:48.016
Get into that habit of coming back to what is.

124
00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:50.081
Goers just go on and on and on,

125
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:52.915
in this loop the whole time.

126
00:04:52.915 --> 00:04:54.459
<v Interviewer>Eckhart Tolle's work about</v>

127
00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:56.152
The Power of Now, being in the now,

128
00:04:56.152 --> 00:04:58.020
this is a theme that's coming up.

129
00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.527
It doesn't really seem to matter

130
00:04:59.527 --> 00:05:01.667
who you read or who you listen to,

131
00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:04.432
the notion of being present seems to be

132
00:05:04.432 --> 00:05:05.762
where most of the answers lie.

133
00:05:05.762 --> 00:05:08.567
Which is what all the great prophets and masters have said.

134
00:05:08.567 --> 00:05:09.987
<v ->Exactly.</v>

135
00:05:09.987 --> 00:05:12.388
And as Eckhart says, and many of other people have said,

136
00:05:12.388 --> 00:05:14.910
it's our thinking that takes us out of the present.

137
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.271
If you look at your thoughts,

138
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:17.678
your thoughts are always about

139
00:05:17.678 --> 00:05:18.792
something that has happened,

140
00:05:18.792 --> 00:05:19.880
something that went on in the past.

141
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.385
It could even be something that happened two seconds ago,

142
00:05:22.385 --> 00:05:25.086
or two years ago, or something in the future.

143
00:05:25.086 --> 00:05:27.224
What might happen, what might not happen.

144
00:05:27.224 --> 00:05:28.647
How somebody is gonna be,

145
00:05:28.647 --> 00:05:31.520
what are you gonna think of me, must plan to do this.

146
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.023
We're never in the present moment when we're thinking.

147
00:05:35.023 --> 00:05:38.394
In some ways, our thoughts are all in the present moment.

148
00:05:38.394 --> 00:05:40.598
Because the thought itself is right now.

149
00:05:40.598 --> 00:05:43.006
If I'm thinking about the past,

150
00:05:43.006 --> 00:05:45.003
my memory is in the present.

151
00:05:45.003 --> 00:05:47.035
So in some tenses, we're always in the present moment,

152
00:05:47.035 --> 00:05:48.773
but their attention isn't.

153
00:05:48.773 --> 00:05:50.503
So we get caught up in that.

154
00:05:50.503 --> 00:05:51.884
And as soon as we do that,

155
00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:53.270
we lose sight of the present.

156
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.778
We then get caught up in the story,

157
00:05:54.778 --> 00:05:56.582
like it's a movie in our mind

158
00:05:56.582 --> 00:05:57.856
that we're telling ourselves about

159
00:05:57.856 --> 00:06:00.052
what we should have done, or that was good,

160
00:06:00.052 --> 00:06:02.459
or praising ourselves for something.

161
00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:04.362
But all of that keeps us away from the present,

162
00:06:04.362 --> 00:06:06.162
when you're in the present,

163
00:06:06.162 --> 00:06:11.162
that chatter, that internal chatter of the mind isn't there.

164
00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:13.433
<v Interviewer>What about the process</v>

165
00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:15.232
of creating in the present.

166
00:06:15.232 --> 00:06:16.337
I think part of the reason people

167
00:06:16.337 --> 00:06:17.836
have their minds going overtime

168
00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:20.542
is they're attempting to create in that way.

169
00:06:20.542 --> 00:06:23.211
To create prosperity, to create whatever it is,

170
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:24.742
an affect of some kind.

171
00:06:24.742 --> 00:06:26.744
<v ->Right, which is future thinking again.</v>

172
00:06:26.744 --> 00:06:29.619
That's doing something in order

173
00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:31.086
that the future may be better.

174
00:06:31.086 --> 00:06:32.687
Now there's a very important point

175
00:06:32.687 --> 00:06:35.992
of being in the present doesn't mean

176
00:06:35.992 --> 00:06:39.930
not considering the future, and one's own future welfare,

177
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.729
and the welfare of others.

178
00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:46.325
It means accepting your experience in that moment as it is.

179
00:06:46.325 --> 00:06:49.538
People often think being in the present is

180
00:06:49.538 --> 00:06:51.501
"Oh there's injustices in the world,

181
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:53.510
"but it doesn't matter, I'm just accepting them."

182
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.912
It doesn't mean that at all.

183
00:06:54.912 --> 00:06:56.833
It may be, there's many things we need to do,

184
00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:59.084
maybe in terms of injustice or changing things,

185
00:06:59.084 --> 00:07:02.084
maybe in terms of own career, of things we need to do.

186
00:07:02.084 --> 00:07:04.413
But in this moment,

187
00:07:04.413 --> 00:07:07.257
our experience is what it is,

188
00:07:07.257 --> 00:07:08.552
what we get caught up in is,

189
00:07:08.552 --> 00:07:10.384
"Oh I don't want my experience to be like this"

190
00:07:10.384 --> 00:07:13.428
If I'm experiencing suffering because of injustice,

191
00:07:13.428 --> 00:07:15.490
we get into "Oh I must do something about this",

192
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.099
rather than "Hey, what's happening right now

193
00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:21.302
"is an experience of pain, suffering."

194
00:07:21.302 --> 00:07:25.039
Be with that, the present doesn't have to be wonderful.

195
00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:27.973
But when you do that, there's an ease to it

196
00:07:27.973 --> 00:07:28.939
What we tend to do,

197
00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:32.016
is when we have an experience we don't like we resist it.

198
00:07:32.016 --> 00:07:34.413
We fight it.

199
00:07:34.413 --> 00:07:36.882
Rather than just saying, "Okay, this is it."

200
00:07:36.882 --> 00:07:38.284
And often when you do,

201
00:07:38.284 --> 00:07:40.051
you find the experience you're resisting

202
00:07:40.051 --> 00:07:42.315
is actually not as bad as you thought.

203
00:07:42.315 --> 00:07:43.986
A good example with pain.

204
00:07:43.986 --> 00:07:46.896
If we have a pain in the knee, or the shoulder or something,

205
00:07:46.896 --> 00:07:48.128
what we tend to do is,

206
00:07:48.128 --> 00:07:52.190
pain is uncomfortable, we resist it, we block it,

207
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.228
we don't want to experience it.

208
00:07:54.228 --> 00:07:55.271
If you do the opposite,

209
00:07:55.271 --> 00:07:56.565
if you say "Okay, what is this?"

210
00:07:56.565 --> 00:07:59.042
Let me be curious, let me be interested.

211
00:07:59.042 --> 00:08:00.472
What is this pain?

212
00:08:00.472 --> 00:08:01.502
And you can say,

213
00:08:01.502 --> 00:08:03.940
"Oh it's got a sharp bit here, a dull bit there."

214
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.744
And then you find things start moving around a bit,

215
00:08:06.744 --> 00:08:09.051
it starts getting interesting,

216
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:10.048
and then before you know it

217
00:08:10.048 --> 00:08:12.289
your mind is off somewhere else and the pain is gone.

218
00:08:12.289 --> 00:08:13.754
<v Interviewer>So you move through it</v>

219
00:08:13.754 --> 00:08:15.491
much more quickly if you don't resist.

220
00:08:15.491 --> 00:08:16.382
Like most things,

221
00:08:16.382 --> 00:08:17.962
you move through it if you don't resist it.

222
00:08:17.962 --> 00:08:19.755
<v ->And this for me is part of letting go.</v>

223
00:08:19.755 --> 00:08:22.961
For me, the first thing about letting go

224
00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:25.224
is to actually let it in.

225
00:08:25.224 --> 00:08:26.160
We do the opposite.

226
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.708
We think letting go is getting rid of something.

227
00:08:29.708 --> 00:08:32.942
But letting go of feelings or attachments, whatever it is,

228
00:08:32.942 --> 00:08:35.070
you can't let go of something

229
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:36.800
until you've actually let it in.

230
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.744
What we tend to do,

231
00:08:37.744 --> 00:08:39.744
we think letting go is getting rid of,

232
00:08:39.744 --> 00:08:40.766
I think it's the opposite.

233
00:08:40.766 --> 00:08:43.646
Letting go is letting in the experience.

234
00:08:43.646 --> 00:08:46.352
Noticing if it's some suffering or something,

235
00:08:46.352 --> 00:08:48.409
or if there's some attachment.

236
00:08:48.409 --> 00:08:50.054
Noticing it, noticing how you feel,

237
00:08:50.054 --> 00:08:51.583
noticing what the clinging is like.

238
00:08:51.583 --> 00:08:54.790
If it's something you don't like, some aversion,

239
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.959
you're getting annoyed at somebody.

240
00:08:56.959 --> 00:08:59.270
Notice that, let in the feeling,

241
00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:00.834
whatever it is, the annoyance.

242
00:09:00.834 --> 00:09:02.193
<v Interviewer>We must innately know this,</v>

243
00:09:02.193 --> 00:09:05.870
because anybody that, for example has tried clinging

244
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.410
to say a relationship of some kind

245
00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.571
that's not working for them anymore,

246
00:09:10.571 --> 00:09:13.215
knows the pain of that clinging.

247
00:09:13.215 --> 00:09:15.851
<v ->Yeah, so you let in that pain.</v>

248
00:09:15.851 --> 00:09:17.456
You let in the pain of the clinging.

249
00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:19.458
That helps the letting go.

250
00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:21.351
If you really let that in.

251
00:09:21.351 --> 00:09:22.957
And then the second thing that we'll say,

252
00:09:22.957 --> 00:09:24.788
is to let be, let it in.

253
00:09:24.788 --> 00:09:29.003
And then the letting be is accepting it, seeing what it is.

254
00:09:29.003 --> 00:09:32.329
And that frees us up, much more easily.

255
00:09:32.329 --> 00:09:34.470
<v Interviewer>How does this extend into</v>

256
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.510
our view of the world, the planet and ecology.

257
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.129
Because I know this is something that you're very

258
00:09:42.129 --> 00:09:44.710
not only knowledgeable about, but also very concerned about.

259
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.982
We have some real timelines coming up in the future.

260
00:09:47.982 --> 00:09:50.404
We've already set these things in motion.

261
00:09:50.404 --> 00:09:52.154
Let's talk about the art of letting go

262
00:09:52.154 --> 00:09:55.686
as applies to our larger picture.

263
00:09:55.686 --> 00:09:57.658
<v ->The first thing is that doesn't mean</v>

264
00:09:57.658 --> 00:09:59.157
just saying "Well everything is okay.

265
00:09:59.157 --> 00:10:01.689
Let it roll out in this awful way."

266
00:10:01.689 --> 00:10:02.766
It's not that at all.

267
00:10:02.766 --> 00:10:04.562
There's a lot that we need to do.

268
00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:06.191
A lot of things that need changing.

269
00:10:06.191 --> 00:10:07.570
There's a lot of people working on that.

270
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.065
So it's not letting go in terms of giving it up.

271
00:10:11.065 --> 00:10:13.733
It's more in terms of our experience in the moment.

272
00:10:13.733 --> 00:10:15.379
What are we attached to?

273
00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:17.280
Because when we're attached to something,

274
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.750
what attachment does,

275
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.937
it colors our being.

276
00:10:20.937 --> 00:10:22.483
It colors our consciousness.

277
00:10:22.483 --> 00:10:26.022
And we start getting anxious, fearful, whatever.

278
00:10:26.022 --> 00:10:28.079
We start resisting things.

279
00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:30.359
We start getting annoyed

280
00:10:30.359 --> 00:10:33.063
because things aren't the right way.

281
00:10:33.063 --> 00:10:35.156
That can often be an impediment

282
00:10:35.156 --> 00:10:36.529
to us really doing change.

283
00:10:36.529 --> 00:10:39.795
If we get our minds all screwed up and tight,

284
00:10:39.795 --> 00:10:42.201
often then when we act,

285
00:10:42.201 --> 00:10:45.740
we're acting out of anger, or-
<v Interviewer>Desperation?</v>

286
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.862
<v ->Yes</v>

287
00:10:47.862 --> 00:10:49.160
If we can notice those feelings,

288
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.381
let the feelings in, see what they are,

289
00:10:51.381 --> 00:10:53.853
we can actually step back a little bit.

290
00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:55.288
And when we step back,

291
00:10:55.288 --> 00:10:57.510
we can get more in touch with ourselves,

292
00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.975
with who we actually are.

293
00:10:58.975 --> 00:11:01.710
We can get more in touch with our own values,

294
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.259
with what's important to us.

295
00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:05.726
We can get in touch with our own creativity,

296
00:11:05.726 --> 00:11:07.120
our own insights.

297
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.167
And from that, I think, we are able

298
00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:11.726
to come and make change in the world much better.

299
00:11:11.726 --> 00:11:13.460
If we're trying to make change,

300
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.639
and we're just screwed up

301
00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:17.001
and frightened and angry and whatever and tense,

302
00:11:17.001 --> 00:11:19.506
we're not going to make the best decisions.

303
00:11:19.506 --> 00:11:22.444
If we can just step back and be in touch with ourselves.

304
00:11:22.444 --> 00:11:24.206
<v Interviewer>And are we collectively doing this?</v>

305
00:11:24.206 --> 00:11:27.985
As a species, we collectively are holding on to ways of life

306
00:11:27.985 --> 00:11:28.974
that aren't serving us.

307
00:11:28.974 --> 00:11:31.375
<v ->Yes we are.</v>

308
00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:33.817
Holding on to consumption patterns,

309
00:11:33.817 --> 00:11:36.750
whatever it is particularly in terms of our cars,

310
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.192
holding on to using cars,

311
00:11:38.192 --> 00:11:40.862
which may be consuming much more than we need to.

312
00:11:40.862 --> 00:11:42.627
Consuming products we don't need to.

313
00:11:42.627 --> 00:11:46.125
And again, the question that I find useful to ask people,

314
00:11:46.125 --> 00:11:47.803
which helps letting go is,

315
00:11:47.803 --> 00:11:50.703
if there's something you really think,

316
00:11:50.703 --> 00:11:53.003
you have to have this thing, this product,

317
00:11:53.003 --> 00:11:55.410
something you think you've got to buy.

318
00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.173
And yet the inner voice is just saying uh-uh, uh-uh,

319
00:11:58.173 --> 00:11:59.512
there's that little bit. we always know,

320
00:11:59.512 --> 00:12:00.562
there's the inner wisdom that knows.

321
00:12:00.562 --> 00:12:01.483
<v Interviewer>That is true,</v>

322
00:12:01.483 --> 00:12:04.454
you know I don't really need this, yeah.

323
00:12:04.454 --> 00:12:06.754
<v ->There's two questions.</v>

324
00:12:06.754 --> 00:12:08.861
First question is,

325
00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:12.225
if I got this, whatever it is, this new jacket,

326
00:12:12.225 --> 00:12:16.657
this whatever we think we're gonna need, a bigger car,

327
00:12:16.657 --> 00:12:20.299
would I really be happy?

328
00:12:20.299 --> 00:12:21.459
And if you look at that question,

329
00:12:21.459 --> 00:12:23.938
the answer usually is no,

330
00:12:23.938 --> 00:12:25.409
maybe for a little bit,

331
00:12:25.409 --> 00:12:26.941
but in the end it wouldn't really

332
00:12:26.941 --> 00:12:30.114
make my life significantly better.

333
00:12:30.114 --> 00:12:32.313
And then the opposite question is

334
00:12:32.313 --> 00:12:35.583
if I don't have it, can I still be happy?

335
00:12:35.583 --> 00:12:38.581
And the answer to that is nearly always yes.

336
00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:40.956
And that helps free us up.

337
00:12:40.956 --> 00:12:42.752
And one of the things-

338
00:12:42.752 --> 00:12:45.157
<v Interviewer>It's a good exercise, simple and direct.</v>

339
00:12:45.157 --> 00:12:46.157
Good exercise.

340
00:12:46.157 --> 00:12:47.366
<v ->Just those two things,</v>

341
00:12:47.366 --> 00:12:49.002
if I have this will it make me happy,

342
00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:51.158
and if you look at it you realize, not much.

343
00:12:51.158 --> 00:12:53.267
And if I don't have it, can I still be happy?

344
00:12:53.267 --> 00:12:55.832
And that's the crucial one,

345
00:12:55.832 --> 00:12:58.803
because what happens in our culture,

346
00:12:58.803 --> 00:13:02.345
we tell ourselves that we're missing something.

347
00:13:02.345 --> 00:13:05.703
And in our culture, all the marketing, the adverts we see,

348
00:13:05.703 --> 00:13:07.017
they're all saying to us,

349
00:13:07.017 --> 00:13:09.343
"You can't be satisfied with what you have.

350
00:13:09.343 --> 00:13:11.422
"There's something that's missing.

351
00:13:11.422 --> 00:13:13.987
"And if you buy this product, this credit card,

352
00:13:13.987 --> 00:13:15.991
"this insurance policy, whatever it is,

353
00:13:15.991 --> 00:13:17.519
"you are gonna feel better.

354
00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:19.721
"You can't feel perfect as you are."

355
00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:22.625
And so we create a sense of lack.

356
00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:24.890
Or they help create a sense of lack.

357
00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.463
We buy into that.

358
00:13:26.463 --> 00:13:29.202
And then we make ourselves feel uncomfortable.

359
00:13:29.202 --> 00:13:30.905
There's something missing in our life.

360
00:13:30.905 --> 00:13:33.641
We create suffering for ourselves.

361
00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:36.077
So what we do,

362
00:13:36.077 --> 00:13:38.608
we go out and get that thing,

363
00:13:38.608 --> 00:13:41.517
we buy that thing, whatever it is, that service.

364
00:13:41.517 --> 00:13:43.015
<v Interviewer>That someone else has told us we needed.</v>

365
00:13:43.015 --> 00:13:45.015
Or we may not have known we had to have that prior to that.

366
00:13:45.015 --> 00:13:48.393
<v ->And we get it, and for a short while we feel better.</v>

367
00:13:48.393 --> 00:13:51.251
And we think that reason we're feeling better

368
00:13:51.251 --> 00:13:54.234
is because getting that whatever it was, that jacket,

369
00:13:54.234 --> 00:13:56.124
made us feel better.

370
00:13:56.124 --> 00:13:57.567
The truth is,

371
00:13:57.567 --> 00:13:58.890
all that happened was,

372
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:03.534
we were making ourselves feel uncomfortable, discontent.

373
00:14:03.534 --> 00:14:07.779
Now temporarily we stopped making ourselves feel discontent.

374
00:14:07.779 --> 00:14:09.641
But there's a thousand other things coming in,

375
00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:11.960
and 10 minutes later, 10 days later,

376
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.814
we're going to feel discontent again.

377
00:14:13.814 --> 00:14:15.053
But that's what happens.

378
00:14:15.053 --> 00:14:19.123
We create discontent for ourselves over the way things are.

379
00:14:19.123 --> 00:14:22.424
And then try to get rid of that discontent by doing things.

380
00:14:22.424 --> 00:14:25.155
Whereas if we can just see that,

381
00:14:25.155 --> 00:14:26.218
we don't have to do it.

382
00:14:26.218 --> 00:14:30.096
Because the discontent is what is stopping us being happy.

383
00:14:30.096 --> 00:14:31.066
<v Interviewer>You're so right,</v>

384
00:14:31.066 --> 00:14:33.124
and I've even noticed the last several years

385
00:14:33.124 --> 00:14:35.296
as spring time comes,

386
00:14:35.296 --> 00:14:37.232
and yeah girly things,

387
00:14:37.232 --> 00:14:39.638
you want a new skirt or dress or something like that,

388
00:14:39.638 --> 00:14:41.705
I'll go shopping and come back

389
00:14:41.705 --> 00:14:45.281
with maybe a dress and a sweater or whatnot,

390
00:14:45.281 --> 00:14:47.283
but I always feel depleted,

391
00:14:47.283 --> 00:14:50.084
I don't feel good after I've done it.

392
00:14:50.084 --> 00:14:51.982
It's a rare occassion where I'll go and purchase something

393
00:14:51.982 --> 00:14:53.216
and actually feel better.

394
00:14:53.216 --> 00:14:58.029
In fact, something about the experience makes me feel worse.

395
00:14:58.029 --> 00:15:00.685
Like my being has just participated in something

396
00:15:00.685 --> 00:15:02.358
that's not really healthy.

397
00:15:02.358 --> 00:15:03.265
I don't understand.

398
00:15:03.265 --> 00:15:04.536
It's completely subconscious.

399
00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:06.565
I don't know if I have a belief system

400
00:15:06.565 --> 00:15:08.764
on a conscious level about that.

401
00:15:08.764 --> 00:15:09.936
<v ->Well it could be two things.</v>

402
00:15:09.936 --> 00:15:12.533
One, just a lot of those stores, being in them.

403
00:15:12.533 --> 00:15:14.577
With all the energy in them,

404
00:15:14.577 --> 00:15:17.012
the air-conditioning, there's that side.

405
00:15:17.012 --> 00:15:19.637
I know when I go in stores, I feel tired because of them.

406
00:15:19.637 --> 00:15:21.582
But secondly, and probably more importantly,

407
00:15:21.582 --> 00:15:25.547
you know deep inside that that isn't really the way.

408
00:15:25.547 --> 00:15:27.793
You know you didn't really need that,

409
00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:30.815
or you didn't quite need so many of them, whatever it is.

410
00:15:30.815 --> 00:15:34.365
When we're not being true to our inner self,

411
00:15:34.365 --> 00:15:35.524
we feel a discontent.

412
00:15:35.524 --> 00:15:36.465
We all feel that,

413
00:15:36.465 --> 00:15:39.183
when we're not actually living out our truth.

414
00:15:39.183 --> 00:15:40.770
<v Interviewer>And that comes on many levels,</v>

415
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:44.266
including even just having communication with each other.

416
00:15:44.266 --> 00:15:46.344
Being manipulative in conversation,

417
00:15:46.344 --> 00:15:49.769
again this desire to win, to dominate.

418
00:15:49.769 --> 00:15:52.348
We have these attachments even in this way.

419
00:15:52.348 --> 00:15:54.938
<v ->And that's where, when we let go,</v>

420
00:15:54.938 --> 00:15:56.219
and what happens when you let go,

421
00:15:56.219 --> 00:15:58.756
you come back into the present.

422
00:15:58.756 --> 00:16:02.646
And that need to judge, to dominate,

423
00:16:02.646 --> 00:16:05.994
to weigh people up, to control them,

424
00:16:05.994 --> 00:16:08.752
isn't there anymore, or not nearly so much.

425
00:16:08.752 --> 00:16:10.797
Because back in the present,

426
00:16:10.797 --> 00:16:12.235
you are what you're looking for,

427
00:16:12.235 --> 00:16:14.188
there's that inner fulfillment,

428
00:16:14.188 --> 00:16:17.861
and it's not this huge great big bliss thing that happens

429
00:16:17.861 --> 00:16:19.305
and you're totally taken over.

430
00:16:19.305 --> 00:16:23.203
It's just a very very quiet, gentle fulfillment, which says

431
00:16:23.203 --> 00:16:27.112
"Things are okay, things are okay."

432
00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:28.676
In this moment, as I say,

433
00:16:28.676 --> 00:16:30.452
it doesn't mean to say you don't need to change things,

434
00:16:30.452 --> 00:16:31.843
and do things and live your life.

435
00:16:31.843 --> 00:16:33.680
But right at this moment, things are okay.

436
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.285
I don't need to put this person in a category,

437
00:16:36.285 --> 00:16:38.720
or whatever it is, judge them,

438
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.893
or say even I should be doing this.

439
00:16:40.893 --> 00:16:42.094
Right now it's okay.

440
00:16:42.094 --> 00:16:45.000
And when we've got that okayness with us,

441
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.190
we don't have to go out and look for it.

442
00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.235
And that's what we're doing.

443
00:16:48.235 --> 00:16:50.503
We're looking for the things to make us okay,

444
00:16:50.503 --> 00:16:53.531
rather than recognizing deep inside us

445
00:16:53.531 --> 00:16:54.801
is what we're looking for.

446
00:16:54.801 --> 00:16:56.499
But it's covered up the whole time,

447
00:16:56.499 --> 00:16:59.251
by all the thoughts, things we're telling ourselves,

448
00:16:59.251 --> 00:17:01.785
the judgements, the grievances, the hopes.

449
00:17:01.785 --> 00:17:02.880
All this stuff.

450
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.285
We're so busy thinking thinking thinking, worrying.

451
00:17:06.285 --> 00:17:08.671
Feeling this, feeling that.

452
00:17:08.671 --> 00:17:10.498
<v Interviewer>Trying.</v>
<v Peter>Trying.</v>

453
00:17:10.498 --> 00:17:12.891
<v Peter>Trying is a very important one.</v>

454
00:17:12.891 --> 00:17:15.625
We don't actually give ourselves the opportunity to notice

455
00:17:15.625 --> 00:17:17.829
what is there all along.

456
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.763
<v Interviewer>And if we go to the place of knowing</v>

457
00:17:19.763 --> 00:17:23.107
that everything is just fine in that moment as it is,

458
00:17:23.107 --> 00:17:25.736
that's where we gain our clarity

459
00:17:25.736 --> 00:17:28.778
to be able to start making truly intelligent decisions

460
00:17:28.778 --> 00:17:30.942
about our lives, each other, our planet.

461
00:17:30.942 --> 00:17:34.138
<v ->Because then we're free.</v>

462
00:17:34.138 --> 00:17:35.245
When we're not in that,

463
00:17:35.245 --> 00:17:37.600
when we're caught up in our thinking, we're not free.

464
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.622
We're controlled by the stories we're telling ourselves,

465
00:17:40.622 --> 00:17:42.747
by the automatic thinking patterns.

466
00:17:42.747 --> 00:17:44.589
And we are very much on automatic.

467
00:17:44.589 --> 00:17:46.386
We often don't realize it's happening.

468
00:17:46.386 --> 00:17:48.190
And the strange thing is,

469
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.013
most of our thoughts are about ourselves

470
00:17:50.013 --> 00:17:51.800
in one way or another.

471
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.003
And the irony is,

472
00:17:53.003 --> 00:17:54.661
all the time we're caught up in thinking,

473
00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:56.896
we're not actually aware of ourselves.

474
00:17:56.896 --> 00:17:58.631
<v Interviewer>Like that Mark Twain quote.</v>

475
00:17:58.631 --> 00:18:01.143
"I've had many tragedies in my life,

476
00:18:01.143 --> 00:18:02.769
most of which never occured."

477
00:18:02.769 --> 00:18:05.049
<v ->RIght, but while we're so busy worrying about them</v>

478
00:18:05.049 --> 00:18:07.883
you're not here, you're not in touch with yourself.

479
00:18:07.883 --> 00:18:12.456
<v Interviewer>So let's extend this out now as a culture.</v>

480
00:18:12.456 --> 00:18:15.054
It's being reinforced all the time,

481
00:18:15.054 --> 00:18:17.457
that well we know things are about to change,

482
00:18:17.457 --> 00:18:20.223
we've watched the prices of gasoline double, even triple

483
00:18:20.223 --> 00:18:24.202
in some cases in just the last couple or three years.

484
00:18:24.202 --> 00:18:27.232
So now this is threatening a way of life

485
00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:30.906
to which we feel entitled.

486
00:18:30.906 --> 00:18:33.106
Now what?

487
00:18:33.106 --> 00:18:36.875
<v ->We're gonna have to let go of some of that.</v>

488
00:18:36.875 --> 00:18:39.111
Which means, when we hold on to,

489
00:18:39.111 --> 00:18:43.029
we think, you say, we're entitled to it.

490
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:45.820
Things are gonna have to change.

491
00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.992
And we don't know quite how it's going to look.

492
00:18:47.992 --> 00:18:49.509
But, what seems pretty certain

493
00:18:49.509 --> 00:18:51.448
is the price of oil is going to keep increasing,

494
00:18:51.448 --> 00:18:53.928
that's gonna run all the way through society.

495
00:18:53.928 --> 00:18:55.827
Oil is factored into virtually everything.

496
00:18:55.827 --> 00:18:57.295
If it's not made from oil,

497
00:18:57.295 --> 00:19:00.628
transport is in the price,

498
00:19:00.628 --> 00:19:01.598
so we're gonna find-

499
00:19:01.598 --> 00:19:03.706
<v Interviewer>And we have reached that peak oil point,</v>

500
00:19:03.706 --> 00:19:05.141
according to many.

501
00:19:05.141 --> 00:19:06.506
<v ->We have I think yes,</v>

502
00:19:06.506 --> 00:19:08.141
I mean the forecast is

503
00:19:08.141 --> 00:19:11.780
that when the production reaches its peak,

504
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.815
and the demand is still going up,

505
00:19:13.815 --> 00:19:15.018
then the only thing that can happen,

506
00:19:15.018 --> 00:19:19.125
which is very very basic economics 101, class one,

507
00:19:19.125 --> 00:19:23.609
supply and demand, the price goes up.

508
00:19:23.609 --> 00:19:25.358
We can't increase production much more,

509
00:19:25.358 --> 00:19:26.754
the demand is gonna keep going,

510
00:19:26.754 --> 00:19:30.129
so the price is gonna keep going up and up and up.

511
00:19:30.129 --> 00:19:32.128
And that means things generally,

512
00:19:32.128 --> 00:19:34.499
cost of living is gonna get much more expensive.

513
00:19:34.499 --> 00:19:36.640
Which means things are gonna be harder,

514
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.594
we aren't gonna have all the things we're used to.

515
00:19:41.794 --> 00:19:43.413
We can look at that and say,

516
00:19:43.413 --> 00:19:45.173
"Oh my God, I'm gonna suffer",

517
00:19:45.173 --> 00:19:48.017
and we can create a lot of pain for ourselves over that.

518
00:19:48.017 --> 00:19:50.753
Or we can begin to look and say this basic question

519
00:19:50.753 --> 00:19:53.151
"If I don't have some of these things I'm used to,

520
00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:55.302
or think I'm entitled to,

521
00:19:55.302 --> 00:19:57.856
can I still be at peace?"

522
00:19:57.856 --> 00:20:00.592
And I think the answer is yes.

523
00:20:00.592 --> 00:20:01.858
It's interesting,

524
00:20:01.858 --> 00:20:06.858
some of the most happy, fulfilled people I know

525
00:20:06.935 --> 00:20:11.369
are people who live very close to the edge financially.

526
00:20:11.369 --> 00:20:15.454
And a lot of the people I know who have great wealth,

527
00:20:15.454 --> 00:20:17.753
they are not nearly as peaceful.

528
00:20:17.753 --> 00:20:18.942
<v Interviewer>Great fear of losing that-</v>

529
00:20:18.942 --> 00:20:21.581
<v ->Great fear of losing the wealth, they're holding on.</v>

530
00:20:21.581 --> 00:20:24.221
They're holding on to their wealth.

531
00:20:24.221 --> 00:20:25.409
Are they going to get burgled

532
00:20:25.409 --> 00:20:26.941
and lose their famous paintings?

533
00:20:26.941 --> 00:20:29.127
What's going to happen to the stock market?

534
00:20:29.127 --> 00:20:31.189
My friend who just pumps gas,

535
00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:33.924
she doesn't care what happens to the stock market.

536
00:20:33.924 --> 00:20:35.724
She hasn't gotten any important pictures to be stolen,

537
00:20:35.724 --> 00:20:39.455
she hasn't a great insurance policy to keep up.

538
00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:42.027
Her brand new Mercedes isn't gonna get scratched,

539
00:20:42.027 --> 00:20:43.432
she hasn't got one.

540
00:20:43.432 --> 00:20:46.469
There's an ease in that simplicity.

541
00:20:46.469 --> 00:20:49.667
We believe that, "Oh if I was rich,

542
00:20:49.667 --> 00:20:53.051
"if I was a millionaire I'd be happy."

543
00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:55.084
A few are, a few are,

544
00:20:55.084 --> 00:20:57.418
but it's nothing to do with the fact they're rich.

545
00:20:57.418 --> 00:20:59.650
They're just the people who know

546
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.084
how to be at ease with what they have.

547
00:21:01.084 --> 00:21:02.754
<v Interviewer>And as you say, this world we're in,</v>

548
00:21:02.754 --> 00:21:05.319
this isn't supposition,

549
00:21:05.319 --> 00:21:08.258
these aren't wild predictions anymore,

550
00:21:08.258 --> 00:21:11.400
this is a reality that we're being faced with now.

551
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.633
And there's an interesting documentary out

552
00:21:13.633 --> 00:21:15.039
called The End of Suburbia,

553
00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:16.634
it's been out for a couple of years, have you seen that?

554
00:21:16.634 --> 00:21:17.630
<v ->No I haven't.</v>

555
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.334
<v Interviewer>What they're talkin about is,</v>

556
00:21:19.334 --> 00:21:22.177
what happens to our culture when peak oil occurs?

557
00:21:22.177 --> 00:21:25.976
Which, they only debate within a short window of time,

558
00:21:25.976 --> 00:21:27.510
most agree we're already there,

559
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:30.912
basically the end of the 3000 mile caeser salad,

560
00:21:30.912 --> 00:21:32.649
as they say, is finished.

561
00:21:32.649 --> 00:21:37.648
And so, let's look at how we might invite that reality in,

562
00:21:37.648 --> 00:21:40.882
because it's coming upon us pretty quickly now.

563
00:21:40.882 --> 00:21:43.630
And look at how we can make the best of that,

564
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:47.037
and actually turn that into a benefit, a positive.

565
00:21:47.037 --> 00:21:48.725
How can our lives change for the better

566
00:21:48.725 --> 00:21:51.130
with peak oil and all of its ramifications?

567
00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:54.443
<v ->I think it's an invitation for us</v>

568
00:21:54.443 --> 00:21:58.070
to look within and to explore ourselves

569
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:59.835
and wake up more.

570
00:21:59.835 --> 00:22:02.850
I think the two things that's demanding of us,

571
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:06.416
is one, flexibility.

572
00:22:06.416 --> 00:22:08.224
Things are gonna change.

573
00:22:08.224 --> 00:22:12.083
And we need to better move with the changes.

574
00:22:12.083 --> 00:22:14.788
What we tend to do is hold on to the past.

575
00:22:14.788 --> 00:22:16.491
This is how things have been in the past,

576
00:22:16.491 --> 00:22:17.733
we hold on to our image

577
00:22:17.733 --> 00:22:19.365
of how they're gonna be in the future.

578
00:22:19.365 --> 00:22:20.401
We need to be able to say

579
00:22:20.401 --> 00:22:22.806
"Maybe it's not gonna be like that.

580
00:22:22.806 --> 00:22:25.509
"Maybe I got to look at things in a different way."

581
00:22:25.509 --> 00:22:27.977
So we're gonna learn to become flexible.

582
00:22:27.977 --> 00:22:30.975
And that is about not holding on.

583
00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:34.615
So, developing flexibility.

584
00:22:34.615 --> 00:22:36.415
And the second thing I think we need to develop

585
00:22:36.415 --> 00:22:38.754
is an inner stability.

586
00:22:38.754 --> 00:22:42.758
Which means we're not thrown around in motion by things.

587
00:22:42.758 --> 00:22:46.317
That if the price for oil goes up more,

588
00:22:46.317 --> 00:22:47.387
and there's certain things

589
00:22:47.387 --> 00:22:51.497
that maybe we can't afford or are not available,

590
00:22:51.497 --> 00:22:52.493
that is the way it is.

591
00:22:52.493 --> 00:22:55.296
Not to then get all emotionally screwed up,

592
00:22:55.296 --> 00:22:58.667
and make ourselves suffer even more, and more tension.

593
00:22:58.667 --> 00:23:00.666
Because I think the key thing is to realize

594
00:23:00.666 --> 00:23:02.634
that nearly all our suffering is self-created.

595
00:23:02.634 --> 00:23:05.180
Not our pain, but our suffering

596
00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.352
is our discontent and what we feel, that's self-created.

597
00:23:08.352 --> 00:23:11.653
So it's a chance to really step back and see that.

598
00:23:11.653 --> 00:23:13.919
And if we can really see that,

599
00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:16.321
then I think we're doing great spiritual work,

600
00:23:16.321 --> 00:23:18.416
if we can really see the extent to which

601
00:23:18.416 --> 00:23:21.765
we create our discontent, our anxiety,

602
00:23:21.765 --> 00:23:23.898
our frustration, our aversions.

603
00:23:23.898 --> 00:23:25.232
We can see that.

604
00:23:25.232 --> 00:23:26.961
<v Interviewer>By placing judgements?</v>

605
00:23:26.961 --> 00:23:27.869
<v ->Yeah.</v>

606
00:23:27.869 --> 00:23:30.041
If we can see that, just stepping back.

607
00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:32.273
That's 50 percent of it, always,

608
00:23:32.273 --> 00:23:34.291
is the recognition of what's going on.

609
00:23:34.291 --> 00:23:36.414
You say "Ah, instead of being trapped

610
00:23:36.414 --> 00:23:38.103
"in this story I'm telling myself about

611
00:23:38.103 --> 00:23:40.950
"I have to have this or it's the end of the world."

612
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.284
It's realizing it's not the end of the world.

613
00:23:43.284 --> 00:23:46.978
And maybe I can actually feel better in it.

614
00:23:46.978 --> 00:23:48.321
<v Interviewer>It seems like that,</v>

615
00:23:48.321 --> 00:23:50.893
as I have for years

616
00:23:50.893 --> 00:23:53.257
looked at what it might be like down the road,

617
00:23:53.257 --> 00:23:54.858
and now we're closer to that.

618
00:23:54.858 --> 00:23:57.057
It seems to me there's a golden opportunity here

619
00:23:57.057 --> 00:24:00.695
to, as you say, find our own humanity,

620
00:24:00.695 --> 00:24:02.773
find our own internal stability,

621
00:24:02.773 --> 00:24:03.723
but not only that,

622
00:24:03.723 --> 00:24:05.773
build a different kind of community,

623
00:24:05.773 --> 00:24:08.845
become involved with growing crops,

624
00:24:08.845 --> 00:24:11.242
growing vegetables in our backyard.

625
00:24:11.242 --> 00:24:14.244
Let grandma and grandpa live with us.

626
00:24:14.244 --> 00:24:15.603
What's wrong with these things?

627
00:24:15.603 --> 00:24:17.178
We've let go of all of these things.

628
00:24:17.178 --> 00:24:18.951
Do you have some ideas about all this?

629
00:24:18.951 --> 00:24:22.257
<v ->I think that's the third element, is community, support.</v>

630
00:24:22.257 --> 00:24:24.024
What gets us through difficult times

631
00:24:24.024 --> 00:24:25.491
is nearly always community.

632
00:24:25.491 --> 00:24:28.319
I was speaking to a friend who lived in Zagreb,

633
00:24:28.319 --> 00:24:31.664
through the war there in the 1990s.

634
00:24:31.664 --> 00:24:35.602
And she was running a chain of health food stores.

635
00:24:35.602 --> 00:24:38.001
The first ones in Yugoslavia, interestingly enough,

636
00:24:38.001 --> 00:24:39.393
organic food stores.

637
00:24:39.393 --> 00:24:42.504
She saw three of her four stores bombed out.

638
00:24:42.504 --> 00:24:45.546
And I said "How did you survive that emotionally?"

639
00:24:45.546 --> 00:24:47.583
And she said "Be able to sit down with friends,

640
00:24:47.583 --> 00:24:49.850
"and have a cup of tea and talk about it."

641
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.816
It was friends that got her through,

642
00:24:51.816 --> 00:24:54.619
it wasn't money or whatever, it was her friends.

643
00:24:54.619 --> 00:24:56.958
Time and time again it's community,

644
00:24:56.958 --> 00:24:58.841
it's friends that's so important.

645
00:24:58.841 --> 00:25:00.724
<v Interviewer>Do you think in a sense we've,</v>

646
00:25:00.724 --> 00:25:02.222
because of our attachments

647
00:25:02.222 --> 00:25:05.628
and because of our tryingness and doingness,

648
00:25:05.628 --> 00:25:07.637
that we've actually lost some of the

649
00:25:07.637 --> 00:25:10.907
true understanding of what constitutes friendship,

650
00:25:10.907 --> 00:25:12.141
genuine friendship?

651
00:25:12.141 --> 00:25:14.107
<v ->I think we have, we've lost community.</v>

652
00:25:14.107 --> 00:25:16.782
I see many people in the US.

653
00:25:16.782 --> 00:25:21.405
They live in, "communities", housing communities.

654
00:25:21.405 --> 00:25:23.751
All they know about their neighbor is the car they drive.

655
00:25:23.751 --> 00:25:24.879
Because they see them

656
00:25:24.879 --> 00:25:27.220
backing out of the drive each morning going off to work.

657
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:28.551
They probably didn't even see them

658
00:25:28.551 --> 00:25:30.149
because they come out the garage.

659
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:31.761
<v Interviewer>Yet you might be living only 15 feet apart.</v>

660
00:25:31.761 --> 00:25:32.756
<v ->Yeah.</v>

661
00:25:32.756 --> 00:25:33.956
Whereas the old communities,

662
00:25:33.956 --> 00:25:36.398
we're everybody knew each other, and support each other.

663
00:25:36.398 --> 00:25:38.221
I grew up in a village in England

664
00:25:38.221 --> 00:25:41.038
where if anybody needed anything...

665
00:25:41.038 --> 00:25:43.438
I now live on a boat in a harbor,

666
00:25:43.438 --> 00:25:45.097
which again is a natural community.

667
00:25:45.097 --> 00:25:46.266
Everybody knows everybody,

668
00:25:46.266 --> 00:25:47.672
you're there to support.

669
00:25:47.672 --> 00:25:49.580
If I leave my car headlights on,

670
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.910
someone comes and bangs on the boat

671
00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:52.883
and says "Hey you left your lights on."

672
00:25:52.883 --> 00:25:55.918
That's community, is people supporting each other.

673
00:25:55.918 --> 00:26:00.269
<v Interviewer>And we're going to be needing this.</v>

674
00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:02.818
We need to start actually addressing this subject now,

675
00:26:02.818 --> 00:26:05.252
rather than waiting 'till it's a little late,

676
00:26:05.252 --> 00:26:09.506
or you're neighbor has lettuce and you don't. (laughs)

677
00:26:10.776 --> 00:26:12.490
<v ->Always it's good to have community.</v>

678
00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.364
Get to know your people, support each other.

679
00:26:15.364 --> 00:26:17.368
Again, we're so busy doing,

680
00:26:17.368 --> 00:26:19.194
we get into this insular way of life.

681
00:26:19.194 --> 00:26:20.271
<v Interviewer>I know you've</v>

682
00:26:20.271 --> 00:26:21.338
given a lot of thought to this,

683
00:26:21.338 --> 00:26:24.363
so I'm going to ask your prescription

684
00:26:24.363 --> 00:26:28.038
for the view of the future that we are entering.

685
00:26:28.038 --> 00:26:30.619
How are you personally approaching it,

686
00:26:30.619 --> 00:26:32.553
and how do you feel the rest of us should approach it.

687
00:26:32.553 --> 00:26:34.411
Kind of boom boom boom.

688
00:26:34.411 --> 00:26:35.994
What do we need to do to get through?

689
00:26:35.994 --> 00:26:38.191
And not only that, but thrive,

690
00:26:38.191 --> 00:26:41.022
and perhaps even recover big parts of ourselves

691
00:26:41.022 --> 00:26:43.054
in the times that lie ahead.

692
00:26:43.054 --> 00:26:44.597
<v ->For me, I think it's what I just said,</v>

693
00:26:44.597 --> 00:26:47.523
about learning, looking within ourselves.

694
00:26:47.523 --> 00:26:50.135
Developing ourselves, that's the key thing.

695
00:26:50.135 --> 00:26:51.568
There's many things to be done out there,

696
00:26:51.568 --> 00:26:55.895
whether it's about developing alternative energy sources,

697
00:26:55.895 --> 00:26:58.645
using less thirsty cars, whatever it is,

698
00:26:58.645 --> 00:27:00.240
looking at our consumption.

699
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.175
But for me, the key thing is coming back to ourselves.

700
00:27:03.175 --> 00:27:04.238
Looking at ourselves,

701
00:27:04.238 --> 00:27:07.239
looking at what do we really want, that's the first thing.

702
00:27:07.239 --> 00:27:08.583
And what we all really want,

703
00:27:08.583 --> 00:27:10.852
is this thing of how do we feel inside.

704
00:27:10.852 --> 00:27:13.454
And then saying "Okay, what am I doing

705
00:27:13.454 --> 00:27:15.528
to support my inner well-being?"

706
00:27:15.528 --> 00:27:16.935
That's the key thing.

707
00:27:16.935 --> 00:27:18.967
If we're feeling better inside,

708
00:27:18.967 --> 00:27:21.904
we're feeling more stable, secure inside,

709
00:27:21.904 --> 00:27:24.338
then the way we live life's gonna be different.

710
00:27:24.338 --> 00:27:26.573
So looking inside, what do I really need

711
00:27:26.573 --> 00:27:28.438
to support my inner well-being?

712
00:27:28.438 --> 00:27:30.809
How can I become more flexible?

713
00:27:30.809 --> 00:27:32.479
How can I become less attached

714
00:27:32.479 --> 00:27:34.016
to how I think things should be?

715
00:27:34.016 --> 00:27:35.712
When you notice attachments,

716
00:27:35.712 --> 00:27:37.751
just step back a bit, see that,

717
00:27:37.751 --> 00:27:41.212
see the attachment, and then see what it's doing to you.

718
00:27:41.212 --> 00:27:44.327
See the tension it's creating.

719
00:27:44.327 --> 00:27:45.493
There's an old Buddhist saying,

720
00:27:45.493 --> 00:27:46.593
"If you pick up a hot coal,

721
00:27:46.593 --> 00:27:47.962
"you drop it because it's hot,

722
00:27:47.962 --> 00:27:50.199
"because you feel the pain."

723
00:27:50.199 --> 00:27:53.399
But if you're numb you don't drop it, it burns you.

724
00:27:53.399 --> 00:27:55.760
If we can see what our clinging

725
00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.776
to a certain way of life or attitude towards other people,

726
00:27:58.776 --> 00:28:00.139
what that's doing to us,

727
00:28:00.139 --> 00:28:02.946
if we can feel the tension it's creating,

728
00:28:02.946 --> 00:28:05.711
the stress, the pain it's creating,

729
00:28:05.711 --> 00:28:08.650
then we want to let go of it.

730
00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:10.042
We have the motivation to let go,

731
00:28:10.042 --> 00:28:14.011
because we see it's actually not giving us what we want.

732
00:28:14.011 --> 00:28:15.685
So, that's one thing.

733
00:28:15.685 --> 00:28:18.057
I think another very important tool

734
00:28:18.057 --> 00:28:19.523
we can always take with us,

735
00:28:19.523 --> 00:28:21.195
whatever situation we're in,

736
00:28:21.195 --> 00:28:25.062
if there's some friction, tension, not quite right,

737
00:28:25.062 --> 00:28:27.603
is a very important question I always hold,

738
00:28:27.603 --> 00:28:31.337
"Is there another way of looking at this?"

739
00:28:31.337 --> 00:28:33.368
Not to say what is another way,

740
00:28:33.368 --> 00:28:36.168
but if I'm stuck it's nearly always because

741
00:28:36.168 --> 00:28:39.806
I'm stuck in a mindset, a belief system, an attitude,

742
00:28:39.806 --> 00:28:42.211
the ego-mind has got hold of me and is saying,

743
00:28:42.211 --> 00:28:44.043
"This is the way to see things."

744
00:28:44.043 --> 00:28:45.649
And that's what's causing the pain.

745
00:28:45.649 --> 00:28:48.887
I believe we all have a much deeper, wisdom-self,

746
00:28:48.887 --> 00:28:51.353
which knows a higher truth,

747
00:28:51.353 --> 00:28:53.963
and by asking that question,

748
00:28:53.963 --> 00:28:55.567
"Is there another way to see things?"

749
00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:57.834
I'm just opening up.

750
00:28:57.834 --> 00:29:00.057
And not looking for answers or content,

751
00:29:00.057 --> 00:29:01.332
but just opening up.

752
00:29:01.332 --> 00:29:03.192
And very often I find,

753
00:29:03.192 --> 00:29:05.302
I'm looking at things in a different way,

754
00:29:05.302 --> 00:29:06.442
I'm seeing things a different way.

755
00:29:06.442 --> 00:29:09.676
And usually it's a way that's more easy,

756
00:29:09.676 --> 00:29:11.535
there's a relief about it.

757
00:29:11.535 --> 00:29:12.629
It's more compassionate-

758
00:29:12.629 --> 00:29:14.311
<v Interviewer>There's a genuine humility about that.</v>

759
00:29:14.311 --> 00:29:17.513
<v ->Yeah, it's more loving towards the people concerned.</v>

760
00:29:17.513 --> 00:29:20.091
And it's also obviously right.

761
00:29:20.091 --> 00:29:21.986
It's like "Oh, of course, why didn't I see that?"

762
00:29:21.986 --> 00:29:23.016
The reason I didn't see it,

763
00:29:23.016 --> 00:29:26.161
I was so caught in this particular way of looking at it.

764
00:29:26.161 --> 00:29:29.765
So that's a question I always carry around,

765
00:29:29.765 --> 00:29:30.761
and it's a key thing.

766
00:29:30.761 --> 00:29:32.494
It's not asking "What is another way?"

767
00:29:32.494 --> 00:29:35.025
Because that's trying to make something happen again.

768
00:29:35.025 --> 00:29:37.574
It's open curiosity.

769
00:29:37.574 --> 00:29:39.169
Is there perhaps?

770
00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:42.168
Maybe the reason I'm feeling stuck, and unhappy,

771
00:29:42.168 --> 00:29:44.041
is because I got caught in a certain

772
00:29:44.041 --> 00:29:45.143
way of looking at things.

773
00:29:45.143 --> 00:29:46.241
<v Interviewer>That's true,</v>

774
00:29:46.241 --> 00:29:48.049
it has a very different vibration to say

775
00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:49.282
"What's another way I can do this?"

776
00:29:49.282 --> 00:29:50.452
versus "Is there?"

777
00:29:50.452 --> 00:29:51.876
<v ->No harm in asking.</v>

778
00:29:51.876 --> 00:29:52.920
No harm in asking.

779
00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:56.392
Maybe, the reason things aren't quite working out,

780
00:29:56.392 --> 00:29:58.155
is I'm stuck in a certain way of seeing.

781
00:29:58.155 --> 00:30:01.029
So, possibly, is there another way of looking at it?

782
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:03.767
It's surprising what pops into the mind.

783
00:30:03.767 --> 00:30:05.222
<v Interviewer>And funny,</v>

784
00:30:05.222 --> 00:30:08.426
the things that we're most attached to,

785
00:30:08.426 --> 00:30:10.705
seems to me are seldom the things that

786
00:30:10.705 --> 00:30:13.796
have that uh-huh time stand still

787
00:30:13.796 --> 00:30:16.175
while we're participating in these things.

788
00:30:16.175 --> 00:30:17.202
Those aren't the things.

789
00:30:17.202 --> 00:30:20.216
Shopping doesn't make time stand still. (laughs)

790
00:30:20.216 --> 00:30:22.872
<v ->Then most few things we've been told to be attached to.</v>

791
00:30:22.872 --> 00:30:24.482
We've been told this is important,

792
00:30:24.482 --> 00:30:27.189
you need to have this in order to get by,

793
00:30:27.189 --> 00:30:28.681
to get feel okay, or whatever.

794
00:30:28.681 --> 00:30:30.178
And we buy into it.

795
00:30:30.178 --> 00:30:33.563
We don't think.

796
00:30:35.273 --> 00:30:37.731
We have a choice every moment,

797
00:30:37.731 --> 00:30:40.323
about whether we buy into that thinking or not.

798
00:30:40.323 --> 00:30:41.670
We don't always recognize the choice,

799
00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:43.106
because we're so caught up in it,

800
00:30:43.106 --> 00:30:46.511
but we can think "Is this thinking really serving me?"

801
00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:49.775
When you find yourself wanting something.

802
00:30:49.775 --> 00:30:52.042
And that's when I often use that question,

803
00:30:52.042 --> 00:30:53.714
"Is there another way of looking at this?"

804
00:30:53.714 --> 00:30:57.013
And I find, "Yes I don't really need this."

805
00:30:57.013 --> 00:30:59.650
I'm just caught, I'm caught.

806
00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.449
I believe if I have this it's gonna make me happy.

807
00:31:01.449 --> 00:31:03.089
It comes back to those same questions again.

808
00:31:03.089 --> 00:31:04.190
<v Interviewer>Again,</v>

809
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:06.228
the things that generally juice us up

810
00:31:06.228 --> 00:31:07.557
are the simple things:

811
00:31:07.557 --> 00:31:09.196
having a conversation with someone,

812
00:31:09.196 --> 00:31:12.330
a cup of tea, dancing, maybe singing,

813
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:15.868
maybe doodling or writing, or just daydreaming.

814
00:31:15.868 --> 00:31:17.940
<v ->Following your heart. Following your heart.</v>

815
00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.298
<v Interviewer>These are the things</v>

816
00:31:19.298 --> 00:31:20.269
that really make time stand still,

817
00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:21.801
these really are the things

818
00:31:21.801 --> 00:31:23.303
that are going to carry us more toward

819
00:31:23.303 --> 00:31:25.804
our sustainable, balanced self, aren't they?

820
00:31:25.804 --> 00:31:28.038
<v ->And we don't know our heart.</v>

821
00:31:28.038 --> 00:31:31.222
Because we're so busy thinking, worrying, doing.

822
00:31:31.222 --> 00:31:33.586
We don't give ourselves enough time to feel our heart.

823
00:31:33.586 --> 00:31:35.152
And the heart is very quiet.

824
00:31:35.152 --> 00:31:36.993
The heart doesn't speak in these loud

825
00:31:36.993 --> 00:31:38.288
"Do this" message, "I think this,"

826
00:31:38.288 --> 00:31:41.084
and "That person is a real, whatever they are."

827
00:31:41.084 --> 00:31:42.628
The heart is just a feeling.

828
00:31:42.628 --> 00:31:43.894
We need to be quiet,

829
00:31:43.894 --> 00:31:45.069
and come back to the present.

830
00:31:45.069 --> 00:31:47.270
We can only feel the heart in the present.

831
00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:48.831
When you come back to the body,

832
00:31:48.831 --> 00:31:50.894
you can then feel the heart,

833
00:31:50.894 --> 00:31:51.936
you can feel what's there.

834
00:31:51.936 --> 00:31:53.434
And whether it's a sense of

835
00:31:53.434 --> 00:31:56.610
something that's withdrawing or attracting,

836
00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:58.674
or a feeling of at ease.

837
00:31:58.674 --> 00:32:00.581
Then the heart can speak to you and tell you.

838
00:32:00.581 --> 00:32:02.684
I used to have a little sign above my desk,

839
00:32:02.684 --> 00:32:05.879
it was actually a picture, it was a picture of a heart,

840
00:32:05.879 --> 00:32:07.789
with lots of musical notes around it.

841
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:08.756
And that, for me,

842
00:32:08.756 --> 00:32:11.137
oh there was a question mark in it, in the heart,

843
00:32:11.137 --> 00:32:13.162
and that, for me, was a reminder.

844
00:32:13.162 --> 00:32:15.833
Does it make my heart sing?

845
00:32:15.833 --> 00:32:18.160
That's a very useful question I would hold up to myself.

846
00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.566
If I was making a decision.

847
00:32:19.566 --> 00:32:20.570
So I'd be on the phone,

848
00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:23.273
and they'd be asking me "Could I do this, could I do that?"

849
00:32:23.273 --> 00:32:24.603
Does that make my heart sing?

850
00:32:24.603 --> 00:32:28.078
If it didn't make my heart sing, don't wanna do it.

851
00:32:28.078 --> 00:32:29.613
<v Interviewer>What a simple, perfect,</v>

852
00:32:29.613 --> 00:32:33.128
little golden rule to live by.

853
00:32:34.318 --> 00:32:35.313
Thank you.

854
00:32:35.313 --> 00:32:38.281
<v ->My pleasure, thank you.</v>

855
00:32:39.621 --> 00:32:41.152
<v ->If you haven't already seen</v>

856
00:32:41.152 --> 00:32:42.714
our first conversation with Peter,

857
00:32:42.714 --> 00:32:43.958
you might want to do so.

858
00:32:43.958 --> 00:32:46.255
Meanwhile, our interview with Russell Targ

859
00:32:46.255 --> 00:32:47.929
also focuses on letting go

860
00:32:47.929 --> 00:32:49.865
of our identity with the material world

861
00:32:49.865 --> 00:32:52.133
as the path to moving beyond suffering.

862
00:32:52.133 --> 00:32:55.586
Until next time, thanks for watching.
