00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of you have heard
of the entity named Bashar.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.150 align:middle line:84%
This channeled
extraterrestrial is incredibly

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.120 align:middle line:84%
popular with terrestrials
because of his lusty sense

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.770 align:middle line:90%
of humor and directness.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Less is known, however, of the
person through which he speaks.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.880 align:middle line:84%
In 1973, Daryl Anka
witnessed UFOs at close range

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.500 align:middle line:90%
on two occasions.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.350 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that this was not an
earthly craft or experience,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.980 align:middle line:84%
he became curious about UFOs
and about paranormal phenomena.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Through his research, Daryl
learned of channeling.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.840 align:middle line:84%
After experiencing
a telepathic message

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.390 align:middle line:84%
from an ET who called
himself Bashar,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.240 align:middle line:84%
he realized that
Bashar's ship was the one

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.310 align:middle line:90%
he'd seen 10 years earlier.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.710 align:middle line:84%
The rest is history as he
opened his connection up

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.800 align:middle line:84%
to the public for
question after question.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.350 align:middle line:84%
As Bashar's wisdom has
become more widely known

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.750 align:middle line:84%
and respected, Daryl
has become in demand.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.240 align:middle line:84%
But we were lucky enough to
have a few moments with him

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.725 align:middle line:90%
at a recent conference.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad we finally got
a chance to meet, Daryl.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.513 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I've seen you,
and through you, Bashar loads

00:01:04.513 --> 00:01:05.680 align:middle line:90%
and loads through the years.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.050 align:middle line:84%
But I've wanted to talk with
you, Daryl, because this--

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.800 align:middle line:84%
let's just talk
about right now how

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.050 align:middle line:84%
it's coming through you to
the best of your memory--

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.590 align:middle line:90%
I know you've seen the tapes--

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.298 align:middle line:84%
is impacting your own journey
and also what the implications

00:01:21.298 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle line:84%
are for the newest
information coming

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.190 align:middle line:90%
through for the rest of us.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.665 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the information that's
been coming through me from

00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Bashar for 28 years has
certainly made a difference

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.590 align:middle line:90%
in my life emotionally.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.190 align:middle line:84%
It's made me understand
why it's important to act

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.490 align:middle line:90%
on one's excitement.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's really,
at this point,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.990 align:middle line:84%
what I attempt to do in
my life and nothing else.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Because as Bashar
has explained it,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.610 align:middle line:84%
excitement is the
physical translation

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.050 align:middle line:84%
of the frequency of energy
that represents our true self.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea, I
guess, of us being here

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:84%
is to be who we are
to the best we can.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So certainly, I've
learned that lesson,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.420 align:middle line:84%
and I'm always
learning that lesson,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.840 align:middle line:84%
always discovering more
about following my excitement

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.590 align:middle line:90%
and how important that is.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:84%
I think that's also probably
one of the most important things

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.890 align:middle line:84%
that Bashar is talking
about for everyone else

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:84%
as well because that's
really his primary point.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
It is to be who we truly
are, to be true to ourselves.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And he is giving us information
to help us figure out what

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.340 align:middle line:90%
that means and how to do that.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And here we are at the
new the Conscious Living

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.640 align:middle line:84%
expo, where we have
every kind of vendor,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.020 align:middle line:84%
every kind of message under
the sun, under this roof.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Yet, the thing that appeals
to me about what Bashar says

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.660 align:middle line:84%
is what you just mentioned, that
really if we go to that place

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:84%
inside that is truly
excited or delighted

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and those feelings
are coming forth,

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:84%
that's a communication from
us coming through, isn't it?

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely, I mean, I
think the thing that I really

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.900 align:middle line:84%
appreciate the most about
Bashar's information or his

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
style of delivery is he's really
good at grounding metaphysical

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.180 align:middle line:84%
concepts into very physical,
tangible techniques and tools

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and just, for example, the whole
idea that he explains exactly

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.270 align:middle line:84%
what excitement is and why
it's important to follow it

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.120 align:middle line:84%
physically to get
a certain result.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:84%
He just doesn't leave it up
in the air as a nice saying.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.910 align:middle line:90%
He really grounds it in.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:90%
This is what you do.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.330 align:middle line:90%
This is why it works.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.170 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, I think that the
thing he's trying to do

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.350 align:middle line:84%
is give us a toolkit so we
don't always necessarily

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.570 align:middle line:84%
have to go running
to someone else,

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.148 align:middle line:84%
that we know we have the ability
to tap into the information we

00:03:38.148 --> 00:03:39.940 align:middle line:84%
need from our own higher
selves, and Bashar

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.200 align:middle line:84%
is acting as an example of
what it's like to communicate

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:90%
with our own higher selves.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he's
actually directly said

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.070 align:middle line:84%
that when we're
talking with him he's

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.200 align:middle line:84%
sort of tricking us
because he's allowing

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.390 align:middle line:90%
himself to be used as a mask.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.670 align:middle line:84%
But when people are receiving
information from him

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle line:84%
they're actually speaking
to their own higher selves,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and he's training them to get
used to what that feels like,

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.800 align:middle line:84%
what that sounds like, so they
know they always have access

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.270 align:middle line:84%
to the answers and
the information

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.900 align:middle line:84%
that they need to
live their lives.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.928 align:middle line:84%
>> So is he then in
communication with the higher

00:04:11.928 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:84%
aspect of that person as
they're answering the question

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and essentially reflecting back
their own information to them?

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.227 align:middle line:84%
>> That's exactly
what he's doing.

00:04:18.227 --> 00:04:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it makes sense.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So he's you used
to that frequency.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.982 align:middle line:84%
And that way when you're
not in his presence,

00:04:24.982 --> 00:04:26.440 align:middle line:84%
you can still know
that if you just

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.240 align:middle line:84%
remember what that
felt like you'll

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.220 align:middle line:84%
be back in exactly
the same vibration

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.000 align:middle line:90%
and can get that information.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the feeling
your way back,

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.340 align:middle line:84%
throughout my
25-30 year journey,

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.440 align:middle line:84%
it's always feeling
your way back into it.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.310 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to remember, hard
to even put pictures up.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not the same.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, different people
are wired differently.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's like however
you need to get back

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.350 align:middle line:84%
to that state that
represents the ability

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.860 align:middle line:84%
to access that information
or your ideal state, whatever

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.590 align:middle line:84%
path works for you,
basically, is OK.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:90%
Some of us feel our way back.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of us can imagine
or picture our way back.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.365 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it takes
to get you there,

00:05:02.365 --> 00:05:03.490 align:middle line:90%
that's the important thing.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.698 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, as long as there's
a click at the other end.

00:05:05.698 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about the
difference between excitement,

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.270 align:middle line:84%
as in mania, versus what
he's talking about in terms

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:90%
of feeling and excitement.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean, excitement
can be physically jumping up

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.400 align:middle line:90%
and down.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.483 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't have to be.

00:05:20.483 --> 00:05:23.945 align:middle line:84%
Even a state of balanced peace
can be a state of excitement.

00:05:23.945 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:84%
It's really being
centered and balanced

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.950 align:middle line:84%
is what he's talking
about and being in a flow.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.470 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about
that idea of when

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.095 align:middle line:84%
you do something you
love to do and you

00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:84%
don't notice the passage of
time that's that state that he's

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.380 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.280 align:middle line:84%
When you're being your true
self, it's that state of flow.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.040 align:middle line:84%
It's the state of letting
everything, allowing everything

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:84%
to work instead of trying
to make everything work.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:45.530 align:middle line:90%
And we all do it.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:84%
We all have the ability
to get into that state.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And as he sometimes
uses, for example,

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:84%
when an actor becomes
the character, when

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.040 align:middle line:84%
a singer is lost in the song,
that's a channeling state.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.600 align:middle line:90%
That's that state of excitement.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.940 align:middle line:84%
That's being present,
totally present

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and just letting the
creativity flow through you

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.560 align:middle line:84%
without thinking
your way through it.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.180 align:middle line:84%
We all have the ability to
do that in some way, shape,

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.980 align:middle line:90%
or form.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And he's saying it's critical
we do this for ourselves,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.610 align:middle line:90%
but particularly now, why?

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>> This is, in his view,
the age of transformation.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the timing when we chose
to have lives where we learn

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.970 align:middle line:84%
to change the dark
to the light, where

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:84%
that's the kind of world
we say we want to have.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So now it's kind of
time to walk the talk

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and actually put it out
there in our own lives

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.600 align:middle line:84%
and act as examples
of what it means

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.900 align:middle line:84%
to live the life you prefer
to live and to create

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.790 align:middle line:90%
the world we prefer to create.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is the very
time accelerated energy

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:90%
is available to us.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Now that we have these
ideas, now that we're

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.140 align:middle line:84%
talking about these things,
now that it's common language

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.990 align:middle line:84%
to talk about such
things as altered states

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.920 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
expansion of consciousness,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.070 align:middle line:84%
now's the time to put all
that to work in a sense.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I heard that one of the
last questions asked today,

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.930 align:middle line:84%
which you may or
may not remember,

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.640 align:middle line:84%
was someone was asking about
something having to do with

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.440 align:middle line:90%
the future human.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.273 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking
about into the future.

00:07:12.273 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And Bashar was
talking about how he

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.100 align:middle line:84%
has very similar hybridized-DNA
to us, the human species,

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.650 align:middle line:84%
but represents more what
would be happening 1,000

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.780 align:middle line:84%
years into the future, where
we are becoming less physical,

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.040 align:middle line:84%
where we are not eating
food and drinking water.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And what have you learned
through these channelings

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:40.710 align:middle line:84%
about some of the development
we'll need to go through?

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean we're here now.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.560 align:middle line:84%
I get the feeling, feeling
our way into who we are.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.320 align:middle line:84%
But between here
and there, what have

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.050 align:middle line:84%
you seen as some of
the stages because we

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.240 align:middle line:84%
have all different kinds
of humans incarnating now.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Some are kind of moving
that direction already.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yeah, and this is
the beginning of that kind

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.860 align:middle line:90%
of evolution or transformation.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's just
basically a continuation

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.160 align:middle line:90%
and an acceleration of that.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.910 align:middle line:84%
As Bashar says, positive
energy is integrative

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.640 align:middle line:90%
and exponentially accelerative.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So even though it may have
taken us 50 or a 100,000 years

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.290 align:middle line:84%
to get where we are, it's not
going to take us that long

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.800 align:middle line:90%
to get where they are.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Because once we
accelerate together,

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.220 align:middle line:84%
all that momentum creates
a geometric progression

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.510 align:middle line:84%
that allows more and more and
more of that kind of reality

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.310 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.970 align:middle line:84%
So the more we
live in the moment,

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:37.010 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, the less
time we need to change.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.125 align:middle line:84%
And here even at
this conference,

00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:42.000 align:middle line:84%
you're hearing about a
lot of different kinds

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
stories, lots.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are more along
the lines of fear generated.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And what does he have
to say to us about that?

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Because we're so
conflicted and confused

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:56.040 align:middle line:84%
over accepting the presence
of extraterrestrials.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean,
that's a big subject.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there's a lot of
different ways to address it.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:84%
But he usually chooses to
address it on a personal level.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.030 align:middle line:84%
In other words, no matter
what's going on around you,

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:84%
if you stay in the vibrational
state of your preference, that

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.850 align:middle line:84%
will color how whatever
happens affects you personally

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:15.970 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you stay in a positive
state, a loving state

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.570 align:middle line:84%
and give that off, no matter
what anyone else's intention

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.120 align:middle line:84%
toward you may be,
the only effect

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:84%
that that interaction
will have in your life

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.380 align:middle line:90%
will be a positive one.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.010 align:middle line:84%
He has said that,
for the most part,

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.640 align:middle line:84%
most of those interactions
are generally positive

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and, for a positive
reason ultimately,

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.818 align:middle line:84%
aiding and assisting us
with our own evolution.

00:09:37.818 --> 00:09:39.360 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless,
it still comes down

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.780 align:middle line:84%
to how you choose to experience
it based on your own vibration.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>> What does he say about the
notion of the whole what people

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.660 align:middle line:84%
call abductee experience which
is taking on many flavors now,

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:49.860 align:middle line:90%
good, bad, and indifferent?

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.220 align:middle line:90%
>> The short story--

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.485 align:middle line:84%
and I understand there's
many nuances and many ways

00:09:53.485 --> 00:09:55.110 align:middle line:84%
that different people
experience this--

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.070 align:middle line:84%
but the short story
is it is something

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.040 align:middle line:84%
that we have agreed
to do on some level

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and that we are participating
in a larger program that

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.690 align:middle line:84%
is aiding and
assisting our evolution

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.810 align:middle line:84%
as well as aiding and assisting
the evolution of those beings

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.150 align:middle line:84%
as well because
Bashar is actually

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.660 align:middle line:84%
one of the results of the
hybridization that seems to be

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.300 align:middle line:90%
going on in those experiences.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And so in a sense, we're
getting the benefit

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.010 align:middle line:84%
of that hybridization
program that we're

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.620 align:middle line:84%
participating in and helping
to create those hybrid beings.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.070 align:middle line:10%
They're coming back to us and
helping pull us up the ladder,

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.760 align:middle line:10%
so to speak, because in a
sense they're our descendants.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're treating
us as their ancestors.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.000 align:middle line:90%
They're treating us as family.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And they want to help us
understand the big picture

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.490 align:middle line:84%
that we're a part of and
that they're a part of so

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.050 align:middle line:84%
that we start seeing
ourselves more

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.480 align:middle line:84%
as a part of a kind
of a galactic family

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.553 align:middle line:90%
instead of being so isolated.

00:10:47.553 --> 00:10:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I interviewed
someone recently,

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.387 align:middle line:84%
and they were talking about
their experience and over time

00:10:51.387 --> 00:10:54.130 align:middle line:84%
have learned to kind of
assimilate it on a different

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:54.930 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.030 align:middle line:84%
They've met with
their own children

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:01.100 align:middle line:84%
on the other side, vast array
of experiments, some gone wrong,

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:84%
some are perfect, but the point
being when they did present her

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.080 align:middle line:84%
with this one child that
was pretty intact human

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.440 align:middle line:84%
but with a higher intelligence,
compassionate heart,

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.610 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing this woman
will be incarnating back

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:17.460 align:middle line:90%
into that line.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.830 align:middle line:84%
So the DNA has to be
part of the continuum.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's not like--

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.472 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking
about the possibility

00:11:23.472 --> 00:11:26.420 align:middle line:84%
also of many different
lines of extraterrestrials.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, what's going on with
the Greys is only one thing.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And as Bashar has
explained it, they're

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.890 align:middle line:84%
not even really
extraterrestrials.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.710 align:middle line:84%
He has explained,
his view of what

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.450 align:middle line:84%
that certain
faction of Greys are

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.130 align:middle line:84%
is they're actually
mutated humans

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.523 align:middle line:84%
from a parallel earth who
have destroyed their world

00:11:43.523 --> 00:11:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and have now realized
that the only thing they

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.320 align:middle line:84%
can do to save themselves
is take viable human DNA

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.400 align:middle line:84%
from our reality to
create a hybrid species

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.640 align:middle line:84%
so their civilization
will continue.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.260 align:middle line:84%
But out of that, we get the
help of the hybrid species

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:84%
to help us make sure we
don't do the same things they

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:03.160 align:middle line:90%
did to their earth.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very interesting story
that's very, very connected

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of ways.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you see
more the human--

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.470 align:middle line:84%
well as you say, humanoid types
of ETs, which I assume Bashar

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:14.270 align:middle line:90%
is one.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And a lot of times people
are in fear thinking but I

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.817 align:middle line:84%
don't want to end
up like a Grey.

00:12:19.817 --> 00:12:21.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is just
human fear and emotions.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think that
they necessarily have to.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.285 align:middle line:84%
But again it's all
about choices that

00:12:26.285 --> 00:12:28.910 align:middle line:84%
are made on different
level and the trusting

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.030 align:middle line:84%
that whatever the result of
those choices are somehow

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:90%
benefits us.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I didn't mean to
say that flippantly,

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.910 align:middle line:84%
but they're are people
afraid of that very thing.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.578 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that
the Greys are flawless.

00:12:38.578 --> 00:12:40.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, there are
different levels of species

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:84%
all over the place, and they may
have their things to work out.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And it may require that we teach
them some things as well as

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:47.638 align:middle line:90%
them teaching us some things.

00:12:47.638 --> 00:12:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Does Bashar say this
is reciprocal at all?

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.650 align:middle line:90%
Or is he mostly--

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:53.150 align:middle line:90%
is it a one-way broadcast?

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Is he learning anything
by observing us?

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.032 align:middle line:84%
>> He is always learning
by observing us.

00:12:57.032 --> 00:12:58.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's one
of the reasons why

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.380 align:middle line:84%
they call us the
masters of limitation

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.590 align:middle line:84%
as an affectionate sort
of a nickname for us.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.270 align:middle line:84%
It is because in
their world they

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:08.190 align:middle line:84%
don't get to experience the kind
of things we experience here

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.190 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have
the same kinds of focus,

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.875 align:middle line:90%
the same kinds of limitations.

00:13:11.875 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, they're saying
rather than think of us

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.570 align:middle line:84%
as a kindergarten, they see us
as a master graduating class

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:21.590 align:middle line:84%
because we're strong enough to
actually come here and place

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:84%
upon ourselves,
impose on ourselves,

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.030 align:middle line:84%
the vast amount of
limitations that we do

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.370 align:middle line:84%
and still find our
way to the light.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.125 align:middle line:84%
So they really see us
as master teachers,

00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:31.250 align:middle line:90%
and they're learning a lot.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Because they're saying
basically if we can do it,

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:34.610 align:middle line:90%
anyone can do it.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.910 align:middle line:84%
So we act as an example
to other civilizations who

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:40.550 align:middle line:84%
may be having problems, maybe
not quite as difficult as we

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.400 align:middle line:84%
are, and they point
us out to them

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.650 align:middle line:84%
and say look what they
were able to transform.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, if they can transform
that degree of limitation,

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:50.260 align:middle line:90%
yours should be a snap.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because that duality
is something that doesn't seem

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.400 align:middle line:84%
to happen everywhere, this
dual nature of the human being.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Not the same
experience of it.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:84%
I think there is
duality, but I don't

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:84%
think that other places
experience the choices

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.983 align:middle line:90%
of duality that we make.

00:14:03.983 --> 00:14:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And the pure amnesia of not
understanding what we truly

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:06.660 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I think more children
nowadays though are,

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.090 align:middle line:84%
because of this new age, being
born with more memory of who

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:12.890 align:middle line:90%
they are.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.220 align:middle line:90%
They're not forgetting as much.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.637 align:middle line:84%
And that's part
of the change too.

00:14:15.637 --> 00:14:18.362 align:middle line:90%


00:14:18.362 --> 00:14:23.182 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:23.182 --> 00:14:27.540 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:34.000 align:middle line:10%
Let us begin with
the idea of creating

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.540 align:middle line:10%
a scenario in your imagination.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.330 align:middle line:10%
Most of you with regard to
any endeavor that you choose

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:44.280 align:middle line:10%
to do, with regard to anything
you may prefer to do in life,

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.050 align:middle line:10%
will in your imagination
conjure up an image,

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.760 align:middle line:10%
a picture, a scenario.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.980 align:middle line:10%
Now, as we have said, and as
we will remind you once again

00:14:54.980 --> 00:15:01.510 align:middle line:10%
right now, any image that your
physical mind can conjure up

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:05.920 align:middle line:10%
may not necessarily be as
fully representative of the way

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:11.800 align:middle line:10%
something can manifest, but
it will function as a symbol,

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.890 align:middle line:10%
as a place holder,
as a representation

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.020 align:middle line:10%
of the manifestation
of the ideal scenario.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.010 align:middle line:10%


00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.140 align:middle line:10%
Recognizing that
your higher mind is

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.860 align:middle line:10%
far more capable of knowing
how something will happen,

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.630 align:middle line:10%
how something will manifest
and your physical mind is not

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.960 align:middle line:10%
capable of knowing
how that will happen,

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:10%
the idea is to
recognize and to use

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:45.060 align:middle line:10%
the limitation of the physical
mind to your advantage.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.950 align:middle line:10%
Using the limitation
to your advantage

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:50.190 align:middle line:10%
means that when your
physical mind conjures up

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.920 align:middle line:10%
an image, or a
representation, or a symbol

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:56.760 align:middle line:10%
of your ideal scenario
toward any given intention

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:02.160 align:middle line:10%
you may have in life, it means
that you do not necessarily

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.150 align:middle line:10%
have to limit
yourself to the image

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.640 align:middle line:10%
that your imagination, your
physical mind's imagination,

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.280 align:middle line:10%
is capable of creating.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:18.470 align:middle line:10%
You can rely on your higher
mind to create for itself

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:21.830 align:middle line:10%
a higher version
representation, a higher version

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.800 align:middle line:10%
image, a higher
version symbol that it

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.963 align:middle line:10%
will use to attract to you all
the different synchronicities,

00:16:29.963 --> 00:16:32.630 align:middle line:10%
all the different opportunities,
all the different circumstances

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:37.840 align:middle line:10%
and situations required
for the highest

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:10%
form of that representation,
the highest vibration

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:42.820 align:middle line:10%
of that representation.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.430 align:middle line:10%
And thus, you don't
have to work so

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:50.245 align:middle line:10%
hard at insisting and
focusing on the idea

00:16:50.245 --> 00:16:52.120 align:middle line:10%
that the image you have
in your physical mind

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:56.660 align:middle line:10%
must exactly and precisely
come to fruition.

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.096 align:middle line:10%
Now, it might.

00:16:58.096 --> 00:17:01.510 align:middle line:10%
It might be that
sometimes from time

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:03.880 align:middle line:10%
to time, the higher
mind and physical mind

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.410 align:middle line:10%
will recognize that according to
the synchronicity in your life,

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:10%
the image that you have
in your physical mind

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.770 align:middle line:10%
may be for that moment the
most ideal representation,

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:19.030 align:middle line:10%
the most appropriate, the
most relevant representation

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.160 align:middle line:10%
of that manifestation
of your intention.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:27.030 align:middle line:10%
But very often, and
more often than not,

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:30.560 align:middle line:10%
your higher mind is quite
capable of bringing to you

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:36.380 align:middle line:10%
a version of what you intend, a
version of your ideal scenario,

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.670 align:middle line:10%
that may even be much
greater than what

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.920 align:middle line:10%
you were capable of imagining
with your physical mind.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:47.020 align:middle line:10%
And thus, it will
benefit you to not

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.650 align:middle line:10%
insist that the picture your
mind is capable of conjuring

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:10%
be the only way that that
ideal reality can occur,

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:58.650 align:middle line:10%
can manifest, can
come to fruition.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.580 align:middle line:10%
To be able to relax
your insistence

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.310 align:middle line:10%
on that picture being
the only representation

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.820 align:middle line:10%
will benefit you and
allow your higher mind

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.600 align:middle line:10%
to do its job while your
physical mind does its job so

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.340 align:middle line:10%
that you can work
together in harmony

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.760 align:middle line:10%
and concert between the
physical and higher mind, which,

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.710 align:middle line:10%
when you do that,
allows you to function

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:24.420 align:middle line:10%
in your physical reality
as a whole person.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.700 align:middle line:10%
If you only use
your physical mind,

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.485 align:middle line:10%
you're not functioning
as a whole person.

00:18:29.485 --> 00:18:31.110 align:middle line:10%
In order to function
as a whole person,

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.760 align:middle line:10%
you must allow the
higher mind to be

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.840 align:middle line:10%
part of the conversation,
part of the manifestation,

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.710 align:middle line:10%
because it is uniquely
designed to see much farther

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.960 align:middle line:10%
than the physical mind can see.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.505 align:middle line:10%
The analogy we
have often used is

00:18:44.505 --> 00:18:46.410 align:middle line:10%
that the physical
mind is in the valley,

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.730 align:middle line:10%
and the higher mind
is on the mountaintop.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:51.900 align:middle line:10%
So it can see much farther
than the physical mind can

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.200 align:middle line:10%
below in the valley and
can guide you and tell you

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.040 align:middle line:10%
which way to turn.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:10%
Even though to the
physical mind it

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.620 align:middle line:10%
may seem that when the higher
mind says turn left, turn

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.380 align:middle line:10%
right, go straight, it may
make no sense according

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.240 align:middle line:10%
to what the physical
mind can see,

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.660 align:middle line:10%
to what the physical mind
intends, relying and trusting

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.760 align:middle line:10%
in the higher mind's
ability to see farther

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.707 align:middle line:10%
than the physical mind
will allow you to find out,

00:19:14.707 --> 00:19:16.290 align:middle line:10%
will allow you to
discover, will allow

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:19.270 align:middle line:10%
you to experience
that even though it

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:21.430 align:middle line:10%
may seem to be
twisting and turning,

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:25.450 align:middle line:10%
it will actually be the
quickest path to your intention

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:26.650 align:middle line:10%
to what you desire.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:31.390 align:middle line:10%
Because it knows, it knows
what that path really is

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.610 align:middle line:10%
and what you need
on that path and how

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.800 align:middle line:10%
you can incorporate
what you discover on

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:41.230 align:middle line:10%
that path into a greater
appreciation for the scenario

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:45.160 align:middle line:10%
when it manifests, giving you
all the tools you need along

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.480 align:middle line:10%
the way to more fully appreciate
and use the scenario when it

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.690 align:middle line:10%
manifests, gathering
as you go what

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.300 align:middle line:10%
you need for that experience.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.540 align:middle line:10%
That's why it's so important
to allow yourself to recognize

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.440 align:middle line:10%
that whatever is happening
is part of your excitement

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:07.570 align:middle line:10%
and not an obstacle to it or
not an interruption of it.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:12.730 align:middle line:10%
Now, the idea also
of this scenario

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:10%
that your physical mind
paints a picture of

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.720 align:middle line:10%
is primarily, as we have said,
for the purpose of instilling

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:24.520 align:middle line:10%
a state of being within you,
a particular energy vibration

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.780 align:middle line:10%
within you.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.730 align:middle line:10%
Because that state
of being is what's

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:31.770 align:middle line:10%
representative of the
manifestation of that scenario.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:34.870 align:middle line:10%
It is not the image that's
representative necessarily.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:37.210 align:middle line:10%
It's the state of being
that goes along with it.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:40.860 align:middle line:10%
It's when you see that
picture of your ideal scenario

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:45.310 align:middle line:10%
and you living that ideal
scenario of your intention.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:10%
It's the feeling that goes
with it of excitement.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.460 align:middle line:10%
It's the feeling of
certitude that goes with it.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.220 align:middle line:10%
It's the feeling of knowing
that that's who you are

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:10%
and knowing that that's an
actual reality experience.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.470 align:middle line:10%
That is what is key.

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:01.410 align:middle line:10%
And it is that vibrational
state that the picture

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:05.700 align:middle line:10%
is designed to attract
you into, to magnetize you

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.850 align:middle line:10%
to that vibrational
state represented

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.770 align:middle line:10%
by that symbolic picture.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.630 align:middle line:10%
Because when you're
in that state,

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.210 align:middle line:10%
then you open up the
conduit of your imagination

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.150 align:middle line:10%
and synchronicity sufficiently
to allow the higher

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:22.020 align:middle line:10%
mind to then, in a sense,
download to you the way

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.960 align:middle line:10%
in which the scenario
really needs to happen,

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.870 align:middle line:10%
the form it really needs to
take to be representative

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.800 align:middle line:10%
of that state of being that the
physical picture has allowed

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.130 align:middle line:10%
you to find yourself
to resonate with.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.540 align:middle line:10%
That's what it's for.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:41.100 align:middle line:10%
So relaxing your insistence
that the image must be exactly

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.520 align:middle line:10%
as you picture it will open you
up to many more possibilities

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:49.740 align:middle line:10%
and probabilities about how the
actual scenario could manifest.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.490 align:middle line:10%
And as often we have said,
what to the physical mind

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:57.990 align:middle line:10%
may seem to be the ceiling is to
the higher mind just the floor.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:00.090 align:middle line:10%
And you are not capable
with the physical mind

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:03.300 align:middle line:10%
of imagining all the ways the
higher mind can actually bring

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.910 align:middle line:10%
you what it is you desire.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:07.080 align:middle line:10%
So be open.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.270 align:middle line:10%
Let all the doors remain open.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:middle line:10%
It might manifest exactly
as you've seen it,

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.450 align:middle line:10%
but it might not.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:15.360 align:middle line:10%
And joy, joy, joy,
and excitement to you

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.790 align:middle line:10%
if you get the unexpected.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.920 align:middle line:10%
Allow the unexpected to come.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.690 align:middle line:10%
Be open to the unexpected.

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:23.610 align:middle line:10%
For you will then
allow the higher mind

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:27.060 align:middle line:10%
