00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Max Gerson was a man
decades ahead of his time.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Even today, his methods
of healing cancer

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.330 align:middle line:84%
would be subjected to ridicule
by the medical industry.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.220 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is
he was reversing

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.480 align:middle line:84%
cancer and many other lethal
diseases from the 1920s on.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.760 align:middle line:84%
His work became so
well-known that he testified

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.280 align:middle line:84%
before Congress with his
healed patients by his side,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.810 align:middle line:84%
but his work was buried and
obscured by the powers that be.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Since his death in 1959, his
daughter Charlotte Gerson

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.750 align:middle line:84%
has kept the work alive
and has expanded on it

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.607 align:middle line:84%
in spite of harassment
by the medical community.

00:00:39.607 --> 00:00:43.990 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.252 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.252 --> 00:00:50.710 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking off camera
while Scott's been setting up

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.070 align:middle line:90%
the lights and so forth.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And we've already talked about
so much that should be on tape.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:90%
I want to recapture some of it.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Because the reality is, you've
been around the cancer industry

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.560 align:middle line:90%
for 60-some years now, right?

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Probably more.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Because from the time I was
tall enough or big enough

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.980 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
was going on--

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.280 align:middle line:84%
I was maybe seven or eight
years old, maybe nine--

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.030 align:middle line:84%
I knew how my father
was always in the middle

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.800 align:middle line:90%
of being attacked.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.960 align:middle line:90%
First, it wasn't cancer.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:84%
It didn't get to be cancer
until he came into this country

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.870 align:middle line:84%
when he was seriously
getting involved with cancer.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.310 align:middle line:84%
But before that,
he cured a woman

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.880 align:middle line:84%
who was totally stiff
with rheumatoid arthritis.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.890 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't even open
her mouth to chew.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.240 align:middle line:84%
They had to put a
tube and there so she

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.510 align:middle line:90%
could even get some food.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And after he treated her
for a year, she was dancing.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:90%
They attacked him for that!

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Oh, he only did it for
publicity, for advertising.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.510 align:middle line:90%
So why don't you advertise?

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>> They think of some
stupid things to say.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, to discredit
it for obvious reasons,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.790 align:middle line:84%
there is a machine that is
well oiled called "the medical

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.520 align:middle line:84%
industry," "medical industrial
complex," as it were.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Now by the way, I
want to say thank

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.259 align:middle line:84%
you so much for joining us
and letting us join you today.

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:16.840 align:middle line:90%
It's your 87th birthday.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.980 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at your skin--

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.940 align:middle line:84%
everything about you
is spry, and lively,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:90%
and exudes good health.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.670 align:middle line:90%
So happy birthday.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] So
you said this is--

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:84%
since you were about nine years
old-- that would make it, oh,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.240 align:middle line:90%
gosh 79 years ago--

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.190 align:middle line:84%
that's a long
time, that this has

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.850 align:middle line:84%
been under attack from your
personal observational level.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at what your
father was doing, even back

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.070 align:middle line:84%
in the '40s, where
he was actually

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.610 align:middle line:84%
becoming known for his work and
had published papers by 1945.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:90%
What had happened?

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.970 align:middle line:84%
What had he shown
up to that time?

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And he did testify
in front of Congress,

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:90%
so this was public record.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.720 align:middle line:90%


00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>> For one, he did not
set out to cure cancer.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.780 align:middle line:90%
He had no idea about cancer.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.670 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, my own
grandmother, his mother-in-law,

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.090 align:middle line:84%
developed breast cancer when
she had surgeries and spread

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.170 align:middle line:90%
to her brain and died.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.130 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't help her.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.320 align:middle line:84%
He didn't owe anything,
what to do with cancer.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.300 align:middle line:84%
However, he was treating
other chronic diseases.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.260 align:middle line:90%
He didn't see a connection, OK?

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.390 align:middle line:90%
It took an unusual case--

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and he describes
that in his book,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.820 align:middle line:84%
in the Gerson cancer
therapy book--

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:84%
that he even found out
that, with the therapy,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.270 align:middle line:84%
with good nutrition,
with the right food,

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.080 align:middle line:90%
somebody could recover.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:84%
This opened his
eyes and his mind.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.350 align:middle line:90%
He had no idea.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Later, when he was curing
advanced tuberculosis--

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and he wasn't touching
cancer at that time.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.990 align:middle line:90%
It was just a wild idea.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
He was treating
patients, and he only

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.460 align:middle line:84%
accepted those
that were certified

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.565 align:middle line:84%
by three top authorities to
be dying and uninfluencable.

00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>> In other words, go home,
make yourself comfortable,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.280 align:middle line:90%
you're dying.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Lung tuberculosis.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:35.170 align:middle line:84%
When he cured those, he noted
that some had allergies,

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.433 align:middle line:84%
some had other diseases,
some had kidney damage,

00:04:38.433 --> 00:04:39.850 align:middle line:84%
some had high blood
pressure, some

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.040 align:middle line:90%
had various other diseases.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.930 align:middle line:90%
And those two disappeared.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's where he parted
company with orthodox medicine.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.630 align:middle line:84%
He was trained like
every other doctor--

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.815 align:middle line:84%
you would treat,
you'd diagnose, you

00:04:52.815 --> 00:04:55.690 align:middle line:84%
would treat that particular
disease with a drug,

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.050 align:middle line:84%
or a surgery, whatever
is necessary, OK?

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.170 align:middle line:84%
But he realized
for the first time

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:84%
ever that when you are
able to restore and heal--

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.200 align:middle line:84%
give the body the
nutrients to heal--

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.090 align:middle line:90%
the body heals everything.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.110 align:middle line:90%
You cannot heal selectively.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.910 align:middle line:90%
That's true today.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, yes, it
makes perfect sense.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.360 align:middle line:84%
How did your father
come across this?

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.925 align:middle line:84%
Were these his own
personal habits?

00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:24.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>> So he was into--

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.545 align:middle line:90%
>> He was very sick!

00:05:27.545 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>> He was sick?

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>> He had very severe migraine
headaches that kept him in bed

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.370 align:middle line:84%
sometimes two and three days
a week in darkened rooms,

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.390 align:middle line:90%
vomiting, nausea the side--

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.780 align:middle line:90%
half side, you know--

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.640 align:middle line:84%
brain-- headaches-- and
he couldn't function.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And he asked his professors,
his doctors, his teachers,

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.190 align:middle line:84%
they said, well,
just read it up.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.060 align:middle line:90%
There's no cure.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.155 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel better
when you're 55.

00:05:55.155 --> 00:05:57.680 align:middle line:90%
But I'm 25.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.270 align:middle line:90%
I can't live like this.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.720 align:middle line:84%
He decided he has to
find a cure for himself.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.460 align:middle line:90%
That's why he set out.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.740 align:middle line:90%
And it took a long time.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.410 align:middle line:84%
He saw many doctors,
professors, teachers.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.460 align:middle line:84%
He saw all kinds of people,
and combed the literature,

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and had things translated
for him until, one day, he

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:25.370 align:middle line:84%
found one little paper for a
little unknown journal that

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.800 align:middle line:84%
reported on a woman
who had changed a diet

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:90%
and her migraines got better.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.920 align:middle line:90%
Diet?

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:90%
Never heard anything like that.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.660 align:middle line:90%
Food?

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.785 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's for the cook
in the kitchen, you know?

00:06:35.785 --> 00:06:36.770 align:middle line:90%
That's not for doctors.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:37.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:37.746 --> 00:06:40.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>> So anyway, diet.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.570 align:middle line:84%
So he figured, well, maybe
I'm allergic to something.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.790 align:middle line:90%
That's possible.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Every baby can digest milk.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.860 align:middle line:90%
I should try milk.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:90%
I'll digest milk.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.760 align:middle line:84%
But you know exactly
what happened.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.240 align:middle line:84%
He took nothing but milk for
several days, a week or so,

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.050 align:middle line:90%
and he was as sick as ever.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And then it occurred
to him that nowhere

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.150 align:middle line:84%
in nature once an
animal is weaned

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.460 align:middle line:84%
do they ever drink
milk ever again,

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.870 align:middle line:84%
and certainly not milk
from a different species.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.780 align:middle line:90%
So he said, no, that's not it.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Our, let's call it,
physiological ancestor so

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.500 align:middle line:84%
we don't step on any
religious toes here--

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.320 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:30.830 align:middle line:84%
the simian animals that
have a certain resemblance--

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.990 align:middle line:84%
once they are weaned,
they eat vegetarian.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:84%
They eat seeds, and nuts,
and greens, and leaves,

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.230 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing-- roots.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:49.040 align:middle line:84%
So he started in Germany,
always very plentiful apples.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And as he ate nothing but
apples-- cooked apples,

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:84%
and baked apples, and
applesauce, and raw apples,

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.100 align:middle line:90%
and apple juice--

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.770 align:middle line:90%
all apples, he was fine.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.550 align:middle line:84%
On that knowledge, he
built what he could eat.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.070 align:middle line:84%
He would add one
thing at a time.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.470 align:middle line:90%
If it agreed with him, fine.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.950 align:middle line:84%
If it didn't, he could have
a migraine in 20 minutes.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:17.680 align:middle line:84%
So he built up what he
called his "migraine diet."

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And he was convinced it
was only for migraines

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.440 align:middle line:84%
until a patient came to him
complaining of migraines.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.500 align:middle line:90%
And he had been postdoctoral.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.300 align:middle line:84%
After his medical
training, he had

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:39.285 align:middle line:84%
worked with a top-notch
professor, professors

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:46.150 align:middle line:84%
in Breslau, in Germany,
a name will come to me,

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:84%
and he was a neurosurgeon,
one of the top ones in Europe.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.270 align:middle line:84%
So his shinge, my
father's shingle

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:57.050 align:middle line:84%
read, "internal and
nerve diseases."

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:00.180 align:middle line:84%
So this patient comes
to him with migraines,

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.780 align:middle line:84%
internal disease, and
uses the migraine diet,

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:09.580 align:middle line:84%
which my father says, all
the books say it's incurable.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.300 align:middle line:84%
I have migraine, and I'm
using this, and it helps me.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.810 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you try it?

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.710 align:middle line:84%
He never claimed it
would cure anything.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, the guy comes
back three, four weeks later,

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.990 align:middle line:84%
and he says, yes,
Dr. Gerson, I'm fine,

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.300 align:middle line:90%
and I have no more migraines.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.350 align:middle line:84%
But I also had
skin tuberculosis.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.020 align:middle line:90%
It's called lupus vulgaris.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And they find TB
germs in the lesions.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's cured, too.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:84%
My father said, no, no, no,
must have been something else.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.790 align:middle line:90%
This is an incurable disease.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:46.360 align:middle line:84%
But the guy pulled
out records from labs

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.830 align:middle line:84%
that showed clearly that his
lesions had tubercle bacilli.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.680 align:middle line:90%
Let me see that.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:90%
He had no idea.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
well, my shingle

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.392 align:middle line:90%
said, "internal nerve disease."

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:84%
This a skin-- it's
not an internal.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.660 align:middle line:90%
It's an external disease.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.190 align:middle line:90%
Do you know anybody else?

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Oh, sure, the hospital
where I lived--

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:13.540 align:middle line:90%
where I was taken care of.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.850 align:middle line:84%
My father said, look,
please send me some--

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.270 align:middle line:90%
I'll treat them free of charge.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.540 align:middle line:90%
I just want to know.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, he
sent other patients.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, they
got the migraine diet.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
they were cured.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, that opened a new idea.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And this came to the ears of
a famous lung tuberculosis

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:40.722 align:middle line:84%
specialist, [INAUDIBLE],,
that neurologist,

00:10:40.722 --> 00:10:42.680 align:middle line:84%
where he was studying--
his name was Forrester.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, Forrester.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:53.310 align:middle line:84%
All right, so this too-notch
tuberculosis specialist,

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:57.420 align:middle line:84%
his name was [INAUDIBLE],,
Ferdinand [INAUDIBLE],,

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.130 align:middle line:90%
well recognized.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And he heard about skin
tuberculosis healing.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
I want to see that.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And he asked my
father to come to him.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.330 align:middle line:90%
He was a professional.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.580 align:middle line:84%
My father was just a
little country doctor.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he demanded that
my father come to him.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so my father
traveled there.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.890 align:middle line:90%
He went to Munich.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And in those days,
you didn't fly.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:27.090 align:middle line:84%
This was in the early
1920s and talked about it.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:31.460 align:middle line:90%
And he said, OK, we'll test it.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And he took 450 seriously ill
advanced skin tuberculosis

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:42.350 align:middle line:84%
patients to try this
diet therapy, which

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.458 align:middle line:90%
he didn't believe, of course.

00:11:45.458 --> 00:11:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>> 450.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.380 align:middle line:90%
How many of them--

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>> He said if only one improves,
I'll believe every word you

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.060 align:middle line:90%
say.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.220 align:middle line:90%
446 were cured.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] OK.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>> And father--

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.985 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:02.985 --> 00:12:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>> That threw him.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.930 align:middle line:84%
But my father said, hey,
if with nutrition you

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:13.760 align:middle line:84%
can cure skin tuberculosis,
what about other forms of TB?

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And people who are dying
of lung tuberculosis

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and bone tuberculosis,
and syphilitic, and other.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.490 align:middle line:84%
It attacks any
organ in the body.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:22.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a germ.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Being a germ, it means the
immune system is weak, OK?

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.690 align:middle line:90%
So my father went on from there.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:36.640 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't satisfied with
the skin tuberculosis,

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.460 align:middle line:84%
although he should have
gotten the Nobel Prize for it.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Because the guy who discovered
the cause got the Nobel Prize.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.126 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:12:44.126 --> 00:12:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And he was the
first one to hear it.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.535 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:12:48.535 --> 00:12:54.886 align:middle line:84%
>> On the other hand, he
was sued by other doctors.

00:12:54.886 --> 00:12:57.205 align:middle line:84%
>> This doesn't
surprise us today.

00:12:57.205 --> 00:13:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Because, you see, his shingle
read, internal never diseases.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.333 align:middle line:90%
This wasn't internal.

00:13:02.333 --> 00:13:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't that amazing?

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>> He was sued.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>> The small-mindedness and
pettiness in competition.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>> In those days, the judge was
a little bit more open-minded.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.430 align:middle line:84%
He said, he asked all of
these assembled doctors,

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.500 align:middle line:90%
can you skin tuberculosis?

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.000 align:middle line:90%
Can you?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.350 align:middle line:90%
Can you?

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:20.970 align:middle line:90%
Can you?

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:21.280 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.697 align:middle line:84%
Well, why don't
you let him do it?

00:13:22.697 --> 00:13:24.935 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] I love it.

00:13:24.935 --> 00:13:25.735 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:25.735 --> 00:13:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So, well, anyway,
taken from there,

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:34.580 align:middle line:84%
that's when he went on being
asked after he said, OK,

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:90%
we have other forms of TB.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Then, he started to
cure lung tuberculosis,

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.970 align:middle line:84%
including the wife of
Albert Schweitzer, who

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:44.800 align:middle line:90%
had lung tuberculosis.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Already in both fields, they
couldn't do anything with her.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.960 align:middle line:90%
She was 51.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, she came to my father.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.080 align:middle line:90%
She lived till 86.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Didn't he also work on
Albert Schweitzer himself later?

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, ' but he had diabetes.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And he worked
on their daughter.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.750 align:middle line:84%
She had a undiagnosable
skin disease.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And Schweitzer ended up
saying that your father was one

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.275 align:middle line:84%
of the great medical
geniuses in history.

00:14:11.275 --> 00:14:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's right.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Which it would certainly
appear, even to this day,

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:17.900 align:middle line:90%
holds water.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, OK, so Schweitzer
brought his wife.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:84%
We're looking into the '40s
now before he started--

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.360 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, not the '40s.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.385 align:middle line:84%
This is in the
mid-'20s, early '30s.

00:14:27.385 --> 00:14:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, but I'm saying,
by the '40, he was--

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.280 align:middle line:84%
he had done a number
of cancer studies.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>> By that time--

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:41.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, when Hitler came in 1933,
we had to leave Germany.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:84%
We lived in Austria two years,
in France a year and a half,

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:50.975 align:middle line:84%
in England for a few months, and
came to the US in late 1935--

00:14:50.975 --> 00:14:51.775 align:middle line:90%
Christmas.

00:14:51.775 --> 00:14:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK?

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's when, in '36,
is when he seriously studied

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.240 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And he found there
was a difference.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Later, he called the difference
between chronic disease

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:09.370 align:middle line:90%
and cancer--

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.510 align:middle line:84%
he said, in chronic disease,
the liver is weakened.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:13.660 align:middle line:90%
The liver is damaged.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.130 align:middle line:90%
The liver isn't functioning.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not doing its job.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.280 align:middle line:90%
In cancer, the liver is toxic.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.420 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't really
discover this thoroughly

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.480 align:middle line:90%
and learn how to detoxify.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that's one of
his greatest contributions--

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>> --to understand toxicity
and to find a way to detoxify

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:37.860 align:middle line:90%
the liver.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've had
an occasional patient

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:44.330 align:middle line:84%
where they tell us-- a
doctor said, you're toxic.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So the patient, logically, asks,
well, what can I do about it?

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And they always report, the
doctor just looks at you crazy.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:57.110 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't have any idea.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Or, if he knows, if he is at
all familiar with my father's

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:06.750 align:middle line:84%
work or some similar work
nowadays, there's more of it.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>> He wouldn't pass it along.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>> What happened after
he testified in Congress?

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.240 align:middle line:84%
We'll move into
the cancer studies.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.770 align:middle line:90%
This is, what, '45?

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.530 align:middle line:90%
'44 or '45?

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:20.330 align:middle line:90%
Around that.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:21.125 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not quite sure.

00:16:21.125 --> 00:16:21.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Mid-'40s.

00:16:21.925 --> 00:16:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>> '43-'44, I'm
not sure exactly.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:24.840 align:middle line:90%
It's in the biography.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.890 align:middle line:84%
What happened-- of
course, it should

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:35.440 align:middle line:84%
have been big news
in the newspaper,

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:84%
but the opposition had
taken care of that.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.250 align:middle line:84%
They had organized a big
reception for all the newspaper

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:47.760 align:middle line:84%
people, with girls, and
with drinks, and with food,

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and entertainment,
so that nobody

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:57.180 align:middle line:84%
went to interview
Dr. Gerson on this.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.760 align:middle line:90%
They all went to the fun place.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Diversionary, yes.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And like I said, the AMA, the
Journal of the American Medical

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Association, came
out in saying--

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.440 align:middle line:84%
in Dr. Carson's
testimony, fortunately

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:18.210 align:middle line:84%
for the American people
was not widely distributed.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.069 align:middle line:90%
>> That's beyond sad.

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:84%
At this point, he
had already affected

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.840 align:middle line:84%
the lives of, I assume,
thousands of people.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>> I wouldn't say thousands.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Hundreds?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Hundreds.

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:28.367 align:middle line:90%
>> Hundreds of people.

00:17:28.367 --> 00:17:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>> But eventually,
it's thousands.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And we have, again,
reached thousands more.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's interesting,
we don't even know how many.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Because my father's book
was translated into seven

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.060 align:middle line:90%
languages.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:46.200 align:middle line:84%
My present book, which has been
out now for a year and a half--

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.980 align:middle line:84%
by the way, the first printing,
10,000 copies, has sold out.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:52.200 align:middle line:84%
We are just doing
the second printing.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.550 align:middle line:84%
That one is already translated
into nine different languages.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.680 align:middle line:90%
So people pick up the book.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.370 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea how many
make it, how many recover.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.940 align:middle line:84%
But every so often, my
son, Howard Strauss,

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.420 align:middle line:84%
who lives in Carmel, who does
also a lot of work with this--

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.530 align:middle line:84%
he has traveled to Japan,
and to Kuala Lumpur,

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.480 align:middle line:90%
to Thailand, to Singapore.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.350 align:middle line:84%
He has done lectures
in Southeast Asia.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And people know of the work and
the languages, and they use it.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And every so often
somebody pipes up and says,

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.975 align:middle line:84%
well, I have such
and such cancer

00:18:27.975 --> 00:18:29.730 align:middle line:90%
or I had this and this disease.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And I use the book
and recovered.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.510 align:middle line:84%
We would never
even know about it.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:35.310 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.383 align:middle line:84%
You would have no
idea how many people

00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:42.120 align:middle line:84%
are using this in their home and
taking care of this themselves.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, at some point,
when he started seeing clients

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.270 align:middle line:84%
in the United States,
at some point,

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.845 align:middle line:84%
wasn't he restricted from
practicing in the United

00:18:50.845 --> 00:18:51.645 align:middle line:90%
States?

00:18:51.645 --> 00:18:52.020 align:middle line:90%
Did that happen?

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>> No, he wasn't.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.040 align:middle line:84%
They didn't get that
far during his lifetime.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:57.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.723 align:middle line:90%
>> Not doing his lifetime.

00:18:58.723 --> 00:19:00.057 align:middle line:90%
>> And what happened after that?

00:19:00.057 --> 00:19:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>> It's only later.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Because he died in
the late 1950s, right?

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:07.686 align:middle line:90%
>> He died on March 8, 1959.

00:19:07.686 --> 00:19:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.810 align:middle line:84%
It was after that when
Mexico developed [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and people started to do
understand that there are other

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:middle line:84%
ways than chemo or
poison, slash and burn--

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:29.130 align:middle line:84%
that they started to pass laws,
and it started in California.

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it was Reagan's
wife's father who was--

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.475 align:middle line:90%
>> He was an MD, yes, uh-huh.

00:19:38.475 --> 00:19:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>> --who managed to
pass these laws--

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:44.440 align:middle line:84%
first introduced them and
passed them first in California.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And then this spread
with the help of the AMA.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.900 align:middle line:84%
It spread all
through the country

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:84%
so that it started
in California.

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.880 align:middle line:90%
And it's not actually a law.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:03.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a health department
regulation that any physician

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:09.940 align:middle line:84%
or health-trained person who
treats or diagnosis cancer

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:84%
in any way except surgery
radiation and chemo is

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.270 align:middle line:90%
a felon--

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:21.940 align:middle line:84%
goes to jail, loses his
license, his livelihood,

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and pays a $10,000 fine, for
the crime of healing cancer.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>> You can't do that.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why you can find
so many clinics across

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:35.250 align:middle line:90%
the border--

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:35.940 align:middle line:90%
California.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.760 align:middle line:84%
You got into Tijuana,
you'll find all kinds

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.200 align:middle line:90%
of clinics in Tijuana.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>> In Tijuana, there's a whole
lot of different clinics.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And they have done
a really good job.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>> There are a lot of them
that work, that heal people.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:51.270 align:middle line:90%
Not completely.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.950 align:middle line:84%
The Gerson therapy still has
the longest and best record

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:59.840 align:middle line:84%
and most cancers that
patients recover and recover

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.740 align:middle line:90%
the longest.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's get into that now.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.295 align:middle line:90%
So we have a--

00:21:05.295 --> 00:21:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and thank you so much for
the background on your father

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:08.750 align:middle line:90%
in sharing that--

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
it-- from its roots.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:15.170 align:middle line:84%
So here we have
many, many people

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:21.980 align:middle line:84%
are coming to practitioners
of the Gerson techniques.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk
about what that is.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.390 align:middle line:84%
What happens when someone
comes to a facility

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.420 align:middle line:84%
now for rebalancing their
health and detoxification?

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>> You put it very succinctly,
but let me first elaborate

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.540 align:middle line:90%
a little bit to make sense.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, please.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, it is absolutely clear
that in a normal healthy

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.960 align:middle line:84%
functioning body,
cancer is impossible.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.050 align:middle line:84%
The body has very powerful
defenses against cancer,

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:56.370 align:middle line:84%
including the enzyme system,
the hormone system, the mineral

00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:00.420 align:middle line:84%
balances, the immune
system, circulation--

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.890 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of powerful defenses.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:08.310 align:middle line:84%
If only one works well,
you can't have cancer.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:middle line:84%
So first thing you have to
do is damage, weaken, poison,

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.590 align:middle line:84%
or, to a degree,
destroy your defenses.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.580 align:middle line:90%
And how do you do that?

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:90%
By poisoning them, largely--

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.010 align:middle line:84%
by getting the
wrong food, too much

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:84%
pesticide in food,
and chemicalized food,

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and too much animal
proteins, which are clearly

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.750 align:middle line:84%
demonstrated by T Colin
Campbell, who wrote a book

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:37.910 align:middle line:84%
called "The China
Study," where he clearly

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:45.110 align:middle line:84%
states that the number-one
carcinogen in the world

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:49.160 align:middle line:84%
is animal proteins, including
particularly milk-type

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:90%
proteins.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>> In the meantime, some
researchers in India have found

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.050 align:middle line:84%
they call milk,
"the white poison."

00:22:58.050 --> 00:22:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm, OK.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.360 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
you have to do

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:08.190 align:middle line:84%
is damage, poison, weaken,
or destroy the defenses.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that
difficult nowadays.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.400 align:middle line:90%
It's difficult not to do it.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>> True, just drink the local
water that's been chemicalized.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The chemicalized water,
the fluoridated water,

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.690 align:middle line:84%
the damaged soil, the damaged
earth, the damaged air,

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:22.740 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And once you have weakened
your body enough, that's when,

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:35.010 align:middle line:84%
either by wrong food,
or toxins, or whatever,

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:38.880 align:middle line:84%
that's when the body can
no longer maintain balance.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.870 align:middle line:90%
It tries very hard.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:42.060 align:middle line:84%
It can no longer
maintain balance.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.060 align:middle line:84%
That's when we are
told that all of us--

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:48.120 align:middle line:84%
at one point or another,
we develop some wild cells.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.670 align:middle line:84%
But the body steps in,
gets rid of it, no problem.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>> OK?

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>> It's designed
toward survival.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:54.880 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.320 align:middle line:84%
But if that doesn't
happen, now it's

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:05.010 align:middle line:84%
our job to restore
the body's defenses--

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:08.160 align:middle line:84%
to restore the immune
system, the enzyme system,

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.970 align:middle line:84%
the hormone balances, amino
imbalances-- everything.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And we don't work
with just one organ.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.470 align:middle line:90%
That's a mistake.

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:18.300 align:middle line:90%
The body is not one organ.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:22.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderfully
coordinated whole.

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:26.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautifully
organized whole

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:31.110 align:middle line:84%
that you have to deal
with every part of it.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.960 align:middle line:90%
OK, so what do we dd--

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:38.280 align:middle line:84%
the first thing, of course,
is to help to detoxify.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.170 align:middle line:90%
The body is toxic.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:43.050 align:middle line:84%
We have to detoxify
the body, but we also

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:47.040 align:middle line:84%
have to restore and
rebuild all the organ

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.010 align:middle line:90%
systems, all the organ systems.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:52.830 align:middle line:84%
We don't work on just the
liver, although the liver is

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.600 align:middle line:90%
the most important--

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:59.250 align:middle line:84%
the liver, the pancreas, the
thyroid, the lungs, the heart,

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:00.270 align:middle line:90%
and kidneys--

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:03.730 align:middle line:90%
everything has to be restored.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So it just happens to work best
with the fresh-living juices.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Nature puts these foods, these
items, on the earth for us.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.570 align:middle line:84%
They not only help
us maintain health,

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:21.600 align:middle line:90%
but they help us restore health.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.940 align:middle line:84%
The organ systems,
the organs that we

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:27.360 align:middle line:90%
have poisoned, and starved--

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.990 align:middle line:84%
you know, you can be
obese and starved.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the
obesity is calories.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not nutrients, which
are enzymes, minerals,

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.180 align:middle line:90%
and vitamins.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.580 align:middle line:90%
People don't understand.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:38.380 align:middle line:90%
That's nutrients!

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And the juices have
all of these things.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.035 align:middle line:84%
>> The juices have
them in a living form.

00:25:43.035 --> 00:25:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, the enzyme seems
to be the real key here.

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:47.790 align:middle line:90%
Massive amounts of enzymes.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>> The enzymes are exactly--

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.480 align:middle line:90%
they're very important things.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And they really only work
when they're live and fresh.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
work very well when

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.210 align:middle line:90%
they're in pharmaceutical form.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, exactly.

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, now, you know very
well that a lot of people are

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.610 align:middle line:84%
beginning to be aware, that
they need to supplement

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:12.840 align:middle line:90%
their nutrition.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so poor, the
McDonald's and so on--

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, and even if you
go to a supermarket

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and buy from the produce
aisle, a lot of this

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.290 align:middle line:84%
has been irradiated if it's
been imported and subjected

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:26.910 align:middle line:84%
to massive amounts
of chemicals--

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:27.990 align:middle line:90%
herbicides, pesticides.

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:30.180 align:middle line:90%
So it's devoid of nutrition.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>> In the supermarket, unless
you buy some organic food--

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:35.390 align:middle line:84%
some supermarkets now
have a certain amount--

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:39.720 align:middle line:84%
a few organic things, has
been chemically treated,

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and irradiated and
otherwise damaged.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.140 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the body is damaged,
is weakened, is poisoned.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:51.070 align:middle line:84%
You have to detoxify,
and restore, and rebuild.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:52.750 align:middle line:90%
But the juices do that.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Now if you talk to some
plumbers who clean septic tanks,

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.250 align:middle line:84%
they'll tell you that they find
hundreds, sometimes thousands

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:05.940 align:middle line:84%
of vitamin pills in there,
sometimes to the extent

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:10.947 align:middle line:84%
that you can still read the
logo from the manufacturer.

00:27:10.947 --> 00:27:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Descriptive, thank you.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:14.905 align:middle line:84%
>> It's wonderful to take
pills, but that doesn't prove

00:27:14.905 --> 00:27:15.705 align:middle line:90%
anything.

00:27:15.705 --> 00:27:16.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:16.505 --> 00:27:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It doesn't prove that
those nutrients do penetrate

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:25.680 align:middle line:84%
the tissues, go into the body,
and start to work on restoring

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:30.120 align:middle line:84%
the healthy cell systems and
the healthy organ systems--

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.733 align:middle line:84%
that will protect you and
heal the disease, whatever

00:27:33.733 --> 00:27:34.650 align:middle line:90%
you're suffering from.

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's say we're starting,
then, with, we need fresh,

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:39.060 align:middle line:90%
whole, organic fruits.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And so your program, there's
a lot of juice involved.

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:44.970 align:middle line:84%
If someone's going
through it properly,

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:47.310 align:middle line:84%
they're taking in a
glass of juice an hour

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and just flooding the
body with these minerals

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:51.045 align:middle line:90%
and with these enzymes.

00:27:51.045 --> 00:27:52.337 align:middle line:90%
>> A glass of juice every hour.

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Every hour.

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And one of the big
ones is a combination

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:57.300 align:middle line:90%
of carrot and apple, right?

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go into this--

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.420 align:middle line:90%
one every hour.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.570 align:middle line:90%


00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.900 align:middle line:84%
When a patient is
capable of taking 13--

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:12.090 align:middle line:84%
one every hour, 13 hours, is
capable of taking 13 glasses,

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:15.690 align:middle line:84%
some people are so terribly ill,
they can't even handle that.

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:21.130 align:middle line:84%
But many even seriously
ill ones can handle juice.

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So they take 13 juices,
they get three full meals--

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.990 align:middle line:90%
vegetarian.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And they get an extra
fruit plate in their room.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Total consumption
per day per patient--

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.010 align:middle line:90%
20 pounds of fresh living food.

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:38.650 align:middle line:90%
20 pounds.

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Now neither you nor any
other healthy person

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.800 align:middle line:84%
have ever eaten 20
pounds worth of food.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.895 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd say that's
definitely true.

00:28:45.895 --> 00:28:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Also, getting those foods
in the living, fresh, organic,

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:58.540 align:middle line:84%
free-of-poision form, they
really penetrate the tissues.

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.370 align:middle line:90%
They go into the cells.

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.830 align:middle line:84%
But the cells are
full of toxins.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Those get pushed out,
because the body's affinity

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.950 align:middle line:84%
is for the living, fresh,
organic living enzymes.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:13.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>> When those poisons are
pushed out of the tissues,

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.990 align:middle line:84%
not only is the
liver already toxic,

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:26.500 align:middle line:84%
but those poisons go
into the bloodstream.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And did you know that the
blood stream, all of your blood

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.950 align:middle line:84%
goes through the liver
once every three minutes?

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I didn't know
it was three minutes.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:34.500 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And it picks up, among other
things-- have many functions--

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.600 align:middle line:90%
but it picks up any poisons.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.260 align:middle line:84%
But if the liver is loaded
with poisons already,

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.270 align:middle line:90%
it can't even do that.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:50.110 align:middle line:84%
So it is extremely
important to detoxify

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:52.660 align:middle line:90%
or you can't get at the problem.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.710 align:middle line:90%
You can't get nutrients in.

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So part of this also is a
combination of using enemas

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:02.250 align:middle line:84%
in combination
with the nutrients.

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>> That's where
the enemas come in.

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yeah.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's where my
father accidentally

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:08.470 align:middle line:90%
found out about that.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:11.980 align:middle line:84%
This is nothing
that he invented.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Did you know the
[INAUDIBLE] gospel of peace,

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:17.830 align:middle line:84%
the Dead Sea Scrolls
that were translated,

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.935 align:middle line:84%
where Jesus talks about
how to take an enema?

00:30:20.935 --> 00:30:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Apparently, there was a
lot of information on health,

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:26.250 align:middle line:84%
sustenance, and
maintenance of health.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>> My father didn't
invent enemas.

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:31.450 align:middle line:90%


00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:39.480 align:middle line:84%
In the time of Louis the 14th,
Moliére, the big French writer.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.370 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a play called
"Le malade imaginaire",

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:44.170 align:middle line:90%
"The Imaginary Patient."

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:47.640 align:middle line:90%
He takes an enema on stage.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.245 align:middle line:84%
OK, now this is in the
16th century, 17th century.

00:30:50.245 --> 00:30:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So we shouldn't be so
uptight about the notion?

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:54.430 align:middle line:90%
The fact is, it comes in--

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and we are-- in the United
States in particular,

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.590 align:middle line:90%
there's a real phobia.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:59.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's include England.

00:30:59.632 --> 00:31:00.717 align:middle line:90%
>> And England, yes.

00:31:00.717 --> 00:31:01.800 align:middle line:90%
There's a phobia about it.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Interestingly, other
countries in Europe--

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:08.200 align:middle line:84%
for instance, I had a very
good friend, a lady from Iran,

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.070 align:middle line:90%
they use enemas.

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:13.150 align:middle line:84%
They don't use coffee as much
as tea, because tea also-- tea

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:15.080 align:middle line:90%
is very similar to caffeine.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.205 align:middle line:84%
>> And same in India
and many countries.

00:31:17.205 --> 00:31:18.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Many countries.

00:31:18.095 --> 00:31:18.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:18.895 --> 00:31:20.617 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just--

00:31:20.617 --> 00:31:21.450 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:23.290 align:middle line:84%
>> You need to just
flush out the bowel.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:23.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:23.555 --> 00:31:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Get it cleansed out.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>> But it isn't the bowel.

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:27.145 align:middle line:90%
>> The colon?

00:31:27.145 --> 00:31:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.795 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, my father
found it's the liver.

00:31:31.795 --> 00:31:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, interesting.

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:34.220 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the liver.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:38.410 align:middle line:84%
The liver has to be opened
to clear those toxins that it

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:41.580 align:middle line:90%
keeps picking up.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's all very nice
to talk about the bowels,

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:45.580 align:middle line:90%
but laxatives don't work.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:48.190 align:middle line:90%
They don't reach the liver.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, he found that-- and this
was in a roundabout way due

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:55.810 align:middle line:84%
to World War I-- this
is a long story--

00:31:55.810 --> 00:32:00.070 align:middle line:84%
but he found out that
caffeine rectally

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:04.690 align:middle line:84%
is absorbed through
the hemorrhoidal vein

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:07.660 align:middle line:84%
into the portal
system, into the liver.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And at the point of the liver--
and that was testified--

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:16.690 align:middle line:84%
it was definitely
described by two professors

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:21.490 align:middle line:84%
in a university in Germany,
in Gottingen in Germany.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:25.450 align:middle line:84%
They found it in animals,
but it worked in humans--

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:29.500 align:middle line:84%
that the caffeine, rectally--
it doesn't work by drinking--

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.230 align:middle line:84%
caffeine rectally
opens the bile duct

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:35.905 align:middle line:90%
so the liver is able to let go.

00:32:35.905 --> 00:32:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I always wondered why--

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.470 align:middle line:84%
what his science behind
that was, very interesting.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but it doesn't
work with coffee by mouth.

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>> On the contrary,
that was tested--

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:47.988 align:middle line:84%
>> On the contrary, yes,
it toxifies the liver.

00:32:47.988 --> 00:32:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>> --and it spasms--

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:52.180 align:middle line:84%
those same things
that open up, that you

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:57.580 align:middle line:84%
need to open up the bile
ducts for the bile to let go.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Now this all said, this
has to be managed properly.

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:04.270 align:middle line:84%
If a person is watching
this and is quite ill,

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:06.700 align:middle line:84%
they really need
to contact someone

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.395 align:middle line:90%
who knows how to manage this.

00:33:08.395 --> 00:33:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and of course, the
book shows what happens when

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.410 align:middle line:84%
you're very ill, what happened
when you've had chemo,

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:17.050 align:middle line:84%
what happens if you haven't
had chemo, and so on.

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:21.310 align:middle line:84%
But you see, to prove that
we're not specifically

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:25.240 align:middle line:84%
working on cleansing the
colon, like the bowel movement,

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.786 align:middle line:90%
we do five enemas a day.

00:33:28.786 --> 00:33:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And does this cause
any kind of reaction?

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:36.160 align:middle line:84%
The bile duct to open
and pain disappears.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The patients who come
on very heavy painkillers,

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.200 align:middle line:90%
on morphine--

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.490 align:middle line:90%
and that's not even enough.

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:48.700 align:middle line:84%
They have to take other
painkillers-- codeine

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.390 align:middle line:90%
and others besides.

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:53.330 align:middle line:90%
In a week, the pain is gone.

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes if they're not on too
heavy painkillers, in two days,

00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:59.360 align:middle line:90%
the pain is gone.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.700 align:middle line:84%
We've had patients who
testified-- one day,

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:05.132 align:middle line:84%
I took three doctors around
the rounds in Mexico.

00:34:05.132 --> 00:34:07.640 align:middle line:84%
3 out of that 10
patients testified

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:11.995 align:middle line:84%
that with their first coffee
enema, their pain disappeared.

00:34:11.995 --> 00:34:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>> But a laxative
alone won't do that.

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:19.589 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, and I understand why.

00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:20.389 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>> But you have to
open the bile duct.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And the coffee
enemas do that.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So when a person comes to
one of the Gerson practitioners,

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.953 align:middle line:84%
how long does a program
like this generally take?

00:34:37.953 --> 00:34:38.870 align:middle line:90%
How long do they stay?

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:39.870 align:middle line:90%
Because this is pretty--

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:41.750 align:middle line:84%
20 pounds of food
and a glass of juice

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:45.290 align:middle line:84%
an hour, you have to really
stay on top of this, obviously.

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:48.300 align:middle line:84%
This is not a casual
commitment, OK.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>> The how-long questions
are the most difficult ones

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:51.620 align:middle line:90%
to answer.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's very
different, isn't it?

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:58.699 align:middle line:84%
>> However, we have to get
back to the original premise,

00:34:58.699 --> 00:35:02.540 align:middle line:84%
namely that the liver is
damaged, the liver is weakened,

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:03.650 align:middle line:90%
the liver is toxic.

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:08.390 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able to restore
the liver, and it takes time.

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:10.266 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:10.266 --> 00:35:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>> My father found, in his
day, it took a year and a half.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:17.660 align:middle line:84%
We found it's not
enough anymore.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.158 align:middle line:90%
>> Because we're more toxic now.

00:35:19.158 --> 00:35:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>> People are much more toxic--

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>> --the soil, the earth,
the air, the water.

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Everything is more toxic
than it was 50 years ago.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.090 align:middle line:90%
It takes two years.

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Two years.

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And now to what
degree of commitment,

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.160 align:middle line:90%
this full-on commitment--

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, it's still at least 10
glasses of juice and at least

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:42.200 align:middle line:84%
one or two enemas a
day for two years.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.230 align:middle line:84%
They come down, not
from five, to one--

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:48.890 align:middle line:84%
from five maybe to four
if the liver is now

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:51.710 align:middle line:84%
capable of flushing
out the poisons.

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:56.210 align:middle line:84%
But that's easy to tell because,
if it isn't, you get headaches,

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and you get a little nausea,
and you don't feel good,

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.650 align:middle line:84%
maybe you have a little pain,
you take an enema, boom, pain

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:03.450 align:middle line:90%
is gone.

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you didn't get enough
enemas, your body tells you.

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's when you start
getting those side effects,

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:12.918 align:middle line:90%
of feeling headachy?

00:36:12.918 --> 00:36:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>> That's something else again.

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:15.530 align:middle line:90%
That's something else again.

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:17.706 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:36:17.706 --> 00:36:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about what
it feels like in a body

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:22.820 align:middle line:84%
that's ill, maybe has
even been through chemo,

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.840 align:middle line:84%
or has cancer that is
advanced enough that--

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's first talk about
non-chemo-treated patients,

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.480 align:middle line:84%
because they respond
much better, of course.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.903 align:middle line:84%
They're not additionally
poisoned by the doctors.

00:36:33.903 --> 00:36:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, let's do that.

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, you can tell by the
way I pronounce the word,

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.675 align:middle line:90%
my son always tries me on that--

00:36:41.675 --> 00:36:44.300 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not particularly
impressed by what

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.390 align:middle line:90%
doctors do for people.

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] I can tell.

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] It's evident.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.455 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into what
is a traditional--

00:36:51.455 --> 00:36:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So the traditional patients
gets 13 glasses of juice,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.110 align:middle line:90%
five enemas a day.

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:03.140 align:middle line:84%
His pain disappears, so he can
eat and drink the right food.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:07.220 align:middle line:84%
If he were to stop and eat, say,
a hamburger or a hot dog god

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:12.140 align:middle line:84%
forbid, it would
immediately recur.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.700 align:middle line:84%
He would immediately have
pain, nausea, headache,

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:15.530 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:17.490 align:middle line:90%
The body tells you.

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So with that kind of therapy,
it takes two years to fully

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:28.940 align:middle line:84%
restore all the organ's
systems, all the defenses,

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.500 align:middle line:90%
all of the body that's damaged.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.540 align:middle line:84%
When we are dealing
with chemo patients,

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.220 align:middle line:90%
now that's very interesting.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:41.540 align:middle line:84%
We can't give them
as heavy detoxifying,

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:45.230 align:middle line:84%
because if they detoxify
too fast, a lot of the chemo

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:46.370 align:middle line:90%
is released at once.

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>> And it has happened before.

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:50.630 align:middle line:84%
We knew my father--
it wasn't in the book.

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>> He didn't talk about chemo.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.390 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't know.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:38:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So when we first started to
even admit chemo patients,

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:03.650 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't admit them for a
while before we admitted them.

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:06.560 align:middle line:84%
When we admitted them
and we started them

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:10.580 align:middle line:84%
on the full detoxifying, which
is five coffee enemas a day,

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:14.990 align:middle line:84%
13 glasses of juice, and, every
other day, castor oil by mouth

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:16.580 align:middle line:90%
an enema.

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.740 align:middle line:84%
When we did that
with a chemo patient,

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:21.320 align:middle line:90%
they got very seriously ill.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.370 align:middle line:90%
We almost lost them.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:23.840 align:middle line:90%
They went into intensive care.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.460 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.500 align:middle line:84%
The body released all
the chemo at once.

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Now please remember, this
is an arithmetic situation.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:37.790 align:middle line:84%
When the doctors give chemo--
and it tells you that in all

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:41.570 align:middle line:84%
of the material that comes
wit the chemo drugs--

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:47.480 align:middle line:84%
the body will excrete much
of it in the first 48 hours.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Much of it is usually around
50%, 45% to 50%, which means,

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:57.880 align:middle line:84%
if you have had
10 shots of chemo,

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.840 align:middle line:84%
five or more still
in your system,

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:04.400 align:middle line:84%
even a year or two after
that, they're still there

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:08.090 align:middle line:84%
in your system, but it
cannot get rid of them.

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:12.680 align:middle line:84%
If we now do very
intensive detoxifying,

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.180 align:middle line:90%
they're all released at once.

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So you'll get five chemo
shots in one treatment.

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:19.490 align:middle line:90%
You'll get a terrible overdose.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.527 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, absolutely,
yes, I see this.

00:39:21.527 --> 00:39:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like we are
giving them an overdose.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.070 align:middle line:90%
We don't touch this stuff.

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:28.130 align:middle line:84%
But we have to be
extremely careful

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and not forcing the body
to release it too fast.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So chemo pre-treated patients
have to be treated differently.

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:40.160 align:middle line:84%
They don't get five enemas
a day, they get three.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.580 align:middle line:84%
They get no castor
oil for six months

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:48.660 align:middle line:84%
until the body is able to get
rid of much of the accumulated

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:49.460 align:middle line:90%
chemo.

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Then, we very cautiously
give them a little tiny bit

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:58.220 align:middle line:84%
of castor oil, only rectally in
the enema, until we are feeling

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:03.290 align:middle line:84%
fairly sure that with a little
more castor oil and release

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:10.666 align:middle line:84%
of those still-remaining chemo,
we won't overchemo them, OK.

00:40:10.666 --> 00:40:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so I think we
have a fairly good idea.

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And people, again,
they can read the book,

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.450 align:middle line:84%
and they can contact
the institute-

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very carefully
outlined in the book.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.933 align:middle line:84%
And it's not in my
father's book because he

00:40:23.933 --> 00:40:25.100 align:middle line:90%
didn't have to deal with it.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:28.760 align:middle line:90%
OK, so in your book--

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and that's on the
website, and we're

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.130 align:middle line:84%
going to make that
available to everybody.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it's on the website.

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:36.450 align:middle line:90%
And you can buy it with Amazon.

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you can buy it at
the Gerson Institute and Amazon

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.420 align:middle line:90%
Totality Books, it's available.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And this one is
"Healing the Gerson Way?"

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>> "Healing the Gerson Way."

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's by you, Charlotte.

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, and it's updated.

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:48.477 align:middle line:90%
It has the latest.

00:40:48.477 --> 00:40:50.810 align:middle line:84%
There's another book, it's
called "The Gershon Therapy,"

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:54.700 align:middle line:84%
but that's already six,
seven, eight years old,

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.545 align:middle line:84%
and it's not as good,
it's not as complete.

00:40:57.545 --> 00:40:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, now let's look at--

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And let me just please add,
I have a co-author on that,

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:04.820 align:middle line:90%
Beata Bishop.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.410 align:middle line:90%
She's a wonderful writer.

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:08.690 align:middle line:90%
She is a marvelous editor.

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:13.610 align:middle line:84%
But she's also a 28-year
recovered melanoma patient.

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:17.180 align:middle line:84%
She had stage IV
melanoma 28 years ago.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:22.290 align:middle line:84%
She was given two to six months
on the outside 28 years ago.

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:23.240 align:middle line:90%
She's very much alive.

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.510 align:middle line:84%
She just started a
Gerson Clinic in Hungary.

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:28.040 align:middle line:90%
And she helped me with my book.

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>> How fabulous, you
were able to link up.

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's say a person watching this
is feeling pretty good, maybe

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:36.920 align:middle line:84%
young and feeling pretty
healthy, maybe not optimal,

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and wants to start incorporating
some of these practices

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:40.820 align:middle line:90%
into their daily life.

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Why not?

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Why not?

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Why not?

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>> But one thing you talk about
in the book I found interesting

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:48.850 align:middle line:84%
is about the type
of juicer one uses.

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Because you can find
all kinds of juicers.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.820 align:middle line:84%
You can find them at every
major discount warehouse

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:55.640 align:middle line:90%
store for $50 to $90.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.770 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying
those centrifugal,

00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:00.230 align:middle line:84%
convenient little
juices actually

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:03.750 align:middle line:84%
are only extracting a small
percentage of the nutrients.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>> A very small percentage.

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>> But you told me,
I think, 7% to 15%--

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Up to about 7% of
the available nutrients.

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Of the available nutrients,

00:42:13.232 --> 00:42:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, nevertheless,
especially for children,

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:23.160 align:middle line:84%
if they drink that juice
rather than the sweet sodas--

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>> It's vastly preferable--

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:29.582 align:middle line:90%
OK, much, much better.

00:42:29.582 --> 00:42:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And then what happens
when you go to the next one,

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:32.730 align:middle line:90%
the Champion Juicer?

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The Champion Juicer
will extract 12% to 15%.

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:41.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's good.

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Even patients, it'll help
them recover, but not cancer

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:46.490 align:middle line:90%
patients, not good enough.

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Not for cancer.

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:49.310 align:middle line:84%
OK, but for a
healthy person that

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:52.730 align:middle line:84%
wants to just really boost their
nutrient levels, it's still OK?

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:56.015 align:middle line:84%
But you say there's another type
that is much more effective--

00:42:56.015 --> 00:42:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>> It's much more effective.

00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:00.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's not the only type.

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:04.020 align:middle line:84%
The one that we feel
is absolutely the best,

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.710 align:middle line:84%
the top of the line,
it's called the Norwalk.

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:08.677 align:middle line:84%
And that one has an
interesting history,

00:43:08.677 --> 00:43:10.010 align:middle line:90%
if you have another few minutes.

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:11.642 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:43:11.642 --> 00:43:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Norwalk was put together
by a gentleman with the name

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:17.300 align:middle line:90%
of "Norman Walker."

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:22.050 align:middle line:90%
Norman Walker was ill.

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And nobody could determine
what was wrong with him.

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:25.480 align:middle line:90%
He felt terrible.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.280 align:middle line:90%
He was weak.

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.080 align:middle line:90%
He was weary.

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.770 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't functioning.

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:30.820 align:middle line:90%
He was 38, 39 years old.

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.903 align:middle line:90%
They sent him home to die.

00:43:32.903 --> 00:43:34.570 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
they could do for him.

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:37.900 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't figure out
what was wrong with him.

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And he thought, OK, well,
I'll have to find my own way.

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:43.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he did.

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And he decided he wanted
fresh living fruits,

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:47.980 align:middle line:90%
and he couldn't even eat.

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:49.600 align:middle line:90%
He wanted juices.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.850 align:middle line:90%
So he designed a juicer.

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's now-- it's
continued to be improved.

00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:02.860 align:middle line:84%
But the juicer is the kind my
father also found was the best.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.320 align:middle line:90%
You grind the material first.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And, interestingly,
the ground-up apples

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:09.560 align:middle line:90%
and the ground-up carrots--

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:12.790 align:middle line:84%
the acid of the apples
help the mushed carrots

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:15.940 align:middle line:84%
to release a lot
of the minerals.

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Then, you put it in the
cloth under pressure.

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And that will extract up to 50%,
55%, up to 55% of the minerals.

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.440 align:middle line:84%
You can't ever
extract all of them.

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, now, so let's say
a person is going to go

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.830 align:middle line:84%
to a varying degree on
their commitment to juicing.

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:38.440 align:middle line:84%
What about the notion of
just eating the fresh apples

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:41.140 align:middle line:84%
and eating the fresh
carrots, other than you

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:42.405 align:middle line:90%
can't take that many in.

00:44:42.405 --> 00:44:42.565 align:middle line:90%
>> That's wonderful.

00:44:42.565 --> 00:44:42.680 align:middle line:90%
How many can you eat?

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:42.880 align:middle line:90%
That's the trouble.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.940 align:middle line:84%
But still, you can get
100% of the nutrients

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.050 align:middle line:90%
from them with fewer, right?

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Yes, how many carrots and
apples can you eat a day?

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, not that many.

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Not that many.

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Even if you
eat three or four?

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Five apples.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.440 align:middle line:84%
That would make
roughly one and a half,

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.290 align:middle line:90%
barely two glasses of juice.

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:02.090 align:middle line:90%
We give 13.

00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not enough.

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:07.650 align:middle line:84%
You really need the
saturation of the nutrients.

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The cancer will get
ahead of you in a hurry.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.625 align:middle line:84%
We have to get
ahead of the cancer.

00:45:12.625 --> 00:45:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And, according to
the news media and all

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.450 align:middle line:84%
the advertisements,
I see on TV, geez,

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.880 align:middle line:84%
it would seem that they're
on top of it out there

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.560 align:middle line:84%
in the medical
industrial complex.

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.810 align:middle line:84%
I see pink ribbons
on the back of cars

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and in all the
ladies journals, page

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.580 align:middle line:84%
after page of these
advertisements-- really

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:31.480 align:middle line:90%
upsetting to me.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It's becoming
almost a status thing,

00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:39.410 align:middle line:84%
a status symbol to sport your
pink ribbon for breast cancer.

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:41.860 align:middle line:84%
There's something
terribly wrong with this

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:45.310 align:middle line:84%
when they're deliberately
suppressing the very things

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:46.300 align:middle line:90%
that can help heal it.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let me give you a
little bit of a documented

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:50.620 align:middle line:90%
background.

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:53.210 align:middle line:84%
You may recall-- although
you're very young--

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:58.930 align:middle line:84%
you may recall that 1972,
our then President Nixon

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:00.290 align:middle line:90%
declared the war on cancer.

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:01.090 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:09.770 align:middle line:84%
[COUGHS] And he said, if we push
enough money at this problem,

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:10.570 align:middle line:90%
we'll solve it.

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:13.150 align:middle line:90%


00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And that year, 1972, numbers,
figures, 220,000 Americans

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:24.370 align:middle line:90%
died of various cancers.

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Exactly 25 years
later, Newsweek and I

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:33.145 align:middle line:84%
believe it was also a USA
Today published the new data.

00:46:33.145 --> 00:46:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>> This would have been
around '97, late '90s.

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly 25 years, in '97.

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:45.430 align:middle line:84%
The new data was that that
year 560,000 Americans

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:46.900 align:middle line:90%
died of cancer.

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And pancreatic
cancer had jumped.

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.950 align:middle line:90%
Breast cancer had jumped.

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Lung cancer had jumped--

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:58.400 align:middle line:84%
39 billion research
dollars later, OK.

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:01.660 align:middle line:84%
All of this research
money goes for what?

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:03.766 align:middle line:84%
Something that makes
money-- chemotherapy.

00:47:03.766 --> 00:47:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Lots of money.

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Lots of money went
into chemotherapy.

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And all the money people donate
for supposed breast cancer

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:15.880 align:middle line:84%
research goes into more chemo,
more poison, more misery,

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:19.090 align:middle line:84%
when people get this, and
feel terrible, and die

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:21.010 align:middle line:90%
in a horrible death.

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:22.990 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're paying for.

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:26.470 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the people-- some
of the top people of American

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:27.850 align:middle line:90%
Cancer Society--

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:30.970 align:middle line:84%
they get "million
dollars a year" salaries.

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:33.100 align:middle line:84%
That's the research
you pay for when

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.110 align:middle line:90%
you buy these pink ribbons.

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and you told me off
camera before we got going

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:39.850 align:middle line:90%
a stat.

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:44.950 align:middle line:84%
You were likening this
radiation and chemo holocaust

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:48.240 align:middle line:84%
to the original-- the World
War II Holocaust in numbers.

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's
the trouble, too.

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:53.560 align:middle line:84%
You see, when my father
had a demonstration

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:58.630 align:middle line:84%
of his cured patients before
a congressional committee in--

00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:03.550 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was '43, I'm
not sure of the date--

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:06.910 align:middle line:84%
he showed five-- he
actually had 10 with them--

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:10.720 align:middle line:84%
but he showed five cured
patients that he had treated

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.340 align:middle line:90%
with the Gerson therapy--

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:14.650 align:middle line:90%
that had been sent home to die.

00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And he was the first person
ever to show recovered patients

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:20.510 align:middle line:90%
before Congress.

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it also went
into the congressional record.

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:28.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, at that time,
of course you would

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:31.450 align:middle line:84%
think that this sort of
thing went right and all

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:32.470 align:middle line:90%
over the newspapers.

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:35.980 align:middle line:84%
But, no, the opposition,
they had organized--

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>> That social event.

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>> --newspaper special and a
party with women, and song,

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.668 align:middle line:90%
and with liquor.

00:48:44.668 --> 00:48:45.835 align:middle line:90%
>> So the story disappeared?

00:48:45.835 --> 00:48:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So the story disappeared,
except the AMA said,

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:54.130 align:middle line:84%
fortunately for the
American people,

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:56.050 align:middle line:90%
this got very little publicity.

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:57.610 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:02.710 align:middle line:84%
However, in the meantime,
since, let's say '44,

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:05.080 align:middle line:90%
we are now in 2009.

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:06.910 align:middle line:90%
That's, what, 55 years later?

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>> My arithmetic is correct?

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
we have not 560,000.

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:18.205 align:middle line:84%
We have over 600,000,
700,000 people--

00:49:18.205 --> 00:49:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, 65 years
later, isn't it?

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:22.270 align:middle line:90%
'45,

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:23.120 align:middle line:90%
>> '45, '50.

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, 65, yeah.

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Worldwide, OK, and since they
suppressed this information

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:36.930 align:middle line:84%
in all of those years, the
pharmaceutical companies,

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and AMA, and the doctors that
are making huge sums of money

00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:45.510 align:middle line:84%
on cancer, have killed more
people than Hitler and Stalin

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:46.455 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:49:46.455 --> 00:49:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Hm, yeah.

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:51.280 align:middle line:90%
It is a medical holocaust.

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.910 align:middle line:90%
There is no question about it.

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And they make huge
sums of money,

00:49:56.690 --> 00:50:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and they pump you full of
chemo, maybe temporarily,

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:03.620 align:middle line:84%
even the chemo, yes,
poisons the tumor tissue

00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:06.770 align:middle line:84%
until it also poisons the
rest of your body and you die.

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:09.490 align:middle line:90%


00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:12.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a terrible, terrible thing.

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:14.590 align:middle line:84%
But that's where
the big money is.

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:16.350 align:middle line:90%
There is not just billions.

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:17.150 align:middle line:90%
There's trillions.

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in 1996 when Ralph
Morris published his book,

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:28.420 align:middle line:84%
"The Cancer Industry," and
that's, now, 13 years ago.

00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:33.070 align:middle line:84%
He showed that, at that time,
the cancer industry in the US

00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:39.317 align:middle line:84%
alone was worth
$100 billion a year.

00:50:39.317 --> 00:50:40.962 align:middle line:90%
A year.

00:50:40.962 --> 00:50:42.670 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't cover
the rest of the world.

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>> That says a lot about
why you're not going to have

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:49.660 align:middle line:84%
your doctor recommend that
they go to your website,

00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:51.490 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:53.472 align:middle line:84%
Like you said earlier,
you can't make money off

00:50:53.472 --> 00:50:54.305 align:middle line:90%
of a bag of carrots.

00:50:54.305 --> 00:50:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>> You can't make money
on a bag of carrots.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>> But you know something very
interesting also happened.

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:04.270 align:middle line:84%
There is a researcher
who has done

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:08.080 align:middle line:84%
research on food and
nutrition because they also

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:08.890 align:middle line:90%
killed his father.

00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:11.560 align:middle line:84%
His father used to collect from
the American Cancer Society.

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:15.000 align:middle line:84%
When he had cancer, they
didn't want to know of him.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.350 align:middle line:90%
They threw him out.

00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:19.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, but Gary Null,
who is nutritionist--

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Gary Null, yes.

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, you know of him?

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>> He put him back together,
and he was doing very well,

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:28.000 align:middle line:84%
until one day Gary Null was
traveling in Europe for his

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.170 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And they got after the
father and said, you know,

00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:34.900 align:middle line:84%
we should really be able
to help you and finish up

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:38.770 align:middle line:84%
all of those stories and
really fix you up properly.

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:42.880 align:middle line:84%
They did bring him in, and they
talked him into taking chemo.

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:43.690 align:middle line:90%
They murdered him.

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Gary Null, of course, was
not very well to speak about all

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:49.980 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:52.130 align:middle line:90%
He did not like them.

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:54.890 align:middle line:84%
So he, at one point,
was doing research

00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:57.410 align:middle line:84%
on alternative and
nutritional therapy.

00:51:57.410 --> 00:52:00.530 align:middle line:84%
He also wanted to research
my father's testimony

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:02.030 align:middle line:90%
before Congress.

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Do you know it has been removed
from the congressional record?

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>> What does it take to remove
a portion of the congressional

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:12.590 align:middle line:90%
record?

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Some clout.

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Some clout.

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:20.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, I know you have
your birthday party.

00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:23.000 align:middle line:84%
People who are probably
arriving as we're speaking.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So just to kind of
wrap it up, a person

00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:32.310 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have to any longer
nervously pack their little bag

00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:36.720 align:middle line:84%
and, in a frightened way, go
across the border into Tijuana

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.000 align:middle line:84%
to find the kind of
help they need anymore.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.710 align:middle line:84%
There actually is
help, but it really

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:42.870 align:middle line:84%
requires a lot of
self involvement.

00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:45.060 align:middle line:84%
You have to take a lot of
responsibility yourself.

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to take
responsibility.

00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, it
also takes some money.

00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>> If you do need to go to the
clinic, you can do it at home.

00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:56.520 align:middle line:84%
It is very difficult because
of healing reactions,

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.180 align:middle line:90%
and their sponsors, and so on.

00:52:58.180 --> 00:52:59.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:02.860 align:middle line:84%
But to go across the border,
of course, you have to pay.

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:04.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's another thing.

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:09.210 align:middle line:84%
The AMA has sent out
one of their people

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:13.320 align:middle line:84%
who happens to be a doctor
and a lawyer, a lady, who

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:15.330 align:middle line:84%
went around all the
insurance companies

00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:17.880 align:middle line:84%
and made sure that the
insurance companies,

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:19.860 align:middle line:84%
when they write
medical insurance,

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:22.200 align:middle line:84%
they say it doesn't
cover abroad.

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.530 align:middle line:90%
So they don't pay--

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>> They won't pay.

00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>> --in Mexico.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.330 align:middle line:90%
So it does require some money.

00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And, unfortunately,
also, Medicare and so on

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:34.380 align:middle line:84%
doesn't pay for a juicer and it
doesn't pay for organic food.

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:37.320 align:middle line:84%
It does take a
little extra money.

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:42.750 align:middle line:84%
It does cost more to make
13 glasses of juice a day.

00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:43.620 align:middle line:90%
It does cost more.

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Even though you don't
go into a restaurant,

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.615 align:middle line:84%
and you don't buy
steaks, and you

00:53:46.615 --> 00:53:49.710 align:middle line:84%
don't buy lobster, and all
of the expensive cheeses

00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:53.460 align:middle line:84%
and so on, but it does
cost a little more.

00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:55.170 align:middle line:90%
So it does take a little money.

00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>> It takes a little money.

00:53:56.410 --> 00:53:56.930 align:middle line:90%
It takes some time.

00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:59.097 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what the
orthodox people are beginning

00:53:59.097 --> 00:54:02.160 align:middle line:84%
to understand, that they
get the poor people.

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.190 align:middle line:84%
People who have a little
money, they buy the DVDs,

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:07.680 align:middle line:84%
they buy the books, they
buy the information,

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.090 align:middle line:90%
they buy the juicers.

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:10.238 align:middle line:90%
They help themselves.

00:54:10.238 --> 00:54:11.780 align:middle line:84%
They don't always
tell their doctors.

00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, all I can say
is I'm sure you're

00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:20.100 align:middle line:84%
going to be hopping many, many
years into the future on this

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:23.010 align:middle line:84%
and just continuing
to take this forward.

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for a lifetime
of incredible work, you

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:28.010 align:middle line:90%
and your father.

00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd like to add a little
something about myself.

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I am really well.

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.480 align:middle line:90%
I have no hormones.

00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.590 align:middle line:90%
I take no drugs.

00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:44.130 align:middle line:84%
I take no chemicals, and
poisons, and drugs, and so on.

00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:45.970 align:middle line:90%
And you see my skin is clear.

00:54:45.970 --> 00:54:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I was looking at it.

00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>> And the other thing is this.

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Then they say, OK, you were
born with a good constitution.

00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:54.090 align:middle line:90%
Not so.

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:55.840 align:middle line:84%
By the time I was
eight years old,

00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:57.780 align:middle line:84%
I already had migraines
like my father had.

00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:00.170 align:middle line:90%
And his mother, it was genetic.

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:03.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, and if I ate
the wrong foods,

00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:05.010 align:middle line:90%
I would get migraine headaches.

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:08.170 align:middle line:84%
So I learned early on I
had to eat the right foods.

00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:11.010 align:middle line:84%
However, when we left
Germany originally,

00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:13.620 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have our own
cooking, our own apartment,

00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:14.890 align:middle line:90%
our own place.

00:55:14.890 --> 00:55:16.080 align:middle line:90%
And we had to go out.

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:18.780 align:middle line:84%
We would go into
vegetarian restaurants,

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:20.460 align:middle line:84%
but it was restaurant
food, and it

00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:22.570 align:middle line:90%
was probably salted, and so on.

00:55:22.570 --> 00:55:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And my own defenses that were
none too good to begin with

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.060 align:middle line:90%
were down.

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And my father was always
working with TB patients.

00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:35.970 align:middle line:90%
I got bone tuberculosis.

00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:36.990 align:middle line:90%
In those days.

00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:40.590 align:middle line:90%
I was 12, so that was in 1934.

00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:45.000 align:middle line:84%
There were no antibiotics,
nothing for TB.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And bone tuberculosis
was deadly.

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:51.900 align:middle line:84%
It was quite definitely
a fatal disease.

00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, they
could have cut my leg off,

00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:58.760 align:middle line:90%
but I had a hole in my bone.

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.020 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, he healed it.

00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:00.820 align:middle line:90%
Here I am.

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>> And here you are.

00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, but you see, I had
to be careful all my life.

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:08.970 align:middle line:90%
I had to eat the right foods.

00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:10.550 align:middle line:90%
I had to avoid chemicals.

00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:13.310 align:middle line:84%
I had to avoid salt, and
meat, and fish, and chicken,

00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:14.480 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:18.110 align:middle line:84%
I had to avoid the
chemicalized stuff

00:56:18.110 --> 00:56:20.360 align:middle line:90%
and eat organic and vegetarian.

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Do I have osteoporosis?

00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:22.550 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Do I take calcium?

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:23.960 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:24.920 align:middle line:90%
Do I take hormones?

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:29.210 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't need it, because
it's a milk, and the hormones,

00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:32.645 align:middle line:84%
and the calcium that
causes osteoporosis.

00:56:32.645 --> 00:56:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So the byproduct of your
original frailty is having

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:41.730 align:middle line:84%
to treat yourself properly and
live to an incredibly healthy,

00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:44.350 align:middle line:90%
and energetic, and active age.

00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:45.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Old age.

00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Old ages, yes.

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, let's face it--

00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.950 align:middle line:90%
pushing 90!

00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:50.163 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yeah, 70 would
be considered old age.

00:56:50.163 --> 00:56:51.830 align:middle line:84%
OK, we don't like to
use the "old" word,

00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:53.180 align:middle line:90%
but I guess there you have it.

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't care.

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:54.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a number.

00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:56.110 align:middle line:84%
As far as I'm concerned,
it's a number.

00:56:56.110 --> 00:56:56.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm busy.

00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:58.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm active.

00:56:58.130 --> 00:57:00.737 align:middle line:84%
Can you see me sitting
in front of a TV

00:57:00.737 --> 00:57:01.820 align:middle line:90%
in a rocker doing nothing?

00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] No.

00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't do that.

00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>> No, that's not your path.

00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I go once a week to Mexico.

00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:07.850 align:middle line:90%
I talk to all the patients.

00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And I do lectures, and help
them understand the therapy,

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:14.690 align:middle line:84%
and I help encourage
them, and so on.

00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:16.430 align:middle line:90%
It's important to me.

00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:17.930 align:middle line:90%
And I write the newsletter.

00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I write the reports
on the patients.

00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And we do some of
the corrections,

00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:27.830 align:middle line:90%
and I do a lot of interviews.

00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:29.180 align:middle line:90%
And I'm busy.

00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>> You're wearing me out
just hearing about it.

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, on that note,
thank you so much, again,

00:57:34.490 --> 00:57:37.832 align:middle line:84%
for taking time on your
birthday, your 87th birthday.

00:57:37.832 --> 00:57:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to drop by
and have a glass of juice,

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.260 align:middle line:84%
hopefully, before we have
to hit the road again.

00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:44.790 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for your--
