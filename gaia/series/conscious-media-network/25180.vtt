00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:14.367
<v ->There appears to be a fundamental reality</v>

2
00:00:14.367 --> 00:00:16.359
that exists within the nature of women.

3
00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.327
We question our own value.

4
00:00:18.327 --> 00:00:20.463
Fostered perhaps by millennia of being kept

5
00:00:20.463 --> 00:00:22.671
in the background, even the most successful women

6
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:26.175
on the planet still feel that they somehow aren't enough.

7
00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:29.727
Amy Ahlers is a vivacious life coach who invariably

8
00:00:29.727 --> 00:00:32.055
ran up against this negative inner dialogue

9
00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:33.519
with her female clients.

10
00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:35.559
It prompted her to write a book with the tongue-in-cheek

11
00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.543
title called "The Big Fat Lies Women Tell Themselves."

12
00:00:39.543 --> 00:00:42.495
Though the title is playful, the information is powerful

13
00:00:42.495 --> 00:00:45.241
and addresses an epidemic dysfunction.

14
00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:48.525
<v Voiceover>This is a subject that I believe</v>

15
00:00:48.525 --> 00:00:52.663
every female watching is going to relate to.

16
00:00:53.013 --> 00:00:55.534
And it's something that seems to be endemic to

17
00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:57.309
being feminine on this planet.

18
00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:58.462
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

19
00:00:58.462 --> 00:01:00.261
<v Voiceover>And you've written this book,</v>

20
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:01.245
which is really fun.

21
00:01:01.245 --> 00:01:03.789
"Big Fat Lies Women Tell Themselves."

22
00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.287
You also have some anecdotes to share with us as well.

23
00:01:08.542 --> 00:01:12.069
You and a partner of yours have also created

24
00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:14.541
the Inner Mean Girl Reform School.

25
00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:15.285
<v ->That's right.</v>

26
00:01:15.285 --> 00:01:16.437
<v Voiceover>I think that's so cute.</v>

27
00:01:16.437 --> 00:01:17.325
(laughs)

28
00:01:17.325 --> 00:01:19.653
And it is, all of this is very kind of tongue-in-cheek

29
00:01:19.653 --> 00:01:22.413
and cute, but it's actually something grounded in serious

30
00:01:22.413 --> 00:01:23.062
business.

31
00:01:23.062 --> 00:01:24.573
You've coached a lot of people in your life

32
00:01:24.573 --> 00:01:25.965
and you started seeing this pattern.

33
00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:27.309
<v ->I did, yeah.</v>

34
00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:30.622
So I've been coaching for over a decade now.

35
00:01:30.622 --> 00:01:33.358
Really women and men from all walks of life

36
00:01:33.358 --> 00:01:35.541
and one of the things that I've noticed

37
00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:38.037
was that no matter how smart, no matter how

38
00:01:38.037 --> 00:01:40.413
successful, no matter how beautiful, no matter

39
00:01:40.413 --> 00:01:45.357
how rich, no matter how thin even, women on some level

40
00:01:45.357 --> 00:01:48.367
are being way too hard on themselves.

41
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:52.941
When I first started coaching, I really was coaching

42
00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:56.326
women and men that were in a lower income bracket.

43
00:01:56.326 --> 00:01:58.461
A lot of people that were struggling with their career.

44
00:01:58.461 --> 00:02:00.550
When I first started coaching, I was younger, so my

45
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.677
clients were younger.

46
00:02:01.677 --> 00:02:05.445
Like attract likes, as you know, your audience knows.

47
00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:08.432
I thought, okay well I get it, these people are

48
00:02:08.432 --> 00:02:10.063
really struggling, and as a coach I would help

49
00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:11.191
them stop struggling.

50
00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:12.103
Great.

51
00:02:12.103 --> 00:02:15.967
As my career has grown, and as I started charging more

52
00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:19.040
and more in my practice, I thought, oh okay, well now I'm

53
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.823
coaching the VPs and the people with the house

54
00:02:21.823 --> 00:02:23.623
and the car and all this stuff.

55
00:02:23.623 --> 00:02:25.567
They're not gonna be so hard on themselves.

56
00:02:25.567 --> 00:02:28.063
But here's the truth, we're all hard on ourselves

57
00:02:28.063 --> 00:02:30.368
despite our external circumstances.

58
00:02:30.368 --> 00:02:33.487
We have women like Oprah saying that she's about to go

59
00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:35.672
and receive her Emmy award and she's beating herself

60
00:02:35.672 --> 00:02:37.639
up for her weight.

61
00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.015
We have people like Elizabeth Gilbert, the author of

62
00:02:40.015 --> 00:02:42.887
"Eat, Pray, Love" saying, "I'm not sure if I wrote

63
00:02:42.887 --> 00:02:44.698
the right kind of books."

64
00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.136
Every woman, and I've coached women in workshops

65
00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:54.191
and one of the questions I ask is, "If you really knew me,

66
00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:56.639
"you would know I'm being really hard on myself

67
00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.401
about blank."

68
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.784
I'll ask everyone listening right now to really

69
00:02:59.784 --> 00:03:01.416
fill in that blank.

70
00:03:01.416 --> 00:03:03.458
Everybody always has an answer.

71
00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:06.520
We're always beating ourself up about something.

72
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.702
And it hurts.

73
00:03:07.702 --> 00:03:10.190
It's not laughing matter, like you said we have these

74
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.206
cute names, Inner Mean Girl Reform School, my book

75
00:03:12.206 --> 00:03:16.417
"Big Fat Lies," but the truth is that this is painful.

76
00:03:16.551 --> 00:03:19.719
It's painful to have this inner life and this inner critic

77
00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:22.382
or inner mean girl as Christine Arylo and I call her,

78
00:03:22.382 --> 00:03:24.566
sitting on your shoulder beating you up.

79
00:03:24.566 --> 00:03:26.366
For all the things that you're not, comparing you

80
00:03:26.366 --> 00:03:28.862
to so and so, all of these things.

81
00:03:28.862 --> 00:03:30.351
Beating you up, saying you're not enough,

82
00:03:30.351 --> 00:03:31.358
all these things.

83
00:03:31.358 --> 00:03:33.447
It's painful.

84
00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:34.838
What I'm really doing with this book

85
00:03:34.838 --> 00:03:36.519
and the Inner Mean Girl Reform School is saying,

86
00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:37.838
"Let's stop it, ladies.

87
00:03:37.838 --> 00:03:40.080
"It's time for us to knock it off."

88
00:03:41.103 --> 00:03:43.142
<v Voiceover>You draw from a lot of other studies</v>

89
00:03:43.142 --> 00:03:45.711
and information and one of the studies which

90
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.920
the title of it caught my attention has to do with the

91
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.824
declining happiness factor with women.

92
00:03:52.824 --> 00:03:56.184
Here we are, more supposedly empowered than we've

93
00:03:56.184 --> 00:03:59.544
ever been, and that everybody can pretty much afford to

94
00:03:59.544 --> 00:04:01.945
take care of themselves on one level.

95
00:04:01.945 --> 00:04:02.785
<v ->Right, basic needs.</v>

96
00:04:02.785 --> 00:04:03.888
<v Voiceover>Basic needs are--</v>

97
00:04:03.888 --> 00:04:05.232
<v ->Food, shelter, clothing, right we got it.</v>

98
00:04:05.232 --> 00:04:06.312
<v Voiceover>Yeah, we can do all that.</v>

99
00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:09.168
And we can even express ourself in the workforce.

100
00:04:09.168 --> 00:04:11.328
Certainly much more so than in the past.

101
00:04:11.328 --> 00:04:15.624
But still we're actually less happy than we were

102
00:04:15.624 --> 00:04:17.208
35 years ago.

103
00:04:17.208 --> 00:04:18.600
Talk about that for a bit.

104
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.520
What's going on here and also maybe

105
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.736
reflect it to other cultures that may not be quite as

106
00:04:23.736 --> 00:04:28.354
far along as we are in these quote women's rights areas.

107
00:04:28.584 --> 00:04:29.761
<v ->It's a fascinating report.</v>

108
00:04:29.761 --> 00:04:30.672
People can Google it.

109
00:04:30.672 --> 00:04:32.929
It's the paradox of declining happiness.

110
00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:36.558
In this report they really do these studies like you said,

111
00:04:36.558 --> 00:04:39.726
of that over the last 35 years, women have become more

112
00:04:39.726 --> 00:04:41.910
empowered and yet here we are with our happiness

113
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.486
declining, and I really feel like as society,

114
00:04:45.486 --> 00:04:49.134
especially in Western culture, we bought this bill of goods.

115
00:04:49.134 --> 00:04:50.382
The when-then lie.

116
00:04:50.382 --> 00:04:52.327
This is one of the lies of my book as well.

117
00:04:52.327 --> 00:04:54.726
When I get the car, when I get the job, when I get

118
00:04:54.726 --> 00:04:57.894
the guy, when I get the house, then I'm gonna be happy.

119
00:04:57.894 --> 00:05:01.615
When I lose 15 pounds, then I'm gonna be happy.

120
00:05:01.615 --> 00:05:03.943
We have this happiness carrot always dangling

121
00:05:03.943 --> 00:05:05.863
just out of reach.

122
00:05:05.863 --> 00:05:07.590
It's even in the U.S. Constitution.

123
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.175
The pursuit of happiness.

124
00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:11.310
What about happiness right now?

125
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.350
What's up with that?

126
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.462
I think that one of the things, I think that this was an

127
00:05:15.462 --> 00:05:18.126
unintended, and Christine Arylo talks about this

128
00:05:18.126 --> 00:05:21.270
beautifully, my partner at Inner Mean Girl Reform School.

129
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.222
It really is one of the unintended things of the feminist

130
00:05:24.222 --> 00:05:29.222
movement, was that we were taught that we can do anything

131
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.184
and so now we feel like we have to do everything.

132
00:05:34.302 --> 00:05:37.039
That, it's like all these things got added to our plate

133
00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.078
and nothing got moved off our plate.

134
00:05:39.078 --> 00:05:41.574
There's all these studies showing that women even though

135
00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:44.358
we're also bringing home the bacon, so to speak,

136
00:05:44.358 --> 00:05:45.967
we still are the ones that are doing the majority

137
00:05:45.967 --> 00:05:47.670
of the housework.

138
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.846
Even though we're contributing so much to our families

139
00:05:51.846 --> 00:05:54.559
and households, our finances there, we're still the ones

140
00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:57.030
that are doing the grocery shopping, and taking care

141
00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.599
of the kids for the most part.

142
00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:02.022
We're supposed to be superwomen, and the reality is

143
00:06:02.022 --> 00:06:05.478
that nobody can put up with that kind of pressure.

144
00:06:05.478 --> 00:06:07.961
It's just an unrealistic expectation.

145
00:06:08.406 --> 00:06:11.598
<v Voiceover>How does that conversely affect the men</v>

146
00:06:11.598 --> 00:06:14.862
in a relative scale of happiness, if there's a decline

147
00:06:14.862 --> 00:06:17.416
effect for the women, what's happening with the men?

148
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.500
<v ->It's interesting, I'd love to see a study on that</v>

149
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.918
actually, about men's happiness, but what I know from

150
00:06:21.918 --> 00:06:24.415
my experience in coaching men is that there's also this

151
00:06:24.415 --> 00:06:26.677
decline for men in their happiness.

152
00:06:26.677 --> 00:06:28.730
We look at the studies on depression and we see that

153
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.330
twice as many women are affected by depression

154
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.630
than men.

155
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.540
Interesting.

156
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.802
But I think all of the levels are going up.

157
00:06:35.802 --> 00:06:37.206
And I think some people would just say is it

158
00:06:37.206 --> 00:06:38.350
just being overdiagnosed.

159
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.249
I think that could be partially true.

160
00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:43.109
But I also think that this bill of goods that we've

161
00:06:43.109 --> 00:06:45.682
been sold, that it's all about this, and we see this

162
00:06:45.682 --> 00:06:48.412
in the collapse with the economy, it's like,

163
00:06:48.412 --> 00:06:50.128
oh all these people thought if I just--

164
00:06:50.128 --> 00:06:52.442
I'm gonna get into debt, going after this American

165
00:06:52.442 --> 00:06:54.964
Dream, and then all of a sudden it comes all

166
00:06:54.964 --> 00:06:57.408
crashing down, what's left?

167
00:06:58.406 --> 00:07:02.071
I think for men it's also become very very confusing

168
00:07:02.071 --> 00:07:04.437
because where is their role?

169
00:07:04.437 --> 00:07:06.387
They're not the sole breadwinners anymore,

170
00:07:06.387 --> 00:07:08.285
the majority of households.

171
00:07:08.285 --> 00:07:11.484
Then what are they responsible for?

172
00:07:11.484 --> 00:07:14.473
I think in my work with men there is that decline

173
00:07:14.473 --> 00:07:15.669
of happiness as well.

174
00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:19.414
There's more depression, there's this feeling of being lost.

175
00:07:19.414 --> 00:07:22.768
There also is men being really really hard on themselves.

176
00:07:22.768 --> 00:07:25.237
They're just hard on themselves in different ways.

177
00:07:25.237 --> 00:07:27.941
I think the big fat lie for men that's probably number one

178
00:07:27.941 --> 00:07:30.360
is "I'm a loser," or "I'm not contributing enough,"

179
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.205
or "I don't know how to show up as a man anymore

180
00:07:32.205 --> 00:07:34.987
"'cause my woman, my partner is so powerful.

181
00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:36.885
"How am I supposed to show up?"

182
00:07:36.885 --> 00:07:40.499
I think all of this has really brought about a decline

183
00:07:40.499 --> 00:07:42.449
for everybody in their happiness.

184
00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:44.192
And I think it's time we really take a stand to really

185
00:07:44.192 --> 00:07:45.206
bring it back.

186
00:07:45.206 --> 00:07:46.272
<v Voiceover>I think so too.</v>

187
00:07:46.272 --> 00:07:50.483
How much is the prevailing culture, media, and so forth

188
00:07:50.483 --> 00:07:53.135
really perpetuating these kinds of false ideals

189
00:07:53.135 --> 00:07:54.695
that are taking people down?

190
00:07:54.695 --> 00:07:56.802
Because of subliminal programming, if nothing else.

191
00:07:56.802 --> 00:07:57.607
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

192
00:07:57.607 --> 00:08:00.545
When you look at the media, you can see

193
00:08:00.545 --> 00:08:02.487
Jean Kilbourne's a wonderful media expert,

194
00:08:02.487 --> 00:08:04.772
I've derived so much information from her,

195
00:08:04.772 --> 00:08:06.124
she's incredible.

196
00:08:06.124 --> 00:08:07.060
<v Voiceover>Jean Kilbourne?</v>

197
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.336
<v ->Jean Kilbourne, yeah, and when you look at her stuff,</v>

198
00:08:10.336 --> 00:08:13.950
what you'll find is that the majority of the messaging

199
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.862
going on, the programming in advertising and in marketing

200
00:08:16.862 --> 00:08:19.358
first of all the number one thing they're saying,

201
00:08:19.358 --> 00:08:23.570
subliminally, subconsciously, is you are not enough.

202
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.078
Your wrinkles mean you're not enough, your

203
00:08:25.078 --> 00:08:26.872
thighs mean you're not enough, and by the way

204
00:08:26.872 --> 00:08:28.822
I have a solution for you, right?

205
00:08:28.822 --> 00:08:30.122
Oh you can buy this cream, you can do this,

206
00:08:30.122 --> 00:08:32.280
you can get Botox, all this crap that we're

207
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.892
being fed around that.

208
00:08:33.892 --> 00:08:35.868
But the underlying message always is

209
00:08:35.868 --> 00:08:37.688
you are not enough.

210
00:08:37.688 --> 00:08:40.418
We've been fed that message since the birth,

211
00:08:40.418 --> 00:08:42.186
really, since the day that we're born.

212
00:08:42.186 --> 00:08:44.422
Kids--I have a four year old daughter, Annabella,

213
00:08:44.422 --> 00:08:45.956
I see it already in the programming.

214
00:08:45.956 --> 00:08:46.866
You're not, like--

215
00:08:46.866 --> 00:08:48.426
Here, this doll's gonna make you happy.

216
00:08:48.426 --> 00:08:51.832
All of this stuff goes into our subconscious mind.

217
00:08:51.832 --> 00:08:55.238
Studies show that 92% of it goes into our

218
00:08:55.238 --> 00:08:56.356
subconscious mind.

219
00:08:56.356 --> 00:08:59.918
Only 8% do we register consciously.

220
00:08:59.918 --> 00:09:03.246
There is just this huge onslaught of I am not

221
00:09:03.246 --> 00:09:07.640
enough-ness going on in the world, and the media,

222
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.902
the cost is detrimental.

223
00:09:09.902 --> 00:09:12.892
When we look at all the studies on anorexia

224
00:09:12.892 --> 00:09:15.050
that's going on, the eating disorders that are going on

225
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:15.960
with young girls--

226
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.026
<v Voiceover>What percentage of the population</v>

227
00:09:17.026 --> 00:09:18.794
has an eating disorder now, among girls?

228
00:09:18.794 --> 00:09:21.186
<v ->It's a good question, I don't know the statistic</v>

229
00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:23.188
but I know that's it's really really high--

230
00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:25.008
<v Voiceover>I remember somewhere, five, 10</v>

231
00:09:25.008 --> 00:09:26.100
million young girls.

232
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.896
<v ->It's insane and I remember some statistic,</v>

233
00:09:29.896 --> 00:09:33.068
and don't quote me on this, but something like,

234
00:09:33.068 --> 00:09:35.590
that most girls before the age of 12 have been

235
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.748
on a diet, the vast majority of girls before age 12.

236
00:09:37.748 --> 00:09:39.464
<v Voiceover>Before age 12.</v>

237
00:09:39.464 --> 00:09:41.180
<v ->I look at my four--</v>

238
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.104
That just makes me wanna cry, honestly.

239
00:09:43.104 --> 00:09:46.094
'Cause I look at my four year old now and I see her at

240
00:09:46.094 --> 00:09:49.780
ballet class looking in the mirror, in her tutu, and she's

241
00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.184
just like--
<v Voiceover>Happy!</v>

242
00:09:51.184 --> 00:09:54.200
<v ->Glowing, and looking at herself and doing moves</v>

243
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.852
and all this, and my inner critic, my inner mean girl

244
00:09:56.852 --> 00:09:58.022
will come up and say, "So when's the

245
00:09:58.022 --> 00:10:00.388
"self-loathing gonna start?"

246
00:10:00.388 --> 00:10:03.430
When is she gonna be--
<v Voiceover>Not good enough.</v>

247
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:05.692
I look funny, my tummy's too big--

248
00:10:05.692 --> 00:10:08.604
<v ->Yeah, I'm too--
<v ->- [Voiceover] Or something.</v>

249
00:10:08.604 --> 00:10:09.514
<v ->Fill in the blank.</v>

250
00:10:09.514 --> 00:10:11.516
I'm too old, I'm too fat, my nose is too big.

251
00:10:11.516 --> 00:10:12.686
My whatever it is.

252
00:10:12.686 --> 00:10:14.298
<v Voiceover>It's such a shame when you see</v>

253
00:10:14.298 --> 00:10:15.546
the innocence in the little one--

254
00:10:15.546 --> 00:10:16.404
<v ->I know.</v>

255
00:10:16.404 --> 00:10:17.704
<v Voiceover>Before they've been spoiled in that way.</v>

256
00:10:17.704 --> 00:10:18.900
Of course you're a conscious mom, so you're gonna

257
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.136
do what you can to see that that doesn't happen.

258
00:10:21.136 --> 00:10:22.852
<v ->Absolutely, and I think modeling is one of the most</v>

259
00:10:22.852 --> 00:10:23.892
important things.

260
00:10:23.892 --> 00:10:26.570
When I'm looking in the mirror, because I gotta tell you

261
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:30.954
especially with a four year old, she mimics me.

262
00:10:31.042 --> 00:10:33.304
I'll catch her saying things that I've said.

263
00:10:33.304 --> 00:10:35.228
Saying things to the dog that I've said to the dog,

264
00:10:35.228 --> 00:10:38.010
saying things to her friends that I've said to my friends.

265
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.856
She now runs around and says, "Big fat lies,

266
00:10:39.856 --> 00:10:41.754
"Mom you big fat lies, all these big fat lies,"

267
00:10:41.754 --> 00:10:43.808
it's adorable and cute.

268
00:10:43.808 --> 00:10:46.772
But when I look in the mirror I know one of the best

269
00:10:46.772 --> 00:10:49.450
gifts that I can give her is saying, "Wow,

270
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.386
"I look really great."

271
00:10:50.386 --> 00:10:52.622
And I try to say this actually out, and subconsciously

272
00:10:52.622 --> 00:10:55.898
program my own subconscious mind to say

273
00:10:55.898 --> 00:10:59.200
these affirmations, which I hugely believe in,

274
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.410
and I also have her doing this self-love hug so she's

275
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:02.892
hugging herself.

276
00:11:02.892 --> 00:11:06.168
I love myself, I love me, we do gratitude practices

277
00:11:06.168 --> 00:11:09.366
around the dinner table, all of those things.

278
00:11:09.366 --> 00:11:11.212
But when she sees me looking in the mirror

279
00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:12.928
and looking at my behind and seeing how do I

280
00:11:12.928 --> 00:11:15.268
look in these jeans, do they fit okay,

281
00:11:15.268 --> 00:11:17.244
and then I always try to say, 'cause I'll watch her

282
00:11:17.244 --> 00:11:19.584
watching me and I'll say, "I look great!"

283
00:11:19.584 --> 00:11:22.106
And she'll go, "Mom, you look so good in those jeans.

284
00:11:22.106 --> 00:11:23.562
"You look beautiful, mommy."

285
00:11:23.562 --> 00:11:25.330
I'm just trying to really model this, I'll let you know

286
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:26.084
how it works.

287
00:11:26.084 --> 00:11:28.060
We get back in 10 years.
<v Voiceover>Yes, please do.</v>

288
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:28.788
(laugh)

289
00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:30.816
<v ->It is, it's such an important thing.</v>

290
00:11:30.816 --> 00:11:32.428
The best gift we can give our daughters is

291
00:11:32.428 --> 00:11:34.872
really nurturing our own self-love.

292
00:11:34.872 --> 00:11:35.782
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

293
00:11:35.782 --> 00:11:36.692
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

294
00:11:36.692 --> 00:11:40.696
<v Voiceover>There was a study maybe 15,</v>

295
00:11:40.696 --> 00:11:42.802
maybe even more years ago now, there was a,

296
00:11:42.802 --> 00:11:44.830
I don't know if it still exists, but there was a magazine

297
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:48.808
called "Omni" that was "Omni Health," and it was more of

298
00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:51.824
the medical version of "Omni" and edition of it.

299
00:11:51.824 --> 00:11:55.490
There was a study I never forgot because it was so profound

300
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.624
and in it it said, it was studying the perceptions

301
00:11:59.624 --> 00:12:02.354
of women in men about themselves and what they

302
00:12:02.354 --> 00:12:05.006
thought the opposite sex found attractive.

303
00:12:05.006 --> 00:12:06.592
<v ->Fascinating.</v>

304
00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:08.559
<v ->It was fascinating, what they did,</v>

305
00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:13.031
the woman had to say, they'd have body types

306
00:12:13.031 --> 00:12:14.929
and different weights and such, and you'd circle which one

307
00:12:14.929 --> 00:12:16.853
you thought you were the most like.

308
00:12:16.853 --> 00:12:19.505
Then you would circle the one, the next one would be

309
00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:22.885
which kind were men most attracted to.

310
00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:26.291
Of course the study ended up women thought that

311
00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:31.291
they were usually heavier than they were, less desireable

312
00:12:31.309 --> 00:12:34.013
than they were, and that whatever kind was preferable to

313
00:12:34.013 --> 00:12:36.379
men was the opposite type of what they were.

314
00:12:36.379 --> 00:12:39.499
Men conversely were the opposite.

315
00:12:39.499 --> 00:12:40.591
<v ->Isn't that interesting?</v>

316
00:12:40.591 --> 00:12:41.813
<v ->They say, "This is my body type."</v>

317
00:12:41.813 --> 00:12:43.581
They choose the one that's bumped up,

318
00:12:43.581 --> 00:12:45.271
a little more fit than they actually were.

319
00:12:45.271 --> 00:12:46.519
What kind do women like?

320
00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:48.183
They like that kind, they'd tickle that kind.

321
00:12:48.183 --> 00:12:49.951
(laughs)

322
00:12:49.951 --> 00:12:51.875
<v ->God bless all the men that are watching.</v>

323
00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:53.695
Good for you, guys.

324
00:12:53.695 --> 00:12:56.919
<v Voiceover>It is, but lemme ask you, having coached</v>

325
00:12:56.919 --> 00:13:01.287
men and women alike, with men do you think it was a--

326
00:13:01.287 --> 00:13:03.497
was that a true finding from your experience

327
00:13:03.497 --> 00:13:06.792
or was that more a sense of bravado or--

328
00:13:06.792 --> 00:13:09.678
trying to wish yourself into this

329
00:13:09.678 --> 00:13:11.732
position of strength in your own mind?

330
00:13:11.732 --> 00:13:14.228
What would that have been reflective of?

331
00:13:14.228 --> 00:13:16.412
<v ->I think that there is especially with men because</v>

332
00:13:16.412 --> 00:13:17.556
they're so--

333
00:13:17.556 --> 00:13:19.974
it's interesting because that was about body type.

334
00:13:19.974 --> 00:13:23.406
I think that because women, we've been so indoctrinated

335
00:13:23.406 --> 00:13:24.992
in that you're supposed to be thinner, younger,

336
00:13:24.992 --> 00:13:27.592
more beautiful, and I think men have been indoctrinated

337
00:13:27.592 --> 00:13:30.660
in, "I'm supposed to be more successful and more wealthy."

338
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.650
I think if that study would have shown how men rate

339
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:37.368
how wealthy they want people to be,

340
00:13:37.368 --> 00:13:39.058
then I think they would have probably rated that

341
00:13:39.058 --> 00:13:41.658
women want men that are more wealthy.

342
00:13:41.658 --> 00:13:43.478
I remember actually from a psychology course

343
00:13:43.478 --> 00:13:48.116
when I was in college, we actually did this where we--

344
00:13:48.756 --> 00:13:50.975
one of my classes forever ago, that it was interesting

345
00:13:50.975 --> 00:13:53.263
because what men were really attracted to

346
00:13:53.263 --> 00:13:55.187
were the women that look like, and this was

347
00:13:55.187 --> 00:13:57.553
all subconscious, that they thought could bear them

348
00:13:57.553 --> 00:13:59.425
children, that looked fertile.

349
00:13:59.425 --> 00:14:00.985
<v Voiceover>And that's been historic.</v>

350
00:14:00.985 --> 00:14:02.493
<v ->So that meant bigger hipper, bigger breasts,</v>

351
00:14:02.493 --> 00:14:04.391
all these things that women are trying to--

352
00:14:04.391 --> 00:14:06.185
Bigger breasts I guess most women are

353
00:14:06.185 --> 00:14:08.499
trying to do, but ask a bigger breasted woman,

354
00:14:08.499 --> 00:14:11.411
myself included, it's gonna be a whole different story.

355
00:14:11.411 --> 00:14:15.207
It was very different, and for women they looked at

356
00:14:15.207 --> 00:14:19.185
the cues about the watches, the way that men were dressed,

357
00:14:19.185 --> 00:14:21.369
they really wanted men that looked like they had more

358
00:14:21.369 --> 00:14:24.177
income level or income potential.

359
00:14:24.177 --> 00:14:26.725
I think that that's an interesting study and I'd

360
00:14:26.725 --> 00:14:28.545
like to see that.

361
00:14:28.545 --> 00:14:30.729
I've really found for men as well, they get

362
00:14:30.729 --> 00:14:34.681
stuck in their mind at the age, in their body,

363
00:14:34.681 --> 00:14:37.593
when they looked their best.

364
00:14:37.593 --> 00:14:39.673
I've noticed this about my husband, he's gonna

365
00:14:39.673 --> 00:14:41.311
kill me for saying this, but it's like,

366
00:14:41.311 --> 00:14:44.067
he still thinks that he looks like he looked when

367
00:14:44.067 --> 00:14:45.471
he was in his 20s.

368
00:14:45.471 --> 00:14:47.993
He's in his 40s now and he's adorable and hot

369
00:14:47.993 --> 00:14:50.151
and I love him, and he's dreamy to me,

370
00:14:50.151 --> 00:14:53.349
and honey, no you're not a size 32 waist anymore.

371
00:14:53.349 --> 00:14:55.559
Sweetie, it's not true.

372
00:14:55.559 --> 00:14:57.535
But in his mind he's always a little bit shocked

373
00:14:57.535 --> 00:15:00.707
and appalled, where I think with women they pay so

374
00:15:00.707 --> 00:15:02.761
much attention to how their body looks.

375
00:15:02.761 --> 00:15:04.633
They know exactly if they've gained five pounds

376
00:15:04.633 --> 00:15:06.609
or lost five pounds.

377
00:15:06.609 --> 00:15:08.611
I think it's an interesting thing.

378
00:15:08.611 --> 00:15:10.353
I think men are much harder on themselves

379
00:15:10.353 --> 00:15:13.603
about success and about career.

380
00:15:13.603 --> 00:15:15.761
<v Voiceover>That's something I wanted to</v>

381
00:15:15.761 --> 00:15:18.205
bring up also, this was another--

382
00:15:18.205 --> 00:15:20.051
a friend of mine told me about this because

383
00:15:20.051 --> 00:15:22.599
I was beating myself up over something.

384
00:15:22.599 --> 00:15:25.277
About again, 15, 20 years ago, I don't know

385
00:15:25.277 --> 00:15:26.941
what was going on then, but we were just

386
00:15:26.941 --> 00:15:29.073
having conversation, I was trying to get another part

387
00:15:29.073 --> 00:15:31.595
of my media career going 'cause I've been a self-starter

388
00:15:31.595 --> 00:15:34.221
and it's hard to get projects going sometimes.

389
00:15:34.221 --> 00:15:36.639
He said, "Just go do it."

390
00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:38.979
He said, "You don't have to be perfect."

391
00:15:38.979 --> 00:15:42.385
He told me about a study that had been done with

392
00:15:42.385 --> 00:15:47.385
Fortune 500 CEOs and it queried them on a number of things,

393
00:15:47.897 --> 00:15:51.121
but number one it asked, "What's your greatest fear?"

394
00:15:51.121 --> 00:15:52.109
<v ->Interesting.</v>

395
00:15:52.109 --> 00:15:53.799
<v Voiceover>And they said their greatest fear was</v>

396
00:15:53.799 --> 00:15:56.425
to be found out that they were a fraud, a fake.

397
00:15:56.425 --> 00:15:57.725
<v ->That's right, big fat lie--</v>

398
00:15:57.725 --> 00:15:59.259
I'm a fraud.
<v Voiceover>Not competent.</v>

399
00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:00.065
<v ->That's it.</v>

400
00:16:00.065 --> 00:16:01.365
<v Voiceover>These are the ones that are running</v>

401
00:16:01.365 --> 00:16:03.185
the largest corporations, certainly in America,

402
00:16:03.185 --> 00:16:04.485
some in the world.

403
00:16:04.485 --> 00:16:06.253
And they thought they were gonna be discovered

404
00:16:06.253 --> 00:16:07.267
to be frauds.

405
00:16:08.162 --> 00:16:09.462
<v ->Does not surprise me.</v>

406
00:16:09.462 --> 00:16:10.580
I'm getting chills right now.

407
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.114
That does not surprise me at all.

408
00:16:13.647 --> 00:16:15.805
One of the things that I've been doing for my book

409
00:16:15.805 --> 00:16:18.873
has actually been interviewing other luminaries

410
00:16:18.873 --> 00:16:22.253
about their big fat lies, and I've done some remarkable

411
00:16:22.253 --> 00:16:24.073
interviews with people.

412
00:16:24.073 --> 00:16:25.529
<v Voiceover>Please share a couple, if you're free to</v>

413
00:16:25.529 --> 00:16:27.323
I'd love to hear about this.

414
00:16:27.323 --> 00:16:28.493
Men and women.

415
00:16:28.493 --> 00:16:31.119
<v ->I've been interviewing women like Lisa Nichols</v>

416
00:16:31.119 --> 00:16:35.149
and Marci Shimoff, bestselling authors, and I've asked them

417
00:16:35.149 --> 00:16:36.657
in their interview toward the end.

418
00:16:36.657 --> 00:16:37.723
I've asked them about the big fat lies

419
00:16:37.723 --> 00:16:39.361
they've uncovered in their work.

420
00:16:39.361 --> 00:16:41.571
But then I also ask them about the big fat lies

421
00:16:41.571 --> 00:16:44.769
that are still currently going on with them.

422
00:16:44.769 --> 00:16:47.369
Arielle Ford's big fat lie actually sticks out to me.

423
00:16:47.369 --> 00:16:49.163
Arielle Ford, she's the bestselling author

424
00:16:49.163 --> 00:16:51.477
of "The Soulmate Secret."

425
00:16:51.477 --> 00:16:54.909
She's the one that jumpstarted Deepak Chopra's career.

426
00:16:54.909 --> 00:16:57.223
She's a publicist back in the day and then has

427
00:16:57.223 --> 00:17:00.629
now moved into an author and speaker in her own right.

428
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:02.735
Her big fat lie that still runs the show is

429
00:17:02.735 --> 00:17:05.413
I'm not doing enough.

430
00:17:05.413 --> 00:17:06.583
I'm not doing enough.

431
00:17:06.583 --> 00:17:08.975
The person who's jumpstarted Deepak Chopra.

432
00:17:08.975 --> 00:17:11.627
This woman has so many projects going on.

433
00:17:11.627 --> 00:17:14.019
She's incredibly successful.

434
00:17:14.019 --> 00:17:17.373
To know that she's beating herself up with that lie

435
00:17:17.373 --> 00:17:20.467
is, I'm just like, oh my gosh.

436
00:17:20.467 --> 00:17:21.897
<v Voiceover>Where does it end?</v>

437
00:17:21.897 --> 00:17:23.301
<v ->It doesn't, that's the thing.</v>

438
00:17:23.301 --> 00:17:24.055
It doesn't.

439
00:17:24.055 --> 00:17:26.291
This is the human experience for men and women alike.

440
00:17:26.291 --> 00:17:28.322
But I think women in particular are just

441
00:17:28.322 --> 00:17:29.648
more in touch with it.

442
00:17:29.648 --> 00:17:31.156
They're more in touch and they're more honest

443
00:17:31.156 --> 00:17:34.536
and vulnerable about those lies.

444
00:17:34.536 --> 00:17:37.573
<v Voiceover>If we were to look at it, it's</v>

445
00:17:37.573 --> 00:17:41.005
when there was a time historically that

446
00:17:41.005 --> 00:17:43.111
life was relatively simple.

447
00:17:43.111 --> 00:17:46.257
Maybe you were a blacksmith or a blacksmith's wife.

448
00:17:46.257 --> 00:17:47.687
The chores were expected.

449
00:17:47.687 --> 00:17:50.001
I think that's why you're seeing this decline--

450
00:17:50.001 --> 00:17:50.911
<v ->Decline.</v>

451
00:17:50.911 --> 00:17:51.951
<v Voiceover>In happiness.</v>

452
00:17:51.951 --> 00:17:53.901
When there was just a simple acceptance

453
00:17:53.901 --> 00:17:56.605
and understanding of one's position, whatever that was,

454
00:17:56.605 --> 00:17:58.035
and you did the best you could within it,

455
00:17:58.035 --> 00:17:59.829
and you may struggle, there might not be enough.

456
00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:01.467
You might have too many children.

457
00:18:01.467 --> 00:18:04.795
But that really deep level of anxiety would have been

458
00:18:04.795 --> 00:18:06.537
quite different.

459
00:18:06.537 --> 00:18:09.891
More survival-oriented than just an all-pervasive

460
00:18:09.891 --> 00:18:11.737
level of not being good enough.

461
00:18:11.737 --> 00:18:14.467
I wonder if we could reflect back a couple hundred

462
00:18:14.467 --> 00:18:17.197
and beyond years, if that would have even

463
00:18:17.197 --> 00:18:19.979
registered, that kind of low level anxiety that we're

464
00:18:19.979 --> 00:18:21.409
having today.

465
00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:24.035
<v ->Right. I think you mentioned third world countries.</v>

466
00:18:24.035 --> 00:18:26.427
I think we can actually look at that from the perspective

467
00:18:26.427 --> 00:18:27.571
of Western cultures.

468
00:18:27.571 --> 00:18:28.507
<v Voiceover>What have you seen?</v>

469
00:18:28.507 --> 00:18:29.729
<v ->Versus third world nations.</v>

470
00:18:29.729 --> 00:18:31.965
As long as people's food, shelter, and clothing,

471
00:18:31.965 --> 00:18:33.525
those basic needs when you look at

472
00:18:33.525 --> 00:18:38.049
Maslow's hierarchy of needs, I believe it is,

473
00:18:38.049 --> 00:18:41.351
and you really look at if you know your food

474
00:18:41.351 --> 00:18:43.119
is covered, your shelter is covered, and your clothing

475
00:18:43.119 --> 00:18:46.343
is covered, once those basic needs are met,

476
00:18:46.343 --> 00:18:49.463
then you are not going to be seeing all of these things

477
00:18:49.463 --> 00:18:52.716
about depression, the way that you do in Western societies

478
00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:54.689
that are saying, "You're supposed to be more,

479
00:18:54.689 --> 00:18:56.431
"have more, do more."

480
00:18:56.431 --> 00:18:59.785
I think when we go and we see people in third world

481
00:18:59.785 --> 00:19:02.645
nations, as long as they have those basic needs met, you're

482
00:19:02.645 --> 00:19:04.387
gonna see a lot more joy.

483
00:19:04.387 --> 00:19:06.441
You can see it on people's faces without

484
00:19:06.441 --> 00:19:07.897
even doing a study.

485
00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:10.679
I think we make the assumption as people that

486
00:19:10.679 --> 00:19:13.305
are in Western society, that oh my gosh,

487
00:19:13.305 --> 00:19:15.047
they must feel so miserable, they don't have the car,

488
00:19:15.047 --> 00:19:16.529
they don't have this.

489
00:19:16.529 --> 00:19:18.037
But really take a look.

490
00:19:18.037 --> 00:19:19.727
<v Voiceover>When I've traveled in third world nations</v>

491
00:19:19.727 --> 00:19:21.209
what I notice is even though

492
00:19:21.209 --> 00:19:23.081
there are other issues--
<v ->Of course.</v>

493
00:19:23.081 --> 00:19:24.511
<v Voiceover>You might still have domestic violence,</v>

494
00:19:24.511 --> 00:19:25.915
for example, in some of these cultures, a lot

495
00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:27.267
of the cultures.

496
00:19:28.242 --> 00:19:29.932
That's something to have to deal with.

497
00:19:29.932 --> 00:19:31.804
That certainly is not good for a woman's self-esteem

498
00:19:31.804 --> 00:19:35.533
but overall, the level of,

499
00:19:36.583 --> 00:19:38.039
again I use the word anxiety,

500
00:19:38.039 --> 00:19:40.717
that shows on our faces, it shows in the way we dart

501
00:19:40.717 --> 00:19:43.239
around through our lives, the way our eyes move,

502
00:19:43.239 --> 00:19:45.917
the way we drive, the women in a lot of these cultures

503
00:19:45.917 --> 00:19:47.399
do not have that.

504
00:19:47.399 --> 00:19:51.367
It's a much more fluid.

505
00:19:51.897 --> 00:19:55.329
They may have sadness in them from stuff going on

506
00:19:55.329 --> 00:19:59.775
at home, but there's a type of relaxation at the core.

507
00:19:59.775 --> 00:20:02.453
I don't know if that's the right word.

508
00:20:02.453 --> 00:20:03.441
You know what I'm saying?

509
00:20:03.441 --> 00:20:04.247
<v ->I do.</v>

510
00:20:04.247 --> 00:20:05.135
I think that there's peace.

511
00:20:05.135 --> 00:20:06.669
<v Voiceover>The lack of that edgy anxiety.</v>

512
00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:07.761
<v ->There's peace.
<v Voiceover>There's more</v>

513
00:20:07.761 --> 00:20:08.439
peace at the core.
<v Voiceover>Even of the sad</v>

514
00:20:08.439 --> 00:20:09.102
women.
<v ->I think that's right.</v>

515
00:20:09.411 --> 00:20:11.023
<v Voiceover>That have gone through some rough stuff</v>

516
00:20:11.023 --> 00:20:13.285
than what we're seeing with women now.

517
00:20:13.285 --> 00:20:14.819
I know a lot of successful women.

518
00:20:14.819 --> 00:20:17.601
My girlfriends have all done well

519
00:20:17.601 --> 00:20:20.409
and have good careers going and everything.

520
00:20:20.409 --> 00:20:23.529
And still there's this anxiety.

521
00:20:23.529 --> 00:20:26.025
It's like a bottomless pit.

522
00:20:26.025 --> 00:20:29.275
Of course, we could go into a highly esoteric conversation

523
00:20:29.275 --> 00:20:32.473
at this point and talk about in terms of Maslow's

524
00:20:32.473 --> 00:20:35.879
hierarchy of needs also, this connection for divine

525
00:20:35.879 --> 00:20:37.725
and soul and spiritual expression.

526
00:20:37.725 --> 00:20:39.571
Obviously going up is where we're gonna find

527
00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:40.455
a lot of that.

528
00:20:40.455 --> 00:20:41.703
It's going into ourselves.

529
00:20:41.703 --> 00:20:46.434
In the interim, we need to find ways to actually

530
00:20:46.434 --> 00:20:47.962
deal with it and manage it.

531
00:20:47.962 --> 00:20:50.380
And this is really what I see you trying to do

532
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.344
and you're doing with your work and with your book.

533
00:20:53.344 --> 00:20:54.592
<v ->Thank you. Thanks for noticing that.</v>

534
00:20:54.592 --> 00:20:56.854
You're exactly right.

535
00:20:56.854 --> 00:20:59.377
I remember a while ago I heard about a study,

536
00:20:59.377 --> 00:21:01.456
I think it's commonly known, this study that said

537
00:21:01.456 --> 00:21:04.978
the number one fear people have is speaking in public.

538
00:21:04.978 --> 00:21:06.876
You remember the fear of public speaking, right?

539
00:21:06.876 --> 00:21:07.968
<v Voiceover>Oh god, big time, I have that.</v>

540
00:21:07.968 --> 00:21:08.670
<v ->You have that?</v>

541
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:09.996
<v Voiceover>Hugely, I'm a total introvert.</v>

542
00:21:09.996 --> 00:21:11.218
<v ->Isn't that interesting.</v>

543
00:21:11.218 --> 00:21:12.622
That's so fascinating, isn't that fascinating.

544
00:21:12.622 --> 00:21:14.182
Oh my gosh.

545
00:21:14.182 --> 00:21:17.146
I remember a study that came out a few years ago

546
00:21:17.146 --> 00:21:20.709
that I heard about that said that that's being replaced

547
00:21:20.709 --> 00:21:25.154
by the fear of not having enough meaning in your life.

548
00:21:25.154 --> 00:21:26.636
<v Voiceover>That's a good thing.</v>

549
00:21:26.636 --> 00:21:27.676
<v ->Living a life with no meaning.</v>

550
00:21:27.676 --> 00:21:29.262
<v Voiceover>That's a good thing, that's good sign.</v>

551
00:21:29.262 --> 00:21:32.279
<v ->I agree. I agree.</v>

552
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.010
The money and the material things are not gonna be

553
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.948
the things that give you more meaning in your life.

554
00:21:39.948 --> 00:21:42.081
<v Voiceover>Wired Magazine a few years ago was talking</v>

555
00:21:42.081 --> 00:21:44.618
about the new

556
00:21:47.644 --> 00:21:49.776
it wasn't hierarchy of needs but what was going to be

557
00:21:49.776 --> 00:21:51.310
the value in the future.

558
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:54.405
It said we're now entering a time when wisdom is gonna be

559
00:21:54.405 --> 00:21:56.432
the primary commodity of value.

560
00:21:56.432 --> 00:21:57.316
<v ->Interesting.</v>

561
00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:59.916
<v ->We're not seeing it too much yet in our political arena,</v>

562
00:21:59.916 --> 00:22:03.686
economic or any other place, but as you say that study

563
00:22:03.686 --> 00:22:07.326
is a very good indication that in the hearts of the people

564
00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:10.031
of the planet, that's already starting to take place.

565
00:22:10.031 --> 00:22:13.358
<v ->This is really where I found my sweet spot with coaching.</v>

566
00:22:13.358 --> 00:22:17.076
Has been really helping people find what's meaningful

567
00:22:17.076 --> 00:22:21.746
to you, what's gonna really on a soul level fulfill you.

568
00:22:21.808 --> 00:22:23.550
I've coached people that are in the beginning of their

569
00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:26.176
careers, and I've coached people that went and became

570
00:22:26.176 --> 00:22:29.920
the lawyer or the doctor or the VP and got all the things

571
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.937
that they thought they wanted, only to find it's not what

572
00:22:32.937 --> 00:22:34.262
I wanted at all.

573
00:22:34.262 --> 00:22:35.328
<v Voiceover>Something's missing still.</v>

574
00:22:35.328 --> 00:22:37.460
<v ->Where's that shortcut for us?</v>

575
00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.748
Can't all of us, especially your viewers in your

576
00:22:39.748 --> 00:22:41.802
audience here, all of them are dedicated to that

577
00:22:41.802 --> 00:22:44.688
consciousness, and so I know, and I trust that they're

578
00:22:44.688 --> 00:22:46.768
looking at all of these questions.

579
00:22:46.768 --> 00:22:48.848
They don't necessarily need to go to a life coach

580
00:22:48.848 --> 00:22:49.992
to have that.

581
00:22:49.992 --> 00:22:51.683
But I gotta tell you, one of the questions that I use

582
00:22:51.683 --> 00:22:55.686
most often in my private coaching is what do you want?

583
00:22:55.686 --> 00:22:56.752
What do you want?

584
00:22:56.752 --> 00:23:00.990
And just having people really get in tune with that.

585
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.252
They get the programming comes in and they're not

586
00:23:03.252 --> 00:23:05.774
even in tune with that, looking at me

587
00:23:05.774 --> 00:23:07.308
with two heads, "What do I want?"

588
00:23:07.308 --> 00:23:08.218
<v Voiceover>What do I want?</v>

589
00:23:08.218 --> 00:23:09.441
<v ->What do I want?</v>

590
00:23:09.441 --> 00:23:10.766
Well lemme really think about that.

591
00:23:10.766 --> 00:23:12.041
I've never thought about that before.

592
00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:14.589
'Cause they've been on a track, you know?

593
00:23:14.589 --> 00:23:16.356
<v Voiceover>In fact, Scott and I were just talking</v>

594
00:23:16.356 --> 00:23:18.280
about that on the way to this interview.

595
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.450
<v ->Oh interesting.</v>

596
00:23:21.104 --> 00:23:22.742
<v Voiceover>A friend of ours in particular, why can't</v>

597
00:23:22.742 --> 00:23:25.473
she just be honest with herself about what she really wants,

598
00:23:25.473 --> 00:23:27.890
then she'd have a chance to perhaps bring that into her life

599
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.803
rather than what should I be?

600
00:23:30.803 --> 00:23:33.636
What should I be saying to be the perfect person?

601
00:23:33.636 --> 00:23:36.990
A woman of my stature, my age, shouldn't want that.

602
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:38.576
I should want this.

603
00:23:38.576 --> 00:23:40.630
And the should should shoulds, we then talk about

604
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:44.816
big fat lies, not even being able to say what we want.

605
00:23:44.816 --> 00:23:45.882
That's huge.

606
00:23:45.882 --> 00:23:47.000
<v ->It is huge.</v>

607
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.664
Everybody that's watching, take a moment.

608
00:23:48.664 --> 00:23:50.433
What do you want?

609
00:23:50.433 --> 00:23:51.524
I'll look at the camera.

610
00:23:51.524 --> 00:23:53.292
What do you want?

611
00:23:53.292 --> 00:23:55.476
Take a minute right now, write it out,

612
00:23:55.476 --> 00:23:57.296
write it down, have a conversation with a friend.

613
00:23:57.296 --> 00:23:58.882
Go to dinner tonight and say, "Let's have a

614
00:23:58.882 --> 00:24:00.936
"what I want conversation."

615
00:24:00.936 --> 00:24:05.434
Things like that really do revolutionize the path

616
00:24:05.434 --> 00:24:06.786
that you're on.

617
00:24:06.786 --> 00:24:08.399
<v Voiceover>Sometimes though we feel embarrassed</v>

618
00:24:08.399 --> 00:24:10.946
to think, what I really want is...

619
00:24:10.946 --> 00:24:14.170
especially the empowered women, it's like, what I really

620
00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.329
want is to take some time off and raise my child

621
00:24:16.329 --> 00:24:20.150
or just not have to worry about money for a year or two.

622
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:21.060
All that.

623
00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.102
A lot of women would say that if they give themselves

624
00:24:24.102 --> 00:24:28.747
permission to be that vulnerable and not the superwoman.

625
00:24:29.744 --> 00:24:31.850
Let's talk about the book and how it's structured,

626
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:33.306
what you're intending to do with it,

627
00:24:33.306 --> 00:24:34.944
how women are utilizing it,

628
00:24:34.944 --> 00:24:37.154
the Inner Mean Girl Reform School,

629
00:24:37.154 --> 00:24:40.758
just give us an idea of what's going on with all of it.

630
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.668
<v ->What I started noticing in my work was not only</v>

631
00:24:44.668 --> 00:24:46.800
were people being hard on themselves, I started noticing

632
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.206
these themes that really women were lying

633
00:24:50.206 --> 00:24:52.000
to themselves.

634
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.405
They weren't really lying to themselves, it was

635
00:24:53.405 --> 00:24:55.380
really their inner critic or their inner mean girl

636
00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.472
that was lying to them.

637
00:24:56.472 --> 00:24:59.410
Really beating them up with big fat lies.

638
00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.869
I started to become an investigator.

639
00:25:02.869 --> 00:25:05.156
I would notice it everywhere.

640
00:25:05.156 --> 00:25:07.600
My reticular activation system and my brain

641
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.212
got fired up.

642
00:25:09.212 --> 00:25:11.318
That part of our brain that collects evidence

643
00:25:11.318 --> 00:25:13.840
and starts noticing when you buy a new red Prius

644
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.609
you notice only red Priuses.

645
00:25:15.609 --> 00:25:17.272
It's not that they were not there before,

646
00:25:17.272 --> 00:25:19.144
it just wasn't important.

647
00:25:19.144 --> 00:25:22.056
I began really uncovering all of these big fat lies.

648
00:25:22.056 --> 00:25:23.512
I started writing them down and saying,

649
00:25:23.512 --> 00:25:25.384
oh, that's another big fat lie.

650
00:25:25.384 --> 00:25:26.866
The waitress that's delivering--

651
00:25:26.866 --> 00:25:29.986
I have a, and I'm sure you have this gift too,

652
00:25:29.986 --> 00:25:33.626
where if I'm whether I'm getting a coffee

653
00:25:33.626 --> 00:25:36.122
or being waited on or striking up a conversation

654
00:25:36.122 --> 00:25:38.176
with the person in line at the grocery store,

655
00:25:38.176 --> 00:25:40.308
I would start finding out these big fat lies

656
00:25:40.308 --> 00:25:43.012
that they would reveal to me and expose to me.

657
00:25:43.012 --> 00:25:45.898
Being the wake up call coach as they call me.

658
00:25:45.898 --> 00:25:47.614
I started making a list and really seeing

659
00:25:47.614 --> 00:25:49.460
some of these themes.

660
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.337
That list then evolved into this book.

661
00:25:52.337 --> 00:25:54.284
<v Voiceover>Which is 59 big fat lies.</v>

662
00:25:54.284 --> 00:25:55.870
<v ->59 big fat lies.</v>

663
00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.430
<v Voiceover>There are quite a number of levels</v>

664
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:58.730
in which we deceive ourselves.

665
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.108
<v ->That's exactly right.</v>

666
00:26:00.108 --> 00:26:02.266
<v Voiceover>Let's take the top three deceptions.</v>

667
00:26:02.266 --> 00:26:05.844
<v ->Okay. I would say the top three.</v>

668
00:26:05.958 --> 00:26:08.766
Lie number one in my book is I am not enough.

669
00:26:08.766 --> 00:26:09.858
Hugely.

670
00:26:09.858 --> 00:26:12.536
It's a core lie that I think every single person on some

671
00:26:12.536 --> 00:26:15.214
level, it all kinda comes down to that one.

672
00:26:15.214 --> 00:26:16.254
I'm not enough.

673
00:26:16.254 --> 00:26:18.100
It can also show up as I'm not worthy,

674
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.348
I'm not valuable.

675
00:26:19.348 --> 00:26:22.364
I am not enough.

676
00:26:22.364 --> 00:26:25.016
Just to be transparent with myself, I know

677
00:26:25.016 --> 00:26:27.486
I turned in my book and I know we were

678
00:26:27.486 --> 00:26:29.254
talking about just recently you turned in your book,

679
00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:31.750
so I don't know if you had this going on for you,

680
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:34.454
but I turned in my book and in that same week

681
00:26:34.454 --> 00:26:36.872
I launched an incredibly successful program called

682
00:26:36.872 --> 00:26:40.044
the Inner Wisdom Golden Circle with Christine Arylo,

683
00:26:40.044 --> 00:26:42.699
and then I got news that Girls Inc.

684
00:26:45.281 --> 00:26:46.808
contacted me and said that I was being honored as a

685
00:26:46.808 --> 00:26:48.134
Women Who Dare award.

686
00:26:48.134 --> 00:26:49.798
<v Voiceover>Yes, fabulous, congratulations.</v>

687
00:26:49.798 --> 00:26:52.398
<v ->Thank you. So amazing.</v>

688
00:26:52.398 --> 00:26:53.412
What did I do?

689
00:26:53.412 --> 00:26:57.000
I went into the shower and bawled my eyes out, sobbing.

690
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.366
<v Voiceover>What was your lie you were telling yourself?</v>

691
00:26:59.366 --> 00:27:00.328
<v ->I'm not enough.</v>

692
00:27:00.328 --> 00:27:01.290
I am not worthy of this.

693
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:02.148
<v Voiceover>You really thought that?</v>

694
00:27:02.148 --> 00:27:03.084
<v ->I did.</v>

695
00:27:03.084 --> 00:27:04.280
Especially writing this, as the author.

696
00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.762
This is my style, everyone.

697
00:27:05.762 --> 00:27:10.676
I'm just as transparent and open, because it's the truth.

698
00:27:10.676 --> 00:27:11.430
I was in the sh--

699
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:12.600
my husband came in, he was like,

700
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.134
"Baby, what's going on?"

701
00:27:14.134 --> 00:27:15.928
I'm like, "I don't deserve that award,

702
00:27:15.928 --> 00:27:17.488
"I'm not enough, I wrote this book

703
00:27:17.488 --> 00:27:19.620
"and here am I in this big fat lie."

704
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.440
I'm just in hysterics.

705
00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.688
I'm laughing about it now, but--

706
00:27:22.688 --> 00:27:23.702
<v Voiceover>Because you thought you were a fraud.</v>

707
00:27:23.702 --> 00:27:25.756
<v ->Exactly. I'm a fraud.</v>

708
00:27:25.756 --> 00:27:26.952
I'm not enough.

709
00:27:26.952 --> 00:27:28.226
How could I ever live up to this?

710
00:27:28.226 --> 00:27:29.812
<v Voiceover>We talked about this off camera.</v>

711
00:27:29.812 --> 00:27:32.074
I just hit the send button for this book that's

712
00:27:32.074 --> 00:27:34.700
under contract and I,

713
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.872
since then, until I heard word this morning,

714
00:27:37.872 --> 00:27:40.420
it's like, "Oh my god, what if people think

715
00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.032
"that I'm an idiot, this is stupid,

716
00:27:42.032 --> 00:27:43.540
"what if no one cares, what if they think

717
00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.788
"it's poorly written?"

718
00:27:44.788 --> 00:27:47.102
Again, I was doing the same thing to myself.

719
00:27:47.102 --> 00:27:48.402
<v ->That's exactly right.</v>

720
00:27:48.402 --> 00:27:50.430
<v Voiceover>Waiting for someone else to validate</v>

721
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:52.380
whether I've done something well.

722
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.862
It's my truth.

723
00:27:53.862 --> 00:27:55.318
How can it be wrong if it's your truth?

724
00:27:55.318 --> 00:27:57.762
But that's what we do.

725
00:27:57.762 --> 00:27:59.478
<v ->That's what we do, it's the human experience.</v>

726
00:27:59.478 --> 00:28:01.584
I think it's always, I always tell my clients

727
00:28:01.584 --> 00:28:03.639
it's a good sign when your inner critic shows up.

728
00:28:03.639 --> 00:28:05.485
It's a good sign when your inner mean girl's beating

729
00:28:05.485 --> 00:28:08.397
you up with big fat lies because it's means you're growing.

730
00:28:08.397 --> 00:28:09.983
It means you're growing, it means you're stretching,

731
00:28:09.983 --> 00:28:11.881
it's mean you're risking, you're getting out of

732
00:28:11.881 --> 00:28:13.051
your comfort zone.

733
00:28:13.051 --> 00:28:15.235
So there I am about to receive this award and I have

734
00:28:15.235 --> 00:28:18.459
all this stuff going on and I'm just in hysterics.

735
00:28:18.459 --> 00:28:21.449
Of course I do my own processes and my own work.

736
00:28:21.449 --> 00:28:23.321
It's not about--

737
00:28:23.321 --> 00:28:25.167
The "Big Fat Lies" book it's not something that

738
00:28:25.167 --> 00:28:27.663
you read it once and then I'm cured, I'm never

739
00:28:27.663 --> 00:28:29.353
gonna be hard on myself again.

740
00:28:29.353 --> 00:28:32.161
I'm not gonna BS people about that, absolutely not.

741
00:28:32.161 --> 00:28:33.851
It's about the human experience.

742
00:28:33.851 --> 00:28:36.087
And having all of the tools in your toolbox

743
00:28:36.087 --> 00:28:38.661
to take out in those moments when you're

744
00:28:38.661 --> 00:28:40.429
beating yourself up.

745
00:28:40.429 --> 00:28:44.017
<v Voiceover>I would like to get the next two lies</v>

746
00:28:44.017 --> 00:28:47.007
and then go into structurally how you work with people

747
00:28:47.007 --> 00:28:48.307
on that.

748
00:28:48.307 --> 00:28:49.347
Can you give a couple of examples?

749
00:28:49.347 --> 00:28:51.141
<v ->Perfect. I'm not enough is one.</v>

750
00:28:51.141 --> 00:28:54.667
I'm unlovable. You're right.

751
00:28:54.703 --> 00:28:57.355
It just always makes me wanna cry because

752
00:28:57.355 --> 00:29:01.229
that particular lie isn't something that I've said to

753
00:29:01.229 --> 00:29:04.739
myself, but I have coached so many people who have

754
00:29:04.739 --> 00:29:07.651
bought into that lie, and a lot of them are people

755
00:29:07.651 --> 00:29:10.121
who are single that don't wanna be single.

756
00:29:10.121 --> 00:29:11.603
They're ready to have that relationship

757
00:29:11.603 --> 00:29:13.033
and they don't have it.

758
00:29:13.033 --> 00:29:15.321
A lot of them have parents or other influences that

759
00:29:15.321 --> 00:29:17.869
told them that kinda horrible stuff when they were

760
00:29:17.869 --> 00:29:19.299
growing up.

761
00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:23.329
The I'm unlovable lie is out there in a huge way.

762
00:29:23.329 --> 00:29:24.655
<v Voiceover>That is very sad.</v>

763
00:29:24.655 --> 00:29:27.905
<v ->It is. It's sad. Very very sad.</v>

764
00:29:27.905 --> 00:29:31.649
The other one that I would say is the comparison one.

765
00:29:31.649 --> 00:29:33.833
So, so and so's so much better than me.

766
00:29:33.833 --> 00:29:37.785
Or could also show up as I'm so much better than so and so.

767
00:29:37.785 --> 00:29:38.929
That comparison lie.

768
00:29:38.929 --> 00:29:40.957
The comparison queen as we call her,

769
00:29:40.957 --> 00:29:42.699
in Inner Mean Girl Reform School.

770
00:29:42.699 --> 00:29:46.469
Hugely popular amongst our inner critics and inner

771
00:29:46.469 --> 00:29:47.691
mean girls.

772
00:29:47.691 --> 00:29:50.525
And really we can beat ourselves up comparing ourselves

773
00:29:50.525 --> 00:29:52.267
to other people all the time.

774
00:29:52.267 --> 00:29:54.399
<v Voiceover>It doesn't matter whether the person</v>

775
00:29:54.399 --> 00:29:58.091
is saying, "That person is so much better than me," or

776
00:29:58.091 --> 00:29:59.703
"I'm so much better than the other person."

777
00:29:59.703 --> 00:30:01.263
It's just the flip side of the exact same

778
00:30:01.263 --> 00:30:02.433
low self-esteem thing.

779
00:30:02.433 --> 00:30:04.747
<v ->That's exactly right. And it's sneaky.</v>

780
00:30:04.747 --> 00:30:06.307
I've had clients that are like, "Oh no, that's

781
00:30:06.307 --> 00:30:08.387
"my self-esteem, that's my self-confidence,

782
00:30:08.387 --> 00:30:10.909
"that's my truth, I'm so much better than so and so."

783
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:11.845
<v Voiceover>But judgment doesn't usually indicate</v>

784
00:30:11.845 --> 00:30:12.781
high self-esteem.

785
00:30:12.781 --> 00:30:14.263
<v ->Honey, that is not. That's right.</v>

786
00:30:14.263 --> 00:30:16.031
That is not your inner wisdom.

787
00:30:16.031 --> 00:30:18.761
That is not true self-confidence.

788
00:30:18.761 --> 00:30:19.957
That is not it at all.

789
00:30:19.957 --> 00:30:21.439
What's the cost of it?

790
00:30:21.439 --> 00:30:23.441
It's keeping you separate from everyone.

791
00:30:23.441 --> 00:30:25.053
People who are really buying into that lie find

792
00:30:25.053 --> 00:30:27.549
they don't have really close relationships.

793
00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:31.449
They don't experience the feeling of being known and seen.

794
00:30:31.449 --> 00:30:33.555
They're the people that are not transparent at all.

795
00:30:33.555 --> 00:30:35.011
They don't have people they feel like can

796
00:30:35.011 --> 00:30:35.973
be vulnerable with.

797
00:30:35.973 --> 00:30:38.885
They're too busy being superior to everybody else.

798
00:30:38.885 --> 00:30:40.055
Huge cost.

799
00:30:40.055 --> 00:30:41.823
I like to say it's like you're being seated

800
00:30:41.823 --> 00:30:45.151
at the far table all the time.

801
00:30:45.151 --> 00:30:47.283
Just out of reach from everyone else.

802
00:30:47.283 --> 00:30:49.077
It's not fun to be that.

803
00:30:49.077 --> 00:30:50.923
<v Voiceover>Very interesting.</v>

804
00:30:50.923 --> 00:30:52.587
So those are the top three.

805
00:30:52.587 --> 00:30:55.889
And now let's look at how when you're working with the book

806
00:30:55.889 --> 00:30:57.969
how you would go about working with it and

807
00:30:57.969 --> 00:30:59.165
use a couple of examples with people.

808
00:30:59.165 --> 00:31:00.387
<v ->Sure, you got it.</v>

809
00:31:00.387 --> 00:31:03.637
The way the book is structured is it has the lie

810
00:31:03.637 --> 00:31:05.067
and then it has the truth.

811
00:31:05.067 --> 00:31:08.136
That's usually where I tell some sort of story,

812
00:31:08.136 --> 00:31:11.126
either a personal story because I'm an open book,

813
00:31:11.126 --> 00:31:12.868
or a story about one of my clients that I coached

814
00:31:12.868 --> 00:31:14.350
around this lie.

815
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.508
And then there's actually a coaching challenge

816
00:31:16.508 --> 00:31:17.574
for you to do.

817
00:31:17.574 --> 00:31:20.330
I am a huge believer in let's not just talk about it,

818
00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:23.018
let's get down and roll up our sleeves

819
00:31:23.018 --> 00:31:24.620
and do the work around it.

820
00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.570
So there's a coaching challenge for every single lie

821
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:29.161
and then there's an affirmation that people can use

822
00:31:29.161 --> 00:31:31.553
and then some sort of inspiring quote from someone

823
00:31:31.553 --> 00:31:34.595
that I admire in the world, whether it's from Gandhi

824
00:31:34.595 --> 00:31:36.441
to Oprah to you name it.

825
00:31:36.441 --> 00:31:37.819
Some sort of inspiring quote.

826
00:31:37.819 --> 00:31:41.121
So there's really 59 tools in the book.

827
00:31:41.121 --> 00:31:43.149
I always like to say it's one of those books

828
00:31:43.149 --> 00:31:45.359
you can read cover to cover or you can keep

829
00:31:45.359 --> 00:31:47.205
in the bathroom, dare I say, and flip open to

830
00:31:47.205 --> 00:31:48.505
a lie at any time.

831
00:31:48.505 --> 00:31:49.545
Or go through the table of contents.

832
00:31:49.545 --> 00:31:51.235
<v Voiceover>The lie that you're relating to in the moment.</v>

833
00:31:51.235 --> 00:31:52.431
<v ->That's exactly right.</v>

834
00:31:52.431 --> 00:31:53.523
<v Voiceover>That's plaguing you in the moment.</v>

835
00:31:53.523 --> 00:31:54.381
<v ->That's exactly right.</v>

836
00:31:54.381 --> 00:31:56.305
<v Voiceover>You really do, there's another element to it.</v>

837
00:31:56.305 --> 00:31:59.607
That is you work with one's own innate inner wisdom.

838
00:31:59.607 --> 00:32:03.169
This is big, it's not like you're telling them.

839
00:32:03.169 --> 00:32:05.639
You're telling them once you've identified this,

840
00:32:05.639 --> 00:32:08.265
there's another part that sits on the other shoulder

841
00:32:08.265 --> 00:32:11.983
that is incredibly wise.

842
00:32:11.983 --> 00:32:15.077
And if you can open yourself to that for just a moment,

843
00:32:15.077 --> 00:32:19.029
turn your head away from the mean girl,

844
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:20.433
and let's talk about that

845
00:32:20.433 --> 00:32:22.773
and maybe some of the things you've seen in terms of

846
00:32:22.773 --> 00:32:25.113
transformation regarding a person accessing their

847
00:32:25.113 --> 00:32:26.075
own wisdom.

848
00:32:26.075 --> 00:32:27.765
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

849
00:32:27.765 --> 00:32:29.923
One of the things maybe this would be a good time for me

850
00:32:29.923 --> 00:32:31.743
to just talk about the three step process

851
00:32:31.743 --> 00:32:32.731
that I've developed.

852
00:32:32.731 --> 00:32:34.551
This is something that's in the introductions

853
00:32:34.551 --> 00:32:36.735
of the book and you can use regardless of the lie

854
00:32:36.735 --> 00:32:37.931
that's going on.

855
00:32:37.931 --> 00:32:39.517
This is a three step process.

856
00:32:39.517 --> 00:32:43.329
The first step is to say, "What is my inner critic saying?"

857
00:32:43.417 --> 00:32:45.445
"What is my inner mean girl saying?"

858
00:32:45.445 --> 00:32:47.239
People often are a little perplexed, like,

859
00:32:47.239 --> 00:32:49.475
"I don't wanna admit what's going on there.

860
00:32:49.475 --> 00:32:51.503
"I don't wanna say all these negative things.

861
00:32:51.503 --> 00:32:52.751
"I believe in the law of attraction.

862
00:32:52.751 --> 00:32:54.311
"I don't wanna say these negative things."

863
00:32:54.311 --> 00:32:55.351
Guess what?

864
00:32:55.351 --> 00:32:57.873
If you are feeling any sort of negative emotion,

865
00:32:57.873 --> 00:32:59.667
there is a big fat lie present.

866
00:32:59.667 --> 00:33:03.229
Your inner critic is present, she or he is beating you up

867
00:33:03.229 --> 00:33:04.633
in that moment.

868
00:33:04.633 --> 00:33:07.597
When we resist it, it persists.

869
00:33:07.597 --> 00:33:11.341
It's so important, step one, to just bring all of those

870
00:33:11.341 --> 00:33:13.629
lies out of the darkness and into the light

871
00:33:13.629 --> 00:33:15.293
so they can be healed.

872
00:33:15.293 --> 00:33:18.205
Step one, what is my inner mean girl saying?

873
00:33:18.205 --> 00:33:19.791
What is my inner critic saying?

874
00:33:19.791 --> 00:33:21.299
Then step two is,

875
00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:23.561
I always encourage people to close their eyes,

876
00:33:23.561 --> 00:33:26.577
take a deep breath, get quiet, and say,

877
00:33:26.577 --> 00:33:28.995
"What does my inner wisdom know?"

878
00:33:28.995 --> 00:33:31.101
I've asked that question to my clients.

879
00:33:31.101 --> 00:33:33.623
What does your inner wisdom know?

880
00:33:33.623 --> 00:33:37.133
Thousands of times over the last 11 years of coaching.

881
00:33:37.133 --> 00:33:39.733
I've gotta tell you,

882
00:33:39.733 --> 00:33:43.217
amazing phenomenal fall off my chair things

883
00:33:43.217 --> 00:33:44.621
that our inner wisdom knows.

884
00:33:44.621 --> 00:33:46.233
When we just get quiet enough because we're

885
00:33:46.233 --> 00:33:49.327
our own best coach, we really are our own best

886
00:33:49.327 --> 00:33:51.069
mentor, we're our own best coach.

887
00:33:51.069 --> 00:33:54.657
I am all for people feeling really empowered

888
00:33:54.657 --> 00:33:55.931
around this.

889
00:33:55.931 --> 00:33:59.051
So really getting in tune with your inner wisdom

890
00:33:59.051 --> 00:34:03.107
is so incredibly powerful.

891
00:34:03.107 --> 00:34:04.927
Just getting quiet enough, and this is a thing

892
00:34:04.927 --> 00:34:07.267
that's really missing in Western culture,

893
00:34:07.267 --> 00:34:10.335
getting quiet enough to hear that inner wisdom.

894
00:34:11.455 --> 00:34:14.532
<v Voiceover>What's coming up, I'm thinking about this,</v>

895
00:34:14.532 --> 00:34:18.796
once you free these emotions that are sitting in the

896
00:34:18.796 --> 00:34:22.904
background running on your operating system anyway,

897
00:34:22.904 --> 00:34:26.934
unconsciously or consciously, once you free them, does that

898
00:34:26.934 --> 00:34:31.380
exact same process of freeing that take a certain amount

899
00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:34.162
of pressure off the psyche that allows the wisdom

900
00:34:34.162 --> 00:34:35.306
to actually come in?

901
00:34:35.306 --> 00:34:36.762
<v ->That's exactly right.</v>

902
00:34:36.762 --> 00:34:39.934
Beautifully put. Beautifully put.

903
00:34:39.934 --> 00:34:42.378
I always say to my clients, especially when I'm coaching

904
00:34:42.378 --> 00:34:45.056
them, I was on a show the other day

905
00:34:45.056 --> 00:34:48.722
and ran the actual host through the process.

906
00:34:48.722 --> 00:34:51.062
It was interesting and this is where having another

907
00:34:51.062 --> 00:34:53.090
person ask you these questions can be really

908
00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:54.806
really powerful and working in partnerships

909
00:34:54.806 --> 00:34:58.056
like I do on my teleclasses and workshops.

910
00:34:58.056 --> 00:35:00.318
Because I always say, "Wait for it."

911
00:35:00.318 --> 00:35:02.814
Because there'll be a pause, and they'll say,

912
00:35:02.814 --> 00:35:04.192
"That's pretty much what she's saying."

913
00:35:04.192 --> 00:35:06.886
And I go, "Mm-hm, what else?"

914
00:35:06.974 --> 00:35:10.370
And then it's like they really sink in.

915
00:35:10.406 --> 00:35:13.084
Oh wow, I'm not enough often will come out

916
00:35:13.084 --> 00:35:16.766
at the moment, or I'm totally failing.

917
00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:20.676
It's like peeling an onion and if you can really

918
00:35:20.676 --> 00:35:23.770
allow yourself to go through one to two pauses

919
00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:24.888
where you think, "I'm done,"

920
00:35:24.888 --> 00:35:26.032
you can do this writing as well.

921
00:35:26.032 --> 00:35:27.176
What's my inner mean girl saying to me?

922
00:35:27.176 --> 00:35:28.476
What's my inner critic saying to me?

923
00:35:28.476 --> 00:35:29.724
Write write write write write write write.

924
00:35:29.724 --> 00:35:33.718
You list 'em all out and then you'll be like, "Okay."

925
00:35:33.845 --> 00:35:35.639
And then ask again, "What else?"

926
00:35:36.554 --> 00:35:38.556
Actually she's really saying this to me.

927
00:35:38.556 --> 00:35:41.078
You get to those core foundational,

928
00:35:41.078 --> 00:35:43.678
like I call them in the book, motherlode lies,

929
00:35:43.678 --> 00:35:45.784
like I'm not enough or I'm unlovable,

930
00:35:45.784 --> 00:35:50.074
or I'm in this all alone, or I'm gonna end up homeless

931
00:35:50.074 --> 00:35:52.752
on the street corner because I'm failing.

932
00:35:52.752 --> 00:35:55.586
Whatever it is, really getting down to those cores.

933
00:35:55.586 --> 00:35:56.990
When you feel that sense of like,

934
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:59.122
okay, I'm at the bottom level here.

935
00:35:59.122 --> 00:36:01.462
That's a great place then to close your eyes and say,

936
00:36:01.462 --> 00:36:04.556
"And what is my inner wisdom now?"

937
00:36:04.556 --> 00:36:05.440
It's powerful.

938
00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.300
It really is just like

939
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.004
all of those lies come out of the darkness into the light

940
00:36:11.004 --> 00:36:13.136
and then they lose their power.

941
00:36:13.136 --> 00:36:14.826
<v Voiceover>They lose their power.</v>

942
00:36:14.826 --> 00:36:15.736
<v ->They lose their power.</v>

943
00:36:15.736 --> 00:36:17.816
<v Voiceover>Also in that emptying out, it allows</v>

944
00:36:17.816 --> 00:36:19.584
for the other voice to even come in.

945
00:36:19.584 --> 00:36:22.912
It's almost as though people have such a hard shell

946
00:36:22.912 --> 00:36:27.140
exterior protecting this story of who they think they are.

947
00:36:28.835 --> 00:36:32.241
Good bad or indifferent, just protecting a story.

948
00:36:32.241 --> 00:36:35.179
Rather than allowing their organic feelings to really

949
00:36:35.179 --> 00:36:37.441
flow through.

950
00:36:37.441 --> 00:36:38.637
<v ->Beautifully said.</v>

951
00:36:38.637 --> 00:36:40.873
<v Voiceover>I can see why</v>

952
00:36:40.873 --> 00:36:42.667
that process works so well.

953
00:36:42.667 --> 00:36:44.877
Even if it seems like, all right, I'm supposed

954
00:36:44.877 --> 00:36:46.437
to tell myself blah blah blah.

955
00:36:46.437 --> 00:36:50.025
But no, there's a lot of profundity behind all of this.

956
00:36:50.025 --> 00:36:51.195
<v ->Simple but powerful.</v>

957
00:36:51.195 --> 00:36:54.419
I'm all about simplicity because this three step process.

958
00:36:54.419 --> 00:36:56.395
So step one, what's my inner critic saying?

959
00:36:56.395 --> 00:36:57.955
Step two, what is my inner wisdom know?

960
00:36:57.955 --> 00:37:01.439
And step three, is to repeat out loud if possible

961
00:37:01.439 --> 00:37:03.675
what your inner wisdom said while doing some

962
00:37:03.675 --> 00:37:05.417
sort of physical gesture.

963
00:37:05.417 --> 00:37:07.211
<v Voiceover>It's almost like EFT or something.</v>

964
00:37:07.211 --> 00:37:09.473
<v ->It's a neurolinguistic programming technique, right?</v>

965
00:37:09.473 --> 00:37:11.215
For me, I tap on my heart, I have clients--

966
00:37:11.215 --> 00:37:13.581
one client that does this beautiful wave of her hand.

967
00:37:13.581 --> 00:37:15.323
I have other clients that kinda go like this.

968
00:37:15.323 --> 00:37:17.039
And you repeat it out loud and lock it in

969
00:37:17.039 --> 00:37:18.391
with that physical gesture.

970
00:37:18.391 --> 00:37:21.251
Then what you find is that you can actually just do that

971
00:37:21.251 --> 00:37:23.487
physical gesture and find your inner wisdom kinda

972
00:37:23.487 --> 00:37:25.359
coming through.

973
00:37:25.359 --> 00:37:27.049
So you're in the meeting and all of a sudden and you can

974
00:37:27.049 --> 00:37:29.701
just kinda look up a little bit and it's like shoop,

975
00:37:29.701 --> 00:37:32.015
your inner wisdom's right there.

976
00:37:32.015 --> 00:37:32.984
Those are the precepts.

977
00:37:32.984 --> 00:37:34.544
<v Voiceover>And there's been a lot of evidence on the</v>

978
00:37:34.544 --> 00:37:36.546
efficacy of EFT and all of this.

979
00:37:36.546 --> 00:37:38.470
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

980
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:40.108
<v Voiceover>So that's nice. So you lock it in.</v>

981
00:37:40.108 --> 00:37:42.448
<v ->Yeah, you lock it in with a physical gesture.</v>

982
00:37:42.448 --> 00:37:44.372
When I'm working with people or when I have them

983
00:37:44.372 --> 00:37:47.258
working in partners, what we do is we'll actually ask

984
00:37:47.258 --> 00:37:50.612
and I have the other person repeat back their inner wisdom

985
00:37:50.612 --> 00:37:52.276
and just say it to them.

986
00:37:52.276 --> 00:37:56.150
And I can't tell you how many women I've seen just sobbing

987
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:58.308
over hearing the truth.

988
00:37:58.308 --> 00:38:02.302
I was doing this with a client, the I'm unlovable lie.

989
00:38:02.338 --> 00:38:04.496
We'll talk about that for a minute.

990
00:38:04.496 --> 00:38:07.304
When we were doing this work together, we named her

991
00:38:07.304 --> 00:38:09.644
inner mean girl Loveless Lulu.

992
00:38:09.644 --> 00:38:12.010
Actually at Inner Mean Girl Reform School we have

993
00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:14.714
women draw their inner mean girls and draw

994
00:38:14.714 --> 00:38:18.068
their inner critics so they can really start getting that

995
00:38:18.068 --> 00:38:20.434
this is not the truth of who they are.

996
00:38:20.434 --> 00:38:22.540
<v Voiceover>I remember reading one, you have someone</v>

997
00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.984
who's just slovenly with cigarette hanging out

998
00:38:24.984 --> 00:38:25.972
of their lips.

999
00:38:25.972 --> 00:38:28.078
<v ->That's right, so it's Loveless Lulu, right?</v>

1000
00:38:28.078 --> 00:38:30.080
She has a cigarette in one hand and martini

1001
00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.290
in the other and she's like, "You'll never be loved, kid."

1002
00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:35.228
It's this real, can you just see her?

1003
00:38:35.228 --> 00:38:37.464
When Loveless Lulu was in the driver's seat,

1004
00:38:37.464 --> 00:38:39.258
what did this client of mine do?

1005
00:38:39.258 --> 00:38:42.014
Attracted all the guys to prove that she was unlovable.

1006
00:38:42.014 --> 00:38:43.210
The guys that weren't available.

1007
00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:44.406
The guys that were married.

1008
00:38:44.406 --> 00:38:47.604
The guys that would say one thing and then do another.

1009
00:38:47.604 --> 00:38:50.074
She just, when Loveless Lulu chose her dates,

1010
00:38:50.074 --> 00:38:51.764
she was not going out with anybody that was ever

1011
00:38:51.764 --> 00:38:54.728
going to show her love.

1012
00:38:54.728 --> 00:38:57.250
During that process, we really uncovered,

1013
00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:59.278
okay, what is my inner wisdom now?

1014
00:38:59.278 --> 00:39:02.164
Of course, your inner wisdom knows that you're lovable.

1015
00:39:02.164 --> 00:39:04.088
We can go even beyond that and really say,

1016
00:39:04.088 --> 00:39:05.960
"What else does my inner wisdom know?"

1017
00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.858
My inner wisdom knows that it's time for me

1018
00:39:07.858 --> 00:39:10.224
to stop dating unavailable men.

1019
00:39:10.224 --> 00:39:13.240
Your inner wisdom can throw down, as I like to say,

1020
00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.606
hardcore truths with you.

1021
00:39:15.606 --> 00:39:18.206
It's not just about, you're amazing,

1022
00:39:18.206 --> 00:39:19.376
these fluffy things.

1023
00:39:19.376 --> 00:39:21.768
When we get quiet enough, our inner wisdom

1024
00:39:21.768 --> 00:39:24.966
might also say, "Get out of the relationship, honey."

1025
00:39:24.966 --> 00:39:27.722
It might also say, "Put down the cookie,

1026
00:39:27.722 --> 00:39:29.178
"you've had enough."

1027
00:39:29.178 --> 00:39:30.660
Whatever the case may be.

1028
00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.558
Our inner wisdom will really say these things,

1029
00:39:32.558 --> 00:39:34.924
but they'll say it with compassion and love,

1030
00:39:34.924 --> 00:39:36.380
whereas our inner mean girl might say the exact

1031
00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.564
same thing but it's shaming, it's judgmental,

1032
00:39:38.564 --> 00:39:40.072
and it feels terrible.

1033
00:39:40.072 --> 00:39:43.452
But our inner wisdom speaks to us, it's this space of truth

1034
00:39:43.452 --> 00:39:45.350
and groundedness.

1035
00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:47.482
With this client, as she started really working

1036
00:39:47.482 --> 00:39:50.394
with her inner wisdom and listening to her intuition,

1037
00:39:50.394 --> 00:39:52.058
is that, "Should I date that guy,

1038
00:39:52.058 --> 00:39:53.306
"should I not date that guy?"

1039
00:39:53.306 --> 00:39:56.686
Oh, lemme really reframe who I'm being in this moment.

1040
00:39:56.686 --> 00:40:00.222
If I really believed I'm lovable, how would I show up?

1041
00:40:00.222 --> 00:40:01.834
Really started doing a lot of mirror work

1042
00:40:01.834 --> 00:40:04.850
with herself, with saying in the mirror, "I am lovable."

1043
00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:06.150
Love doing visualizations.

1044
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:08.048
This is one of the ones in the book with the I'm lovable

1045
00:40:08.048 --> 00:40:11.657
is imagine sitting across from yourself.

1046
00:40:12.395 --> 00:40:13.825
Just closing your eyes and imagine sitting

1047
00:40:13.825 --> 00:40:15.255
across from yourself.

1048
00:40:15.255 --> 00:40:17.257
And just looking into your own eyes,

1049
00:40:17.257 --> 00:40:20.585
and saying, "Sweetie, I see the disappointments,

1050
00:40:20.585 --> 00:40:22.483
"I see the things that haven't work out,

1051
00:40:22.483 --> 00:40:25.291
"and let's celebrate for a moment the wins.

1052
00:40:25.291 --> 00:40:27.371
"You are lovable."

1053
00:40:27.371 --> 00:40:30.023
Just starting to really say that to youself.

1054
00:40:30.023 --> 00:40:32.883
Saying it to yourself. 40 days.

1055
00:40:32.883 --> 00:40:34.157
See what happens.

1056
00:40:34.157 --> 00:40:36.809
This client of mine within a year was married.

1057
00:40:36.809 --> 00:40:38.785
Not only married to a great guy by the way,

1058
00:40:38.785 --> 00:40:40.683
not only married but she actually got married on

1059
00:40:40.683 --> 00:40:41.723
a television show.

1060
00:40:41.723 --> 00:40:44.661
On one of those E! shows of all things.

1061
00:40:44.661 --> 00:40:46.143
<v Voiceover>She really was lovable in front of the</v>

1062
00:40:46.143 --> 00:40:47.053
whole world.

1063
00:40:47.053 --> 00:40:47.781
<v ->That's right.</v>

1064
00:40:47.781 --> 00:40:49.809
She was fully lovable in front of the whole world.

1065
00:40:49.809 --> 00:40:51.239
<v Voiceover>There is so many ways that that wisdom</v>

1066
00:40:51.239 --> 00:40:53.735
part can show up, and I know that for many years what

1067
00:40:53.735 --> 00:40:55.893
I would do is just go to eagle's view

1068
00:40:55.893 --> 00:40:59.767
and I would watch myself and the other person or people

1069
00:40:59.767 --> 00:41:02.627
or situation almost just watching from above

1070
00:41:02.627 --> 00:41:04.707
almost like a chessboard where you're just seeing

1071
00:41:04.707 --> 00:41:07.853
everyone's just kind of maneuvering to and fro--

1072
00:41:07.853 --> 00:41:08.971
<v ->Beautiful.</v>

1073
00:41:08.971 --> 00:41:10.453
<v Voiceover>And they're either backtracking</v>

1074
00:41:10.453 --> 00:41:12.845
or they're moving forward, and no judgment.

1075
00:41:12.845 --> 00:41:15.341
And just watch myself as a detached observer

1076
00:41:15.341 --> 00:41:17.525
and my own reactions with that compassion.

1077
00:41:17.525 --> 00:41:18.409
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1078
00:41:18.409 --> 00:41:20.333
<v Voiceover>That was just a little way that worked for me.</v>

1079
00:41:20.333 --> 00:41:22.725
The point is that wisdom is there in every human being--

1080
00:41:22.725 --> 00:41:23.427
<v ->Everyone.</v>

1081
00:41:23.427 --> 00:41:24.363
<v Voiceover>And will show itself to you</v>

1082
00:41:24.363 --> 00:41:25.247
how you need it to.

1083
00:41:25.247 --> 00:41:26.027
<v ->That's right.</v>

1084
00:41:26.027 --> 00:41:28.653
That's one of the reasons I really advocate for

1085
00:41:28.653 --> 00:41:31.175
a daily practice.

1086
00:41:31.175 --> 00:41:33.099
One of the big fat lies that I have in the book,

1087
00:41:33.099 --> 00:41:34.919
I have kind of different sections in the book

1088
00:41:34.919 --> 00:41:36.453
and I have big fat lies about spirit.

1089
00:41:36.453 --> 00:41:38.897
And one of the ones in that section is

1090
00:41:38.897 --> 00:41:40.847
I don't need a spiritual practice.

1091
00:41:40.847 --> 00:41:42.355
I think that's complete BS--

1092
00:41:42.355 --> 00:41:43.603
<v Voiceover>I agree.</v>

1093
00:41:43.603 --> 00:41:44.981
<v ->And I'm sure the majority of the people</v>

1094
00:41:44.981 --> 00:41:47.087
watching this right now have some sort of

1095
00:41:47.087 --> 00:41:51.299
spiritual practice, and I really encourage a daily

1096
00:41:51.299 --> 00:41:54.003
spiritual practice, and I encourage you to find one

1097
00:41:54.003 --> 00:41:55.173
that works for you.

1098
00:41:55.173 --> 00:41:57.513
It does not need to mean that you're on a cushion

1099
00:41:57.513 --> 00:41:59.073
meditating for an hour.

1100
00:41:59.073 --> 00:42:01.387
I know very few people that have time in their lives

1101
00:42:01.387 --> 00:42:04.273
to meditate for 60 minutes in silence.

1102
00:42:04.273 --> 00:42:05.417
Really creating something.

1103
00:42:05.417 --> 00:42:07.497
For some of my clients it's dancing to their favorite

1104
00:42:07.497 --> 00:42:10.279
song in the morning, for others it's taking a gratitude walk

1105
00:42:10.279 --> 00:42:11.397
in nature.

1106
00:42:11.397 --> 00:42:13.607
That's where they feel connected to their spirit.

1107
00:42:13.607 --> 00:42:15.505
Whatever works for you,

1108
00:42:15.505 --> 00:42:18.079
and doing it on a daily basis so that you're

1109
00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:21.251
nurturing the relationship with your inner wisdom.

1110
00:42:21.251 --> 00:42:22.135
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

1111
00:42:22.135 --> 00:42:22.889
<v ->So important.</v>

1112
00:42:22.889 --> 00:42:24.995
<v Voiceover>There we've talked about three,</v>

1113
00:42:24.995 --> 00:42:27.049
that means there are 56 other lies in this book

1114
00:42:27.049 --> 00:42:29.545
and we can't get around to the other 56 right now.

1115
00:42:29.545 --> 00:42:31.677
People have to pick up a copy.

1116
00:42:31.677 --> 00:42:33.315
Also, tell us a little bit about the

1117
00:42:33.315 --> 00:42:36.877
Inner Mean Girl Reform School site.

1118
00:42:36.877 --> 00:42:38.515
What's that all about?

1119
00:42:38.515 --> 00:42:40.569
<v ->Inner Mean Girl Reform School, I founded it</v>

1120
00:42:40.569 --> 00:42:42.805
with Christine Arylo, who is the author of

1121
00:42:42.805 --> 00:42:47.017
"Choosing Me Before We," an amazing book.

1122
00:42:47.017 --> 00:42:49.357
We really got together and decided that there was

1123
00:42:49.357 --> 00:42:52.295
so much that we had in common about our message.

1124
00:42:52.295 --> 00:42:54.557
About women stopping being hard on themselves.

1125
00:42:54.557 --> 00:42:57.495
About women starting to really love themselves.

1126
00:42:57.495 --> 00:42:59.679
We came up with this term the inner mean girl

1127
00:42:59.679 --> 00:43:02.539
together on a hike actually one day.

1128
00:43:02.539 --> 00:43:04.125
We were like, it is, it's like the mean girls

1129
00:43:04.125 --> 00:43:05.035
in the hallways.

1130
00:43:05.035 --> 00:43:07.193
I always described my inner critic as she's like

1131
00:43:07.193 --> 00:43:09.819
a seventh grader that decides not to speak to me

1132
00:43:09.819 --> 00:43:10.885
one day.

1133
00:43:10.885 --> 00:43:13.693
It's really brutal, all of this stuff that--

1134
00:43:13.693 --> 00:43:15.981
brutality that goes in junior high.

1135
00:43:15.981 --> 00:43:17.983
That's what I was dealing with on a daily basis

1136
00:43:17.983 --> 00:43:20.661
inside my head before I did all these tools that I teach

1137
00:43:20.661 --> 00:43:22.013
people.

1138
00:43:22.013 --> 00:43:23.755
Again, she still shows up but I know how to work

1139
00:43:23.755 --> 00:43:24.951
with her now.

1140
00:43:24.951 --> 00:43:26.927
And so we came up with Inner Mean Girl Reform School

1141
00:43:26.927 --> 00:43:30.541
and it's a 10 step process that we take women through.

1142
00:43:30.541 --> 00:43:33.323
We have live classes every once in a while.

1143
00:43:33.323 --> 00:43:35.247
We also have a home study kit.

1144
00:43:35.247 --> 00:43:37.431
We've had hundreds of women go through this school

1145
00:43:37.431 --> 00:43:39.953
with phenomenal results.

1146
00:43:39.953 --> 00:43:41.747
Women that are starting to really lead

1147
00:43:41.747 --> 00:43:43.775
with their inner wisdom.

1148
00:43:43.775 --> 00:43:45.543
When that shows up, we've had women get out of

1149
00:43:45.543 --> 00:43:47.753
relationships, attract relationships, improve their

1150
00:43:47.753 --> 00:43:50.613
marriages, we had a woman lose 25 pounds as an act

1151
00:43:50.613 --> 00:43:52.745
of self-love.

1152
00:43:52.745 --> 00:43:55.033
We have women who start new careers.

1153
00:43:55.033 --> 00:43:57.087
We have women who end careers.

1154
00:43:57.087 --> 00:44:00.493
Whatever it is really coming from that inner wisdom.

1155
00:44:00.493 --> 00:44:03.769
And it's so inspiring.

1156
00:44:03.769 --> 00:44:06.317
It's incredibly inspiring and I feel so blessed

1157
00:44:06.317 --> 00:44:09.151
that I get to do that and lead that work.

1158
00:44:09.151 --> 00:44:11.231
It's really a phenomenal 10 step process.

1159
00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:12.219
<v Voiceover>That sounds great.</v>

1160
00:44:12.219 --> 00:44:15.521
Sounds like you're busy, and you are doing enough.

1161
00:44:15.521 --> 00:44:16.379
(laughs)

1162
00:44:16.379 --> 00:44:17.289
<v ->Right, thank you!</v>

1163
00:44:17.289 --> 00:44:18.823
<v Voiceover>And Stuart Smalley looking in the mirror</v>

1164
00:44:18.823 --> 00:44:20.721
and saying, "I am enough, I am lovable."

1165
00:44:20.721 --> 00:44:22.411
<v ->I know, and, "Gosh darn it, people like me."</v>

1166
00:44:22.411 --> 00:44:23.945
(laughs)

1167
00:44:23.945 --> 00:44:24.595
Exactly.

1168
00:44:24.595 --> 00:44:25.687
<v Voiceover>But you are doing it.</v>

1169
00:44:25.687 --> 00:44:27.117
You're doing the real work.

1170
00:44:27.117 --> 00:44:27.897
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1171
00:44:27.897 --> 00:44:30.906
<v Voiceover>Is there anything else before we go here</v>

1172
00:44:30.906 --> 00:44:33.272
that I haven't thought to ask you yet

1173
00:44:33.272 --> 00:44:35.534
regarding the book or the site or

1174
00:44:35.534 --> 00:44:39.164
any further insights you'd like to share?

1175
00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:40.812
<v ->Great question.</v>

1176
00:44:40.812 --> 00:44:43.152
I think that I would just like to say, for

1177
00:44:43.152 --> 00:44:46.350
everybody that's watching, that you are lovable,

1178
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:50.068
that you are enough, and that you are doing enough.

1179
00:44:50.068 --> 00:44:52.895
If I could give people just one tip, one takeaway

1180
00:44:52.895 --> 00:44:56.015
from this, it would be that you're not alone.

1181
00:44:56.015 --> 00:44:57.081
That you're not the only one that's being hard

1182
00:44:57.081 --> 00:44:59.837
on yourself, and that there is another way of being.

1183
00:44:59.837 --> 00:45:03.191
Just to tune into your inner wisdom on a daily basis

1184
00:45:03.191 --> 00:45:04.205
will change your life.

1185
00:45:04.205 --> 00:45:06.025
It's changed my life and it's changed hundreds

1186
00:45:06.025 --> 00:45:07.455
of other women's lives too.

1187
00:45:07.455 --> 00:45:09.249
<v Voiceover>Absolutely, and if virtually every</v>

1188
00:45:09.249 --> 00:45:11.537
other woman's doing it, then there's something wrong

1189
00:45:11.537 --> 00:45:13.435
with the larger picture, not you.

1190
00:45:13.435 --> 00:45:14.735
<v ->Yeah, that's right.</v>

1191
00:45:14.735 --> 00:45:15.749
<v Voiceover>Very good.</v>

1192
00:45:15.749 --> 00:45:16.789
Thank you so much for your time.

1193
00:45:16.789 --> 00:45:18.833
<v ->Thank you. Thank you so much.</v>

1194
00:45:20.897 --> 00:45:22.639
<v ->It appears that it all comes down to how we</v>

1195
00:45:22.639 --> 00:45:24.953
raise our daughters from here forward.

1196
00:45:24.953 --> 00:45:27.085
If you too are hard on yourself, you can begin to

1197
00:45:27.085 --> 00:45:29.529
break the cycle of negative beliefs by checking into

1198
00:45:29.529 --> 00:45:33.013
Amy's work at bigfatliesbook.com.

1199
00:45:33.013 --> 00:45:35.379
She does workshops as well if you'd like to have

1200
00:45:35.379 --> 00:45:36.705
a more hands on experience.

1201
00:45:36.705 --> 00:45:40.127
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
