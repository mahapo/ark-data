00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:03.111
ï»¿- Whenever I need to know the inside scoop on any kind

2
00:00:03.111 --> 00:00:05.871
of new healing technique or medical advancement

3
00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:09.431
I turn to Dr. James Hutton, the man you're about to meet.

4
00:00:09.431 --> 00:00:11.471
He's a medical doctor and naturopath

5
00:00:11.471 --> 00:00:13.511
and has an insatiable appetite

6
00:00:13.511 --> 00:00:15.711
for cutting edge healing modalities.

7
00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:17.471
In this interview, we speak about

8
00:00:17.471 --> 00:00:20.171
some little known therapies such as ultraviolet,

9
00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:22.411
ozone and hydrogen peroxide,

10
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:24.451
and diseases ranging from bird flu

11
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:27.291
and hepatitis C to vaccines.

12
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:30.901 line:15% 
(ambient music)

13
00:00:35.192 --> 00:00:36.732
So, James, in your practice you offer

14
00:00:36.732 --> 00:00:39.152
a whole new bag of tricks for people, many, new;

15
00:00:39.152 --> 00:00:41.792
ultraviolet, ozone, peroxide, things that most of us

16
00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:44.733
have not heard of and when we go to our doctor.

17
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.013
<v ->Right.</v>

18
00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:47.873
<v Voiceover>All of this is essential because,</v>

19
00:00:47.873 --> 00:00:50.773
en masse, we seem to be having a huge breakdown

20
00:00:50.773 --> 00:00:51.893
in our immune systems.

21
00:00:51.893 --> 00:00:53.553
Can you just talk about some of the factors

22
00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.213
as to what's happening to us?

23
00:00:55.213 --> 00:00:57.174
<v ->Surely, no problem.</v>

24
00:00:57.174 --> 00:00:59.534
One of the main factors that I feel has taken place

25
00:00:59.534 --> 00:01:04.534
is that we've had an onslaught with ionizing radiation.

26
00:01:05.154 --> 00:01:07.835
Those of us that were born,

27
00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:11.415
say just prior to World War II, or around World War II

28
00:01:11.415 --> 00:01:13.755
with the beginning of the nuclear age,

29
00:01:13.755 --> 00:01:15.955
there's a book written called "Deadly Deceit"

30
00:01:15.955 --> 00:01:18.415
and I've forgotten the author's name at the moment,

31
00:01:18.415 --> 00:01:20.275
but nonetheless the book is "Deadly Deceit".

32
00:01:20.275 --> 00:01:21.935
And the author who wrote the book, I was fortunate

33
00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:23.375
to be able to spend some time with him

34
00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:25.295
at a conference number of years ago.

35
00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:26.535
And what he found was that

36
00:01:26.535 --> 00:01:29.015
there is no safe level of radiation.

37
00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:31.535
And that he correlated, unequivocally,

38
00:01:31.535 --> 00:01:35.635
over a 20-some odd year period of nuclear blast:

39
00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:37.515
the above ground and below ground blast,

40
00:01:37.515 --> 00:01:40.515
so the blast in general, as well as nuclear power plants

41
00:01:40.515 --> 00:01:42.635
with respect to infant mortality

42
00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.155
and the elderlies mortality.

43
00:01:44.155 --> 00:01:47.535
He literally plotted when you had high incidences

44
00:01:47.535 --> 00:01:50.955
or years where they had done nuclear blasts,

45
00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:53.275
you had high infant and elderly mortality

46
00:01:53.275 --> 00:01:55.655
from the destruction of the immune system.

47
00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:58.995
You add in with this the electromagnetic radiation,

48
00:01:58.995 --> 00:02:01.555
i.e. cellphones, microwave towers.

49
00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:05.535
We have now far more electromagnetics

50
00:02:05.535 --> 00:02:08.635
bombarding us on a daily, actually minute by minute moment

51
00:02:08.635 --> 00:02:11.115
than in any history on the planet of time

52
00:02:11.115 --> 00:02:14.697
and this again destroys immune function.

53
00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:15.837
I don't mean to sound gloom and doom

54
00:02:15.837 --> 00:02:20.678
but then you bring in to facts the 10,000 plus chemicals

55
00:02:20.678 --> 00:02:23.258
that have been put into our environment

56
00:02:23.258 --> 00:02:25.898
since the advent of chemical synthesis.

57
00:02:25.898 --> 00:02:30.269
1937 is approximate date of when we began synthesizing

58
00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.059
different organics with petroleum chemistry.

59
00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:38.479
Now the other flipside of this is that we are looking at,

60
00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:41.999
I'll just say pollution of the planet

61
00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.179
with petroleum chemistry.

62
00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:47.219
There's a book written, "Our Stolen Future",

63
00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:48.360
that documents for example--

64
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.180
<v Voiceover>Our Stolen Future?</v>

65
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.381
<v ->Our Stolen Future.</v>

66
00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:51.581
The authors I have the hardest time,

67
00:02:51.581 --> 00:02:52.961
it's about six authors but--

68
00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:54.341
<v Voiceover>But you remember the name that's good,</v>

69
00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:55.021
the name of the book.

70
00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:56.584
<v ->Yes.</v>

71
00:02:56.584 --> 00:03:00.926
This book has about 300 authors and references.

72
00:03:00.926 --> 00:03:03.686
It is probably one of the best referenced

73
00:03:03.686 --> 00:03:07.986
or annotated documentaries of a direct causal link

74
00:03:07.986 --> 00:03:10.526
between petroleum chemistry and cancer.

75
00:03:10.526 --> 00:03:15.026
And it has gotten airplay publicly for the obvious reason,

76
00:03:15.026 --> 00:03:16.386
no one will touch it.

77
00:03:16.386 --> 00:03:20.706
But I bring this up because the pharmaceutical industry

78
00:03:20.706 --> 00:03:24.466
is basically a manipulation of petroleum chemistry

79
00:03:24.466 --> 00:03:29.126
that began synthesizing plant active constituents in '37.

80
00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:30.686
I won't go into the politics of it,

81
00:03:30.686 --> 00:03:33.806
but it's very literal and true.

82
00:03:33.806 --> 00:03:36.046
There's a book called "Our Divided Legacy"

83
00:03:36.046 --> 00:03:40.486
by the author Harris Coulter and it documents the funding

84
00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:43.368
by J.D. Rockefeller, kinda old man Rockefeller,

85
00:03:43.368 --> 00:03:48.189
of pushing the pharmaceutical industry because of the,

86
00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.089
excuse me, the petroleum industry that Rockefeller's own,

87
00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:52.149
Standard Oil.

88
00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:54.231
Everything red, white and blue the Rockefeller's own

89
00:03:54.231 --> 00:03:55.331
as far oil.

90
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:57.271
<v Voiceover>Right, and how was this related,</v>

91
00:03:57.271 --> 00:03:59.671
again back to the pharmaceutical industry?

92
00:03:59.671 --> 00:04:02.631
<v ->Because all of the pharmaceuticals that are made</v>

93
00:04:02.631 --> 00:04:06.981
are a manipulation with organic chemistry of petroleum.

94
00:04:13.251 --> 00:04:15.391
In many instances it's very difficult to find someone

95
00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:18.551
to testify in a multiple chemical sensitivity

96
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:21.551
or an environmental sensitive patients' behalf,

97
00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:22.691
because this goes against

98
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:25.511
the pharmaceutical/petroleum industry.

99
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:26.632
That's my opinion.

100
00:04:26.632 --> 00:04:29.712
It's relatively obvious but it's an opinion as well.

101
00:04:29.712 --> 00:04:31.712
Now I bring all this up because these things

102
00:04:31.712 --> 00:04:33.312
tax the immune system.

103
00:04:33.312 --> 00:04:35.252
The dimension of petroleum chemistry,

104
00:04:35.252 --> 00:04:38.032
we have 10,000 chemicals in the environment

105
00:04:38.032 --> 00:04:40.992
that were not here prior to the '40s.

106
00:04:40.992 --> 00:04:43.972
And the body was never meant to deal with those.

107
00:04:43.972 --> 00:04:47.873
The liver does the detoxification as we all well know

108
00:04:47.873 --> 00:04:51.053
and it makes things water soluble, to say it simply,

109
00:04:51.053 --> 00:04:54.353
and then the kidneys excrete that water soluble toxin.

110
00:04:55.614 --> 00:04:57.254
These 10,000 chemicals, we weren't designed

111
00:04:57.254 --> 00:04:59.374
to deal with them, to put it simply.

112
00:04:59.374 --> 00:05:01.434
And so from these factors,

113
00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:03.574
you have a depressed immune system.

114
00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:06.414
That brings us to the next step of vaccines

115
00:05:06.414 --> 00:05:10.635
and bacteriology or microbiology and viruses, et cetera.

116
00:05:10.635 --> 00:05:13.015
When you have such a decrease with the immune system,

117
00:05:13.015 --> 00:05:15.695
just simple logic dictates that one would be susceptible

118
00:05:15.695 --> 00:05:17.135
to any and everything.

119
00:05:17.135 --> 00:05:20.535
And as a physician, I'm seeing that.

120
00:05:20.535 --> 00:05:25.535
I see young people, 12, 13, 15 years of age,

121
00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:29.015
that you would see them you wouldn't expect them

122
00:05:29.015 --> 00:05:31.215
to have the type of physical conditions,

123
00:05:31.215 --> 00:05:34.795
I'm not saying deadly viruses, I don't meant it that way,

124
00:05:34.795 --> 00:05:38.115
but their bodies are not strong, they're not healthy.

125
00:05:38.115 --> 00:05:42.975
I mean, I use the analogy of say my generation

126
00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:45.735
and then the prior generations previous to that

127
00:05:45.735 --> 00:05:46.975
seem to be much healthier.

128
00:05:46.975 --> 00:05:50.755
I mean, I've seen 14, 15-year-olds that were just

129
00:05:50.755 --> 00:05:54.336
in not good physical shape and they should be for their age.

130
00:05:54.336 --> 00:05:55.337
<v Voiceover>And that you have stories of</v>

131
00:05:55.337 --> 00:05:57.857
95-year-old grandma drinking her bourbon

132
00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:59.717
and smoking cigarettes and cigars

133
00:05:59.717 --> 00:06:01.157
to her dying day, no problem.

134
00:06:01.157 --> 00:06:03.837
<v ->Right, because of the strong constitution.</v>

135
00:06:03.837 --> 00:06:04.737
Big difference.

136
00:06:04.737 --> 00:06:05.837
<v Voiceover>Big difference 'cause you spent</v>

137
00:06:05.837 --> 00:06:07.137
the early formative years of her life

138
00:06:07.137 --> 00:06:09.477
without those chemical pollutants, for one thing.

139
00:06:09.477 --> 00:06:11.277
<v ->Yes, I think that's the case, I do.</v>

140
00:06:11.277 --> 00:06:13.617
<v Voiceover>And you're talking about the kids here.</v>

141
00:06:13.617 --> 00:06:15.277
I just wanna bring something up briefly.

142
00:06:15.277 --> 00:06:17.457
I don't know if you read about it.

143
00:06:17.457 --> 00:06:18.537
It was relatively recently

144
00:06:18.537 --> 00:06:21.257
that the Center for Disease Control is looking

145
00:06:21.257 --> 00:06:26.257
at giving vaccines to 11-year-old girls for cervical cancer.

146
00:06:26.397 --> 00:06:27.317
<v ->I heard this.</v>

147
00:06:27.317 --> 00:06:29.557
<v Voiceover>This was something really shocking to me,</v>

148
00:06:29.557 --> 00:06:30.177
to see this.

149
00:06:30.177 --> 00:06:32.477
Do you have any comment on this before we go back on

150
00:06:32.477 --> 00:06:34.677
to the main highway of the information here?

151
00:06:34.677 --> 00:06:36.687
<v ->Yes, I would love to comment on this.</v>

152
00:06:38.577 --> 00:06:41.637
There've been several books written about vaccinations.

153
00:06:41.637 --> 00:06:44.117
Now they're not about this specific vaccine

154
00:06:44.117 --> 00:06:45.477
but I would like to document.

155
00:06:45.477 --> 00:06:49.937
One book is "A Shot in the Dark", again Harris Coulter,

156
00:06:49.937 --> 00:06:53.328
it's about the DPT vaccine.

157
00:06:54.658 --> 00:06:58.478
And there's one called "Doctor, is this Shot Safe",

158
00:06:58.478 --> 00:06:59.738
I don't remember the author of it

159
00:06:59.738 --> 00:07:01.778
but it's another one about vaccines.

160
00:07:01.778 --> 00:07:06.778
My basic objection to vaccines, with anyone,

161
00:07:07.278 --> 00:07:12.278
is that the FDA allows 100 viral contaminants per dose,

162
00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:16.539
that can be 100 viral particles of the same virus,

163
00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:18.999
none of which are the organism you're being

164
00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:22.110
vaccinated with and against the illness.

165
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.960
It could be 100 viral particles of different viruses, okay?

166
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.880
Now when you take it--

167
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.040
<v Voiceover>It's giving us a lot of leeway</v>

168
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.380
to toy with this stuff.

169
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.400
<v ->It does.</v>

170
00:07:33.481 --> 00:07:35.301
We're not discussing the possibilities

171
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:39.721
of creative additions, we'll say to these,

172
00:07:39.721 --> 00:07:42.461
which we know that has happened in the past, verifiably.

173
00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:46.761
I'll just quote one example, is the SV40 virus

174
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:50.861
that was the polio vaccine, when we were children,

175
00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:52.261
the sugar cube.

176
00:07:52.261 --> 00:07:55.322
They found that that vaccine was contaminated

177
00:07:55.322 --> 00:07:56.941
and laced with SV40.

178
00:07:56.941 --> 00:07:59.981
I wanna ask you if you don't mind,

179
00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:02.041
have you ever heard the term SV40

180
00:08:02.041 --> 00:08:03.163
and do you know what it stands for?

181
00:08:03.163 --> 00:08:04.203
<v Voiceover>No, I haven't.</v>

182
00:08:04.203 --> 00:08:07.603
<v ->Okay, it stands for Simian Virus number 40.</v>

183
00:08:07.603 --> 00:08:11.323
It was the 40th virus back in the '60s that they found

184
00:08:11.323 --> 00:08:14.083
had contaminated our vaccine cultures.

185
00:08:14.083 --> 00:08:15.703
The 40th.

186
00:08:15.703 --> 00:08:16.264
<v Voiceover>Oh my gosh.</v>

187
00:08:16.264 --> 00:08:17.324
<v ->The 40th, okay.</v>

188
00:08:17.324 --> 00:08:21.404
Now, to me that's a big issue.

189
00:08:21.404 --> 00:08:22.264
That's a very big issue.

190
00:08:22.264 --> 00:08:24.464
Now the one thing I'd like to add in here,

191
00:08:24.464 --> 00:08:27.064
I don't agree with vaccines at all.

192
00:08:27.064 --> 00:08:29.504
I think that's pretty obvious at this point.

193
00:08:29.504 --> 00:08:30.764
<v Voiceover>Because of the contaminants--</v>

194
00:08:30.764 --> 00:08:31.405
<v ->That's one.</v>

195
00:08:31.405 --> 00:08:32.206
<v Voiceover>That are contained within.</v>

196
00:08:32.206 --> 00:08:33.126
And what else?

197
00:08:33.126 --> 00:08:34.846
<v ->The fact that when Dr. Jenner,</v>

198
00:08:34.846 --> 00:08:37.046
who started the vaccine story:

199
00:08:37.046 --> 00:08:40.346
smallpox, chicken pox, the whole thing years ago,

200
00:08:40.346 --> 00:08:42.726
or cowpox, I should say, and small pox.

201
00:08:42.726 --> 00:08:46.026
On his deathbed so to speak, before then,

202
00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.806
but he realized that this was incorrect,

203
00:08:47.806 --> 00:08:49.326
that vaccines do not work,

204
00:08:49.326 --> 00:08:51.826
vaccines have never stopped a single epidemic.

205
00:08:51.826 --> 00:08:53.046
There are people who would disagree with that

206
00:08:53.046 --> 00:08:54.006
but that's a fact.

207
00:08:54.006 --> 00:08:57.666
That's an epidemiological fact as they say.

208
00:08:57.666 --> 00:09:00.886
The other reason I'm against them is this:

209
00:09:00.886 --> 00:09:02.966
we're all familiar with sudden infant death syndrome,

210
00:09:02.966 --> 00:09:05.586
a number of years ago that was the big story, okay.

211
00:09:05.586 --> 00:09:07.726
This is a very big eye opener.

212
00:09:07.726 --> 00:09:10.566
I've been wanting to get the hard copy proof of this,

213
00:09:10.566 --> 00:09:11.886
I just have not, but it is true.

214
00:09:11.886 --> 00:09:15.886
I have a colleague in Japan who verified this for me.

215
00:09:15.886 --> 00:09:20.886
Japan had the same sudden infant death ratio percentage

216
00:09:21.326 --> 00:09:23.686
with their children as we had.

217
00:09:23.686 --> 00:09:28.606
They decided to stop all vaccines, all vaccines on children

218
00:09:28.606 --> 00:09:30.626
from two years of age and under.

219
00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:32.166
No vaccines were given to children

220
00:09:32.166 --> 00:09:34.086
two years of age and under.

221
00:09:34.086 --> 00:09:38.646
The very first year, the first year they did this

222
00:09:38.646 --> 00:09:42.466
their sudden infant death syndrome rate went to zero.

223
00:09:42.466 --> 00:09:44.526
Now you don't have to be an epidemiologist

224
00:09:44.526 --> 00:09:45.706
to figure that one out.

225
00:09:45.706 --> 00:09:47.247
That's not rocket science as they say.

226
00:09:47.247 --> 00:09:48.307
<v Voiceover>Lorraine Day just talked to us</v>

227
00:09:48.307 --> 00:09:49.107
about the same thing.

228
00:09:49.107 --> 00:09:50.027
<v ->Okay, good, good.</v>

229
00:09:50.027 --> 00:09:51.267
<v Voiceover>Very true.</v>

230
00:09:51.267 --> 00:09:52.507
She didn't talk about the Japanese report.

231
00:09:52.507 --> 00:09:53.347
That's an interesting--

232
00:09:53.347 --> 00:09:54.447
<v ->That's the statistics.</v>

233
00:09:54.447 --> 00:09:56.647
That's where it came from.

234
00:09:56.647 --> 00:10:00.527
I applied for a job when I was in medical school,

235
00:10:00.527 --> 00:10:04.387
part-time, to do sleep studies in a SIDS unit,

236
00:10:04.387 --> 00:10:06.427
to do sleep studies on babies.

237
00:10:06.427 --> 00:10:08.427
When I talked to the nurse medical director

238
00:10:08.427 --> 00:10:10.667
of the department and gave her the statistic

239
00:10:10.667 --> 00:10:12.868
they would not hire me.

240
00:10:12.868 --> 00:10:13.688
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

241
00:10:13.688 --> 00:10:14.988
<v ->They would not hire me because they didn't want me</v>

242
00:10:14.988 --> 00:10:16.048
telling the parents.

243
00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:19.228
<v Voiceover>Right, that's useful information for a parent.</v>

244
00:10:19.228 --> 00:10:20.228
<v ->Oh yes.</v>

245
00:10:20.228 --> 00:10:24.048
Now to bring us back to the point of say bird flu

246
00:10:24.048 --> 00:10:25.368
and other viral problems.

247
00:10:25.368 --> 00:10:28.428
Now with children, like say the girls with the vaccine,

248
00:10:28.428 --> 00:10:29.788
they're being vaccinated against

249
00:10:29.788 --> 00:10:32.388
the human papillomavirus HPV.

250
00:10:33.488 --> 00:10:36.710
My concern would be, "What is this going to do to them?"

251
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.190
Because it's pretty apparent by now,

252
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.550
one of the aspects of vaccines that is not discussed

253
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.510
is that we tend to think that a vaccine

254
00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:50.430
destroys the immune system, that's the real trauma

255
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.970
or that is the attack on the body.

256
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.110
But in reality, the greater attack or the greater damage

257
00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.510
is done on the neurological system.

258
00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.850
The book "A Shot in the Dark" by Harris Coulter,

259
00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:05.850
specifically the DPT, to give you just a short gamut

260
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.810
or idea of what I'm speaking about.

261
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.310
In the book he discusses the fact

262
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.310
that when a child has been given the DPT, for example,

263
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.411
if that child say lightly when (mumbles) to shot

264
00:11:17.411 --> 00:11:20.212
and then over the next 24, 48 hours

265
00:11:20.212 --> 00:11:21.872
the child was just pretty normal,

266
00:11:21.872 --> 00:11:23.612
maybe a little bit uncomfortable but normal.

267
00:11:23.612 --> 00:11:27.332
Not a great deal of neurological insult has been done.

268
00:11:27.332 --> 00:11:29.512
However, the converse of that,

269
00:11:29.512 --> 00:11:31.752
the child that within an hour to an hour and a half

270
00:11:31.752 --> 00:11:35.012
after the injection begins to scream

271
00:11:35.012 --> 00:11:38.774
in an odd high-pitched scream unlike this child

272
00:11:38.774 --> 00:11:41.374
that the mother will tell you, "This is not my child."

273
00:11:41.374 --> 00:11:45.354
And many times they'll scream for 24 hours or longer,

274
00:11:45.354 --> 00:11:47.094
usually not more than 24 to 48,

275
00:11:47.094 --> 00:11:50.214
but it's been known for at least 12 to 24.

276
00:11:50.214 --> 00:11:54.614
And these children have had severe neurological insult.

277
00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:58.754
I'm trained in other areas in technical medical aspects,

278
00:11:58.754 --> 00:12:01.234
EEG or electroencephalograpy,

279
00:12:01.234 --> 00:12:04.754
and I've done EEGs on 3,000 babies and children.

280
00:12:04.754 --> 00:12:08.434
And I can have a mother hold a baby,

281
00:12:08.434 --> 00:12:09.894
say three to six months of age,

282
00:12:09.894 --> 00:12:12.054
that's been vaccinated behind me.

283
00:12:13.875 --> 00:12:15.175
I've done it in the grocery store.

284
00:12:15.175 --> 00:12:18.375
I can hear a child cry that's that age, under six months,

285
00:12:18.375 --> 00:12:20.635
and I can tell you they've been vaccinated.

286
00:12:22.156 --> 00:12:25.376
I've been in a hospital a long time and you can just tell.

287
00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:27.777
You can just feel it.

288
00:12:27.777 --> 00:12:31.717
It's a very weak constitutional energy behind it.

289
00:12:31.717 --> 00:12:33.537
<v Voiceover>Then what happens as time goes on</v>

290
00:12:33.537 --> 00:12:37.377
and they continue developing after having this assault,

291
00:12:37.377 --> 00:12:39.117
or this system so to speak?

292
00:12:39.117 --> 00:12:40.577
<v ->Well I think it's fairly obvious.</v>

293
00:12:40.577 --> 00:12:42.437
I can't correlate this or give you any proof.

294
00:12:42.437 --> 00:12:45.539
I think probably Dr. Doris Rapp,

295
00:12:45.539 --> 00:12:46.759
feels like mentioned the name,

296
00:12:46.759 --> 00:12:48.419
Dr. Rapp have discussed this numerous times.

297
00:12:48.419 --> 00:12:50.299
She's done a lot of toxicology with children.

298
00:12:50.299 --> 00:12:53.400
She feels that it's sort of similar and could confirm that

299
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.680
that it's the vaccine damage.

300
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.641
<v Voiceover>So do they develop neurologically differently</v>

301
00:12:58.641 --> 00:13:00.101
than they would have otherwise?

302
00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:01.961
What are some of the potentials with that?

303
00:13:01.961 --> 00:13:02.821
<v ->ADD.</v>

304
00:13:02.821 --> 00:13:04.261
<v Voiceover>ADD, okay, there you go.</v>

305
00:13:04.261 --> 00:13:06.381
<v ->The different behavioral, what we now.</v>

306
00:13:06.381 --> 00:13:09.341
I've had the fortune to talk to some teachers,

307
00:13:09.341 --> 00:13:11.562
older teachers that say taught through the late '50s

308
00:13:11.562 --> 00:13:14.402
and early '60s before the heavy vaccines were done,

309
00:13:14.402 --> 00:13:16.002
say the latter '70 and '80s.

310
00:13:16.002 --> 00:13:18.222
And they'll tell you, if they've gotten to teach

311
00:13:18.222 --> 00:13:20.702
a little bit in the latter years, they'll say,

312
00:13:20.702 --> 00:13:23.322
"We didn't have these type of behavioral problems

313
00:13:23.322 --> 00:13:24.363
"before all the vaccines."

314
00:13:24.363 --> 00:13:25.183
<v Voiceover>Autism?</v>

315
00:13:25.183 --> 00:13:26.504
<v ->Oh definitely not autism.</v>

316
00:13:26.504 --> 00:13:27.944
It wasn't common.

317
00:13:27.944 --> 00:13:30.584
Now it is possible and has happened

318
00:13:30.584 --> 00:13:33.504
that even though we were all given some vaccines

319
00:13:33.504 --> 00:13:35.784
some children still had the same problems,

320
00:13:35.784 --> 00:13:37.904
but not until the vaccines were given at earlier

321
00:13:37.904 --> 00:13:38.884
and earlier ages.

322
00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:41.204
That seems to be one of the major factors.

323
00:13:41.204 --> 00:13:43.604
<v Voiceover>Was there a prevalence of more</v>

324
00:13:43.604 --> 00:13:46.304
kind of super vaccines as times gone on

325
00:13:46.304 --> 00:13:48.504
or are they still more or less single strain,

326
00:13:48.504 --> 00:13:49.804
aside from the 100 contaminants?

327
00:13:49.804 --> 00:13:51.944
<v ->They seem to be single strain.</v>

328
00:13:55.065 --> 00:13:57.745
It seems to be more, the fact that the vaccines

329
00:13:57.745 --> 00:13:59.926
are being given earlier and earlier ages.

330
00:13:59.926 --> 00:14:02.306
But I think another compounding factor is the fact

331
00:14:02.306 --> 00:14:04.086
that they were giving numbers of vaccines.

332
00:14:04.086 --> 00:14:05.446
It's like in the military.

333
00:14:05.446 --> 00:14:06.207
There are many stories.

334
00:14:06.207 --> 00:14:08.607
We talked to some of either Vietnam vets

335
00:14:08.607 --> 00:14:10.667
and even some of the Gulf War type vets.

336
00:14:10.667 --> 00:14:12.787
There are times they'll give you so many vaccines

337
00:14:12.787 --> 00:14:13.507
at one time.

338
00:14:13.507 --> 00:14:15.447
I remember one friend of mine who was a Ranger he said,

339
00:14:15.447 --> 00:14:17.927
"They gave us vaccines, took us on a 10-mile forced march."

340
00:14:17.927 --> 00:14:19.927
He said, "Half of us dropped out in the ground."

341
00:14:19.927 --> 00:14:22.807
He said, "Your body can't tolerate that much."

342
00:14:22.807 --> 00:14:25.607
And it's just a severe onslaught.

343
00:14:25.607 --> 00:14:27.247
Many times these guys get sick for days.

344
00:14:27.247 --> 00:14:29.288
You don't hear about that sort of thing.

345
00:14:29.288 --> 00:14:32.088
<v Voiceover>So obviously, enforced vaccination,</v>

346
00:14:32.088 --> 00:14:33.799
mandatory vaccination.

347
00:14:36.469 --> 00:14:38.269
Since we're on the subject, let's just go there now

348
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:39.330
and we'll go on.

349
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.730
What does a parent do if they do not want

350
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.571
to have their child vaccinated when it's required

351
00:14:43.571 --> 00:14:45.451
in public and private schools?

352
00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:49.111
<v ->Right, in some states, I think,</v>

353
00:14:49.111 --> 00:14:50.311
I should know this one, Arizona,

354
00:14:50.311 --> 00:14:51.931
but I know that Oregon, some states,

355
00:14:51.931 --> 00:14:53.032
I'm pretty sure Arizona does,

356
00:14:53.032 --> 00:14:56.032
they have a philosophical objection.

357
00:14:56.032 --> 00:14:58.832
Many states don't but that means you don't have

358
00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:00.632
to have a religious exemption,

359
00:15:00.632 --> 00:15:02.634
but the two philosophically don't agree

360
00:15:02.634 --> 00:15:04.434
and you basically sign a waiver.

361
00:15:04.434 --> 00:15:08.734
Now the problem is that we're getting into a situation,

362
00:15:08.734 --> 00:15:11.674
with respect to the, I'll just use the bird flu,

363
00:15:11.674 --> 00:15:14.854
the avian flu situation that has been publicly stated

364
00:15:14.854 --> 00:15:17.835
by government officials that if we have an outbreak

365
00:15:17.835 --> 00:15:20.095
that it becomes pandemic/epidemic

366
00:15:20.095 --> 00:15:22.355
we will have mandatory vaccinations.

367
00:15:22.355 --> 00:15:24.695
And these mandatory vaccines will be enforced

368
00:15:24.695 --> 00:15:26.815
with security and armed guards.

369
00:15:26.815 --> 00:15:30.255
They have told us in the news that it will be

370
00:15:30.255 --> 00:15:32.025
a mandatory situation.

371
00:15:32.935 --> 00:15:34.195
<v Voiceover>And what do you think the truth is</v>

372
00:15:34.195 --> 00:15:36.265
behind bird flu?

373
00:15:37.415 --> 00:15:40.615
<v ->Well when you look at some of the information</v>

374
00:15:40.615 --> 00:15:44.555
that's been brought forward, the army stated

375
00:15:44.555 --> 00:15:48.795
they sent two men to Alaska to exhume a frozen body

376
00:15:48.795 --> 00:15:53.335
of a World War I soldier that had the bird flu H5N1.

377
00:15:53.335 --> 00:15:55.785
They claimed they isolated it to make vaccine.

378
00:15:56.775 --> 00:15:57.926
Now

379
00:16:00.156 --> 00:16:05.016
how are we going to know if this hits as an epidemic

380
00:16:05.016 --> 00:16:07.156
that it really is H5N!?

381
00:16:07.156 --> 00:16:09.696
Can we culture it?

382
00:16:09.696 --> 00:16:12.016
Can we have a lab tell us it's really H5N1?

383
00:16:12.016 --> 00:16:13.356
That sounds very cynical.

384
00:16:13.356 --> 00:16:16.336
But given historical documentation

385
00:16:16.336 --> 00:16:19.516
of what our own government has done

386
00:16:19.516 --> 00:16:22.736
in its own name, without our consent,

387
00:16:22.736 --> 00:16:25.896
leads one to question possibilities.

388
00:16:25.896 --> 00:16:29.376
I mean, I won't go in any wild theories we'll say.

389
00:16:29.376 --> 00:16:32.576
Just leave it at known fact of what has been done

390
00:16:32.576 --> 00:16:34.676
and what has happened that's documented.

391
00:16:34.676 --> 00:16:36.916
So we could have some pretty bad situations.

392
00:16:36.916 --> 00:16:39.976
Now I don't wanna lead this as gloom and doom

393
00:16:39.976 --> 00:16:43.376
so here's the flipside, the beauty of this.

394
00:16:43.376 --> 00:16:46.236
World War I, I cannot quote this doctor's name,

395
00:16:46.236 --> 00:16:48.956
it's an anecdote but it's supposedly well-documented,

396
00:16:48.956 --> 00:16:52.096
I've seen it in print once and they have the documentation.

397
00:16:52.096 --> 00:16:55.896
He had, I wanna say, about 25 or 30 patients

398
00:16:55.896 --> 00:16:57.896
that all had the flu.

399
00:16:57.896 --> 00:16:59.976
This was when, I think, the mortality rate

400
00:16:59.976 --> 00:17:04.976
was 50 plus percent with the World War I H5N1.

401
00:17:05.116 --> 00:17:06.816
Now one thing has not been discussed,

402
00:17:06.816 --> 00:17:09.196
to my knowledge publicly, most people are not aware

403
00:17:09.196 --> 00:17:11.256
of what stopped World War I.

404
00:17:11.256 --> 00:17:13.916
It's because both sides were vaccinated with live,

405
00:17:13.916 --> 00:17:17.396
unattenuated virus and they were too sick to fight.

406
00:17:17.396 --> 00:17:18.996
That's what I was always been taught and told.

407
00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:19.797
<v Voiceover>Seriously?</v>

408
00:17:19.797 --> 00:17:22.218
<v ->Seriously, that's what stopped it.</v>

409
00:17:22.218 --> 00:17:24.558
<v Voiceover>Hey, there's an upside to vaccines</v>

410
00:17:24.558 --> 00:17:26.338
that stops war (laughs).

411
00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:28.259
<v ->Right, if that's incorrect somebody can see this</v>

412
00:17:28.259 --> 00:17:29.179
and call us and tell us.

413
00:17:29.179 --> 00:17:32.259
But I've had that verified more than once.

414
00:17:32.259 --> 00:17:34.440
That's really what stopped it.

415
00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.180
The fact that they used an unattenuated live virus

416
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:44.000
is why it proliferated and was so deadly, in my opinion.

417
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.380
Now this same physician knew there was no help

418
00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:52.020
for his patients, so what he did was he hung

419
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.620
hydrogen peroxide.

420
00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.000
Now I want to--

421
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.240
<v Voiceover>When you say hung hydrogen--</v>

422
00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.540
<v ->Oh I'm sorry, that's a slang term in the hospital,</v>

423
00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.641
one in the medical world.

424
00:18:00.641 --> 00:18:02.241
He did an IV, an intravenous--

425
00:18:02.241 --> 00:18:02.901
<v Voiceover>IV, right.</v>

426
00:18:02.901 --> 00:18:03.681
<v ->I apologize, I apologize.</v>

427
00:18:03.681 --> 00:18:04.421
<v Voiceover>Hanging a bag of--</v>

428
00:18:04.421 --> 00:18:05.683
<v ->Hanging a bag of IV, yes.</v>

429
00:18:05.683 --> 00:18:06.284
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

430
00:18:06.284 --> 00:18:07.744
<v ->I apologize.</v>

431
00:18:07.744 --> 00:18:08.805
<v Voiceover>They got IVs of--</v>

432
00:18:08.805 --> 00:18:10.785
<v ->It's like when we're all in different worlds</v>

433
00:18:10.785 --> 00:18:12.645
and you have these little slang terms (laughs).

434
00:18:12.645 --> 00:18:16.545
But yes, he provided an intravenous solution

435
00:18:16.545 --> 00:18:18.085
of hydrogen peroxide.

436
00:18:18.085 --> 00:18:21.165
There was no note known of the concentration.

437
00:18:21.165 --> 00:18:26.165
But it's been assumed or thought to be about 0.03%.

438
00:18:27.305 --> 00:18:31.345
What you buy in the grocery store or the drug store is 3%

439
00:18:31.345 --> 00:18:34.345
Now you could not use that in this fashion

440
00:18:34.345 --> 00:18:37.605
because it has excipients and different things in it.

441
00:18:37.605 --> 00:18:41.505
What one needs, if one is going to do similar procedure,

442
00:18:41.505 --> 00:18:44.865
would be atleast reagent grade hydrogen peroxide

443
00:18:44.865 --> 00:18:46.785
which means that it's clean.

444
00:18:46.785 --> 00:18:50.125
Well reagent grade means that you can use that substance

445
00:18:50.125 --> 00:18:54.025
in a chemical experiment knowing you have a clean product

446
00:18:54.025 --> 00:18:55.185
with no contaminants.

447
00:18:55.185 --> 00:18:56.625
<v Voiceover>And this is something I do hear</v>

448
00:18:56.625 --> 00:18:59.746
from time to time, people will say that they've been taking

449
00:18:59.746 --> 00:19:01.946
minor doses of hydrogen peroxide

450
00:19:01.946 --> 00:19:03.266
to maintain their immune systems.

451
00:19:03.266 --> 00:19:06.147
Please go and expand on this a little bit more

452
00:19:06.147 --> 00:19:08.087
so we don't have people in the drugstore

453
00:19:08.087 --> 00:19:09.068
taking it home.

454
00:19:09.068 --> 00:19:10.449
<v ->Sure, sure.</v>

455
00:19:11.879 --> 00:19:16.239
A lot of that has come through a man named Wally Grotz,

456
00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:20.419
they call him Mr. Peroxide, Professor Peroxide,

457
00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:24.120
and Dr. Charles Farr, Dr. Farr is deceased,

458
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.680
he was a PhD M.D., PhD in Biochemistry,

459
00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.280
everybody call him Dr. Farr, Dr. Peroxide.

460
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.660
Dr. Farr, Charlie was the first person

461
00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.400
to do intravenous peroxide.

462
00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.780
<v Voiceover>P-H-A-R-R or?</v>

463
00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.060
<v ->P-H-A-R-R, correct.</v>

464
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.080
No, I'm sorry, F-A-R-R.

465
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.400
<v Voiceover>Oh F-A-R-R?</v>

466
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.620
<v ->Correct.</v>

467
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:46.080
He said, when his nurse hooked him up, connected the IV up,

468
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.180
she dialed 4-1 and held the last one,

469
00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:53.520
excuse me 9-1 and held the last one in the event,

470
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.060
they didn't know what was gonna happen to him.

471
00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.320
They've never tried peroxide in anybody and he said,

472
00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.200
"I'll be the guinea pig.

473
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.400
"I'm the PhD, it was my idea."

474
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.620
And he knew it wouldn't hurt him.

475
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.641
I need to interject this.

476
00:20:04.641 --> 00:20:07.781
Our white blood cells make hydrogen peroxide

477
00:20:07.781 --> 00:20:10.741
and superoxides and hydrochloric acid.

478
00:20:10.741 --> 00:20:12.982
That is how when they engulf an organism

479
00:20:12.982 --> 00:20:16.482
they destroy that organism, okay.

480
00:20:16.482 --> 00:20:21.482
The peroxides attack proteins and that's the mechanism.

481
00:20:22.543 --> 00:20:26.123
So when one says, "I have a low immune system,"

482
00:20:26.123 --> 00:20:27.423
you can look at it from the standpoint

483
00:20:27.423 --> 00:20:29.783
of not having sufficient oxygen onboard

484
00:20:29.783 --> 00:20:31.843
that can be converted to peroxides.

485
00:20:31.843 --> 00:20:34.944
Now back to the doctor with the 30 patients in the--

486
00:20:34.944 --> 00:20:37.664
<v Voiceover>And with her finger on the dial 9-1.</v>

487
00:20:37.664 --> 00:20:39.484
<v ->What she did is she finally hung up</v>

488
00:20:39.484 --> 00:20:40.424
because Charlie was fine.

489
00:20:40.424 --> 00:20:42.444
And I got to meet him before he passed away

490
00:20:42.444 --> 00:20:43.684
and talked with him several times

491
00:20:43.684 --> 00:20:46.664
and it's quite a cute little story but he said,

492
00:20:46.664 --> 00:20:48.484
"Yes, everybody was just panicking and I'm sitting there

493
00:20:48.484 --> 00:20:49.944
"just knowing I'm gonna be fine."

494
00:20:49.944 --> 00:20:51.245
Because what happened as the peroxide

495
00:20:51.245 --> 00:20:53.825
hits the red blood cells disassociates

496
00:20:53.825 --> 00:20:56.185
and parts the oxygen into the red blood cells

497
00:20:56.185 --> 00:20:58.825
and adds oxygen into the system,

498
00:20:58.825 --> 00:21:00.845
goes into the white blood cells as well

499
00:21:00.845 --> 00:21:03.205
and you basically strengthen the immune function.

500
00:21:03.205 --> 00:21:06.885
But the doctor with the bird flu patients, the H5N1s

501
00:21:06.885 --> 00:21:09.305
in World War I, they all lived.

502
00:21:09.305 --> 00:21:11.026
That was the beauty, they all lived.

503
00:21:11.026 --> 00:21:12.626
<v Voiceover>And so why haven't we heard more about</v>

504
00:21:12.626 --> 00:21:14.366
hydrogen peroxide therapy?

505
00:21:14.366 --> 00:21:18.827
<v ->Well that will bring us into the arena</v>

506
00:21:18.827 --> 00:21:23.508
of the conspiracy of the Food and Drug Administration

507
00:21:23.508 --> 00:21:25.848
against anything other than pharmaceutical.

508
00:21:25.848 --> 00:21:27.628
And you notice I didn't use the word "theory".

509
00:21:27.628 --> 00:21:28.268
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

510
00:21:28.268 --> 00:21:30.646
<v ->Okay, because as one noted person</v>

511
00:21:30.646 --> 00:21:34.966
has said in film recently, "When you have one fact

512
00:21:34.966 --> 00:21:38.426
"or you find one lie with an official story,

513
00:21:38.426 --> 00:21:42.186
"then you must call it no longer theory but conspiracy."

514
00:21:42.186 --> 00:21:44.926
And Black's Law Dictionary definition of conspiracy

515
00:21:44.926 --> 00:21:46.426
only takes two people.

516
00:21:46.426 --> 00:21:48.786
I would admit there's a fine line

517
00:21:48.786 --> 00:21:50.926
between conspiracy and logistics.

518
00:21:50.926 --> 00:21:52.276
Okay.

519
00:21:53.126 --> 00:21:55.586
And I said the FDA because it's blatantly obvious,

520
00:21:55.586 --> 00:22:00.064
and if one wants a good example we'll use tryptophan.

521
00:22:00.064 --> 00:22:01.902
Tryptophan's one of the eight essential, I'll make it short,

522
00:22:01.902 --> 00:22:05.462
eight essential amino acids for life.

523
00:22:05.462 --> 00:22:07.802
It was never taken out of baby formula.

524
00:22:07.802 --> 00:22:11.182
The whole time it was off the market for adults, okay.

525
00:22:11.182 --> 00:22:12.438
So they've known--

526
00:22:12.438 --> 00:22:13.698
<v Voiceover>That should tell you something.</v>

527
00:22:13.698 --> 00:22:16.138
<v ->Yes, they knew that tryptophan did not cause</v>

528
00:22:16.138 --> 00:22:20.696
eosinophilia but they had to bring Prozac on the market.

529
00:22:20.696 --> 00:22:21.876
So we'll leave it at that.

530
00:22:21.876 --> 00:22:23.376
<v Voiceover>And we can go through that</v>

531
00:22:23.376 --> 00:22:25.776
on any number of drugs and natural elements.

532
00:22:25.776 --> 00:22:28.556
I've read also a fair amount on it.

533
00:22:28.556 --> 00:22:30.136
<v ->Let's just throw this out.</v>

534
00:22:30.136 --> 00:22:34.055
Tryptophan was off the market for almost six years, I think,

535
00:22:34.055 --> 00:22:36.052
yet all I can remember are some of the things

536
00:22:36.052 --> 00:22:37.652
that were laced back in the '80s

537
00:22:37.652 --> 00:22:39.092
and killed a number of people,

538
00:22:39.092 --> 00:22:40.292
I don't want to say, I can't use,

539
00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:42.732
Tylenol or whatever was laced with things.

540
00:22:42.732 --> 00:22:45.192
They only pulled those batches off the shelf, what,

541
00:22:45.192 --> 00:22:47.592
30 days, 60 days and back on the market?

542
00:22:47.592 --> 00:22:49.332
Here you have naturally occurring amino acid

543
00:22:49.332 --> 00:22:52.330
that is necessary for life pulled for six years.

544
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:55.170
I get angry because I say, "The American people sat back

545
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:58.230
"and allowed the FDA to legislate life."

546
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:59.498
But we'll leave that.

547
00:23:00.588 --> 00:23:01.848
<v Voiceover>So going back to peroxide,</v>

548
00:23:01.848 --> 00:23:02.988
this falls in that category.

549
00:23:02.988 --> 00:23:03.548
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

550
00:23:03.548 --> 00:23:05.608
What it amounts to is that anything,

551
00:23:05.608 --> 00:23:08.478
and I'm gonna say it's an obvious,

552
00:23:10.168 --> 00:23:11.188
without being too redundant,

553
00:23:11.188 --> 00:23:13.648
it's an obvious observation.

554
00:23:13.648 --> 00:23:15.646
When you look at the FDA's track record

555
00:23:15.646 --> 00:23:18.966
or their history of who they prosecute and how,

556
00:23:18.966 --> 00:23:21.266
that they've gone after alternative medicine.

557
00:23:21.266 --> 00:23:23.746
And I'll give you another good example.

558
00:23:23.746 --> 00:23:27.006
This is a DEA statistic but the FDA allows this.

559
00:23:27.006 --> 00:23:30.604
The average 100,000 people die per year

560
00:23:30.604 --> 00:23:33.604
of legal drug interactions is the fourth leading cause

561
00:23:33.604 --> 00:23:36.104
of death in America.

562
00:23:36.104 --> 00:23:39.784
Maximum, I have heard 250,000 have died in a given year

563
00:23:39.784 --> 00:23:41.344
of legal drugs interactions.

564
00:23:41.344 --> 00:23:45.324
This is not overdoses, this is too many drugs on board

565
00:23:45.324 --> 00:23:48.344
interacting and you get a chemical potpourri,

566
00:23:48.344 --> 00:23:49.964
unfortunately.

567
00:23:49.964 --> 00:23:51.064
The FDA allows this.

568
00:23:51.064 --> 00:23:52.804
I mean, look at Vioxx, what, Vioxx killed

569
00:23:52.804 --> 00:23:55.244
maybe 100,000 people before they ever thought

570
00:23:55.244 --> 00:23:57.732
about pulling it from the market.

571
00:23:59.282 --> 00:24:00.802
So, an example.

572
00:24:00.802 --> 00:24:04.082
Now back to what we can do about some of this.

573
00:24:04.082 --> 00:24:06.442
The peroxide works very well.

574
00:24:06.442 --> 00:24:09.342
With flu, for example, general flu,

575
00:24:09.342 --> 00:24:12.762
and I qualify the flu, not a head cold or a chest cold,

576
00:24:12.762 --> 00:24:14.482
but where I say the hair hurts.

577
00:24:14.482 --> 00:24:16.060
You just don't wanna be touched.

578
00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.520
<v Voiceover>I know what that feels like, yeah.</v>

579
00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.400
<v ->Just don't touch 'em.</v>

580
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.620
Yeah, yeah, your hair hurts.

581
00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.780
Somebody walks in the room, "Don't get any closer.

582
00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.540
"You're close enough."

583
00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.900
In many instances, I have seen this

584
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.600
but I didn't use just peroxide,

585
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.780
I use the other therapies we're going to discuss:

586
00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.740
oxygen ozone therapy from Germany,

587
00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.680
ultraviolet light blood irradiation from this country.

588
00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.480
But Dr. Farr had done this a number of times

589
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.180
and he gave us several anecdotal cases,

590
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.260
one of the first lectures I went to conferences with him.

591
00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.200
One of our people in the group with us

592
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.180
called him on a Sunday morning, like 7:30, and said,

593
00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:50.660
"Charlie, I got the flu.

594
00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.960
"I wanna come to class today, what can I do?"

595
00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.418
So Dr. Farr went to his room, hung a--

596
00:24:56.418 --> 00:24:57.298
<v Voiceover>Started an IV.</v>

597
00:24:57.298 --> 00:25:00.356
<v ->Started an IV peroxide, sorry.</v>

598
00:25:00.356 --> 00:25:02.456
Started a bag of peroxide on him or her,

599
00:25:02.456 --> 00:25:04.356
I'm not sure which was, but nonetheless

600
00:25:04.356 --> 00:25:07.314
by lunch time the person was normal, seriously.

601
00:25:07.314 --> 00:25:08.792
Now we get to beginning symptoms,

602
00:25:08.792 --> 00:25:11.152
they were not into the flu per se.

603
00:25:11.152 --> 00:25:13.072
<v Voiceover>And this was done via IV.</v>

604
00:25:13.072 --> 00:25:13.812
<v ->Via IV.</v>

605
00:25:13.812 --> 00:25:16.112
<v Voiceover>Is this something that can be done orally?</v>

606
00:25:16.112 --> 00:25:17.772
<v ->You don't get the same effect</v>

607
00:25:17.772 --> 00:25:22.348
and I'll discuss that at this point.

608
00:25:22.348 --> 00:25:26.122
Wally Grotz, I mentioned earlier, Mr. Peroxide,

609
00:25:26.122 --> 00:25:30.062
Wally had pulled together the papers done on peroxide.

610
00:25:30.062 --> 00:25:32.862
There are approximately 3,000 papers

611
00:25:32.862 --> 00:25:34.542
in the conventional medical literature

612
00:25:34.542 --> 00:25:36.102
on the use of peroxide.

613
00:25:36.102 --> 00:25:40.463
Dr. Farr pulled together about the 800 most prevalent

614
00:25:40.463 --> 00:25:44.383
or beneficial papers and with reference to peroxide

615
00:25:44.383 --> 00:25:45.943
and put them in a single book.

616
00:25:45.943 --> 00:25:47.723
And they're all referenced

617
00:25:47.723 --> 00:25:49.703
in a conventional medical literature.

618
00:25:49.703 --> 00:25:54.445
But taking it orally you don't get the

619
00:25:54.445 --> 00:25:57.405
crossover of oxygen into the bloodstream.

620
00:25:57.405 --> 00:25:58.825
There is a misconception there.

621
00:25:58.825 --> 00:26:00.325
And I'll just throw this out to those out there

622
00:26:00.325 --> 00:26:03.406
that would just logically look at this.

623
00:26:03.406 --> 00:26:06.906
When you put peroxide in contact with an amino acid

624
00:26:06.906 --> 00:26:09.946
or a protein it immediately reacts with it.

625
00:26:09.946 --> 00:26:12.146
Therefore, when you drink peroxide

626
00:26:12.146 --> 00:26:15.766
it's going to react with the stomach lining, if you will,

627
00:26:15.766 --> 00:26:19.846
and that way it will disassociate and give you oxygen

628
00:26:19.846 --> 00:26:22.126
released in the gut, in the GI tract.

629
00:26:22.126 --> 00:26:24.446
Where I think people get the great benefit

630
00:26:24.446 --> 00:26:28.226
is that our gastrointestinal tract

631
00:26:28.226 --> 00:26:30.746
was meant to be more aerobic,

632
00:26:30.746 --> 00:26:33.486
without sounding crude, like a cow, if you will,

633
00:26:33.486 --> 00:26:38.446
that you have more herbal matter or more plant matter

634
00:26:38.446 --> 00:26:43.446
giving you a neutral acid balance like 7pH

635
00:26:43.446 --> 00:26:45.146
with aerobic bacteria.

636
00:26:45.146 --> 00:26:47.646
What really happens in reality is most people

637
00:26:47.646 --> 00:26:50.226
have an anaerobic culture in the gut

638
00:26:50.226 --> 00:26:53.076
with varying anaerobic negative bacteria.

639
00:26:54.186 --> 00:26:58.827
The medical term is dysbiosis or improper flora balance.

640
00:26:58.827 --> 00:27:02.147
With this, you have an onslaught of chemicals

641
00:27:02.147 --> 00:27:04.027
from the anaerobic bacteria and this is documented

642
00:27:04.027 --> 00:27:06.327
in a book called "Human Intestinal Flora"

643
00:27:06.327 --> 00:27:07.789
by Drasar and Hill,

644
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:10.189
two board-certified gastroenterologists.

645
00:27:10.189 --> 00:27:12.449
So when you take the peroxide I think what happens,

646
00:27:12.449 --> 00:27:15.329
and this is just my own philosophies, position on it

647
00:27:15.329 --> 00:27:19.230
is that you correct that anaerobic condition in the gut

648
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:23.470
and put more aerobic bacteria in place of it over time.

649
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:24.771
That's why you see people say,

650
00:27:24.771 --> 00:27:27.391
"Oh my arthritis went away or this went away."

651
00:27:27.391 --> 00:27:30.471
But the misconception is getting appreciable amount

652
00:27:30.471 --> 00:27:32.152
of oxygen into the bloodstream.

653
00:27:32.152 --> 00:27:32.992
<v Voiceover>The blood, right.</v>

654
00:27:32.992 --> 00:27:34.372
<v ->What I'm saying in around about way</v>

655
00:27:34.372 --> 00:27:35.453
I'll just say it bluntly this way,

656
00:27:35.453 --> 00:27:38.693
is that it is not physiologically possible

657
00:27:38.693 --> 00:27:40.913
because of the reaction with proteins, of peroxide

658
00:27:40.913 --> 00:27:44.753
to impart much oxygen through the mucosal barrier

659
00:27:44.753 --> 00:27:47.933
of the GI tract with the stomach to alter what is called

660
00:27:47.933 --> 00:27:52.394
the partial pressure of oxygen within the red blood cell.

661
00:27:52.394 --> 00:27:54.354
It just can't happen.

662
00:27:54.354 --> 00:27:57.334
So that's why I say the health benefit is there.

663
00:28:00.814 --> 00:28:03.714
Also the intravenous use or the peroxide is a direct effect.

664
00:28:03.714 --> 00:28:06.794
I don't like to use the word "antimicrobial"

665
00:28:06.794 --> 00:28:10.214
or "antiviral bacterial" but it is obvious

666
00:28:10.214 --> 00:28:12.667
that it does something along those lines.

667
00:28:14.357 --> 00:28:15.257
Go ahead with your question.

668
00:28:15.257 --> 00:28:16.097
<v Voiceover>Well I was gonna say,</v>

669
00:28:16.097 --> 00:28:19.577
that starts moving into what you often pair it with

670
00:28:19.577 --> 00:28:20.618
in your own practice.

671
00:28:20.618 --> 00:28:21.438
<v ->Yes.</v>

672
00:28:21.438 --> 00:28:24.038
<v Voiceover>It seems to me the real trick here</v>

673
00:28:24.038 --> 00:28:28.098
is finding a doctor that has this information

674
00:28:28.098 --> 00:28:29.638
and these modalities available.

675
00:28:29.638 --> 00:28:30.819
That's a real issue.

676
00:28:30.819 --> 00:28:32.939
There aren't that many like you out there.

677
00:28:32.939 --> 00:28:35.440
So let's talk about what's possible and maybe

678
00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.880
people can begin, not just looking for it,

679
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.360
but even demanding that these be made available

680
00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.881
through their favorite MDs.

681
00:28:42.862 --> 00:28:44.282
If they're open to it.

682
00:28:44.282 --> 00:28:46.422
So what else besides the peroxide?

683
00:28:46.422 --> 00:28:49.602
<v ->I'll go next to the oxygen ozone therapy.</v>

684
00:28:49.602 --> 00:28:51.762
The interesting aspect of oxygen ozone

685
00:28:51.762 --> 00:28:53.022
is that it's been used in Germany

686
00:28:53.022 --> 00:28:54.942
for the better part of 100 years.

687
00:28:54.942 --> 00:28:58.962
It was initially used to sterilize water, clean water.

688
00:28:58.962 --> 00:29:02.222
Interestingly enough in America, some 40 to 50 cities

689
00:29:02.222 --> 00:29:06.582
use ozone to clean their grey water, their city water.

690
00:29:06.582 --> 00:29:11.582
The ozone is the second most potent oxidizer on the planet.

691
00:29:12.342 --> 00:29:15.845
It's seconded only by fluoride or fluorine I should say.

692
00:29:15.845 --> 00:29:17.445
It's actually technically fluorine.

693
00:29:18.486 --> 00:29:19.966
<v Voiceover>So people at first glance think,</v>

694
00:29:19.966 --> 00:29:20.806
"Oh it's scary."

695
00:29:20.806 --> 00:29:23.906
<v ->Right, however, when you look at the aspect</v>

696
00:29:23.906 --> 00:29:28.366
that ozone, I'll do this analogy.

697
00:29:28.366 --> 00:29:29.486
I've been asked many times,

698
00:29:29.486 --> 00:29:32.426
"If you had to have one healing modality,"

699
00:29:32.426 --> 00:29:35.947
now granted you have to assume you have technology,

700
00:29:35.947 --> 00:29:37.607
okay, we have to like twist in a few things,

701
00:29:37.607 --> 00:29:41.407
but if I can only one therapy or one modality, the ozone,

702
00:29:41.407 --> 00:29:44.947
because I can sterilize my drinking water

703
00:29:44.947 --> 00:29:49.207
all the way to treating skin problems and all in between.

704
00:29:49.207 --> 00:29:50.947
I just say, if you look at the German literature,

705
00:29:50.947 --> 00:29:53.687
there's a book "Use of Ozone in Medicine",

706
00:29:53.687 --> 00:29:58.687
originally written by Dr. V. Baun and doctor,

707
00:30:00.489 --> 00:30:02.189
I'm drawing a blank on that, I can't believe it,

708
00:30:02.189 --> 00:30:03.510
but nonetheless.

709
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:08.151
Now it's written by Dr. V. Baun, she's a PhD in Biochem.

710
00:30:08.151 --> 00:30:09.232
Dr. Reiling, I'm sorry.

711
00:30:09.232 --> 00:30:13.132
Dr. V. Baun is a PhD, Dr. Reiling is an M.D.

712
00:30:14.233 --> 00:30:16.673
And the book basically has use of ozone

713
00:30:16.673 --> 00:30:19.793
in treating illnesses from A to Z.

714
00:30:19.793 --> 00:30:22.015
I used the phrase acne to herpes zoster

715
00:30:22.015 --> 00:30:23.556
(mumbles) zoster.

716
00:30:23.556 --> 00:30:26.056
You can clear herpes virus from the body.

717
00:30:26.056 --> 00:30:29.117
You can get a non-detectable viral testing,

718
00:30:29.117 --> 00:30:31.997
a quantitative analysis by using ozone with herpes,

719
00:30:31.997 --> 00:30:33.637
hepatitis A, B and C.

720
00:30:33.637 --> 00:30:34.938
<v Voiceover>Seriously, permanent effect.</v>

721
00:30:34.938 --> 00:30:35.520
<v ->Permanent effect.</v>

722
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:35.901
<v Voiceover>Not temporary?</v>

723
00:30:35.901 --> 00:30:37.081
<v ->Not temporary, correct.</v>

724
00:30:37.081 --> 00:30:38.421
It's not easy.

725
00:30:38.421 --> 00:30:40.801
I mean, I don't wanna make it sound like a piece of cake,

726
00:30:40.801 --> 00:30:43.461
that it's two treatments and you're a done deal.

727
00:30:43.461 --> 00:30:46.781
There are best case scenarios and worst case scenarios.

728
00:30:46.781 --> 00:30:48.722
But the beauty of ozone and, unfortunately,

729
00:30:48.722 --> 00:30:51.282
this has to be an intravenous procedure.

730
00:30:51.282 --> 00:30:53.302
Now there are people that do what I use the phrase

731
00:30:53.302 --> 00:30:56.482
"direct gas injection into the vein".

732
00:30:56.482 --> 00:31:00.282
It is a little bit helpful but the people doing this

733
00:31:00.282 --> 00:31:03.082
have the misconception that the ozone's acting

734
00:31:03.082 --> 00:31:05.982
as a pac person like the old Pacman game

735
00:31:05.982 --> 00:31:07.384
going in and chewing up viruses.

736
00:31:07.384 --> 00:31:08.824
It doesn't work that way.

737
00:31:08.824 --> 00:31:10.624
Yes, the volume of blood that you treat

738
00:31:10.624 --> 00:31:15.404
it has been sterilized on contact.

739
00:31:15.404 --> 00:31:17.984
But that's not why you're imparting back into the body.

740
00:31:17.984 --> 00:31:19.606
What you're imparting back into the body

741
00:31:19.606 --> 00:31:23.886
is oxygenated blood and the blood going back in

742
00:31:23.886 --> 00:31:27.968
functions as an autogenous vaccine or you get

743
00:31:27.968 --> 00:31:32.728
an immunological response in a vaccine-like nature.

744
00:31:32.728 --> 00:31:36.648
Now with viral problems, viral conditions,

745
00:31:36.648 --> 00:31:38.688
German literature backs this up,

746
00:31:38.688 --> 00:31:39.948
at the end of the ozone treatment,

747
00:31:39.948 --> 00:31:41.368
when you're giving the blood back,

748
00:31:41.368 --> 00:31:44.868
a latter 3 to 5cc's of blood you draw that off

749
00:31:44.868 --> 00:31:47.168
with a syringe and use the hypodermic needle

750
00:31:47.168 --> 00:31:49.008
and inject that into the muscle.

751
00:31:49.008 --> 00:31:51.928
What this does, the blood going in the muscle,

752
00:31:51.928 --> 00:31:54.588
is a foreign object.

753
00:31:54.588 --> 00:31:58.308
Therefore, the immune system has to attack that blood,

754
00:31:58.308 --> 00:32:00.228
tear it apart, if you will, clean it up.

755
00:32:00.228 --> 00:32:03.389
It's a bruise, it's similar to a bruise.

756
00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:05.609
And when you do this, or when the body does this,

757
00:32:05.609 --> 00:32:08.369
the immune system then, if you have a virus in your body,

758
00:32:08.369 --> 00:32:10.769
that virus has been oxidized, torn into parts

759
00:32:10.769 --> 00:32:12.169
and pieces, if you will.

760
00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:13.829
At that point the immune system then

761
00:32:13.829 --> 00:32:16.109
can recognize those viral particles

762
00:32:16.109 --> 00:32:17.929
because in most instances, what we've been taught

763
00:32:17.929 --> 00:32:21.429
in immunology, in microbiology, is that viruses

764
00:32:21.429 --> 00:32:24.169
use our own genetic material over time

765
00:32:24.169 --> 00:32:26.249
to replicate themselves.

766
00:32:26.249 --> 00:32:29.369
And therefore, when you've oxidized them in the muscle

767
00:32:29.369 --> 00:32:30.789
the immune system can recognize it

768
00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:33.761
and mount the appropriate immunological response.

769
00:32:35.431 --> 00:32:36.811
<v Voiceover>So you said when you replace the blood,</v>

770
00:32:36.811 --> 00:32:38.591
so tell us what this looks like.

771
00:32:38.591 --> 00:32:39.714
What are you talking about?
<v ->The procedure?</v>

772
00:32:39.714 --> 00:32:40.634
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

773
00:32:40.634 --> 00:32:43.115
<v ->Basically you place a needle or a catheter,</v>

774
00:32:43.115 --> 00:32:44.795
IV cath in the arm.

775
00:32:44.795 --> 00:32:46.675
It doesn't matter what vein but you preferably want a vein

776
00:32:46.675 --> 00:32:49.816
that will supply you a fairly rapid flow of blood.

777
00:32:49.816 --> 00:32:53.256
But if you're taking about 100 to 200 cc's of blood

778
00:32:53.256 --> 00:32:56.101
you collect that, I use a vacuum bottle, you collect it,

779
00:32:56.101 --> 00:32:59.801
then you instill in that a volume of ozone gas

780
00:32:59.801 --> 00:33:02.001
depending upon the illness you're treating

781
00:33:02.001 --> 00:33:05.541
that would dictate the volume and the concentration.

782
00:33:05.541 --> 00:33:07.882
I use the phrase "concentration" because we're referring

783
00:33:07.882 --> 00:33:12.882
to the analogy or analogous to say an aspirin 10 milligrams

784
00:33:12.923 --> 00:33:14.923
versus 30 milligrams.

785
00:33:14.923 --> 00:33:15.714
That's the only difference.

786
00:33:17.484 --> 00:33:20.124
And after you've withdrawn the blood, instill the ozone gas

787
00:33:20.124 --> 00:33:24.164
you agitate it and therefore, you're exposing

788
00:33:24.164 --> 00:33:25.765
the largest surface area of--

789
00:33:25.765 --> 00:33:26.905
<v Voiceover>Like shaking it, you mean?</v>

790
00:33:26.905 --> 00:33:27.525
<v ->Yes.</v>

791
00:33:28.266 --> 00:33:29.727
Yes, it's an agitation.

792
00:33:29.727 --> 00:33:30.688
The reason you're not shaking it

793
00:33:30.688 --> 00:33:32.088
because you'll damage the red blood cell.

794
00:33:32.088 --> 00:33:33.528
So we swirl it.

795
00:33:33.528 --> 00:33:36.369
You'll still lose a small percentage but it's negligible

796
00:33:36.369 --> 00:33:38.869
with respect to the benefit you're giving the patient.

797
00:33:38.869 --> 00:33:41.089
And then you just return the blood back to the body

798
00:33:41.089 --> 00:33:43.009
the same way you've taken it out.

799
00:33:43.009 --> 00:33:46.049
And it takes about 20, 30 minutes.

800
00:33:46.049 --> 00:33:47.330
<v Voiceover>20, 30 minutes.</v>

801
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:49.290
Once it's back to the body,

802
00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:51.290
then is it a pretty quick process

803
00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:54.030
where your immune response starts kicking in

804
00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:55.490
and recognizing the--

805
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:56.770
<v ->24, 48 hours.</v>

806
00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:58.310
<v Voiceover>24 to 48, okay.</v>

807
00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:01.131
<v ->Everyone in the individual but you do see a response</v>

808
00:34:01.131 --> 00:34:02.411
in that timeframe.

809
00:34:02.411 --> 00:34:05.271
And in some instances, depending upon the condition

810
00:34:05.271 --> 00:34:07.271
or the illness you're working with, many times

811
00:34:07.271 --> 00:34:10.091
I've had people say, "I feel better already,"

812
00:34:10.091 --> 00:34:11.371
before they even get out of the chair,

813
00:34:11.371 --> 00:34:14.252
before the treatment is completed.

814
00:34:14.252 --> 00:34:19.252
I do not want to convey that this is some miracle cure

815
00:34:19.952 --> 00:34:23.072
or some panacea, it is not.

816
00:34:23.072 --> 00:34:26.352
But it does have a wide variety of benefits and uses,

817
00:34:26.352 --> 00:34:28.373
there's no question of that.

818
00:34:28.373 --> 00:34:28.993
Okay.

819
00:34:28.993 --> 00:34:30.553
<v Voiceover>What about ultraviolet?</v>

820
00:34:30.553 --> 00:34:32.333
<v ->Ultraviolet's a therapy that's been around</v>

821
00:34:32.333 --> 00:34:36.433
for approximately, the better part of say 80 years,

822
00:34:36.433 --> 00:34:41.433
developed in the early 20s by Dr. Emmett K. Knott

823
00:34:41.593 --> 00:34:45.134
of Seattle, Washington, a doctor of science, not an M.D.

824
00:34:45.134 --> 00:34:48.614
It was a degree that, I think it's still is conferred

825
00:34:48.614 --> 00:34:51.945
but he was more of an inventor if you will.

826
00:34:55.515 --> 00:34:57.235
Back then they knew that ultraviolet light

827
00:34:57.235 --> 00:35:00.355
would destroy organisms and they didn't have antibiotics,

828
00:35:00.355 --> 00:35:03.716
so that was the big impetus to do this device.

829
00:35:03.716 --> 00:35:05.716
<v Voiceover>I mean, this is really primitive information</v>

830
00:35:05.716 --> 00:35:08.876
in a sense and that the Romans knew about solariums

831
00:35:08.876 --> 00:35:12.316
and their ability to heal the body by lying in the sun.

832
00:35:12.316 --> 00:35:13.778
I mean, really simple stuff.

833
00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:16.179
<v ->Yes, and it's the same line.</v>

834
00:35:16.179 --> 00:35:20.479
I mean, during a similar era, this was in the early '20s,

835
00:35:20.479 --> 00:35:24.399
latter teens, Dr. Rolle in Switzerland

836
00:35:24.399 --> 00:35:28.159
had the sanatoriums or solariums as well

837
00:35:28.159 --> 00:35:30.119
healing tuberculosis with sunbaths.

838
00:35:30.119 --> 00:35:31.759
So it's the same thing, yes.

839
00:35:31.759 --> 00:35:34.939
They knew immune enhancement just by exposing the body.

840
00:35:34.939 --> 00:35:37.999
So Dr. Knott began looking at the fact that,

841
00:35:37.999 --> 00:35:40.059
well if we have bacterial infections,

842
00:35:40.059 --> 00:35:43.099
I mean at that time people died in the hospitals,

843
00:35:43.099 --> 00:35:46.019
not unlike today from what it's called septicemia

844
00:35:46.019 --> 00:35:49.039
which is the medical term if you will

845
00:35:49.039 --> 00:35:52.279
for severe blood poisoning, slime blood poisoning.

846
00:35:52.279 --> 00:35:55.459
And what that literally translates to is you have a bacteria

847
00:35:55.459 --> 00:35:57.239
growing in the blood.

848
00:35:57.239 --> 00:35:59.519
Notice the body has become a petridish if you will

849
00:35:59.519 --> 00:36:01.379
and it's life threatening.

850
00:36:01.379 --> 00:36:06.379
This day and time it's anywhere from four to six week

851
00:36:06.919 --> 00:36:11.919
intravenous antibiotic situation with no guarantee

852
00:36:12.479 --> 00:36:15.139
that you're going to get rid of the organism.

853
00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:16.539
Because we now have moved into an era

854
00:36:16.539 --> 00:36:19.979
of antibiotic resistant organisms.

855
00:36:19.979 --> 00:36:20.800
Or the MERSs.

856
00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.740
<v Voiceover>And we'll talk about that too,</v>

857
00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.000
a whole other subject.

858
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.600
So now what happens if you introduce

859
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.920
the ultraviolet therapy?

860
00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.440
<v ->The benefit of the ultraviolet is you do not have</v>

861
00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:34.440
to identify the virus or bacteria.

862
00:36:35.181 --> 00:36:38.021
Ultraviolet is non-discriminatory, it kills them all.

863
00:36:38.021 --> 00:36:40.453
That's the beauty of it, without harming the body.

864
00:36:42.483 --> 00:36:43.783
It depends on what literature you review

865
00:36:43.783 --> 00:36:47.343
but some 200 to 800,000 treatments of ultraviolet

866
00:36:47.343 --> 00:36:49.543
were performed over a 30-year period.

867
00:36:49.543 --> 00:36:54.271
Developed in the early '20s, first human treated in '23 and

868
00:36:54.271 --> 00:36:57.931
the last physician living to use it was a Dr. Breen Bland,

869
00:36:57.931 --> 00:36:59.431
it's who I acquired my instrument from

870
00:36:59.431 --> 00:37:00.831
in Memphis, Tennessee.

871
00:37:00.831 --> 00:37:03.331
And he'd used the instrument for about 40 years,

872
00:37:03.331 --> 00:37:05.331
graduated medical school in '42,

873
00:37:05.331 --> 00:37:09.692
he stopped practicing in

874
00:37:09.692 --> 00:37:13.533
1998, I believe, something like that.

875
00:37:13.533 --> 00:37:16.173
<v Voiceover>So the technology itself was relatively simple</v>

876
00:37:16.173 --> 00:37:17.293
if you're using a piece of equipment

877
00:37:17.293 --> 00:37:20.434
that has been around that long and still effective.

878
00:37:20.434 --> 00:37:21.275
<v ->Oh totally effective.</v>

879
00:37:21.275 --> 00:37:22.715
<v Voiceover>How does that procedure go?</v>

880
00:37:22.715 --> 00:37:25.516
<v ->That procedure is very similar to the ozone therapy.</v>

881
00:37:25.516 --> 00:37:27.516
Again, the only different here is that with ozone

882
00:37:27.516 --> 00:37:32.256
you don't base the volume of blood taken on body weight.

883
00:37:32.256 --> 00:37:34.276
With ultraviolet it's based upon body weight,

884
00:37:36.737 --> 00:37:40.617
1.5 cc's of blood per pound of body weight is what one uses.

885
00:37:40.617 --> 00:37:42.877
And there again you take the blood out

886
00:37:42.877 --> 00:37:46.617
and at this point I take the blood,

887
00:37:46.617 --> 00:37:50.698
and place or again

888
00:37:50.698 --> 00:37:53.758
add an IV of hydrogen peroxide

889
00:37:53.758 --> 00:37:56.078
because at that point once you've collected the blood

890
00:37:56.078 --> 00:37:57.578
you take it to the machine.

891
00:37:57.578 --> 00:37:59.358
And it runs to through the machine,

892
00:37:59.358 --> 00:38:01.258
at that point the ultraviolet device is called

893
00:38:01.258 --> 00:38:05.078
a Knott, K-N-O-T-T, Hemo-Irradiator.

894
00:38:05.078 --> 00:38:10.078
And it takes say 8 to 10 minutes, depending upon volume

895
00:38:10.118 --> 00:38:12.118
of blood to go through the machine.

896
00:38:12.118 --> 00:38:14.418
Well during this time the hydrogen peroxide

897
00:38:14.418 --> 00:38:16.658
has been running as an IV.

898
00:38:16.658 --> 00:38:18.578
Now currently, I understand the FDA is not pleased

899
00:38:18.578 --> 00:38:21.858
by peroxide, there was a death of a patient

900
00:38:21.858 --> 00:38:25.078
in South Carolina and they tried to blame on the peroxide.

901
00:38:25.078 --> 00:38:27.318
They finally realized that it was due to the chemotherapy

902
00:38:27.318 --> 00:38:29.718
the woman had had but they didn't want to admit that.

903
00:38:29.718 --> 00:38:33.318
They took the doctor's license anyway.

904
00:38:33.318 --> 00:38:34.979
Interesting, with South Carolina.

905
00:38:34.979 --> 00:38:36.579
<v Voiceover>Many people die on chemotherapy every year.</v>

906
00:38:36.579 --> 00:38:37.740
So yeah, go ahead.

907
00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:38.973
We won't go in that.

908
00:38:40.223 --> 00:38:43.303
<v ->With the ultraviolet device, the beauty of it is that</v>

909
00:38:43.303 --> 00:38:46.303
you don't really have to identify the organism.

910
00:38:46.303 --> 00:38:48.923
And in many cases, I mean it's nice,

911
00:38:48.923 --> 00:38:53.724
having come from the conventional science background

912
00:38:53.724 --> 00:38:56.284
we must validate with lab work, what we're working with.

913
00:38:57.645 --> 00:38:59.785
So I do that on a routine basis as well.

914
00:38:59.785 --> 00:39:01.805
I don't just (mumbles) somebody wholesale and go,

915
00:39:01.805 --> 00:39:02.645
"Well what have you got?

916
00:39:02.645 --> 00:39:04.485
"We'll figure it out later."

917
00:39:04.485 --> 00:39:07.665
But with respect to like bird flu and the influenzas

918
00:39:07.665 --> 00:39:09.805
or the viral problems you can clear them,

919
00:39:09.805 --> 00:39:13.585
I can't say the bird flu 'cause I haven't treated it yet.

920
00:39:13.585 --> 00:39:17.285
But let's just say from all past indications

921
00:39:17.285 --> 00:39:19.365
it would appear, knowing that peroxide

922
00:39:19.365 --> 00:39:22.645
cleared it in World War I, I would be very, very surprised

923
00:39:22.645 --> 00:39:27.505
if using the combination would not clear someone quickly

924
00:39:27.505 --> 00:39:29.965
because I have treated people with conventional,

925
00:39:29.965 --> 00:39:34.155
I shouldn't say conventional, with standard flu situations.

926
00:39:35.065 --> 00:39:37.025
I've been in this area where I'm living now

927
00:39:37.025 --> 00:39:40.905
for about 9, 10 years and consistently in the winters

928
00:39:40.905 --> 00:39:43.185
people come in with the flu, especially if it's

929
00:39:43.185 --> 00:39:44.805
in the beginning stages.

930
00:39:44.805 --> 00:39:47.505
And by that I mean the first 24 to 48 hours.

931
00:39:47.505 --> 00:39:48.605
It can even be a little bit later

932
00:39:48.605 --> 00:39:50.705
but once something starts like that

933
00:39:50.705 --> 00:39:52.885
many times you just let it run its course.

934
00:39:52.885 --> 00:39:54.065
It's going to.

935
00:39:54.065 --> 00:39:59.065
But I've had people come in that were, obviously,

936
00:39:59.105 --> 00:40:02.525
very uncomfortable, I say ill flu-like symptoms:

937
00:40:02.525 --> 00:40:04.725
the achiness, the headache, the fevers.

938
00:40:04.725 --> 00:40:09.405
And treat them 12 to 24 hours later they're normal,

939
00:40:09.405 --> 00:40:11.286
no symptoms, no signs of the flu.

940
00:40:11.286 --> 00:40:13.946
And I can give you several anecdotal cases.

941
00:40:13.946 --> 00:40:15.386
Yes, they're anecdotal.

942
00:40:15.386 --> 00:40:19.206
But when you have a number of them and it's consistent,

943
00:40:19.206 --> 00:40:21.986
it's pretty obvious that the therapy must work.

944
00:40:21.986 --> 00:40:23.246
I've done is myself.

945
00:40:23.246 --> 00:40:25.746
I mean, I've had situations where one class

946
00:40:25.746 --> 00:40:26.866
where the hair hurt.

947
00:40:26.866 --> 00:40:28.726
I mean, by midnight, one o'clock on a Friday night

948
00:40:28.726 --> 00:40:30.226
I knew I was ill.

949
00:40:30.226 --> 00:40:32.366
And by the next morning at 7 o'clock or actually

950
00:40:32.366 --> 00:40:35.366
by 2 in the morning I was so uncomfortable and achy

951
00:40:35.366 --> 00:40:37.566
that I really couldn't touch my own hair.

952
00:40:37.566 --> 00:40:38.986
So that's why I use that analogy.

953
00:40:38.986 --> 00:40:40.146
<v Voiceover>So who did the IV?</v>

954
00:40:40.146 --> 00:40:41.586
<v ->I did it.</v>

955
00:40:41.586 --> 00:40:42.526
I just got up the next morning

956
00:40:42.526 --> 00:40:45.886
and walked into my clinic and just said, "It's time,"

957
00:40:45.886 --> 00:40:47.086
and just did it myself.

958
00:40:47.086 --> 00:40:48.946
I mean, I can do that.

959
00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:51.586
And 24 hours later I was normal.

960
00:40:51.586 --> 00:40:54.686
Really normal, no symptoms at all.

961
00:40:54.686 --> 00:40:57.306
<v Voiceover>And according to Dr. Lorraine Day,</v>

962
00:40:57.306 --> 00:40:59.746
when she talked to the Center for Disease Control

963
00:40:59.746 --> 00:41:02.246
to the doctor there handling bird flu

964
00:41:02.246 --> 00:41:04.886
and the information to the doctors,

965
00:41:04.886 --> 00:41:06.486
she said, "At the end of that conversation

966
00:41:06.486 --> 00:41:08.386
"what it boiled down to is you can't tell the difference

967
00:41:08.386 --> 00:41:12.526
"in the symptoms between that bird flu and a standard flu."

968
00:41:12.526 --> 00:41:14.966
And in fact, on record, there are only a few people

969
00:41:14.966 --> 00:41:16.846
who've died of bird flu and then we have hundreds

970
00:41:16.846 --> 00:41:19.886
and thousands dying of regular flu.

971
00:41:19.886 --> 00:41:20.746
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

972
00:41:20.746 --> 00:41:23.346
<v Voiceover>So it sounds like it's here nor there</v>

973
00:41:23.346 --> 00:41:24.826
on that one.

974
00:41:24.826 --> 00:41:27.806
Unless it starts mutating.

975
00:41:27.806 --> 00:41:28.946
<v ->Right.</v>

976
00:41:30.926 --> 00:41:33.326
Yes, that's always a big possibility.

977
00:41:33.326 --> 00:41:34.406
<v Voiceover>Yes, I understand that.</v>

978
00:41:34.406 --> 00:41:36.966
I have been reading some papers on that too.

979
00:41:36.966 --> 00:41:38.148
<v ->Creative mutation I call it.</v>

980
00:41:38.148 --> 00:41:40.368
<v Voiceover>Yes, creative mutation.</v>

981
00:41:40.368 --> 00:41:44.468
So going on with the immune system and the ball-string

982
00:41:44.468 --> 00:41:45.209
of immune system.

983
00:41:45.209 --> 00:41:46.569
So we've covered three of the ways

984
00:41:46.569 --> 00:41:48.169
in which if you have a virus.

985
00:41:48.169 --> 00:41:51.089
Now just to wrap up on the ultraviolet.

986
00:41:51.089 --> 00:41:54.769
So the ultraviolet goes in and it is destroying

987
00:41:54.769 --> 00:41:56.449
the intruders.

988
00:41:56.449 --> 00:41:57.049
<v ->Correct.</v>

989
00:41:57.049 --> 00:41:58.609
<v Voiceover>And so you put that back in the body</v>

990
00:41:58.609 --> 00:42:00.629
and does it entrain the cells?

991
00:42:00.629 --> 00:42:02.869
How does that work then with ultraviolet?

992
00:42:02.869 --> 00:42:04.949
<v ->Okay, the full mechanism isn't known.</v>

993
00:42:04.949 --> 00:42:08.029
That's disturbing to the conventional medical system.

994
00:42:08.029 --> 00:42:10.049
Yale has done the bulk of the work with ultraviolet

995
00:42:10.049 --> 00:42:12.329
but they were focusing on T-cell lymphoma

996
00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:15.269
and their own device, their own instrument

997
00:42:15.269 --> 00:42:17.569
different from the Knott Hema-Irradiator.

998
00:42:17.569 --> 00:42:21.429
But when you put the blood back in the body

999
00:42:21.429 --> 00:42:23.989
there is an immunological response

1000
00:42:23.989 --> 00:42:25.569
similar to the same thing that takes place

1001
00:42:25.569 --> 00:42:28.209
when you return the ozonated blood to the body.

1002
00:42:28.209 --> 00:42:30.549
The body does amount in immune response.

1003
00:42:30.549 --> 00:42:33.929
I would like to state here.

1004
00:42:33.929 --> 00:42:36.649
There were some 40 papers published

1005
00:42:36.649 --> 00:42:38.969
in the conventional medical literature

1006
00:42:38.969 --> 00:42:41.970
over about a 30-year period of ultraviolet,

1007
00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:43.590
and this is in the standard medical journals,

1008
00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:45.050
The American Journal of Surgery,

1009
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:48.870
Review of Gastroenterology and this is not one or two cases,

1010
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:51.890
this is hundreds of cases, well-documented.

1011
00:42:54.031 --> 00:42:56.591
I mean, it's obviously had worked consistently.

1012
00:42:56.591 --> 00:43:00.051
And what you see with respect to say bacterial infection,

1013
00:43:01.532 --> 00:43:02.772
the body has a high fever

1014
00:43:02.772 --> 00:43:04.532
with a bacterial infection obviously

1015
00:43:04.532 --> 00:43:06.232
and high white blood cell count.

1016
00:43:06.232 --> 00:43:08.792
And over a 24-hour period after a treatment

1017
00:43:08.792 --> 00:43:11.212
these parameters come back to normal,

1018
00:43:11.212 --> 00:43:13.612
to a reference range and it's very consistent.

1019
00:43:13.612 --> 00:43:15.952
<v Voiceover>You brought up two other diseases earlier</v>

1020
00:43:15.952 --> 00:43:18.372
which are hepatitis and herpes.

1021
00:43:18.372 --> 00:43:21.072
If you were to take someone in, just kinda run of the mill,

1022
00:43:21.072 --> 00:43:23.052
let's just take an average, how many treatments

1023
00:43:23.052 --> 00:43:26.592
would it normally take, for example say, for herpes simplex?

1024
00:43:26.592 --> 00:43:28.592
<v ->Okay, herpes simplex, it's difficult.</v>

1025
00:43:28.592 --> 00:43:32.052
'Cause everyone's an individual.

1026
00:43:32.052 --> 00:43:34.572
My best case scenario was six treatments.

1027
00:43:34.572 --> 00:43:36.772
That would be a very best case.

1028
00:43:36.772 --> 00:43:38.072
I would say probably an average

1029
00:43:38.072 --> 00:43:40.822
will be closer to 10 to 15, maybe even 20.

1030
00:43:43.032 --> 00:43:44.612
<v Voiceover>And then that's though, they're done?</v>

1031
00:43:44.612 --> 00:43:47.272
<v ->Yes, if this is providing, it does work</v>

1032
00:43:47.272 --> 00:43:49.352
with that individual at that point in time.

1033
00:43:49.352 --> 00:43:52.462
I have had people, I've had to treat numerous,

1034
00:43:54.412 --> 00:43:57.112
I wanna say a series if you will.

1035
00:43:57.112 --> 00:44:01.852
And a lot of the work, specifically the work done with ozone

1036
00:44:01.852 --> 00:44:04.872
and herpes has been done by Dr. Heinz Konrad

1037
00:44:04.872 --> 00:44:06.392
in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

1038
00:44:06.392 --> 00:44:10.972
And he's published most to the papers and it does work.

1039
00:44:12.713 --> 00:44:14.053
As a doctor, I use the phrase,

1040
00:44:14.053 --> 00:44:16.453
I cannot use the C word, the cure word,

1041
00:44:16.453 --> 00:44:18.413
so let's just say that the person

1042
00:44:18.413 --> 00:44:19.753
who comes back non-detectable

1043
00:44:19.753 --> 00:44:22.153
and they remain so for X number of years.

1044
00:44:22.153 --> 00:44:27.093
With like that and with hepatitis, one can be reinfected

1045
00:44:27.093 --> 00:44:29.033
or recontaminated, if you will.

1046
00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:29.354
So that's--

1047
00:44:29.354 --> 00:44:30.554
<v Voiceover>Sure, there's always that possibility.</v>

1048
00:44:30.554 --> 00:44:32.034
What about hepatitis?

1049
00:44:32.034 --> 00:44:37.034
<v ->Hepatitis C, for example, it's epidemic/pandemic</v>

1050
00:44:37.734 --> 00:44:39.374
in this country at this point in time.

1051
00:44:39.374 --> 00:44:42.614
And my best case scenario there is 18 treatments.

1052
00:44:42.614 --> 00:44:44.414
It's a difficult virus to clear.

1053
00:44:44.414 --> 00:44:46.074
The conventional medical system will tell you

1054
00:44:46.074 --> 00:44:48.994
it's impossible for either of these viruses.

1055
00:44:48.994 --> 00:44:49.774
I mean, quite literally

1056
00:44:55.395 --> 00:44:57.515
I guess maybe a gastroenterologist or maybe a hepatologist

1057
00:44:57.515 --> 00:44:59.455
in Phoenix that I consult with

1058
00:44:59.455 --> 00:45:03.595
for critical hepatitis C patients to follow

1059
00:45:03.595 --> 00:45:04.755
in case they need to be hospitalized

1060
00:45:04.755 --> 00:45:06.355
for one reason or another.

1061
00:45:06.355 --> 00:45:08.995
And I spoke with him numerous times concerning this

1062
00:45:08.995 --> 00:45:10.415
and he said, "Well, you have to understand

1063
00:45:10.415 --> 00:45:12.875
"we cannot do what you're doing with your therapies

1064
00:45:12.875 --> 00:45:14.335
"and conventional medicine."

1065
00:45:14.335 --> 00:45:16.576
He said, "Yes, interfere on work's okay,"

1066
00:45:16.576 --> 00:45:18.176
but he said, "It's really not a good thing to use

1067
00:45:18.176 --> 00:45:19.976
"because of the damage it does to the body."

1068
00:45:19.976 --> 00:45:22.536
But it's all the conventional system has.

1069
00:45:22.536 --> 00:45:23.836
So from his view point, he said,

1070
00:45:23.836 --> 00:45:25.876
"What you're doing is impossible,"

1071
00:45:25.876 --> 00:45:27.316
so keep that in mind.

1072
00:45:27.316 --> 00:45:29.536
Even though I only have maybe half a dozen

1073
00:45:29.536 --> 00:45:31.676
to a dozen cases of people I've cleared

1074
00:45:31.676 --> 00:45:33.227
and have lab work to prove it.

1075
00:45:36.998 --> 00:45:38.398
The discouragement for me has been,

1076
00:45:38.398 --> 00:45:42.398
it hasn't been as consistent as I had anticipated early on

1077
00:45:42.398 --> 00:45:44.428
but it is a difficult virus to clear.

1078
00:45:46.658 --> 00:45:49.978
<v Voiceover>How do we get these types of modalities</v>

1079
00:45:49.978 --> 00:45:53.098
into the medical system so people have access to them?

1080
00:45:53.098 --> 00:45:56.298
I mean, how many doctors around the country

1081
00:45:56.298 --> 00:45:59.068
are using these modalities in their practice?

1082
00:46:00.458 --> 00:46:03.198
I assume it's growing but is it still just a sliver

1083
00:46:03.198 --> 00:46:04.738
of a percentage, just a handful?

1084
00:46:04.738 --> 00:46:08.008
<v ->I would say, with respect to ultraviolet,</v>

1085
00:46:11.498 --> 00:46:13.898
maybe a dozen around the country.

1086
00:46:13.898 --> 00:46:14.758
I mean, seriously.

1087
00:46:17.058 --> 00:46:18.838
There's a clinic in New York or I happen to know

1088
00:46:18.838 --> 00:46:23.838
one of the nurses, male nurse, (mumbles) male nurse

1089
00:46:23.878 --> 00:46:28.358
that runs the intravenous aspect there and they do it there.

1090
00:46:28.358 --> 00:46:30.778
One clinic in Florida that's recently opened up using,

1091
00:46:30.778 --> 00:46:35.778
now the downside to this is that it really depends upon

1092
00:46:36.778 --> 00:46:39.798
the type of ultraviolet light equipment, that's crucial.

1093
00:46:39.798 --> 00:46:42.238
I mean, I will be happy to but I don't want

1094
00:46:42.238 --> 00:46:45.398
to get into the technical aspects.

1095
00:46:45.398 --> 00:46:48.598
But it's a definite fact.

1096
00:46:48.598 --> 00:46:53.278
I mean, you have a wide variance of the,

1097
00:46:53.278 --> 00:46:56.238
for example, the real key or secret of the ultraviolet

1098
00:46:56.238 --> 00:47:00.338
is its delivery system and exposure of the ultraviolet,

1099
00:47:00.338 --> 00:47:02.478
but giving the right amount of ultraviolet

1100
00:47:02.478 --> 00:47:03.938
and the right intensity.

1101
00:47:03.938 --> 00:47:05.838
Move of the machines that are currently available

1102
00:47:05.838 --> 00:47:09.898
on the market use a fluorescent light tube with very low

1103
00:47:09.898 --> 00:47:13.318
energy output and a very narrow frequency range.

1104
00:47:13.318 --> 00:47:16.018
Whereas the original instrument have relatively,

1105
00:47:16.018 --> 00:47:20.018
well it had a five times energy output greater

1106
00:47:20.018 --> 00:47:22.858
than the fluorescent type tube instruments.

1107
00:47:22.858 --> 00:47:26.478
And it had a full spectrum ultraviolet lamp,

1108
00:47:26.478 --> 00:47:29.938
it covered A, B and C ultraviolet, as well as the harmonics.

1109
00:47:29.938 --> 00:47:32.419
And to this day no one really knows exactly

1110
00:47:32.419 --> 00:47:37.419
what the single primary factor is with ultraviolet.

1111
00:47:38.099 --> 00:47:39.959
Because it does more than just kill the viruses

1112
00:47:39.959 --> 00:47:42.399
and bacteria, it enhances the blood's ability

1113
00:47:42.399 --> 00:47:45.099
to carry oxygen up to 300%.

1114
00:47:45.099 --> 00:47:47.440
This was documented by Dr. Miley (mumbles)

1115
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:49.360
on absorption value studies done in the,

1116
00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.350
probably late '40s or early '50s.

1117
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.300
<v Voiceover>So if people want to go ahead</v>

1118
00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:56.340
and explore it for themselves and find a practitioner

1119
00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:59.780
that has the original type of equipment

1120
00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:02.100
is there website, somewhere they can go

1121
00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:05.500
to check this out for themselves, start studying it?

1122
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.620
<v ->Yes.</v>

1123
00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:09.560
You can just go to the internet

1124
00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.260
and Google ultraviolet light blood irradiation.

1125
00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:15.180
And that will give you, many times bringing up

1126
00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:18.180
to either practitioners or websites.

1127
00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:22.080
If you put in ultraviolet light blood irradiation

1128
00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:26.920
Knott technique it brings you up to the reference papers

1129
00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:29.780
of the Knott Hemo-Irradiator which is the original device.

1130
00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.200
And there is a big difference.

1131
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.060
I've used the--

1132
00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:32.800
<v Voiceover>Knott Hemo.</v>

1133
00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.680
You're not saying knot you're saying K-N-O-T-T.

1134
00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.560
<v ->K-N-O-T, I'm sorry.</v>

1135
00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.980
K-N-O-T-T.

1136
00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:39.860
And the device is called a Knott Hemo-Irradiator.

1137
00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:42.660
But you could just put ultraviolet light blood irradiation

1138
00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:46.260
Knott, K-N-O-T-T, technique and it will bring it up.

1139
00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:51.260
Now there is an association, the ACAM,

1140
00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:54.580
American College for the Advancement of Medicine,

1141
00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:57.670
has been known as the chelation group if you will.

1142
00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.260
Another organization,

1143
00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:02.460
International Oxidative Medical Association,

1144
00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:04.540
which had been Dr. Charlie Farr's organization,

1145
00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:07.300
after he passed away just pretty dwindled away.

1146
00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:10.160
But the ACAM group has pretty much taken up

1147
00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.600
what the alternative therapies that the IOMA group

1148
00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:16.760
was promoting and this includes ultraviolet.

1149
00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:19.760
So the ACAM conventions or conferences,

1150
00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:22.460
you do get to see the ultraviolet equipment.

1151
00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:26.620
But I just would like to state with folks

1152
00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:29.640
that it has been my experience from having,

1153
00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:33.060
I'm sort of the beginning of the resurgence

1154
00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:36.640
of this ultraviolet equipment and the use of the procedure.

1155
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.740
I first began doing it in '93, excuse me, '94.

1156
00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:43.560
I was exposed to it in '93 and learned a bit.

1157
00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:45.820
And there is a big difference in the equipment

1158
00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:47.840
and the amount of blood is crucial.

1159
00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.420
If a person is going to use one

1160
00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:51.580
of the fluorescent tube type machines

1161
00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:54.580
with the low energy output, to me it's crucial

1162
00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:58.800
that they use at least 250, if not 300 cc's of blood.

1163
00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:02.160
Most of these instruments only use 60 cc's of blood.

1164
00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.320
It's not doing much.

1165
00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:05.180
<v Voiceover>So people are gonna have to find</v>

1166
00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:06.920
the Knott device?

1167
00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.980
<v ->Yes, well, it's kinda impossible.</v>

1168
00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:11.260
There's only one Knott machine.

1169
00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:12.800
<v Voiceover>Well they'll be able to find you, James.</v>

1170
00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.640
I hope you got some time on your hands.

1171
00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:15.540
<v ->I do, I do.</v>

1172
00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.020
And I'm not saying that to promote myself,

1173
00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:17.721
I don't mean it that way.

1174
00:50:17.721 --> 00:50:19.221
<v Voiceover>No, I know what you're saying.</v>

1175
00:50:19.221 --> 00:50:20.581
I know what you're saying.

1176
00:50:20.581 --> 00:50:24.121
So beyond that, okay, go ahead.

1177
00:50:29.661 --> 00:50:30.501
<v ->The light at the end of the tunnel</v>

1178
00:50:30.501 --> 00:50:32.421
was not oncoming freight train, okay?

1179
00:50:32.421 --> 00:50:36.461
There are people who are trying very diligently

1180
00:50:36.461 --> 00:50:41.461
to raise the monies to put together the reproduction

1181
00:50:42.321 --> 00:50:47.181
of this old equipment and reproduce it in entirety

1182
00:50:47.181 --> 00:50:49.521
with respect to the correct type of lamp

1183
00:50:49.521 --> 00:50:51.801
and delivery system.

1184
00:50:51.801 --> 00:50:53.021
That is in the works.

1185
00:50:53.021 --> 00:50:55.621
Now you're asked by how to get, or getting this out

1186
00:50:55.621 --> 00:50:58.621
to the conventional system.

1187
00:50:58.621 --> 00:51:01.921
If we can get these instruments built in time

1188
00:51:01.921 --> 00:51:06.921
before the flus or the epidemics, if you will, hit us

1189
00:51:08.061 --> 00:51:10.601
we could see the beauty of this equipment

1190
00:51:10.601 --> 00:51:13.201
with respect to helping the population.

1191
00:51:13.201 --> 00:51:17.381
So it's gonna be a bit of a nip and tuck race, if you will.

1192
00:51:17.381 --> 00:51:21.881
I mean, it wouldn't take more than probably 3 to 4 months.

1193
00:51:21.881 --> 00:51:23.421
<v Voiceover>So people need to start talking</v>

1194
00:51:23.421 --> 00:51:25.441
and demanding and asking where it is?

1195
00:51:25.441 --> 00:51:26.003
<v ->Yes.</v>

1196
00:51:26.003 --> 00:51:27.803
<v Voiceover>What about taking care of ourselves?</v>

1197
00:51:27.803 --> 00:51:30.243
If all this stuff is possibly coming down the pike,

1198
00:51:30.243 --> 00:51:33.663
how do we best take care of ourselves?

1199
00:51:33.663 --> 00:51:36.483
<v ->One of the first places in my opinion is keeping</v>

1200
00:51:36.483 --> 00:51:40.483
the adrenals, the adrenal glands, healthy and strong.

1201
00:51:40.483 --> 00:51:42.783
The reason being, the adrenals are necessary

1202
00:51:42.783 --> 00:51:45.773
for the mobilization of the immune system.

1203
00:51:47.163 --> 00:51:51.283
The factors one would look at, classically the ginsengs,

1204
00:51:52.364 --> 00:51:54.404
particularly eleutherococcus which is not technically

1205
00:51:54.404 --> 00:51:58.504
a ginseng, the Siberian ginseng is eleutherococcus,

1206
00:51:58.504 --> 00:52:01.664
the American ginsengs they all support adrenal function.

1207
00:52:01.664 --> 00:52:04.444
Classically the best way, in my opinion,

1208
00:52:04.444 --> 00:52:06.304
is using the old glandular therapies,

1209
00:52:06.304 --> 00:52:08.024
they're called protomorphogens.

1210
00:52:08.024 --> 00:52:10.724
A number of companies, and I'm not saying this

1211
00:52:10.724 --> 00:52:12.524
to advertise for these companies,

1212
00:52:12.524 --> 00:52:15.664
but I think people need the information.

1213
00:52:15.664 --> 00:52:18.384
A company called Professional Complementary Health products

1214
00:52:18.384 --> 00:52:20.964
in Portland, Oregon makes an excellent product

1215
00:52:20.964 --> 00:52:22.944
called Adrenal Complex.

1216
00:52:22.944 --> 00:52:25.764
It's patterned after Dr. Henry Harrower and Royal Lee

1217
00:52:25.764 --> 00:52:27.684
who helped put the formulations together, if you will,

1218
00:52:27.684 --> 00:52:30.164
for Standard Process company many years ago.

1219
00:52:30.164 --> 00:52:33.104
Standard Process has a very good product called,

1220
00:52:33.104 --> 00:52:36.794
I think it's Andromin but it's an adrenal support.

1221
00:52:37.604 --> 00:52:40.164
<v Voiceover>So we support the adrenals, ginseng,</v>

1222
00:52:40.164 --> 00:52:41.444
protomorphogens.

1223
00:52:41.444 --> 00:52:42.664
<v ->Protomorphogens.</v>

1224
00:52:42.664 --> 00:52:45.664
One other company, a health food store brand.

1225
00:52:45.664 --> 00:52:49.804
It's Phytopharmacos health food store brand

1226
00:52:49.804 --> 00:52:52.044
and I'm drawing a blank on that name,

1227
00:52:52.044 --> 00:52:54.824
but nonetheless they have a very good adrenal support.

1228
00:52:54.824 --> 00:52:57.525
Most of the health food source do have some adrenal support.

1229
00:52:57.525 --> 00:52:58.935
But that's crucial.

1230
00:53:01.465 --> 00:53:04.145
Addition, of course, there's the classic Echinacea

1231
00:53:04.145 --> 00:53:05.245
those sorts of things.

1232
00:53:05.245 --> 00:53:08.545
But I look at some of the more antiviral botanicals:

1233
00:53:10.026 --> 00:53:14.726
lomatium root, I don't know a common name for it,

1234
00:53:14.726 --> 00:53:19.156
(mumbles) lomatium root is antiviral.

1235
00:53:20.006 --> 00:53:20.866
Considered antiviral.

1236
00:53:20.866 --> 00:53:24.246
<v Voiceover>What about the whole notion of mushrooms?</v>

1237
00:53:24.246 --> 00:53:26.687
<v ->All the shitake, maitake.</v>

1238
00:53:26.687 --> 00:53:27.707
Yes, the reishi.

1239
00:53:27.707 --> 00:53:30.607
There are formulations that are just, generally,

1240
00:53:30.607 --> 00:53:32.537
to boost immune system in general.

1241
00:53:33.607 --> 00:53:36.047
The other powerful aspects that can keep us healthy

1242
00:53:36.047 --> 00:53:39.247
is the old hydrotherapy.

1243
00:53:39.247 --> 00:53:43.007
It comes from Father Kneipp, the water curette of Germany,

1244
00:53:43.007 --> 00:53:45.187
brought and made famous in this country,

1245
00:53:45.187 --> 00:53:47.527
primarily by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg,

1246
00:53:47.527 --> 00:53:50.787
Kellogg's battle creek, another big story.

1247
00:53:53.007 --> 00:53:56.787
Dr. Kellogg was an M.D., an eclectic M.D., if you will,

1248
00:53:56.787 --> 00:54:00.867
eclectic meaning that the M.D.'s were not approving

1249
00:54:00.867 --> 00:54:04.127
of arsenic, antimony, mercury as the medicines,

1250
00:54:04.127 --> 00:54:05.067
medicinals.

1251
00:54:05.067 --> 00:54:08.467
And most Americans don't realize those were the medicinals

1252
00:54:08.467 --> 00:54:13.467
of the AMA prior to the advent of petroleum chemistry

1253
00:54:13.567 --> 00:54:14.987
in pharmaceuticals.

1254
00:54:14.987 --> 00:54:16.890
<v Voiceover>On arsenic and--</v>
<v ->On arsenic.</v>

1255
00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:19.410
The eclectic physicians, the eclectic M.D.'s

1256
00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:22.910
used herbal medicine and hydrotherapy nutrition.

1257
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:25.950
<v Voiceover>So hydrotherapy meaning taking a bath?</v>

1258
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:26.850
<v ->Taking a bath.</v>

1259
00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:27.550
<v Voiceover>Hot baths?</v>

1260
00:54:27.550 --> 00:54:28.270
<v ->Hot and cold.</v>

1261
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:30.670
Hot and cold.

1262
00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:32.430
Simply what you do is you heat the body up

1263
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:35.510
as hot as one can tolerate.

1264
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:38.350
Sauna, steam, Jacuzzi, I don't care how it's done.

1265
00:54:38.350 --> 00:54:41.310
15 minutes approximately, come out, cold shower,

1266
00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:42.570
cold tub.

1267
00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:44.510
I prefer the plunge tubs.

1268
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:49.170
It seems to be a more potent treatment, if you will.

1269
00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:51.530
<v Voiceover>That really kicks the immune system into gear,</v>

1270
00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:52.090
doesn't it?

1271
00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:52.870
<v ->Very strongly.</v>

1272
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:53.850
It helps everything.

1273
00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:57.290
It helps the immune system, helps digestion,

1274
00:54:57.290 --> 00:54:59.830
helps just general cleansing of the body

1275
00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:03.190
and helps the kidney to excrete the toxins

1276
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:04.190
and the waste products.

1277
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:06.551
In school, we used to do test on folks

1278
00:55:06.551 --> 00:55:09.191
prior to hydrotherapy and post.

1279
00:55:09.191 --> 00:55:10.951
And it's just a powerful treatment.

1280
00:55:10.951 --> 00:55:12.531
And simply you just have to be in the cold water

1281
00:55:12.531 --> 00:55:14.231
for one minute, it doesn't have to be long

1282
00:55:14.231 --> 00:55:17.351
and doesn't have to be super cold.

1283
00:55:17.351 --> 00:55:19.452
<v Voiceover>Just enough to give them a jolt.</v>

1284
00:55:19.452 --> 00:55:23.292
<v ->Most people 55 degree would be plenty cold enough.</v>

1285
00:55:23.292 --> 00:55:26.132
50 degrees is as far as one needs to go.

1286
00:55:26.132 --> 00:55:28.292
I've been in 38 degrees and it's what I call

1287
00:55:28.292 --> 00:55:30.172
the law of diminishing return.

1288
00:55:30.172 --> 00:55:32.032
You don't get any greater benefit in that cold.

1289
00:55:32.032 --> 00:55:33.092
There really is not.

1290
00:55:33.092 --> 00:55:35.312
<v Voiceover>I did a dive one time in 39 degree water,</v>

1291
00:55:35.312 --> 00:55:37.352
it was absolute ice on the beach.

1292
00:55:37.352 --> 00:55:38.352
And yeah, you don't need that.

1293
00:55:38.352 --> 00:55:39.412
You'll lose consciousness.

1294
00:55:39.412 --> 00:55:41.972
Okay, so we have hydrotherapy: hot, cold.

1295
00:55:41.972 --> 00:55:43.052
<v ->Hot and cold.</v>

1296
00:55:43.052 --> 00:55:44.292
<v Voiceover>What else?</v>

1297
00:55:44.292 --> 00:55:45.572
<v ->Basically, let's see, what else can we do?</v>

1298
00:55:45.572 --> 00:55:47.574
Well of course vitamin C.

1299
00:55:47.574 --> 00:55:49.554
Linus Pauling.

1300
00:55:49.554 --> 00:55:53.354
I recommend 1,000 milligrams per hour

1301
00:55:53.354 --> 00:55:54.964
during the waking hours.

1302
00:55:56.914 --> 00:55:58.114
<v Voiceover>When you're sick or just in a day?</v>

1303
00:55:58.114 --> 00:55:58.814
<v ->In general.</v>

1304
00:55:58.814 --> 00:55:59.974
<v Voiceover>In general, okay.</v>

1305
00:55:59.974 --> 00:56:04.974
<v ->And when one is ill that's also been the dose,</v>

1306
00:56:06.294 --> 00:56:07.874
1,000 milligrams an hour.

1307
00:56:07.874 --> 00:56:10.874
But we and guinea pigs are the only two mammals

1308
00:56:10.874 --> 00:56:13.094
that don't make some vitamin C.

1309
00:56:13.094 --> 00:56:14.314
I can't remember.

1310
00:56:14.314 --> 00:56:17.354
I wanna say whales do like a gram per thousand pounds

1311
00:56:17.354 --> 00:56:19.434
or something or 10,000, I don't know what it is,

1312
00:56:19.434 --> 00:56:20.694
but it's a lot.

1313
00:56:20.694 --> 00:56:22.534
<v Voiceover>So vitamin C.</v>

1314
00:56:22.534 --> 00:56:25.794
So we've got kicking up the adrenals,

1315
00:56:25.794 --> 00:56:28.014
we have, how do you say it?

1316
00:56:28.014 --> 00:56:28.635
Lomacasium?

1317
00:56:28.635 --> 00:56:29.195
<v ->Lomatium.</v>

1318
00:56:29.195 --> 00:56:30.415
<v Voiceover>Lomatium root?</v>

1319
00:56:30.415 --> 00:56:30.715
<v ->Yes.</v>

1320
00:56:30.715 --> 00:56:33.595
<v Voiceover>We have hydrotherapy, we have vitamin C.</v>

1321
00:56:33.595 --> 00:56:34.915
Anything else to toss in the bag

1322
00:56:34.915 --> 00:56:36.155
because we're almost out of time.

1323
00:56:36.155 --> 00:56:38.516
<v ->I'm trying to think of what else we can do.</v>

1324
00:56:38.516 --> 00:56:40.456
In general, like echinacea of course,

1325
00:56:40.456 --> 00:56:43.496
the general immune herbal medicine astragalus,

1326
00:56:43.496 --> 00:56:45.596
just to keep the immune system boosted.

1327
00:56:45.596 --> 00:56:48.456
But I pretty much contend that hydrotherapy,

1328
00:56:48.456 --> 00:56:50.076
well as a person's exercise

1329
00:56:50.076 --> 00:56:52.216
because if you exercise aerobically

1330
00:56:52.216 --> 00:56:54.376
you're going to have the oxygen onboard

1331
00:56:54.376 --> 00:56:56.676
to make the peroxides in the white blood cells.

1332
00:56:56.676 --> 00:56:58.876
So it's kind of a catch 22 again.

1333
00:56:58.876 --> 00:57:01.716
<v Voiceover>And I guess the standard stuff.</v>

1334
00:57:01.716 --> 00:57:03.816
If we reduce the amount of white foods and toxins

1335
00:57:03.816 --> 00:57:05.256
that we take into our body.

1336
00:57:05.256 --> 00:57:07.416
So that's a given.

1337
00:57:07.416 --> 00:57:10.656
So just to kinda wrap it up, any other final comments

1338
00:57:10.656 --> 00:57:13.716
you have on all of this in terms of just taking care

1339
00:57:13.716 --> 00:57:16.496
of ourselves in these toxic times.

1340
00:57:16.496 --> 00:57:19.396
<v ->I think one of the biggest benefits that people will have</v>

1341
00:57:19.396 --> 00:57:24.396
is to not allow the stresses of the world, as best one can,

1342
00:57:24.496 --> 00:57:28.336
to affect our mental state in the form of depression

1343
00:57:28.336 --> 00:57:31.376
or anxiety and fear because this suppresses

1344
00:57:31.376 --> 00:57:32.736
the immune system.

1345
00:57:32.736 --> 00:57:35.016
I'm not saying bury the head in the sand.

1346
00:57:35.016 --> 00:57:39.436
But when one supports the adrenals and just face this

1347
00:57:39.436 --> 00:57:41.216
we're in exciting times.

1348
00:57:41.216 --> 00:57:43.256
I mean, it'd be quite the kind of excitement we want

1349
00:57:43.256 --> 00:57:47.176
but to keep the body strong and the mind crisp,

1350
00:57:47.176 --> 00:57:50.406
and keep the mind as relaxed as possible.

1351
00:57:51.596 --> 00:57:52.456
<v Voiceover>That makes good sense.</v>

1352
00:57:52.456 --> 00:57:53.476
Thank you so much.

1353
00:57:53.476 --> 00:57:54.036
<v ->You're welcome.</v>

1354
00:57:54.036 --> 00:57:56.096
<v Voiceover>We have about one minute left, so thank you.</v>

1355
00:57:56.096 --> 00:57:57.576
I appreciate your time--

1356
00:57:57.576 --> 00:57:58.136
<v ->You're welcome.</v>

1357
00:57:58.136 --> 00:57:59.077
<v Voiceover>And I know you're a busy man.</v>

1358
00:57:59.077 --> 00:58:00.317
<v ->This was fun.</v>

1359
00:58:00.317 --> 00:58:01.557
Thank you very much.

1360
00:58:01.557 --> 00:58:04.057
(ambient music)

1361
00:58:04.057 --> 00:58:06.477
<v ->Because Dr. Hutton is such a font of information</v>

1362
00:58:06.477 --> 00:58:08.717
regarding the world of medicine and healing,

1363
00:58:08.717 --> 00:58:10.537
we've provided a reading list below

1364
00:58:10.537 --> 00:58:13.077
so you can check in to some of the sources he mentions

1365
00:58:13.077 --> 00:58:14.217
in this interview.

1366
00:58:14.217 --> 00:58:16.257
Also, you might want to watch our interviews

1367
00:58:16.257 --> 00:58:18.637
with Dr. Lorraine Day and Burton Goldberg

1368
00:58:18.637 --> 00:58:20.357
for related information.

1369
00:58:20.357 --> 00:58:21.337
Until next time.

1370
00:58:21.337 --> 00:58:22.707
Thanks for watching.
