(gentle piano music playing)

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:17.039
<v ->Our time at the Edgar Cayce Institute</v>

3
00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.978
provided a gold mine of information,

4
00:00:18.978 --> 00:00:22.310
including useful knowledge on the mind body connection.

5
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.085
Dawn Hogue has been fascinated with Cayce's work

6
00:00:25.085 --> 00:00:27.651
since her teenage years, and she has devoted herself

7
00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:30.089
to the path through healing massage.

8
00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.852
As a psychotherapist, Dawn easily incorporated her

9
00:00:32.852 --> 00:00:36.126
understanding of the mind body connection to her body work.

10
00:00:36.126 --> 00:00:38.355
Today, she is a teacher and administrator

11
00:00:38.355 --> 00:00:41.522
at the Cayce Reilly School of Massotherapy.

12
00:00:41.522 --> 00:00:44.529
Applying Edgar Cayce's readings and healing techniques,

13
00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:47.060
Dawn brings a detailed look into some of the ways

14
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.182
we can heal ourselves and each other.

15
00:00:51.182 --> 00:00:54.066
Dawn, what intrigued you initially about

16
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.027
coming here for your education?

17
00:00:56.027 --> 00:00:57.782
There are a lot of places you can go

18
00:00:57.782 --> 00:01:02.148
for an education as a healer, psychotherapist and so forth.

19
00:01:02.148 --> 00:01:07.148
What was it that drew you to the Cayce Institute?

20
00:01:07.256 --> 00:01:08.591
<v ->A few different things.</v>

21
00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:10.959
It was a combination of different factors.

22
00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:13.397
I had some friends that had gone to school here,

23
00:01:13.397 --> 00:01:16.694
so I knew from their experience a little bit of what it

24
00:01:16.694 --> 00:01:21.559
was like, but it really started when I was about 19 or 20

25
00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:22.801
and a friend of mine gave me

26
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:26.179
a book of Edgar Cayce on dreams.

27
00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.513
That was my first introduction to Cayce

28
00:01:28.513 --> 00:01:32.646
and learning about the aspect of interpreting

29
00:01:32.646 --> 00:01:35.049
your dreams for personal growth.

30
00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.942
I then got into some of his material

31
00:01:36.942 --> 00:01:39.357
on attitudes and emotions,

32
00:01:39.357 --> 00:01:40.887
and it just resonated with me.

33
00:01:40.887 --> 00:01:43.255
You know how when you read something that

34
00:01:43.255 --> 00:01:47.597
you just get, it was like that ah ha.

35
00:01:47.597 --> 00:01:49.896
Funny enough, I was living on 89th street, so within

36
00:01:49.896 --> 00:01:54.469
20 blocks, basically in my backyard was this gym.

37
00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.198
<v Regina>You were right here already.</v>

38
00:01:56.198 --> 00:01:59.143
I can remember so distinctly, it was 1996

39
00:01:59.143 --> 00:02:03.799
walking up the patio outside and just having that knowing,

40
00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.048
that sense of yes, this is where I'm supposed to be.

41
00:02:08.048 --> 00:02:11.555
It was definitely a series of serendipitous events

42
00:02:11.555 --> 00:02:14.620
and coincidences that enabled me to come to school here

43
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.583
for massage therapy back then.

44
00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:23.109
Here I am 16 years later.

45
00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.604
<v Regina>Now you are really the back bone</v>

46
00:02:25.604 --> 00:02:27.364
of this school in a lot of senses.

47
00:02:27.364 --> 00:02:30.871
<v ->Yeah, we have a team, certainly, of administrative staff</v>

48
00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:33.378
and faculty that are outstanding

49
00:02:33.378 --> 00:02:35.770
that really make the school what it is.

50
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.009
I am really proud to be involved in the structure

51
00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:41.517
that helps facilitate that learning

52
00:02:41.517 --> 00:02:44.025
and that growth experience for other people.

53
00:02:44.025 --> 00:02:46.718
It's very rewarding and I wouldn't be

54
00:02:46.718 --> 00:02:48.228
anywhere else doing this.

55
00:02:48.228 --> 00:02:50.923
<v Regina>I can imagine. The energy here is just sublime.</v>

56
00:02:50.923 --> 00:02:54.288
Here we are really just very close to the ocean,

57
00:02:54.288 --> 00:02:57.098
the beaches, just across the way here.

58
00:02:57.098 --> 00:03:00.975
That was by design back in the '20s

59
00:03:00.975 --> 00:03:03.843
when Edgar got the idea that if he was going to start

60
00:03:03.843 --> 00:03:06.374
helping others facilitate their healing in the

61
00:03:06.374 --> 00:03:09.509
proper environment, that it had to be done near the ocean.

62
00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:12.318
Can you talk a little bit about what his thoughts were

63
00:03:12.318 --> 00:03:14.882
on that when this was established.

64
00:03:14.882 --> 00:03:17.958
<v ->One thing that I know that stands out for me the most</v>

65
00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.628
that really connects in with some of the physical healing

66
00:03:20.628 --> 00:03:22.428
and health principals in the readings

67
00:03:22.428 --> 00:03:26.793
is that it was said that the sand here in Virginia Beach

68
00:03:26.793 --> 00:03:30.404
had mineral properties that were very healing.

69
00:03:30.404 --> 00:03:34.966
There was known to be gold, aspects of gold in the sand,

70
00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:38.368
and one of the therapies that we teach are sand packs,

71
00:03:38.368 --> 00:03:41.131
where you actually bury yourself in the sand

72
00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:42.884
and there's a certain method and procedure

73
00:03:42.884 --> 00:03:45.845
that you follow, but it's really powerful to see

74
00:03:45.845 --> 00:03:49.514
what kind of detox can come just from lying in

75
00:03:49.514 --> 00:03:52.045
this particular sand here.

76
00:03:52.045 --> 00:03:54.622
<v Regina>Interesting, so even if you're a patient</v>

77
00:03:54.622 --> 00:03:57.954
and you were mobile, Scott and I have a few more days here,

78
00:03:57.954 --> 00:03:59.034
(laughing)

79
00:03:59.034 --> 00:04:02.935
just even taking walks in the sand along the water line

80
00:04:02.935 --> 00:04:05.532
and lying in the sand in itself,

81
00:04:05.532 --> 00:04:08.269
can you talk about, you were talking about detox,

82
00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.057
what other things happen when you're lying

83
00:04:10.057 --> 00:04:13.447
in this kind of sand in particular.

84
00:04:13.447 --> 00:04:18.447
<v ->It is primarily the detox from,</v>

85
00:04:18.848 --> 00:04:22.328
I guess it depends on what

86
00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:24.325
symptoms you're experiencing in your body,

87
00:04:24.325 --> 00:04:27.285
but what I can tell you is that when people

88
00:04:27.285 --> 00:04:30.792
get up from the sand, there's usually,

89
00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:33.334
this sounds kind of ick, but there's usually

90
00:04:33.334 --> 00:04:36.367
a ring of black that's left

91
00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:37.698
where the person was lying.
<v Regina>Kind of like those</v>

92
00:04:37.698 --> 00:04:38.768
ionic foot baths.

93
00:04:38.768 --> 00:04:40.300
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

94
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.002
You can see where your body has sweated and sweated out

95
00:04:45.002 --> 00:04:48.346
some of the superficial toxins that are there, but certainly

96
00:04:48.346 --> 00:04:51.051
that's having a deeper impact on your body, also.

97
00:04:51.051 --> 00:04:52.178
<v Regina>That's interesting, I didn't mean to</v>

98
00:04:52.178 --> 00:04:55.246
side track you there, but I find that fascinating.

99
00:04:55.246 --> 00:04:57.722
Also, there's something about the negative ions,

100
00:04:57.722 --> 00:04:59.487
and Cayce was looking at this

101
00:04:59.487 --> 00:05:01.948
from a very whole point of view.

102
00:05:01.948 --> 00:05:05.930
Let's go into your education and being educated

103
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.287
here versus another massage school, for example.

104
00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:11.386
Also, your work in psychotherapy

105
00:05:11.386 --> 00:05:13.484
and the mind body connection, because that's really

106
00:05:13.484 --> 00:05:16.629
that's your thing, the mind body emotional connection

107
00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:18.440
and also dreams.

108
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.576
Let's really get into more of your specialty

109
00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:23.618
and what you learned through Cayce's teachings,

110
00:05:23.618 --> 00:05:26.219
and then I'd like to know how you've carried that forward

111
00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:28.552
and some case examples of your own

112
00:05:28.552 --> 00:05:31.606
that you have seen applied that have just really been

113
00:05:31.606 --> 00:05:34.323
borderline miraculous from the average person's

114
00:05:34.323 --> 00:05:36.691
point of view.

115
00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:39.410
<v ->I'm so happy to be able to share.</v>

116
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.551
Like I said, I chose this school because I just knew.

117
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:44.397
I had that intuitive knowing.

118
00:05:44.397 --> 00:05:46.997
The name of our program, School of Massotherapy,

119
00:05:46.997 --> 00:05:49.435
is unique, that's a unique term for us here,

120
00:05:49.435 --> 00:05:53.313
that really describes that healing art aspect

121
00:05:53.313 --> 00:05:55.541
of massage therapy.

122
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:58.712
What I wanted and what I got from my studies here

123
00:05:58.712 --> 00:06:01.321
was not just the techniques of massage

124
00:06:01.321 --> 00:06:03.085
or the technical side of it,

125
00:06:03.085 --> 00:06:06.893
but how to be present with another person,

126
00:06:06.893 --> 00:06:11.167
how to be centered myself

127
00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:15.363
so that I could be of better service to another person,

128
00:06:15.363 --> 00:06:18.463
how to put my hands on someone with sensitivity

129
00:06:18.463 --> 00:06:23.463
and with that awareness of a prayerful, mindful attitude,

130
00:06:23.606 --> 00:06:25.579
to be a channel of healing.

131
00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:28.447
That's really mentioned in the readings so frequently

132
00:06:28.447 --> 00:06:32.011
and something that is a big aspect of our training,

133
00:06:32.011 --> 00:06:34.415
is that we are channels of healing

134
00:06:34.415 --> 00:06:36.957
for this person that we're working with.

135
00:06:36.957 --> 00:06:40.254
That's so precious to me still to this day,

136
00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:43.656
is that that healing comes through me, a universal healing.

137
00:06:43.656 --> 00:06:46.663
These principles of universal healing,

138
00:06:46.663 --> 00:06:50.901
being a channel of blessings, being centered

139
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:54.175
and grounded and present, just really resonated

140
00:06:54.175 --> 00:06:57.135
with I guess my temperment.

141
00:06:57.135 --> 00:07:01.779
I had always been pretty contemplative by nature

142
00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:04.810
and a person who really reflected on herself.

143
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.017
I think that's part of what really interested me

144
00:07:07.017 --> 00:07:10.956
about dreams, is that it gave me this other aspect

145
00:07:10.956 --> 00:07:15.693
to reflect upon myself and learn about which direction

146
00:07:15.693 --> 00:07:19.164
I should go in life and maybe even get some insights

147
00:07:19.164 --> 00:07:20.894
in to what could be to come.

148
00:07:20.894 --> 00:07:23.762
I have had a few of those myself, prophetic dreams

149
00:07:23.762 --> 00:07:25.666
I guess you'd call them.

150
00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:27.674
Very powerful, I still remember some of them

151
00:07:27.674 --> 00:07:30.705
from years and years ago.

152
00:07:30.705 --> 00:07:33.642
That is a big part of what drew me here.

153
00:07:33.642 --> 00:07:37.879
As I got to work with clients more and more

154
00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:42.879
I started to really notice patterns of tension and holding

155
00:07:42.953 --> 00:07:46.541
in their bodies that sometimes corresponded

156
00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:48.723
with what they would share with me was going on

157
00:07:48.723 --> 00:07:50.325
in their lives.

158
00:07:50.325 --> 00:07:53.876
I knew from my own self, too, where

159
00:07:53.876 --> 00:07:56.070
I might hold in my neck and shoulders

160
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.403
what that had to do with, for example,

161
00:07:58.403 --> 00:08:01.201
how I moved forward in life.

162
00:08:01.201 --> 00:08:06.201
How I looked at life and those types of metaphorical themes.

163
00:08:08.214 --> 00:08:12.115
Again, the more experience I got working with clients,

164
00:08:12.115 --> 00:08:15.679
I just grew more and more interested in really exploring

165
00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:18.012
that mind body connection.

166
00:08:18.012 --> 00:08:23.012
How can we use our attitudes, our behaviors, our emotions

167
00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:28.121
to heal, bring healing, or support healing to our bodies,

168
00:08:28.287 --> 00:08:31.596
to use out thoughts constructively as opposed to

169
00:08:31.596 --> 00:08:36.596
destructively, as is mentioned in reference in the readings.

170
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.475
<v Regina>There are 14,000 readings, so it's not as though</v>

171
00:08:40.475 --> 00:08:43.110
there's a lack of guidance here.

172
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.280
Are there very specific correlations in those readings

173
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.020
that you studied having to do with, for example,

174
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.620
your neck and shoulders, about moving forward,

175
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:56.555
about heart conditions, what has generally impacted

176
00:08:56.555 --> 00:09:00.061
that part of the body through the mind and the emotions.

177
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:03.428
Can you give us a bit of a portrait of the human body

178
00:09:03.428 --> 00:09:08.428
and common or chronic ailments and the correlative emotions

179
00:09:08.467 --> 00:09:11.578
and mindsets so we can have a little takeaway here.

180
00:09:11.578 --> 00:09:13.064
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

181
00:09:13.064 --> 00:09:15.502
I can certainly give you some insight into that

182
00:09:15.502 --> 00:09:17.011
and at the same time,

183
00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:20.216
I really try not to be so deterministic.

184
00:09:20.216 --> 00:09:22.050
<v Regina>Yes, one size fits all.</v>

185
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.082
<v ->Every person is so unique and individual, that's right.</v>

186
00:09:24.082 --> 00:09:26.357
They're just generals to keep in mind,

187
00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:30.723
but not to ascribe as a definite to people.

188
00:09:30.723 --> 00:09:33.788
Cayce mentioned quite a bit, not so much in the readings

189
00:09:33.788 --> 00:09:37.236
about attitudes and emotions having to do with

190
00:09:37.236 --> 00:09:40.173
certain body postures or whatnot,

191
00:09:40.173 --> 00:09:43.505
but he did mention a lot about the mental drosses,

192
00:09:43.505 --> 00:09:47.174
if you will, or the things that get bogged down in our minds

193
00:09:47.174 --> 00:09:51.307
and emotions that can lead to the physical drosses

194
00:09:51.307 --> 00:09:53.409
and build up in the system.

195
00:09:53.409 --> 00:09:55.917
He talked more generally in that way,

196
00:09:55.917 --> 00:09:58.656
but some of my other studies that I've done

197
00:09:58.656 --> 00:10:01.385
with Cayce and since have shown me that

198
00:10:01.385 --> 00:10:05.193
often times the upper body, the neck and shoulders,

199
00:10:05.193 --> 00:10:09.001
do reflect how we move forward in life.

200
00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:12.972
If someone has a posture where their head is a bit forward

201
00:10:12.972 --> 00:10:16.482
from the rest of their body, their leading with

202
00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:21.212
a little bit of intensity, and the head and the mind moreso

203
00:10:21.212 --> 00:10:25.113
than kind of being aligned in their body.

204
00:10:25.113 --> 00:10:26.854
<v Regina>That would be indicating they're more</v>

205
00:10:26.854 --> 00:10:28.050
in their heads a lot.

206
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:32.494
What about someone who has kind of a slumped?

207
00:10:32.494 --> 00:10:35.535
<v ->That kind of rounded shoulders and slumped</v>

208
00:10:35.535 --> 00:10:40.332
can sometimes correlate with fear, certainly someone that

209
00:10:40.332 --> 00:10:44.199
has maybe developed some insecurities in their life

210
00:10:44.199 --> 00:10:48.007
and they're just afraid of opening their heart

211
00:10:48.007 --> 00:10:53.007
and living from a place of openness and trust.

212
00:10:54.449 --> 00:10:57.211
We're in an area where there's a lot of military

213
00:10:57.211 --> 00:11:00.578
and of course we appreciate all they do for our country,

214
00:11:00.578 --> 00:11:03.956
but you'll notice a typical posture in a lot of military

215
00:11:03.956 --> 00:11:05.756
that the chest is out.

216
00:11:05.756 --> 00:11:10.493
Sometimes that can reveal a false bravado,

217
00:11:10.493 --> 00:11:15.427
leading from that place of authority, again as opposed to

218
00:11:15.427 --> 00:11:19.168
a balance within the body of

219
00:11:19.168 --> 00:11:24.168
that heart within a confidence that one can have.

220
00:11:24.172 --> 00:11:26.970
Legs and lower body generally represent how

221
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.037
we move through life,

222
00:11:29.037 --> 00:11:31.776
and sometimes relate to can we step forward

223
00:11:31.776 --> 00:11:36.776
into that next step or do we stay stuck where we are.

224
00:11:37.489 --> 00:11:39.614
Those types of themes.

225
00:11:39.614 --> 00:11:41.886
<v Regina>Hips, for example, so many people</v>

226
00:11:41.886 --> 00:11:44.162
have problems with hips it seems.

227
00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:47.758
<v ->Hips and low back often correspond to that security.</v>

228
00:11:47.758 --> 00:11:49.464
The hips and low back are associated

229
00:11:49.464 --> 00:11:52.564
with those lower chakras of security

230
00:11:52.564 --> 00:11:54.700
and when we first come into the world,

231
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.299
and that innate sense of I am okay.

232
00:11:58.299 --> 00:12:00.912
Sometimes when there's stiffness or stuckness

233
00:12:00.912 --> 00:12:03.547
or tension in the hips and low back,

234
00:12:03.547 --> 00:12:08.354
it could relate to some issues of questioning that

235
00:12:08.354 --> 00:12:13.354
or not feeling secure in how we're connected in the earth

236
00:12:13.787 --> 00:12:17.022
and to our life experiences.

237
00:12:17.022 --> 00:12:18.494
<v Regina>When you're talking about the lower part</v>

238
00:12:18.494 --> 00:12:20.955
of the body, does that continue on to the feet?

239
00:12:20.955 --> 00:12:24.299
Do the feet have specific information they convey?

240
00:12:24.299 --> 00:12:29.299
<v ->It definitely goes from the hips to the knees to the feet.</v>

241
00:12:30.799 --> 00:12:34.872
Injuries related to the knees can definitely be associated

242
00:12:34.872 --> 00:12:38.344
with again, how am I moving forward in life.

243
00:12:38.344 --> 00:12:43.057
Feet are more about how am I grounded in life,

244
00:12:43.057 --> 00:12:47.516
am I securely grounded and planted here where I am,

245
00:12:47.516 --> 00:12:51.962
or are there compromises that I'm making in terms of

246
00:12:51.962 --> 00:12:54.900
how connected I can be to the earth

247
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.558
and to each step that I'm taking.

248
00:12:57.558 --> 00:12:59.799
<v Regina>I assume if you extend that to people</v>

249
00:12:59.799 --> 00:13:03.038
who stumble a lot, right?

250
00:13:03.038 --> 00:13:05.441
If someone came in and hurt themselves

251
00:13:05.441 --> 00:13:07.171
and tweaked their back out and their knee

252
00:13:07.171 --> 00:13:10.778
and twisted their ankle because they stumbled

253
00:13:10.778 --> 00:13:12.985
because of whatever, what would be the first thing

254
00:13:12.985 --> 00:13:15.214
you'd start asking or looking at, for example?

255
00:13:15.214 --> 00:13:17.584
<v ->I might just say, so tell me about what's going on</v>

256
00:13:17.584 --> 00:13:19.616
in your life and is this a pattern?

257
00:13:19.616 --> 00:13:21.543
That would be the first thing I would ask,

258
00:13:21.543 --> 00:13:24.724
is this a pattern that you notice in yourself?

259
00:13:24.724 --> 00:13:26.489
Are you always injuring your knee?

260
00:13:26.489 --> 00:13:28.660
Is it the same knee?

261
00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.365
Then we'd look at, okay, is it the right or left side

262
00:13:31.365 --> 00:13:35.034
and what some of those associations might have to do with.

263
00:13:35.034 --> 00:13:37.542
I really, again, just try to be open ended

264
00:13:37.542 --> 00:13:40.038
when I'm talking to clients and really get information

265
00:13:40.038 --> 00:13:42.540
from them and ask questions

266
00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.152
that kind of reveal their own ah ha's

267
00:13:45.152 --> 00:13:47.021
about connections that it could have

268
00:13:47.021 --> 00:13:49.657
to maybe some beliefs that they're holding

269
00:13:49.657 --> 00:13:54.486
or just some issues that are not supporting them.

270
00:13:54.486 --> 00:13:56.553
<v Regina>So often people just tend to look at these things</v>

271
00:13:56.553 --> 00:13:59.953
as random, bu they're not just random.

272
00:13:59.953 --> 00:14:02.766
If you don't mind, we'll just continue a little bit further.

273
00:14:02.766 --> 00:14:04.531
Let's talk about the heart.

274
00:14:04.531 --> 00:14:06.331
If we look at the heart and then maybe

275
00:14:06.331 --> 00:14:09.373
the digestive system or elimination system,

276
00:14:09.373 --> 00:14:12.841
what are those things indicating as a rule?

277
00:14:12.841 --> 00:14:17.218
<v ->The heart is definitely how we embrace life.</v>

278
00:14:17.218 --> 00:14:20.013
Do we have a trusting heart and spirit

279
00:14:20.013 --> 00:14:22.811
that we feel that we can be open and embrace,

280
00:14:22.811 --> 00:14:27.522
or is there a way at which we even subtlety sometimes

281
00:14:27.522 --> 00:14:32.522
retract and pull back from really expressing our love,

282
00:14:34.198 --> 00:14:38.598
expressing our fears, expressing our emotions.

283
00:14:38.598 --> 00:14:43.598
The heart is really connected with that emotional security,

284
00:14:43.671 --> 00:14:47.839
as well as the gut, the digestive system.

285
00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:52.066
Cayce readings really, a lot goes back

286
00:14:52.066 --> 00:14:55.847
to the digestive system, a lot goes back to the gut

287
00:14:55.847 --> 00:15:00.847
and the assimilation of foods, of attitudes, of events.

288
00:15:02.987 --> 00:15:05.355
At the very basic foundation,

289
00:15:05.355 --> 00:15:09.570
does our digestive system assimilate properly,

290
00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:14.133
meaning can it digest and get rid of what it doesn't need?

291
00:15:14.133 --> 00:15:18.742
Or does it hold onto things for fear

292
00:15:18.742 --> 00:15:23.742
or whatever the more esoteric reasons might be.

293
00:15:24.883 --> 00:15:26.486
<v Regina>One of the observations I've had,</v>

294
00:15:26.486 --> 00:15:29.713
and again, these are broad strokes,

295
00:15:29.713 --> 00:15:33.788
is that the men I've observed in life versus the women,

296
00:15:33.788 --> 00:15:35.994
the women seem to hold on a lot more

297
00:15:35.994 --> 00:15:38.490
and have more issues with their digestive

298
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.986
and elimination tracks than do the men

299
00:15:40.986 --> 00:15:43.366
who seem to operate much more quickly,

300
00:15:43.366 --> 00:15:48.366
but maybe have more heart issues.

301
00:15:48.707 --> 00:15:53.107
<v ->Just sort of an aside to that, physically what I notice,</v>

302
00:15:53.107 --> 00:15:55.406
and a lot of massage therapist body workers

303
00:15:55.406 --> 00:15:59.579
will say the same thing, men generally tend to have issues

304
00:15:59.579 --> 00:16:04.084
of low back, low back tension, whereas women

305
00:16:04.084 --> 00:16:08.577
tend to have issues of upper back and shoulder tension.

306
00:16:08.577 --> 00:16:12.292
The women are shouldering the burdens of family

307
00:16:12.292 --> 00:16:14.568
and taking care of their children and loved ones,

308
00:16:14.568 --> 00:16:19.568
whereas men carry the burdens of being that provider.

309
00:16:19.839 --> 00:16:22.869
It's just interesting to just kind of see that

310
00:16:22.869 --> 00:16:27.106
as a common tension pattern.

311
00:16:27.106 --> 00:16:31.832
<v Regina>Looking at it this way, how do you view</v>

312
00:16:31.832 --> 00:16:36.441
allopathic medicine then, where people go in with a symptom

313
00:16:36.441 --> 00:16:40.423
and the symptom is given some remedy.

314
00:16:40.423 --> 00:16:42.188
Anything to say about--

315
00:16:42.188 --> 00:16:43.848
Don't need to really say much about it, I guess.

316
00:16:43.848 --> 00:16:45.125
It's not very integrated.

317
00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:47.621
<v ->Well, some can be.</v>

318
00:16:47.621 --> 00:16:51.429
I certainly give credit to a lot of allopathic practitioners

319
00:16:51.429 --> 00:16:56.429
that are open to complimentary and alternative therapies.

320
00:17:00.622 --> 00:17:02.409
Generally speaking, I think allopathic

321
00:17:02.409 --> 00:17:06.182
tends to treat symptoms rather than cause.

322
00:17:06.182 --> 00:17:09.886
Often the sysmtoms can be easier to treat,

323
00:17:09.886 --> 00:17:13.450
however, it's not really getting at the root cause--

324
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.727
<v Regina>No, and it'll be back.</v>

325
00:17:14.727 --> 00:17:16.422
<v ->of maybe what's creating those symptoms.</v>

326
00:17:16.422 --> 00:17:18.431
Is that a system that perpetuates

327
00:17:18.431 --> 00:17:22.262
a dependency on a physician, or a medication,

328
00:17:22.262 --> 00:17:24.456
or some other kind of intervention,

329
00:17:24.456 --> 00:17:28.032
as opposed to a system like alternative or complimentary

330
00:17:28.032 --> 00:17:32.607
therapies that really try to address causes that will help

331
00:17:32.607 --> 00:17:36.844
empower the individual to not be dependent on, but to be

332
00:17:36.844 --> 00:17:41.140
able to prevent certain conditions from even arising.

333
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:45.215
I definitely see a bit of a dichotomy there.

334
00:17:45.215 --> 00:17:47.990
The Cayce readings, unfortunately I can't quote

335
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:51.526
the reading specifically, but there is a reading that says

336
00:17:51.526 --> 00:17:53.695
if the individual has the consciousness

337
00:17:53.695 --> 00:17:58.025
that a pill well help them, then let them take that pill.

338
00:17:58.025 --> 00:18:00.196
If they have the consciousness that a caster oil pack

339
00:18:00.196 --> 00:18:03.006
will help them, caster oil pack.

340
00:18:03.006 --> 00:18:06.907
We really wanna try to meet each person where they are,

341
00:18:06.907 --> 00:18:10.517
so to speak, and work within their belief system,

342
00:18:10.517 --> 00:18:13.350
because if you really, I have found,

343
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:18.350
that if you don't respect where a person is

344
00:18:18.749 --> 00:18:22.255
and at least go in from there with your work,

345
00:18:22.255 --> 00:18:25.355
then you're really missing an important step

346
00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:29.093
in their greater healing and their greater support.

347
00:18:29.093 --> 00:18:30.568
<v Regina>Absolutely, there's no point in trying to</v>

348
00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.530
take someone where they're not ready to go yet.

349
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.958
<v ->Exactly.</v>

350
00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:37.583
<v Regina>Going back to the Cayce readings then,</v>

351
00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:41.246
because this is a holistic almost multidimensional approach

352
00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:45.217
to healing, what was the hierarchy for him

353
00:18:45.217 --> 00:18:49.048
in terms of the spirit and your spiritual understanding

354
00:18:49.048 --> 00:18:51.382
and connection with life, versus the mind,

355
00:18:51.382 --> 00:18:54.017
versus the emotions, and then down into the body.

356
00:18:54.017 --> 00:18:57.059
What was the hierarchy there?

357
00:18:57.059 --> 00:18:58.858
<v ->Very clearly and simply stated,</v>

358
00:18:58.858 --> 00:19:01.656
spirit is life, mind is the builder,

359
00:19:01.656 --> 00:19:04.396
and physical is the result.

360
00:19:04.396 --> 00:19:08.100
You wanna have the integration of those three, of course.

361
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.805
What I love, love, love about the Cayce readings

362
00:19:10.805 --> 00:19:14.880
is that in the physical body, there's a direct connection

363
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.375
between the endocrine system, which is the glandular system

364
00:19:18.375 --> 00:19:23.375
of our body, and the emotional system,

365
00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.850
or our emotions.

366
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:31.529
For me, that's where I really resonate in, again, that ah ha

367
00:19:31.529 --> 00:19:32.829
and understanding.

368
00:19:32.829 --> 00:19:34.733
It makes a lot of sense to me that

369
00:19:34.733 --> 00:19:38.739
spirit brings in through the endocrine system

370
00:19:38.739 --> 00:19:42.976
through the chakras, those forces

371
00:19:42.976 --> 00:19:45.542
that then move through our body to influence

372
00:19:45.542 --> 00:19:47.606
our mind, our thoughts,

373
00:19:47.606 --> 00:19:51.042
that then therefore influence our physical health

374
00:19:51.042 --> 00:19:53.678
or lack thereof.

375
00:19:53.678 --> 00:19:55.222
<v Regina>He also, although it was out of</v>

376
00:19:55.222 --> 00:19:57.519
his comfort range initially,

377
00:19:57.519 --> 00:19:59.956
extends that back to past lives

378
00:19:59.956 --> 00:20:02.592
and what's brought forward from another life

379
00:20:02.592 --> 00:20:05.854
by way of a condition, a fear, or whatnot

380
00:20:05.854 --> 00:20:10.695
and that spiritual impact that starts influencing

381
00:20:10.695 --> 00:20:13.099
the mind and emotions in this lifetime, right?

382
00:20:13.099 --> 00:20:16.836
Can you speak a little bit about that?

383
00:20:16.836 --> 00:20:20.294
<v ->From what I know of past lives and soul development,</v>

384
00:20:20.294 --> 00:20:22.639
<v Regina>Soul development, yeah. I like that.</v>

385
00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:25.472
<v ->I resonate with that term more than past lives,</v>

386
00:20:25.472 --> 00:20:28.688
but that soul development is that the soul will incarnate

387
00:20:28.688 --> 00:20:33.483
as many times as it needs to perfect itself,

388
00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:35.352
to learn those lessons.

389
00:20:35.352 --> 00:20:38.963
Sometimes those physical symptoms can follow one

390
00:20:38.963 --> 00:20:40.994
through lifetimes.

391
00:20:40.994 --> 00:20:43.827
I've worked with someone recently who was having a lot

392
00:20:43.827 --> 00:20:47.171
of problems in her shoulder, in between her shoulder blades.

393
00:20:47.171 --> 00:20:49.737
She would say to me so often, I really think

394
00:20:49.737 --> 00:20:51.443
it's from past life.

395
00:20:51.443 --> 00:20:56.443
I really feel like I must have stabbed someone in the back

396
00:20:56.471 --> 00:21:01.152
in a past life and now I am experiencing

397
00:21:01.152 --> 00:21:03.648
this pain in my back.

398
00:21:03.648 --> 00:21:07.119
That came totally from her, that was not prompted by me,

399
00:21:07.119 --> 00:21:11.829
but we share this belief system and openness to exploring

400
00:21:11.829 --> 00:21:15.893
how past lives can influence whats going on for us now.

401
00:21:15.893 --> 00:21:19.457
Obviously for her, that was a very direct connection

402
00:21:19.457 --> 00:21:21.767
to physical symptoms that she was having.

403
00:21:21.767 --> 00:21:23.497
<v Regina>Once a person has determined this,</v>

404
00:21:23.497 --> 00:21:28.283
or they have a suspicion or an insight,

405
00:21:28.283 --> 00:21:31.181
what actually happens then to the body?

406
00:21:31.181 --> 00:21:35.568
<v ->Here she is carrying this pain.</v>

407
00:21:35.568 --> 00:21:40.568
A lot of our work then is physically working with that

408
00:21:40.826 --> 00:21:43.925
to ease her pain and to see what else could be contributing

409
00:21:43.925 --> 00:21:46.085
to that in this life.

410
00:21:46.085 --> 00:21:47.826
She's feeling that pain in her shoulders,

411
00:21:47.826 --> 00:21:52.134
but what is she holding onto in her arms

412
00:21:52.134 --> 00:21:53.666
and in her shoulders.

413
00:21:53.666 --> 00:21:55.872
Are there beliefs, are there attitudes

414
00:21:55.872 --> 00:21:59.645
that she could let go of and release

415
00:21:59.645 --> 00:22:02.606
to help release that pain.

416
00:22:02.606 --> 00:22:04.545
I have not yet, but I would love to train

417
00:22:04.545 --> 00:22:08.039
in hypnotherapy to be able to use that

418
00:22:08.039 --> 00:22:10.919
therapeutic direction to maybe help someone

419
00:22:10.919 --> 00:22:15.919
on an unconsciousness level release and forgive

420
00:22:16.352 --> 00:22:19.591
maybe past transgressions that are showing up

421
00:22:19.591 --> 00:22:21.333
in their physical body.

422
00:22:21.333 --> 00:22:24.363
<v Regina>It's a worthwhile endeavor, very.</v>

423
00:22:24.363 --> 00:22:26.604
That's interesting because I had something on my back,

424
00:22:26.604 --> 00:22:29.632
the back of one shoulder for years and

425
00:22:29.632 --> 00:22:32.069
under hypnosis I took a look at it

426
00:22:32.069 --> 00:22:34.437
and I saw something from another time

427
00:22:34.437 --> 00:22:36.875
that had to do with a spider bite that had taken place

428
00:22:36.875 --> 00:22:39.801
that was lethal in that area.

429
00:22:39.801 --> 00:22:41.554
I don't even know how long ago.

430
00:22:41.554 --> 00:22:44.886
This kind of pad of fat, lypoma, had developed

431
00:22:44.886 --> 00:22:47.347
over that area, kind of protecting something

432
00:22:47.347 --> 00:22:49.356
that wasn't there.

433
00:22:49.356 --> 00:22:53.695
I thought that was interesting at the time to see that.

434
00:22:53.695 --> 00:22:54.555
(laughing)

435
00:22:54.555 --> 00:22:58.798
You hear these kinds of things all the time.

436
00:22:58.798 --> 00:23:00.365
What about the dreaming part of it,

437
00:23:00.365 --> 00:23:03.094
because for you, that's another part.

438
00:23:03.094 --> 00:23:07.343
<v ->Absolutely, dreaming and meditation really have been,</v>

439
00:23:07.343 --> 00:23:09.003
dream interpretation and meditation,

440
00:23:09.003 --> 00:23:13.485
two really significant tools from the Cayce readings

441
00:23:13.485 --> 00:23:15.679
that I use on a daily basis.

442
00:23:15.679 --> 00:23:17.653
I just had a dream the other night in which

443
00:23:17.653 --> 00:23:20.253
something was missing from my suitcase.

444
00:23:20.253 --> 00:23:23.225
I thought, okay, let me go and see what symbolism

445
00:23:23.225 --> 00:23:24.990
does suitcase mean?

446
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:28.763
It was really fun to kind of reflect on what significance

447
00:23:28.763 --> 00:23:31.294
that could have for me at this time.

448
00:23:31.294 --> 00:23:33.837
<v Regina>When you say what significance suitcase has,</v>

449
00:23:33.837 --> 00:23:35.938
does that mean for you personally,

450
00:23:35.938 --> 00:23:39.828
or are you looking more as a larger symbol

451
00:23:39.828 --> 00:23:41.662
that's been established to have meaning?

452
00:23:41.662 --> 00:23:43.009
<v ->Both, both.</v>

453
00:23:43.009 --> 00:23:44.913
There are definitely archetypal symbols

454
00:23:44.913 --> 00:23:48.474
that have a universal meaning,

455
00:23:48.474 --> 00:23:52.177
and at the same time, what then does that mean for me?

456
00:23:52.177 --> 00:23:53.942
How does that apply right now?

457
00:23:53.942 --> 00:23:58.942
Suitcase has to do with journey, traveling,

458
00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.732
what you're carrying with you.

459
00:24:01.732 --> 00:24:05.280
For me, I reflected on, okay,

460
00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.303
am I leaving something?

461
00:24:07.303 --> 00:24:10.530
Am I forgetting something in my journey here?

462
00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:13.975
Am I worried about not having something in my journey

463
00:24:13.975 --> 00:24:17.788
that maybe I really don't need?

464
00:24:17.788 --> 00:24:20.880
It's both, really, a combination of the two.

465
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.144
We teach a class in our massage program,

466
00:24:23.144 --> 00:24:24.886
dreams and meditation.

467
00:24:24.886 --> 00:24:27.626
We teach that as a tool for massage therapists

468
00:24:27.626 --> 00:24:31.550
to be able to have a way to reflect on what's happening

469
00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:36.368
in their lives and supporting their own personal growth,

470
00:24:36.368 --> 00:24:39.929
again in service of the people that they will work with.

471
00:24:39.929 --> 00:24:41.868
It's really fascinating, especially when students

472
00:24:41.868 --> 00:24:44.592
come through our program.

473
00:24:44.592 --> 00:24:47.774
It can be very transformative for them on a personal level

474
00:24:47.774 --> 00:24:51.513
as they're learning to really sensitively work

475
00:24:51.513 --> 00:24:54.914
in such an intimate environment with another person,

476
00:24:54.914 --> 00:24:57.248
in the energy field of another.

477
00:24:57.248 --> 00:24:59.950
Whether or not your client believes that or not,

478
00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:02.621
we hold a belief, generally speaking,

479
00:25:02.621 --> 00:25:05.488
that we are touching their energy,

480
00:25:05.488 --> 00:25:10.236
touching their lives, not just their arm or their leg.

481
00:25:10.236 --> 00:25:13.365
That can bring up a lot of stuff for a person.

482
00:25:13.365 --> 00:25:15.234
<v Regina>Because of the type of training you do,</v>

483
00:25:15.234 --> 00:25:18.172
and your natural proclivities anyway,

484
00:25:18.172 --> 00:25:21.411
of being open to meditation, open to soul development

485
00:25:21.411 --> 00:25:25.683
and so forth, are a number of the people here

486
00:25:25.683 --> 00:25:28.679
or that come through this program

487
00:25:28.679 --> 00:25:31.419
open intuitively so they're able to really see

488
00:25:31.419 --> 00:25:34.461
what else is going on and maybe go inside

489
00:25:34.461 --> 00:25:37.584
within the mind of the other?

490
00:25:37.584 --> 00:25:40.962
<v ->A lot of the them are, and for a lot of them</v>

491
00:25:40.962 --> 00:25:44.631
this is new, this is s new exploration,

492
00:25:44.631 --> 00:25:47.696
a new territory.

493
00:25:47.696 --> 00:25:51.434
I have seen for some that can be a little intimidating,

494
00:25:51.434 --> 00:25:54.441
a little bit scary if they're still in their own

495
00:25:54.441 --> 00:25:57.681
sort of development and understanding of themselves.

496
00:25:57.681 --> 00:25:59.581
It can sometimes feel a little overwhelming

497
00:25:59.581 --> 00:26:04.121
when they're picking up sensations

498
00:26:04.121 --> 00:26:06.687
or emotions that they're not sure

499
00:26:06.687 --> 00:26:10.228
are these mine, are they coming from someone else?

500
00:26:10.228 --> 00:26:13.699
Just kind of in that whole nebulous, mysterious,

501
00:26:13.699 --> 00:26:17.797
lovely mysteriously territory of working with other people.

502
00:26:17.797 --> 00:26:21.338
It's definitely both, but I know that the fact that we can

503
00:26:21.338 --> 00:26:23.835
even have discussions like what we're having today,

504
00:26:23.835 --> 00:26:27.205
talk about these concepts, is something that

505
00:26:27.205 --> 00:26:28.671
is really attractive and appealing

506
00:26:28.671 --> 00:26:31.074
to the students that come here.

507
00:26:31.074 --> 00:26:33.211
They're looking for that.

508
00:26:33.211 --> 00:26:35.219
Something more than just --

509
00:26:35.219 --> 00:26:37.088
<v Regina>Massage school.</v>
<v ->The sciences.</v>

510
00:26:37.088 --> 00:26:38.725
Yeah, and the technique and the business.

511
00:26:38.725 --> 00:26:40.057
<v Regina>Is there anyone that is come along,</v>

512
00:26:40.057 --> 00:26:44.190
I'm not saying that is Edgar Cayce, but who is very open.

513
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.094
I mean, do you have some people here who are very open

514
00:26:46.094 --> 00:26:50.030
and really good readers of what's going on in that being?

515
00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:51.330
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

516
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.755
Students, teachers, and staff.

517
00:26:54.755 --> 00:26:59.039
There's a lot of people in our community that are very open.

518
00:26:59.039 --> 00:27:01.710
The ones that I have found that, for me, have resonated

519
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:06.710
and been the most skillful in sharing their

520
00:27:06.969 --> 00:27:11.969
intuitions and observations usually do so in a very gentle

521
00:27:12.449 --> 00:27:13.842
in a gentle way.

522
00:27:13.842 --> 00:27:17.755
They're very mindful not to, here's whats going on with you,

523
00:27:17.755 --> 00:27:21.261
to be aggressive in sharing what they're noticing,

524
00:27:21.261 --> 00:27:26.261
but they're very sensitive in how they

525
00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.932
approach another person with,

526
00:27:28.932 --> 00:27:30.905
"I'm kind of sensing something here.

527
00:27:30.905 --> 00:27:32.508
"Can I share with you?"

528
00:27:32.508 --> 00:27:34.342
Then when they share it's,

529
00:27:34.342 --> 00:27:35.909
"How does that sit with you?

530
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:38.115
"Does that make sense?"

531
00:27:38.115 --> 00:27:42.086
Again, it's kind of an exchange of here's what I'm seeing

532
00:27:42.086 --> 00:27:44.257
and is that true?

533
00:27:44.257 --> 00:27:49.156
Really being mindful to just not put our own stuff

534
00:27:49.156 --> 00:27:50.631
on someone else.

535
00:27:50.631 --> 00:27:52.454
<v Regina>Also, if you're seeing things often, there's</v>

536
00:27:52.454 --> 00:27:57.454
a big responsibility with that as to what should be shared.

537
00:27:57.543 --> 00:28:00.566
In the case of Cayce, when he was viewing people,

538
00:28:00.566 --> 00:28:02.702
he could see what was their dynamic was,

539
00:28:02.702 --> 00:28:05.360
but it was always followed up by the information

540
00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.576
that was going to balance that back out.

541
00:28:08.576 --> 00:28:12.149
Was he able to work with virtually any kind of condition

542
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:13.578
with people?

543
00:28:13.578 --> 00:28:14.947
<v ->As far as I know, yes.</v>

544
00:28:14.947 --> 00:28:17.653
I can't think of any--

545
00:28:17.653 --> 00:28:22.018
and again, there are scholars of these readings well beyond

546
00:28:22.018 --> 00:28:27.018
my years of experience, but I don't recall any that

547
00:28:27.463 --> 00:28:29.797
where there was a terrible blockage

548
00:28:29.797 --> 00:28:32.153
of that flow of information.

549
00:28:32.153 --> 00:28:34.568
If so, when he was in that trance state,

550
00:28:34.568 --> 00:28:38.342
he was able to say, I can't see that.

551
00:28:38.342 --> 00:28:39.944
<v Regina>Because it's being blocked from him.</v>

552
00:28:39.944 --> 00:28:43.972
Yes, but normally, from what I understand,

553
00:28:43.972 --> 00:28:48.512
if people were given remedies

554
00:28:48.512 --> 00:28:50.346
and they actually followed the protocols,

555
00:28:50.346 --> 00:28:53.760
which is the big X factor, a lot of people won't do it.

556
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.753
If they followed it, they were generally cured.

557
00:28:57.753 --> 00:28:59.495
<v ->Generally speaking, yeah, or certainly</v>

558
00:28:59.495 --> 00:29:03.001
their conditions were improved greatly.

559
00:29:03.001 --> 00:29:05.370
A lot of the readings, the health readings in particular,

560
00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:08.098
there are follow-ups and someone might say

561
00:29:08.098 --> 00:29:10.199
okay, well we did this, this, and this,

562
00:29:10.199 --> 00:29:13.009
and there's still this going on.

563
00:29:13.009 --> 00:29:15.215
So, they would go back to Cayce and he would say,

564
00:29:15.215 --> 00:29:16.213
"Uh huh."

565
00:29:16.213 --> 00:29:19.685
Sometimes it was a subtle shift in they need an adjustment

566
00:29:19.685 --> 00:29:24.685
in the thoracic vertebrae number 10 instead of number 12,

567
00:29:24.979 --> 00:29:28.090
or the castor oil pack needs to happen

568
00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:31.155
at 9 pm instead of 9 am.

569
00:29:31.155 --> 00:29:33.059
There were subtle adjustments that

570
00:29:33.059 --> 00:29:35.452
when he was in that trance state,

571
00:29:35.452 --> 00:29:38.171
he could see and recommend.

572
00:29:38.171 --> 00:29:42.629
that's just so unbelievably fascinating to me.

573
00:29:42.629 --> 00:29:44.208
I know a big part of
<v Regina>He was so specific.</v>

574
00:29:44.208 --> 00:29:45.474
<v ->why I'm still here, yeah.</v>

575
00:29:45.474 --> 00:29:47.610
That his information could be so specific,

576
00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:49.909
especially when it came to physical symptoms

577
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:52.819
and the physical treatments of those ailments.

578
00:29:52.819 --> 00:29:54.004
<v Regina>There are a couple books</v>

579
00:29:54.004 --> 00:29:57.219
in the library downstairs that have documented that,

580
00:29:57.219 --> 00:29:59.750
but also, you must

581
00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:04.750
the healing facility here must still employ some of his--

582
00:30:05.532 --> 00:30:07.924
Can you talk about some?
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>

583
00:30:07.924 --> 00:30:09.096
<v Regina>I mean like you talk about</v>

584
00:30:09.096 --> 00:30:12.923
the castor oil packs, for example.

585
00:30:12.923 --> 00:30:15.188
Anyone who's read Cayce knows about those.

586
00:30:15.188 --> 00:30:17.336
Talk about that for a moment.

587
00:30:17.336 --> 00:30:18.869
Does that still have value?

588
00:30:18.869 --> 00:30:20.808
Do these remedies still have value

589
00:30:20.808 --> 00:30:23.582
even though, granted, all kinds of super foods

590
00:30:23.582 --> 00:30:26.450
and super vibrational devices and everything

591
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:27.611
have entered the market,

592
00:30:27.611 --> 00:30:32.220
let's talk about what still has lasting value.

593
00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.285
<v ->There was a particular routine for the administration</v>

594
00:30:35.285 --> 00:30:37.189
of a massage that was taught,

595
00:30:37.189 --> 00:30:39.221
and that's the routine that we teach here,

596
00:30:39.221 --> 00:30:40.359
which is very unique.

597
00:30:40.359 --> 00:30:42.460
Only at our school can one learn that.

598
00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.596
The techniques themselves are Swedish based,

599
00:30:44.596 --> 00:30:47.174
traditional, just like you'd probably get in any other

600
00:30:47.174 --> 00:30:50.367
massage that you might get from other practitioners,

601
00:30:50.367 --> 00:30:54.070
but it was that routine that was so unique.

602
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:55.672
Within that routine, there are

603
00:30:55.672 --> 00:30:59.427
particular patterns of spinal massage

604
00:30:59.427 --> 00:31:02.380
to coordinate and balance the nervous system,

605
00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.388
is why we do those different patterns

606
00:31:04.388 --> 00:31:05.677
of massage.
<v Regina>Is that like the</v>

607
00:31:05.677 --> 00:31:07.488
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system,

608
00:31:07.488 --> 00:31:09.288
to get them back in harmony?

609
00:31:09.288 --> 00:31:10.995
<v ->Exactly, to balance the --</v>

610
00:31:10.995 --> 00:31:13.990
For example, going from the neck to the low back,

611
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:18.622
circular spinal massage to balance the bundles

612
00:31:18.622 --> 00:31:21.571
of nerve ganglia that lie along the spine,

613
00:31:21.571 --> 00:31:24.369
which then have their effect as those nerves branch out

614
00:31:24.369 --> 00:31:27.794
into the body to help coordinate all of our systems

615
00:31:27.794 --> 00:31:31.544
to function more efficiently and properly.

616
00:31:31.544 --> 00:31:33.785
The massage routine with those spinal patterns,

617
00:31:33.785 --> 00:31:36.478
but we do still teach the remedies and

618
00:31:36.478 --> 00:31:39.288
they're pretty,

619
00:31:39.288 --> 00:31:41.088
well some people say they're old fashioned.

620
00:31:41.088 --> 00:31:42.690
They're home remedies,

621
00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:44.756
but I think it really speaks to the fact that

622
00:31:44.756 --> 00:31:48.158
as advanced as one might get, sometimes it's still

623
00:31:48.158 --> 00:31:50.201
those very simple

624
00:31:50.201 --> 00:31:51.362
basic foundations--
<v Regina>That's what</v>

625
00:31:51.362 --> 00:31:53.104
I wanna know.
<v ->That are really effective.</v>

626
00:31:53.104 --> 00:31:54.729
<v Regina>What are a couple that still really work?</v>

627
00:31:54.729 --> 00:31:56.424
<v ->The castor oil packs, absolutely,</v>

628
00:31:56.424 --> 00:31:58.236
<v Regina>Talk about that.</v>
<v ->I am a castor oil proponent,</v>

629
00:31:58.236 --> 00:31:59.814
Will be forever.

630
00:31:59.814 --> 00:32:01.440
<v Regina>Let's talk about it and how it's used</v>

631
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.612
and what it does.

632
00:32:02.612 --> 00:32:04.714
<v ->Castor oil has a lot of different uses.</v>

633
00:32:04.714 --> 00:32:08.882
The oil itself, and as you know, it's paradoxical

634
00:32:08.882 --> 00:32:11.018
because the bean is poisonous,

635
00:32:11.018 --> 00:32:13.085
but the oil is what is so healing.

636
00:32:13.085 --> 00:32:17.287
The Palm of Christ, Palma Christi oil is what it's known as.

637
00:32:17.287 --> 00:32:21.096
You can use it topically, superficially on skin wounds,

638
00:32:21.096 --> 00:32:26.096
rashes, cuts, acne it's very beneficial for,

639
00:32:26.262 --> 00:32:30.035
but it's most known as a castor oil pack.

640
00:32:30.035 --> 00:32:33.135
You soak a piece of wool flannel

641
00:32:33.135 --> 00:32:34.540
with the castor oil.

642
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.312
You apply it to the liver, generally speaking,

643
00:32:37.312 --> 00:32:42.312
so that that oil then soaks into the liver to purify.

644
00:32:42.544 --> 00:32:45.720
The liver is the organ that really holds all of our toxins,

645
00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.926
flushes them, filters them,

646
00:32:47.926 --> 00:32:51.290
and so that healing oil then soaks into the liver

647
00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:55.794
that then can cleanse those toxins.

648
00:32:55.794 --> 00:32:58.662
It's very effective for constipation,

649
00:32:58.662 --> 00:33:01.297
all kinds of digestive issues,

650
00:33:01.297 --> 00:33:04.061
conditions such as psoriasis and eczema,

651
00:33:04.061 --> 00:33:09.061
which are known to come from the intestinal system

652
00:33:09.541 --> 00:33:12.141
and manifest externally on the body

653
00:33:12.141 --> 00:33:16.286
because of maybe different buildups in the intestines

654
00:33:16.286 --> 00:33:19.188
or again, some toxins that aren't being filtered

655
00:33:19.188 --> 00:33:23.960
through the liver, so the packs are incredibly healing.

656
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:28.960
I've seen people with skin conditions for years

657
00:33:29.463 --> 00:33:33.840
have those conditions miraculously healed, if you will.

658
00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:34.932
<v Regina>Really? Even acne?</v>

659
00:33:34.932 --> 00:33:35.930
<v ->Even Acne.</v>

660
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:39.065
<v Regina>Is that true for pubescent acne or mostly for</v>

661
00:33:39.065 --> 00:33:42.942
acne having to do more with toxicity in later in our years?

662
00:33:42.942 --> 00:33:46.681
<v ->Mostly toxicity and just the chemical</v>

663
00:33:46.681 --> 00:33:49.456
and foods that we eat that might activate

664
00:33:49.456 --> 00:33:52.358
different blockages in our pores.

665
00:33:52.358 --> 00:33:55.609
I don't know of anyone specifically with adolescent acne,

666
00:33:55.609 --> 00:33:58.825
but if I had to go back and do it over again,

667
00:33:58.825 --> 00:34:00.659
I would certainly use it, I would.

668
00:34:00.659 --> 00:34:03.001
It kind of goes contra to what you'd think,

669
00:34:03.001 --> 00:34:04.127
because people think,

670
00:34:04.127 --> 00:34:07.030
"Ugh, I don't wanna put that thick oil on my face."

671
00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:11.500
But, it's not a thickness that blocks,

672
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.681
it's a thickness that absorbs and penetrates

673
00:34:14.681 --> 00:34:17.282
to cleanse and heal.

674
00:34:17.282 --> 00:34:20.184
Castor oil is known to have antiseptic benefits,

675
00:34:20.184 --> 00:34:23.412
and so that is that healing property

676
00:34:23.412 --> 00:34:25.223
that's within it as well.

677
00:34:25.223 --> 00:34:26.651
<v Regina>So, eczema and psoriasis?</v>

678
00:34:26.651 --> 00:34:27.789
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

679
00:34:27.789 --> 00:34:29.089
<v Regina>That's through the liver?</v>

680
00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:31.388
<v ->That's right, that's through the packs.</v>

681
00:34:31.388 --> 00:34:34.197
I have worked with a lot of friends and clients

682
00:34:34.197 --> 00:34:38.168
doing the castor oil packs, a lot for constipation

683
00:34:38.168 --> 00:34:40.072
and digestive issues

684
00:34:40.072 --> 00:34:43.601
and sometimes people see results even after one pack.

685
00:34:43.601 --> 00:34:45.111
Generally, they're done in a series,

686
00:34:45.111 --> 00:34:47.340
so you do three days on, four days off,

687
00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.581
for a series of three weeks.

688
00:34:49.581 --> 00:34:50.683
<v Regina>Does that mean for an hour</v>

689
00:34:50.683 --> 00:34:52.112
or to sleep with it or what?

690
00:34:52.112 --> 00:34:54.410
<v ->You can leave it on for longer than an hour,</v>

691
00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:56.709
but generally it's about an hour to two.

692
00:34:56.709 --> 00:34:57.789
<v Regina>Is it heated?</v>

693
00:34:57.789 --> 00:35:01.492
<v ->Yup, you put a hot pad, a heating pad over top</v>

694
00:35:01.492 --> 00:35:03.420
to help it soak in, but for women,

695
00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.893
for example, if you're having your mentrual flow,

696
00:35:05.893 --> 00:35:07.889
then you can do the pack without the heat.

697
00:35:07.889 --> 00:35:10.699
It can be done either way.

698
00:35:10.699 --> 00:35:12.603
One thing that I love about the packs

699
00:35:12.603 --> 00:35:14.333
and the Cacye readings is that,

700
00:35:14.333 --> 00:35:15.935
the person who's giving the pack

701
00:35:15.935 --> 00:35:17.572
as well as the person receiving,

702
00:35:17.572 --> 00:35:22.485
really needs to be in a meditative state.

703
00:35:22.485 --> 00:35:25.348
Using again, back to the thoughts, using our thoughts

704
00:35:25.348 --> 00:35:28.053
to affirm health, to affirm the healing

705
00:35:28.053 --> 00:35:30.723
that's happening from this pack.

706
00:35:30.723 --> 00:35:35.518
The Cayce readings would caution against turning on your TV

707
00:35:35.518 --> 00:35:38.990
while the pack is on and watching the Nightly News,

708
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:41.126
because that's gonna stress your system.

709
00:35:41.126 --> 00:35:43.332
You'd wanna listen to relaxing music,

710
00:35:43.332 --> 00:35:47.755
lie in a comfortable bed, or just be silent for that time.

711
00:35:47.755 --> 00:35:50.843
It's not just the therapy, but those attitudes

712
00:35:50.843 --> 00:35:55.843
that you put with it both as the receiver and as the giver.

713
00:35:56.312 --> 00:36:00.677
I can recall many times getting teary-eyed

714
00:36:00.677 --> 00:36:03.556
and tearing up when I'd be giving a castor oil pack

715
00:36:03.556 --> 00:36:06.656
because I was sort of overcome with that emotion

716
00:36:06.656 --> 00:36:10.383
of giving and caring to another person.

717
00:36:10.383 --> 00:36:13.529
<v Regina>Maybe also their gratitude and appreciation</v>

718
00:36:13.529 --> 00:36:16.559
that it was making a nice little circle of love there.

719
00:36:16.559 --> 00:36:18.663
<v ->That's right.</v>

720
00:36:18.663 --> 00:36:20.701
<v Regina>You were talking about the lower back earlier,</v>

721
00:36:20.701 --> 00:36:23.093
is the castor oil pack something you'd use

722
00:36:23.093 --> 00:36:24.544
on the lower back as well?

723
00:36:24.544 --> 00:36:27.110
<v ->You could, you could use it on the knee.</v>

724
00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:30.012
You can use it on really any body part.

725
00:36:30.012 --> 00:36:32.149
<v Regina>How would that interface with the lower back</v>

726
00:36:32.149 --> 00:36:36.584
if you have security issues in life.

727
00:36:36.584 --> 00:36:40.682
<v ->Hopefully, ideally, it would help resolve,</v>

728
00:36:40.682 --> 00:36:43.120
it would help heal those issues.

729
00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:46.324
It would bring a balance back to the body.

730
00:36:46.324 --> 00:36:50.330
Sometimes it might not even be at one's

731
00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:53.986
conscious level of awareness, but

732
00:36:53.986 --> 00:36:56.723
because of relief they might feel physically,

733
00:36:56.723 --> 00:36:58.976
then all of a sudden they have a shift

734
00:36:58.976 --> 00:37:03.144
in how they are experiencing the world,

735
00:37:03.144 --> 00:37:04.943
how they behave in the world.

736
00:37:04.943 --> 00:37:08.716
They're more at easy and not really knowing

737
00:37:08.716 --> 00:37:11.213
why they feel that shift.

738
00:37:11.213 --> 00:37:12.617
<v Regina>So, that could assist in that?</v>

739
00:37:12.617 --> 00:37:13.558
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

740
00:37:13.558 --> 00:37:14.916
<v Regina>Bringing that balance back</v>

741
00:37:14.916 --> 00:37:17.621
through castor oil pack on the lower back.

742
00:37:17.621 --> 00:37:19.792
Aside from the castor oil packs,

743
00:37:19.792 --> 00:37:21.696
what are some of the other really well known

744
00:37:21.696 --> 00:37:24.367
Cayce remedies?

745
00:37:24.367 --> 00:37:27.432
<v ->Glyco thymoline is a product that, again,</v>

746
00:37:27.432 --> 00:37:30.938
is an antiseptic, antibacterial product that's used

747
00:37:30.938 --> 00:37:34.607
quite a bit for all kinds of intestinal,

748
00:37:34.607 --> 00:37:38.914
digestive conditions, as well as mouth and oral conditions.

749
00:37:38.914 --> 00:37:42.281
So, to cleanse the mouth, to be a good mouth wash.

750
00:37:42.281 --> 00:37:46.310
It's also an alkalinizing product.

751
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:49.456
The Cayce readings talk a lot about health and illness

752
00:37:49.456 --> 00:37:52.358
from the standpoint of this acid alkaline balance

753
00:37:52.358 --> 00:37:54.529
in our bodies.

754
00:37:54.529 --> 00:37:56.584
Glyco thymoline helps to restore

755
00:37:56.584 --> 00:37:59.069
a more alkaline state in the body.

756
00:37:59.069 --> 00:38:00.067
<v Regina>Is it something you take?</v>

757
00:38:00.067 --> 00:38:01.937
<v ->Mmhmm, it's like a red mouth wash.</v>

758
00:38:01.937 --> 00:38:03.202
<v Regina>Like a red mouth wash?</v>

759
00:38:03.202 --> 00:38:04.607
<v ->You can gargle with it.</v>

760
00:38:04.607 --> 00:38:06.941
Sometimes when I might feel a cold coming on,

761
00:38:06.941 --> 00:38:09.390
I will drink it.

762
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:12.916
Not too much because it tastes a little medicinal,

763
00:38:12.916 --> 00:38:15.505
a little funky, but you can mix it with water

764
00:38:15.505 --> 00:38:17.456
to water it down a little bit.

765
00:38:17.456 --> 00:38:20.916
I will drink that just to help balance out

766
00:38:20.916 --> 00:38:23.516
like i said, when I feel a cold coming on.

767
00:38:23.516 --> 00:38:26.953
You can use glyco thymoline in a pack across the sinuses

768
00:38:26.953 --> 00:38:30.796
that helps to relieve sinus pressure and congestion.

769
00:38:30.796 --> 00:38:32.003
Those are probably the two--

770
00:38:32.003 --> 00:38:33.129
<v Regina>I've never heard of glyco thymoline.</v>

771
00:38:33.129 --> 00:38:34.372
<v ->Oh, you'll find it in our book store.</v>

772
00:38:34.372 --> 00:38:35.196
<v Regina>It's down in the book store,</v>

773
00:38:35.196 --> 00:38:37.367
we'll have to take some home and have that on hand.

774
00:38:37.367 --> 00:38:39.108
<v ->Youll find it in a red box probably,</v>

775
00:38:39.108 --> 00:38:43.509
and again, a red mouth wash type product.

776
00:38:43.509 --> 00:38:47.352
<v Regina>Glyco thymoline.</v>

777
00:38:47.352 --> 00:38:51.253
<v ->Baking soda was a pretty common remedy and Cacye readings</v>

778
00:38:51.253 --> 00:38:55.560
would often mix it with castor oil for warts and moles,

779
00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.393
bee stings, bug bites, that kind of thing

780
00:38:58.393 --> 00:39:01.330
you could use it for.

781
00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:03.931
He also recommended some of the readings

782
00:39:03.931 --> 00:39:07.936
that we teach our different types of packs and poultices.

783
00:39:07.936 --> 00:39:11.895
There is a mustard pack for congestion in the chest,

784
00:39:11.895 --> 00:39:15.343
there was apple cider vinegar, that's another huge product

785
00:39:15.343 --> 00:39:17.143
recommended in a lot of the readings.

786
00:39:17.143 --> 00:39:17.979
<v Regina>For alkalinity again?</v>

787
00:39:17.979 --> 00:39:20.312
<v ->For alkalinity and for that detox</v>

788
00:39:20.312 --> 00:39:22.855
and antiseptic properties.

789
00:39:22.855 --> 00:39:26.849
Apple cider vinegar can be used for relief of sunburn,

790
00:39:26.849 --> 00:39:31.551
it can be mixed with Epsom salts to help reduce inflamation

791
00:39:31.551 --> 00:39:34.360
of injuries, sprains, and strains.

792
00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.263
You can do a pack of apple cider vinegar and Epsom salts

793
00:39:37.263 --> 00:39:39.596
and that can have some pretty unbelieveable--

794
00:39:39.596 --> 00:39:42.069
<v Regina>Some people drink it in the morning.</v>

795
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:43.474
<v ->Some people do.
<v Regina>Like a tablespoon</v>

796
00:39:43.474 --> 00:39:46.644
in warm water, and I don't know if he was a proponent

797
00:39:46.644 --> 00:39:49.880
of that to alkalize the system in the morning.

798
00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.908
<v ->Even lemon and water was recommend as an</v>

799
00:39:53.908 --> 00:39:57.786
early morning drink when you wake up to help, again,

800
00:39:57.786 --> 00:40:01.780
cleanse the drosses in the system

801
00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.230
and bring some alkalinity there.

802
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:06.726
Orange juice mixed with lemon juice

803
00:40:06.726 --> 00:40:10.128
is also another good alkalizing product.

804
00:40:10.128 --> 00:40:12.124
Sometimes people think, well orange juice and citrus

805
00:40:12.124 --> 00:40:16.734
is acid, acidity, but when you drink it

806
00:40:16.734 --> 00:40:20.542
and it's inside your body, it has that alkalizing effect.

807
00:40:20.542 --> 00:40:25.542
It kind of has its opposite effect inside the body

808
00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:30.121
than what you might think externally.

809
00:40:30.121 --> 00:40:32.218
<v Regina>Let's see, so we have the castor oil,</v>

810
00:40:32.218 --> 00:40:34.784
and we have the glyco thymoline,

811
00:40:34.784 --> 00:40:37.524
and we have the apple cider vinegar,

812
00:40:37.524 --> 00:40:39.590
and then the citruses in the morning.

813
00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:40.763
<v ->Yup, baking soda.</v>

814
00:40:40.763 --> 00:40:42.493
<v Regina>Baking soda, which I mean even,</v>

815
00:40:42.493 --> 00:40:45.302
I think it's Dr. Simoncini, in Italy,

816
00:40:45.302 --> 00:40:47.253
of course he got in big trouble for it,

817
00:40:47.253 --> 00:40:51.336
was injecting a type of essentially baking soda

818
00:40:51.336 --> 00:40:56.072
into breast tumors and boom gone.

819
00:40:56.072 --> 00:40:58.683
Of course, I think he's had some problems

820
00:40:58.683 --> 00:41:01.585
with the medical industry even though he's a medical doctor

821
00:41:01.585 --> 00:41:04.720
for doing this because it's doing an end run around

822
00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:08.493
the other common cancer therapies, chemo.

823
00:41:08.493 --> 00:41:13.493
<v ->I appreciate the skepticism that sometimes comes</v>

824
00:41:13.555 --> 00:41:17.189
when some of these alternative home remedies are offered,

825
00:41:17.189 --> 00:41:20.173
but I usually say to a person, just try it.

826
00:41:20.173 --> 00:41:22.100
It's not gonna hurt anything.

827
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.969
Usually when you assure someone it's not

828
00:41:23.969 --> 00:41:26.210
gonna make your condition any worse,

829
00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:29.078
just give it a try, come see me, I'll help you,

830
00:41:29.078 --> 00:41:32.410
I'll apply it for you, sometimes the unknown of how to do it

831
00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:36.845
really can turn people off from trying something different.

832
00:41:36.845 --> 00:41:41.845
Once they try, most people have been converts.

833
00:41:41.918 --> 00:41:45.158
I can think of my sister and her fiancé

834
00:41:45.158 --> 00:41:49.360
had a stye in his eye, and I told her about the potato

835
00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.870
poultice that was recommended

836
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:53.726
for styes in the Cayce readings.

837
00:41:53.726 --> 00:41:56.466
She thought I was off my rocker.

838
00:41:56.466 --> 00:41:58.939
You want me to shred an old Irish potato

839
00:41:58.939 --> 00:42:01.028
and put this on his eye?

840
00:42:01.028 --> 00:42:05.011
She did it, and sure enough, within a couple of days,

841
00:42:05.011 --> 00:42:06.717
the stye was gone.

842
00:42:06.717 --> 00:42:08.552
<v Regina>Yes, and we have to remember,</v>

843
00:42:08.552 --> 00:42:11.953
Cayce was not making this stuff up.

844
00:42:11.953 --> 00:42:15.889
He was an open clear channel for cosmic information.

845
00:42:15.889 --> 00:42:20.193
He was allowing what was true for our species at the time

846
00:42:20.193 --> 00:42:23.165
and now to be seen.

847
00:42:23.165 --> 00:42:25.696
<v ->These things, these home remedies, these products,</v>

848
00:42:25.696 --> 00:42:30.696
they have properties that

849
00:42:34.425 --> 00:42:37.246
effect different conditions.

850
00:42:37.246 --> 00:42:42.146
Not to take it from surface assumptions you have

851
00:42:42.146 --> 00:42:43.945
about what baking soda is.

852
00:42:43.945 --> 00:42:44.921
<v Regina>Or a potato.</v>

853
00:42:44.921 --> 00:42:47.556
<v ->Or a potato, or a mouthwash.</v>

854
00:42:47.556 --> 00:42:48.787
<v Regina>More than just a french fry.</v>

855
00:42:48.787 --> 00:42:53.787
<v ->What is in that that has its effect on different</v>

856
00:42:53.992 --> 00:42:57.770
aspects of your system's functioning.

857
00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:01.973
<v Regina>Yes, and I think it's important that we remember</v>

858
00:43:01.973 --> 00:43:05.409
that this information was coming from other places.

859
00:43:05.409 --> 00:43:06.768
What about sunshine?

860
00:43:06.768 --> 00:43:08.439
What about some of the natural elements?

861
00:43:08.439 --> 00:43:10.169
How was he on the sun?

862
00:43:10.169 --> 00:43:14.546
<v ->Definitely walking, just taking a light moderate walk</v>

863
00:43:14.546 --> 00:43:16.613
to get the fresh air and the sunshine

864
00:43:16.613 --> 00:43:21.181
is recommended specifically in many Cayce readings.

865
00:43:21.181 --> 00:43:24.156
There's a quote, I can't recall it specifically right now,

866
00:43:24.156 --> 00:43:26.966
but after breakfast, work a while,

867
00:43:26.966 --> 00:43:31.865
after lunch, rest a while, after dinner, walk a mile.

868
00:43:31.865 --> 00:43:35.337
It's all about that balance between your work, your rest,

869
00:43:35.337 --> 00:43:39.574
your play, your acid alkaline foods that you're eating,

870
00:43:39.574 --> 00:43:43.800
and certainly sunshine and the vitamins that we absorb

871
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:47.766
through our skin and body just by getting that natural light

872
00:43:47.766 --> 00:43:51.587
can have a very significant impact on someone's health.

873
00:43:51.587 --> 00:43:53.422
<v ->{Regina] Were there any-- Although I know</v>

874
00:43:53.422 --> 00:43:58.422
we're each very unique in terms of our own body chemistry,

875
00:43:59.459 --> 00:44:02.466
our alkaline acid balances, and so forth.

876
00:44:02.466 --> 00:44:06.471
Were there any over arching dietary guidelines

877
00:44:06.471 --> 00:44:08.607
that he passed on?

878
00:44:08.607 --> 00:44:11.034
<v ->The biggest one is that acid alkaline balance.</v>

879
00:44:11.034 --> 00:44:15.742
80% alkaline to 20% acid.

880
00:44:15.742 --> 00:44:19.441
He would suggest to avoid foods or beverages

881
00:44:19.441 --> 00:44:22.344
that produce an acidic condition in the body

882
00:44:22.344 --> 00:44:26.082
such as carbonated beverages, alcoholic beverages,

883
00:44:26.082 --> 00:44:30.192
sweets, sugars, those types of things that, again,

884
00:44:30.192 --> 00:44:32.921
create that acid condition.

885
00:44:32.921 --> 00:44:37.658
He recommended a lot of vegetables, of course,

886
00:44:37.658 --> 00:44:41.036
naturally to produce that alkaline state.

887
00:44:41.036 --> 00:44:45.576
Very minimal carbohydrates, but not just those guidelines,

888
00:44:45.576 --> 00:44:48.548
but how you combine the foods.

889
00:44:48.548 --> 00:44:52.414
He would suggest that you combine proteins and vegetables,

890
00:44:52.414 --> 00:44:57.313
or starches and vegetables, but not to combine

891
00:44:57.313 --> 00:45:01.818
proteins and starches because that combonation

892
00:45:01.818 --> 00:45:05.928
produces a challenge in your digestive system.

893
00:45:05.928 --> 00:45:10.700
Those need different enzymes to be digested.

894
00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:15.053
Combining them in one meal, you're sort of cancelling out

895
00:45:15.053 --> 00:45:18.304
those enzymes and preventing them from digesting properly.

896
00:45:18.304 --> 00:45:21.508
Whereas, if you have a vegetable and a starch, those enzymes

897
00:45:21.508 --> 00:45:23.238
aren't competing against each other,

898
00:45:23.238 --> 00:45:26.884
so you can digest that more easily.

899
00:45:26.884 --> 00:45:28.985
He also suggested certain things like

900
00:45:28.985 --> 00:45:33.985
not mixing citrus fruits with starches or other,

901
00:45:34.941 --> 00:45:38.053
have those separately.

902
00:45:38.053 --> 00:45:42.093
Those are some of the big ones, and water, of course.

903
00:45:42.093 --> 00:45:45.758
<v Regina>What about as the body ages and we supposedly</v>

904
00:45:45.758 --> 00:45:49.938
have less enzymes active in the digestive process?

905
00:45:49.938 --> 00:45:52.504
Would you say from looking at this,

906
00:45:52.504 --> 00:45:55.278
that if you're keeping your acid alkaline balance

907
00:45:55.278 --> 00:45:58.204
right to begin with, you're not experiencing that same

908
00:45:58.204 --> 00:45:59.737
kind of depletion?

909
00:45:59.737 --> 00:46:01.943
<v ->That would be my assumption, absolutely.</v>

910
00:46:01.943 --> 00:46:04.943
I can't recall that the Cayce readings or any reference

911
00:46:04.943 --> 00:46:09.943
that I'm familiar with speaks specifically to--

912
00:46:10.184 --> 00:46:11.662
<v Regina>A reduction in those enzymes?</v>

913
00:46:11.662 --> 00:46:15.424
<v ->Yes, speaks specifically to that, but more how to correct</v>

914
00:46:15.424 --> 00:46:17.491
an imbalance that could be there

915
00:46:17.491 --> 00:46:21.122
because of longstanding dietary patterns.

916
00:46:21.122 --> 00:46:22.236
<v Regina>Anything else you can think of</v>

917
00:46:22.236 --> 00:46:25.800
that are really the backbones of Cayce readings,

918
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.246
that can apply to any of us, we can hear from this right now

919
00:46:29.246 --> 00:46:31.707
and say, oh yeah, I need to consider that.

920
00:46:31.707 --> 00:46:36.707
<v ->The attitudes and emotions, certainly, the diet,</v>

921
00:46:37.117 --> 00:46:39.149
the health, balance.

922
00:46:39.149 --> 00:46:40.217
<v Regina>Meditation.</v>

923
00:46:40.217 --> 00:46:45.217
<v ->Meditation, and finding your ideal and living in alignment</v>

924
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:50.720
with your higher spiritual ideal is certainly

925
00:46:51.293 --> 00:46:54.068
what I believe is one of the other biggest tenets

926
00:46:54.068 --> 00:46:59.068
of the Cayce readings, is what is our purpose?

927
00:46:59.234 --> 00:47:01.138
What is our lifes purpose?

928
00:47:01.138 --> 00:47:04.377
There are different guided meditations and processies

929
00:47:04.377 --> 00:47:07.210
a person can go through to align with what they think

930
00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:08.952
their ideal is at any given time.

931
00:47:08.952 --> 00:47:11.378
It can change over the course of a life time,

932
00:47:11.378 --> 00:47:14.583
but they're generally larger themes like love,

933
00:47:14.583 --> 00:47:19.583
cooperation, service, and so to really

934
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:23.125
stay in that mindful meditative state where you are

935
00:47:23.125 --> 00:47:27.165
aware and connected with what your larger soul's purpose is

936
00:47:27.165 --> 00:47:29.940
and really live from that

937
00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:33.504
and that when you live from thy ideal, as Cayce would say,

938
00:47:33.504 --> 00:47:38.206
then you will be doing the best that you can

939
00:47:38.206 --> 00:47:40.946
in your own life and for the lives of others.

940
00:47:40.946 --> 00:47:43.082
That when we're aligned with that spiritual ideal,

941
00:47:43.082 --> 00:47:45.056
then we're aligned with our maker.

942
00:47:45.056 --> 00:47:48.423
The Cayce readings refer to God and our maker

943
00:47:48.423 --> 00:47:50.896
and really being aligned with that higher source,

944
00:47:50.896 --> 00:47:53.589
which comes through us through our ideal

945
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:58.589
and our attunement to that.

946
00:47:58.844 --> 00:48:00.732
<v Regina>As you have mentioned, and I just popped in</v>

947
00:48:00.732 --> 00:48:04.099
a second ago, he really believed that

948
00:48:04.099 --> 00:48:07.338
one had to take meditative time.

949
00:48:07.338 --> 00:48:09.210
If you're going to know thyself,

950
00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:11.544
know your ideal, to know anything.

951
00:48:11.544 --> 00:48:13.575
To know what's going on in your body,

952
00:48:13.575 --> 00:48:15.050
and to balance it.

953
00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:18.010
<v ->That's right, I love this quote from the Cayce readings,</v>

954
00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:20.321
"Prayer is talking to God

955
00:48:20.321 --> 00:48:24.059
"and meditation is listening to God."

956
00:48:24.059 --> 00:48:27.055
We pray to be a channel of blessings,

957
00:48:27.055 --> 00:48:31.803
to be guided and centered, that thy will be done

958
00:48:31.803 --> 00:48:33.263
in me and through me.

959
00:48:33.263 --> 00:48:36.398
Then we have our meditation time to really listen

960
00:48:36.398 --> 00:48:39.335
and be still and hear that guidance

961
00:48:39.335 --> 00:48:42.539
so that we know how to go forward in our lives.

962
00:48:42.539 --> 00:48:44.049
<v Regina>I'm looking forward to experiencing</v>

963
00:48:44.049 --> 00:48:47.311
the meditation room here a little bit later.

964
00:48:47.311 --> 00:48:48.611
<v ->It's lovely.</v>

965
00:48:48.611 --> 00:48:52.280
I often lead the staff meditation.

966
00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.254
We all take turns on different weeks.

967
00:48:54.254 --> 00:48:58.190
Those weeks for me are some of the most precious

968
00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:00.697
and I look forward to that every time I go.

969
00:49:00.697 --> 00:49:02.416
It's a very beautiful space

970
00:49:02.416 --> 00:49:05.597
and you can just feel the reverence that's there.

971
00:49:05.597 --> 00:49:07.663
<v Regina>Yes, and throughout this whole building</v>

972
00:49:07.663 --> 00:49:09.904
and the whole complex.

973
00:49:09.904 --> 00:49:14.804
Any final thoughts you'd like to share about your journey

974
00:49:14.804 --> 00:49:18.577
of having taken your passion and your ideals and skills

975
00:49:18.577 --> 00:49:22.083
through the lens of Cayce's work?

976
00:49:22.083 --> 00:49:24.916
<v ->Oh gosh, what a big question, how to sum up</v>

977
00:49:24.916 --> 00:49:29.560
in a short couple of statements.

978
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.426
For me, it really is that affirmation of cooperation,

979
00:49:33.426 --> 00:49:36.027
that thy will be done in me and through me.

980
00:49:36.027 --> 00:49:38.500
That I ever be a channel of blessings to those

981
00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:41.506
that I contact in every way and that my will

982
00:49:41.506 --> 00:49:44.309
be in accord with that though would have me do.

983
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:46.875
It really is.

984
00:49:46.875 --> 00:49:49.441
I feel so fortunate and blessed to be

985
00:49:49.441 --> 00:49:53.075
in an environment where I can have that

986
00:49:53.075 --> 00:49:56.720
as my guiding principle day in, day out

987
00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.356
and that that be known and shared in our community,

988
00:49:59.356 --> 00:50:03.547
It's not just me holding that in my little office or space,

989
00:50:03.547 --> 00:50:06.426
but that is something that everyone here

990
00:50:06.426 --> 00:50:09.491
in some way or another is attuned to.

991
00:50:09.491 --> 00:50:11.570
<v Regina>I think that there are people watching right now,</v>

992
00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:14.225
some of our viewers who might even be contemplating

993
00:50:14.225 --> 00:50:18.173
a new career or a change of life career,

994
00:50:18.173 --> 00:50:20.135
or are young and their first career

995
00:50:20.135 --> 00:50:24.106
that are inspired by this.

996
00:50:24.106 --> 00:50:28.784
Does the institute take on new students with regularity?

997
00:50:28.784 --> 00:50:30.108
<v ->Oh, absolutely, yeah.</v>

998
00:50:30.108 --> 00:50:33.150
Our massage program, we're ongoing all throughout the year.

999
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:36.923
We have programs that start three times a year.

1000
00:50:36.923 --> 00:50:38.223
<v Regina>How long do they last?</v>

1001
00:50:38.223 --> 00:50:39.721
<v ->It's an eight month program,</v>

1002
00:50:39.721 --> 00:50:41.962
so it's really relatively short.

1003
00:50:41.962 --> 00:50:46.733
Massage as a career is a great trade and skill to have.

1004
00:50:46.733 --> 00:50:50.658
It's a great profession where one can, practically speaking,

1005
00:50:50.658 --> 00:50:54.024
work a relatively part time schedule, so still have time

1006
00:50:54.024 --> 00:50:58.041
for that work, personal life balance.

1007
00:50:58.041 --> 00:51:00.584
It's very rewarding in that you know you're making

1008
00:51:00.584 --> 00:51:02.744
a positive difference to other people,

1009
00:51:02.744 --> 00:51:07.422
and it's a great stepping stone into any other kind of,

1010
00:51:07.422 --> 00:51:10.522
certainly healthcare profession, or any other kind

1011
00:51:10.522 --> 00:51:14.690
of therapeutic work that you wanna do with people.

1012
00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:18.034
When you learn how to touch someone,

1013
00:51:18.034 --> 00:51:22.806
physically touch them, but touch them in a bigger sense,

1014
00:51:22.806 --> 00:51:25.673
that's a skill that benefits you

1015
00:51:25.673 --> 00:51:28.367
and enhances everything you do in your life.

1016
00:51:28.367 --> 00:51:30.143
<v Regina>As you're saying, you're bringing that energy</v>

1017
00:51:30.143 --> 00:51:31.710
through you, you're a conduit.

1018
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:35.217
You're receiving and giving at the same time.

1019
00:51:35.217 --> 00:51:36.482
<v ->That's right, that's right.</v>

1020
00:51:36.482 --> 00:51:40.580
Whether it's through a massage or just a comforting touch

1021
00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:43.425
on the back, when you learn to be comfortable

1022
00:51:43.425 --> 00:51:46.478
with making contact with people

1023
00:51:46.478 --> 00:51:49.427
and knowing that your intention is coming

1024
00:51:49.427 --> 00:51:51.099
from a greater place,

1025
00:51:51.099 --> 00:51:54.930
there's really nothing more rewarding than that.

1026
00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:58.274
<v Regina>Because it's such a beloved experience</v>

1027
00:51:58.274 --> 00:52:01.072
for people, one thing I've noticed is here we are in

1028
00:52:01.072 --> 00:52:03.440
I think it's fair to say a down turn economy,

1029
00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.217
about four years into it now,

1030
00:52:05.217 --> 00:52:08.410
and the people I know who have the greatest number of trades

1031
00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:12.682
for other services are always the masseurs and masseuses.

1032
00:52:12.682 --> 00:52:14.122
<v ->That's right.</v>

1033
00:52:14.122 --> 00:52:15.956
Economies are gonna go up and down,

1034
00:52:15.956 --> 00:52:19.195
but people's needs, their ailments

1035
00:52:19.195 --> 00:52:21.958
physically and emotionally are always gonna be there,

1036
00:52:21.958 --> 00:52:23.468
sometimes even more so

1037
00:52:23.468 --> 00:52:28.468
in stressful economic and world conditions.

1038
00:52:28.704 --> 00:52:29.888
<v Regina>I'm not saying that as a plug</v>

1039
00:52:29.888 --> 00:52:31.769
to become a massage therapist,

1040
00:52:31.769 --> 00:52:34.505
I'm just saying, I have a lot of friends who do massage

1041
00:52:34.505 --> 00:52:37.115
and I can certainly see that they have no shortage.

1042
00:52:37.115 --> 00:52:39.182
Need a haircut? Let's do a trade.

1043
00:52:39.182 --> 00:52:40.842
Whatever it is, let's do a trade.

1044
00:52:40.842 --> 00:52:44.255
<v ->That's right, ours is the one profession</v>

1045
00:52:44.255 --> 00:52:46.519
that you don't have to hard sell anybody.

1046
00:52:46.519 --> 00:52:47.459
<v Regina>No, you sure don't.</v>

1047
00:52:47.459 --> 00:52:48.690
(laughing)

1048
00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:50.281
<v Regina>Well, I really appreciate your taking the time</v>

1049
00:52:50.281 --> 00:52:51.163
to talk to us.

1050
00:52:51.163 --> 00:52:52.417
We have a conference starting here today

1051
00:52:52.417 --> 00:52:55.134
and so it's a lot of people bustling around.

1052
00:52:55.134 --> 00:52:56.759
Busy time for all of you.

1053
00:52:56.759 --> 00:52:58.361
Thank you so much for your time.

1054
00:52:58.361 --> 00:53:01.763
You make it sound really like quite an enticing thing to do.

1055
00:53:01.763 --> 00:53:06.372
<v ->Well, great, thank you. It was my pleasure.</v>

1056
00:53:06.372 --> 00:53:08.903
<v ->If you should find yourself in Virginia Beach, Virginia,</v>

1057
00:53:08.903 --> 00:53:12.107
you can have a healing massage at the Edgar Cayce Institute

1058
00:53:12.107 --> 00:53:14.313
after a day in the Cayce library.

1059
00:53:14.313 --> 00:53:16.984
If you wish to serve others in a healing capacity,

1060
00:53:16.984 --> 00:53:18.586
you can also check into their

1061
00:53:18.586 --> 00:53:21.059
eight month massotherapy program.

1062
00:53:21.059 --> 00:53:23.323
We could all use a pair of healing hands these days,

1063
00:53:23.323 --> 00:53:24.786
and it may be a worthy endeavor

1064
00:53:24.786 --> 00:53:26.922
for anyone who is naturally nurturing.

1065
00:53:26.922 --> 00:53:31.317
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
