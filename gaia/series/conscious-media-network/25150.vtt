00:00:10.562 --> 00:00:13.264
<v ->We continue our conversation with George Kavassilas</v>

3
00:00:13.264 --> 00:00:15.166
in discussing the highly-prized aspect

4
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.435
of human energy and genetics.

5
00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:19.338
Among the several other topics discussed

6
00:00:19.338 --> 00:00:21.006
in part two of our interview,

7
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.609
is the nature of religious ritual, including Communion,

8
00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:26.277
in which the parishioner consumes

9
00:00:26.277 --> 00:00:29.469
the metaphoric blood and flesh of Christ.

10
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.320
We were talking earlier about

11
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.652
all the different constructs that have

12
00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:37.082
been laid upon our consciousness.

13
00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:41.226
But in the end, the beauty, the love, the innate humanity

14
00:00:41.226 --> 00:00:43.194
within us still comes through the cracks,

15
00:00:43.194 --> 00:00:45.396
it still shines through, even if we've got

16
00:00:45.396 --> 00:00:46.961
a pretty tightly-closed box.

17
00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:47.670
<v ->Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.068
<v Regina>It manages to shine through,</v>

19
00:00:49.068 --> 00:00:53.671
and there is, even more so, this construct

20
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:56.842
that has been created through this density,

21
00:00:56.842 --> 00:01:00.379
or, you call it, "compression," through this compression,

22
00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.081
there's a genetic component to this.

23
00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:06.987
This is, we're being studied by many, many,

24
00:01:06.987 --> 00:01:09.387
regarding the genetics of all of the lifeforms

25
00:01:09.387 --> 00:01:10.655
on this planet.

26
00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:12.189
Let's talk a little bit about that

27
00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.459
before we go into some other constructs.

28
00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:18.963
<v ->Okay. Well, what we have here is, what we've created,</v>

29
00:01:18.963 --> 00:01:21.032
when I say "we," me and a whole lot of bunch

30
00:01:21.032 --> 00:01:23.167
of other beings and races.

31
00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:24.770
It's been a big project.

32
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.239
And together, we created a generic form

33
00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:29.407
that holds all the codes.

34
00:01:29.407 --> 00:01:31.709
And, like we mentioned earlier, any race from out there

35
00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:34.946
can come and incarnate into this human form.

36
00:01:34.946 --> 00:01:37.214
And so, out there on a cosmic level,

37
00:01:37.214 --> 00:01:40.251
when you look at beings who are into power and control,

38
00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:41.290
how do they go about it?

39
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.488
What is, for them, power and control?

40
00:01:43.488 --> 00:01:46.358
'Cause they do it through manipulation of life.

41
00:01:46.358 --> 00:01:48.893
So, do they do it by gold?

42
00:01:48.893 --> 00:01:52.331
You know, on a superficial level gold is important to people

43
00:01:52.331 --> 00:01:56.154
because it gives them monetary power.

44
00:01:56.154 --> 00:01:59.260
But out there, substances

45
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.180
and technology is, only get you so far.

46
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.179
But what really gets them far is accessing life-force.

47
00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:08.780
The manipulation of life-force.

48
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.116
And they do that through genetics.

49
00:02:11.116 --> 00:02:12.450
So, there are groups out there,

50
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.422
intergalactic cabals, who maraud the cosmos,

51
00:02:16.422 --> 00:02:18.522
looking for the best genetics.

52
00:02:18.522 --> 00:02:21.926
So they can manipulate those genetics and access life-force

53
00:02:21.926 --> 00:02:23.862
that they haven't been able to access before.

54
00:02:23.862 --> 00:02:25.430
And not only types of life-force,

55
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.135
but also volume of life-force.

56
00:02:30.135 --> 00:02:32.404
And so, here we have this human race

57
00:02:32.404 --> 00:02:36.107
that has got access to more life-force

58
00:02:36.107 --> 00:02:37.609
than any other race in the universe.

59
00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:39.177
'Cause we have all the codes.

60
00:02:39.177 --> 00:02:41.747
So we access everything.

61
00:02:41.747 --> 00:02:43.908
And for them, it's like, "Haha, goodie!"

62
00:02:43.908 --> 00:02:44.675
<v Regina>Mm-hmm.</v>

63
00:02:44.675 --> 00:02:46.274
<v ->One place that's got it all!
<v Regina>Jackpot.</v>

64
00:02:46.274 --> 00:02:49.353
<v ->The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for them.</v>

65
00:02:49.353 --> 00:02:53.425
And so, our genetics are the most prized possession,

66
00:02:53.425 --> 00:02:55.794
or commodity, for want of a better term,

67
00:02:55.794 --> 00:02:58.629
but in reality it is that way for some races.

68
00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.931
They see us as a commodity.

69
00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:03.467
<v Regina>And our genetics are being</v>

70
00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:05.590
tapped into, harvested?

71
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.537
<v ->Yes.
<v Regina>Hybridized?</v>

72
00:03:06.537 --> 00:03:08.873
Which, we are a hybrid species, so we can't be freaked out

73
00:03:08.873 --> 00:03:11.443
about the notion of hybridization, 'cause we already are.

74
00:03:11.443 --> 00:03:15.517
And the projects continue, it's a matter of "to what end?"

75
00:03:15.517 --> 00:03:16.274
<v ->Yeah.</v>

76
00:03:16.274 --> 00:03:18.516
<v Regina>Which projects, to what end?</v>

77
00:03:18.516 --> 00:03:21.986
<v ->Yeah. Well, with the grays too,</v>

78
00:03:21.986 --> 00:03:24.088
there's a lot of gray races I've had to,

79
00:03:24.088 --> 00:03:25.657
I've had some unfortunate interactions

80
00:03:25.657 --> 00:03:29.527
with cross-gray human hybrids.

81
00:03:29.527 --> 00:03:31.362
Which were unpleasant in nature.

82
00:03:31.362 --> 00:03:33.664
So, there's things like that, that are going on,

83
00:03:33.664 --> 00:03:35.633
and even more gruesome things that are going on,

84
00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:37.658
which I don't wish...
<v Regina>Right, no, we don't</v>

85
00:03:37.658 --> 00:03:38.790
need to go into those.
<v ->It's probably not</v>

86
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.941
appropriate to go into those.

87
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:43.141
<v Regina>Are there also, maybe, elevated forms of that?</v>

88
00:03:43.141 --> 00:03:45.977
Are there some that are hybridized products,

89
00:03:45.977 --> 00:03:47.212
or projects, so to speak?

90
00:03:47.212 --> 00:03:49.714
<v ->They're attempting to achieve that,</v>

91
00:03:49.714 --> 00:03:51.382
but they soon find out in the long run,

92
00:03:51.382 --> 00:03:53.785
that you actually have to incarnate yourself,

93
00:03:53.785 --> 00:03:55.720
and go through the process organically

94
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.093
to achieve that much greater state of things.

95
00:03:58.093 --> 00:03:59.924
<v Regina>Yes. (laughs)</v>

96
00:03:59.924 --> 00:04:01.025
<v ->There's no shortcuts.</v>

97
00:04:01.025 --> 00:04:02.727
That's the beauty of the way this reality

98
00:04:02.727 --> 00:04:05.930
is being constructed, and the way the Creator

99
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.930
has gone about it, that this project is fool-proof.

100
00:04:11.068 --> 00:04:13.917
Even though some people can't see it yet,

101
00:04:13.917 --> 00:04:15.340
we are gonna succeed.

102
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.842
In fact, we already have succeeded,

103
00:04:16.842 --> 00:04:18.643
because the future's already happened.

104
00:04:18.643 --> 00:04:20.077
I know egos have an issue with that,

105
00:04:20.077 --> 00:04:22.280
but the future has already happened.

106
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.685
And we have succeeded, and really there's,

107
00:04:26.685 --> 00:04:30.087
it's fool-proof, it's so full-proof, it's incredible.

108
00:04:30.087 --> 00:04:31.555
And they're studying us because they want

109
00:04:31.555 --> 00:04:33.757
to correct that full-proof process.

110
00:04:33.757 --> 00:04:36.795
They're just always trying to cheat it.

111
00:04:36.795 --> 00:04:41.032
They can't bear the thought of stripping themselves

112
00:04:41.032 --> 00:04:43.034
of everything and incarnating in human form

113
00:04:43.034 --> 00:04:44.473
and going through it themselves.

114
00:04:44.473 --> 00:04:47.706
So they're trying to find a cheat's way of doing it.

115
00:04:47.706 --> 00:04:50.041
<v Regina>And yet, every time a baby's born,</v>

116
00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:52.243
there's this beauty, this light,

117
00:04:52.243 --> 00:04:54.578
this automatic love, and so forth,

118
00:04:54.578 --> 00:04:56.714
it still happens every time with the creation

119
00:04:56.714 --> 00:04:58.449
of each new little body on the planet.

120
00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.921
<v ->Yeah. And here you have these entities and these beings</v>

121
00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:05.290
that have been marauding the cosmos for, some of them,

122
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.225
for hundreds of millions of years,

123
00:05:07.225 --> 00:05:08.926
and some of them billions of years.

124
00:05:08.926 --> 00:05:10.728
And they've empowered themselves so greatly

125
00:05:10.728 --> 00:05:13.098
through manipulation of others.

126
00:05:13.098 --> 00:05:15.571
And here, you have this little baby that gets born on Earth,

127
00:05:15.571 --> 00:05:18.936
that has more power and accesses more life-force

128
00:05:18.936 --> 00:05:21.239
than any entity ever will.

129
00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:23.408
<v Regina>Absolutely. And if you've been at the presence</v>

130
00:05:23.408 --> 00:05:25.577
of a birth, you know it, you feel it,

131
00:05:25.577 --> 00:05:28.713
you burst into tears at the beauty of that being,

132
00:05:28.713 --> 00:05:30.048
and it's not a sentimental one,

133
00:05:30.048 --> 00:05:33.974
there's a power that comes in.

134
00:05:33.974 --> 00:05:37.088
Well, so beyond genetics, now I wanted

135
00:05:37.088 --> 00:05:38.957
to get to the construct of religion.

136
00:05:38.957 --> 00:05:40.559
Because this is a tricky one, and this goes

137
00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:44.007
into new-age religions as well.

138
00:05:44.007 --> 00:05:48.166
You said something that I found really fascinating.

139
00:05:48.166 --> 00:05:50.735
And it's so obvious, it's staring you in the face.

140
00:05:50.735 --> 00:05:54.406
And I was raised as a Missouri Synod Lutheran. Right?

141
00:05:54.406 --> 00:05:57.008
You know, it's just like Catholicism but without the fun.

142
00:05:57.008 --> 00:05:58.876
Without any wine, you can't confess,

143
00:05:58.876 --> 00:06:00.411
you just have to live with your sins.

144
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:02.080
(both laugh)

145
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.829
There's a pretty dour, sorry if there

146
00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:05.817
are any reforming Lutherans out there.

147
00:06:05.817 --> 00:06:08.587
And this whole thing creeped me out,

148
00:06:08.587 --> 00:06:10.255
the whole time I was growing up.

149
00:06:10.255 --> 00:06:13.157
First of all, I didn't resonate with any of it.

150
00:06:13.157 --> 00:06:16.328
I thought Jesus, and Jesus sounds

151
00:06:16.328 --> 00:06:19.163
like a very beautiful being and would not tolerate

152
00:06:19.163 --> 00:06:20.498
what's being done and said here,

153
00:06:20.498 --> 00:06:21.866
and I've always felt that way.

154
00:06:21.866 --> 00:06:24.502
But this whole notion of Communion,

155
00:06:24.502 --> 00:06:29.173
and the eating of the flesh and the blood.

156
00:06:29.173 --> 00:06:32.410
Now, how much more ritualistic...

157
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.112
<v ->Yeah. Yeah.</v>

158
00:06:34.112 --> 00:06:36.582
<v Regina>And we talk about these secret societies</v>

159
00:06:36.582 --> 00:06:38.783
that do these very things and these practices.

160
00:06:38.783 --> 00:06:40.984
And, you go to a church on Sunday,

161
00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:42.945
and millions of people a week, are doing--

162
00:06:42.945 --> 00:06:46.159
<v ->They're doing it every Sunday around the world, it's sick!</v>

163
00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:49.760
And they don't even realize what they're doing. It's...

164
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.095
<v Regina>So let's talk about that a little bit.</v>

165
00:06:51.095 --> 00:06:54.132
How, the religious structures from what you've seen,

166
00:06:54.132 --> 00:06:56.100
again, how they work their way in?

167
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.369
Something as simple as a ritual like this,

168
00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:01.371
that's taking place for us on an unconscious level.

169
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:03.912
You just say, "Here's the body and here's the blood."

170
00:07:03.912 --> 00:07:06.611
And you're supposed to drink it and munch down the wafer.

171
00:07:06.611 --> 00:07:08.712
<v ->Yeah, well see, I did that as a child.</v>

172
00:07:08.712 --> 00:07:11.248
I used to, 'cause I was Christian Greek-Orthodox,

173
00:07:11.248 --> 00:07:12.387
and I went to the church.

174
00:07:12.387 --> 00:07:15.053
And you know, we had little cubes of bread,

175
00:07:15.053 --> 00:07:17.326
and I would eat the bread and then go up

176
00:07:17.326 --> 00:07:18.822
and drink the wine with the priest,

177
00:07:18.822 --> 00:07:20.959
and then all of a sudden, it's like someone

178
00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:22.793
had kicked me and punched me in the stomach.

179
00:07:22.793 --> 00:07:26.239
And I just had this sick feeling go right through me.

180
00:07:26.239 --> 00:07:27.966
I used to think, "This is wrong!"

181
00:07:27.966 --> 00:07:31.902
Like, I'm, something's not right about this.

182
00:07:31.902 --> 00:07:35.239
Thankfully, my parents weren't too strict.

183
00:07:35.239 --> 00:07:36.474
There was a bit of pressure on me

184
00:07:36.474 --> 00:07:39.611
but they weren't fanatical in any way, shape, or form.

185
00:07:39.611 --> 00:07:42.914
Very liberal in a sense, in that way,

186
00:07:42.914 --> 00:07:44.582
in the true meaning of the word.

187
00:07:44.582 --> 00:07:47.452
And allowed me not to have to partake.

188
00:07:47.452 --> 00:07:49.220
So I was really happy about that as a child,

189
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.355
'cause something was not right there.

190
00:07:51.355 --> 00:07:52.623
And just standing in the church,

191
00:07:52.623 --> 00:07:55.866
and just the energy of the church wasn't right either.

192
00:07:55.866 --> 00:07:58.030
I knew that wasn't the house of God.

193
00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.798
'Cause this is the house of God,

194
00:07:59.798 --> 00:08:02.289
your body's the house of God.

195
00:08:02.289 --> 00:08:04.503
And God is everyone and everything.

196
00:08:04.503 --> 00:08:07.844
So, how can just one building be called the house of God?

197
00:08:07.844 --> 00:08:08.983
<v Regina>Well, and often those buildings</v>

198
00:08:08.983 --> 00:08:10.475
are very repressive, energetically.

199
00:08:10.475 --> 00:08:11.776
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

200
00:08:11.776 --> 00:08:13.177
<v Regina>And so, that's one form.</v>

201
00:08:13.177 --> 00:08:15.305
We're only talking Christianity, by the way.

202
00:08:15.305 --> 00:08:16.711
I mean, obviously we're only talking Christianity--

203
00:08:16.711 --> 00:08:18.108
<v ->Well, we grew up in Christendom, yeah.</v>

204
00:08:18.108 --> 00:08:19.424
<v Regina>Yeah, so, we're talking about that--</v>

205
00:08:19.424 --> 00:08:20.662
<v ->It applies in every religion.</v>

206
00:08:20.662 --> 00:08:21.806
<v Regina>Exactly. You can take it</v>

207
00:08:21.806 --> 00:08:22.974
to any country, any religion.

208
00:08:22.974 --> 00:08:24.002
Let's talk about the common themes--

209
00:08:24.002 --> 00:08:26.324
<v ->Even the shamanic, even the indigenous cultures</v>

210
00:08:26.324 --> 00:08:28.360
have the same thing going on.

211
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.428
Not that they do a flesh-and-blood ritual.

212
00:08:30.428 --> 00:08:32.764
But, all their cultural and spiritual teachings

213
00:08:32.764 --> 00:08:34.799
have been twisted and manipulated too.

214
00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:37.201
Like I said, they have not left a stone unturned.

215
00:08:37.201 --> 00:08:41.906
And every single culture has been infected by this virus.

216
00:08:41.906 --> 00:08:43.975
<v Regina>And talk about the commonality of that virus,</v>

217
00:08:43.975 --> 00:08:46.243
in some of the teachings that seem to show up

218
00:08:46.243 --> 00:08:48.913
and are reflected throughout all of the religions.

219
00:08:48.913 --> 00:08:51.516
<v ->Yeah, well the commonality, and this has to do with,</v>

220
00:08:51.516 --> 00:08:56.516
'cause it goes back about 6000, appeared especially.

221
00:08:56.524 --> 00:08:58.523
'Cause it began before that,

222
00:08:58.523 --> 00:09:00.725
before the fall of Atlantis, anyway.

223
00:09:00.725 --> 00:09:03.427
The end of times of Atlantis was all about

224
00:09:03.427 --> 00:09:08.427
these control structures that were coming into play as well.

225
00:09:08.533 --> 00:09:10.472
That sort of energetic patterns were beginning

226
00:09:10.472 --> 00:09:12.838
to be introduced into the Earth-plane.

227
00:09:12.838 --> 00:09:15.773
And started falling and falling away.

228
00:09:15.773 --> 00:09:19.077
But in the last 6000 years, that is where the plan

229
00:09:19.077 --> 00:09:21.545
just went really serious.

230
00:09:21.545 --> 00:09:25.449
And it happened in around Babylon and Sumer,

231
00:09:25.449 --> 00:09:27.517
all those places, where economic collectives

232
00:09:27.517 --> 00:09:31.189
were introduced, and rituals, and spiritual rituals,

233
00:09:31.189 --> 00:09:33.908
and rites were introduced.

234
00:09:33.908 --> 00:09:38.908
The elite were, you know, was really pronounced.

235
00:09:38.916 --> 00:09:43.016
The difference between the ruling priests and the castes

236
00:09:43.016 --> 00:09:45.069
and the general population.

237
00:09:45.069 --> 00:09:50.051
So, the differences were far more pronounced in those times.

238
00:09:50.051 --> 00:09:52.347
So, here you have this agenda.

239
00:09:52.347 --> 00:09:53.453
That's what I said to you before,

240
00:09:53.453 --> 00:09:55.646
people are waiting for the Anti-Christ to turn up,

241
00:09:55.646 --> 00:09:56.913
and they don't realize the Anti-Christ

242
00:09:56.913 --> 00:09:59.751
is running the Vatican and is behind

243
00:09:59.751 --> 00:10:01.719
every religion on the planet.

244
00:10:01.719 --> 00:10:04.408
So, the commonalities that you speak of is,

245
00:10:04.408 --> 00:10:06.090
you have an entity that's claiming

246
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.892
to be the creator of all things.

247
00:10:07.892 --> 00:10:10.895
If you have that model of religious dogma.

248
00:10:10.895 --> 00:10:14.699
And that, we all are subservient to that entity.

249
00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:17.401
So there's that model, and then you have another one

250
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:20.438
which is more of the Eastern philosophies,

251
00:10:20.438 --> 00:10:25.109
which have to do with entering into the mind.

252
00:10:25.109 --> 00:10:28.412
And it's a more sophisticated version,

253
00:10:28.412 --> 00:10:30.748
but what it ends up doing is luring people

254
00:10:30.748 --> 00:10:33.584
into the fourth dimensional cosmic mind matrix.

255
00:10:33.584 --> 00:10:35.686
They don't realize that that's where they're headed.

256
00:10:35.686 --> 00:10:37.755
So you've got these two incredible energies

257
00:10:37.755 --> 00:10:41.792
at play here, they're very sophisticated.

258
00:10:41.792 --> 00:10:43.494
I would actually say that Eastern mind

259
00:10:43.494 --> 00:10:45.139
is more sophisticated than the Western mind.

260
00:10:45.139 --> 00:10:46.810
<v Regina>I think it is, in fact, a lot of people</v>

261
00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.135
in the Eastern one are refugees from the Western one.

262
00:10:50.135 --> 00:10:53.741
Because it offers a seemingly more expansive

263
00:10:53.741 --> 00:10:55.206
thinking and connection.

264
00:10:55.206 --> 00:10:57.542
<v ->Yeah. So you connect to the oneness,</v>

265
00:10:57.542 --> 00:10:58.842
and they say connecting to the all,

266
00:10:58.842 --> 00:11:01.713
I mentioned about being part of the all,

267
00:11:01.713 --> 00:11:03.347
but their version of oneness,

268
00:11:03.347 --> 00:11:05.349
their understanding of what the all is.

269
00:11:05.349 --> 00:11:07.754
And so they connect with this cosmic mind,

270
00:11:07.754 --> 00:11:10.488
and they go traveling the cosmos with their awareness,

271
00:11:10.488 --> 00:11:11.823
which is really the astral awareness

272
00:11:11.823 --> 00:11:13.390
and they don't realize it.

273
00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.432
It's a more higher astral awareness.

274
00:11:15.432 --> 00:11:19.031
They go right back into the blueprint of life,

275
00:11:19.031 --> 00:11:21.165
and the building blocks and foundation of life,

276
00:11:21.165 --> 00:11:23.300
and they think they're talking to God,

277
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.002
and they're actually not.

278
00:11:25.002 --> 00:11:28.896
What they're talking to is a head of a collective.

279
00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:33.896
Who has manifested a paradigm of reality and awareness.

280
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:35.880
That's how clever these entities are.

281
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.082
Remember, we're talking about epochs and eons

282
00:11:39.082 --> 00:11:43.420
and eras of evolution in this universe that is so old.

283
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:47.057
And these beings, these entities, are no dummies.

284
00:11:47.057 --> 00:11:48.172
<v Regina>Patient.</v>

285
00:11:48.172 --> 00:11:49.389
<v ->Pardon?
<v Regina>They're patient.</v>

286
00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:51.963
<v ->They're very patient. They're very, very patient.</v>

287
00:11:51.963 --> 00:11:55.330
But, now they're not, and they're losing their patience,

288
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.101
and they've lost their patience because the one race

289
00:11:58.101 --> 00:12:00.939
that feeds them more than any other race ever has,

290
00:12:00.939 --> 00:12:04.475
that's given them more power than they've ever had,

291
00:12:04.475 --> 00:12:07.178
is now, this is right at the very end.

292
00:12:07.178 --> 00:12:09.446
And they're here to harvest their human herd.

293
00:12:09.446 --> 00:12:11.048
And they wanna do that.

294
00:12:11.048 --> 00:12:13.784
And what we're to do is to help people

295
00:12:13.784 --> 00:12:15.786
to stand in their own power and their own right,

296
00:12:15.786 --> 00:12:19.289
reclaim their sovereignty, and break free from these,

297
00:12:19.289 --> 00:12:22.493
the clutches and the lures of these paradigms of awareness.

298
00:12:22.493 --> 00:12:24.381
Because they've created minis.

299
00:12:24.381 --> 00:12:27.066
The way I present it, you get a bubble, a bigger bubble.

300
00:12:27.066 --> 00:12:28.932
And then a little bubble and a smaller bubble.

301
00:12:28.932 --> 00:12:31.836
It's kind of a bubble within a bubble within a bubble.

302
00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:34.805
And so, the larger bubble is, you have these,

303
00:12:34.805 --> 00:12:38.409
oh, let me explain it like that, like this.

304
00:12:38.409 --> 00:12:41.780
You get a merkabah, right? Create a merkabah vehicle.

305
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.382
You step into it, you got a light-body, right?

306
00:12:44.382 --> 00:12:46.150
Let's say you expand that merkabah,

307
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.820
then you ask someone else to join you in that merkabah.

308
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.491
And then you got two of the energies, the energies

309
00:12:50.491 --> 00:12:53.291
of two beings feeding that merkabah, it expands, right?

310
00:12:53.291 --> 00:12:55.795
Wonderful. And you all go in there and you bliss out.

311
00:12:55.795 --> 00:12:58.163
Then you get somebody else and you expand it again.

312
00:12:58.163 --> 00:13:00.398
Then you bring someone else in, expand it again.

313
00:13:00.398 --> 00:13:03.367
Then you bring 20 people into that and expand it again.

314
00:13:03.367 --> 00:13:06.336
So, what you're now creating is a synthetic light construct,

315
00:13:06.336 --> 00:13:09.173
'cause you used a mathematical template to create it,

316
00:13:09.173 --> 00:13:11.542
known as the markabah vehicle, okay?

317
00:13:11.542 --> 00:13:12.910
'Cause there's a big difference between

318
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.178
labeling something with a merkabah,

319
00:13:15.178 --> 00:13:16.815
and actually manufacturing something

320
00:13:16.815 --> 00:13:18.425
via the merkabah template.

321
00:13:18.425 --> 00:13:20.685
Very big difference between the two.

322
00:13:20.685 --> 00:13:22.887
'Cause the moment you create and you manufacture

323
00:13:22.887 --> 00:13:26.290
a light-body using a mathematical template,

324
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.093
you are creating a synthetic light construct.

325
00:13:29.093 --> 00:13:30.663
<v Regina>Right. Artificial construct.</v>

326
00:13:30.663 --> 00:13:32.056
<v ->Artificial construct, right?</v>

327
00:13:32.056 --> 00:13:33.023
<v Regina>Makes sense, yeah.</v>

328
00:13:33.023 --> 00:13:34.498
<v ->Now, these have, and we're doing,</v>

329
00:13:34.498 --> 00:13:36.602
people are doing it now here on the planet, right?

330
00:13:36.602 --> 00:13:38.854
So, you imagine over billions and trillions

331
00:13:38.854 --> 00:13:40.738
of years of evolution in the universe,

332
00:13:40.738 --> 00:13:42.440
what's been able to be created.

333
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.763
So, when I talk about my fourth dimenion, you know,

334
00:13:45.763 --> 00:13:48.679
these paradigms have grown so big,

335
00:13:48.679 --> 00:13:50.781
and they've assimilated thousands

336
00:13:50.781 --> 00:13:52.616
of extraterrestrial races in them.

337
00:13:52.616 --> 00:13:54.685
They have many, many layers of reality,

338
00:13:54.685 --> 00:13:58.456
which can be perceived as dimensional frequencies.

339
00:13:58.456 --> 00:14:00.633
And when you go inside one of these constructs

340
00:14:00.633 --> 00:14:03.727
and you look up, you will see spiritual hierarchies.

341
00:14:03.727 --> 00:14:05.762
Ascended masters, angelic hierarchies,

342
00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:09.334
you have life spanning so many different levels

343
00:14:09.334 --> 00:14:12.970
of frequencies, that you are, you think with your awareness,

344
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:15.773
you're looking up in a universe.

345
00:14:15.773 --> 00:14:17.741
It's incredible what has been created.

346
00:14:17.741 --> 00:14:20.444
These people are no dummies, these entities.

347
00:14:20.444 --> 00:14:22.647
And they sit at the top and they play God.

348
00:14:22.647 --> 00:14:25.896
And they just feed off the energy of all these races.

349
00:14:25.896 --> 00:14:26.948
Like, I'll give you an example.

350
00:14:26.948 --> 00:14:30.320
ET races are coming here, right, for example.

351
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.588
And they go, "Oh, we're gonna give you

352
00:14:31.588 --> 00:14:33.390
"these new technologies, and we're gonna

353
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:36.693
"clean up the Earth, and everything's gonna be beautiful.

354
00:14:36.693 --> 00:14:38.412
"You're gonna return back to nature.

355
00:14:38.412 --> 00:14:41.399
"We're gonna save you," so to speak.

356
00:14:41.399 --> 00:14:43.934
Well, I had a meeting, actually, with an ambassador

357
00:14:43.934 --> 00:14:45.436
from one of these paradigms,

358
00:14:45.436 --> 00:14:47.505
which he calls a parallel universe,

359
00:14:47.505 --> 00:14:49.673
that's what I call a parallel universe,

360
00:14:49.673 --> 00:14:51.808
but I know they're just another paradigm,

361
00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:54.412
which is like a, you could call it

362
00:14:54.412 --> 00:14:58.348
like a mutated growth within this universe, okay?

363
00:14:58.348 --> 00:15:02.783
And he said that they've had massive, massive meetings

364
00:15:02.783 --> 00:15:07.658
in the spiritual hierarchies and the council meetings.

365
00:15:07.658 --> 00:15:09.927
So you can imagine like a scene out of Star Wars,

366
00:15:09.927 --> 00:15:11.728
where you've got this massive arena,

367
00:15:11.728 --> 00:15:14.964
thousands of representatives from all different races

368
00:15:14.964 --> 00:15:17.935
within that universal paradigm, okay?

369
00:15:17.935 --> 00:15:22.187
And they're deliberating their plan

370
00:15:22.187 --> 00:15:26.957
on coming to Earth to implement their infrastructures

371
00:15:26.957 --> 00:15:31.917
and their technologies to "help" the human race.

372
00:15:31.917 --> 00:15:35.621
And I said to him, and this is an ambassador, like we were,

373
00:15:35.621 --> 00:15:37.021
'cause I'm part of the galactic council,

374
00:15:37.021 --> 00:15:40.959
so we were functioning on that capacity

375
00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:42.826
and we had this meeting in Sweden.

376
00:15:42.826 --> 00:15:45.896
And I said to him, "Okay, that's really nice that you

377
00:15:45.896 --> 00:15:47.832
"and your people wanna do that.

378
00:15:47.832 --> 00:15:51.002
"But tell me, at that meeting, was the consciousness

379
00:15:51.002 --> 00:15:53.838
"of this planet present at that meeting,

380
00:15:53.838 --> 00:15:57.976
"attending that meeting, and participating in that meeting?

381
00:15:57.976 --> 00:15:59.710
"And was the consciousness of the being

382
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:03.513
"that is the solar system present at that meeting,

383
00:16:03.513 --> 00:16:06.450
"conscious there, and participating in that meeting?"

384
00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:08.218
And he just sat back in his chair.

385
00:16:08.218 --> 00:16:10.762
He went, "Oh, well I hope so."

386
00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:12.322
Well, I mean, if he's an ambassador and he was

387
00:16:12.322 --> 00:16:14.659
at the meeting, he'd know whether they were there or not.

388
00:16:14.659 --> 00:16:17.132
So the point I'm trying to make here,

389
00:16:17.132 --> 00:16:20.064
is that you've got these ETs that are coming here.

390
00:16:20.064 --> 00:16:22.633
They've got good ideologies, okay?

391
00:16:22.633 --> 00:16:24.935
They might mean well on my level,

392
00:16:24.935 --> 00:16:28.806
but their functionality is on such a shallow level,

393
00:16:28.806 --> 00:16:30.741
that they don't even ask the planet permission

394
00:16:30.741 --> 00:16:33.166
to come and do this to the body.

395
00:16:33.166 --> 00:16:34.718
If you're going to implement infrastructures,

396
00:16:34.718 --> 00:16:37.615
you're gonna implement technologies,

397
00:16:37.615 --> 00:16:42.219
you just gotta, you do one thing, it affects that thing.

398
00:16:42.219 --> 00:16:43.787
Just one thing, it'll affect that thing.

399
00:16:43.787 --> 00:16:44.988
And if anybody does anything to you,

400
00:16:44.988 --> 00:16:47.758
it affects you in one way or another.

401
00:16:47.758 --> 00:16:50.594
So, it's very, very important that what gets left

402
00:16:50.594 --> 00:16:52.530
out of the picture, people can understand,

403
00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.431
they've got the whole consciousness of the planet

404
00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:58.136
and the solar system, that they want to go inside of.

405
00:16:58.136 --> 00:17:00.471
So the body of the being that is the solar system,

406
00:17:00.471 --> 00:17:03.408
they're going inside that body.

407
00:17:03.408 --> 00:17:06.210
And they're going to go to a planetary body,

408
00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:08.279
and they wanna implement their infrastructures,

409
00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:11.248
their cultural philosophies, spiritual teachings,

410
00:17:11.248 --> 00:17:14.685
onto the populace and the human race on that planet,

411
00:17:14.685 --> 00:17:16.654
and they didn't even ask permission.

412
00:17:16.654 --> 00:17:18.755
That's the point I'm trying to make.

413
00:17:18.755 --> 00:17:22.443
So, these beings while they, because of what,

414
00:17:22.443 --> 00:17:26.583
we've been plunged into such a limited state of awareness,

415
00:17:26.583 --> 00:17:28.799
when they come along we think it's a wonderful thing.

416
00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:31.068
All this fantastic technology and everything.

417
00:17:31.068 --> 00:17:32.602
But people don't realize that these beings

418
00:17:32.602 --> 00:17:35.008
are coming from a very, very limited paradigm.

419
00:17:35.008 --> 00:17:36.640
One of those paradigms.

420
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.009
And they have their God construct

421
00:17:39.009 --> 00:17:40.710
going on, on these paradigms.

422
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.545
That's why you have ascended masters,

423
00:17:42.545 --> 00:17:45.082
that's why you have angels that are now,

424
00:17:45.082 --> 00:17:47.284
there's a whole plethora of them

425
00:17:47.284 --> 00:17:48.852
presenting themselves on this planet.

426
00:17:48.852 --> 00:17:51.722
And they are luring people into that paradigm

427
00:17:51.722 --> 00:17:54.191
and other paradigms associated to them.

428
00:17:54.191 --> 00:17:55.605
<v Regina>And this is what you're calling</v>

429
00:17:55.605 --> 00:17:59.998
the fifth, and even into the fourth dimensional fields?

430
00:17:59.998 --> 00:18:01.032
<v ->It's not fifth dimension.</v>

431
00:18:01.032 --> 00:18:03.301
All these paradigms are still within that fourth dimension.

432
00:18:03.301 --> 00:18:05.155
<v Regina>That fourth dimensional field, okay.</v>

433
00:18:05.155 --> 00:18:08.839
But, you said in your talk, that in the lower levels

434
00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:11.082
of the fifth, for example, is where evil starts showing up.

435
00:18:11.082 --> 00:18:12.853
But let's talk about more of the fourth dimensional--

436
00:18:12.853 --> 00:18:14.278
<v ->There's no evil in the fifth at all.</v>

437
00:18:14.278 --> 00:18:16.347
The only thing that can occur there is,

438
00:18:16.347 --> 00:18:18.014
there may be a difference of opinion.

439
00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:19.684
And the moment that does occur,

440
00:18:19.684 --> 00:18:21.218
those beings are on their way down.

441
00:18:21.218 --> 00:18:22.290
<v Regina>So that goes down</v>

442
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:23.440
into the fourth dimensional field?

443
00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.724
<v ->Yeah.
<v Regina>Okay, gotcha. So...</v>

444
00:18:26.724 --> 00:18:28.358
<v ->And when I say difference of opinion,</v>

445
00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:31.227
it's so minor compared to what we experience here.

446
00:18:31.227 --> 00:18:34.465
Yeah, like minor, minor. Yeah.

447
00:18:34.465 --> 00:18:36.267
<v Regina>Now I wanted, there are a few things</v>

448
00:18:36.267 --> 00:18:37.167
I want to get back to,

449
00:18:37.167 --> 00:18:39.470
to kind of come to where we are right now.

450
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.024
You talked about the world's religions,

451
00:18:41.024 --> 00:18:42.308
and you talked about how each of those

452
00:18:42.308 --> 00:18:44.708
suck us back into this mind matrix,

453
00:18:44.708 --> 00:18:47.144
an artificial construct that's been created.

454
00:18:47.144 --> 00:18:48.946
Through either good intention or not so good,

455
00:18:48.946 --> 00:18:50.848
it's still been created.

456
00:18:50.848 --> 00:18:55.788
And, as opposed to our natural state of being.

457
00:18:55.788 --> 00:18:58.822
Which happens, is manifested in a baby, for example.

458
00:18:58.822 --> 00:19:00.223
The birth of a baby.

459
00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:03.827
But, at the same time, you've said that Jesus

460
00:19:03.827 --> 00:19:08.299
and Buddha, and Krishna, and Horus,

461
00:19:08.299 --> 00:19:12.209
and perhaps Akhenaten, are all the same being,

462
00:19:12.209 --> 00:19:15.573
the embodiment of the sun.

463
00:19:15.573 --> 00:19:16.641
<v ->Yes.</v>

464
00:19:16.641 --> 00:19:19.275
<v Regina>So this all the same being who has come through.</v>

465
00:19:19.275 --> 00:19:21.511
These are the very ones that are being worshiped

466
00:19:21.511 --> 00:19:23.013
throughout the world's traditions.

467
00:19:23.013 --> 00:19:24.781
<v ->But they did not create the religions.</v>

468
00:19:24.781 --> 00:19:26.515
<v Regina>Exactly, and nor did they ever ask to be,</v>

469
00:19:26.515 --> 00:19:27.388
and I think in each case--

470
00:19:27.388 --> 00:19:28.429
<v ->They did not say to worship--</v>

471
00:19:28.429 --> 00:19:30.254
<v Regina>No one ever said anything about worship.</v>

472
00:19:30.254 --> 00:19:32.689
<v ->Neither did, no, and neither did Isis,</v>

473
00:19:32.689 --> 00:19:35.292
and neither did Mary Magdalene, neither did

474
00:19:35.292 --> 00:19:36.994
any of the feminine aspects

475
00:19:36.994 --> 00:19:38.829
of the one-in-the-same consciousness.

476
00:19:38.829 --> 00:19:42.267
So, what happens here, you've got the priestly caste.

477
00:19:42.267 --> 00:19:43.634
And that's the point I was trying to make

478
00:19:43.634 --> 00:19:45.569
when we were in the Christendom version,

479
00:19:45.569 --> 00:19:49.039
if I can use that as another example.

480
00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:50.364
You have the ancient priesthood.

481
00:19:50.364 --> 00:19:54.211
And, you know, the reason why Jesus threw those tables

482
00:19:54.211 --> 00:19:56.514
outside the temples was not because of the money-changers,

483
00:19:56.514 --> 00:19:58.382
that was one reason, but the main reason

484
00:19:58.382 --> 00:20:01.385
was is people were buying animals.

485
00:20:01.385 --> 00:20:03.453
And taking these animals into the temples

486
00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:07.124
and sacrificing the animals in a flesh-and-blood ritual.

487
00:20:07.124 --> 00:20:08.325
Well, what I want to say to people,

488
00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:09.860
is you gotta be pretty naive to think

489
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:10.961
that the modern-day priesthood

490
00:20:10.961 --> 00:20:12.349
is any different from the old one.

491
00:20:12.349 --> 00:20:13.397
<v Regina>It's still going on.</v>

492
00:20:13.397 --> 00:20:14.731
<v ->It's the same priesthood.</v>

493
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:17.534
The same priesthood that crucified Jesus

494
00:20:17.534 --> 00:20:20.069
is the same priesthood that's running the churches today,

495
00:20:20.069 --> 00:20:21.151
all around the world.

496
00:20:21.151 --> 00:20:22.373
<v Regina>And you could argue that,</v>

497
00:20:22.373 --> 00:20:24.708
even on an incarnation level,

498
00:20:24.708 --> 00:20:27.281
that the same players are still playing.

499
00:20:27.281 --> 00:20:29.019
<v ->Oh, yeah. Yeah.</v>

500
00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:30.988
<v Regina>And I see evidence of that.</v>

501
00:20:30.988 --> 00:20:32.516
<v ->The energy's the same.</v>

502
00:20:32.516 --> 00:20:35.385
So the same entity that ran those ancient priesthoods,

503
00:20:35.385 --> 00:20:37.286
is the same entity that's running the Vatican

504
00:20:37.286 --> 00:20:40.591
and other church structures, and religious organizations

505
00:20:40.591 --> 00:20:42.560
on the planet in other cultures.

506
00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.491
<v Regina>And I think that's important, that continuity</v>

507
00:20:44.491 --> 00:20:46.630
piece of the picture is really important.

508
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:49.266
<v ->Ah, it's incredibly, 'cause I say to people,</v>

509
00:20:49.266 --> 00:20:51.684
"Look, you're waiting for the Anti-Christ to turn up,

510
00:20:51.684 --> 00:20:55.840
"it's already here, it's running the church."

511
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.642
And it's obvious, just think of it from the bigger plan,

512
00:20:58.642 --> 00:21:02.079
if you were the Anti-Christ, wouldn't you entrench,

513
00:21:02.079 --> 00:21:03.948
into the psyche of the people,

514
00:21:03.948 --> 00:21:07.392
your personality and character of the deity,

515
00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:09.286
so when the real one was to come along,

516
00:21:09.286 --> 00:21:11.521
you would make it look like the Anti-Christ.

517
00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:12.759
<v Regina>Yeah, pretty much.</v>

518
00:21:12.759 --> 00:21:15.192
<v ->Duh! You don't have to be--</v>

519
00:21:15.192 --> 00:21:16.287
<v Regina>It's good strategy.</v>

520
00:21:16.287 --> 00:21:17.662
<v ->Ah, it's so obvious!</v>

521
00:21:17.662 --> 00:21:20.631
I think it's an obvious game-plan.

522
00:21:20.631 --> 00:21:23.100
<v Regina>So, meanwhile, these beings,</v>

523
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.304
metaphysical, walking manifestations of the sun, as you say,

524
00:21:27.304 --> 00:21:31.575
such as all of these people from the last 6000 years,

525
00:21:31.575 --> 00:21:32.975
that have walked the face of the Earth,

526
00:21:32.975 --> 00:21:34.511
and religions have been created

527
00:21:34.511 --> 00:21:37.046
around who people kill each other in the name of it.

528
00:21:37.046 --> 00:21:40.083
Etcetera, etcetera, including Akhenaten, which I think

529
00:21:40.083 --> 00:21:42.019
is not one that would normally be included in that,

530
00:21:42.019 --> 00:21:45.356
and is often, in conspiracy circles, even vilified,

531
00:21:45.356 --> 00:21:47.892
because he's credited with monotheism,

532
00:21:47.892 --> 00:21:48.959
which was not the point at all--

533
00:21:48.959 --> 00:21:50.367
<v ->He did not do that at all.</v>

534
00:21:50.367 --> 00:21:51.814
<v Regina>No, that wasn't the point.</v>

535
00:21:51.814 --> 00:21:53.529
Thank you, would you please put this on the record?

536
00:21:53.529 --> 00:21:55.970
<v ->I will categorically state that Ahkenaten</v>

537
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:58.970
did not create monotheistic religion.

538
00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.004
Absolutely did not do that.

539
00:22:01.004 --> 00:22:02.840
Categorically, I will state that.

540
00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.276
That is absolute truth, it is absolute fact.

541
00:22:06.276 --> 00:22:10.280
It is just, that they're trying to pin that sort of,

542
00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.917
those sort of ideas and concepts onto that man,

543
00:22:12.917 --> 00:22:14.885
because what he did was a wonderful thing.

544
00:22:14.885 --> 00:22:18.355
<v Regina>Well, because he is a pagan sun-worshiper.</v>

545
00:22:18.355 --> 00:22:20.604
And this has become, this is interesting, the whole--

546
00:22:20.604 --> 00:22:22.005
<v ->Oh, come on.
<v Regina>Misunderstandings</v>

547
00:22:22.005 --> 00:22:23.310
about the sun--
<v ->The Christian religion</v>

548
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.199
is full of pagan rituals.

549
00:22:24.199 --> 00:22:25.495
<v Regina>Of course it is.</v>

550
00:22:25.495 --> 00:22:26.521
<v ->What's Easter?</v>

551
00:22:26.521 --> 00:22:27.397
<v Regina>Right, exactly.</v>

552
00:22:27.397 --> 00:22:29.301
<v ->Yeah, it's the first Sunday of the first full moon</v>

553
00:22:29.301 --> 00:22:30.871
after the equinox.
<v Regina>What's Christmas?</v>

554
00:22:30.871 --> 00:22:32.636
<v ->What's Christmas? The solstice.</v>

555
00:22:32.636 --> 00:22:34.209
<v Regina>So, we know that that's going on</v>

556
00:22:34.209 --> 00:22:36.440
and we accept it in our particular lure,

557
00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.208
that we may want to attach to as a religion

558
00:22:39.208 --> 00:22:40.971
for whatever our personal reasons may be.

559
00:22:40.971 --> 00:22:43.993
But, with Ahkenaten, this was one of the more direct links

560
00:22:43.993 --> 00:22:47.184
back to the understanding of the consciousness

561
00:22:47.184 --> 00:22:48.986
of the sun and the solar system

562
00:22:48.986 --> 00:22:50.854
that we're part of and folded in.

563
00:22:50.854 --> 00:22:53.617
And that we express in our own beings.

564
00:22:53.617 --> 00:22:55.405
<v ->Yes, exactly, you voiced that perfectly--</v>

565
00:22:55.405 --> 00:22:56.428
<v Regina>And that's the sun.</v>

566
00:22:56.428 --> 00:22:57.935
<v ->Yes it is.</v>

567
00:22:57.935 --> 00:22:59.529
<v Regina>So, this is not monotheism.</v>

568
00:22:59.529 --> 00:23:00.737
<v ->It's not monotheism.</v>

569
00:23:00.737 --> 00:23:01.464
(both laugh)

570
00:23:01.464 --> 00:23:03.434
It's got, no, it hasn't got anything to do with that.

571
00:23:03.434 --> 00:23:04.835
It's got to do with the understanding

572
00:23:04.835 --> 00:23:07.397
of the construct of life.

573
00:23:07.397 --> 00:23:08.938
When Ahkenaten's there in that picture

574
00:23:08.938 --> 00:23:10.307
and he's got his hands up.

575
00:23:10.307 --> 00:23:12.075
It was this way actually. And he's got his hands,

576
00:23:12.075 --> 00:23:13.209
no, no, it was this way.

577
00:23:13.209 --> 00:23:15.145
Depends which still lay you're gonna look at.

578
00:23:15.145 --> 00:23:16.383
One of them is this way.

579
00:23:16.383 --> 00:23:18.315
And he's got the sun there and the rays coming down.

580
00:23:18.315 --> 00:23:20.619
He's kinda like that, that wasn't worshiping the sun.

581
00:23:20.619 --> 00:23:23.487
That's explaining the construct of life

582
00:23:23.487 --> 00:23:26.189
and light in our solar system.

583
00:23:26.189 --> 00:23:27.857
<v Regina>You and I are on the same page on that one.</v>

584
00:23:27.857 --> 00:23:30.460
I'm really happy you went ahead and said that.

585
00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:34.764
<v ->And, yeah, him and Nefertiti came here at the beginning</v>

586
00:23:34.764 --> 00:23:36.400
of the cycle, I may have mentioned that earlier--

587
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.510
<v Regina>Yes, in the beginning.</v>

588
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:38.509
<v ->Yeah, and set everything up.</v>

589
00:23:38.509 --> 00:23:41.044
And that was the Garden of Eden.

590
00:23:41.044 --> 00:23:41.769
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

591
00:23:41.769 --> 00:23:45.106
<v ->Life on planet Earth, while they were here</v>

592
00:23:45.106 --> 00:23:50.071
setting things up was the Garden of Eden.

593
00:23:50.071 --> 00:23:53.156
<v Regina>And since then, we have fallen from grace,</v>

594
00:23:53.156 --> 00:23:55.319
(laughs) so to speak.

595
00:23:55.319 --> 00:23:57.054
And I wanna get into this, I'm gonna stay

596
00:23:57.054 --> 00:23:59.389
on this religious theme, because now we go through the time.

597
00:23:59.389 --> 00:24:02.659
And you gave a talk, in the talk that I saw.

598
00:24:02.659 --> 00:24:04.762
You were talking about the relationship

599
00:24:04.762 --> 00:24:08.181
of Jesus and Mary Magdalene.

600
00:24:08.181 --> 00:24:09.395
And you were talking about something

601
00:24:09.395 --> 00:24:11.165
that really kind of surprised people.

602
00:24:11.165 --> 00:24:13.149
And I think maybe that's one

603
00:24:13.149 --> 00:24:14.404
of your more challenging areas

604
00:24:14.404 --> 00:24:17.165
for anyone who has been a Christian.

605
00:24:17.165 --> 00:24:17.908
<v ->Yeah.</v>

606
00:24:17.908 --> 00:24:19.609
<v Regina>Or still remains a Christian.</v>

607
00:24:19.609 --> 00:24:21.344
Can you talk about what happened, as the entity

608
00:24:21.344 --> 00:24:22.880
of Jesus, representing the sun,

609
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.795
Mary Magdalene, representing the Earth,

610
00:24:24.795 --> 00:24:27.818
the crucifixion you see in a whole different way.

611
00:24:27.818 --> 00:24:31.121
<v ->Yeah. Well, he definitely died a man.</v>

612
00:24:31.121 --> 00:24:34.159
And he definitely did not resurrect.

613
00:24:34.159 --> 00:24:35.570
You know, that's a biggie for a lot

614
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:39.228
of the Christians to handle, because of the whole ideology

615
00:24:39.228 --> 00:24:42.600
of what transpired then is based on that resurrection.

616
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.570
So, why would He come here and go through a process

617
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:49.140
to become something that He already is?

618
00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.744
It is us who are aspiring to become like Him.

619
00:24:51.744 --> 00:24:55.145
Or, the Christ-consciousness.

620
00:24:55.145 --> 00:24:56.583
So, He's already that.

621
00:24:56.583 --> 00:24:58.417
So, He didn't need to go through the process

622
00:24:58.417 --> 00:25:01.584
to become that, if you know what I'm saying.

623
00:25:01.584 --> 00:25:05.255
So, what He did, he came to the Earth at that time,

624
00:25:05.255 --> 00:25:09.092
and during his life he accessed his light-body.

625
00:25:09.092 --> 00:25:10.894
Not after he died.

626
00:25:10.894 --> 00:25:12.695
And you'd be surprised how many people are going,

627
00:25:12.695 --> 00:25:15.932
"You know what, that's what I've always thought too."

628
00:25:15.932 --> 00:25:18.134
He bi-located all around the planet.

629
00:25:18.134 --> 00:25:20.697
They called him Quetzalcoatl in the Americas.

630
00:25:20.697 --> 00:25:22.772
The rainbow serpent in Australia.

631
00:25:22.772 --> 00:25:24.307
Issa in India.

632
00:25:24.307 --> 00:25:28.446
They had all different names for him all over the world.

633
00:25:28.446 --> 00:25:31.147
There are certain people who have tried,

634
00:25:31.147 --> 00:25:33.383
who wanted to do nothing else,

635
00:25:33.383 --> 00:25:36.185
but wipe all memory of his existence

636
00:25:36.185 --> 00:25:37.721
from the planet at the time,

637
00:25:37.721 --> 00:25:38.955
so they could sell their version

638
00:25:38.955 --> 00:25:42.459
of what transpired, in one book. Like, come on.

639
00:25:42.459 --> 00:25:44.861
<v Regina>Unfortunately, it's already been recorded</v>

640
00:25:44.861 --> 00:25:46.329
in India and other places.

641
00:25:46.329 --> 00:25:49.399
<v ->Yeah, yeah. People just gotta think bigger.</v>

642
00:25:49.399 --> 00:25:51.587
They just gotta, yeah, they just gotta, yeah.

643
00:25:51.587 --> 00:25:53.023
<v Regina>Let's talk about that part of it</v>

644
00:25:53.023 --> 00:25:55.172
with Mary Magdalene, and what was,

645
00:25:55.172 --> 00:25:56.706
the relationship between the sun

646
00:25:56.706 --> 00:25:59.009
and the Earth consciousness, and what happened there.

647
00:25:59.009 --> 00:26:01.883
<v ->Well it's, yeah, this is really deep and powerful,</v>

648
00:26:01.883 --> 00:26:04.917
because He was the walking incarnation of the sun,

649
00:26:04.917 --> 00:26:06.650
and Mary Magdalene's the walking incarnation

650
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:10.720
of Mother Earth, and they're twin flames.

651
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.169
The two, the masculine and feminine expression

652
00:26:13.169 --> 00:26:14.397
of the Creator.

653
00:26:14.397 --> 00:26:16.727
And isn't it convenient that they called

654
00:26:16.727 --> 00:26:18.462
Mary Magdalene a prostitute?

655
00:26:18.462 --> 00:26:22.933
So, it's all about putting down the feminine.

656
00:26:22.933 --> 00:26:25.134
I think it's fascinating if you just look

657
00:26:25.134 --> 00:26:27.537
at how they go about it.

658
00:26:27.537 --> 00:26:30.912
It's quite revealing, they expose themselves.

659
00:26:30.912 --> 00:26:32.309
If you just take a look at the way

660
00:26:32.309 --> 00:26:34.744
they're actually going about it.

661
00:26:34.744 --> 00:26:38.782
So, here is a man who, as the sun,

662
00:26:38.782 --> 00:26:40.751
comes to the Earth.

663
00:26:40.751 --> 00:26:43.286
Does what He needs to do to re-calibrate the way

664
00:26:43.286 --> 00:26:46.728
this reality is flowing, is moving forward.

665
00:26:46.728 --> 00:26:50.293
And then goes back to being a man.

666
00:26:50.293 --> 00:26:52.262
So, Arthur holding, you know, giving the sword

667
00:26:52.262 --> 00:26:53.830
back to the Lady of the Lake.

668
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:58.304
So He hands back over to the divine feminine,

669
00:26:58.304 --> 00:27:01.605
who is the gatekeeper to accessing the sacred waters.

670
00:27:01.605 --> 00:27:03.560
'Cause it's the feminine that does the baptizing,

671
00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.277
by the way, and not the masculine.

672
00:27:06.277 --> 00:27:08.712
And, He then went through the process

673
00:27:08.712 --> 00:27:11.669
of dying and being nailed to that cross.

674
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:13.584
And the crucifix is the sword.

675
00:27:13.584 --> 00:27:16.619
Which is the knowledge, it is the wisdom, it is the truth.

676
00:27:16.619 --> 00:27:18.755
And is Logos.

677
00:27:18.755 --> 00:27:20.924
So, when you speak the blueprint of life,

678
00:27:20.924 --> 00:27:23.860
it cuts through the lies and the illusion.

679
00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.695
And that's what the sword represents throughout time.

680
00:27:25.695 --> 00:27:30.367
The sword of Troy, samurai, the way of the sword,

681
00:27:30.367 --> 00:27:32.535
Muhammad said, "Spread Islam by the sword."

682
00:27:32.535 --> 00:27:35.305
Didn't mean go around killing people, of course.

683
00:27:35.305 --> 00:27:39.376
It is spreading the word through wisdom and through Logos.

684
00:27:39.376 --> 00:27:42.079
So, that's what the real Word of God is,

685
00:27:42.079 --> 00:27:46.215
it's the word, it's the sound, it's the blueprint of life.

686
00:27:46.215 --> 00:27:49.386
And so, when He was nailed to that cross,

687
00:27:49.386 --> 00:27:53.924
what it was, was the masculine, the man, the husband,

688
00:27:53.924 --> 00:27:57.028
dying and stepping back from His wife.

689
00:27:57.028 --> 00:28:00.164
And that's what it represents.

690
00:28:00.164 --> 00:28:02.032
<v Regina>To leave her, to be pillaged?</v>

691
00:28:02.032 --> 00:28:03.633
<v ->To be marauded by others.</v>

692
00:28:03.633 --> 00:28:06.403
And that's why it heralded the next phase

693
00:28:06.403 --> 00:28:08.804
of the Dark Ages, the real deep, dark descent

694
00:28:08.804 --> 00:28:10.075
that took place after that,

695
00:28:10.075 --> 00:28:13.142
for the next millennium-and-a-half.

696
00:28:13.142 --> 00:28:16.179
And even more, 'cause it wasn't until about 300 years ago

697
00:28:16.179 --> 00:28:19.265
we had the Renaissance and we started ascending again.

698
00:28:19.265 --> 00:28:24.265
So, it really, because the version of His sacrifice

699
00:28:24.271 --> 00:28:27.019
for our sins, and He was beaten and tortured and all that,

700
00:28:27.019 --> 00:28:28.795
it's not enough, for me.

701
00:28:28.795 --> 00:28:31.459
It isn't. Because I've been tortured real bad in this life.

702
00:28:31.459 --> 00:28:33.268
I know what it feels like to be tortured.

703
00:28:33.268 --> 00:28:37.357
And when you're in that place, within yourself,

704
00:28:37.357 --> 00:28:40.648
you go to areas within yourself that you never knew existed.

705
00:28:40.648 --> 00:28:42.281
And you contemplate all sorts of things.

706
00:28:42.281 --> 00:28:44.854
And I contemplated, while I was being tortured,

707
00:28:44.854 --> 00:28:46.582
Jesus Christ being tortured.

708
00:28:46.582 --> 00:28:48.922
It's a bit, it's in the program, I grew up in Christendom.

709
00:28:48.922 --> 00:28:50.200
<v Regina>We're all part of the program.</v>

710
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.727
I mean, we haven't escaped it, yeah.

711
00:28:51.727 --> 00:28:54.076
<v ->So, you just go there within yourself.</v>

712
00:28:54.076 --> 00:28:57.101
And I felt, deep in my heart in that moment,

713
00:28:57.101 --> 00:29:00.704
that what we're being told is false.

714
00:29:00.704 --> 00:29:02.023
And then, I have my journey

715
00:29:02.023 --> 00:29:03.431
up through the dimensions of the universe.

716
00:29:03.431 --> 00:29:06.030
So, in that moment, you're one with the Christ anyway.

717
00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.838
When you're in that greater aspect of being-ness.

718
00:29:08.838 --> 00:29:11.512
And the full knowings there, and I remember it.

719
00:29:11.512 --> 00:29:14.670
He did not resurrect after He died, He died a man.

720
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.272
Because what He did was, okay,

721
00:29:17.272 --> 00:29:18.876
I'll get back to that in a moment.

722
00:29:18.876 --> 00:29:23.843
So, when He was crucified, He stepped back from his wife

723
00:29:23.843 --> 00:29:26.823
and allowed others to maraud His beloved.

724
00:29:26.823 --> 00:29:29.188
Now, to me, that's a sacrifice.

725
00:29:29.188 --> 00:29:31.763
That's more than sacrifice.

726
00:29:31.763 --> 00:29:34.031
Especially because I'm a married man, I have my beloved.

727
00:29:34.031 --> 00:29:36.205
It doesn't matter what relationship anyone's in,

728
00:29:36.205 --> 00:29:37.767
you'll always have the masculine, the feminine,

729
00:29:37.767 --> 00:29:39.170
playing those roles.

730
00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:42.342
So, when a masculine steps back from the feminine

731
00:29:42.342 --> 00:29:45.209
and allows others to maraud the feminine,

732
00:29:45.209 --> 00:29:47.634
that's what we're talking about.

733
00:29:47.634 --> 00:29:51.313
And that is a sacrifice on incredible level.

734
00:29:51.313 --> 00:29:54.512
Then there's a sacrifice that's even greater than His.

735
00:29:54.512 --> 00:29:57.089
And that's the one of the divine feminine.

736
00:29:57.089 --> 00:29:58.518
That is Mother Earth, herself.

737
00:29:58.518 --> 00:30:01.397
To allow herself to be marauded by others,

738
00:30:01.397 --> 00:30:04.500
to facilitate these experiences we're having.

739
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:09.101
It's just, it defies one's ability to comprehend--

740
00:30:09.101 --> 00:30:11.060
<v Regina>To allow us to have these experiences--</v>

741
00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.870
<v ->To allow us to have, to facilitate, and allow us</v>

742
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:15.910
to have these experiences we're having.

743
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.146
<v Regina>And is that because there almost has to be</v>

744
00:30:18.146 --> 00:30:19.671
a certain amount of darkness and pain

745
00:30:19.671 --> 00:30:24.208
that will be enough to propel us back into remembrance?

746
00:30:24.208 --> 00:30:26.886
<v ->Yeah, because the deeper you go into it,</v>

747
00:30:26.886 --> 00:30:31.206
the greater the learning, and the greater the wisdom.

748
00:30:31.206 --> 00:30:32.918
And therefore, the greater the understanding--

749
00:30:32.918 --> 00:30:34.289
<v Regina>And you embody it, from having</v>

750
00:30:34.289 --> 00:30:35.689
gone through the experience.
<v ->You are it.</v>

751
00:30:35.689 --> 00:30:37.195
<v Regina>You generally embody that.</v>

752
00:30:37.195 --> 00:30:41.150
<v Both>You are it.</v>

753
00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:43.927
<v ->You never, you'll never not be it.</v>

754
00:30:43.927 --> 00:30:46.799
You are always it, you will always have it.

755
00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:48.705
Because you'll always be it.

756
00:30:48.705 --> 00:30:49.574
It is so profound--

757
00:30:49.574 --> 00:30:54.017
<v Regina>So this is part of those great cycles.</v>

758
00:30:54.017 --> 00:30:56.185
And we're simply living in that part,

759
00:30:56.185 --> 00:30:58.252
where it had to get the darkest before the dawn.

760
00:30:58.252 --> 00:30:59.957
And the dawn is here now.

761
00:30:59.957 --> 00:31:02.004
<v ->The dawn is, yeah.
<v Regina>The dawn is here.</v>

762
00:31:02.004 --> 00:31:05.294
And just, going back, this is something that's popping up--

763
00:31:05.294 --> 00:31:07.190
<v ->And there are some people just, sorry I cut you off.</v>

764
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:09.493
'Cause this dawn thing is, there are some people

765
00:31:09.493 --> 00:31:13.503
out there, that are saying this is new dawn or the new age.

766
00:31:13.503 --> 00:31:17.294
And we're using those labels.

767
00:31:17.294 --> 00:31:19.838
But there's a conspiratorial thing going on around it.

768
00:31:19.838 --> 00:31:22.236
And yes, the "ruling masters,"

769
00:31:22.236 --> 00:31:23.348
if you want to put it that way,

770
00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:25.906
I'll say "the powers that were,"

771
00:31:25.906 --> 00:31:28.686
are manipulating that for their purposes.

772
00:31:28.686 --> 00:31:30.818
We are not associated with that manipulation.

773
00:31:30.818 --> 00:31:33.249
We are actually exposing that manipulation.

774
00:31:33.249 --> 00:31:35.277
By talking about these false entities,

775
00:31:35.277 --> 00:31:37.473
and these false religious gods,

776
00:31:37.473 --> 00:31:39.959
and new age deities, and what have you.

777
00:31:39.959 --> 00:31:43.491
So, we're not associated with that, in that way.

778
00:31:43.491 --> 00:31:45.824
We're using those terminologies in the true sense

779
00:31:45.824 --> 00:31:49.661
of the words, not in the conspiratorial sense of the word.

780
00:31:49.661 --> 00:31:50.973
Because there are speakers out there

781
00:31:50.973 --> 00:31:53.409
that talk about the dawning of the new day,

782
00:31:53.409 --> 00:31:54.372
and things like that.

783
00:31:54.372 --> 00:31:57.596
Which is a big con for humanity.

784
00:31:57.596 --> 00:32:00.579
And we're not associated with that deception of humanity.

785
00:32:00.579 --> 00:32:02.282
<v Regina>We're talking about a genuine dawning</v>

786
00:32:02.282 --> 00:32:04.886
inside the human being, inside the heart.

787
00:32:04.886 --> 00:32:05.635
<v ->Correct.</v>

788
00:32:05.635 --> 00:32:06.927
<v Regina>So, I just want to make that clear too,</v>

789
00:32:06.927 --> 00:32:08.816
that's what I'm referring to, as well.

790
00:32:08.816 --> 00:32:11.590
And, if you go through, I just want to go back to,

791
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:13.726
we were talking about this entity

792
00:32:13.726 --> 00:32:17.392
that experience its life as Jesus,

793
00:32:17.392 --> 00:32:21.584
as Mary Magdalene, the feminine Earth form.

794
00:32:21.584 --> 00:32:25.130
This, another one of the areas

795
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:27.150
that is being focused on,

796
00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:30.075
is in saying that these entities

797
00:32:30.075 --> 00:32:33.150
are always associated with the same story.

798
00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:36.415
The same birth time, around the same equinoxes

799
00:32:36.415 --> 00:32:38.286
and solstices, and so forth.

800
00:32:38.286 --> 00:32:42.237
And, we're talking about the pairings from Egypt

801
00:32:42.237 --> 00:32:44.562
and back into Sumeria, the names we already know,

802
00:32:44.562 --> 00:32:48.526
into the times that became Christendom.

803
00:32:48.526 --> 00:32:52.363
Is it that those beings, are you saying potentially,

804
00:32:52.363 --> 00:32:54.903
that these beings actually were choosing to incarnate

805
00:32:54.903 --> 00:32:57.901
under these kinds of influences repeatedly

806
00:32:57.901 --> 00:33:00.399
to use the power within them?

807
00:33:00.399 --> 00:33:03.077
Or, is that a construct too?

808
00:33:03.077 --> 00:33:04.768
Because, there's like three or four questions

809
00:33:04.768 --> 00:33:06.474
embedded in that issue, you see what I'm saying.

810
00:33:06.474 --> 00:33:09.960
'Cause a lot of people say, no, there was no Christ,

811
00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:10.843
no, none of these others--

812
00:33:10.843 --> 00:33:11.508
<v ->Yeah, they say that--</v>

813
00:33:11.508 --> 00:33:13.282
<v Regina>Were fictional, mythological characters.</v>

814
00:33:13.282 --> 00:33:14.516
'Cause they all have the same story,

815
00:33:14.516 --> 00:33:16.014
so therefore, it didn't exist.

816
00:33:16.014 --> 00:33:18.978
It is just a myth that has been perpetuated.

817
00:33:18.978 --> 00:33:20.764
How do you see that?

818
00:33:20.764 --> 00:33:23.158
<v ->Well, I was back there around that time,</v>

819
00:33:23.158 --> 00:33:26.422
and I remember seeing the man being crucified.

820
00:33:26.422 --> 00:33:29.830
And they did shave his head completely.

821
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:32.039
'Cause it's humility.

822
00:33:32.039 --> 00:33:36.174
There's little bits and pieces that, and I am connected

823
00:33:36.174 --> 00:33:39.647
with the consciousness of the sun and the Earth,

824
00:33:39.647 --> 00:33:43.017
and I'm connected with my greater aspect of self.

825
00:33:43.017 --> 00:33:47.995
So, you get to reconnect with the knowledge,

826
00:33:47.995 --> 00:33:50.286
and reconnect with the way things transpire.

827
00:33:50.286 --> 00:33:51.954
I don't have full memory,

828
00:33:51.954 --> 00:33:54.696
but there are certain bits and pieces that I do remember,

829
00:33:54.696 --> 00:33:59.065
and I know that they are solid, for me. They are solid.

830
00:33:59.065 --> 00:34:01.974
And so, people wanna say

831
00:34:01.974 --> 00:34:04.924
that Jesus never walked this Earth,

832
00:34:04.924 --> 00:34:06.474
because they don't wanna accept the fact

833
00:34:06.474 --> 00:34:08.175
that the sun had an incarnation,

834
00:34:08.175 --> 00:34:10.544
at that time, as that man.

835
00:34:10.544 --> 00:34:13.951
So, for me, it's more of an agenda.

836
00:34:13.951 --> 00:34:17.442
It's propagating the deception of humanity

837
00:34:17.442 --> 00:34:19.343
to say that He wasn't here.

838
00:34:19.343 --> 00:34:22.045
<v Regina>Yeah, and I guess maybe I'm just nitpicking here.</v>

839
00:34:22.045 --> 00:34:27.023
Because I know very specific positions

840
00:34:27.023 --> 00:34:28.749
right now are that,

841
00:34:28.749 --> 00:34:31.001
because each of these, the lure

842
00:34:31.001 --> 00:34:32.599
around each of these characters,

843
00:34:32.599 --> 00:34:34.901
that you say are expressions of the sun,

844
00:34:34.901 --> 00:34:37.665
have the same backstory in terms of the virgin birth,

845
00:34:37.665 --> 00:34:41.464
and their birth into the world at a certain time,

846
00:34:41.464 --> 00:34:45.368
into Christmas-time, Easter, the death, and so forth.

847
00:34:45.368 --> 00:34:48.812
Is it possible that the sun did incarnate

848
00:34:48.812 --> 00:34:50.086
with those specific aspects,

849
00:34:50.086 --> 00:34:52.152
for specific reasons repeatedly,

850
00:34:52.152 --> 00:34:55.821
so that you would get a repeated story?

851
00:34:55.821 --> 00:34:57.574
<v ->Yeah, I would say that there are aspects</v>

852
00:34:57.574 --> 00:35:00.590
of the story that have been repeated,

853
00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:04.229
just because they entrenched it into the psyche of humanity

854
00:35:04.229 --> 00:35:07.692
so far along ago, that they wanna

855
00:35:07.692 --> 00:35:10.830
keep repeating that, because it's working.

856
00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:11.772
It's something that works--

857
00:35:11.772 --> 00:35:13.039
<v Regina>So, the repetitious is working</v>

858
00:35:13.039 --> 00:35:14.996
in the artificial construct.

859
00:35:14.996 --> 00:35:16.945
Just, it just popped through my mind.

860
00:35:16.945 --> 00:35:19.683
Let's get into the, what's happening with these entities

861
00:35:19.683 --> 00:35:21.981
that you're talking about, that are now being perpetuated

862
00:35:21.981 --> 00:35:24.707
as the new saviors or the new gods.

863
00:35:24.707 --> 00:35:26.684
New terminology, new names, might give a few

864
00:35:26.684 --> 00:35:30.356
of the names that some of these newly forming religions

865
00:35:30.356 --> 00:35:32.560
are talking about, and what that means.

866
00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.054
And how these fourth dimensional entities

867
00:35:35.054 --> 00:35:38.100
are literally interfacing as we're waking up.

868
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.498
And beginning to see beyond previously closed veils.

869
00:35:42.498 --> 00:35:44.433
In dream-time, in walking around time.

870
00:35:44.433 --> 00:35:46.140
We're very susceptible now.

871
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:50.311
And it's very confusing soup if you're starting to see.

872
00:35:50.311 --> 00:35:52.311
<v ->Yeah. Before I answer that, I wanna go back</v>

873
00:35:52.311 --> 00:35:55.369
to the Jesus theme, when He was actually crucified

874
00:35:55.369 --> 00:35:57.081
on the cross and He died a man?

875
00:35:57.081 --> 00:36:00.690
He actually entered the cycle, this is really,

876
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:03.180
this is hidden knowledge, and I really wanna share it.

877
00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.526
This is for people to really understand

878
00:36:04.526 --> 00:36:06.027
what's transpired here.

879
00:36:06.027 --> 00:36:09.187
He entered the cycle of reincarnation like us.

880
00:36:09.187 --> 00:36:14.019
So basically, He had multiple lives between the time he died

881
00:36:14.019 --> 00:36:16.939
on the cross and up until now.

882
00:36:16.939 --> 00:36:19.771
And so, he entered the cycle of reincarnation,

883
00:36:19.771 --> 00:36:22.148
just to be, because the way

884
00:36:22.148 --> 00:36:25.448
the universal Creator behaves,

885
00:36:25.448 --> 00:36:27.203
he doesn't sit there all, and she doesn't sit there

886
00:36:27.203 --> 00:36:29.214
all high and mighty, they don't do that.

887
00:36:29.214 --> 00:36:32.180
And, they get down in with the people

888
00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.869
in all levels of their creation.

889
00:36:34.869 --> 00:36:36.550
They're not above and beyond the process.

890
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:38.959
So, they're down here with us.

891
00:36:38.959 --> 00:36:42.162
If there's a slave, they're having a life as a slave.

892
00:36:42.162 --> 00:36:44.066
If there's a king, they're having a life as a king.

893
00:36:44.066 --> 00:36:46.160
And everything in-between, you know what I'm saying?

894
00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:50.105
So, basically that He needed to come in,

895
00:36:50.105 --> 00:36:53.099
as part of their divine plan, He needed to enter

896
00:36:53.099 --> 00:36:56.779
the domain of the matrix, the arena of the Anti-Christ.

897
00:36:56.779 --> 00:36:59.773
Okay? So to speak.

898
00:36:59.773 --> 00:37:02.938
Which has been overlaid on His wife's body.

899
00:37:02.938 --> 00:37:06.277
And He entered that reincarnational cycle.

900
00:37:06.277 --> 00:37:08.185
Because He was gonna go in and change it

901
00:37:08.185 --> 00:37:09.916
from the inside-out.

902
00:37:09.916 --> 00:37:12.253
And He's incarnate on the planet at the moment.

903
00:37:12.253 --> 00:37:14.529
And people will know, when the veil lifts,

904
00:37:14.529 --> 00:37:17.697
they will just know who that person is.

905
00:37:17.697 --> 00:37:20.091
I've got so many Jesus Christs

906
00:37:20.091 --> 00:37:21.086
that are getting in touch with me

907
00:37:21.086 --> 00:37:22.562
at the moment, it's ridiculous.

908
00:37:22.562 --> 00:37:25.405
Mary Magdalenes, Isises, you name it.

909
00:37:25.405 --> 00:37:28.033
Everyone's claiming it at the moment.

910
00:37:28.033 --> 00:37:29.569
But all I say to all these people is,

911
00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:32.588
if you feel that you are, I say just relax with it.

912
00:37:32.588 --> 00:37:35.046
Because if you really are that being,

913
00:37:35.046 --> 00:37:36.478
then everybody's gonna see you,

914
00:37:36.478 --> 00:37:38.684
as soon as the veil lifts, so just wait.

915
00:37:38.684 --> 00:37:40.378
That's all you gotta do.

916
00:37:40.378 --> 00:37:42.617
We'll know who you are when the time comes.

917
00:37:42.617 --> 00:37:43.572
So, that's what I wanna say.

918
00:37:43.572 --> 00:37:46.129
Because that thing is being perpetuated on this planet,

919
00:37:46.129 --> 00:37:48.110
it's quite an incredible thing at the moment.

920
00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:51.110
Our egos are going crazy with it.

921
00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:52.303
It's very important that everybody

922
00:37:52.303 --> 00:37:54.353
just settles down with that sort of thing.

923
00:37:54.353 --> 00:37:56.540
Now, it's also 'cause the Christ energy

924
00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.070
is awakening within the nature of us.

925
00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:01.376
So, as we're connecting with that consciousness,

926
00:38:01.376 --> 00:38:04.008
a lot of people are, their egos are kinda claiming it.

927
00:38:04.008 --> 00:38:05.543
So, that's going on as well.

928
00:38:05.543 --> 00:38:08.686
<v Regina>And on that whole subject</v>

929
00:38:08.686 --> 00:38:11.113
of illusion, so to speak, beyond the veil.

930
00:38:11.113 --> 00:38:12.348
You just said when the veils part.

931
00:38:12.348 --> 00:38:14.715
Right now the veils are thinning and we're starting to see,

932
00:38:14.715 --> 00:38:16.151
but some of the views are distorted,

933
00:38:16.151 --> 00:38:19.088
depending on how clearly you can see or cannot.

934
00:38:19.088 --> 00:38:20.785
And we're interfacing, as a species,

935
00:38:20.785 --> 00:38:22.862
with many things that have really been sealed off

936
00:38:22.862 --> 00:38:24.903
from us, our conscious awareness.

937
00:38:24.903 --> 00:38:27.936
Can you talk about our, this dimension of interface

938
00:38:27.936 --> 00:38:28.643
and what it's bringing.

939
00:38:28.643 --> 00:38:30.170
<v ->Yeah, I just wanna finish that other point, I'm sorry--</v>

940
00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:31.236
<v Regina>Oh sure, I thought you were done with it.</v>

941
00:38:31.236 --> 00:38:32.708
<v ->I'm not trying to avoid the questions,</v>

942
00:38:32.708 --> 00:38:34.276
I want you to ask the questions again,

943
00:38:34.276 --> 00:38:36.307
but I'm just trying to finish that point.

944
00:38:36.307 --> 00:38:39.279
And so, when you look back at when this man died,

945
00:38:39.279 --> 00:38:40.904
'cause I'm giving you incredible information here

946
00:38:40.904 --> 00:38:43.118
that doesn't get talked about, you know?

947
00:38:43.118 --> 00:38:46.785
So, when this man died, when He died a man,

948
00:38:46.785 --> 00:38:49.212
you know, 'cause if you look at the shock,

949
00:38:49.212 --> 00:38:52.722
it created a shock wave into the human psyche when he died.

950
00:38:52.722 --> 00:38:56.162
It was because God died a man.

951
00:38:56.162 --> 00:38:58.933
It was like people in that day, 'cause I'm telling you

952
00:38:58.933 --> 00:39:01.936
what it was like for all of us that were there at that time.

953
00:39:01.936 --> 00:39:04.591
When you have the Creator of the universe

954
00:39:04.591 --> 00:39:07.398
in its masculine expression walking this Earth,

955
00:39:07.398 --> 00:39:10.567
as, you know, from stepping down from the sun-consciousness.

956
00:39:10.567 --> 00:39:13.670
Walking this Earth, and to know that

957
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:15.447
that being was capable of anything.

958
00:39:15.447 --> 00:39:18.388
Why He allowed Himself to be killed?

959
00:39:18.388 --> 00:39:21.758
And just, and just die.

960
00:39:21.758 --> 00:39:25.189
That was the shock wave that went entrenched.

961
00:39:25.189 --> 00:39:28.122
That is the, it's trauma, it was trauma

962
00:39:28.122 --> 00:39:29.794
for all the people back then.

963
00:39:29.794 --> 00:39:33.923
And that's why it's been so effective throughout the ages.

964
00:39:33.923 --> 00:39:36.461
There's no way that people can,

965
00:39:36.461 --> 00:39:38.843
anyone who knows anything about the human psyche,

966
00:39:38.843 --> 00:39:40.673
who knows anything about human emotion,

967
00:39:40.673 --> 00:39:41.968
and the way we function as beings,

968
00:39:41.968 --> 00:39:44.947
will tell you that you cannot say that man

969
00:39:44.947 --> 00:39:46.951
is a myth and didn't walk this Earth.

970
00:39:46.951 --> 00:39:50.471
Because you cannot have so many people

971
00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:54.948
connecting with this energy so deeply for so long.

972
00:39:54.948 --> 00:39:59.548
It's impossible. You cannot propagate a lie to that degree.

973
00:39:59.548 --> 00:40:00.565
<v Regina>With that much feeling.</v>

974
00:40:00.565 --> 00:40:04.620
<v ->With that much. The depth, it cannot be.</v>

975
00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:08.098
There has to be a twisted manipulation of truth.

976
00:40:08.098 --> 00:40:10.563
They can twist the truth and manipulate the truth.

977
00:40:10.563 --> 00:40:12.799
But the truth has the seed of truth,

978
00:40:12.799 --> 00:40:14.932
has to be there to begin with.

979
00:40:14.932 --> 00:40:16.911
And that's what I want to say here.

980
00:40:16.911 --> 00:40:18.739
The people who say that He never walked,

981
00:40:18.739 --> 00:40:21.109
that it's just a myth, they don't get it.

982
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:23.219
They don't understand humanity.

983
00:40:23.219 --> 00:40:25.554
They don't understand themselves.

984
00:40:25.554 --> 00:40:28.383
And that's what I wanna say there.

985
00:40:28.383 --> 00:40:32.091
Because, that was when, Him coming here and dying as a man,

986
00:40:32.091 --> 00:40:33.890
and that was such a traumatic experience

987
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:37.950
to the people that were on the planet back then.

988
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:40.167
It was just a shock, it was trauma.

989
00:40:40.167 --> 00:40:42.537
<v Regina>And it seems to continue through to this day.</v>

990
00:40:42.537 --> 00:40:44.161
<v ->Yeah, and see I'm feeling it now.</v>

991
00:40:44.161 --> 00:40:45.367
I'm feeling my life back then,

992
00:40:45.367 --> 00:40:47.386
I'm feeling what we felt back then.

993
00:40:47.386 --> 00:40:49.379
That's why I'm so passionate when I'm speaking about it,

994
00:40:49.379 --> 00:40:52.366
'cause I'm bringing back those energies again,

995
00:40:52.366 --> 00:40:53.275
do you know what I mean?

996
00:40:53.275 --> 00:40:54.772
And I'm feeling that trauma

997
00:40:54.772 --> 00:40:56.674
that everyone suffered back then.

998
00:40:56.674 --> 00:40:59.786
It was really, it had such, people suffered a lot

999
00:40:59.786 --> 00:41:02.252
after that, it was a shock, you know.

1000
00:41:02.252 --> 00:41:05.051
<v Regina>Well, we interviewed a man named Bob Dean.</v>

1001
00:41:05.051 --> 00:41:08.232
Who we have up on the site right now,

1002
00:41:08.232 --> 00:41:09.618
our last interview with him.

1003
00:41:09.618 --> 00:41:11.888
And he spent a great deal of time talking about this,

1004
00:41:11.888 --> 00:41:14.135
as someone who was there witnessing this in the day,

1005
00:41:14.135 --> 00:41:16.296
and had the same amount of emotion coming through.

1006
00:41:16.296 --> 00:41:21.004
And just really wanted us to understand the feelings

1007
00:41:21.004 --> 00:41:23.955
of what happened around this being at the time.

1008
00:41:23.955 --> 00:41:27.244
And it would make sense that people incarnated at that time

1009
00:41:27.244 --> 00:41:29.083
would be here gathering now, of course.

1010
00:41:29.083 --> 00:41:31.919
<v ->Everybody who was, had anything to do</v>

1011
00:41:31.919 --> 00:41:34.549
with any significant time, of period at the time,

1012
00:41:34.549 --> 00:41:36.124
throughout those histories is here now.

1013
00:41:36.124 --> 00:41:39.357
<v Regina>Is here now, exactly.</v>

1014
00:41:39.357 --> 00:41:40.615
We're gonna do an edit here.

1015
00:41:40.615 --> 00:41:42.461
I've already asked you that other question twice.

1016
00:41:42.461 --> 00:41:45.126
We're gonna stream through in sequence the things you said.

1017
00:41:45.126 --> 00:41:47.259
So, it won't be interrupted with my question.

1018
00:41:47.259 --> 00:41:49.202
And now, my question pops up.

1019
00:41:49.202 --> 00:41:50.802
Okay, so we're beyond the veil.

1020
00:41:50.802 --> 00:41:53.374
And now, we're looking through a veil with distortion.

1021
00:41:53.374 --> 00:41:58.241
<v ->Yeah. Okay, yeah, so we have this point in time</v>

1022
00:41:58.241 --> 00:41:59.669
in our journey where the veil's getting thinner

1023
00:41:59.669 --> 00:42:01.671
and thinner and thinner and thinner.

1024
00:42:01.671 --> 00:42:03.450
So, we're getting glimpses, you know?

1025
00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:06.651
We're getting tastes and moments of experiences

1026
00:42:06.651 --> 00:42:09.755
of that greater aspect of self, and that greater energy,

1027
00:42:09.755 --> 00:42:11.528
in what we call our Christ-consciousness.

1028
00:42:11.528 --> 00:42:14.978
Such as, it's like the lotus flower is beginning to open up.

1029
00:42:14.978 --> 00:42:19.796
It's that seed that's beginning to sprout.

1030
00:42:19.796 --> 00:42:22.202
That's why sometimes we kinda think we got it

1031
00:42:22.202 --> 00:42:26.402
and we kinda haven't got it, there's a lot of that going on.

1032
00:42:26.402 --> 00:42:27.370
What I want to say to people,

1033
00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:28.459
it's getting thinner and thinner.

1034
00:42:28.459 --> 00:42:30.409
It's going to get to the point where,

1035
00:42:30.409 --> 00:42:33.375
one day the veil's just gonna disappear altogether.

1036
00:42:33.375 --> 00:42:35.248
And when that happens, oh wow,

1037
00:42:35.248 --> 00:42:37.717
this place is gonna transform so dramatically.

1038
00:42:37.717 --> 00:42:40.180
<v Regina>But, in the interim, you have various beings</v>

1039
00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.321
who are actually trying to get our attention.

1040
00:42:42.321 --> 00:42:44.891
Some genuinely trying to help, with varying degrees

1041
00:42:44.891 --> 00:42:46.686
of actual understanding and knowledge.

1042
00:42:46.686 --> 00:42:47.763
Some high, some low.

1043
00:42:47.763 --> 00:42:51.099
You also have beings who are manipulating, still.

1044
00:42:51.099 --> 00:42:53.582
Trying to convince us that they might have

1045
00:42:53.582 --> 00:42:57.063
a higher status, somehow, in the universe (laughs) and that.

1046
00:42:57.063 --> 00:43:00.638
So we have to, people are interfacing with beings.

1047
00:43:00.638 --> 00:43:04.467
<v ->Yeah, okay, I get where you're coming from now.</v>

1048
00:43:04.467 --> 00:43:09.467
So, as our consciousness is awakening, what they wanna do

1049
00:43:09.473 --> 00:43:12.819
is, 'cause we're leaving, say, the religious paradigm.

1050
00:43:12.819 --> 00:43:14.113
So what they need to do is they need

1051
00:43:14.113 --> 00:43:16.521
to create another paradigm.

1052
00:43:16.521 --> 00:43:19.742
So, the ones who have left the religious dogma

1053
00:43:19.742 --> 00:43:22.651
can now be entrapped in another paradigm.

1054
00:43:22.651 --> 00:43:25.062
An example of that would be a being

1055
00:43:25.062 --> 00:43:27.894
that people know as Lord Sanada in the new age movement.

1056
00:43:27.894 --> 00:43:29.702
Who turned up in my bedroom.

1057
00:43:29.702 --> 00:43:31.901
And showered me with all this love and all this light,

1058
00:43:31.901 --> 00:43:33.838
looking like Jesus Christ.

1059
00:43:33.838 --> 00:43:36.041
And I just said to him, "Get out."

1060
00:43:36.041 --> 00:43:39.045
You know? "Leave, go. You're an imposter

1061
00:43:39.045 --> 00:43:42.643
and you have no power over me, now go."

1062
00:43:42.643 --> 00:43:46.859
And he went. And that for me was just, wow.

1063
00:43:46.859 --> 00:43:48.256
It was an incredible experience.

1064
00:43:48.256 --> 00:43:50.781
'Cause, on one level I wasn't expecting it,

1065
00:43:50.781 --> 00:43:53.857
it surprised the crap out of me, really.

1066
00:43:53.857 --> 00:43:56.365
On another level, I was really pleased with myself

1067
00:43:56.365 --> 00:44:01.345
that I didn't react but responded in that way.

1068
00:44:01.345 --> 00:44:03.996
And a lot of other people wouldn't have done that.

1069
00:44:03.996 --> 00:44:05.202
They would have fallen to their knees,

1070
00:44:05.202 --> 00:44:06.696
they would have cried, and that being

1071
00:44:06.696 --> 00:44:10.367
would've just got its tentacles into them even further.

1072
00:44:10.367 --> 00:44:12.741
So, they're taking advantage.

1073
00:44:12.741 --> 00:44:15.017
What they want to do is, as our consciousness is rising,

1074
00:44:15.017 --> 00:44:16.944
they wanna grab it and they wanna steer it

1075
00:44:16.944 --> 00:44:18.388
into their direction.

1076
00:44:18.388 --> 00:44:21.240
So they're coming up with, instead of the Jesus Christ

1077
00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.954
of the church, now they have the Lord Sanada

1078
00:44:23.954 --> 00:44:24.956
of the new age movement.

1079
00:44:24.956 --> 00:44:27.227
So they have the cosmic version of the Christ.

1080
00:44:27.227 --> 00:44:30.433
You know, to fit the paradigms of people's minds

1081
00:44:30.433 --> 00:44:32.166
and awarenesses on that level, you know,

1082
00:44:32.166 --> 00:44:36.183
little ascended masters, which is the new age angels

1083
00:44:36.183 --> 00:44:39.461
basically, in a sense.

1084
00:44:39.461 --> 00:44:42.931
<v Regina>So, the words would be discernment.</v>

1085
00:44:42.931 --> 00:44:44.102
<v ->Discernment.</v>

1086
00:44:44.102 --> 00:44:45.789
<v Regina>And how would you characterize</v>

1087
00:44:45.789 --> 00:44:49.552
the best way to properly discern

1088
00:44:49.552 --> 00:44:52.045
what's going on when somebody comes up

1089
00:44:52.045 --> 00:44:55.693
against these various manifestions

1090
00:44:55.693 --> 00:44:58.474
when they're looking into another reality?

1091
00:44:58.474 --> 00:45:01.107
<v ->Well, first of all,</v>

1092
00:45:01.107 --> 00:45:03.747
if people are expecting the Christ

1093
00:45:03.747 --> 00:45:06.866
to look like what Jesus looked like,

1094
00:45:06.866 --> 00:45:10.565
first of all, that's the biggest mistake they're gonna make.

1095
00:45:10.565 --> 00:45:12.244
Because, like I said, that consciousness has

1096
00:45:12.244 --> 00:45:13.997
come to this planet many times over.

1097
00:45:13.997 --> 00:45:17.805
And what that consciousness will look like in this lifetime,

1098
00:45:17.805 --> 00:45:20.213
I don't know, we're just not gonna know.

1099
00:45:20.213 --> 00:45:23.215
We gotta wait until it gets revealed to everybody.

1100
00:45:23.215 --> 00:45:25.114
Then everybody will know.

1101
00:45:25.114 --> 00:45:27.925
So, that's the number one mistake everybody's making.

1102
00:45:27.925 --> 00:45:30.719
'Cause that's an image that has been imprinted

1103
00:45:30.719 --> 00:45:32.347
into the psyche of the people.

1104
00:45:32.347 --> 00:45:34.461
<v Regina>And we know he has blond hair and blue eyes.</v>

1105
00:45:34.461 --> 00:45:36.497
That's what he looked like in the Lutheran church.

1106
00:45:36.497 --> 00:45:37.779
<v ->Apparently.
<v Regina>Wavy blond hair</v>

1107
00:45:37.779 --> 00:45:39.897
and nice blue eyes. (laughs)

1108
00:45:39.897 --> 00:45:42.788
<v ->Apparently. Yeah, yeah.</v>

1109
00:45:42.788 --> 00:45:45.297
Even though he grew up as a Jew and he had olive skin.

1110
00:45:45.297 --> 00:45:46.908
He had olive skin, a real pointy nose,

1111
00:45:46.908 --> 00:45:49.173
and his skin was like leather, actually.

1112
00:45:49.173 --> 00:45:51.335
<v Regina>Yeah, well not the one that hung in our church.</v>

1113
00:45:51.335 --> 00:45:54.315
<v ->Not the one that hung in your church, okay.</v>

1114
00:45:54.315 --> 00:45:55.936
<v Regina>Anyway, so, we get that.</v>

1115
00:45:55.936 --> 00:45:59.284
Don't be looking for something specific on that level.

1116
00:45:59.284 --> 00:46:01.061
<v ->You will know by the energy.</v>

1117
00:46:01.061 --> 00:46:04.191
And the real Christ doesn't behave in that way.

1118
00:46:04.191 --> 00:46:05.624
It doesn't want adoration, you know,

1119
00:46:05.624 --> 00:46:08.562
you walk through the shopping centers around Christmas-time,

1120
00:46:08.562 --> 00:46:11.980
and that song, "O Come Let Us Adore Him."

1121
00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:14.792
And things like that, it's disgusting, you just go...

1122
00:46:14.792 --> 00:46:18.331
Pardon the expression, but that's not Him.

1123
00:46:18.331 --> 00:46:20.511
It just comes down to respect and understanding.

1124
00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:25.046
That's all these beings require.

1125
00:46:25.046 --> 00:46:26.447
<v Regina>And what about Mary Magdalene, the feminine?</v>

1126
00:46:26.447 --> 00:46:27.741
<v ->The same, same.</v>

1127
00:46:27.741 --> 00:46:29.372
<v Regina>The feminine version of this.</v>

1128
00:46:29.372 --> 00:46:31.584
A lot of women, I mean, I've been to conferences

1129
00:46:31.584 --> 00:46:33.953
where people have written books claiming

1130
00:46:33.953 --> 00:46:35.152
they're Mary Magdalene.

1131
00:46:35.152 --> 00:46:36.688
<v ->Yeah. They do.</v>

1132
00:46:36.688 --> 00:46:38.252
<v Regina>And they mean it. I mean, they're feeling--</v>

1133
00:46:38.252 --> 00:46:39.346
<v ->They truly believe it.
<v Regina>They're connecting</v>

1134
00:46:39.346 --> 00:46:43.263
with that energy that, the divine feminine energy,

1135
00:46:43.263 --> 00:46:46.424
which is just now starting to resurrect itself.

1136
00:46:46.424 --> 00:46:50.439
So you can understand how this occurs.

1137
00:46:50.439 --> 00:46:53.035
<v ->I can understand how this occurs.</v>

1138
00:46:53.035 --> 00:46:57.938
And it's happening to so many people around the world.

1139
00:46:57.938 --> 00:46:59.780
We've been discussing the Christ a lot,

1140
00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.176
and I do wanna discuss the feminine

1141
00:47:01.176 --> 00:47:03.450
because we're on her body.

1142
00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:06.882
And this is the forgotten hero in all of this.

1143
00:47:06.882 --> 00:47:08.556
She's a forgotten hero.

1144
00:47:08.556 --> 00:47:10.673
The role that she's played is more significant

1145
00:47:10.673 --> 00:47:12.258
than the role of the male Christ.

1146
00:47:12.258 --> 00:47:16.323
The role that she's played is directly impacting us more.

1147
00:47:16.323 --> 00:47:18.399
Because we're breathing her atmosphere,

1148
00:47:18.399 --> 00:47:20.693
we're drinking her waters, we're eating her food,

1149
00:47:20.693 --> 00:47:22.368
we're on her body.

1150
00:47:22.368 --> 00:47:27.135
So, it's a more direct relationship.

1151
00:47:27.135 --> 00:47:31.773
We're like this with her, yet we've forgotten.

1152
00:47:31.773 --> 00:47:34.478
And it's been really clever, this 6000 year program,

1153
00:47:34.478 --> 00:47:37.119
which has managed to create this wall,

1154
00:47:37.119 --> 00:47:40.942
this partition within our minds to totally separate us

1155
00:47:40.942 --> 00:47:43.015
from the conscious awareness of this planet

1156
00:47:43.015 --> 00:47:44.451
that we walk upon.

1157
00:47:44.451 --> 00:47:47.429
It's ridiculous. It's so good, it's genius.

1158
00:47:47.429 --> 00:47:48.585
<v Regina>It is genius and it's working</v>

1159
00:47:48.585 --> 00:47:49.787
very well right now.

1160
00:47:49.787 --> 00:47:51.527
<v ->Oh. People just need to snap out--</v>

1161
00:47:51.527 --> 00:47:53.766
<v Regina>I mean badly, but I'm saying the program</v>

1162
00:47:53.766 --> 00:47:56.838
is running efficiently and to our detriment.

1163
00:47:56.838 --> 00:47:59.834
<v ->To our detriment on one level,</v>

1164
00:47:59.834 --> 00:48:02.604
to our benefit on a much grander level.

1165
00:48:02.604 --> 00:48:05.738
Because we got tested real good.

1166
00:48:05.738 --> 00:48:08.439
<v Regina>So now we need to use our discernment.</v>

1167
00:48:08.439 --> 00:48:11.086
When we're meditating and when we start hearing things.

1168
00:48:11.086 --> 00:48:13.646
And seeing things, it can be, really, anything.

1169
00:48:13.646 --> 00:48:15.954
And, again, I'm going to go back to the same question,

1170
00:48:15.954 --> 00:48:17.953
what is the discerning factor?

1171
00:48:17.953 --> 00:48:20.923
If you're meditating and some thing,

1172
00:48:20.923 --> 00:48:25.830
some being appears and tells you something,

1173
00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:28.467
what do you consider the discerning factor

1174
00:48:28.467 --> 00:48:30.236
in whether or not this something

1175
00:48:30.236 --> 00:48:33.444
you should be interfacing with for your own highest good?

1176
00:48:33.444 --> 00:48:35.774
<v ->Yeah, well the fact that a being turns up,</v>

1177
00:48:35.774 --> 00:48:37.971
straight away, is a red flag for me.

1178
00:48:37.971 --> 00:48:42.850
It's like a warning, why would they just turn up?

1179
00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:44.886
If people are asking for help,

1180
00:48:44.886 --> 00:48:47.619
then obviously they're asking for help,

1181
00:48:47.619 --> 00:48:50.989
but what they're asking for and who turns up

1182
00:48:50.989 --> 00:48:52.707
are probably going to be two different things.

1183
00:48:52.707 --> 00:48:55.208
And the fact that they're asking for help

1184
00:48:55.208 --> 00:48:57.859
means that they're still in the victim role.

1185
00:48:57.859 --> 00:48:59.326
That they don't think they have the capacity

1186
00:48:59.326 --> 00:49:01.463
to do it for themselves.

1187
00:49:01.463 --> 00:49:04.236
And people need to understand, excuse me,

1188
00:49:04.236 --> 00:49:07.005
understand just how powerful we are.

1189
00:49:07.005 --> 00:49:09.309
Bring their own light out, not to meditate

1190
00:49:09.309 --> 00:49:12.204
and bring someone else's light in to do it for you.

1191
00:49:12.204 --> 00:49:15.375
That's externalizing, that's giving your power over

1192
00:49:15.375 --> 00:49:16.806
to something outside of you.

1193
00:49:16.806 --> 00:49:19.449
And so, people are asking these other entities

1194
00:49:19.449 --> 00:49:21.757
to come along and do it for them,

1195
00:49:21.757 --> 00:49:24.855
and they're giving their power away and playing the victim.

1196
00:49:24.855 --> 00:49:27.747
And they don't realize we have all the light within us.

1197
00:49:27.747 --> 00:49:31.667
We have, everything that we require to protect ourselves,

1198
00:49:31.667 --> 00:49:34.002
to heal ourselves, is within.

1199
00:49:34.002 --> 00:49:35.422
And all the beings of the true light

1200
00:49:35.422 --> 00:49:37.700
come along and they encourage you to do that.

1201
00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:42.555
They don't want you to become dependent upon them.

1202
00:49:42.555 --> 00:49:45.145
It goes against the grain of who and what we are,

1203
00:49:45.145 --> 00:49:48.222
and why we're here, and what this whole reality's about.

1204
00:49:48.222 --> 00:49:51.653
Whenever you have beings that, for example,

1205
00:49:51.653 --> 00:49:54.253
this entity that's known as Saint Jermaine,

1206
00:49:54.253 --> 00:49:56.709
And you bring in the violet flame.

1207
00:49:56.709 --> 00:50:01.059
And I've had interactions with people that do that.

1208
00:50:01.059 --> 00:50:03.420
When I started talking to them that entity came through,

1209
00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:06.895
and it was really quite, quite confrontational.

1210
00:50:06.895 --> 00:50:09.401
Because I'm exposing what these beings are doing.

1211
00:50:09.401 --> 00:50:10.436
And they sell love.

1212
00:50:10.436 --> 00:50:12.397
It's all about love, it's all about light.

1213
00:50:12.397 --> 00:50:14.568
And because we've been deprived of love.

1214
00:50:14.568 --> 00:50:16.107
You know, the plan, this plan

1215
00:50:16.107 --> 00:50:18.041
that they've implemented is really clever.

1216
00:50:18.041 --> 00:50:20.950
Let's just plunge it, let's send the real dark,

1217
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:24.046
dastardly heavy weights, and let's just plunge humanity

1218
00:50:24.046 --> 00:50:26.516
into such a deep, negative charge,

1219
00:50:26.516 --> 00:50:29.852
that their existence there becomes so undesirable,

1220
00:50:29.852 --> 00:50:32.026
and they actually even build up a resentment

1221
00:50:32.026 --> 00:50:34.796
towards their very own existence there.

1222
00:50:34.796 --> 00:50:37.419
That, then, we can come along right at the end

1223
00:50:37.419 --> 00:50:39.961
and provide the solution to their problem.

1224
00:50:39.961 --> 00:50:42.666
That we created in the first place, but don't tell 'em that.

1225
00:50:42.666 --> 00:50:44.170
"Problem, reaction, solution,"

1226
00:50:44.170 --> 00:50:47.188
as the great man David Icke said before.

1227
00:50:47.188 --> 00:50:48.906
And it's not just on a planetary level,

1228
00:50:48.906 --> 00:50:51.978
this is cosmic, this plane.

1229
00:50:51.978 --> 00:50:54.875
"Problem, reaction, solution."

1230
00:50:54.875 --> 00:50:57.919
<v Regina>So, now let's look at the process</v>

1231
00:50:57.919 --> 00:51:00.321
we're all going through of recovering

1232
00:51:00.321 --> 00:51:02.177
our understanding of self.

1233
00:51:02.177 --> 00:51:03.762
Recovering who, our understanding

1234
00:51:03.762 --> 00:51:08.195
of what we truly are, within the universes and beyond.

1235
00:51:08.195 --> 00:51:10.343
And, it's really critical because

1236
00:51:10.343 --> 00:51:12.899
there is time involved here.

1237
00:51:12.899 --> 00:51:17.262
We're going into this period of true transformation.

1238
00:51:17.262 --> 00:51:20.773
So, let's talk about how you see that flowing.

1239
00:51:20.773 --> 00:51:23.435
And also, how you would help somebody else

1240
00:51:23.435 --> 00:51:26.881
understand what they need to focus on within themselves,

1241
00:51:26.881 --> 00:51:28.451
to go where you need to go.

1242
00:51:28.451 --> 00:51:31.208
<v ->Yeah. So, for the powers of discernment,</v>

1243
00:51:31.208 --> 00:51:35.014
it's gonna flow into this question from the last one.

1244
00:51:35.014 --> 00:51:39.816
Deep down inside of us we have a feeling of love

1245
00:51:39.816 --> 00:51:41.422
and understanding of what love is.

1246
00:51:41.422 --> 00:51:43.734
I mean, deep down inside.

1247
00:51:43.734 --> 00:51:47.116
I'm not talking about the love you experience

1248
00:51:47.116 --> 00:51:49.495
in the heart center of seven chakra body.

1249
00:51:49.495 --> 00:51:51.648
That's not the love I'm referring to.

1250
00:51:51.648 --> 00:51:54.636
That's positive, white love and light.

1251
00:51:54.636 --> 00:51:57.833
That's, you got negative and you got a positive.

1252
00:51:57.833 --> 00:51:59.409
Either side of the scales.

1253
00:51:59.409 --> 00:52:01.951
This positive, white love and light sees itself

1254
00:52:01.951 --> 00:52:05.687
as though it's above, and better, and beyond

1255
00:52:05.687 --> 00:52:07.918
the negative and the dark, and it's not.

1256
00:52:07.918 --> 00:52:10.017
It's across from it.

1257
00:52:10.017 --> 00:52:12.824
It's, they're alter-egos of one another.

1258
00:52:12.824 --> 00:52:14.126
Now, some people wanna venture

1259
00:52:14.126 --> 00:52:16.666
into the white love and light, good for them.

1260
00:52:16.666 --> 00:52:19.192
I've been there and I've done that, do you know what I mean?

1261
00:52:19.192 --> 00:52:21.301
It's very limiting, that way of life.

1262
00:52:21.301 --> 00:52:23.769
It's passive, and it's very controlling,

1263
00:52:23.769 --> 00:52:25.059
and it's very limiting.

1264
00:52:25.059 --> 00:52:27.812
But if you haven't experienced that kind of love before,

1265
00:52:27.812 --> 00:52:31.205
you've only experienced negativity for such a long time,

1266
00:52:31.205 --> 00:52:33.002
the moment that white love and light,

1267
00:52:33.002 --> 00:52:35.079
positive, white love and light comes along,

1268
00:52:35.079 --> 00:52:36.978
you're gonna think it's everything.

1269
00:52:36.978 --> 00:52:38.851
It's gonna be like a child that lives

1270
00:52:38.851 --> 00:52:41.009
in a candy store, for the first time.

1271
00:52:41.009 --> 00:52:41.824
You know what I'm saying?

1272
00:52:41.824 --> 00:52:44.547
So, a lot of people are falling for that trap.

1273
00:52:44.547 --> 00:52:47.651
And that is the energy that all these other entities

1274
00:52:47.651 --> 00:52:49.760
are manipulating humanity through.

1275
00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:52.693
They are using love against us.

1276
00:52:52.693 --> 00:52:54.067
It's very important to know that.

1277
00:52:54.067 --> 00:52:57.001
And when you go deeper inside, you go beyond that,

1278
00:52:57.001 --> 00:52:58.466
and you get to that state where you take

1279
00:52:58.466 --> 00:53:00.933
those two expressions and you blend them into one,

1280
00:53:00.933 --> 00:53:03.209
that version of love and light,

1281
00:53:03.209 --> 00:53:06.528
beyond that paradigm of negative and positive,

1282
00:53:06.528 --> 00:53:09.947
beyond that arena into this state of integrated oneness.

1283
00:53:09.947 --> 00:53:13.647
That love, there, is the one I'm talking about.

1284
00:53:13.647 --> 00:53:15.922
And we've got it deep, deep, deep inside of us.

1285
00:53:15.922 --> 00:53:19.016
That love, there, is the Christ center within us.

1286
00:53:19.016 --> 00:53:21.120
And when you can feel that love,

1287
00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:23.332
use that love as a point of reference.

1288
00:53:23.332 --> 00:53:25.487
So whenever an entity comes along,

1289
00:53:25.487 --> 00:53:28.368
if their vibration, their flavor of energy,

1290
00:53:28.368 --> 00:53:29.493
doesn't match what you've got

1291
00:53:29.493 --> 00:53:32.572
deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep down inside of you,

1292
00:53:32.572 --> 00:53:35.568
then, "See you later."

1293
00:53:35.568 --> 00:53:38.432
That's my recommendation. That's what I do

1294
00:53:38.432 --> 00:53:41.007
and it works for me, and I know it works for many people.

1295
00:53:41.007 --> 00:53:43.316
'Cause I get the feedback all over the world from it.

1296
00:53:43.316 --> 00:53:45.447
<v Regina>So, let's talk about how a person that feels</v>

1297
00:53:45.447 --> 00:53:49.082
they're very disconnected from that deep, deep love

1298
00:53:49.082 --> 00:53:51.751
inside them, starts reestablishing that

1299
00:53:51.751 --> 00:53:53.018
and bringing that out in themselves.

1300
00:53:53.018 --> 00:53:55.397
<v ->Yeah. And it's a simple process.</v>

1301
00:53:55.397 --> 00:53:56.818
You can just, if you can visualize

1302
00:53:56.818 --> 00:53:58.457
just your inner-light coming out.

1303
00:53:58.457 --> 00:54:01.702
And you bring it out with intention,

1304
00:54:01.702 --> 00:54:05.033
from your "I Am" presence, from your eternal self,

1305
00:54:05.033 --> 00:54:08.171
from your, you know, from the higher self.

1306
00:54:08.171 --> 00:54:11.240
And bring it out from the core of your being,

1307
00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:12.582
from your soul, from your "I Am,"

1308
00:54:12.582 --> 00:54:15.000
whatever labels you wanna use.

1309
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.247
If you have a block like I did in the beginning,

1310
00:54:17.247 --> 00:54:20.318
I visualized myself pulling the light out.

1311
00:54:20.318 --> 00:54:22.254
Which is what I was doing, to override.

1312
00:54:22.254 --> 00:54:24.247
So you use a mechanical process,

1313
00:54:24.247 --> 00:54:26.881
it overrides the mental block, the program.

1314
00:54:26.881 --> 00:54:29.261
And then after a while, you've overridden the program

1315
00:54:29.261 --> 00:54:31.131
and you just do it automatically.

1316
00:54:31.131 --> 00:54:33.555
Another technique I'll use is a breathing technique.

1317
00:54:33.555 --> 00:54:35.596
And you just, (inhales deeply)

1318
00:54:35.596 --> 00:54:37.340
so you don't have to do your hands like that,

1319
00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:40.270
but that was my light coming out.

1320
00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:43.368
With an in-breath, the light comes out.

1321
00:54:43.368 --> 00:54:46.378
With an out-breath you can just fill your body with it.

1322
00:54:46.378 --> 00:54:49.111
Or if you, if someone has a bit of a sore back,

1323
00:54:49.111 --> 00:54:52.245
you can put their hand there, and you bring your light out,

1324
00:54:52.245 --> 00:54:55.254
and just put the light through your hand.

1325
00:54:55.254 --> 00:54:56.735
And use that to heal.

1326
00:54:56.735 --> 00:54:58.816
'Cause this comes down to worthiness issues.

1327
00:54:58.816 --> 00:55:00.556
Is your light worthy?

1328
00:55:00.556 --> 00:55:02.958
You know, we're sinners, we're no good,

1329
00:55:02.958 --> 00:55:05.835
we're lowly humans, we're, you know.

1330
00:55:05.835 --> 00:55:07.029
We're this, we're that.

1331
00:55:07.029 --> 00:55:09.368
And that's what we get programmed with

1332
00:55:09.368 --> 00:55:10.930
throughout our lives and throughout history,

1333
00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:14.603
of our DNA's been marinating in this dogma for so long.

1334
00:55:14.603 --> 00:55:15.685
<v Regina>If someone looks and says,</v>

1335
00:55:15.685 --> 00:55:17.136
"Well, yeah, I really wasn't very nice

1336
00:55:17.136 --> 00:55:18.707
"to my brother or my sister,

1337
00:55:18.707 --> 00:55:21.022
"I don't really, I don't have that love

1338
00:55:21.022 --> 00:55:23.278
"as the essence of my being."

1339
00:55:23.278 --> 00:55:26.268
And we start, basically flogging ourselves,

1340
00:55:26.268 --> 00:55:28.873
feeling guilty over every little, common

1341
00:55:28.873 --> 00:55:30.949
mental and emotional reaction

1342
00:55:30.949 --> 00:55:32.659
to this life that we're living.

1343
00:55:32.659 --> 00:55:33.113
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1344
00:55:33.113 --> 00:55:34.225
<v Regina>Not good.</v>

1345
00:55:34.225 --> 00:55:35.816
<v ->No, it isn't, it isn't.</v>

1346
00:55:35.816 --> 00:55:38.700
It's not serving us anymore to be like that.

1347
00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:43.350
What people need to do is, now know that they're valued,

1348
00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:45.374
know that they are worthy, know that they are

1349
00:55:45.374 --> 00:55:47.730
of substance, and know that they are honored

1350
00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:49.471
and revered in this universe.

1351
00:55:49.471 --> 00:55:51.416
And they're held in such high regard.

1352
00:55:51.416 --> 00:55:53.336
It's actually the opposite.

1353
00:55:53.336 --> 00:55:55.644
And this isn't coming from ego, you know?

1354
00:55:55.644 --> 00:55:58.887
This is who and what we are, we showed the way.

1355
00:55:58.887 --> 00:56:00.541
We're the ones that had the courage.

1356
00:56:00.541 --> 00:56:02.879
Those entities, the self-righteous ones,

1357
00:56:02.879 --> 00:56:05.146
they didn't have the courage to come and incarnate.

1358
00:56:05.146 --> 00:56:06.116
They didn't have the courage

1359
00:56:06.116 --> 00:56:08.639
to strip themselves of everything, you know?

1360
00:56:08.639 --> 00:56:11.925
Of all the divinity and be totally vulnerable.

1361
00:56:11.925 --> 00:56:13.230
They don't have that courage,

1362
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:14.903
we're the ones with the courage.

1363
00:56:14.903 --> 00:56:17.432
And they are arrogant enough to come here

1364
00:56:17.432 --> 00:56:20.472
and play the self-righteous ones on top of that.

1365
00:56:20.472 --> 00:56:22.434
Just imagine where they're coming from,

1366
00:56:22.434 --> 00:56:23.647
when you really look at them.

1367
00:56:23.647 --> 00:56:26.414
<v Regina>Yeah. Very good point.</v>

1368
00:56:26.414 --> 00:56:30.265
And now, the way that it was shown to you once,

1369
00:56:30.265 --> 00:56:34.285
and it's been shown through various remote viewers and such,

1370
00:56:34.285 --> 00:56:35.653
people kept going to timelines,

1371
00:56:35.653 --> 00:56:38.777
we talk about 2012, December 21, 2012.

1372
00:56:38.777 --> 00:56:40.323
And I want to end on this

1373
00:56:40.323 --> 00:56:41.930
because we have only a few minutes left.

1374
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:45.996
But also, to end through the brilliance and beauty of it.

1375
00:56:45.996 --> 00:56:49.201
The way it was shown to you, and others have seen it,

1376
00:56:49.201 --> 00:56:52.837
is they couldn't get past March 21, 2013.

1377
00:56:52.837 --> 00:56:55.130
It's like there was an explosion of light.

1378
00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:58.201
There was light and there was not this.

1379
00:56:58.201 --> 00:57:02.512
And so, in the most compassionate and loving way possible,

1380
00:57:02.512 --> 00:57:05.883
explain what you saw and what the opportunity in this is.

1381
00:57:05.883 --> 00:57:07.615
<v ->Yeah, we tend to habitually focus</v>

1382
00:57:07.615 --> 00:57:09.315
on the deconstructive side of it.

1383
00:57:09.315 --> 00:57:12.485
We love the drama, it's habitual.

1384
00:57:12.485 --> 00:57:15.069
Yeah, what I want people to understand is

1385
00:57:15.069 --> 00:57:19.347
that this is about the creation of life.

1386
00:57:19.347 --> 00:57:23.561
This is about the creation of a way of life

1387
00:57:23.561 --> 00:57:27.163
that the universal Creator intended to create.

1388
00:57:27.163 --> 00:57:31.345
This is about achieving our intended outcome together,

1389
00:57:31.345 --> 00:57:32.575
with this journey we've had

1390
00:57:32.575 --> 00:57:34.472
in this universe with the Creator.

1391
00:57:34.472 --> 00:57:37.048
To create this new way of life.

1392
00:57:37.048 --> 00:57:39.948
And to finally become masters

1393
00:57:39.948 --> 00:57:41.619
of the construct we call light.

1394
00:57:41.619 --> 00:57:44.920
So Mother Earth is now in the birthing process.

1395
00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:47.628
And she is about to give birth to a whole planetary race

1396
00:57:47.628 --> 00:57:50.128
of universal creators of love and light.

1397
00:57:50.128 --> 00:57:52.129
And that's what this is about.

1398
00:57:52.129 --> 00:57:54.221
That's what it's really all about.

1399
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:58.329
And it's good that we, okay, it's important to understand

1400
00:57:58.329 --> 00:58:00.401
and look at the processes and the control measures

1401
00:58:00.401 --> 00:58:04.240
and all that, but don't dwell on that constantly.

1402
00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:07.325
Otherwise you're just sucked in those drama vortexes.

1403
00:58:07.325 --> 00:58:10.304
Open up your hearts, open up your light,

1404
00:58:10.304 --> 00:58:13.451
expand, shine that beautiful, brilliant light that you are.

1405
00:58:13.451 --> 00:58:17.085
And realize that you are now in the process

1406
00:58:17.085 --> 00:58:21.386
of becoming what you intend, originally intended to become.

1407
00:58:21.386 --> 00:58:25.018
It's a beautiful thing.

1408
00:58:25.018 --> 00:58:26.865
This is about, I have a saying, it's called

1409
00:58:26.865 --> 00:58:30.226
"the beauty and the grace in the opening of a flower."

1410
00:58:30.226 --> 00:58:32.437
I mean, it's the wilderness of chaos.

1411
00:58:32.437 --> 00:58:35.198
And so, if we are to just continue to be that beauty

1412
00:58:35.198 --> 00:58:38.949
and that grace, to reconnect with our feminine within.

1413
00:58:38.949 --> 00:58:42.314
And to hold that space in such an integral way.

1414
00:58:42.314 --> 00:58:46.481
You see, grace is the most powerful force in the universe.

1415
00:58:46.481 --> 00:58:49.116
Using that, the words power and force

1416
00:58:49.116 --> 00:58:50.821
associated with the word grace,

1417
00:58:50.821 --> 00:58:52.862
might seem a bit strange for some.

1418
00:58:52.862 --> 00:58:55.295
But it's a way of explaining it.

1419
00:58:55.295 --> 00:59:00.002
It really is the greatest power this universe has, is grace.

1420
00:59:00.002 --> 00:59:02.935
And it's a state of being-ness, it's steadfast,

1421
00:59:02.935 --> 00:59:06.368
it's so strong, so powerful,

1422
00:59:06.368 --> 00:59:08.340
that when you are in that grace,

1423
00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:12.609
all those other energies of negative connotations

1424
00:59:12.609 --> 00:59:15.245
cannot exist in that state.

1425
00:59:15.245 --> 00:59:18.548
So, with the veil, how it's thinning, the veil is thinning.

1426
00:59:18.548 --> 00:59:21.416
What's happening is, I often talk about these openings

1427
00:59:21.416 --> 00:59:23.490
and these doorways that will occur.

1428
00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:26.185
And the way it works is that, at the moment

1429
00:59:26.185 --> 00:59:29.966
we're having moments of being our higher selves,

1430
00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:32.394
our fifth dimensional selves and above.

1431
00:59:32.394 --> 00:59:34.437
And we're being warned of that,

1432
00:59:34.437 --> 00:59:38.028
more and more of that everyday.

1433
00:59:38.028 --> 00:59:40.730
But, being more of that, it thins the veil out.

1434
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:42.104
It's getting thinner and thinner.

1435
00:59:42.104 --> 00:59:43.836
It'll get to the point where our higher self

1436
00:59:43.836 --> 00:59:46.738
will absorb the lower ego.

1437
00:59:46.738 --> 00:59:49.482
And, in that moment, the veil totally lifts.

1438
00:59:49.482 --> 00:59:52.749
And the higher self and the lower self merge,

1439
00:59:52.749 --> 00:59:54.949
and an opening will occur in this reality.

1440
00:59:54.949 --> 00:59:57.756
And we'll walk through that opening.

1441
00:59:57.756 --> 01:00:01.988
And that is the opening that is, can be labeled

1442
01:00:01.988 --> 01:00:05.292
or used to describe with vesica pisces.

1443
01:00:05.292 --> 01:00:07.229
And it's the womb of the mother.

1444
01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:10.692
And it's walking into this higher vibrational domain

1445
01:00:10.692 --> 01:00:12.769
on the Earth Mother.

1446
01:00:12.769 --> 01:00:15.339
Because Mother Earth needs to cleanse her lower ego.

1447
01:00:15.339 --> 01:00:16.904
And when she does go through the pole shift

1448
01:00:16.904 --> 01:00:19.911
and that cleansing process, we will be safe

1449
01:00:19.911 --> 01:00:23.305
from the processes of the lower,

1450
01:00:23.305 --> 01:00:25.650
excuse me, of the lower domains.

1451
01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:28.216
<v Regina>So, 2013.</v>

1452
01:00:28.216 --> 01:00:31.714
<v ->With 2013, yeah, see the cycle ends on an equinox.</v>

1453
01:00:31.714 --> 01:00:33.050
It doesn't end at the solstice.

1454
01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:36.833
A lot of people think the end is the 21st of December, 2012.

1455
01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:39.699
But it's actually the equinox after that,

1456
01:00:39.699 --> 01:00:40.734
is when the cycle ends.

1457
01:00:40.734 --> 01:00:44.334
Because, a solstice, everything is way out of balance.

1458
01:00:44.334 --> 01:00:47.800
You see, you got minimum darkness and maximum daylight.

1459
01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:50.267
Or you've got minimum daylight and maximum darkness.

1460
01:00:50.267 --> 01:00:52.310
So, the scales are way out of balance.

1461
01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:54.982
And what we are achieving is perfect balance.

1462
01:00:54.982 --> 01:00:58.121
So, the cycle needs to end on an equinox.

1463
01:00:58.121 --> 01:01:00.050
Where you've got equal amount of darkness

1464
01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:01.779
to equal amount of light.

1465
01:01:01.779 --> 01:01:04.129
That's where the scales are in perfect balance.

1466
01:01:04.129 --> 01:01:06.638
In ancient times, new year actually began

1467
01:01:06.638 --> 01:01:10.915
and finished on the equinox, not at the solstices.

1468
01:01:10.915 --> 01:01:13.111
So things have all been, sort of like,

1469
01:01:13.111 --> 01:01:18.081
put out of whack, harmonically.

1470
01:01:18.081 --> 01:01:19.839
It's interesting how you mentioned earlier

1471
01:01:19.839 --> 01:01:21.500
how so many people go forward in time,

1472
01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:22.701
and then they just see pure light

1473
01:01:22.701 --> 01:01:24.542
and this reality ceased to exist.

1474
01:01:24.542 --> 01:01:25.884
Then, you got some people that talk about,

1475
01:01:25.884 --> 01:01:27.483
they see a splitting of the Earth.

1476
01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:30.446
But that has to do with going off on tangents

1477
01:01:30.446 --> 01:01:32.554
on the timeline, that's a different process

1478
01:01:32.554 --> 01:01:34.908
that they don't, they're not aware of.

1479
01:01:34.908 --> 01:01:36.988
That's a big subject about timelines.

1480
01:01:36.988 --> 01:01:38.448
How you have the organic timeline

1481
01:01:38.448 --> 01:01:41.263
and then you have all the branches off the timelines.

1482
01:01:41.263 --> 01:01:42.854
And that's why we have so many ETs

1483
01:01:42.854 --> 01:01:45.963
that say, "Oh, we've come from your future."

1484
01:01:45.963 --> 01:01:48.629
These are races that surf timelines,

1485
01:01:48.629 --> 01:01:50.967
they traverse timelines, that's what they do.

1486
01:01:50.967 --> 01:01:54.670
And they always come back to this one at this point in time.

1487
01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:56.397
Always. It's always coming back

1488
01:01:56.397 --> 01:01:58.766
to this timeline for this Earth here.

1489
01:01:58.766 --> 01:02:01.171
'Cause this is the real one, this is the organic one.

1490
01:02:01.171 --> 01:02:03.310
All the others are tangents.

1491
01:02:03.310 --> 01:02:04.949
And so the natures of those realities

1492
01:02:04.949 --> 01:02:07.510
don't have the substance that this one does.

1493
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:09.915
<v Regina>So, on the day when you were shown</v>

1494
01:02:09.915 --> 01:02:14.657
the nature of all of it, when you were with your people.

1495
01:02:14.657 --> 01:02:17.743
How did you, what did this period,

1496
01:02:17.743 --> 01:02:20.563
this equinox in 2013,

1497
01:02:20.563 --> 01:02:23.305
spring equinox, feel like?

1498
01:02:23.305 --> 01:02:25.066
<v ->Well, I just wanna clarify that I didn't get this</v>

1499
01:02:25.066 --> 01:02:27.623
knowing 'cause my people showed it to me.

1500
01:02:27.623 --> 01:02:28.624
Yeah, I just wanna make that clear--

1501
01:02:28.624 --> 01:02:29.477
<v Regina>Yeah, you were taken--</v>

1502
01:02:29.477 --> 01:02:33.449
<v ->That I actually got the knowing because I went</v>

1503
01:02:33.449 --> 01:02:36.432
into the universe and traveled

1504
01:02:36.432 --> 01:02:37.516
the dimensions of the universe.

1505
01:02:37.516 --> 01:02:40.019
And also, I have this knowing from my relationship

1506
01:02:40.019 --> 01:02:43.279
with Mother Earth, and my relationship with Father Sun.

1507
01:02:43.279 --> 01:02:46.419
That's why I say to people, this information that I share,

1508
01:02:46.419 --> 01:02:48.458
not to take my word for it.

1509
01:02:48.458 --> 01:02:51.364
That I urge them

1510
01:02:51.364 --> 01:02:54.734
to once again reawaken,

1511
01:02:54.734 --> 01:02:56.926
in their conscious state, the connection that they have

1512
01:02:56.926 --> 01:02:58.880
with this planet and the solar system.

1513
01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:02.837
That they've chosen to incarnate onto and inside of.

1514
01:03:02.837 --> 01:03:04.277
And when you do that,

1515
01:03:04.277 --> 01:03:06.278
that's when that knowing is established.

1516
01:03:06.278 --> 01:03:07.523
Like, you really know it.

1517
01:03:07.523 --> 01:03:10.717
Because this is about the journey

1518
01:03:10.717 --> 01:03:13.119
of the collective human soul.

1519
01:03:13.119 --> 01:03:14.883
That's it having together with Mother Earth.

1520
01:03:14.883 --> 01:03:18.350
It's a journey we're taking through time together, you see.

1521
01:03:18.350 --> 01:03:22.329
And it's understanding that relationship, once again.

1522
01:03:22.329 --> 01:03:27.029
As a humanity, and with the Earth Mother, together.

1523
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:31.372
We chose this and she said

1524
01:03:31.372 --> 01:03:33.798
that she would facilitate this for us.

1525
01:03:33.798 --> 01:03:37.434
So, when you reconnect with that relationship,

1526
01:03:37.434 --> 01:03:40.383
reengage in that relationship, it's there.

1527
01:03:40.383 --> 01:03:42.402
You just have to consciously reengage in it.

1528
01:03:42.402 --> 01:03:47.252
Just to reactivate it once again in your conscious mind.

1529
01:03:47.252 --> 01:03:49.649
In your awakened, conscious mind.

1530
01:03:49.649 --> 01:03:52.488
So, when you do that, that's where the knowledge,

1531
01:03:52.488 --> 01:03:55.453
the memory of this journey, and the knowledge

1532
01:03:55.453 --> 01:03:58.150
of what's about to transpire, that's where it is.

1533
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:59.492
<v Regina>So, when you did that,</v>

1534
01:03:59.492 --> 01:04:01.882
and as you have done that over time,

1535
01:04:01.882 --> 01:04:04.704
how does it express itself, what does it feel like?

1536
01:04:04.704 --> 01:04:08.043
<v ->To me, it is the understanding that things</v>

1537
01:04:08.043 --> 01:04:09.231
are going to change very quickly

1538
01:04:09.231 --> 01:04:12.743
over a very short period of time.

1539
01:04:12.743 --> 01:04:14.749
A lot of people would like to go very slowly

1540
01:04:14.749 --> 01:04:16.808
over a long period of time.

1541
01:04:16.808 --> 01:04:20.083
And part of me wants it to be like that, too.

1542
01:04:20.083 --> 01:04:23.920
But it's not reality. And I'll explain why.

1543
01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:27.275
Is, the people who want it to be easy

1544
01:04:27.275 --> 01:04:28.887
over a long period of time,

1545
01:04:28.887 --> 01:04:31.163
they have lost touch with their dark side.

1546
01:04:31.163 --> 01:04:34.955
So, they've forgotten the behavior of the dark side.

1547
01:04:34.955 --> 01:04:37.528
So, you gotta put yourselves in the shoes of the darkside.

1548
01:04:37.528 --> 01:04:41.271
There are beings who can not let go of this reality

1549
01:04:41.271 --> 01:04:43.132
and cannot let go of humanity.

1550
01:04:43.132 --> 01:04:46.862
So, our consciousness is rising up,

1551
01:04:46.862 --> 01:04:49.371
and they're putting the clamps on even tighter.

1552
01:04:49.371 --> 01:04:51.144
And our consciousness is rising up,

1553
01:04:51.144 --> 01:04:53.254
and they're putting the clamps down even tighter.

1554
01:04:53.254 --> 01:04:56.353
And there's this pressure cooker situation occurring.

1555
01:04:56.353 --> 01:05:00.403
It is so tight. It's called the "big squeeze," you know?

1556
01:05:00.403 --> 01:05:01.189
<v Regina>And you feel it.</v>

1557
01:05:01.189 --> 01:05:02.732
<v ->And you can feel the intensity of everything.</v>

1558
01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.066
And it's squeezing, and squeezing,

1559
01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:05.793
and squeezing, and squeezing.

1560
01:05:05.793 --> 01:05:09.137
And it's just gonna pop one day real soon, you know?

1561
01:05:09.137 --> 01:05:10.559
And that's what's happening.

1562
01:05:10.559 --> 01:05:12.297
'Cause they're hanging on, and they're hanging on,

1563
01:05:12.297 --> 01:05:14.608
and they're hanging on, and they're not gonna let go.

1564
01:05:14.608 --> 01:05:15.975
'Til they're forced to leave.

1565
01:05:15.975 --> 01:05:17.536
And it's gotta be by force

1566
01:05:17.536 --> 01:05:18.705
that they're gonna get out of here.

1567
01:05:18.705 --> 01:05:21.379
Unfortunately, that's reality.

1568
01:05:21.379 --> 01:05:24.246
So, that's not ideology, okay?

1569
01:05:24.246 --> 01:05:28.377
So, you've got your ideological considerations,

1570
01:05:28.377 --> 01:05:30.679
and thoughts, and aspirations,

1571
01:05:30.679 --> 01:05:33.945
as to how people would like it to transpire.

1572
01:05:33.945 --> 01:05:36.251
And then there's reality.

1573
01:05:36.251 --> 01:05:37.863
<v Regina>So how do you perceive it?</v>

1574
01:05:37.863 --> 01:05:40.697
<v ->So, this will increase, increase, increase.</v>

1575
01:05:40.697 --> 01:05:42.232
And very soon, there's gonna be

1576
01:05:42.232 --> 01:05:44.198
an event that will take place.

1577
01:05:44.198 --> 01:05:46.335
And if there's one thing I wanna warn humanity about,

1578
01:05:46.335 --> 01:05:48.269
and getting back, it is a bit of a negative

1579
01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:49.708
from one perspective.

1580
01:05:49.708 --> 01:05:52.265
But it's a huge positive from another.

1581
01:05:52.265 --> 01:05:54.372
And that is, that if you look back over time,

1582
01:05:54.372 --> 01:05:57.080
and you look back to 9/11 and events before that,

1583
01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:00.913
you notice that all these events play out, have played out,

1584
01:06:00.913 --> 01:06:04.218
and they've been used to mind control humanity.

1585
01:06:04.218 --> 01:06:07.089
So, what I see people talking about out there

1586
01:06:07.089 --> 01:06:10.227
is the next mind control event.

1587
01:06:10.227 --> 01:06:14.067
I'm calling it a pending global mind control event.

1588
01:06:14.067 --> 01:06:15.593
What's it gonna be?

1589
01:06:15.593 --> 01:06:17.666
And not so much, what's it gonna be,

1590
01:06:17.666 --> 01:06:19.398
but get ready that it's gonna happen.

1591
01:06:19.398 --> 01:06:20.573
<v Regina>And what is it?</v>

1592
01:06:20.573 --> 01:06:22.767
<v ->Well, it could be a fake alien invasion.</v>

1593
01:06:22.767 --> 01:06:24.323
I actually don't know exactly what it's going to be.

1594
01:06:24.323 --> 01:06:25.031
<v Regina>Well, we've heard that</v>

1595
01:06:25.031 --> 01:06:26.043
from other people, as well,

1596
01:06:26.043 --> 01:06:27.481
That's being planned.
<v ->That's right, that's right.</v>

1597
01:06:27.481 --> 01:06:28.895
<v Regina>We know the technology's there to do it.</v>

1598
01:06:28.895 --> 01:06:31.690
<v ->Yeah, it is, it is there to do it.</v>

1599
01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:34.644
And, it could be the comet, Elenin, might play a role.

1600
01:06:34.644 --> 01:06:37.953
Or it could be the big red guy that's coming in behind it.

1601
01:06:37.953 --> 01:06:39.594
That might play a very big role.

1602
01:06:39.594 --> 01:06:42.496
'Cause it's there and it's coming, okay?

1603
01:06:42.496 --> 01:06:44.430
So, how they're gonna play all that out, I don't know.

1604
01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:47.690
'Cause for myself, personally, I traveled into the future

1605
01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:50.590
and I saw, I called it "the time of the two moons."

1606
01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:52.001
So, I saw our moon in the sky,

1607
01:06:52.001 --> 01:06:54.742
and I saw a big red moon next to our moon.

1608
01:06:54.742 --> 01:06:56.038
And it was a little bit bigger,

1609
01:06:56.038 --> 01:06:59.205
but I knew this thing was huge and was much further out.

1610
01:06:59.205 --> 01:07:01.816
And, I've written about that and talked about that.

1611
01:07:01.816 --> 01:07:03.476
So, it's the time of the two moons.

1612
01:07:03.476 --> 01:07:05.280
Which happened years ago for me.

1613
01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:09.171
So, I've always known that this was coming.

1614
01:07:09.171 --> 01:07:11.543
And so, one day soon, between now

1615
01:07:11.543 --> 01:07:13.123
and about the middle of next year,

1616
01:07:13.123 --> 01:07:14.772
these events are gonna play out.

1617
01:07:14.772 --> 01:07:17.762
And it's all designed to distract humanity

1618
01:07:17.762 --> 01:07:19.832
from reconnecting with their hearts

1619
01:07:19.832 --> 01:07:21.632
with the heart of Mother Earth.

1620
01:07:21.632 --> 01:07:24.561
And seeing the process through, with her.

1621
01:07:24.561 --> 01:07:27.292
They wanna create the biggest distractions they can,

1622
01:07:27.292 --> 01:07:29.400
so they can lure humanity off-world.

1623
01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:30.960
'Cause if you've got this big, red thing coming

1624
01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:34.040
that's gonna destroy everything, in their eyes,

1625
01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.076
then they're gonna come here with their ships,

1626
01:07:36.076 --> 01:07:39.417
and they're gonna "save" you, you see.

1627
01:07:39.417 --> 01:07:41.788
<v Regina>And, so as we go through this transition,</v>

1628
01:07:41.788 --> 01:07:44.189
as humanity goes through this transition,

1629
01:07:44.189 --> 01:07:46.592
what is the beauty in this?

1630
01:07:46.592 --> 01:07:49.462
What did you see on the elevated,

1631
01:07:49.462 --> 01:07:52.564
beautiful, transformative scale?

1632
01:07:52.564 --> 01:07:55.232
<v ->Well, Mother Earth bursts into a body of light.</v>

1633
01:07:55.232 --> 01:07:57.189
And we birth with her.

1634
01:07:57.189 --> 01:08:00.602
That was the most amazing thing to experience.

1635
01:08:00.602 --> 01:08:05.310
And, what she looks like, 'cause I kept asking Mother Earth,

1636
01:08:05.310 --> 01:08:07.843
"What's your color gonna be, what's your color gonna be?"

1637
01:08:07.843 --> 01:08:09.477
And I keep getting magenta.

1638
01:08:09.477 --> 01:08:11.715
I just can't get past the color magenta.

1639
01:08:11.715 --> 01:08:13.719
Which is amazing, 'cause other people have talked to me

1640
01:08:13.719 --> 01:08:16.424
about that as well, ever since I started talking about it,

1641
01:08:16.424 --> 01:08:18.245
they've gone, well I'm not that crazy after all.

1642
01:08:18.245 --> 01:08:21.256
Because I kept experiencing magenta in my life everywhere.

1643
01:08:21.256 --> 01:08:22.395
<v Regina>Well, classically, magenta</v>

1644
01:08:22.395 --> 01:08:24.661
is the feminine version of orange.

1645
01:08:24.661 --> 01:08:26.599
Which is very sexual in nature.

1646
01:08:26.599 --> 01:08:27.815
<v ->Okay, I wasn't aware of that.</v>

1647
01:08:27.815 --> 01:08:28.703
<v Regina>Birth-oriented, yeah.</v>

1648
01:08:28.703 --> 01:08:30.630
<v ->Yeah, birth-oriented, yeah.</v>

1649
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:35.038
And I had a lady come to me in one of my talks at the end,

1650
01:08:35.038 --> 01:08:38.505
and say, "I got picked up by my galactic family

1651
01:08:38.505 --> 01:08:40.468
"and they took me," and I had an e-mail

1652
01:08:40.468 --> 01:08:43.577
to do with this subject from someone else, as well.

1653
01:08:43.577 --> 01:08:46.151
"They took me forward in time and they showed me the Earth,"

1654
01:08:46.151 --> 01:08:48.485
and she was a magenta star.

1655
01:08:48.485 --> 01:08:50.561
And it's just beautiful to hear

1656
01:08:50.561 --> 01:08:52.356
people talking about those experiences.

1657
01:08:52.356 --> 01:08:55.423
Because that's how I know she's going to be.

1658
01:08:55.423 --> 01:08:57.263
And, then our embodiments will be

1659
01:08:57.263 --> 01:09:00.686
pure universal consciousness.

1660
01:09:00.686 --> 01:09:02.932
No energetic centers at all, it will just be

1661
01:09:02.932 --> 01:09:06.132
the expression of pure universal love and light.

1662
01:09:06.132 --> 01:09:08.643
And, then an aspect of our consciousness will go

1663
01:09:08.643 --> 01:09:11.945
and create our own universe via the construct of light.

1664
01:09:11.945 --> 01:09:13.513
And, then the embodiment that is

1665
01:09:13.513 --> 01:09:15.438
on the ascended Mother Earth,

1666
01:09:15.438 --> 01:09:19.313
which will be like a star from down here...

1667
01:09:19.313 --> 01:09:22.143
We have obligations and responsibilities

1668
01:09:22.143 --> 01:09:24.622
to life inside this universe.

1669
01:09:24.622 --> 01:09:27.922
So, instead of having a single Christ

1670
01:09:27.922 --> 01:09:30.261
going around the universe doing the work,

1671
01:09:30.261 --> 01:09:31.923
there's now gonna be a whole planetary race

1672
01:09:31.923 --> 01:09:35.263
full of Christs, Buddhas, Krishnas, Allahs,

1673
01:09:35.263 --> 01:09:37.599
whatever label you wanna use, you know?

1674
01:09:37.599 --> 01:09:41.080
And in the true meaning of those words.

1675
01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:44.475
And going back, and whatever races, galaxies,

1676
01:09:44.475 --> 01:09:46.808
dimensional paradigms we're affiliated with,

1677
01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:51.216
we go back and we say, "See? We did it. We did it.

1678
01:09:51.216 --> 01:09:53.445
"After all this time, we've done it.

1679
01:09:53.445 --> 01:09:55.847
"And this is what we can accomplish."

1680
01:09:55.847 --> 01:09:57.691
And now, there's other planetary systems

1681
01:09:57.691 --> 01:09:59.584
that are being set up like this one

1682
01:09:59.584 --> 01:10:01.729
to facilitate that process.

1683
01:10:01.729 --> 01:10:03.465
The same process that we had here.

1684
01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:05.322
'Cause it's fool-proof.

1685
01:10:05.322 --> 01:10:06.460
<v Regina>You've looked at it</v>

1686
01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:08.498
from the future, and we did it.

1687
01:10:08.498 --> 01:10:11.956
<v ->We did it. We've done it.</v>

1688
01:10:11.956 --> 01:10:15.992
The future's already happened, we've done it. Yeah.

1689
01:10:15.992 --> 01:10:16.733
<v Regina>Thank you.</v>

1690
01:10:16.733 --> 01:10:17.736
<v ->We're there.</v>

1691
01:10:17.736 --> 01:10:19.135
(both laugh)

1692
01:10:19.135 --> 01:10:20.544
<v Regina>On that note, thank you so much</v>

1693
01:10:20.544 --> 01:10:23.006
for your time, George, that's beautiful.

1694
01:10:23.006 --> 01:10:25.956
<v ->Honor, truly, and a pleasure, truly.</v>

1695
01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:30.982
<v ->If you're interested in more on the array</v>

1696
01:10:30.982 --> 01:10:33.227
of subjects discussed here, you can check

into our interviews with Stephen Bassett and Kim Carlsberg.

1698
01:10:36.393 --> 01:10:38.265
As well as all seven of our interviews
