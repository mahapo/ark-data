00:00:00.343 --> 00:00:03.558
<v ->What would a world without beauty and creativity be like?</v>

2
00:00:03.862 --> 00:00:06.348
I think most of us would answer, "not worth living in."

3
00:00:06.348 --> 00:00:10.053
Still, how much time do we take to create beauty?

4
00:00:10.273 --> 00:00:12.459
Be it music, drawing, sewing, woodwork

5
00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:13.893
poetry or anything at all.

6
00:00:13.942 --> 00:00:17.349
Some people, like Chris Spheeris make a life of creating.

7
00:00:17.675 --> 00:00:20.117
Aside from selling more than a million CD's

8
00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:21.946
and winning awards for his music,

9
00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:24.210
Chris creates something new everyday.

10
00:00:24.355 --> 00:00:26.584
From photography, gardening and poetry.

11
00:00:26.584 --> 00:00:30.290
To fixing old clocks, Chris says, "we were born to create."

12
00:00:30.324 --> 00:00:35.324 line:15% 
(soft instrumental music)

13
00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:40.873
You are the most creative person I've ever met

14
00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:43.241
personally in my lifetime and the reason is

15
00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:45.491
not only because you've had an incredible

16
00:00:45.491 --> 00:00:47.720
career in music, but also this

17
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.221
extends to everything you do in life.

18
00:00:50.323 --> 00:00:53.171
Photography, renovation of homes.

19
00:00:53.171 --> 00:00:55.197
You're like this incredible artistic

20
00:00:55.197 --> 00:00:57.704
designer for architectural forms.

21
00:00:57.704 --> 00:01:00.189
There's nothing you touch that doesn't turn

22
00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:01.943
into something really beautiful.

23
00:01:02.397 --> 00:01:04.317
And I'm not just saying that to compliment you.

24
00:01:04.317 --> 00:01:07.666
I'm laying the foundation for a conversation

25
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:10.727
about creativity and why this is not what's

26
00:01:10.727 --> 00:01:12.556
happening in most of our lives.

27
00:01:12.818 --> 00:01:15.083
It's just not happening in most of our lives.

28
00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:17.340
So let's start with when you're a little kid.

29
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.499
I always like to start at the beginning.

30
00:01:19.782 --> 00:01:22.108
What was going on in your life that you

31
00:01:22.108 --> 00:01:23.979
started sensing you had to create.

32
00:01:25.073 --> 00:01:27.771
<v ->I think, right away I'm thinking of the imprint.</v>

33
00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:31.184
What that means to me is, I was imprinted to feel boundless.

34
00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:36.010
I wasn't spoiled, not in that sense, not materially.

35
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.721
But I was imprinted to feel like I could create anything.

36
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:43.198
Play was always encouraged.

37
00:01:43.198 --> 00:01:44.883
Anything that had to do with the

38
00:01:44.883 --> 00:01:47.624
mind or with art, with music.

39
00:01:47.624 --> 00:01:50.365
Any of that as a child was always nourished,

40
00:01:50.365 --> 00:01:52.573
encouraged, and never judged.

41
00:01:52.573 --> 00:01:54.312
That was a big thing, you know judgement

42
00:01:54.312 --> 00:01:56.612
is gonna be a theme I think in this conversation

43
00:01:56.612 --> 00:01:58.702
because creativity and judgement,

44
00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:01.523
they work against each other completely.

45
00:02:01.764 --> 00:02:03.022
Judgement's sort of the antithesis

46
00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:04.707
of the energy of creativity.

47
00:02:05.093 --> 00:02:09.870
<v ->So as a kid my sister played classical piano.</v>

48
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.793
My mother was a painter, she also liked to

49
00:02:12.793 --> 00:02:14.819
sculpt a lot of things around the house.

50
00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.539
My grandmother used to do everything you

51
00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:19.000
could imagine on the house from,

52
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.454
she would build forts for us and tree houses.

53
00:02:21.454 --> 00:02:23.853
She would fix appliances and then she would

54
00:02:23.853 --> 00:02:25.987
make her own yogurt and cheeses and this and that.

55
00:02:25.987 --> 00:02:29.442
She was born in a Greek village, like a Greek town.

56
00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:34.574
There was so much creativity in the house.

57
00:02:35.944 --> 00:02:38.006
Plus we were always encouraged to have games

58
00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:39.948
around us and music around us.

59
00:02:39.948 --> 00:02:42.330
And my mother gave us records from all different styles.

60
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.228
Lots of classical music was around.

61
00:02:44.228 --> 00:02:47.005
I remember this incredible collection of music.

62
00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:50.429
Traditional American music, they used to have old

63
00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:53.362
slave themes and old Civil War songs.

64
00:02:53.362 --> 00:02:55.538
Things that were just left-field.

65
00:02:55.538 --> 00:02:57.533
So we got all these influences.

66
00:02:57.533 --> 00:03:00.722
I remember there was never a moment where

67
00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:01.810
my parents wouldn't hesitate to

68
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.175
buy me the new Beatle record.

69
00:03:03.175 --> 00:03:05.500
I would wait till the day they would come out.

70
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.495
And they would give me my, in those days it was

71
00:03:07.495 --> 00:03:09.623
probably like, I don't know like a $1.99 or something--

72
00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:10.532
<v Voiceover>Allowance</v>

73
00:03:10.532 --> 00:03:11.910
<v ->Whatever it was, and I'd run</v>

74
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:12.759
and get the thing right away.

75
00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.423
And The Beatles were, I think The Beatles had a

76
00:03:14.423 --> 00:03:16.365
huge influence on me in addition to

77
00:03:16.365 --> 00:03:20.295
my family and their encouragement.

78
00:03:20.295 --> 00:03:23.238
But I think the most important thing generally for me to say

79
00:03:23.238 --> 00:03:25.659
about my childhood is I had a lot of confidence

80
00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.144
in the sense that I was never told, "I couldn't create this

81
00:03:28.144 --> 00:03:29.765
"I couldn't do that," it was like, "Try it."

82
00:03:29.765 --> 00:03:33.518
You know, let's just do it, have fun, see what happens.

83
00:03:33.518 --> 00:03:37.144
And the other thing I remember is when I was a kid,

84
00:03:37.144 --> 00:03:40.483
my mother gave me canvases and acrylic paints

85
00:03:40.483 --> 00:03:43.042
and oil paints sometimes and a palette knife and some

86
00:03:43.042 --> 00:03:44.994
brushes and said, "Here, just do whatever you want."

87
00:03:44.994 --> 00:03:49.218
And I created a whole exhibit of abstract art by

88
00:03:49.218 --> 00:03:51.111
the time I was, I think 11.

89
00:03:51.842 --> 00:03:52.721
<v Voiceover>Wow</v>

90
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:54.859
<v ->But it was all about that, it was a spirit of openness</v>

91
00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.992
and support and non-judgement that I think had

92
00:03:56.992 --> 00:04:01.248
everything to do with inspiring me and encouraging

93
00:04:01.248 --> 00:04:03.423
and nurturing me to be a creative person.

94
00:04:03.423 --> 00:04:04.682
<v Voiceover>And most people don't</v>

95
00:04:04.682 --> 00:04:06.239
have it usually to that degree.

96
00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.679
And furthermore, then you put yourself into the systems

97
00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:11.930
that have been created, which we'll talk about later on.

98
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.119
If you haven't had it squeezed out by then with a lot of

99
00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:16.954
self-judgement and judgement from others, it certainly

100
00:04:16.954 --> 00:04:19.780
will be by the time you hit your pubescent years.

101
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.462
And so you did't have that, it was fostered along the way.

102
00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:23.977
And what happened with music?

103
00:04:23.977 --> 00:04:26.366
Because you really became known for music,

104
00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:28.981
although poetry as well, ultimately.

105
00:04:28.981 --> 00:04:32.036
But how did that start evolving for you?

106
00:04:33.258 --> 00:04:34.948
In a serious manner?

107
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.324
And I also wanna know where judgement started coming in?

108
00:04:38.324 --> 00:04:40.393
Where you started having to evaluate,

109
00:04:40.393 --> 00:04:43.102
"Am I good enough to do this for real?" and how that works?

110
00:04:43.102 --> 00:04:45.843
Music, judgement, that's part of my story.

111
00:04:47.343 --> 00:04:50.643
I mentioned The Beatles because I think The Beatles

112
00:04:50.643 --> 00:04:53.384
have to be the most expansive, creative musical group,

113
00:04:53.384 --> 00:04:56.842
at least pop musical group to ever have walked the planet.

114
00:04:56.842 --> 00:05:01.258
And being in the spirit of their creativity.

115
00:05:01.258 --> 00:05:03.529
And I'm talking about vibration now.

116
00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:05.385
I'm talking about how they transmitted this

117
00:05:05.385 --> 00:05:07.966
incredibly high vibration of creativity through

118
00:05:07.966 --> 00:05:10.356
their music on a completely abstract level.

119
00:05:10.356 --> 00:05:13.982
And so, not only was it so boundless, it affected

120
00:05:13.982 --> 00:05:17.630
the entire planet, but my own personal experience is,

121
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.459
they inspired me on a level that I could never even

122
00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:23.272
be in touch with it was so high.

123
00:05:23.272 --> 00:05:26.056
And so it was always like listening to The Beatles

124
00:05:26.056 --> 00:05:28.115
constantly was my mantra.

125
00:05:28.115 --> 00:05:31.462
And I think that, it literally, if you wanna talk in

126
00:05:31.462 --> 00:05:33.836
sort of New-Agey kind of terms, it raised my

127
00:05:33.836 --> 00:05:35.671
vibration constantly as a kid.

128
00:05:35.671 --> 00:05:38.807
And the higher they went, I was with them all along the way.

129
00:05:38.807 --> 00:05:40.705
Through the psychedelic phase and this and that.

130
00:05:40.705 --> 00:05:42.094
And I was very young.

131
00:05:43.034 --> 00:05:45.199
When I saw The Beatles I think I was eight years old

132
00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.685
and that was when they first started touring.

133
00:05:47.685 --> 00:05:49.733
So even by the time they finished I was

134
00:05:49.733 --> 00:05:52.004
only about 13 or something like that.

135
00:05:52.004 --> 00:05:53.466
So I was still quite young.

136
00:05:53.466 --> 00:05:58.466
But I was able to really learn about poetry, writing, music.

137
00:05:58.532 --> 00:06:01.417
My ears, my mind was so trained for them.

138
00:06:01.417 --> 00:06:04.371
Fashion, you know lots of things, style.

139
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:06.483
The way they handled their interviews, the way they talked,

140
00:06:06.483 --> 00:06:08.447
the way that they ran around and jumped

141
00:06:08.447 --> 00:06:09.443
around and played in their movies.

142
00:06:09.443 --> 00:06:11.117
Play, they were all about play

143
00:06:11.117 --> 00:06:13.304
in their films and in their interviews.

144
00:06:13.304 --> 00:06:15.362
Huge influence on me.

145
00:06:16.452 --> 00:06:21.138
So I was shy as a musician when I was quite young.

146
00:06:21.138 --> 00:06:24.434
I mean I had early experience on the piano.

147
00:06:24.434 --> 00:06:27.079
We had a baby grand piano in our living room

148
00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:30.055
and I used to just play abstractly.

149
00:06:30.055 --> 00:06:31.975
I would just hit the low notes and

150
00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:34.065
imagine monsters and this and that.

151
00:06:34.065 --> 00:06:35.836
Go to the high notes and of course

152
00:06:35.836 --> 00:06:36.998
it was the fairies, whatever else.

153
00:06:36.998 --> 00:06:38.758
I would just kind of play impressionistically,

154
00:06:38.758 --> 00:06:41.777
but it wouldn't sound like music, it would just be sound.

155
00:06:41.777 --> 00:06:44.984
So I was just sort of free to play on the piano--

156
00:06:44.984 --> 00:06:47.352
<v Voiceover>And no one came over and tried to correct you?</v>

157
00:06:47.352 --> 00:06:48.301
<v ->Oh no</v>

158
00:06:48.301 --> 00:06:50.136
<v Voiceover>That's so good.</v>

159
00:06:50.136 --> 00:06:51.714
<v ->My sister had to go through the discipline.</v>

160
00:06:51.714 --> 00:06:52.973
She was learning classical piano,

161
00:06:52.973 --> 00:06:54.711
so my ears were being trained that way.

162
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:57.943
All right so, here is where a major

163
00:06:57.943 --> 00:06:59.308
part of my story comes in too.

164
00:06:59.308 --> 00:07:02.188
Because when I was, let's say about four years old,

165
00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:04.652
I used to sing to my mom and she

166
00:07:04.652 --> 00:07:06.135
taught me this song Baby Face,

167
00:07:06.135 --> 00:07:08.876
"Baby face, you got the cutest little baby,"

168
00:07:08.876 --> 00:07:10.134
okay so I used to sing that to her.

169
00:07:10.134 --> 00:07:11.542
So can you imagine how adorable a little four

170
00:07:11.542 --> 00:07:13.707
or five year old, whatever he was, would sing to his mom.

171
00:07:13.707 --> 00:07:15.883
So one day I was singing that song to her

172
00:07:15.883 --> 00:07:17.003
and my brother walked in the room

173
00:07:17.003 --> 00:07:18.251
and started laughing at me.

174
00:07:18.251 --> 00:07:22.016
And from about five years old till 12, I never sang a note

175
00:07:22.016 --> 00:07:24.576
in public, in front of anybody, I was shamed.

176
00:07:24.576 --> 00:07:27.456
You know my older brother, we were I'd have to say

177
00:07:27.456 --> 00:07:30.400
competitive sibling rivalry, all this kind of stuff.

178
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.511
And basically, innocently he shamed me from singing.

179
00:07:34.511 --> 00:07:36.655
And I didn't even sing in music class

180
00:07:36.655 --> 00:07:38.511
when I was in grade school.

181
00:07:38.511 --> 00:07:38.790
<v Voiceover>Really?</v>

182
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.369
<v ->The teacher would come up to me and say,</v>

183
00:07:40.369 --> 00:07:42.128
"Look you're a nice kid, but you've gotta sing

184
00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.475
"cause you're setting a bad example for the other students."

185
00:07:44.475 --> 00:07:45.520
I'm like, "I'm sorry".

186
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.056
Then she said, "Well just mouth it then."

187
00:07:47.056 --> 00:07:49.168
So I used to mouth it silently during music

188
00:07:49.168 --> 00:07:51.045
class till I was about 12 or 13.

189
00:07:51.045 --> 00:07:53.690
Just cause I was ashamed of my voice.

190
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.229
<v Voiceover>And you've gone through periods of your career</v>

191
00:07:56.229 --> 00:07:58.938
where you really did mostly non-vocals,

192
00:07:58.938 --> 00:08:01.306
instrumentals only for a long periods of time.

193
00:08:01.306 --> 00:08:03.652
Was that still connected back in with that?

194
00:08:03.652 --> 00:08:07.513
Cause you had done a stage where you did come out with

195
00:08:07.513 --> 00:08:10.927
vocals on an album and then it kind of

196
00:08:10.927 --> 00:08:12.804
disappeared again for a very long time.

197
00:08:12.804 --> 00:08:17.636
<v ->Well here's part of my healing process,</v>

198
00:08:17.636 --> 00:08:18.937
my spiritual process.

199
00:08:18.937 --> 00:08:23.225
By the time I was 19 I was writing songs.

200
00:08:23.225 --> 00:08:25.550
I had been discovered, this is

201
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.824
how funny my singing career went.

202
00:08:28.824 --> 00:08:30.929
When I was in high school I went to a...

203
00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.185
My junior and senior year I went to a

204
00:08:33.185 --> 00:08:35.979
private small high school, really adorable place,

205
00:08:35.979 --> 00:08:37.675
350 kids in the whole high school.

206
00:08:37.675 --> 00:08:40.341
And I was kind of shy so I used to skip lunch.

207
00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:43.360
And I used to bring a bag lunch, I know I skipped lunch.

208
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.408
I didn't want to be out with all these kids surrounding me.

209
00:08:45.408 --> 00:08:46.304
I was feeling really shy.

210
00:08:46.304 --> 00:08:47.744
<v Voiceover>Skip lunch, where did you go?</v>

211
00:08:47.744 --> 00:08:48.981
<v ->I went into the auditorium and I played</v>

212
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:50.997
the piano and I brought my guitar.

213
00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:54.367
And so I was in the gym and it sounded so good in there

214
00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.362
that I would practice the piano and play my guitar.

215
00:08:56.362 --> 00:08:58.634
And this is what I'd do at lunch and I'd have

216
00:08:58.634 --> 00:09:00.095
a little bag lunch so by the time hour was over

217
00:09:00.095 --> 00:09:03.044
I would've played and performed for nobody and eaten.

218
00:09:03.044 --> 00:09:06.969
So one day the singing choir director, music director

219
00:09:06.969 --> 00:09:08.409
of the school, he walked in

220
00:09:08.409 --> 00:09:09.934
during lunch hour and he heard me.

221
00:09:09.934 --> 00:09:12.099
I didn't hear him, he came in the back and the door was open

222
00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:17.157
and he very discreetly and respectfully came up to me

223
00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:18.853
and said, "You know, that sounds pretty good, would you

224
00:09:18.853 --> 00:09:21.135
"consider singing a song at one of our concerts?

225
00:09:21.135 --> 00:09:23.034
"You don't have to join the choir, you don't have to do

226
00:09:23.034 --> 00:09:24.655
"anything, just play whatever you want.

227
00:09:24.655 --> 00:09:25.871
"Any song you want to play."

228
00:09:25.871 --> 00:09:29.370
He was so sweet and his attitude

229
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.791
was so encouraging that I went for it.

230
00:09:31.791 --> 00:09:34.361
And so I started singing in public when I was,

231
00:09:34.361 --> 00:09:38.521
I guess I was 15 years old, yeah 16 years old,

232
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:41.539
did my first thing in public in front of a high school

233
00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:45.251
parental audience at a high school choir concert.

234
00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:46.510
<v Voiceover>Were you playing,</v>

235
00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:47.811
were you accompanying yourself too?

236
00:09:47.811 --> 00:09:50.104
<v ->I played guitar and I sang Father and Son by Cat Stevens.</v>

237
00:09:50.104 --> 00:09:51.683
And I dedicated it to my dad.

238
00:09:51.683 --> 00:09:54.957
Yeah it was adorable and that was

239
00:09:54.957 --> 00:09:56.141
getting me out a little bit.

240
00:09:56.141 --> 00:09:59.000
And I think there is a healing process in

241
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.765
learning and allowing, I got used to

242
00:10:02.765 --> 00:10:05.730
allowing my voice to come out.

243
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.412
And this of course is a metaphor where...

244
00:10:11.022 --> 00:10:14.145
From four or five years old till now,

245
00:10:14.145 --> 00:10:17.099
it's been a healing process to me to come out and sing

246
00:10:17.099 --> 00:10:20.577
and learn to love my own voice or accept my own voice

247
00:10:20.577 --> 00:10:24.011
or realize it is the voice I have.

248
00:10:24.011 --> 00:10:28.939
Now if you wanna do a parallel between my process and just

249
00:10:28.939 --> 00:10:33.162
allowing myself just to be as a being.

250
00:10:33.162 --> 00:10:36.000
Which to me, when you allow yourself to be,

251
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.834
you allow yourself to be creative.

252
00:10:37.834 --> 00:10:40.042
Because you are basically just

253
00:10:40.042 --> 00:10:41.642
channelling creative energy constantly.

254
00:10:41.642 --> 00:10:42.634
<v Voiceover>That's what I was</v>

255
00:10:42.634 --> 00:10:44.095
going to ask you next, so exactly.

256
00:10:44.095 --> 00:10:45.471
<v ->Here's where it comes.</v>

257
00:10:45.471 --> 00:10:48.607
All right, so in my life I have

258
00:10:48.607 --> 00:10:51.177
purposefully been out on stage singing.

259
00:10:51.177 --> 00:10:53.460
Yes I did it for quite a while

260
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.828
and then I stopped for several years.

261
00:10:55.828 --> 00:10:58.355
But there's a different reason for that.

262
00:10:58.355 --> 00:11:01.278
And then I picked it up again and I've been singing since.

263
00:11:01.278 --> 00:11:04.862
I finally have gotten to realize that my voice is

264
00:11:04.862 --> 00:11:07.688
very human, it it what it is, it's my gift.

265
00:11:07.688 --> 00:11:10.312
It is my vehicle that is unique.

266
00:11:10.312 --> 00:11:12.819
It's the only voice that sounds like that

267
00:11:12.819 --> 00:11:15.837
in the world and maybe in history too.

268
00:11:15.837 --> 00:11:19.645
So I'm just accepting that and that becomes part

269
00:11:19.645 --> 00:11:22.855
of my deep inner process of realizing that it's

270
00:11:22.855 --> 00:11:26.354
not about my own conception of who I think I am.

271
00:11:26.354 --> 00:11:27.964
That to me is the block.

272
00:11:27.964 --> 00:11:30.844
The more I think of who I am and my identity

273
00:11:30.844 --> 00:11:34.444
and my ego identity and myself creating all this

274
00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:37.409
and all that, the smaller it all gets, okay?

275
00:11:37.409 --> 00:11:40.619
Like the external plays so much a part on my own

276
00:11:40.619 --> 00:11:44.317
self-concept that I'm sort of constantly

277
00:11:44.317 --> 00:11:46.591
judging myself if I allow that to happen.

278
00:11:46.591 --> 00:11:49.076
<v Voiceover>And that's very contractive in nature.</v>

279
00:11:49.076 --> 00:11:50.740
<v ->That's what I'm saying, you just allow the outter</v>

280
00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.575
to come into where you're, yeah you're very constricted.

281
00:11:52.575 --> 00:11:56.297
On the other hand, along with that,

282
00:11:56.297 --> 00:12:00.244
I'm seeing that I don't really have a clue as to who I am.

283
00:12:00.244 --> 00:12:02.078
And I'm really relieved finally

284
00:12:02.078 --> 00:12:03.774
that I don't have to figure that out.

285
00:12:03.774 --> 00:12:05.374
And not only that, I don't think anyone

286
00:12:05.374 --> 00:12:06.622
has a clue as to who they are.

287
00:12:06.622 --> 00:12:09.022
I think it's charming and adorable that people

288
00:12:09.022 --> 00:12:10.920
think that they know who they are.

289
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.834
(laughter)

290
00:12:11.834 --> 00:12:14.843
I think that's great, but to me, and I'm not judging

291
00:12:14.843 --> 00:12:16.070
anyone's self-concept.

292
00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.353
It's just, the ones that work for me are the ones

293
00:12:18.353 --> 00:12:20.880
that allude to the great mystery and say,

294
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.995
"Look, life is a great mystery and the process of living

295
00:12:23.995 --> 00:12:27.173
"and the process of creation is a great mystery."

296
00:12:27.173 --> 00:12:29.072
We don't have access to the secrets,

297
00:12:29.072 --> 00:12:30.885
the deep secrets of life.

298
00:12:30.885 --> 00:12:32.602
I know that you have a website and all this stuff

299
00:12:32.602 --> 00:12:35.951
that all these incredibly intelligent people are on.

300
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:38.853
And I respect everyone's thoughts

301
00:12:38.853 --> 00:12:40.826
and presence and all that kind of stuff.

302
00:12:40.826 --> 00:12:43.311
So in no way am I saying, am I dissing any of that.

303
00:12:43.311 --> 00:12:45.071
What I am saying though is that,

304
00:12:45.071 --> 00:12:48.303
deep down inside, we're all great mysteries to ourselves.

305
00:12:48.303 --> 00:12:52.345
And once I allow myself to open up to the fact that

306
00:12:52.345 --> 00:12:54.969
I don't have to know who I am, to be.

307
00:12:54.969 --> 00:12:57.774
I don't owe that to the universe, I'm not paying rent here.

308
00:12:57.774 --> 00:13:01.209
I wasn't asked to come here, even though some

309
00:13:01.209 --> 00:13:03.630
philosophies believe that I did ask to come here.

310
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:07.299
My philosophy is that, I woke up one day

311
00:13:07.299 --> 00:13:08.781
and looked around and said, "Oh I'm here."

312
00:13:08.781 --> 00:13:13.080
And I spent five decades trying to figure out why.

313
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.448
And then I finally realized, you know,

314
00:13:15.448 --> 00:13:18.135
I don't have a clue and I'm a pretty smart guy.

315
00:13:18.135 --> 00:13:20.994
So I'm gonna let that all go and I'm going to

316
00:13:20.994 --> 00:13:24.151
allow the process of me to happen.

317
00:13:24.151 --> 00:13:27.799
So I'm a lot more of an observer now in terms

318
00:13:27.799 --> 00:13:30.817
of this funny and unpredictable process

319
00:13:30.817 --> 00:13:33.814
that happens through my vehicle, okay.

320
00:13:33.814 --> 00:13:35.596
So the reason I'm bringing all this up is

321
00:13:35.596 --> 00:13:37.270
because I am talking about creativity

322
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:38.433
when I'm mentioning all of this.

323
00:13:38.433 --> 00:13:42.241
Because creativity is not some coveted secret

324
00:13:42.241 --> 00:13:43.883
that only artists have access to.

325
00:13:43.883 --> 00:13:45.654
And a lot of people believe that.

326
00:13:45.654 --> 00:13:47.883
They believe that, "I'm not creative."

327
00:13:47.883 --> 00:13:49.789
When someone looks at me and says they're not creative,

328
00:13:49.789 --> 00:13:51.272
I look at them and I go, "I don't think you

329
00:13:51.272 --> 00:13:52.893
"understand what creativity is."

330
00:13:52.893 --> 00:13:55.175
<v Voiceover>And so how do you describe to them what it is?</v>

331
00:13:55.175 --> 00:13:57.010
From your perspective?

332
00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:59.261
<v ->I say, "Do you cook, do you do the laundry?</v>

333
00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:01.136
"Do you wake up in the morning and get dressed?

334
00:14:01.136 --> 00:14:02.235
I say, "You're being creative all

335
00:14:02.235 --> 00:14:03.696
"the time, you just don't realize that.

336
00:14:03.696 --> 00:14:05.082
"I mean look at you, you don't look like

337
00:14:05.082 --> 00:14:07.077
"anybody else, you don't dress exactly like

338
00:14:07.077 --> 00:14:08.805
"anybody else, you have a style."

339
00:14:08.805 --> 00:14:11.311
And I kind of go more into that.

340
00:14:11.311 --> 00:14:15.908
Realizing that whether you're creating some...

341
00:14:17.768 --> 00:14:19.944
Let's say artistic thing through an artistic

342
00:14:19.944 --> 00:14:22.450
vehicle in a very specific kind of constricted way.

343
00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.722
Like it's a symphony or a poem or this or that or painting.

344
00:14:24.722 --> 00:14:27.900
You know why is that considered art and someone

345
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.388
whose had recipes handed down for generations

346
00:14:31.388 --> 00:14:34.055
or puts their own twist on it and makes a table full

347
00:14:34.055 --> 00:14:36.497
of people happy every night, why isn't that creative?

348
00:14:36.497 --> 00:14:38.830
I think that's beautiful, and I think that's very creative.

349
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:43.420
So part of it is, for me, opening up the definition

350
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.943
of creativity to say that we are all creative

351
00:14:47.943 --> 00:14:50.780
because we are constantly being created.

352
00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:53.735
And it's just the nature of the universe.

353
00:14:53.735 --> 00:14:57.425
What is creativity? It is life happening.

354
00:14:57.425 --> 00:14:59.675
<v Voiceover>Anything you can conceive of, really.</v>

355
00:14:59.675 --> 00:15:02.342
<v ->It's not even what I can conceive of, it's happening</v>

356
00:15:02.342 --> 00:15:03.569
in spite of what I can conceive of.

357
00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:06.086
It is the life force of all the universe just happening.

358
00:15:06.086 --> 00:15:07.312
It's creation all the time.

359
00:15:07.312 --> 00:15:08.454
<v Voiceover>That's true.</v>

360
00:15:08.454 --> 00:15:10.288
<v ->So in that we are in body, in that we have been</v>

361
00:15:10.288 --> 00:15:14.747
privileged to be in existence, okay.

362
00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.208
Cause I think being here is a privilege.

363
00:15:16.208 --> 00:15:20.250
We are constantly creative because we are being

364
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.063
creative in spite of ourselves.

365
00:15:22.063 --> 00:15:24.005
Even if someone says, "I'm not creative,"

366
00:15:24.005 --> 00:15:26.746
that's pretty creative, that whole act

367
00:15:26.746 --> 00:15:28.417
is a whole creation itself.

368
00:15:29.817 --> 00:15:31.769
But the point being, is that the more we open up

369
00:15:31.769 --> 00:15:36.388
to what creativity is, the more we just allow it.

370
00:15:38.328 --> 00:15:39.289
Can I keep rambling here?--

371
00:15:39.289 --> 00:15:40.516
<v Voiceover>Please do, please do--</v>

372
00:15:40.516 --> 00:15:42.329
<v ->Cause you're inspiring me to think of all these things--</v>

373
00:15:42.329 --> 00:15:43.214
<v Voiceover>Please.</v>

374
00:15:45.484 --> 00:15:47.057
<v ->Some people say, "You know I used to sketch when</v>

375
00:15:47.057 --> 00:15:48.636
"I was young and I don't draw anymore."

376
00:15:48.636 --> 00:15:50.215
Or, "I used to play music, I used to play the piano,

377
00:15:50.215 --> 00:15:51.638
"but I don't do that anymore."

378
00:15:52.718 --> 00:15:55.223
And my thought immediately with that is,

379
00:15:55.223 --> 00:15:57.089
"Are you judging yourself whether

380
00:15:57.089 --> 00:15:58.497
you think it's good or not?"

381
00:15:58.497 --> 00:16:01.292
Cause I think a lot of creativity and that also applies

382
00:16:01.292 --> 00:16:04.236
to say art classes in public schools and tutorials

383
00:16:04.236 --> 00:16:08.481
and however we learn, there's so much

384
00:16:08.481 --> 00:16:10.667
judgement involved from day one.

385
00:16:10.667 --> 00:16:12.427
Is it gonna to be good?

386
00:16:12.427 --> 00:16:14.379
And there to me is the biggest obstacle

387
00:16:14.379 --> 00:16:18.379
for inspiration and creativity is, is it good?

388
00:16:18.379 --> 00:16:19.723
But what does good mean?

389
00:16:19.723 --> 00:16:20.672
And here we go--

390
00:16:20.672 --> 00:16:22.077
<v Voiceover>So highly subjective.</v>

391
00:16:22.077 --> 00:16:25.981
<v ->It's completely subjective, but what it's indicative of</v>

392
00:16:25.981 --> 00:16:27.538
is a culture that's constantly

393
00:16:27.538 --> 00:16:29.714
judging itself and each other.

394
00:16:29.714 --> 00:16:31.111
We're always judging each other and ourselves.

395
00:16:31.111 --> 00:16:33.106
We're always evaluating and everything in the media

396
00:16:33.106 --> 00:16:35.100
is always saying, "This person's beautiful,

397
00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.220
"and that person's not.

398
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.121
"How could Lyle Lovett be with Julia Roberts?"

399
00:16:39.121 --> 00:16:42.074
and silly things like that, where we're all looking

400
00:16:42.074 --> 00:16:44.261
at surface and da-da da-da da, there's all this programming.

401
00:16:44.261 --> 00:16:48.549
Where, in reality everyone's got a unique style

402
00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:50.479
and everyone's got a unique vehicle.

403
00:16:50.479 --> 00:16:52.388
And you give a pen to anybody and say,

404
00:16:52.388 --> 00:16:56.729
"Just draw that flower, just whatever, it's all good."

405
00:16:56.729 --> 00:16:58.543
You know like kids when they're really young

406
00:16:58.543 --> 00:17:01.092
in Kindergarten and stuff, they draw these incredibly

407
00:17:01.092 --> 00:17:05.650
beautiful and naive and pure sketches of things

408
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.136
and they're just beautiful because they're so pure.

409
00:17:08.136 --> 00:17:10.247
Well adults could do that, we can do it.

410
00:17:10.247 --> 00:17:12.754
It doesn't have to look like what we see on TV

411
00:17:12.754 --> 00:17:15.794
or in books or museums, but it's creative.

412
00:17:15.794 --> 00:17:17.724
<v Voiceover>You don't have to show it</v>

413
00:17:17.724 --> 00:17:18.887
to anybody is the point.

414
00:17:18.887 --> 00:17:21.319
<v ->There you go, you don't have to</v>

415
00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:23.521
show it to anybody, you create for yourself.

416
00:17:24.761 --> 00:17:28.447
And that's interesting because now you got me thinking,

417
00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:29.706
"Okay you don't have to show it

418
00:17:29.706 --> 00:17:31.327
"to anybody, but what about ourselves?"

419
00:17:31.327 --> 00:17:32.809
If we allow ourselves to be created,

420
00:17:32.809 --> 00:17:34.623
if I wanna shave my head tomorrow the first thing

421
00:17:34.623 --> 00:17:35.902
I'm going to think of is, "What am I going

422
00:17:35.902 --> 00:17:36.991
"to look like to other people?"

423
00:17:36.991 --> 00:17:39.796
There we go, is it the inner happening,

424
00:17:39.796 --> 00:17:41.236
is it the outer happening?

425
00:17:41.236 --> 00:17:43.380
And of course we're all a combination of that

426
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.975
because we live on this planet.

427
00:17:48.585 --> 00:17:51.365
So for me, I create for myself.

428
00:17:51.365 --> 00:17:55.109
I mean the first thing I do is I'll sit with the piano

429
00:17:55.109 --> 00:17:57.288
or guitar, whatever, the camera.

430
00:17:57.288 --> 00:18:01.045
It's because the act of creation...

431
00:18:02.181 --> 00:18:05.415
Is being in a state, it's the state

432
00:18:05.415 --> 00:18:07.921
of creation that I love, and I'm addicted to it,

433
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:10.502
it is my drug, it's my religion, it's my drug.

434
00:18:10.502 --> 00:18:12.934
Give me a camera, give me a pen, give me this,

435
00:18:12.934 --> 00:18:14.545
give me that and let me create

436
00:18:14.545 --> 00:18:16.699
and I will be as high as I can be

437
00:18:16.699 --> 00:18:19.110
because I will basically just disappear.

438
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.232
<v Voiceover>Then you're removed</v>

439
00:18:21.232 --> 00:18:22.896
from time and space, really.

440
00:18:22.896 --> 00:18:25.339
You're in another continuum entirely.

441
00:18:25.339 --> 00:18:27.941
<v ->Which then you go to being present, right?</v>

442
00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:29.243
So now we're into Eckhart Tolle

443
00:18:29.243 --> 00:18:31.376
and we're into being right here, right now

444
00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:33.189
and we're into timelessness.

445
00:18:33.189 --> 00:18:35.856
And he's one of the few people, I don't read that much,

446
00:18:35.856 --> 00:18:37.733
but he's one of the few people that have

447
00:18:37.733 --> 00:18:39.311
spoken about being out of time.

448
00:18:39.311 --> 00:18:42.127
And being out of time is a beautiful concept.

449
00:18:42.127 --> 00:18:43.610
I love being out of time.

450
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.138
I talk to other people, my friends about it and things.

451
00:18:46.138 --> 00:18:48.337
They don't quite understand what that means.

452
00:18:49.747 --> 00:18:51.272
<v Voiceover>Would you describe it as that thing,</v>

453
00:18:51.272 --> 00:18:53.224
well where time stands still?

454
00:18:53.224 --> 00:18:56.082
Where you're involved in, you wake up, you come back

455
00:18:56.082 --> 00:18:58.823
to your third dimensional thinking when you're done

456
00:18:58.823 --> 00:19:00.914
with your creation in that moment and maybe

457
00:19:00.914 --> 00:19:02.514
hours have passed, maybe it's night time,

458
00:19:02.514 --> 00:19:03.719
maybe it's midnight already.

459
00:19:03.719 --> 00:19:06.481
Is it that thing that makes time stand still literally?

460
00:19:06.481 --> 00:19:07.623
<v ->The being present thing?</v>

461
00:19:07.623 --> 00:19:09.700
Well yeah, but here's the deal.

462
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.724
People ask me, "Do you meditate?"

463
00:19:12.724 --> 00:19:15.196
And I say, "Well, yes, but maybe

464
00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:16.774
"not in the conventional sense.

465
00:19:16.774 --> 00:19:19.561
"I don't empty out my mind, I empty out my being

466
00:19:19.561 --> 00:19:21.374
"and it fills up with lots of cool stuff

467
00:19:21.374 --> 00:19:25.491
"and either I'm in an active total presence

468
00:19:25.491 --> 00:19:27.507
"or I'm creating, it's the same thing."

469
00:19:27.507 --> 00:19:31.315
I think creating and being present are the same thing.

470
00:19:31.315 --> 00:19:34.312
Being in the moment and being creative are the same thing.

471
00:19:34.312 --> 00:19:38.856
It is the lifting of the limitation of any sort of

472
00:19:38.856 --> 00:19:41.906
ego identity or an obligation to have to be

473
00:19:41.906 --> 00:19:45.426
a certain thing, to allow whatever process,

474
00:19:45.426 --> 00:19:49.191
unlimited, that wants to come through, to be.

475
00:19:49.191 --> 00:19:51.719
So yes, timelessness absolutely.

476
00:19:51.719 --> 00:19:54.791
Because if we're in time, we're marking things.

477
00:19:54.791 --> 00:19:56.508
<v Voiceover>Yes and that's one of the things</v>

478
00:19:56.508 --> 00:19:58.545
many times when I meet somebody.

479
00:19:58.545 --> 00:20:01.894
If I'm at some gathering and I'm meeting new people,

480
00:20:01.894 --> 00:20:04.166
and want to get to know them, that's usually

481
00:20:04.166 --> 00:20:06.790
the first question I ask them, is, "What is it that

482
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.275
"makes time stand still for you?"

483
00:20:09.275 --> 00:20:11.366
Cause that's the only thing I can think of that

484
00:20:11.366 --> 00:20:13.392
would really get to the heart of who they are.

485
00:20:13.392 --> 00:20:14.757
<v ->Has anybody told you good sex?</v>

486
00:20:14.757 --> 00:20:18.491
<v Voiceover>Yes actually they have, people have said that.</v>

487
00:20:18.491 --> 00:20:19.536
<v ->That is one of the primary--</v>

488
00:20:19.536 --> 00:20:21.424
<v Voiceover>Because that is one of the things probably</v>

489
00:20:21.424 --> 00:20:24.658
more than any other thing, especially males (laughs)

490
00:20:24.658 --> 00:20:27.531
more than women, but yes they have said sex.

491
00:20:27.531 --> 00:20:31.702
And it's interesting because that's tapping into

492
00:20:31.702 --> 00:20:34.539
the essence of a being, to me.

493
00:20:34.539 --> 00:20:36.981
But it's also surprising how many people

494
00:20:36.981 --> 00:20:38.837
have never had the conscious

495
00:20:38.837 --> 00:20:40.992
experience of having time stand still.

496
00:20:40.992 --> 00:20:44.476
Because they're on a wheel of duty,

497
00:20:44.476 --> 00:20:49.062
tasks, fulfilling whatever the driving mission is

498
00:20:49.062 --> 00:20:51.099
of their day or of their life.

499
00:20:51.099 --> 00:20:54.672
And you have never really succumb to that.

500
00:20:54.672 --> 00:20:58.320
In fact, you told me once off camera that you

501
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.987
would die if you had to go through a day without creating.

502
00:21:00.987 --> 00:21:02.405
It would kill your life force.

503
00:21:02.405 --> 00:21:04.602
It wouldn't make any sense to me,

504
00:21:04.602 --> 00:21:06.042
I would have to go inward and create

505
00:21:06.042 --> 00:21:08.314
in my own mind anyway, it just can't happen anymore.

506
00:21:08.314 --> 00:21:11.493
It's like breathing to me, I literally feel smothered

507
00:21:11.493 --> 00:21:14.810
if I can't somehow create in any moment.

508
00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:16.676
I mean, let's put it this way.

509
00:21:16.676 --> 00:21:18.634
This might sound a little condescending,

510
00:21:18.634 --> 00:21:21.812
but when I'm in the presence in an un-engaging conversation

511
00:21:21.812 --> 00:21:24.319
I'm carrying on a completely different creative dialogue

512
00:21:24.319 --> 00:21:27.220
with myself or I'm abstracting what I'm looking at

513
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.852
and create art off someone's face

514
00:21:28.852 --> 00:21:30.313
or their features or whatever it is.

515
00:21:30.313 --> 00:21:32.862
Because i refuse to be held down

516
00:21:32.862 --> 00:21:35.678
into a state that's degrading to my spirit.

517
00:21:35.678 --> 00:21:37.950
Which means I don't want to be

518
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.158
somewhere where I don't feel engaged.

519
00:21:40.158 --> 00:21:41.598
And it happens, sometimes we're obliged

520
00:21:41.598 --> 00:21:42.899
to do certain things.

521
00:21:42.899 --> 00:21:45.011
However, I do have a sub-text going on

522
00:21:45.011 --> 00:21:47.720
that allows me to be entertained in the meantime.

523
00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.856
<v Voiceover>(laughs) Nice being in your head (laughs).</v>

524
00:21:50.856 --> 00:21:53.245
It's your experience of creativity, I understand,

525
00:21:53.245 --> 00:21:55.314
it's totally consistent with everything you've said.

526
00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:58.887
So, have you ever been in a situation in life

527
00:21:58.887 --> 00:22:01.073
say when you were in school for example,

528
00:22:01.073 --> 00:22:03.270
where boundaries were created?

529
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.218
Have there been situations in life

530
00:22:05.218 --> 00:22:09.373
where you have been bounded, bound?

531
00:22:09.373 --> 00:22:11.741
<v ->God yes, I mean come on look at this planet.</v>

532
00:22:11.741 --> 00:22:14.343
<v Voiceover>Right, exactly. So then what happens?</v>

533
00:22:14.343 --> 00:22:15.553
What happens?

534
00:22:16.523 --> 00:22:18.589
<v ->I usually get out of those relationships (laughs).</v>

535
00:22:18.589 --> 00:22:20.701
<v Voiceover>Okay so, relationships number one.</v>

536
00:22:20.701 --> 00:22:22.621
Before that there was school.

537
00:22:22.621 --> 00:22:26.151
<v ->You know I don't have children that I know of,</v>

538
00:22:26.151 --> 00:22:29.874
but if I were to do that I would be really careful

539
00:22:29.874 --> 00:22:31.282
about putting them in a public school.

540
00:22:31.282 --> 00:22:33.600
At least a conventional public school.

541
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.872
Because, why would I want my unbounded being

542
00:22:37.872 --> 00:22:40.891
offspring to be programmed to conventional thinking?

543
00:22:40.891 --> 00:22:44.091
And I'm not saying that public school is bad or wrong,

544
00:22:44.091 --> 00:22:46.085
it's a necessary thing and I'm sure there's some

545
00:22:46.085 --> 00:22:48.762
great teachers in public schools systems.

546
00:22:48.762 --> 00:22:50.735
And some great systems within public schools

547
00:22:50.735 --> 00:22:52.378
that are working to inspire children.

548
00:22:52.378 --> 00:22:54.031
It has to be, otherwise we would just have

549
00:22:54.031 --> 00:22:57.188
an entire culture of robots, blind people.

550
00:22:59.918 --> 00:23:02.413
I think that, you know if I were to have children

551
00:23:02.413 --> 00:23:05.453
I would constantly be looking at

552
00:23:05.453 --> 00:23:08.077
what is their nature and how can I nurture their nature?

553
00:23:08.077 --> 00:23:10.327
And here to me is...

554
00:23:11.547 --> 00:23:12.819
I go back to the whole meaning of life thing

555
00:23:12.819 --> 00:23:13.919
that I started with and I think...

556
00:23:16.352 --> 00:23:18.935
If there's a meaning to this life, for me,

557
00:23:18.935 --> 00:23:20.162
and I'll just say specific to me.

558
00:23:20.162 --> 00:23:21.538
Cause I'm the only one who can really

559
00:23:21.538 --> 00:23:22.903
say that for myself.

560
00:23:22.903 --> 00:23:26.135
I would say is to live within my nature.

561
00:23:26.135 --> 00:23:28.642
To live authentically, okay.

562
00:23:28.642 --> 00:23:32.055
To allow what is natural for me, to come through.

563
00:23:32.055 --> 00:23:36.001
So not only does that create a being that

564
00:23:36.001 --> 00:23:37.510
I think is more balanced and more at peace

565
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:40.198
with himself, which I'm more and more that.

566
00:23:40.198 --> 00:23:42.331
More and more I say because I'm also neurotic

567
00:23:42.331 --> 00:23:44.331
and all the other things that people are.

568
00:23:44.331 --> 00:23:49.277
But I think it also maintains a fairly high level of energy.

569
00:23:49.277 --> 00:23:52.018
So I go back that meditation comment

570
00:23:52.018 --> 00:23:55.354
and I'm thinking okay this, timeless thing

571
00:23:55.354 --> 00:23:56.772
that you were mentioning, this timeless

572
00:23:56.772 --> 00:23:58.923
thing we're talking about, I think

573
00:23:58.924 --> 00:24:00.388
it's training, I think the more that I

574
00:24:00.388 --> 00:24:02.841
engage in timelessness, the more it becomes

575
00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:04.910
more of the critical mass of my life.

576
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.648
The more that i'm engaged in being engaged,

577
00:24:06.648 --> 00:24:10.179
the more I refuse to accept not being engaged.

578
00:24:10.179 --> 00:24:11.619
<v Voiceover>It makes sense, you're creating a</v>

579
00:24:11.619 --> 00:24:14.477
resonance field charged toward that, that very thing.

580
00:24:14.477 --> 00:24:18.008
<v ->And I think that life is very simple in this sense.</v>

581
00:24:18.008 --> 00:24:20.216
I think that all living beings

582
00:24:20.216 --> 00:24:22.605
are in a state of pain avoidance.

583
00:24:22.605 --> 00:24:25.069
If there's anything that I can see that motivates life,

584
00:24:25.069 --> 00:24:27.266
all life doesn't want to be in pain.

585
00:24:27.266 --> 00:24:28.802
I don't know any life, except maybe some

586
00:24:28.802 --> 00:24:30.540
twisted individuals that enjoy that.

587
00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.889
Actually maybe not twisted, maybe they just

588
00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:35.959
enjoy that, okay, see, checking.

589
00:24:37.229 --> 00:24:41.378
But most beings that I watch, right down from the very first

590
00:24:41.378 --> 00:24:45.004
one-celled amoeba that I saw as a kid in biology class.

591
00:24:45.004 --> 00:24:46.188
And it was interesting,

592
00:24:46.188 --> 00:24:48.556
this very simple lesson was fantastic.

593
00:24:48.556 --> 00:24:50.113
Teacher said, "Okay, here's an amoeba."

594
00:24:50.113 --> 00:24:51.382
And we're watching this little thing do this thing.

595
00:24:51.382 --> 00:24:53.505
He's like, "Put some little food," and they give you

596
00:24:53.505 --> 00:24:55.638
some little something, some little grain of something.

597
00:24:55.638 --> 00:24:58.678
"And watch the amoeba wrap around this food thing."

598
00:24:58.678 --> 00:25:00.438
So we watch the amoeba wrap around.

599
00:25:00.438 --> 00:25:02.048
Said, "Now we're gonna put something the amoeba

600
00:25:02.048 --> 00:25:03.350
"doesn't like, we're gonna put it right next to it."

601
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.205
And all of a sudden you see it move away.

602
00:25:05.205 --> 00:25:07.008
Now that taught me more about life than

603
00:25:07.008 --> 00:25:09.429
pretty much any simple lesson, ever.

604
00:25:09.429 --> 00:25:11.445
That's all we do.

605
00:25:11.445 --> 00:25:13.536
We wrap around things that make us feel good

606
00:25:13.536 --> 00:25:16.277
and we recede from things that don't.

607
00:25:16.277 --> 00:25:17.621
Okay, it's that simple.

608
00:25:17.621 --> 00:25:19.925
<v Voiceover>That's what we inherently do.</v>

609
00:25:19.925 --> 00:25:23.374
That's our instinct, but our instincts are often

610
00:25:23.374 --> 00:25:28.374
overridden by various dogma and expectations and so forth.

611
00:25:28.478 --> 00:25:32.542
And that's where you get into institutionalized thinking

612
00:25:32.542 --> 00:25:36.637
or you get into almost like mass brainwashing.

613
00:25:36.637 --> 00:25:40.445
Because one thing for sure, is as we know life right now,

614
00:25:40.445 --> 00:25:43.112
which is why I wanted to talk to you about this so badly.

615
00:25:43.112 --> 00:25:47.271
Every day, as each day passes, I see how the creativity

616
00:25:47.271 --> 00:25:51.335
has been stamped out of the cultures on this planet.

617
00:25:51.335 --> 00:25:56.156
Working more and more toward a worker bee society.

618
00:25:56.156 --> 00:25:59.687
Even recent comments by Obama about the

619
00:25:59.687 --> 00:26:01.479
priorities in the educational system,

620
00:26:01.479 --> 00:26:03.153
"We have to compete with China

621
00:26:03.153 --> 00:26:04.796
"and we have to compete with India.

622
00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:06.886
"We need more science, we need more math."

623
00:26:06.886 --> 00:26:07.910
Oh boy!

624
00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:11.782
When I heard that it was just so depressing to me.

625
00:26:11.782 --> 00:26:14.736
After No Child Left Behind how much worse could it get

626
00:26:14.736 --> 00:26:17.843
than only educating to the next test?

627
00:26:17.843 --> 00:26:21.320
So this is being systematically eroded.

628
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.925
And the parents, you know two parents are working.

629
00:26:24.925 --> 00:26:26.685
They don't have time to really,

630
00:26:26.685 --> 00:26:28.755
like your mother fostered it with you.

631
00:26:28.755 --> 00:26:30.888
Parents aren't taking the time to foster it.

632
00:26:30.888 --> 00:26:33.074
And really, isn't it a value, I mean

633
00:26:33.074 --> 00:26:34.791
this is part, of a value system?

634
00:26:34.791 --> 00:26:36.530
We've got a screwed up value system.

635
00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:38.855
We're not valuing creativity.

636
00:26:38.855 --> 00:26:40.967
<v ->No and actually I think it started</v>

637
00:26:40.967 --> 00:26:42.738
in the Reagan Administration.

638
00:26:42.738 --> 00:26:44.498
When they started cutting back on

639
00:26:44.498 --> 00:26:46.001
National Endowment for the Arts,

640
00:26:46.001 --> 00:26:48.540
was the first time I heard of a major cutback of,

641
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.460
National Endowment for the Arts that was in jeopardy.

642
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.412
And then there were programs in schools.

643
00:26:52.412 --> 00:26:54.108
Cause he was the guy who cleaned up all the budgets

644
00:26:54.108 --> 00:26:57.126
everywhere because we were in such havoc economically.

645
00:26:57.126 --> 00:27:00.145
But what he cut back, this is where culturally

646
00:27:00.145 --> 00:27:02.630
in this country, I think was a big step backwards.

647
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:03.675
<v Voiceover>I agree.</v>

648
00:27:07.645 --> 00:27:09.347
<v ->I'm shocked because I talk to my nephews.</v>

649
00:27:09.347 --> 00:27:11.182
I have two teenage nephews.

650
00:27:11.182 --> 00:27:13.528
And I talk to my ex-girlfriend's children,

651
00:27:13.528 --> 00:27:15.171
who I'm still in touch with.

652
00:27:15.171 --> 00:27:18.915
And they tell me they only have recess twice a week now.

653
00:27:18.915 --> 00:27:22.253
I asked them about what they call Phi-Ed in my days.

654
00:27:22.253 --> 00:27:23.181
I don't know what they call it now,

655
00:27:23.181 --> 00:27:24.322
gym, whatever you wanna call it.

656
00:27:24.322 --> 00:27:27.383
Yeah, they only have that a couple days a week.

657
00:27:28.693 --> 00:27:30.774
And art and music once a week.

658
00:27:30.774 --> 00:27:32.406
Now we had it every day.

659
00:27:32.406 --> 00:27:35.531
We had one hour of art and music every single day.

660
00:27:35.531 --> 00:27:37.872
And that was...

661
00:27:42.059 --> 00:27:44.122
In my book, that would be minimal.

662
00:27:44.122 --> 00:27:45.658
A couple hours of creativity a day

663
00:27:45.658 --> 00:27:47.279
would be minimal for kids.

664
00:27:47.279 --> 00:27:49.369
That's why I would do a whole different thing.

665
00:27:49.369 --> 00:27:51.652
I mean there's hope in public and private school systems--

666
00:27:51.652 --> 00:27:52.761
<v Voiceover>The Waldorf system</v>

667
00:27:52.761 --> 00:27:54.159
is pretty fabulous that way.

668
00:27:54.159 --> 00:27:55.780
<v ->Yeah there's all that, but you're right,</v>

669
00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.966
what you're thinking of culturally, I'm going, "Wow."

670
00:27:57.966 --> 00:28:00.419
Yeah it's happening in that direction,

671
00:28:00.419 --> 00:28:04.417
however, you know, art somehow prevails.

672
00:28:04.417 --> 00:28:07.223
It's strange you can have a huge system

673
00:28:07.223 --> 00:28:10.337
that's very oppressive and somehow squeezing out

674
00:28:10.337 --> 00:28:13.057
between the cracks will be intense art.

675
00:28:13.057 --> 00:28:14.358
<v Voiceover>Well that would be YouTube.</v>

676
00:28:14.358 --> 00:28:16.001
A lot of what you'd see on YouTube for example.

677
00:28:16.001 --> 00:28:19.979
Where everybody can afford a $100 flip camera, you know?

678
00:28:19.979 --> 00:28:22.646
<v ->Right and also, look at historically.</v>

679
00:28:22.646 --> 00:28:25.248
Let's say in the 80's when the punk movement came out.

680
00:28:25.248 --> 00:28:28.213
Busting out of a lot of convention.

681
00:28:28.213 --> 00:28:31.445
The last huge burst we saw in creativity

682
00:28:31.445 --> 00:28:33.440
was 60's into the 70's.

683
00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.042
The freedom, love, music, was incredible.

684
00:28:36.042 --> 00:28:38.293
Art, dance, poetry, I mean there

685
00:28:38.293 --> 00:28:40.031
was so much going on in that era.

686
00:28:40.031 --> 00:28:42.004
And then it all just kind of all sunk into disco

687
00:28:42.004 --> 00:28:45.769
and fashion and all this other stuff and vanity.

688
00:28:45.769 --> 00:28:49.535
And then little things would burst here and there.

689
00:28:49.535 --> 00:28:53.758
I think right now I'm not personally seeing

690
00:28:53.758 --> 00:28:57.545
a lot of huge leaps in creativity culturally.

691
00:28:57.545 --> 00:28:59.049
I don't know where it is.

692
00:28:59.049 --> 00:29:01.374
I mean our culture looks at the music

693
00:29:01.374 --> 00:29:03.816
world now as like American Idol.

694
00:29:03.816 --> 00:29:07.901
That is the beacon, the icon of what's going

695
00:29:07.901 --> 00:29:09.971
on in the music world right now.

696
00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:14.815
Certainly there is an amount of creativity there,

697
00:29:14.815 --> 00:29:18.092
but the fact that the public votes on it, think about that.

698
00:29:18.092 --> 00:29:20.182
What that means is, the greatest common

699
00:29:20.182 --> 00:29:23.158
denominator determines what good art is.

700
00:29:23.158 --> 00:29:24.385
And I think--

701
00:29:24.385 --> 00:29:26.667
<v Voiceover>Now that's a pretty big</v>

702
00:29:26.667 --> 00:29:28.779
signal to the mass psyche.

703
00:29:28.779 --> 00:29:31.125
<v ->Right, okay, but I think that's</v>

704
00:29:31.125 --> 00:29:35.211
commercialism of creativity is the same thing.

705
00:29:35.211 --> 00:29:38.170
The artists that are respected...

706
00:29:38.997 --> 00:29:42.218
in the conventional world, not so much in the art world,

707
00:29:42.218 --> 00:29:44.213
are the ones who sell the most, right?

708
00:29:44.213 --> 00:29:46.047
That's kind of how it works.

709
00:29:46.047 --> 00:29:48.212
Sort of there's a capitalism of creativity

710
00:29:48.212 --> 00:29:50.719
that's been going on for quite a long time.

711
00:29:50.719 --> 00:29:53.716
Of course it goes back to I'm sure the times that there were

712
00:29:53.716 --> 00:29:55.497
patrons of the arts and the Kings and the Queens.

713
00:29:55.497 --> 00:29:58.036
Because they would pay the artist to do this, this and this.

714
00:29:58.036 --> 00:30:01.353
So these were the pop artists of their times.

715
00:30:01.353 --> 00:30:03.251
So it's been going on, money and art

716
00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:05.673
have been friends for a long time.

717
00:30:05.673 --> 00:30:09.800
But these days, I don't see any radical movements

718
00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:14.259
in creativity in music, in art, that as a public consumer

719
00:30:14.259 --> 00:30:18.088
person in the conventional world, that I'm in touch with.

720
00:30:18.088 --> 00:30:20.850
I'm not a teenager on YouTube looking at

721
00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:22.578
all this fringe stuff, which is awesome.

722
00:30:22.578 --> 00:30:24.658
<v Voiceover>Very democratic.</v>

723
00:30:24.658 --> 00:30:26.781
<v ->Boundless, completely democratic</v>

724
00:30:26.781 --> 00:30:27.826
because no one's voting on it.

725
00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:29.940
Even though they have the votes and all that.

726
00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.052
But right now, your points really well taken.

727
00:30:34.052 --> 00:30:36.836
How are we going to save this world?

728
00:30:36.836 --> 00:30:38.532
How are we gonna save this world?

729
00:30:38.532 --> 00:30:40.441
How are we gonna get back in touch

730
00:30:40.441 --> 00:30:42.851
with living an authentic life?

731
00:30:42.851 --> 00:30:43.861
I mean that's really the whole the whole--

732
00:30:43.861 --> 00:30:44.968
<v Voiceover>The juice of life--</v>

733
00:30:44.968 --> 00:30:45.476
<v ->That's really the whole core here</v>

734
00:30:45.476 --> 00:30:46.713
we're talking about right?

735
00:30:46.713 --> 00:30:49.519
Is getting into our core and giving

736
00:30:49.519 --> 00:30:51.566
ourselves permission to be.

737
00:30:51.566 --> 00:30:53.070
That's really what it is.

738
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:55.534
And not constantly looking at it as if it's okay with them.

739
00:30:55.534 --> 00:30:57.134
It's really right here.

740
00:30:58.314 --> 00:31:03.112
As far as cultural movements, we're all in the fringe now,

741
00:31:03.112 --> 00:31:06.152
it's the fringe people doing that.

742
00:31:08.312 --> 00:31:09.874
Personally, all I can say is this.

743
00:31:09.874 --> 00:31:13.895
In my life I can only change the world by changing

744
00:31:13.895 --> 00:31:15.954
my world, that's where it starts.

745
00:31:15.954 --> 00:31:17.234
I can only change my world by

746
00:31:17.234 --> 00:31:19.278
allowing myself to be who I am.

747
00:31:20.728 --> 00:31:23.034
Naturally I like sharing my creations with people.

748
00:31:23.034 --> 00:31:24.070
Though I'd have to say...

749
00:31:24.865 --> 00:31:28.140
I would say 95% of what I create no one ever sees but me.

750
00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.516
<v Voiceover>No one ever hears but you.</v>

751
00:31:29.516 --> 00:31:32.043
<v ->No one ever hears, sees, whatever, feels.</v>

752
00:31:33.783 --> 00:31:36.320
But I do like to share with people because it is,

753
00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.571
what I'd said earlier it's what The Beatles

754
00:31:38.571 --> 00:31:40.939
did for me, I see happening with my music.

755
00:31:40.939 --> 00:31:45.060
I just create because I tune into whatever that

756
00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.460
inspirational level of energy is.

757
00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.798
Something comes through and it creates something.

758
00:31:50.798 --> 00:31:55.161
Which within which is encoded a vibration.

759
00:31:55.161 --> 00:31:57.976
Like I said, I believe inspiration

760
00:31:57.976 --> 00:31:59.203
has a very high vibration.

761
00:31:59.203 --> 00:32:00.856
<v Voiceover>And your music has a wonderful purity to it.</v>

762
00:32:00.856 --> 00:32:03.704
For me it has a very high frequency.

763
00:32:03.704 --> 00:32:06.002
<v ->So that must be what comes through me</v>

764
00:32:06.002 --> 00:32:10.088
to put into some form, to encode so people can

765
00:32:10.088 --> 00:32:12.083
decode it into their own experience.

766
00:32:13.583 --> 00:32:17.640
So all I can do is do what I do, not judge what I do.

767
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.830
I do edit and choose what to share with people.

768
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:25.032
So I can share that and at times in my life

769
00:32:25.032 --> 00:32:26.807
that has had somewhat of a...

770
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.576
The emanations have been felt worldwide

771
00:32:29.576 --> 00:32:31.176
to whatever extent.

772
00:32:31.176 --> 00:32:32.647
<v Voiceover>Oh yeah, you've had some good numbers.</v>

773
00:32:32.647 --> 00:32:34.109
You've made a living at it for a lot of years

774
00:32:34.109 --> 00:32:34.758
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

775
00:32:34.758 --> 00:32:35.413
<v Voiceover>And I want to talk to</v>

776
00:32:35.413 --> 00:32:36.070
you about that in a minute too.

777
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.730
<v ->Okay, and so what I'm saying is it all starts right here.</v>

778
00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:42.815
Change my world, create within my world, accept myself

779
00:32:42.815 --> 00:32:44.905
and whoever I'm meant to touch,

780
00:32:44.905 --> 00:32:47.529
in whatever ways is me changing the world.

781
00:32:47.529 --> 00:32:50.626
I don't work through political systems, it's not my style.

782
00:32:52.066 --> 00:32:53.517
It's for someone else to do.

783
00:32:53.517 --> 00:32:57.656
But I think as individuals if we learn to accept

784
00:32:57.656 --> 00:33:00.120
ourselves, it's such a powerful message.

785
00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.645
I don't know anyone on this planet that

786
00:33:01.645 --> 00:33:04.247
doesn't want to accept themselves.

787
00:33:04.247 --> 00:33:06.061
<v Voiceover>That's true, that doesn't want</v>

788
00:33:06.061 --> 00:33:07.757
to not feel uncomfortable in their

789
00:33:07.757 --> 00:33:09.538
own skin and in their own lives.

790
00:33:09.538 --> 00:33:11.511
<v ->Right, that's huge pain for everybody.</v>

791
00:33:11.511 --> 00:33:13.324
I know it, I've lived it, plenty of it.

792
00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:15.020
Don't get the impression that I've always been

793
00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.036
happy and confident and always accepting myself.

794
00:33:17.036 --> 00:33:21.188
No, no, there are phases in early life, in my adult life,

795
00:33:21.188 --> 00:33:22.628
where I go through another notch where

796
00:33:22.628 --> 00:33:25.923
I'm facing my own self judgement and whatever it is.

797
00:33:25.923 --> 00:33:28.942
And because it's so painful to live in that state,

798
00:33:28.942 --> 00:33:30.478
I have to work really hard to get out of it.

799
00:33:30.478 --> 00:33:32.728
So I do because I refuse to stay there.

800
00:33:32.728 --> 00:33:34.723
And then there's a relief and then there's

801
00:33:34.723 --> 00:33:36.749
like a new level of expression.

802
00:33:36.749 --> 00:33:39.373
And then out of that comes the creativity.

803
00:33:39.373 --> 00:33:42.274
There've been times in my life where I've been

804
00:33:42.274 --> 00:33:44.312
through such a deep inner process that it's not

805
00:33:44.312 --> 00:33:46.797
important for me to create outwardly.

806
00:33:47.907 --> 00:33:49.545
And I think a lot of artists go through this and that.

807
00:33:49.545 --> 00:33:51.848
It's just like ebbs and flows and that's

808
00:33:51.848 --> 00:33:53.395
the way the universe works, it breathes.

809
00:33:53.395 --> 00:33:55.880
So we go through our winters sometimes.

810
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.365
And we have our winter, I think that's as important

811
00:33:58.365 --> 00:34:01.165
as part of the creative process, is being totally

812
00:34:01.165 --> 00:34:03.444
in flow and being just crazy prolific.

813
00:34:03.444 --> 00:34:04.489
<v Voiceover>It's the flow of nature,</v>

814
00:34:04.489 --> 00:34:05.833
the cycles of life, absolutely.

815
00:34:05.833 --> 00:34:08.137
Where you have that gestation going deep inside

816
00:34:08.137 --> 00:34:10.846
into the darkness of the earth and fertile soil

817
00:34:10.846 --> 00:34:13.960
and then boom, you know spring comes, new blossoms.

818
00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.960
But you've had to interface with the commercial world too.

819
00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.464
And this is just something as a musician,

820
00:34:19.464 --> 00:34:21.653
I'd like to hear from you as your perspective.

821
00:34:23.073 --> 00:34:26.033
A lot of people in the recording industry

822
00:34:26.033 --> 00:34:27.964
are really having a hard time right now.

823
00:34:27.964 --> 00:34:30.684
It's because of what's happened with the

824
00:34:30.684 --> 00:34:33.116
digitization and everything of the files.

825
00:34:33.116 --> 00:34:36.763
Versus the way of first buying vinyl and then tapes

826
00:34:36.763 --> 00:34:39.110
and then CD's and now you go to

827
00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.987
basically iTunes for everything.

828
00:34:40.987 --> 00:34:42.779
What has happened and how are we

829
00:34:42.779 --> 00:34:46.331
going to support artists in the future?

830
00:34:46.331 --> 00:34:50.256
<v ->Wow, that kinda hits home because</v>

831
00:34:50.256 --> 00:34:54.576
I was raised in an era where music

832
00:34:54.576 --> 00:34:57.573
and selling records and all that, was huge.

833
00:34:57.573 --> 00:35:00.933
I mean the 60's into the 70's were huge with music.

834
00:35:02.903 --> 00:35:06.905
Selling records was a deal up until maybe 10 years ago.

835
00:35:06.905 --> 00:35:08.643
The paradigm's completely changed

836
00:35:08.643 --> 00:35:09.590
and I have to say i'm a little off

837
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.147
balance right now with it all.

838
00:35:11.147 --> 00:35:14.699
Because there are ways of adapting where of course you

839
00:35:14.699 --> 00:35:17.259
put download sites up and you do that sort of thing.

840
00:35:17.259 --> 00:35:19.253
Which is what I'm doing a lot later than most people

841
00:35:19.253 --> 00:35:21.152
because I'm stubborn and I like the

842
00:35:21.152 --> 00:35:23.317
romance of having a piece of something.

843
00:35:23.317 --> 00:35:25.408
When I create something or when it's created

844
00:35:25.408 --> 00:35:27.754
through me I guess is the accurate way for me to say it.

845
00:35:28.954 --> 00:35:32.587
But I do work very hard and I spend a lot of time

846
00:35:32.587 --> 00:35:36.867
and energy in my studio working and I create these things.

847
00:35:36.867 --> 00:35:39.555
Well now these things are invisible.

848
00:35:39.555 --> 00:35:41.923
They're just things that go on the internet

849
00:35:41.923 --> 00:35:43.113
and in 10 seconds you can download one

850
00:35:43.113 --> 00:35:45.172
of my songs that took me an entire month

851
00:35:45.172 --> 00:35:47.934
to create, it's not very romantic.

852
00:35:47.934 --> 00:35:49.939
<v Voiceover>No it's not very romantic but it's the way.</v>

853
00:35:49.939 --> 00:35:52.563
It's also not very as profitable.

854
00:35:52.563 --> 00:35:55.411
<v ->Well here's the deal and here's where</v>

855
00:35:55.411 --> 00:35:58.291
I have to let the world be the world.

856
00:35:58.291 --> 00:36:00.008
And I try not to judge it too much.

857
00:36:00.008 --> 00:36:02.515
Because it could really piss me off right now

858
00:36:02.515 --> 00:36:04.445
and it has in the past.

859
00:36:04.445 --> 00:36:06.578
Realizing that for some reason,

860
00:36:06.578 --> 00:36:10.162
the common belief now is that music is free.

861
00:36:10.162 --> 00:36:12.039
<v Voiceover>Well, okay, first of all--</v>

862
00:36:12.039 --> 00:36:12.754
<v ->The common belief--</v>

863
00:36:12.754 --> 00:36:14.077
<v Voiceover>It's going through the internet</v>

864
00:36:14.077 --> 00:36:15.964
to access it and anything on the internet should be free.

865
00:36:15.964 --> 00:36:17.938
It's a larger belief system.

866
00:36:17.938 --> 00:36:19.260
<v ->Okay, there you go, there's the whole system.</v>

867
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:22.001
And art's becoming that way and movies have become that way.

868
00:36:22.001 --> 00:36:23.527
I mean so much, whatever you can see

869
00:36:23.527 --> 00:36:26.150
on the internet, somehow you can get for free.

870
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:28.572
Whether you go through LimeWire or whatever you do.

871
00:36:28.572 --> 00:36:30.822
Or just drag a piece of art off the internet

872
00:36:30.822 --> 00:36:32.913
and print it up, whatever it is.

873
00:36:32.913 --> 00:36:36.305
It's the value of art that has changed so much.

874
00:36:36.305 --> 00:36:38.395
<v Voiceover>The public, the consuming</v>

875
00:36:38.395 --> 00:36:39.488
public has devalued it.

876
00:36:39.488 --> 00:36:41.976
<v ->The general consuming public, yes.</v>

877
00:36:41.976 --> 00:36:45.346
Now looks at what I do as something that is

878
00:36:45.346 --> 00:36:48.115
much cheaper with less value than it used to be.

879
00:36:50.285 --> 00:36:52.126
Like I said, I could take an entire month

880
00:36:52.126 --> 00:36:55.080
of my blood, sweat and tears and squeeze my soul

881
00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.512
to create a song and someone can download

882
00:36:57.512 --> 00:37:00.136
it off of LimeWire for free in 15 seconds.

883
00:37:02.506 --> 00:37:04.367
I don't think that's a bad person whose doing that.

884
00:37:04.367 --> 00:37:07.855
I think it's just a different value system that's happening.

885
00:37:07.855 --> 00:37:09.295
<v Voiceover>We haven't stopped to think</v>

886
00:37:09.295 --> 00:37:12.100
about the net effect of that in the end--

887
00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.269
<v ->The cause and effect, going back, reciprocity.</v>

888
00:37:15.269 --> 00:37:18.661
Here's a culture that has lost its sense of reciprocity.

889
00:37:18.661 --> 00:37:20.869
For quite a while I would have to say.

890
00:37:22.199 --> 00:37:24.619
But there are great exceptions to that.

891
00:37:24.619 --> 00:37:26.688
We just had an earthquake in Haiti and look at

892
00:37:26.688 --> 00:37:28.587
all the generosity and people's hearts that have poured out.

893
00:37:28.587 --> 00:37:30.304
It's very touching, very beautiful.

894
00:37:30.304 --> 00:37:33.066
Katrina was the same way, on and on and on.

895
00:37:33.066 --> 00:37:34.346
<v Voiceover>We respond to crises.</v>

896
00:37:34.346 --> 00:37:36.479
<v ->We respond to crisis, but as far as artists go</v>

897
00:37:36.479 --> 00:37:38.410
and I'll just speak for myself.

898
00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:40.842
We work really hard, we also have bills to pay.

899
00:37:40.842 --> 00:37:43.754
People are assuming that artists, if they have a certain

900
00:37:43.754 --> 00:37:45.462
amount of notoriety, are already automatically

901
00:37:45.462 --> 00:37:47.467
going to be really wealthy and don't need the money.

902
00:37:47.467 --> 00:37:48.752
Well that's not really true at all.

903
00:37:48.752 --> 00:37:50.585
And I'll speak for any artist on the planet

904
00:37:50.585 --> 00:37:52.388
because no matter how wealthy they are,

905
00:37:52.388 --> 00:37:54.041
they deserve it, they worked really hard.

906
00:37:54.041 --> 00:37:56.334
I don't know any great artist who is,

907
00:37:56.334 --> 00:37:57.710
and I'll just speak for musicians I guess.

908
00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:00.376
Any great pop star who hasn't worked blood,

909
00:38:00.376 --> 00:38:02.190
sweat and tears for years and years and years.

910
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:03.704
Giving 150% of their everything

911
00:38:03.704 --> 00:38:06.214
they have to earn what they have.

912
00:38:06.894 --> 00:38:08.825
I bless 'em and say, "You deserve it all,

913
00:38:08.825 --> 00:38:10.958
"whatever you get, you deserve it."

914
00:38:10.958 --> 00:38:13.304
In my case, yeah I mean there's times where it's been...

915
00:38:14.264 --> 00:38:18.275
the whole flow of resources have come a lot easier.

916
00:38:18.275 --> 00:38:20.994
And now it's like a whole different picture.

917
00:38:20.994 --> 00:38:22.594
Where's it gonna go?

918
00:38:22.594 --> 00:38:24.824
That's a really good question that I've done enough

919
00:38:24.824 --> 00:38:27.149
research to realize that no one knows right now.

920
00:38:27.149 --> 00:38:29.677
Are we gonna go back to a paradigm that's been

921
00:38:29.677 --> 00:38:32.460
brought up by people like Radiohead where you go,

922
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.572
"I'm gonna give you this art for fee,

923
00:38:34.572 --> 00:38:36.503
"but if you like it, consider a donation."

924
00:38:36.503 --> 00:38:38.263
I mean this was the great example.

925
00:38:38.263 --> 00:38:40.193
And they got an average of something like

926
00:38:40.193 --> 00:38:44.833
over $8 per CD just voluntarily from people.

927
00:38:44.833 --> 00:38:48.555
Which shows that there is hope in certain small enclaves.

928
00:38:48.555 --> 00:38:51.553
There's hope for people appreciating

929
00:38:51.553 --> 00:38:54.144
the value that that art has for them.

930
00:38:54.144 --> 00:38:56.448
As far as who's gonna change the paradigm,

931
00:38:56.448 --> 00:38:58.148
I don't know that anymore.

932
00:38:58.148 --> 00:38:59.556
You can't lock it up anymore.

933
00:38:59.556 --> 00:39:01.444
Anything that can be heard can be digitized, anything that

934
00:39:01.444 --> 00:39:03.652
can be digitized can be given away for nothing.

935
00:39:03.652 --> 00:39:05.273
<v Voiceover>So maybe it has to start</v>

936
00:39:05.273 --> 00:39:09.475
with each individual embracing their own authenticity

937
00:39:09.475 --> 00:39:12.216
and allowing themselves to create in whatever way.

938
00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:15.395
And as you say, if you can take the judgement off

939
00:39:15.395 --> 00:39:19.000
of what creativity is as we started the conversation,

940
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.536
which I think is beautiful and so appropriate.

941
00:39:21.536 --> 00:39:24.789
If we can do that, and begin seeing

942
00:39:24.789 --> 00:39:26.528
the beauty that flows through.

943
00:39:26.528 --> 00:39:30.346
The pure energy, the balance, the inspiration

944
00:39:30.346 --> 00:39:32.362
that flows through our own individual lives.

945
00:39:32.362 --> 00:39:36.405
Maybe then we'll start appreciating the people

946
00:39:36.405 --> 00:39:38.975
that dedicate their entire lives to the process.

947
00:39:38.975 --> 00:39:40.212
<v ->Well that's a great thought, that brings us</v>

948
00:39:40.212 --> 00:39:42.879
full circle from what we started talking about.

949
00:39:42.879 --> 00:39:45.268
Very encouraging yes.

950
00:39:46.078 --> 00:39:47.787
And as I said the best I can do--

951
00:39:47.787 --> 00:39:48.928
<v Voiceover>It's gonna take some time.</v>

952
00:39:48.928 --> 00:39:51.040
We're pretty dead, we play video,

953
00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.809
our kids play video games, they don't create music.

954
00:39:56.259 --> 00:39:57.954
It's gonna take some time, we have to kind of let

955
00:39:57.954 --> 00:40:00.696
this old way, the thing that's occurring right now...

956
00:40:01.856 --> 00:40:05.045
I really think we have to let it basically decay.

957
00:40:05.045 --> 00:40:07.828
And then inspire, like you say, like your mother

958
00:40:07.828 --> 00:40:10.612
did with you, inspire one person at a time.

959
00:40:10.612 --> 00:40:15.241
To begin playing in the sand, playing with mud cakes,

960
00:40:15.241 --> 00:40:18.047
playing with their little xylophones

961
00:40:18.047 --> 00:40:19.369
in their bedroom when they're two

962
00:40:19.369 --> 00:40:21.278
and three years old and awaken it.

963
00:40:21.278 --> 00:40:23.060
<v ->Well there's the ebb and the flow.</v>

964
00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.897
Right now we're kind of in an ebb in terms of

965
00:40:25.897 --> 00:40:28.467
appreciating the value of creativity and art

966
00:40:28.467 --> 00:40:30.163
I think in a general sense.

967
00:40:30.163 --> 00:40:32.584
But you know what? Historically it comes and it goes.

968
00:40:32.584 --> 00:40:33.950
And they'll be something that may happen

969
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:36.317
that will waken people up again.

970
00:40:36.317 --> 00:40:38.387
Whether it's individual empowerment

971
00:40:38.387 --> 00:40:40.381
or whether it's an apocalypse.

972
00:40:40.381 --> 00:40:42.610
Whatever it takes, art will prevail

973
00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:45.277
and creativity will because creativity is life.

974
00:40:47.497 --> 00:40:49.673
<v Voiceover>Nothing more to say about that.</v>

975
00:40:49.673 --> 00:40:52.574
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me.

976
00:40:52.574 --> 00:40:53.848
<v ->Thanks</v>

977
00:40:55.504 --> 00:40:57.320
<v ->To connect with more of Chris's music,</v>

978
00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:01.480
poetry, and other artwork, you can go to chrisspheeris.com.

979
00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.496
You'll find his photography, meditations,

980
00:41:03.496 --> 00:41:06.493
music and music videos there, all designed to

981
00:41:06.493 --> 00:41:09.928
inspire each of us to create our own song of life.

982
00:41:09.928 --> 00:41:12.925
After all, creativity is what lights up the soul,

983
00:41:12.925 --> 00:41:15.111
which in turn, lights up our lives.

984
00:41:15.111 --> 00:41:18.244
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
