00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.145
<v ->Doctor Joe is one of the most popular speakers</v>

2
00:00:03.145 --> 00:00:05.504
on the documentary, "What the Bleep Do We Know?"

3
00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:08.681
with his fireside chat about constructing one's day

4
00:00:08.681 --> 00:00:10.025
in a positive way.

5
00:00:10.025 --> 00:00:12.543
But his knowledge of the brain goes far beyond

6
00:00:12.543 --> 00:00:13.843
those short clips.

7
00:00:13.843 --> 00:00:16.969
Joe explains in this interview how our brain chemicals work

8
00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:20.224
to keep up embroiled in old habits and patterns,

9
00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:22.696
and what it takes to overcome those patterns,

10
00:00:22.696 --> 00:00:25.992
extremely useful information for anyone with a brain.

11
00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:28.712
One of the dangers he explains is the proliferation

12
00:00:28.712 --> 00:00:31.542
of violent video games in our society.

13
00:00:40.497 --> 00:00:41.755
You know of what you speak,

14
00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:43.728
because you actually had an experience early on

15
00:00:43.728 --> 00:00:46.088
in life that forced you to put these pieces together

16
00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:48.059
to really recover your own health

17
00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.934
and well, beyond your own health, functionality.

18
00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:53.963
Can you talk about it just a little bit?

19
00:00:53.963 --> 00:00:56.054
<v ->Yeah, I was a 26-year-old kid.</v>

20
00:00:56.054 --> 00:00:57.942
I was living in Southern California,

21
00:00:57.942 --> 00:01:01.443
and one of my passions at the time was triathlons.

22
00:01:02.292 --> 00:01:05.523
Anyway, I was in the biking portion of this triathlon

23
00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:09.683
and was making a turn to the oncoming traffic

24
00:01:09.683 --> 00:01:12.401
and there was a cadet waving me on to make the turn,

25
00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:14.350
but he had his back to the traffic

26
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.992
that I was going to merge with.

27
00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:17.186
So he was telling me to turn.

28
00:01:17.186 --> 00:01:19.021
And as I made the turn,

29
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:22.746
a four-wheel drive Bronco going about 55 mile an hour

30
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:26.156
ate my bicycle and then tried to eat me.

31
00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:30.727
I wound up breaking six vertebrae in my spine.

32
00:01:30.727 --> 00:01:32.882
I had multiple compression fractures,

33
00:01:32.882 --> 00:01:35.239
and I had some bone fragments in my spinal cord,

34
00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:38.716
and I had a couple vertebrae that were in pretty bad shape.

35
00:01:38.723 --> 00:01:41.315
Prognosis was pretty poor.

36
00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:43.224
They didn't think I'd walk again,

37
00:01:43.224 --> 00:01:46.125
and the recommendation was some pretty severe surgery

38
00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:47.554
called Harrington rod surgery

39
00:01:47.554 --> 00:01:51.188
where they place long stainless steel rods in your spine.

40
00:01:51.188 --> 00:01:52.692
Anyway, after four opinions

41
00:01:52.692 --> 00:01:55.663
from four of the leading surgeons in Southern California,

42
00:01:55.663 --> 00:01:58.628
I made the decision to not have the surgery,

43
00:01:58.628 --> 00:02:02.386
which at the time, they thought I had lost my mind.

44
00:02:02.968 --> 00:02:06.979
But I couldn't imagine living the rest of my life

45
00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:10.925
with pretty much a handicap.

46
00:02:11.774 --> 00:02:14.154
The principle that I believed in at the time was

47
00:02:14.154 --> 00:02:16.206
the power that made the body, heals the body.

48
00:02:16.206 --> 00:02:18.337
And I still believe in that.

49
00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:21.481
I went from going 100 miles an hour in my life,

50
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:25.021
running a practice and being young and social

51
00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:28.622
and driving foreign sports cars and all that stuff,

52
00:02:29.813 --> 00:02:32.355
to hitting a dead stop.

53
00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:37.755
That moment where I made the decision

54
00:02:37.755 --> 00:02:39.449
was a critical moment, because I had to

55
00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.382
actually believe everything

56
00:02:42.382 --> 00:02:44.723
to the point where I was going to actually apply it.

57
00:02:44.723 --> 00:02:46.445
I had to go from the philosopher

58
00:02:46.445 --> 00:02:49.514
into this initiation and see if I could actually

59
00:02:49.514 --> 00:02:52.037
produce some effects in my body.

60
00:02:53.067 --> 00:02:54.772
I had plenty of time to lay around.

61
00:02:54.772 --> 00:02:56.298
I had nothing else to do.

62
00:02:56.298 --> 00:02:58.430
And so I made the decision that I wasn't going to let

63
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.413
any thought go by unchecked.

64
00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:02.141
That was first thing.

65
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:05.213
The second thing is that, if I believed in that power,

66
00:03:05.213 --> 00:03:07.975
maybe I could develop a relationship with it

67
00:03:07.975 --> 00:03:09.522
and begin to interact with it

68
00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:11.388
and give it some orders or give it a template,

69
00:03:11.388 --> 00:03:14.177
give it some instructions.

70
00:03:17.052 --> 00:03:19.334
They told me that they were going to cast me

71
00:03:19.334 --> 00:03:21.115
for a body cast.

72
00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:22.500
They cast me for a body cast,

73
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.529
and they said, "This isn't the way to go,

74
00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:28.400
"but after six months or so, we'll put you in a body cast,

75
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.924
"and you'll wear that for a year,"

76
00:03:30.924 --> 00:03:33.054
six months to a year, somewhere in there.

77
00:03:33.054 --> 00:03:35.337
Anyway, I started noticing,

78
00:03:35.337 --> 00:03:39.299
after a period of time, I started to notice some changes.

79
00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.675
In the beginning, when I was recreating

80
00:03:43.675 --> 00:03:46.150
every single vertebrae in my mind,

81
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.809
that was the plan I wanted the subconscious to see,

82
00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:52.981
and if my mind went to a fear

83
00:03:52.981 --> 00:03:54.941
or a thought or an apprehension

84
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:59.472
or a random, stray feeling,

85
00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:01.418
I would start all over again,

86
00:04:01.418 --> 00:04:02.506
from the very beginning.

87
00:04:02.506 --> 00:04:03.365
I had nothing else to do.
<v Voiceover>Absolute</v>

88
00:04:03.365 --> 00:04:04.969
vigilance in this.

89
00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:07.886
<v ->What happened was, after a couple weeks,</v>

90
00:04:07.886 --> 00:04:09.592
it got easier.

91
00:04:09.592 --> 00:04:11.331
And the only way I could describe is,

92
00:04:11.331 --> 00:04:14.392
when I was able to fully get that picture done

93
00:04:14.392 --> 00:04:17.080
without any stray thoughts,

94
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.595
it was like hitting a tennis ball in the sweet spot.

95
00:04:19.595 --> 00:04:22.242
It was like hitting a golf ball just right.

96
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:25.557
Something felt right about it.

97
00:04:26.357 --> 00:04:29.014
I paid attention to that.

98
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:33.537
It got easier and easier and less and less time to do.

99
00:04:33.537 --> 00:04:35.308
What I didn't know what I was doing at the time was,

100
00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:39.015
I was literally rewiring my brain.

101
00:04:43.084 --> 00:04:47.058
When I started to notice the measurable changes in my body,

102
00:04:47.058 --> 00:04:49.513
in terms of pain levels and sensations and stuff,

103
00:04:49.513 --> 00:04:52.054
I knew that I was onto something.

104
00:04:52.903 --> 00:04:55.276
Basically, in 10 and a half weeks,

105
00:04:55.276 --> 00:04:58.406
I was back in my office seeing patients.

106
00:04:58.849 --> 00:04:59.992
<v Voiceover>10 and a half weeks?</v>

107
00:04:59.992 --> 00:05:00.698
<v ->Yeah.</v>

108
00:05:00.698 --> 00:05:02.305
<v Voiceover>Less that three months, you were walking?</v>

109
00:05:02.305 --> 00:05:05.184
<v ->Yeah, no body cast, no surgery.</v>

110
00:05:06.277 --> 00:05:08.051
I think during that time,

111
00:05:09.092 --> 00:05:10.373
those nights where I couldn't sleep,

112
00:05:10.373 --> 00:05:12.772
I just made myself a deal

113
00:05:12.772 --> 00:05:14.660
that if I was ever able to walk again,

114
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.995
I'd spend the rest of my life studying

115
00:05:16.995 --> 00:05:19.905
the mind-body connection and this concept

116
00:05:19.905 --> 00:05:21.484
of mind over matter.

117
00:05:21.484 --> 00:05:22.584
<v Voiceover>For a few years past that,</v>

118
00:05:22.584 --> 00:05:24.596
you've spent a lot of years.

119
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.032
Right now, it's what?

120
00:05:26.032 --> 00:05:28.323
Evolve Your Brain, that's really where you're hitting it,

121
00:05:28.323 --> 00:05:31.862
is helping people understand how the brain operates,

122
00:05:31.862 --> 00:05:34.252
how it interfaces with mind, greater mind,

123
00:05:34.252 --> 00:05:36.588
how it interfaces with the body.

124
00:05:36.588 --> 00:05:40.451
And I love this one thing you wrote, which is,

125
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:43.318
if you truly change your mind,

126
00:05:43.318 --> 00:05:45.206
and that's really what you were doing there,

127
00:05:45.206 --> 00:05:47.137
if you change your mind about something,

128
00:05:47.137 --> 00:05:50.241
you can see physical evidence that the brain is changing.

129
00:05:50.241 --> 00:05:51.584
Can we go into that?

130
00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:53.657
What does that mean, how does that apply?

131
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.011
<v ->This concept of neuroplasticity tells us</v>

132
00:05:57.011 --> 00:05:59.347
that every time we learn something new,

133
00:05:59.347 --> 00:06:01.257
we make a new synaptic connection.

134
00:06:01.257 --> 00:06:02.814
Learning is making new connections.

135
00:06:02.814 --> 00:06:06.537
Remembering is maintaining and sustaining those circuits.

136
00:06:06.537 --> 00:06:09.811
So it takes a few repetitions to cause gangs of neurons

137
00:06:09.811 --> 00:06:12.877
to begin to develop long-term relationships.

138
00:06:15.101 --> 00:06:17.201
The concept evolving your brain has to do

139
00:06:17.201 --> 00:06:20.576
with learning new things and having new experiences.

140
00:06:20.955 --> 00:06:24.062
That's the two ways we upscale the hardware.

141
00:06:24.825 --> 00:06:27.268
The brain is just an inanimate organ.

142
00:06:27.268 --> 00:06:31.581
It's no different than the liver or a kidney.

143
00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.140
But mind, now, is

144
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.619
when the brain is in action, when the brain is at work.

145
00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:39.863
Mind is what the brain does.

146
00:06:39.863 --> 00:06:41.942
We have a 100 billion neurons,

147
00:06:41.942 --> 00:06:43.990
seamlessly pieced together,

148
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.692
and the average neuron has about 40,000 connections.

149
00:06:47.692 --> 00:06:50.849
So we can produce infinite levels of mind

150
00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:54.400
by changing the sequence and the pattern

151
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.409
and the combination of how these neurons fire.

152
00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:58.571
When we change our mind,

153
00:06:58.571 --> 00:07:01.476
we're actually making the brain work differently.

154
00:07:01.994 --> 00:07:06.396
We get stuck in fixed patterns, fixed habits,

155
00:07:06.396 --> 00:07:09.297
fixed beliefs and perceptions and attitudes,

156
00:07:09.297 --> 00:07:11.569
and even our own thinking.

157
00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:13.409
The concept in neuroscience says

158
00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:16.641
that nerve cells that fire together, wire together.

159
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:19.223
So if we keep firing the same thoughts,

160
00:07:19.223 --> 00:07:21.333
and we keep performing the same actions,

161
00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:24.022
and we keep embracing the same feelings,

162
00:07:24.022 --> 00:07:26.852
on a daily basis, the brain never changes.

163
00:07:26.852 --> 00:07:30.411
It's by that insistence and repetition

164
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:32.894
that the brain begins to hardwire itself

165
00:07:32.894 --> 00:07:35.028
into a finite set of circuits,

166
00:07:35.028 --> 00:07:37.382
in a finite set of patterns.

167
00:07:37.382 --> 00:07:42.299
That neurochemical finite structure that's developed,

168
00:07:42.299 --> 00:07:44.006
we call the box of the brain.

169
00:07:44.006 --> 00:07:45.659
Now there's no literal box in the brain,

170
00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:47.974
but we begin to think inside the box,

171
00:07:47.974 --> 00:07:51.339
by our own thinking, by our own behaviors,

172
00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:53.953
and by our own states of mind and feelings.

173
00:07:53.953 --> 00:07:57.526
So then, how do we think outside the box?

174
00:07:57.526 --> 00:08:00.332
That is, we have to begin to learn information.

175
00:08:00.332 --> 00:08:02.603
We begin to make those circuits now,

176
00:08:02.603 --> 00:08:05.899
those new connections become the raw materials

177
00:08:05.899 --> 00:08:10.048
to begin to allow the brain to speculate possibilities,

178
00:08:10.048 --> 00:08:13.536
to forecast events, to examine the what-ifs.

179
00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:15.200
What would it be like?

180
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.886
And when we do that,

181
00:08:16.886 --> 00:08:21.706
and we wait long enough to begin to come up with an answer,

182
00:08:21.706 --> 00:08:23.912
part of the brain called the frontal lobe turns on,

183
00:08:23.912 --> 00:08:25.683
which is the CEO of the brain.

184
00:08:25.683 --> 00:08:29.112
It's the leader, it's the symphony leader.

185
00:08:29.112 --> 00:08:32.351
And what it does is, it allows us to begin

186
00:08:32.351 --> 00:08:34.676
to take the knowledge that we've learned

187
00:08:34.676 --> 00:08:36.948
from books and philosophy

188
00:08:36.948 --> 00:08:39.637
and the experiences that we've had,

189
00:08:39.637 --> 00:08:41.880
and it allows us to piece together

190
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.105
new paradigms, new ideas.

191
00:08:44.105 --> 00:08:46.475
We literally make a new mind.

192
00:08:46.475 --> 00:08:50.176
If we are able to change our mind,

193
00:08:50.176 --> 00:08:51.861
and we're able to do that

194
00:08:51.861 --> 00:08:53.749
and reproduce the same pattern,

195
00:08:53.749 --> 00:08:57.429
the same sequence in the same combination,

196
00:08:57.429 --> 00:08:59.861
the effect of that is that teams of neurons

197
00:08:59.861 --> 00:09:01.525
will gang up in new patterns.

198
00:09:01.525 --> 00:09:02.957
We've just changed the brain.

199
00:09:02.957 --> 00:09:06.023
So when we change our mind, the brain changes.

200
00:09:06.023 --> 00:09:08.436
Now once the brain changes,

201
00:09:08.436 --> 00:09:11.816
and the anatomy and the circuitry is different,

202
00:09:11.816 --> 00:09:14.001
it's easier to change our mind,

203
00:09:14.001 --> 00:09:16.401
and so we upscale the hardware

204
00:09:16.401 --> 00:09:18.043
when we change our mind and we change our brain,

205
00:09:18.043 --> 00:09:20.390
and it becomes the new cycle of self.

206
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.338
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about that.</v>

207
00:09:21.338 --> 00:09:23.656
Let's talk about some of the activities, for example,

208
00:09:23.656 --> 00:09:26.426
that help expand on the plasticity of the brain

209
00:09:26.426 --> 00:09:28.343
and the process you just talked about.

210
00:09:28.343 --> 00:09:30.028
For example, a foreign language.

211
00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:32.289
Say I want to learn Italian.

212
00:09:32.289 --> 00:09:33.932
What's happening there?

213
00:09:33.932 --> 00:09:36.976
Talk us through it a little bit so we can understand.

214
00:09:36.982 --> 00:09:39.275
<v ->Well, we have three brains in one,</v>

215
00:09:39.275 --> 00:09:41.857
three brains that allow us to go from thinking,

216
00:09:41.857 --> 00:09:43.508
to doing, to being.

217
00:09:43.508 --> 00:09:46.166
Now, the thinking brain is the neocortex.

218
00:09:46.166 --> 00:09:49.130
It's the big walnut on the outside with all the corrugations

219
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.241
and folds and valleys.

220
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:54.044
The reason it has all those folds and valleys is

221
00:09:54.044 --> 00:09:56.468
because we can stuff more brain matter

222
00:09:56.468 --> 00:09:58.983
into a small cavern, right?

223
00:09:59.723 --> 00:10:01.719
That first brain is the new brain,

224
00:10:01.719 --> 00:10:02.893
that's the thinking brain.

225
00:10:02.893 --> 00:10:04.739
When you learn information and philosophy

226
00:10:04.739 --> 00:10:06.960
and facts and semantics,

227
00:10:08.598 --> 00:10:10.240
when you learn information,

228
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.351
you wire that in the thinking brain.

229
00:10:12.351 --> 00:10:16.825
Now, its not enough to just learn information.

230
00:10:17.289 --> 00:10:19.627
You can learn all the words of Italian,

231
00:10:19.627 --> 00:10:21.129
you can read the book,

232
00:10:21.129 --> 00:10:23.102
you can listen to the tapes.

233
00:10:23.102 --> 00:10:24.382
But all of that information

234
00:10:24.382 --> 00:10:26.762
is still stored in your thinking brain.

235
00:10:26.762 --> 00:10:30.428
Now, in order to activate the second brain,

236
00:10:30.428 --> 00:10:32.519
you gotta apply what you learn.

237
00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:34.983
You have to personalize it, you have to demonstrate it.

238
00:10:34.983 --> 00:10:38.419
You have to actually modify your behavior in some way.

239
00:10:38.419 --> 00:10:40.284
And when you do that,

240
00:10:40.284 --> 00:10:42.372
you have a new experience.

241
00:10:42.372 --> 00:10:44.846
When we have a new experience, when we're

242
00:10:44.846 --> 00:10:47.184
in the midst of that experience, everything we're seeing

243
00:10:47.184 --> 00:10:49.198
and smelling and tasting and feeling and hearing,

244
00:10:49.198 --> 00:10:52.078
all of our five senses are in the midst

245
00:10:52.078 --> 00:10:54.137
of this dimensional process.

246
00:10:54.137 --> 00:10:57.219
And all the information is traveling back to the brain,

247
00:10:57.219 --> 00:10:59.621
through those five different sensory pathways.

248
00:10:59.621 --> 00:11:02.467
And it causes gangs of neurons to string into place

249
00:11:02.467 --> 00:11:05.634
and then force the brain to release chemicals.

250
00:11:05.634 --> 00:11:08.418
Those chemical now are called feelings.

251
00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:11.277
And the moment we have a new feeling,

252
00:11:11.277 --> 00:11:13.186
it means we've had a new experience.

253
00:11:13.186 --> 00:11:15.651
Feelings and emotions are the end product of experience.

254
00:11:15.651 --> 00:11:17.676
<v Voiceover>Okay. So along this line, then,</v>

255
00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:19.692
are you saying we can learn the words,

256
00:11:19.692 --> 00:11:23.169
but until we go to an Italian cafe, use our Italian--

257
00:11:23.169 --> 00:11:24.097
<v ->Open your mouth.
<v Voiceover>To order an</v>

258
00:11:24.097 --> 00:11:27.150
incredible cappuccino and try to speak to the--

259
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.204
<v ->Interact.</v>

260
00:11:28.204 --> 00:11:29.889
<v Voiceover>Yes, interact.</v>
<v ->Now, when you interact,</v>

261
00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:32.788
the sensory process of interaction...

262
00:11:32.788 --> 00:11:34.377
Remember, knowledge is for the mind,

263
00:11:34.377 --> 00:11:36.158
experience is for the body.

264
00:11:36.158 --> 00:11:37.790
We have to teach the body

265
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.179
what the mind has intellectually understood.

266
00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:41.886
And when we're able to do that,

267
00:11:41.886 --> 00:11:43.859
that second brain system turns on,

268
00:11:43.859 --> 00:11:45.832
called the limbic brain, or the chemical brain,

269
00:11:45.832 --> 00:11:47.334
or the mammalian brain.

270
00:11:47.334 --> 00:11:49.350
Now we have two brains working together.

271
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.093
Now we're ordering Italian food,

272
00:11:52.093 --> 00:11:54.568
we're ordering the San Giovese or the Brunello wine,

273
00:11:54.568 --> 00:11:58.737
or we're having a conversation with the waiter,

274
00:11:58.737 --> 00:11:59.869
and we're interacting.

275
00:11:59.869 --> 00:12:03.709
Now the experience is causing more hardware

276
00:12:03.709 --> 00:12:07.144
to reflect what we've done in the environment.

277
00:12:07.144 --> 00:12:11.151
So now the body now is getting a new chemical signal.

278
00:12:11.151 --> 00:12:13.564
But it's not enough to go to the restaurant once

279
00:12:13.564 --> 00:12:15.946
and then say you're fluent in Italian.

280
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.726
You have to be able to repeat the experience.

281
00:12:18.726 --> 00:12:20.592
And when we begin to start off,

282
00:12:20.592 --> 00:12:22.768
we're very conscious and very willful,

283
00:12:22.768 --> 00:12:25.230
if we keep reproducing the experience,

284
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.909
what happens after a certain amount of time

285
00:12:27.909 --> 00:12:30.265
is that we activate that third brain,

286
00:12:30.265 --> 00:12:33.412
and that third brain is the being brain, right?

287
00:12:33.412 --> 00:12:35.043
We went from doing to being, which means

288
00:12:35.043 --> 00:12:37.721
that we've practiced it so many times

289
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:40.975
that it becomes subconscious or it becomes unconscious.

290
00:12:40.975 --> 00:12:43.555
Which means that particular brain

291
00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:46.008
is the subconscious brain, called the cerebellum.

292
00:12:46.008 --> 00:12:48.771
And what it allows us to do is to memorize skills

293
00:12:48.771 --> 00:12:51.599
and habits and behaviors, emotional reactions,

294
00:12:51.599 --> 00:12:54.202
conditioning, associative memories,

295
00:12:54.202 --> 00:12:57.240
That's all lodged in that subconscious brain.

296
00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.843
We've practiced it so many times

297
00:12:59.843 --> 00:13:02.510
that neurochemically, we conditioned the body

298
00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.879
to memorize it as well as the conscious brain.

299
00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:08.613
An example of that is, when we were young,

300
00:13:08.613 --> 00:13:10.219
not so much any more, but,

301
00:13:10.219 --> 00:13:11.905
someone says, "How do you spell that word?"

302
00:13:11.905 --> 00:13:13.685
You can't consciously remember, but then you go

303
00:13:13.685 --> 00:13:15.456
like this, and you spell it in the air,

304
00:13:15.456 --> 00:13:18.485
or you can't remember a phone number on the phone,

305
00:13:18.485 --> 00:13:19.477
and then you pick up the phone.

306
00:13:19.477 --> 00:13:20.556
You couldn't consciously remember it,

307
00:13:20.556 --> 00:13:22.877
but your body was able to do it.

308
00:13:22.877 --> 00:13:26.088
That means the body has become the mind.

309
00:13:26.088 --> 00:13:28.349
And when the body becomes the mind,

310
00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:29.705
that's called a habit.

311
00:13:29.705 --> 00:13:31.368
A habit is when the body becomes the mind.

312
00:13:32.598 --> 00:13:34.537
If we repeat the experience over and over again,

313
00:13:34.537 --> 00:13:36.754
it gets lodged into the subconscious system,

314
00:13:36.754 --> 00:13:38.664
what we call the being system.

315
00:13:38.664 --> 00:13:40.488
Now, when we're in that being system,

316
00:13:40.488 --> 00:13:44.979
90% of who we are, by the time we're 35,

317
00:13:44.979 --> 00:13:48.725
is wired in behaviors, automatic programs

318
00:13:48.725 --> 00:13:50.481
that exist in the subconscious system.

319
00:13:50.481 --> 00:13:53.110
So the person wants to change, for example,

320
00:13:54.183 --> 00:13:55.974
as a different example, they wanna be happy,

321
00:13:55.974 --> 00:13:58.352
but they've suffered and memorized

322
00:13:58.352 --> 00:13:59.995
that emotional state for 20 years.

323
00:13:59.995 --> 00:14:02.106
They have mind and body working in opposition.

324
00:14:02.106 --> 00:14:04.324
But in terms of the language, now,

325
00:14:04.324 --> 00:14:06.478
if we keep practicing it, there'll come a moment

326
00:14:06.478 --> 00:14:09.401
where we don't have to think about what we're saying.

327
00:14:09.401 --> 00:14:11.854
The brain is firing in a very synchronous pattern

328
00:14:11.854 --> 00:14:14.683
and we're flowing through a stream of consciousness.

329
00:14:14.683 --> 00:14:18.129
And when we get to that state of being now,

330
00:14:18.466 --> 00:14:21.388
it's hard wired, which means it's integrated

331
00:14:21.388 --> 00:14:24.108
in our nervous system and it takes no effort at all.

332
00:14:24.108 --> 00:14:25.516
So we can have a stray thought,

333
00:14:25.516 --> 00:14:27.479
or we can see something in our environment.

334
00:14:27.479 --> 00:14:29.518
The moment that happens, neural networks

335
00:14:29.518 --> 00:14:31.958
begin to fire in huge patterns,

336
00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:35.382
and now it becomes part of us.

337
00:14:35.382 --> 00:14:37.313
<v Voiceover>So let's talk about the journey,</v>

338
00:14:37.313 --> 00:14:40.673
say, almost the polar opposite of saying,

339
00:14:40.673 --> 00:14:41.931
"Geez, I'd love to learn Italian.

340
00:14:41.931 --> 00:14:44.224
"I'm going to go do that and create these new pathways."

341
00:14:44.224 --> 00:14:46.741
"I have become addicted to something.

342
00:14:46.741 --> 00:14:48.832
"And it's taking me down, and I haven't known anything

343
00:14:48.832 --> 00:14:52.128
"except need and despair and these cycles

344
00:14:52.128 --> 00:14:55.501
"for, say, 40 years," for some people.

345
00:14:55.945 --> 00:14:59.742
How do you begin do to this, and what kind of resistance

346
00:14:59.742 --> 00:15:01.022
do you come up against?

347
00:15:01.022 --> 00:15:04.232
What is the most effective way to begin--

348
00:15:04.232 --> 00:15:06.047
<v ->How much time do we have? (laughs)</v>

349
00:15:06.047 --> 00:15:06.942
<v Voiceover>Five minute.</v>

350
00:15:06.942 --> 00:15:08.765
No, go for it.

351
00:15:08.765 --> 00:15:12.808
<v ->This is the, you know, the trillion dollar question.</v>

352
00:15:12.808 --> 00:15:16.003
Every time I'm on talk shows or television,

353
00:15:16.003 --> 00:15:18.413
there's two minutes left or 30 seconds left

354
00:15:18.413 --> 00:15:21.580
and the host says, "Now, can you tell me how to change?"

355
00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:22.369
I always say--

356
00:15:22.369 --> 00:15:24.284
<v Voiceover>We've got time, a little time here.</v>

357
00:15:24.284 --> 00:15:27.068
"Come into my workshop, it's down the road."

358
00:15:27.068 --> 00:15:28.915
But listen, every time we have a thought,

359
00:15:28.915 --> 00:15:30.684
we make a chemical, right?

360
00:15:30.684 --> 00:15:32.723
Great thoughts make great chemicals.

361
00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:34.706
They make us feel great.

362
00:15:34.706 --> 00:15:36.316
Negative thoughts make chemicals

363
00:15:36.316 --> 00:15:37.980
that make us feel negative.

364
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.785
So this etherical thing called thought

365
00:15:40.785 --> 00:15:43.910
produces a set of chemical reactions in the brain

366
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.821
that activates circuits for us to begin to feel

367
00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.485
exactly the way we were just thinking.

368
00:15:48.485 --> 00:15:50.683
You have an insecure thought, in a matter of seconds,

369
00:15:50.683 --> 00:15:52.485
you feel insecure.

370
00:15:52.485 --> 00:15:54.970
The moment you begin to feel the way you think

371
00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.976
because the brain is in constant communication

372
00:15:56.976 --> 00:16:00.877
with the body, you begin to think the way you feel,

373
00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:02.242
which then makes more chemicals

374
00:16:02.242 --> 00:16:03.383
for you to feel the way you think--

375
00:16:03.383 --> 00:16:04.600
<v Voiceover>So you're on a cycle?</v>

376
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.649
<v ->That cycle, that repetition, that redundancy,</v>

377
00:16:07.649 --> 00:16:11.447
over time, produces a state of being

378
00:16:11.447 --> 00:16:14.167
where we've conditioned the body chemically

379
00:16:14.167 --> 00:16:15.991
to memorize that state.

380
00:16:15.991 --> 00:16:19.532
So the person then says, "I am insecure."

381
00:16:19.532 --> 00:16:22.028
So the redundancy of that thinking and feeling

382
00:16:22.028 --> 00:16:23.617
and feeling and thinking

383
00:16:23.617 --> 00:16:25.932
creates a state of being in which feelings

384
00:16:25.932 --> 00:16:27.458
become the means of thinking,

385
00:16:27.458 --> 00:16:30.314
or we can't think greater than how we feel.

386
00:16:30.314 --> 00:16:32.489
If we can't think greater than how we feel,

387
00:16:32.489 --> 00:16:33.908
we'll never change.

388
00:16:33.908 --> 00:16:36.063
So the person, then, who's in need,

389
00:16:36.063 --> 00:16:38.356
who's in suffering, who's in pain,

390
00:16:38.356 --> 00:16:40.873
they've memorized that emotional state for 20 years,

391
00:16:40.873 --> 00:16:43.561
that now is lodged in that subconscious system

392
00:16:43.561 --> 00:16:44.904
that we just talked about.

393
00:16:44.904 --> 00:16:48.114
So they can consciously say, "I wanna be happy."

394
00:16:48.114 --> 00:16:50.888
But their mind intentionally, intellectually is saying,

395
00:16:50.888 --> 00:16:53.437
"I wanna be happy," but their body has memorized

396
00:16:53.437 --> 00:16:54.514
need and suffering.

397
00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:57.099
So mind and body are working in opposition.

398
00:16:58.129 --> 00:16:59.773
When the person decides to consciously

399
00:16:59.773 --> 00:17:01.660
try to make an effort to change,

400
00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.134
they find themselves in a matter of hours

401
00:17:04.134 --> 00:17:05.499
performing the same actions

402
00:17:05.499 --> 00:17:06.737
and thinking the same thoughts,

403
00:17:06.737 --> 00:17:08.689
and they've gone unconscious.

404
00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:11.227
Well, the only way that we can make those changes

405
00:17:11.227 --> 00:17:13.894
is to go into the operating system,

406
00:17:13.894 --> 00:17:16.688
that we have to begin to eliminate the environment.

407
00:17:16.688 --> 00:17:19.515
We have to begin to think independent on the environment.

408
00:17:19.515 --> 00:17:22.266
We have to eliminate the external world

409
00:17:22.266 --> 00:17:23.909
and begin to change our brainwaves

410
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:27.833
and begin to allow ourselves to enter

411
00:17:27.833 --> 00:17:29.132
into that subconscious realm.

412
00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:30.327
<v Voiceover>What's that look like?</v>

413
00:17:30.327 --> 00:17:32.481
How does one functionally go about this?

414
00:17:32.481 --> 00:17:33.839
<v ->Okay.</v>

415
00:17:34.848 --> 00:17:38.282
Let me answer that by just developing

416
00:17:38.282 --> 00:17:40.931
just another idea here.

417
00:17:42.453 --> 00:17:44.383
The same brain systems that allow us to go

418
00:17:44.383 --> 00:17:46.569
from thinking to doing to being

419
00:17:46.569 --> 00:17:48.606
are the same brain systems that allow us

420
00:17:48.606 --> 00:17:50.590
to learn knowledge, to have an experience,

421
00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.041
and gain wisdom.

422
00:17:52.041 --> 00:17:54.262
Mind, body, soul.

423
00:17:57.233 --> 00:18:01.244
We reach a certain age where those automatic programs

424
00:18:01.244 --> 00:18:03.494
run without our conscious awareness.

425
00:18:03.494 --> 00:18:06.971
So we have a behavior for every person we meet,

426
00:18:06.971 --> 00:18:09.797
and we have a strategy of how to act

427
00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:13.446
in different conditions, and we memorize those.

428
00:18:13.446 --> 00:18:16.112
And what happens is, in the long run is,

429
00:18:16.112 --> 00:18:19.622
that the moment that those programs run,

430
00:18:19.622 --> 00:18:21.392
they're just like a computer program.

431
00:18:21.392 --> 00:18:24.624
If your computer program starts acting haywire,

432
00:18:24.624 --> 00:18:26.288
and you're trying to use your conscious mind

433
00:18:26.288 --> 00:18:28.711
to change it, it would be like you yelling at the computer,

434
00:18:28.711 --> 00:18:31.247
saying, "Stop, don't do that."

435
00:18:31.247 --> 00:18:32.911
And it'll just keep running.

436
00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:34.415
So we have to learn how to get

437
00:18:34.415 --> 00:18:37.106
into the operating systems to change that.

438
00:18:38.275 --> 00:18:40.610
The whole purpose of meditation,

439
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.576
the whole purpose of the internal journey,

440
00:18:43.576 --> 00:18:47.479
is to get beyond analysis, to get beyond that thinking,

441
00:18:47.479 --> 00:18:49.880
survival, ego mind that's based

442
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.156
in overanalyzing

443
00:18:54.831 --> 00:18:56.564
and critiquing.

444
00:18:56.564 --> 00:19:01.393
And meditation, the actual word in Tibetan means

445
00:19:01.393 --> 00:19:04.913
to become familiar with, to make known.

446
00:19:04.913 --> 00:19:07.987
If you begin to become familiar

447
00:19:08.462 --> 00:19:11.695
with your unconscious thoughts and make them conscious,

448
00:19:11.695 --> 00:19:14.051
and you begin to make known your unconscious

449
00:19:14.051 --> 00:19:16.024
behaviors and unconscious actions

450
00:19:16.024 --> 00:19:18.222
and you make them conscious,

451
00:19:18.222 --> 00:19:21.485
and you begin to observe how you feel

452
00:19:21.485 --> 00:19:23.747
and act and think,

453
00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:27.234
that concept in neuroscience is called metacognition.

454
00:19:27.234 --> 00:19:28.942
And the privilege of being a human being

455
00:19:28.942 --> 00:19:31.245
is that we can observe our own thoughts.

456
00:19:31.245 --> 00:19:33.540
We can reflect on our own actions.

457
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.698
And we can consciously look at how we behave

458
00:19:37.698 --> 00:19:38.946
and how we feel,

459
00:19:38.946 --> 00:19:41.815
so that we can modify our behavior and make a plan

460
00:19:41.815 --> 00:19:43.681
on how we're gonna think and act

461
00:19:43.681 --> 00:19:45.496
in the same circumstances.

462
00:19:45.496 --> 00:19:46.592
<v Voiceover>Was this sort of the journey</v>

463
00:19:46.592 --> 00:19:49.089
you were on while lying in bed, having to watch

464
00:19:49.089 --> 00:19:51.245
all of your thoughts,

465
00:19:51.245 --> 00:19:53.217
every feeling that came up,

466
00:19:53.217 --> 00:19:55.468
and observe what was going on truly in you?

467
00:19:55.468 --> 00:19:56.463
<v ->If it was serving me or not.</v>

468
00:19:56.463 --> 00:19:57.487
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

469
00:19:58.053 --> 00:20:00.384
If we look at the concept of meditation, then,

470
00:20:00.384 --> 00:20:02.079
in terms of becoming familiar with,

471
00:20:02.079 --> 00:20:04.170
if we sat down and no longer allowed

472
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:07.030
the environment to activate the same circuits in our brain

473
00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.940
because we recognize the same people

474
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.136
and we do the same things and we go to the same places

475
00:20:11.136 --> 00:20:13.428
and we have the same experiences,

476
00:20:13.428 --> 00:20:15.337
when we eliminate the environment

477
00:20:15.337 --> 00:20:17.396
and we begin to think independent of the environment,

478
00:20:17.396 --> 00:20:19.680
in fact, we're meditating.

479
00:20:20.178 --> 00:20:23.836
When we begin to become conscious

480
00:20:23.836 --> 00:20:25.276
of those unconscious programs,

481
00:20:25.276 --> 00:20:27.942
we've just entered the operating system.

482
00:20:27.942 --> 00:20:30.298
Brain waves change, they slow down,

483
00:20:30.298 --> 00:20:33.082
we're no longer on survival, we're no longer

484
00:20:33.082 --> 00:20:35.857
outwardly pushing as an ego,

485
00:20:35.857 --> 00:20:39.804
but in fact, we're allowing our mind and body

486
00:20:39.804 --> 00:20:41.979
to begin to give us information.

487
00:20:41.979 --> 00:20:44.335
Now, if you're able to, then,

488
00:20:44.335 --> 00:20:47.013
after you become aware that you're needy

489
00:20:47.013 --> 00:20:50.761
or unworthy or doubt yourself,

490
00:20:52.333 --> 00:20:56.323
you could actually surrender that attitude

491
00:20:56.323 --> 00:20:57.644
to the power within you,

492
00:20:57.644 --> 00:21:02.019
because it has an intelligence much greater than you and I.

493
00:21:02.019 --> 00:21:05.644
I mean, if you can make 10 million cells in one second,

494
00:21:05.644 --> 00:21:08.545
you gotta know a few more things than you and I know.

495
00:21:08.545 --> 00:21:11.404
And if you can manage a 100,000 chemical reactions

496
00:21:11.404 --> 00:21:16.404
in one cell per second, you got a pretty big will

497
00:21:16.591 --> 00:21:18.849
and a pretty big to-do list.

498
00:21:18.849 --> 00:21:22.038
And if you can keep a person alive

499
00:21:22.038 --> 00:21:25.291
and love life more than they love life,

500
00:21:25.291 --> 00:21:28.908
when their fickle ego and personality wants to die,

501
00:21:28.908 --> 00:21:32.406
something's loving us much greater than we are.

502
00:21:32.406 --> 00:21:36.160
And it only responds when we ask it to.

503
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.762
It loves us that unconditionally.

504
00:21:38.762 --> 00:21:41.641
So that mind gives,

505
00:21:41.641 --> 00:21:45.703
endorses and gives life to however we're being.

506
00:21:45.703 --> 00:21:47.976
So the field, the quantum field,

507
00:21:47.976 --> 00:21:50.929
that is, the field that keeps the intelligence

508
00:21:50.929 --> 00:21:53.585
that keeps the planets rotating around the sun,

509
00:21:53.585 --> 00:21:56.831
is the same intelligence that's keeping our heart beating.

510
00:21:57.968 --> 00:22:01.199
When we begin to move into a state of being, then,

511
00:22:01.199 --> 00:22:04.890
because we've began to learn and experience

512
00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.865
and memorize new emotions and unlearn,

513
00:22:07.865 --> 00:22:09.369
one of the things that happens is,

514
00:22:09.369 --> 00:22:11.237
is that because we can make thought more real

515
00:22:11.237 --> 00:22:14.642
than anything else, in fact,

516
00:22:14.642 --> 00:22:18.204
after we surrender that emotional state,

517
00:22:18.204 --> 00:22:20.092
that limited or afflictive emotional state

518
00:22:20.092 --> 00:22:23.324
to this mind, we can reinvent ourselves.

519
00:22:23.324 --> 00:22:25.799
And there's been enough neuroscientific experiments

520
00:22:25.799 --> 00:22:28.380
to prove that we can change the brain

521
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.843
just by thinking differently.

522
00:22:30.843 --> 00:22:33.702
Now, how many people take the time

523
00:22:33.702 --> 00:22:35.067
to sit there and do that?

524
00:22:35.067 --> 00:22:36.059
You know why?

525
00:22:36.059 --> 00:22:38.031
Because when you and I, in the past,

526
00:22:38.031 --> 00:22:39.696
have had an uncomfortable feeling,

527
00:22:39.696 --> 00:22:41.851
the way we make that uncomfortable feeling go away is,

528
00:22:41.851 --> 00:22:43.621
you turn on the TV, you get on the cell phone,

529
00:22:43.621 --> 00:22:46.726
you get on the computer, and so that external thing,

530
00:22:46.726 --> 00:22:49.573
something outside of us, produces a momentary

531
00:22:49.573 --> 00:22:52.090
internal chemical change and we pay attention

532
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.881
to whatever that was that made us feel better.

533
00:22:53.881 --> 00:22:58.189
Not consciously, but through the subconscious association.

534
00:22:58.189 --> 00:23:02.712
And that identification of that person or that computer

535
00:23:02.712 --> 00:23:05.646
or that cell phone or that TV,

536
00:23:05.646 --> 00:23:08.386
that program making us feel better,

537
00:23:08.386 --> 00:23:12.086
changing us internally, is an event in and of itself.

538
00:23:12.086 --> 00:23:13.996
And that's what creates the strong

539
00:23:13.996 --> 00:23:16.385
identification or association.

540
00:23:16.385 --> 00:23:18.583
The person then, when they're uncomfortable

541
00:23:18.583 --> 00:23:20.416
and they don't like the way they feel,

542
00:23:20.416 --> 00:23:23.297
instead of looking and saying, "I can surrender this

543
00:23:23.297 --> 00:23:26.816
"to a greater mind, I can reinvent myself.

544
00:23:26.816 --> 00:23:29.376
"What is the greatest ideal of myself?

545
00:23:29.376 --> 00:23:31.990
"Let me begin to think in different ways.

546
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:34.454
"What piece of knowledge, what book can I read

547
00:23:34.454 --> 00:23:36.299
"to inspire me to begin

548
00:23:36.299 --> 00:23:40.677
"to create a renaissance within myself?"

549
00:23:41.707 --> 00:23:43.595
That, the brain will change as a result of that,

550
00:23:43.595 --> 00:23:45.546
and it will rewire itself.

551
00:23:45.546 --> 00:23:48.469
But most people become dependent on the environment.

552
00:23:48.469 --> 00:23:50.111
<v Voiceover>Or drugs?</v>
<v ->Or drugs.</v>

553
00:23:50.111 --> 00:23:52.191
Well, first the environment and then drugs.

554
00:23:52.191 --> 00:23:53.813
<v Voiceover>And I'm not saying illegal drugs.</v>

555
00:23:53.813 --> 00:23:56.106
Even prescription drugs, in particular,

556
00:23:56.106 --> 00:23:58.287
even far more sore.

557
00:23:59.114 --> 00:24:01.343
Can the brain, when you're messing

558
00:24:01.343 --> 00:24:04.500
with the actual brain chemicals and neurochemistry,

559
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.177
can the brain still make these sorts of changes

560
00:24:07.177 --> 00:24:09.225
if you so desire and you're willing to be

561
00:24:09.225 --> 00:24:12.521
that diligent about it, in the presence of drugs

562
00:24:12.521 --> 00:24:14.760
that are doing who knows what

563
00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.116
to the neurochemicals?

564
00:24:16.116 --> 00:24:19.103
<v ->Well, there are certain people who need medications.</v>

565
00:24:19.103 --> 00:24:20.713
There's no doubt about it.

566
00:24:20.713 --> 00:24:23.251
Because they have a chemical imbalance in their brain.

567
00:24:23.251 --> 00:24:26.515
But remember, a shift in consciousness

568
00:24:26.515 --> 00:24:29.266
produces a change in chemistry.

569
00:24:29.266 --> 00:24:32.573
And chemistry are emotions, and emotions are energy.

570
00:24:32.573 --> 00:24:33.832
So we change our consciousness,

571
00:24:33.832 --> 00:24:36.392
there's a change in emotions, there's a change in energy.

572
00:24:36.392 --> 00:24:38.855
And the body begins to regulate

573
00:24:38.855 --> 00:24:40.573
a whole new set of chemicals.

574
00:24:40.573 --> 00:24:41.713
<v Voiceover>So what happens if you're</v>

575
00:24:41.713 --> 00:24:43.198
on an antidepressant?

576
00:24:43.198 --> 00:24:44.723
You don't wanna be on it any longer,

577
00:24:44.723 --> 00:24:46.099
and you want to shift those chemicals

578
00:24:46.099 --> 00:24:48.505
because they're hearing what you say right now.

579
00:24:49.353 --> 00:24:50.495
How does that work?

580
00:24:50.495 --> 00:24:52.948
<v ->I wouldn't tell the person to come off right away</v>

581
00:24:52.948 --> 00:24:56.041
without beginning to get some study.

582
00:24:56.041 --> 00:24:58.046
But I will tell you that, you know,

583
00:24:58.046 --> 00:25:01.619
our definition of free will is such a bizarre concept

584
00:25:01.619 --> 00:25:03.091
in our culture.

585
00:25:03.091 --> 00:25:04.627
We don't really have free will.

586
00:25:04.627 --> 00:25:06.536
What we have is choices.

587
00:25:06.536 --> 00:25:08.393
And we make choices based on knowns.

588
00:25:08.393 --> 00:25:09.768
That's not free will.

589
00:25:09.768 --> 00:25:12.372
Free will is to make a choice based on unknowns.

590
00:25:12.372 --> 00:25:14.013
The problem with unknowns is that,

591
00:25:14.013 --> 00:25:16.594
if you're living in the chemicals of survival,

592
00:25:16.594 --> 00:25:19.058
run by adrenaline and cortisone,

593
00:25:19.058 --> 00:25:23.239
those chemicals are the exact mechanisms,

594
00:25:23.239 --> 00:25:27.168
the substrates, that allow you to fear the unknown.

595
00:25:27.728 --> 00:25:31.611
Because anything unfamiliar, if you're a deer in the wild

596
00:25:31.611 --> 00:25:35.356
or an animal in survival,

597
00:25:35.356 --> 00:25:37.297
you see a logging truck,

598
00:25:37.297 --> 00:25:39.676
it's making noise, smells different, feels different,

599
00:25:39.676 --> 00:25:41.990
looks different, you're gonna run.

600
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:46.159
And so, when we live by those vigilant chemicals,

601
00:25:46.159 --> 00:25:48.937
we never embrace the unknown as an adventure.

602
00:25:48.937 --> 00:25:51.658
So free will, then, becomes this choice.

603
00:25:51.658 --> 00:25:55.251
Do I take Bayer or do I take Advil for a headache?

604
00:25:55.251 --> 00:25:58.855
Is that the only options in the universe?

605
00:25:58.855 --> 00:26:01.394
So the person who's on that prescriptive medication,

606
00:26:01.394 --> 00:26:02.957
for example...

607
00:26:03.805 --> 00:26:05.180
<v Voiceover>Which has side effects.</v>

608
00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.478
<v ->Just talk about Prozac for a second.</v>

609
00:26:07.478 --> 00:26:10.699
There's studies to prove that, if you did six weeks

610
00:26:10.699 --> 00:26:14.336
of aerobic exercise, it works just as good as Prozac,

611
00:26:14.336 --> 00:26:16.010
if not better.

612
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:19.626
If you meditated, mindfulness meditation,

613
00:26:19.626 --> 00:26:21.940
continuously bringing your attention

614
00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.052
back to the present moment,

615
00:26:24.052 --> 00:26:26.261
you're concentrating on your breath

616
00:26:26.261 --> 00:26:28.564
and staying focused, and switching from

617
00:26:28.564 --> 00:26:30.515
that fight or flight nervous system

618
00:26:30.515 --> 00:26:33.150
to the nervous system of relaxation,

619
00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:36.041
you will reregulate your nervous system,

620
00:26:36.041 --> 00:26:37.886
and you'll produce alpha brain waves,

621
00:26:37.886 --> 00:26:39.912
which will then regulate chemical changes

622
00:26:39.912 --> 00:26:42.813
in the body, cascade all the way down.

623
00:26:42.813 --> 00:26:46.606
So the person then, who wants to come off the Prozac,

624
00:26:47.143 --> 00:26:49.137
has to make up their mind.

625
00:26:49.137 --> 00:26:52.956
They have to say, "Listen, I may be depressed,

626
00:26:52.956 --> 00:26:55.046
"but I have to still be able to think

627
00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:56.411
"greater than how I feel.

628
00:26:56.411 --> 00:26:58.853
"In my darkest moments, I have to believe

629
00:26:58.853 --> 00:27:00.923
"that this will pass."

630
00:27:00.923 --> 00:27:02.747
Now, the person who's gonna do that

631
00:27:02.747 --> 00:27:05.957
has to learn a lot about themselves

632
00:27:05.957 --> 00:27:08.828
and a lot about limited states of mind.

633
00:27:08.828 --> 00:27:10.513
Depression, on a functional brain scan,

634
00:27:10.513 --> 00:27:13.321
depression and anxiety look exactly the same.

635
00:27:13.935 --> 00:27:16.741
Anxiety is looking to the future, and being vigilant

636
00:27:16.741 --> 00:27:19.045
about the outcome, and depression is looking

637
00:27:19.045 --> 00:27:20.870
to the past and not seeing a future.

638
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:22.681
But on a functional scan, it's the same thing.

639
00:27:22.681 --> 00:27:24.753
And most people who are anxious are depressed.

640
00:27:24.753 --> 00:27:27.023
Most people who are depressed are anxious.

641
00:27:27.023 --> 00:27:29.561
It's just living in the past or living in the future,

642
00:27:29.561 --> 00:27:31.289
and not living in the present moment.

643
00:27:31.289 --> 00:27:34.231
So we learn information about depression.

644
00:27:34.231 --> 00:27:37.826
Know the nuances so that you can make different choices.

645
00:27:37.826 --> 00:27:41.037
Now you get about applying what you learned, right?

646
00:27:41.037 --> 00:27:42.806
You get about going,

647
00:27:43.546 --> 00:27:46.061
"What would it be like to be a happy person?

648
00:27:46.061 --> 00:27:48.129
"Who do I know in my life that's great,

649
00:27:48.129 --> 00:27:50.124
"and what are the qualities that they have?

650
00:27:50.124 --> 00:27:52.994
"Who in history do I admire that I wanna be like?

651
00:27:52.994 --> 00:27:54.902
"What do I have to change about myself,

652
00:27:54.902 --> 00:27:56.864
"and what thoughts do I keep thinking

653
00:27:56.864 --> 00:27:58.859
"that keep making the same chemicals,

654
00:27:58.859 --> 00:28:00.992
"that made me feel the same way,

655
00:28:00.992 --> 00:28:03.637
"that bring me to my lowest denominator?"

656
00:28:03.637 --> 00:28:06.276
This discovery of self, then,

657
00:28:06.675 --> 00:28:08.243
if we eliminate the environment and begin

658
00:28:08.243 --> 00:28:10.944
to think this way, the brain's gonna begin to change.

659
00:28:10.944 --> 00:28:12.245
In the beginning, it'll be hard,

660
00:28:12.245 --> 00:28:14.291
because the untrained mind

661
00:28:14.291 --> 00:28:16.798
is an unbridled horse, we all know that.

662
00:28:16.798 --> 00:28:18.581
But if we persist

663
00:28:19.205 --> 00:28:21.522
in, what is that ideal of ourselves,

664
00:28:21.522 --> 00:28:24.817
not only will we change the brain just by thinking,

665
00:28:24.817 --> 00:28:28.095
but if we say, "I'm not gonna get up today

666
00:28:29.179 --> 00:28:31.982
"until I feel like a different person,"

667
00:28:31.982 --> 00:28:35.058
the moment we begin to feel joy,

668
00:28:35.684 --> 00:28:39.596
to feel elevated, to feel inspired,

669
00:28:39.596 --> 00:28:43.099
we're now conditioning the body to a new mind.

670
00:28:43.415 --> 00:28:45.963
We are literally sending a new chemical signal

671
00:28:45.963 --> 00:28:47.181
to the body.

672
00:28:47.181 --> 00:28:48.523
And if that person can get up,

673
00:28:48.523 --> 00:28:51.360
and I always say, memorize that feeling,

674
00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.503
because that's who you really are.

675
00:28:53.503 --> 00:28:54.987
You can memorize that feeling

676
00:28:54.987 --> 00:28:57.441
as well as you can memorize suffering.

677
00:28:57.441 --> 00:29:01.183
Now, this takes consistency to get there.

678
00:29:01.183 --> 00:29:03.883
You can't do it in one shot and say, "Okay, I'm healed."

679
00:29:03.883 --> 00:29:07.039
No. That could happen, but the person has to

680
00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:09.277
make up their mind severely to have that happen.

681
00:29:09.277 --> 00:29:11.263
Most of the time, we make a decision.

682
00:29:11.263 --> 00:29:14.150
You say, "I think I'm gonna change.

683
00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.262
"You know, I'll start in a couple days."

684
00:29:16.262 --> 00:29:16.955
You know, that's how we--

685
00:29:16.955 --> 00:29:17.926
<v Voiceover>I'm going on that diet.</v>

686
00:29:17.926 --> 00:29:19.164
<v ->Yeah, yeah, you know,</v>

687
00:29:19.164 --> 00:29:20.646
anyway, pass the beer nuts.

688
00:29:20.646 --> 00:29:22.119
You know, that's what people do.

689
00:29:22.119 --> 00:29:23.941
But you know when you're in crisis,

690
00:29:23.941 --> 00:29:25.936
or when you're faced with adversity,

691
00:29:25.936 --> 00:29:28.029
and you've made up your mind, that's when you say,

692
00:29:28.029 --> 00:29:29.662
"That is it.

693
00:29:30.203 --> 00:29:31.140
"I have made up my mind."

694
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.091
That's the first time your body is getting the signal,

695
00:29:33.091 --> 00:29:36.153
like, "Uh-oh, she's serious this time."

696
00:29:36.153 --> 00:29:38.265
Now mind and body start working together.

697
00:29:38.265 --> 00:29:42.704
That's the type of emphatic insistence

698
00:29:42.704 --> 00:29:44.771
that it takes for true personal change.

699
00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:47.352
But crisis is usually the mechanism that does that.

700
00:29:47.352 --> 00:29:49.306
We don't have to wait for crisis.

701
00:29:49.306 --> 00:29:51.321
We could begin to do that because we feel great

702
00:29:51.321 --> 00:29:53.283
and we're in a state of gratitude and we love our life

703
00:29:53.283 --> 00:29:55.586
and we want more great experiences.

704
00:29:55.586 --> 00:29:58.103
So then that person who's depressed,

705
00:29:58.103 --> 00:29:59.970
as they begin applying it,

706
00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:01.922
and as they begin applying that knowledge

707
00:30:01.922 --> 00:30:03.958
and they begin to do the meditation

708
00:30:03.958 --> 00:30:06.167
or do the aerobic exercise, or they begin

709
00:30:06.167 --> 00:30:09.870
to uncover the part of themselves that they've memorized,

710
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:13.773
and say, "That experience happened to me

711
00:30:13.773 --> 00:30:16.577
"20 years ago, and what I didn't know,

712
00:30:16.577 --> 00:30:18.934
"that every time I thought about that experience,

713
00:30:18.934 --> 00:30:20.864
"I was producing the same chemistry

714
00:30:20.864 --> 00:30:22.934
"as if the experience was happening."

715
00:30:22.934 --> 00:30:25.046
20 years of that is gonna condition the body

716
00:30:25.046 --> 00:30:27.042
into a depressed state.

717
00:30:27.042 --> 00:30:28.113
Now,

718
00:30:28.662 --> 00:30:30.807
does the person have to go back

719
00:30:30.807 --> 00:30:33.612
and go to the event that caused the emotion?

720
00:30:33.612 --> 00:30:34.953
No.

721
00:30:34.953 --> 00:30:38.401
All they have to do is un-memorize that emotion.

722
00:30:38.401 --> 00:30:39.744
And when they un-memorize it,

723
00:30:39.744 --> 00:30:42.261
they look back at that event and they say,

724
00:30:42.261 --> 00:30:45.098
"That event and that adversity was exactly

725
00:30:45.098 --> 00:30:48.436
"what I needed to make me who I am today."

726
00:30:48.436 --> 00:30:50.529
Now, the person who has the experience

727
00:30:50.529 --> 00:30:54.229
that has a long refractory period of emotional memory,

728
00:30:54.229 --> 00:30:57.130
that becomes who they are as a personality,

729
00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:59.689
and that person can change.

730
00:30:59.689 --> 00:31:01.780
And you say, "Why are you so needy?"

731
00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.391
Or, "Why are you so insecure?"

732
00:31:03.391 --> 00:31:07.050
They'll say, "I'm this way because of this event

733
00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:09.844
"that happened to me 20 years ago."

734
00:31:09.844 --> 00:31:12.243
Which means, "I don't know how to change,

735
00:31:12.243 --> 00:31:15.764
"or I can't change, and I'm in the same emotion

736
00:31:15.764 --> 00:31:17.587
"from the event that happened 20 years ago."

737
00:31:17.587 --> 00:31:20.168
Remember, emotions are the end product of experience.

738
00:31:20.168 --> 00:31:21.778
"So I've memorized this emotional state

739
00:31:21.778 --> 00:31:23.720
"for the last 20 years, and I don't know how to change.

740
00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.265
"So I'm gonna tell you why I am this way."

741
00:31:26.805 --> 00:31:28.389
<v Voiceover>Defending that particular limitation--</v>

742
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:30.298
<v ->We're excusing ourselves to change</v>

743
00:31:30.298 --> 00:31:31.194
because of some event--

744
00:31:31.194 --> 00:31:32.409
<v Voiceover>And it reinforces it every time.</v>

745
00:31:32.409 --> 00:31:34.127
<v ->It reinforces the identity.</v>

746
00:31:34.127 --> 00:31:36.131
So the person then has to go from thinking

747
00:31:36.131 --> 00:31:37.068
to doing to being.

748
00:31:37.068 --> 00:31:39.479
And then, when they memorize

749
00:31:39.479 --> 00:31:42.086
that new emotional state, and I've seen it happen,

750
00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:44.279
people are liberated.

751
00:31:44.279 --> 00:31:47.287
And the brain, then, upscales its neurology,

752
00:31:47.287 --> 00:31:51.087
its circuitry, and it upscales its chemistry

753
00:31:51.692 --> 00:31:53.548
to keep the person out of harm's way

754
00:31:53.548 --> 00:31:56.358
instead of going down that dark alley again.

755
00:31:57.462 --> 00:31:59.455
<v Voiceover>I like the way you use the computer model,</v>

756
00:31:59.455 --> 00:32:01.622
because it's something most people can relate to now.

757
00:32:01.622 --> 00:32:04.161
But let's move into the world of technology,

758
00:32:04.161 --> 00:32:06.965
because it's one that I feel greatly concerned about,

759
00:32:06.965 --> 00:32:08.084
on many, many levels.

760
00:32:08.084 --> 00:32:11.274
And that is, the interface of developing brains

761
00:32:11.274 --> 00:32:14.153
with technology, particularly video games,

762
00:32:14.153 --> 00:32:17.300
almost all of which are violent.

763
00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:21.118
And the ramifications of the kind of human brain,

764
00:32:21.118 --> 00:32:23.946
then, human being, that this is creating,

765
00:32:23.946 --> 00:32:25.620
and I know you've done a lot on this,

766
00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:28.318
just, please, tell us what happens there.

767
00:32:28.318 --> 00:32:29.907
<v ->Well, this is a dangerous age.</v>

768
00:32:29.907 --> 00:32:31.140
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

769
00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:36.279
<v ->You know, when children play computer games,</v>

770
00:32:37.703 --> 00:32:40.199
and they're blowing something up

771
00:32:40.199 --> 00:32:41.767
or they're shooting somebody

772
00:32:41.767 --> 00:32:43.124
or they're gunning a plane down,

773
00:32:43.124 --> 00:32:45.768
or they're busting through to the next level,

774
00:32:45.768 --> 00:32:48.082
or they're breaking a wall down,

775
00:32:48.082 --> 00:32:50.773
whatever those games do,

776
00:32:51.495 --> 00:32:54.972
what happens is, the moment that they succeed

777
00:32:54.972 --> 00:32:58.097
in overcoming whatever it is on that computer game,

778
00:32:58.097 --> 00:33:02.549
the brain produces enormous amounts of dopamine.

779
00:33:02.991 --> 00:33:05.977
Now, dopamine is the pleasure chemical.

780
00:33:07.347 --> 00:33:10.416
It stimulates the reward center in the brain.

781
00:33:10.416 --> 00:33:13.914
So the person, the kid spends an hour or two hours

782
00:33:15.444 --> 00:33:18.180
with this incredible sensory stimuli,

783
00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.761
and their brain levels of all this dopamine

784
00:33:20.761 --> 00:33:22.850
that's being produced is stimulating

785
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.085
the pleasure center in the brain.

786
00:33:25.281 --> 00:33:27.915
And if you keep doing that, the pleasure center

787
00:33:27.915 --> 00:33:30.337
recalibrates itself to a higher level.

788
00:33:30.337 --> 00:33:33.024
You need a little bit more to turn it on.

789
00:33:33.024 --> 00:33:35.744
And so, the receptor sites in the pleasure center

790
00:33:35.744 --> 00:33:38.487
are very sensitive to those chemicals.

791
00:33:38.487 --> 00:33:42.220
And if you give those receptor sites too much boost,

792
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.543
they become desensitized.

793
00:33:44.543 --> 00:33:46.421
They don't function, so you need more

794
00:33:46.421 --> 00:33:48.830
of a stronger chemistry to turn it on.

795
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:51.902
It's like living with a spouse who always yells at you.

796
00:33:51.902 --> 00:33:54.504
They have to yell a little louder to get your attention.

797
00:33:54.504 --> 00:33:56.062
Well, the brain's the same way.

798
00:33:56.062 --> 00:33:58.612
Receptor sites need a little bit more of a rush.

799
00:33:58.612 --> 00:34:01.650
So now this kid, spending two hours,

800
00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:03.784
and it's not normal to put the brain

801
00:34:03.784 --> 00:34:06.655
through two hours of that type of stimulation,

802
00:34:07.398 --> 00:34:09.713
just thrusts their pleasure center

803
00:34:09.713 --> 00:34:11.376
to a very high level.

804
00:34:11.376 --> 00:34:14.271
And now they're gonna go to school.

805
00:34:15.238 --> 00:34:18.021
Learning should be a reward in itself.

806
00:34:18.021 --> 00:34:20.720
And because they've produced such high levels

807
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:23.080
of dopamine, and even adrenaline,

808
00:34:23.683 --> 00:34:26.041
when it comes to the normal sensory stimuli

809
00:34:26.041 --> 00:34:28.461
in our environment, watching a sunset,

810
00:34:28.461 --> 00:34:30.424
taking a walk with your grampa,

811
00:34:30.424 --> 00:34:33.475
or playing with your dog, it's just not

812
00:34:33.475 --> 00:34:35.362
gonna turn on the pleasure center.

813
00:34:35.362 --> 00:34:37.293
<v Voiceover>You see kind of a slack-jawed,</v>

814
00:34:37.293 --> 00:34:40.224
disengaged look in a lot of the young kids now.

815
00:34:40.224 --> 00:34:41.994
<v ->You see this thing called adhedonia,</v>

816
00:34:41.994 --> 00:34:44.400
which, you don't get pleasure from anything.

817
00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:47.799
They're removed because their brain

818
00:34:47.799 --> 00:34:50.806
has an abnormal chemistry.

819
00:34:50.806 --> 00:34:53.485
So when learning should be a reward in itself,

820
00:34:53.485 --> 00:34:56.875
these children are unstimulated.

821
00:34:56.875 --> 00:34:58.240
So they're either falling asleep

822
00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.196
or a great way to turn the brain on

823
00:35:01.196 --> 00:35:03.009
is to act out to get in trouble.

824
00:35:03.009 --> 00:35:04.182
The moment you get in trouble,

825
00:35:04.182 --> 00:35:05.890
adenaline levels go on,

826
00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.173
you have a moment where there's heightened awareness.

827
00:35:09.173 --> 00:35:10.252
And the child doesn't know

828
00:35:10.252 --> 00:35:12.182
that they're consciously doing this.

829
00:35:12.182 --> 00:35:14.517
But they're doing something to get that same rush,

830
00:35:14.517 --> 00:35:15.883
to get that same high.

831
00:35:15.883 --> 00:35:18.277
Now, think about what happens

832
00:35:18.762 --> 00:35:21.195
10 years down the road, when this kid

833
00:35:21.195 --> 00:35:23.701
is faced with difficult situations

834
00:35:23.701 --> 00:35:26.240
because he's getting a divorce

835
00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.637
or she's lost her best friend.

836
00:35:30.153 --> 00:35:33.133
And now the body is

837
00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:36.285
in a different chemical state.

838
00:35:36.285 --> 00:35:38.984
What do we do to make it feel better?

839
00:35:38.984 --> 00:35:42.547
Instead of looking within and integrating

840
00:35:42.547 --> 00:35:45.574
different stages of grief or whatever people go through,

841
00:35:46.994 --> 00:35:49.988
they return to something in their environment

842
00:35:49.988 --> 00:35:51.620
that's gonna give them a high.

843
00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.062
And it may be drugs the next time,

844
00:35:53.062 --> 00:35:54.207
or it may be...

845
00:35:54.992 --> 00:35:56.131
<v Voiceover>How about cycles of violence</v>

846
00:35:56.131 --> 00:35:57.753
that occur as a result of being programmed

847
00:35:57.753 --> 00:36:01.305
to be excited and highly sensitized toward,

848
00:36:01.305 --> 00:36:03.545
like you say, blowing someone up in a video game?

849
00:36:03.545 --> 00:36:05.415
<v ->Well, it's called priming.</v>

850
00:36:06.073 --> 00:36:10.000
You prime the brain by repetition.

851
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:14.487
Priming is an unconscious process.

852
00:36:14.487 --> 00:36:17.047
If you take a group of people and you say to them,

853
00:36:17.047 --> 00:36:18.959
"Here's the sentences.

854
00:36:19.605 --> 00:36:21.738
"There's six words, and we want you to take five

855
00:36:21.738 --> 00:36:24.097
"of those words and put them into a sentence."

856
00:36:24.097 --> 00:36:26.635
And those words are, like, debilitated

857
00:36:26.635 --> 00:36:28.467
and tired and feeble.

858
00:36:28.467 --> 00:36:31.348
And you organize the words into a sentence.

859
00:36:31.348 --> 00:36:33.812
When they get up to hand in their paper,

860
00:36:33.812 --> 00:36:36.245
they walk hunched over and in pain.

861
00:36:36.245 --> 00:36:38.153
They don't know that they're doing that.

862
00:36:38.153 --> 00:36:40.489
It's happening below the conscious mind.

863
00:36:40.489 --> 00:36:43.208
So the brain begins to get primed in a certain way

864
00:36:43.208 --> 00:36:45.811
from this high amount of stimulation.

865
00:36:45.811 --> 00:36:48.517
And that becomes the normal.

866
00:36:48.517 --> 00:36:50.459
When that happens,

867
00:36:50.459 --> 00:36:53.020
we have lost touch with reality.

868
00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.371
<v Voiceover>Doesn't it create, though,</v>

869
00:36:55.371 --> 00:36:58.129
an ideal, perhaps, sector

870
00:36:58.129 --> 00:37:00.486
for a pool of individuals to draw from

871
00:37:00.486 --> 00:37:03.985
if you wanna have military participation, for example?

872
00:37:03.985 --> 00:37:05.339
Isn't it highly conditioned?

873
00:37:05.339 --> 00:37:07.796
<v ->Of course, because in the long run,</v>

874
00:37:08.356 --> 00:37:13.196
if you and I saw somebody get shot, for example,

875
00:37:13.434 --> 00:37:16.316
I would have a very severe reaction.

876
00:37:16.946 --> 00:37:18.236
What's called the autonomic nervous system

877
00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:19.644
would turn on and I would have

878
00:37:19.644 --> 00:37:21.865
a very severe chemical reaction.

879
00:37:22.468 --> 00:37:25.659
Well, if you condition yourself to do that enough,

880
00:37:26.167 --> 00:37:28.365
there come a moment where pulling the trigger

881
00:37:28.365 --> 00:37:30.454
doesn't produce that autonomic response.

882
00:37:30.454 --> 00:37:31.532
Now we're in big trouble.

883
00:37:31.532 --> 00:37:33.909
And the best snipers in the world are the ones

884
00:37:33.909 --> 00:37:36.002
that have no automic response.

885
00:37:36.002 --> 00:37:37.664
<v Voiceover>And we're really developing</v>

886
00:37:37.664 --> 00:37:41.077
a young species of people that could theoretically,

887
00:37:41.077 --> 00:37:42.943
under the right situation, be programmed

888
00:37:42.943 --> 00:37:44.391
toward such a thing.

889
00:37:44.391 --> 00:37:45.425
<v ->Yeah.</v>

890
00:37:45.425 --> 00:37:47.249
There's no evidence to prove that.

891
00:37:47.249 --> 00:37:49.382
But we can speculate and say,

892
00:37:49.382 --> 00:37:51.760
there's a really good possibility that,

893
00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.597
you keep pushing that pleasure center

894
00:37:53.597 --> 00:37:57.614
to a higher level, the absence of external stimulation,

895
00:37:57.614 --> 00:37:59.768
you're left with a bunch of people

896
00:37:59.768 --> 00:38:03.469
who are dependent now on things external from them.

897
00:38:03.469 --> 00:38:06.340
And so values change, morals change,

898
00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:11.705
and ultimately, we become very controllable.

899
00:38:11.705 --> 00:38:13.198
<v Voiceover>Very controlled? Exactly.</v>

900
00:38:13.198 --> 00:38:14.659
Now, what about the notion, again,

901
00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:16.389
if we're talking about a developing mind,

902
00:38:16.389 --> 00:38:17.851
and the brain doesn't fully develop

903
00:38:17.851 --> 00:38:20.539
until a little bit later in life, what, 25?

904
00:38:20.539 --> 00:38:21.221
<v ->25.</v>

905
00:38:21.221 --> 00:38:22.565
<v Voiceover>25 for the frontal cortex.</v>

906
00:38:22.565 --> 00:38:24.880
What happens when you have a person

907
00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.961
who has spent their life gaming during the times

908
00:38:27.961 --> 00:38:30.053
when we normally have our social development,

909
00:38:30.053 --> 00:38:30.959
as an example?

910
00:38:30.959 --> 00:38:32.634
Because I know this is a problem

911
00:38:32.634 --> 00:38:36.164
in the developed world today, with young people,

912
00:38:36.164 --> 00:38:38.403
the lack of being able to connect socially

913
00:38:38.403 --> 00:38:40.250
with any ease.

914
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:42.649
<v ->Well, it's already happening.</v>

915
00:38:43.859 --> 00:38:45.832
It is already happening.

916
00:38:46.798 --> 00:38:47.918
You know, they've done experiments

917
00:38:47.918 --> 00:38:49.742
where they've taken kids.

918
00:38:49.742 --> 00:38:52.704
They said, "Listen, we'll give you money, a dollar,

919
00:38:52.704 --> 00:38:54.251
"if you're playing a video game, we'll give you a dollar

920
00:38:54.251 --> 00:38:57.195
"for every time we ring a bell and you can stop."

921
00:38:57.195 --> 00:38:58.807
And they're all, like, "Oh, money, a dollar.

922
00:38:58.807 --> 00:39:00.748
"Yeah, yeah, okay, I'll do it."

923
00:39:00.748 --> 00:39:02.607
And none of them,

924
00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:05.322
zero, would stop.

925
00:39:05.322 --> 00:39:07.148
They kept saying, "Okay, one more second.

926
00:39:07.148 --> 00:39:08.330
"One more, one more."

927
00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:09.546
And they couldn't stop.

928
00:39:09.546 --> 00:39:10.751
You know, an addiction is something

929
00:39:10.751 --> 00:39:12.436
that you can't stop.

930
00:39:14.435 --> 00:39:17.871
Being able to read social cues

931
00:39:17.871 --> 00:39:20.804
in a non-verbal way, we do that all the time.

932
00:39:20.804 --> 00:39:24.093
And if we begin to become two-dimensional

933
00:39:24.654 --> 00:39:27.063
and a droid in several ways,

934
00:39:27.723 --> 00:39:31.034
the luster, I think, will be lost in life,

935
00:39:31.034 --> 00:39:35.440
because, if you're finding all this reinforcement

936
00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.362
and all this pleasure in a bunch of computer dots

937
00:39:38.362 --> 00:39:40.922
moving across a screen that your brain is interpreting

938
00:39:40.922 --> 00:39:45.479
as something pleasurable or something rewarding,

939
00:39:46.671 --> 00:39:49.747
and some of those are so unrealistic,

940
00:39:50.093 --> 00:39:53.984
that when it comes time to live in the real world,

941
00:39:53.986 --> 00:39:55.833
we become pretty inept.

942
00:39:55.833 --> 00:39:58.084
<v Voiceover>Would it almost resemble</v>

943
00:39:58.084 --> 00:40:00.398
a type of social autism?

944
00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:02.109
<v ->Sure, absolutely.</v>

945
00:40:02.607 --> 00:40:03.491
Yeah.

946
00:40:03.491 --> 00:40:04.676
<v Voiceover>That disconnect in this.</v>

947
00:40:04.676 --> 00:40:06.317
What about between adults,

948
00:40:06.317 --> 00:40:08.877
when you have adults, and another area is pornography.

949
00:40:08.877 --> 00:40:12.813
Extremely high stimulation for the dopamine response.

950
00:40:12.813 --> 00:40:15.074
What happens in relationships when you have,

951
00:40:15.074 --> 00:40:17.879
say, a lot of pornography that has been introduced

952
00:40:17.879 --> 00:40:21.276
by one or the other or both of the individuals?

953
00:40:22.082 --> 00:40:24.868
<v ->Well, as we get older,</v>

954
00:40:26.486 --> 00:40:30.436
and we live by strong emotional addictions,

955
00:40:31.381 --> 00:40:33.742
the Buddhists call it emotional attachments,

956
00:40:33.751 --> 00:40:36.450
but the more we're addicted to emotions,

957
00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:39.272
there's a gap between how we appear,

958
00:40:39.272 --> 00:40:41.577
how we present ourselves to the world,

959
00:40:41.577 --> 00:40:44.641
and how we really are, how we really feel.

960
00:40:44.641 --> 00:40:47.409
And the separation between this gap

961
00:40:47.915 --> 00:40:50.396
are the feelings that we live by every single day.

962
00:40:50.396 --> 00:40:51.879
So a person, the more addicted they are,

963
00:40:51.879 --> 00:40:52.817
the bigger the gap.

964
00:40:52.817 --> 00:40:54.866
So they present themselves,

965
00:40:54.866 --> 00:40:56.817
and they need the environment and the people

966
00:40:56.817 --> 00:40:59.110
and the places and the things they own

967
00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:00.742
and the experiences that they have.

968
00:41:00.742 --> 00:41:02.022
They need the environment to remember

969
00:41:02.022 --> 00:41:03.985
who they are as a somebody.

970
00:41:03.985 --> 00:41:06.160
But they're running from this emptiness,

971
00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.824
and they have this feeling that they don't know

972
00:41:07.824 --> 00:41:08.869
how to make go away.

973
00:41:08.869 --> 00:41:11.365
And this is pandemic in our culture.

974
00:41:11.365 --> 00:41:13.573
So midlife crisises, you buy the new car,

975
00:41:13.573 --> 00:41:15.163
you have the new relationship,

976
00:41:15.163 --> 00:41:16.666
you go to the new social club,

977
00:41:16.666 --> 00:41:18.394
you go on vacation, you go to a place,

978
00:41:18.394 --> 00:41:20.666
you have a new thing, you meet a new person,

979
00:41:20.666 --> 00:41:22.373
all of that, you're using the environment

980
00:41:22.373 --> 00:41:24.688
to try to remember who you are,

981
00:41:24.688 --> 00:41:26.149
to try to make that feeling go away.

982
00:41:26.149 --> 00:41:28.612
"I'm unimportant, I'm insignificant, I'm unhappy."

983
00:41:28.612 --> 00:41:29.606
<v Voiceover>I didn't amount to anything.</v>

984
00:41:29.606 --> 00:41:30.404
<v ->Right.</v>

985
00:41:30.404 --> 00:41:32.068
And that's the midlife crisis, because we realize

986
00:41:32.068 --> 00:41:33.753
that nobody's gonna make us happy,

987
00:41:33.753 --> 00:41:35.556
or nothing can make us happy.

988
00:41:35.556 --> 00:41:36.815
And we can pretty much predict

989
00:41:36.815 --> 00:41:38.425
how everything's gonna feel.

990
00:41:38.425 --> 00:41:40.492
So what's the use, right?

991
00:41:40.492 --> 00:41:43.703
So then a person does all those things

992
00:41:43.703 --> 00:41:45.633
and they realize none of that works.

993
00:41:45.633 --> 00:41:47.651
The next level beyond that

994
00:41:48.171 --> 00:41:49.407
are addictions.

995
00:41:49.407 --> 00:41:51.326
So, whether it's pornography,

996
00:41:51.326 --> 00:41:53.844
whether it's shopping, whether it's video gaming,

997
00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:56.339
whether it's gambling, whether it's drugs

998
00:41:56.339 --> 00:41:59.955
or alcohol or overeating, it's all the same.

999
00:41:59.955 --> 00:42:02.985
Something is gonna make that feeling go away

1000
00:42:02.985 --> 00:42:05.320
and it's gonna make it go away really fast.

1001
00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.293
But the same thing applies.

1002
00:42:07.293 --> 00:42:09.832
Takes a little bit more the next time you do it.

1003
00:42:09.832 --> 00:42:12.754
Just a little more, so the gambling stakes go up

1004
00:42:12.754 --> 00:42:15.453
to 100,000 from 75,000,

1005
00:42:15.453 --> 00:42:17.789
the shopping is maxing out two credit cards

1006
00:42:17.789 --> 00:42:18.911
and not one.

1007
00:42:18.911 --> 00:42:21.351
It's beyond conscious reason,

1008
00:42:21.351 --> 00:42:24.612
but it's making that feeling of pain and lack go away.

1009
00:42:24.612 --> 00:42:28.268
Now, that type of dependency

1010
00:42:28.268 --> 00:42:30.582
that people get lost in

1011
00:42:30.582 --> 00:42:33.635
is the best that they know how to do

1012
00:42:33.993 --> 00:42:37.182
to make that emotional feeling go away.

1013
00:42:37.182 --> 00:42:38.750
The true change is when a person

1014
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:41.267
looks at that emotion, begins to define it

1015
00:42:41.267 --> 00:42:43.080
and begins to unlearn it.

1016
00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:44.840
The person who then becomes addicted

1017
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.180
to pornography and gets that heightened

1018
00:42:48.784 --> 00:42:52.297
stimulation, over time,

1019
00:42:53.125 --> 00:42:54.447
they'll get as addicted to that

1020
00:42:54.447 --> 00:42:56.442
as they'll get addicted to alcohol.

1021
00:42:56.442 --> 00:43:00.142
And the effect of that is, is that they'll try to find

1022
00:43:00.142 --> 00:43:03.631
new and different ways to try to create

1023
00:43:05.821 --> 00:43:08.855
a new feeling in a diverse way

1024
00:43:08.855 --> 00:43:11.905
from a similar experience that they're exhausting.

1025
00:43:11.905 --> 00:43:13.847
There's only so many ways, right?

1026
00:43:13.847 --> 00:43:16.004
So you reach a limit, but they keep going

1027
00:43:16.004 --> 00:43:18.764
and pushing it to the limit, to push it to the extreme,

1028
00:43:18.764 --> 00:43:21.345
to get that thrill, right?

1029
00:43:22.475 --> 00:43:24.404
Because they don't know

1030
00:43:24.404 --> 00:43:26.857
how to make that emptiness go away.

1031
00:43:26.857 --> 00:43:29.983
And so, the end product of that over times is,

1032
00:43:29.983 --> 00:43:34.154
we find ourselves living in a very unrealistic society,

1033
00:43:34.154 --> 00:43:36.984
where we become

1034
00:43:37.438 --> 00:43:39.091
very hedonic.

1035
00:43:39.091 --> 00:43:40.936
We're pleasure seekers.

1036
00:43:42.126 --> 00:43:44.416
We tend to scan the environment

1037
00:43:44.416 --> 00:43:47.197
to move towards things that are gonna feel good,

1038
00:43:47.197 --> 00:43:48.541
that are gonna bring us comfort,

1039
00:43:48.541 --> 00:43:50.472
and move away from the things that feel bad

1040
00:43:50.472 --> 00:43:51.805
that's gonna bring us discomfort.

1041
00:43:51.805 --> 00:43:54.429
That's plain pain-pleasure stimulation,

1042
00:43:54.429 --> 00:43:57.908
very, very hedonistic

1043
00:43:57.908 --> 00:43:59.433
and very basic,

1044
00:43:59.866 --> 00:44:02.618
and it's conditioning that takes place

1045
00:44:02.618 --> 00:44:05.092
for survival in the animal kingdom.

1046
00:44:05.632 --> 00:44:07.137
But if you understood that change

1047
00:44:07.137 --> 00:44:09.290
was an uncomfortable process,

1048
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:11.339
and, in fact, you're gonna go about the process

1049
00:44:11.339 --> 00:44:13.163
of changes, is gonna make you uncomfortable,

1050
00:44:13.163 --> 00:44:14.688
what do you do then?

1051
00:44:14.688 --> 00:44:17.131
I mean, now, the moment you feel uncomfortable,

1052
00:44:17.131 --> 00:44:18.571
what do most people do?

1053
00:44:18.571 --> 00:44:20.118
They run back to the familiar

1054
00:44:20.118 --> 00:44:22.572
to try to create a new feeling that makes them feel better

1055
00:44:22.572 --> 00:44:24.725
so they can feel more like themselves.

1056
00:44:24.725 --> 00:44:26.271
So then the person never can change

1057
00:44:26.271 --> 00:44:27.978
because the moment they're left

1058
00:44:27.978 --> 00:44:30.431
with breaking that chemical continuity,

1059
00:44:30.431 --> 00:44:33.515
of thinking and feeling, of need and suffering,

1060
00:44:34.011 --> 00:44:35.228
the moment they break from that

1061
00:44:35.228 --> 00:44:37.200
and that's disrupted,

1062
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.865
the body goes into chaos.

1063
00:44:38.865 --> 00:44:41.864
And they, instead of changing,

1064
00:44:42.341 --> 00:44:43.984
they run to something that's gonna

1065
00:44:43.984 --> 00:44:45.909
make the feeling go away.

1066
00:44:46.692 --> 00:44:48.469
You can go from

1067
00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.245
gambling to pornography,

1068
00:44:50.245 --> 00:44:51.994
to drugs, to alcohol, to coffee,

1069
00:44:51.994 --> 00:44:54.125
whatever people do.

1070
00:44:54.125 --> 00:44:56.108
But the real reason they're doing it

1071
00:44:56.108 --> 00:44:59.181
is because there's some terrible feeling

1072
00:44:59.181 --> 00:45:02.258
that they don't know how to make go away.

1073
00:45:02.689 --> 00:45:05.293
<v Voiceover>So let's take a hypothetical or not.</v>

1074
00:45:05.293 --> 00:45:07.799
We have an economy that is

1075
00:45:07.799 --> 00:45:09.762
definitely in a severe downturn.

1076
00:45:09.762 --> 00:45:12.350
And there are indications it could go much further down.

1077
00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:14.578
Let's just say that a lot of those options

1078
00:45:14.578 --> 00:45:17.832
to be fed externally and hedonistically

1079
00:45:17.832 --> 00:45:19.719
simply dry up because we don't have the means

1080
00:45:19.719 --> 00:45:21.767
to procure them, for example.

1081
00:45:21.767 --> 00:45:23.474
What would you expect to see

1082
00:45:23.474 --> 00:45:26.482
where you have this happening en masse

1083
00:45:26.482 --> 00:45:28.155
in a culture?

1084
00:45:28.155 --> 00:45:30.930
<v ->I think it's obvious you're gonna see a lot of chaos.</v>

1085
00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:34.088
And you're gonna see, just like anybody

1086
00:45:34.088 --> 00:45:36.092
who can't get their fix,

1087
00:45:36.092 --> 00:45:39.633
you're gonna see people acting in unreasonable ways.

1088
00:45:39.633 --> 00:45:41.723
They don't know that they're doing that,

1089
00:45:41.723 --> 00:45:44.444
but they're not getting the rush

1090
00:45:44.444 --> 00:45:47.536
that they could get from some external stimulation,

1091
00:45:47.536 --> 00:45:49.425
from some type of computer program

1092
00:45:49.425 --> 00:45:51.494
or some type of game, or some type of--

1093
00:45:51.494 --> 00:45:53.471
<v Voiceover>Or a new car, even, or whatever.</v>

1094
00:45:53.471 --> 00:45:57.018
<v ->Comfort, convenience, consumerism,</v>

1095
00:45:57.018 --> 00:45:59.237
capitalism, all the c's.

1096
00:45:59.915 --> 00:46:03.000
When we begin to take those away from us,

1097
00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:06.890
yeah, you're left with values.

1098
00:46:07.534 --> 00:46:10.435
Those people who have become so dependent

1099
00:46:10.435 --> 00:46:12.609
are gonna find themselves either shaping up

1100
00:46:12.609 --> 00:46:15.352
really quickly or losing control.

1101
00:46:15.352 --> 00:46:16.694
<v Voiceover>So the best way to approach it</v>

1102
00:46:16.694 --> 00:46:19.046
and to kind of take it head on now,

1103
00:46:19.046 --> 00:46:21.444
and regain our humanity,

1104
00:46:21.887 --> 00:46:24.116
again, is it, go back to knowing thyself?

1105
00:46:24.116 --> 00:46:25.568
Does it go back to meditation?

1106
00:46:25.568 --> 00:46:28.404
What's your prescription for that, Doctor Joe?

1107
00:46:28.404 --> 00:46:29.854
(Joe laughs)

1108
00:46:29.854 --> 00:46:32.761
<v ->Well, you know,</v>

1109
00:46:33.973 --> 00:46:35.448
when we live

1110
00:46:36.254 --> 00:46:39.626
believing in something outside of us

1111
00:46:39.626 --> 00:46:41.609
that's gonna make us happy,

1112
00:46:41.609 --> 00:46:44.360
and we try to accumulate possessions

1113
00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.344
and materialism to do that,

1114
00:46:46.344 --> 00:46:49.400
all of that just reinforces the ego.

1115
00:46:49.917 --> 00:46:52.466
When we live by the chemicals of survival,

1116
00:46:52.466 --> 00:46:55.262
which most people do, all day long,

1117
00:46:55.262 --> 00:46:59.497
that chemicals produce aggression and anger

1118
00:46:59.497 --> 00:47:03.480
and fear and anxiety and pain and suffering

1119
00:47:04.019 --> 00:47:07.070
and vigilance and all the variations

1120
00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:09.094
of those chemicals.

1121
00:47:09.094 --> 00:47:12.060
It's those chemicals that cause us to put

1122
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.666
all of our tension on our bodies,

1123
00:47:15.023 --> 00:47:17.829
to become super aware of the environment,

1124
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:19.578
and very concerned about time.

1125
00:47:19.578 --> 00:47:20.816
No different than an animal

1126
00:47:20.816 --> 00:47:22.703
that's being chased by a predator.

1127
00:47:22.703 --> 00:47:24.271
Certain amount of time to get out of here,

1128
00:47:24.271 --> 00:47:27.080
I better protect the self.

1129
00:47:27.684 --> 00:47:29.614
And I gotta do it in a certain amount of time

1130
00:47:29.614 --> 00:47:31.118
and I gotta look in the environment

1131
00:47:31.118 --> 00:47:33.561
and get super aware of which way I'm gonna go.

1132
00:47:33.561 --> 00:47:36.363
And I got a rush of adrenaline to do that.

1133
00:47:36.363 --> 00:47:39.446
Well, people live by those chemicals all day long

1134
00:47:39.446 --> 00:47:41.468
unconsciously because

1135
00:47:42.518 --> 00:47:44.587
we can expect an event to happen,

1136
00:47:44.587 --> 00:47:47.937
we can anticipate something to occur.

1137
00:47:47.937 --> 00:47:49.505
And when we get it right, we pat ourselves

1138
00:47:49.505 --> 00:47:51.168
on the shoulder and we say,

1139
00:47:51.168 --> 00:47:52.854
"Did you see me, how smart I was?"

1140
00:47:52.854 --> 00:47:57.122
But what happens when you're anticipating an event

1141
00:47:57.132 --> 00:47:59.006
and it doesn't happen?

1142
00:47:59.006 --> 00:48:01.096
That's called anxiety, that's called depression,

1143
00:48:01.096 --> 00:48:02.984
that's called obsessive compulsive disorder,

1144
00:48:02.984 --> 00:48:05.896
that's called anxiety, it's called insomnia.

1145
00:48:05.896 --> 00:48:08.307
And we can turn on the stress response

1146
00:48:08.307 --> 00:48:10.707
just by thought alone.

1147
00:48:10.707 --> 00:48:12.434
And we turn on the stress response

1148
00:48:12.434 --> 00:48:14.632
and we can't turn it off.

1149
00:48:14.632 --> 00:48:18.294
Now we're headed for dis-ease, imbalance.

1150
00:48:19.953 --> 00:48:22.471
Those, redundancy of those chemicals

1151
00:48:22.471 --> 00:48:26.148
over time disregulate or down regulate

1152
00:48:26.148 --> 00:48:29.041
the genes in the body that create disease.

1153
00:48:29.783 --> 00:48:31.916
So the other state of mind that we live in

1154
00:48:31.916 --> 00:48:33.975
is called creation.

1155
00:48:33.975 --> 00:48:36.812
Now, in creation, when you're truly in creation,

1156
00:48:36.812 --> 00:48:38.828
you forget about yourself.

1157
00:48:38.828 --> 00:48:40.428
There is no self anymore.

1158
00:48:40.428 --> 00:48:41.302
You're no thing.

1159
00:48:41.302 --> 00:48:44.331
There's no thing, there's no time, there's no body.

1160
00:48:44.331 --> 00:48:46.059
You're so involved with what you're doing

1161
00:48:46.059 --> 00:48:47.948
that the thought becomes the experience

1162
00:48:47.948 --> 00:48:49.614
in and of itself.

1163
00:48:50.217 --> 00:48:53.321
So, a good example to know if a person's living

1164
00:48:53.321 --> 00:48:55.945
in survival is, they're very self-involved.

1165
00:48:55.945 --> 00:48:57.331
They're thinking about themselves,

1166
00:48:57.331 --> 00:48:58.920
they're talking about their problems.

1167
00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:02.663
That's what keeps a person

1168
00:49:02.663 --> 00:49:04.114
performing the same actions

1169
00:49:04.114 --> 00:49:05.308
and thinking the same thoughts

1170
00:49:05.308 --> 00:49:07.686
and expecting something to change in their life.

1171
00:49:07.686 --> 00:49:10.513
Because those chemicals bring us back

1172
00:49:10.513 --> 00:49:13.372
to very primitive actions, and they activate

1173
00:49:13.372 --> 00:49:15.462
those circuits for that.

1174
00:49:15.462 --> 00:49:18.939
Whether it's war or competition or politics,

1175
00:49:18.939 --> 00:49:22.473
it's all just a different version of those chemicals.

1176
00:49:23.301 --> 00:49:26.878
The true state of creation involves

1177
00:49:28.428 --> 00:49:30.574
a new set of chemicals that has to do

1178
00:49:30.574 --> 00:49:33.518
with being inspired and being joyful

1179
00:49:33.518 --> 00:49:36.345
and being lifted and having an elevated mood.

1180
00:49:37.235 --> 00:49:39.980
You're not gonna find it in the environment.

1181
00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:41.612
You're gonna find it within you,

1182
00:49:41.612 --> 00:49:44.893
in my present state of ignorance.

1183
00:49:44.893 --> 00:49:47.496
And, as far as I've evolved as a human being,

1184
00:49:47.496 --> 00:49:50.451
I can say when I've had those moments,

1185
00:49:50.451 --> 00:49:54.312
where I found that I was joyful for no reason

1186
00:49:54.312 --> 00:49:56.200
and it was within me, and I didn't need

1187
00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.389
anyone or anything, and I enjoyed my own company

1188
00:49:59.389 --> 00:50:02.550
and my own mind, I'm more prone

1189
00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:05.314
to be selfless in those moments.

1190
00:50:06.878 --> 00:50:09.128
When we eliminate the barriers, the blocks

1191
00:50:09.128 --> 00:50:12.093
of those emotional states of mind

1192
00:50:12.093 --> 00:50:14.985
that keep us reinforcing the ego,

1193
00:50:14.985 --> 00:50:18.824
we take the ego apart, we break down the identity,

1194
00:50:18.824 --> 00:50:21.746
there'll be moments where the light shines through,

1195
00:50:21.746 --> 00:50:23.858
where it begins to bleed through

1196
00:50:23.858 --> 00:50:26.951
and you begin to take on the characteristics

1197
00:50:26.951 --> 00:50:29.180
of that power within us, that greater mind,

1198
00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:31.646
and you tend to be joyful and generous

1199
00:50:31.646 --> 00:50:33.497
and selfless,

1200
00:50:33.497 --> 00:50:37.060
and loving and contributing

1201
00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:39.315
and inspired and patient.

1202
00:50:39.315 --> 00:50:41.694
That's the qualities of that mind.

1203
00:50:41.694 --> 00:50:45.773
And so, I think that our true mission in life

1204
00:50:46.353 --> 00:50:50.304
is to express that power within us through us,

1205
00:50:50.704 --> 00:50:54.021
to eliminate the barriers and the blocks.

1206
00:50:54.021 --> 00:50:55.794
And when we do that,

1207
00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:59.213
there's a greater tendency for us,

1208
00:50:59.213 --> 00:51:01.837
in our selfless nature, to take on

1209
00:51:01.837 --> 00:51:04.509
some of those unlimited qualities

1210
00:51:04.509 --> 00:51:08.022
that this world needs in order for it to change.

1211
00:51:09.512 --> 00:51:11.484
