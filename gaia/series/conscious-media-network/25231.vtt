1
00:00:00.585 --> 00:00:04.873
(mellow instrumental music)

2
00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:14.401
<v ->There's been a seeming missing link</v>

3
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:16.534
between Zecharia Sitchin's interpretation

4
00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:19.337
of the Sumerian Tablets and physical evidence

5
00:00:19.337 --> 00:00:21.907
of the alleged gold mining clone species

6
00:00:21.907 --> 00:00:23.208
of the Anunnaki.

7
00:00:23.208 --> 00:00:24.542
That is until now.

8
00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:26.811
Micheal Tellinger and his partner Johan Heine

9
00:00:26.811 --> 00:00:30.215
have brought an ancient civilization in South Africa

10
00:00:30.215 --> 00:00:32.350
to the center of Sitchin's thesis.

11
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.722
Spanning thousands of kilometers in distance

12
00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:37.756
and up to 280,000 years in time,

13
00:00:37.756 --> 00:00:40.325
these structures now appear to be way more

14
00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:42.711
than just housing for mine workers.

15
00:00:55.807 --> 00:00:58.343
<v Regina>We spoke once before in a radio interview</v>

16
00:00:58.343 --> 00:01:00.078
and laid some of the foundation for what

17
00:01:00.078 --> 00:01:01.146
we'll talk about today.

18
00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:05.820
But I've noticed with your work, you're really about

19
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.054
connecting much larger dots than just this particular piece

20
00:01:09.054 --> 00:01:10.955
that you've been working on for the last many years

21
00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:12.290
and continue to work on.

22
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.293
Which means we're going to have two conversations today.

23
00:01:15.293 --> 00:01:17.061
One is going to be on the ancient ruins

24
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:20.632
and the implications in terms of modern technology.

25
00:01:20.632 --> 00:01:23.435
And then we're going to have a second conversation,

26
00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:25.571
with your permission, about the extension

27
00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:28.239
of what this means to modern society,

28
00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:29.707
and some of what you're thinking about

29
00:01:29.707 --> 00:01:33.377
and having the works for South Africa in particular.

30
00:01:33.377 --> 00:01:35.746
So let's have conversation one first,

31
00:01:35.746 --> 00:01:37.215
which is really amazing.

32
00:01:37.215 --> 00:01:39.850
You're startling groups all over the United States

33
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.258
on this 26 city tour showing them your findings

34
00:01:43.258 --> 00:01:45.591
on these ancient ruins in South Africa,

35
00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:49.928
which indicate, it appears to be the very earliest signs

36
00:01:49.928 --> 00:01:52.830
of what it now known as modern human,

37
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.699
the modern human.

38
00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:57.870
Let's just go ahead and launch into the beginning.

39
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.704
And we'll kind of keep that compact and listen

40
00:01:59.704 --> 00:02:01.240
to the radio interview.

41
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.642
Let's keep that part compact, but talk about how

42
00:02:03.642 --> 00:02:05.910
you stumbled upon this, and what your initial interest was

43
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.647
in these South African ruins.

44
00:02:08.647 --> 00:02:10.815
<v ->Thanks, Regina.</v>

45
00:02:10.815 --> 00:02:13.919
My interest in the ruins really started

46
00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:18.023
from the very early age where I've always been interested

47
00:02:18.023 --> 00:02:21.359
in life in the universe.

48
00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.595
Looking up at the skies as an early, very young child,

49
00:02:24.595 --> 00:02:26.697
wondering what the other people looked like

50
00:02:26.697 --> 00:02:28.599
that lived out there in the sky.

51
00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.137
I never ever thought that we were the only people on Earth

52
00:02:32.137 --> 00:02:34.073
and lost in the universe.

53
00:02:34.073 --> 00:02:38.376
That came as a surprise to me when suddenly I was told

54
00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:42.213
by other adults that oh no, we're the only people

55
00:02:42.213 --> 00:02:44.516
that are out there in this vast universe.

56
00:02:44.516 --> 00:02:45.684
That was a big shock to me.

57
00:02:45.684 --> 00:02:49.521
And even as a young child I just never could relate to that.

58
00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:54.521
Then later I started being involved, or interested in

59
00:02:54.893 --> 00:02:57.529
these so-called mythological creatures

60
00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:01.633
and mythological gods as a teenager, early teenager.

61
00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:04.405
And in my musical days I started writing songs

62
00:03:04.405 --> 00:03:07.639
about these mythological gods, about every possible god

63
00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.274
you can image.

64
00:03:09.274 --> 00:03:11.846
So already for some strange reason I was attracted

65
00:03:11.846 --> 00:03:15.981
to that side of history, and the mystery of the origins

66
00:03:15.981 --> 00:03:17.654
of humankind.

67
00:03:17.654 --> 00:03:22.320
Very shortly after that in high school and at university,

68
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.793
I then started reading the material in the books

69
00:03:24.793 --> 00:03:26.725
that were available on this starting with obvious,

70
00:03:26.725 --> 00:03:28.427
Erich von Daniken.

71
00:03:28.427 --> 00:03:31.863
And then I discovered Immanuel Velikovsky

72
00:03:31.863 --> 00:03:34.499
and that was like a big shock to the system.

73
00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.970
And then obviously much later I stumbled upon

74
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.571
Zecharia Sitchin and also the wonderful book

75
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:43.174
by William Bramley, Gods of Eden,

76
00:03:43.174 --> 00:03:45.243
which is a wonderful piece of work.

77
00:03:45.243 --> 00:03:47.117
And I realized that there's this whole body

78
00:03:47.117 --> 00:03:49.347
of information out there and lots

79
00:03:49.347 --> 00:03:51.383
of wonderful authors and researchers,

80
00:03:51.383 --> 00:03:56.383
and men of amazing research.

81
00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.489
And people that have got high stature in communities

82
00:04:04.162 --> 00:04:07.465
have been working on this for a long, long time

83
00:04:07.465 --> 00:04:09.367
that have been sharing this information,

84
00:04:09.367 --> 00:04:12.483
but it's been somehow hidden.

85
00:04:12.483 --> 00:04:16.675
That really brought me to write Slave Species of God.

86
00:04:16.675 --> 00:04:20.745
I realized that there was an opportunity

87
00:04:20.745 --> 00:04:23.481
to bring a lot of this information together

88
00:04:23.481 --> 00:04:27.819
in a slightly more palatable way than some

89
00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.188
of the more technical presentations.

90
00:04:30.188 --> 00:04:32.160
<v Regina>Yes, some of it's a little thick to get through.</v>

91
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.026
<v ->Yeah, one of the things that happened to me</v>

92
00:04:35.026 --> 00:04:39.130
was that I was sharing the information

93
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.466
about Zecharia Sitchin and his work and so forth,

94
00:04:41.466 --> 00:04:43.468
and people just weren't getting it.

95
00:04:43.468 --> 00:04:46.105
My friend said to me over lunch one day,

96
00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:48.873
he said listen, you should write a book about this.

97
00:04:48.873 --> 00:04:50.541
And I woke up the next morning and that's exactly

98
00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:53.078
what I did, I started writing Slave Species of God.

99
00:04:53.078 --> 00:04:54.713
<v Regina>But you also started writing some other things</v>

100
00:04:54.713 --> 00:04:55.947
at a very early age.

101
00:04:55.947 --> 00:04:57.582
And I just want to backtrack a bit.

102
00:04:57.582 --> 00:04:59.417
If you're comfortable, you tell me.

103
00:04:59.417 --> 00:05:01.953
Sharing a little piece you wrote when you were

104
00:05:01.953 --> 00:05:03.454
five years old-ish?

105
00:05:03.454 --> 00:05:05.789
Because this really shows who you are.

106
00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.366
And it indicates that you were born to do exactly

107
00:05:08.366 --> 00:05:09.297
what you are doing right now,

108
00:05:09.297 --> 00:05:11.630
which I find often when I sit across from people

109
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.064
that I interview.

110
00:05:13.064 --> 00:05:16.367
Is you can see, this person was born to do this very thing.

111
00:05:16.367 --> 00:05:19.270
Would you mind sharing that, because I find it fascinating.

112
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.973
<v ->I don't mind sharing it at all.</v>

113
00:05:21.973 --> 00:05:24.609
I grew up in a musical family and music,

114
00:05:24.609 --> 00:05:26.845
it's just, it's in my blood, it's in my genes,

115
00:05:26.845 --> 00:05:28.715
it's in my soul.

116
00:05:28.715 --> 00:05:31.082
And I was surrounded by people doing opera

117
00:05:31.082 --> 00:05:33.351
and jazz and doing all kinds of things.

118
00:05:33.351 --> 00:05:35.853
So musical intruments, and especially a piano,

119
00:05:35.853 --> 00:05:37.923
was always in the house.

120
00:05:37.923 --> 00:05:40.925
So I was playing piano since a very early age.

121
00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:44.529
And at the age of five, I think I couldn't have been

122
00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:45.897
more than five.

123
00:05:45.897 --> 00:05:48.172
I sat down at the piano and I wrote a song,

124
00:05:48.172 --> 00:05:50.868
because that's what everybody else was doing around me.

125
00:05:50.868 --> 00:05:53.005
So it just came naturally.

126
00:05:53.005 --> 00:05:56.407
And the song was, the lyrics were basically

127
00:05:56.407 --> 00:06:00.611
something to the extent that when you die

128
00:06:00.611 --> 00:06:03.848
you go to a place called heaven.

129
00:06:03.848 --> 00:06:07.352
But it's not really the kind of place that most people

130
00:06:07.352 --> 00:06:08.587
think it is.

131
00:06:08.587 --> 00:06:10.688
And they make specific bread there.

132
00:06:10.688 --> 00:06:12.823
But the bread is not made from flour,

133
00:06:12.823 --> 00:06:15.360
it's made from some other kind of material

134
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.164
that is a plant-like substance but is some strange

135
00:06:20.164 --> 00:06:21.732
organic plant-like substance,

136
00:06:21.732 --> 00:06:24.402
and that's the bread of heaven.

137
00:06:24.402 --> 00:06:26.705
And that's not a normal kind of thing for a five-year

138
00:06:26.705 --> 00:06:27.709
old child to do.

139
00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Regina>No, I think it's fair to say.</v>

140
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.610
So your connections with the heavens goes certainly back

141
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.945
probably before birth.

142
00:06:33.945 --> 00:06:35.980
So I just wanted you to share that just to show

143
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.850
how deep it goes because I love that little story.

144
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.052
Now we can go back forward to you wrote

145
00:06:41.052 --> 00:06:42.320
Slave Species of the Gods.

146
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.357
And at this time, now when you wrote that how aware

147
00:06:46.357 --> 00:06:49.827
were you of the artifacts that were around you?

148
00:06:49.827 --> 00:06:52.863
And can you give us the lineage of that until we get

149
00:06:52.863 --> 00:06:54.266
to Temples of the God?

150
00:06:54.266 --> 00:06:56.101
And Temples of the African Gods.

151
00:06:56.101 --> 00:06:58.402
<v ->When I started writing Slave Species of God</v>

152
00:06:58.402 --> 00:07:00.974
I was not aware at all of any of the things

153
00:07:00.974 --> 00:07:03.074
that were awaiting me.

154
00:07:03.074 --> 00:07:05.109
And that was a big surprise.

155
00:07:05.109 --> 00:07:09.181
I was just really compelled to take a lot of that

156
00:07:09.181 --> 00:07:11.249
technical information that's out there

157
00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:13.785
that I know a lot of people struggle to read.

158
00:07:13.785 --> 00:07:16.154
And the more I try to tell them about Zecharia Sitchin

159
00:07:16.154 --> 00:07:18.422
and the other literature out there, they say yeah,

160
00:07:18.422 --> 00:07:20.290
we tried to read it but I can't read it.

161
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.827
It's too difficult, I don't understand it.

162
00:07:21.827 --> 00:07:23.727
And I thought, but it's not that difficult.

163
00:07:23.727 --> 00:07:26.665
So I thought, okay let me give this a shot.

164
00:07:26.665 --> 00:07:27.766
<v Regina>And give us a synopsis now</v>

165
00:07:27.766 --> 00:07:29.567
of what that book was about.

166
00:07:29.567 --> 00:07:31.739
<v ->The Slave Species of God is really taking</v>

167
00:07:31.739 --> 00:07:35.707
writing it in laymen's terms and dealing

168
00:07:35.707 --> 00:07:39.810
with the basics of human anatomy.

169
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.447
The brain, the cells, the genome,

170
00:07:43.447 --> 00:07:45.217
and things like that.

171
00:07:45.217 --> 00:07:47.785
Everything about our body so that we understand

172
00:07:47.785 --> 00:07:48.987
what we're talking about.

173
00:07:48.987 --> 00:07:51.089
And then with genetics and cloning,

174
00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:52.123
how far we've come with cloning.

175
00:07:52.123 --> 00:07:54.592
And then going into the Sumerian Tablets

176
00:07:54.592 --> 00:07:57.228
and translating and pulling together the essence

177
00:07:57.228 --> 00:07:59.264
of the translations of the Sumerian Tablets,

178
00:07:59.264 --> 00:08:02.333
referring to the Anunnaki and the cloning process

179
00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:04.373
that they describe in the Sumerian Tablets.

180
00:08:04.373 --> 00:08:06.770
So by the time you get to the cloning process

181
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.173
and what they did a long time ago,

182
00:08:09.173 --> 00:08:11.843
you're not taking the reader and dumping them

183
00:08:11.843 --> 00:08:13.111
in the deep end.

184
00:08:13.111 --> 00:08:15.714
You've made them comfortable giving them

185
00:08:15.714 --> 00:08:18.162
laymen's terms explanation,

186
00:08:18.162 --> 00:08:23.162
and also pulling together the origins of all religions.

187
00:08:23.537 --> 00:08:26.324
I think I looked at 12 major religions

188
00:08:26.324 --> 00:08:27.958
in Slave Species of God.

189
00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.094
And I pulled them all together and showed people

190
00:08:30.094 --> 00:08:33.698
that the origins all come from the same place.

191
00:08:33.698 --> 00:08:36.434
And the point of departure in all religions,

192
00:08:36.434 --> 00:08:41.434
there's this meddling and involvement of these ancient gods

193
00:08:41.573 --> 00:08:44.408
that all mythologies and all oral traditions

194
00:08:44.408 --> 00:08:46.244
and Sumerian Tablets...

195
00:08:46.244 --> 00:08:48.112
<v Regina>Virtually every indigenous culture</v>

196
00:08:48.112 --> 00:08:48.879
speaks of this.

197
00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:51.216
The gods from the skies who come and teach them things.

198
00:08:51.216 --> 00:08:53.857
<v ->Exactly, so they come out of the sky,</v>

199
00:08:53.857 --> 00:08:56.354
they create humanity, and they teach them everything

200
00:08:56.354 --> 00:08:58.589
they need to know and then they go away.

201
00:08:58.589 --> 00:09:00.358
And they come every now and them to check up on them,

202
00:09:00.358 --> 00:09:03.194
and beat some of them up, and slap them around

203
00:09:03.194 --> 00:09:04.963
a little bit if they're misbehaving,

204
00:09:04.963 --> 00:09:08.401
and give them some more knowledge and other stuff.

205
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:09.768
And then they go away again.

206
00:09:09.768 --> 00:09:12.670
And this is the story of human history.

207
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.238
<v Regina>Now, you say human history.</v>

208
00:09:14.238 --> 00:09:15.406
And you make this distinction.

209
00:09:15.406 --> 00:09:17.407
When you do your presentation you talk about the word

210
00:09:17.407 --> 00:09:19.744
mythology as opposed to the word history

211
00:09:19.744 --> 00:09:22.547
and the actual roots of the word mythology.

212
00:09:22.547 --> 00:09:24.215
Because most people listening to this,

213
00:09:24.215 --> 00:09:26.350
they're not already familiar with the subject,

214
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.419
will say well that's part of mythology.

215
00:09:28.419 --> 00:09:30.188
It's mythological in nature.

216
00:09:30.188 --> 00:09:33.090
So, give us the definition, the roots of mythology.

217
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.961
<v ->Yeah, this is a very important distinction.</v>

218
00:09:35.961 --> 00:09:38.763
I'm glad you brought it up because what we understand

219
00:09:38.763 --> 00:09:41.332
mythology to be today and mean today

220
00:09:41.332 --> 00:09:44.169
is completely the opposite to its original meaning.

221
00:09:44.169 --> 00:09:47.038
The original meaning of the word mythos means

222
00:09:47.038 --> 00:09:49.342
words, spoken words, stories, legends,

223
00:09:49.342 --> 00:09:53.645
told by an history and they were sworn to be true

224
00:09:53.645 --> 00:09:55.412
by priests and kings.

225
00:09:55.412 --> 00:09:58.516
So we're dealing with factual events

226
00:09:58.516 --> 00:10:00.251
that were sworn to be true.

227
00:10:00.251 --> 00:10:03.522
So, what the word mythos actually means is

228
00:10:03.522 --> 00:10:07.391
and accurate representation of historic events.

229
00:10:07.391 --> 00:10:10.294
It's got nothing to do with imaginary or fairy tale,

230
00:10:10.294 --> 00:10:12.163
or stuff made up.

231
00:10:12.163 --> 00:10:14.899
Because even just when you think about that concept,

232
00:10:14.899 --> 00:10:17.702
the fact, the meaning that we ascribe to the word

233
00:10:17.702 --> 00:10:22.607
mythology today is so arrogant from our civilization

234
00:10:22.607 --> 00:10:25.076
right now because the moment we suggest

235
00:10:25.076 --> 00:10:29.314
that mythology means imaginary or fairy tale,

236
00:10:29.314 --> 00:10:33.351
that suggests that all ancient civilizations had no history.

237
00:10:33.351 --> 00:10:34.919
They imagined everything.

238
00:10:34.919 --> 00:10:37.855
Because that's what we ascribe, the value we ascribe

239
00:10:37.855 --> 00:10:40.558
to the meaning mythology.

240
00:10:40.558 --> 00:10:43.394
So what I like to suggest to people is

241
00:10:43.394 --> 00:10:46.097
every time they read the word mythology

242
00:10:46.097 --> 00:10:48.466
they must replace it with its original meaning.

243
00:10:48.466 --> 00:10:50.535
And that meaning is history.

244
00:10:50.535 --> 00:10:52.003
And suddenly everything changes.

245
00:10:52.003 --> 00:10:53.646
<v Regina>It changes in flash.</v>

246
00:10:53.646 --> 00:10:56.073
So right now, everyone listening to this conversation,

247
00:10:56.073 --> 00:10:59.678
watching this video, let's take what you're saying

248
00:10:59.678 --> 00:11:03.649
as history, genuine human history,

249
00:11:03.649 --> 00:11:06.317
perhaps a name change along the way.

250
00:11:06.317 --> 00:11:09.420
Some of the characters, it seems their names may

251
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.254
have morphed throughout history,

252
00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:13.891
But you had this similar cast of characters

253
00:11:13.891 --> 00:11:16.060
in the beginning that seems to be common

254
00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.129
to these various indigenous cultures.

255
00:11:18.129 --> 00:11:20.170
They just have their name for them.

256
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.575
So let's just say we have a cast of characters.

257
00:11:22.575 --> 00:11:24.268
And this is our historical roots.

258
00:11:24.268 --> 00:11:29.268
So now, introduce us to the historical

259
00:11:30.508 --> 00:11:34.112
creators of the human race as the indigenous species

260
00:11:34.112 --> 00:11:37.214
particularly in South Africa understand it.

261
00:11:37.214 --> 00:11:39.784
<v ->Well, the oldest written record we have</v>

262
00:11:39.784 --> 00:11:42.220
are the translations of the Sumerian Tablets.

263
00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.488
They are scripts, obviously that exist.

264
00:11:44.488 --> 00:11:48.293
But we haven't really transcribed them

265
00:11:48.293 --> 00:11:50.097
or understood them, so we can't read

266
00:11:50.097 --> 00:11:53.064
and we can't understand what they're trying to tell us.

267
00:11:53.064 --> 00:11:55.066
But we do understand what the Sumerian Tablets

268
00:11:55.066 --> 00:11:56.935
are telling us.

269
00:11:56.935 --> 00:11:59.603
Many of the interpretations have been questioned.

270
00:11:59.603 --> 00:12:02.774
However, I think the volume of the translations

271
00:12:02.774 --> 00:12:05.243
and the constant repetition and the cross-references

272
00:12:05.243 --> 00:12:08.580
in the Sumerian Tablets to the same set of events

273
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.514
and the same group of beings that were doing

274
00:12:10.514 --> 00:12:13.351
the same things all over the world suggest

275
00:12:13.351 --> 00:12:15.953
that this was really going on.

276
00:12:15.953 --> 00:12:17.521
And I don't think there should be any doubt.

277
00:12:17.521 --> 00:12:19.357
Just like we capture things today,

278
00:12:19.357 --> 00:12:21.993
the Sumerians captured things in great detail

279
00:12:21.993 --> 00:12:23.628
in ancient times.

280
00:12:23.628 --> 00:12:26.430
Except writing it on computers that could disappear

281
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.301
in a puff as we know, they captured the information

282
00:12:30.301 --> 00:12:31.302
on clay tables.

283
00:12:31.302 --> 00:12:33.937
So fortunately, we still have that information.

284
00:12:33.937 --> 00:12:36.575
If we had to evaporate today,

285
00:12:36.575 --> 00:12:38.209
there'd be absolute, very little information

286
00:12:38.209 --> 00:12:40.178
about our civilization right now.

287
00:12:40.178 --> 00:12:41.279
<v Regina>No stone carvings.</v>

288
00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:43.648
<v ->Exactly, no stone carvings, none of that.</v>

289
00:12:43.648 --> 00:12:47.342
So we wouldn't exist in the eyes of future generations

290
00:12:47.342 --> 00:12:51.323
that discovered remnants of our existence.

291
00:12:51.323 --> 00:12:52.990
Fortunately, that's not the case.

292
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.159
The Sumerian Tablets talk extensively

293
00:12:55.159 --> 00:12:59.430
about the origins of humankind.

294
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.867
They talk about a time before time,

295
00:13:01.867 --> 00:13:03.400
which is very interesting.

296
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.374
And they talk about the group of beings called the Anunnaki

297
00:13:06.374 --> 00:13:09.307
who found Earth for a specific purpose.

298
00:13:09.307 --> 00:13:11.642
The found that Earth contained gold.

299
00:13:11.642 --> 00:13:14.044
And they were desperately in need of gold,

300
00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:17.582
and therefore they came to this planet to get gold.

301
00:13:17.582 --> 00:13:20.685
At that stage, the planet may have been inhabited

302
00:13:20.685 --> 00:13:23.187
by some spiritual beings and some other

303
00:13:23.187 --> 00:13:26.723
advanced beings that may have been totally decimated.

304
00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:28.592
That becomes a whole different story.

305
00:13:28.592 --> 00:13:29.593
<v Regina>Okay, so what we're going to do</v>

306
00:13:29.593 --> 00:13:32.563
is remove the whole concept of the lost cultures

307
00:13:32.563 --> 00:13:34.999
of say, Lemuria, that seem to have risen

308
00:13:34.999 --> 00:13:37.868
throughout history to human consciousness.

309
00:13:37.868 --> 00:13:40.905
Let's take that off the table, Atlantis off the table

310
00:13:40.905 --> 00:13:44.441
and we'll just go starting with what the indications

311
00:13:44.441 --> 00:13:46.477
historically are here in terms

312
00:13:46.477 --> 00:13:48.982
of archaeological evidence and lore.

313
00:13:48.982 --> 00:13:52.853
<v ->So these Anunnaki found this planet.</v>

314
00:13:52.853 --> 00:13:56.019
They found it was rich in gold which is what they needed.

315
00:13:56.019 --> 00:13:58.064
And they came and they started mining gold

316
00:13:58.064 --> 00:14:02.793
and taking it to their planet for really survival

317
00:14:02.793 --> 00:14:05.495
of their own planet and their own species.

318
00:14:05.495 --> 00:14:07.331
They desperately needed, they decided that

319
00:14:07.331 --> 00:14:10.635
that was the thing that could help save their planet

320
00:14:10.635 --> 00:14:13.904
from environmental disaster, cosmic rays,

321
00:14:13.904 --> 00:14:15.172
and stuff like that.

322
00:14:15.172 --> 00:14:16.073
<v Regina>And do the Sumerian texts go</v>

323
00:14:16.073 --> 00:14:19.213
into any detail about what they feel this was needed for

324
00:14:19.213 --> 00:14:20.311
by the Anunnaki?

325
00:14:20.311 --> 00:14:22.746
<v ->Yeah, they talk about the fact that their planet</v>

326
00:14:22.746 --> 00:14:24.849
was undergoing severe climate change.

327
00:14:24.849 --> 00:14:26.850
Climate change, pretty much the same way

328
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.252
that we're experiencing today, I guess.

329
00:14:29.252 --> 00:14:30.421
There was an interesting article

330
00:14:30.421 --> 00:14:32.023
in the Syndey Morning Herald.

331
00:14:32.023 --> 00:14:35.359
I think it was in 2005, where George Bush,

332
00:14:35.359 --> 00:14:38.262
believe it or not, the brilliant George Bush

333
00:14:38.262 --> 00:14:41.065
asked the scientists of the world to come up

334
00:14:41.065 --> 00:14:44.235
with a solution to find a substance that could be suspended

335
00:14:44.235 --> 00:14:46.972
in the upper atmosphere to protect the Earth

336
00:14:46.972 --> 00:14:50.674
against harmful cosmic rays and rays from the cosmos.

337
00:14:50.674 --> 00:14:53.120
<v Regina>Chemtrails?</v>

338
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.745
<v ->I mean, it's amazing when you read that article</v>

339
00:14:55.745 --> 00:14:57.981
it is like exactly that little extract

340
00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:00.452
from the Sumerian Tablets when they talk about

341
00:15:00.452 --> 00:15:02.720
that they found a substance that could be ground

342
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.022
to the finest powder,

343
00:15:04.022 --> 00:15:05.792
suspended high in the atmosphere,

344
00:15:05.792 --> 00:15:06.791
high in the heavens,

345
00:15:06.791 --> 00:15:10.427
to protect their planet against harmful cosmic rays.

346
00:15:10.427 --> 00:15:15.427
And you go wow, the statement by an American politician

347
00:15:15.733 --> 00:15:20.671
and ancient Sumerian Tablets are virtually identical.

348
00:15:20.671 --> 00:15:23.276
<v Regina>Were you giving Bush extra credit for that?</v>

349
00:15:23.276 --> 00:15:24.908
<v ->I'm giving Bush extra credit for that.</v>

350
00:15:24.908 --> 00:15:29.908
That may be the only credit I'll ever be able to give him.

351
00:15:30.967 --> 00:15:34.485
<v Regina>So the point is it was written about.</v>

352
00:15:34.485 --> 00:15:36.988
So there was an understanding that was documented

353
00:15:36.988 --> 00:15:40.959
among the Sumerians about why the species was coming here

354
00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:42.460
looking for this substance.

355
00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.695
Now, let's talk about what happened with the cloning.

356
00:15:44.695 --> 00:15:47.902
<v ->Yeah, so they found it and they mined it.</v>

357
00:15:47.902 --> 00:15:51.202
And if we found something on Mars

358
00:15:51.202 --> 00:15:53.170
or on some of the planets near us

359
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.805
that we desperately needed for the survival

360
00:15:54.805 --> 00:15:57.111
of our species, we would do exactly the same.

361
00:15:57.111 --> 00:15:57.944
<v Regina>Oh, you bet.</v>

362
00:15:57.944 --> 00:15:59.410
<v ->Absolutely, and we would go there,</v>

363
00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:03.047
absolutely blindly after getting that substance,

364
00:16:03.047 --> 00:16:06.217
bring it back to Earth for us to survive.

365
00:16:06.217 --> 00:16:07.651
So that's what was happening.

366
00:16:07.651 --> 00:16:09.252
They were taking the gold, mining it,

367
00:16:09.252 --> 00:16:11.588
and taking it back to their planet.

368
00:16:11.588 --> 00:16:15.126
And doing with it whatever they were doing with it.

369
00:16:15.126 --> 00:16:19.229
Then they reached a stage after a few thousand years

370
00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:23.266
where they realized they weren't getting enough gold.

371
00:16:23.266 --> 00:16:24.768
Because there wasn't a large number.

372
00:16:24.768 --> 00:16:27.905
Based on the translations, I think the largest total number

373
00:16:27.905 --> 00:16:31.092
of the Anunnaki ever on Earth was about 600.

374
00:16:34.511 --> 00:16:35.412
They needed help.

375
00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:37.948
They needed to mine this in large numbers.

376
00:16:37.948 --> 00:16:42.948
And they made a decision to clone a being

377
00:16:43.087 --> 00:16:45.690
or clone a primitive worker, they referred to it

378
00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:48.826
as the lulu Amelu, the primitive worker,

379
00:16:48.826 --> 00:16:52.529
to help them get the ore out of the ground

380
00:16:52.529 --> 00:16:54.599
and help them get the gold.

381
00:16:54.599 --> 00:16:57.267
And that's where their problems started really,

382
00:16:57.267 --> 00:17:00.171
because they started experimenting with cloning.

383
00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:02.606
And once again the Sumerian translations

384
00:17:02.606 --> 00:17:07.511
are quite explicit in the continuous attempts

385
00:17:07.511 --> 00:17:10.514
at cloning a new being and a new creature.

386
00:17:10.514 --> 00:17:12.717
And they tried to cross-pollinate all kinds of animals

387
00:17:12.717 --> 00:17:14.452
and all kinds of creatures.

388
00:17:14.452 --> 00:17:17.356
And once again we get these mythological stories

389
00:17:17.356 --> 00:17:18.222
about...

390
00:17:18.222 --> 00:17:19.490
<v Regina>Half beast, half man.</v>

391
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:22.794
<v ->Yeah, half horse, half man; half lion and half man.</v>

392
00:17:22.794 --> 00:17:24.728
And you know what?

393
00:17:24.728 --> 00:17:25.863
It's probably true.

394
00:17:25.863 --> 00:17:27.333
They probably did this.

395
00:17:27.333 --> 00:17:28.399
<v Regina>Absolutely, yeah.</v>

396
00:17:28.399 --> 00:17:31.268
<v ->And it's not just mythologically or imaginary,</v>

397
00:17:31.268 --> 00:17:32.904
it's part of history.

398
00:17:32.904 --> 00:17:35.539
And then eventually they stumbled upon

399
00:17:35.539 --> 00:17:40.078
this perfect genetic model called the lulu Amelu,

400
00:17:40.078 --> 00:17:44.315
the primitive worker, and the human race was created.

401
00:17:44.315 --> 00:17:45.283
<v Regina>And this makes perfect sense</v>

402
00:17:45.283 --> 00:17:47.050
when you think about it because A,

403
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:48.519
we're not alone in the universe.

404
00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:50.787
Other cultures are sophisticated enough

405
00:17:50.787 --> 00:17:54.091
to be able to traverse across time and space

406
00:17:54.091 --> 00:17:57.862
in ways that we don't even comprehend it yet

407
00:17:57.862 --> 00:17:59.430
in our body of science.

408
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.801
Cloning, we even know how to clone.

409
00:18:01.801 --> 00:18:03.621
Our species knows how to clone.

410
00:18:03.621 --> 00:18:04.969
This is not a big leap.

411
00:18:04.969 --> 00:18:07.871
Cloning was a way of ceding other planets

412
00:18:07.871 --> 00:18:10.475
throughout the universe or universes.

413
00:18:10.475 --> 00:18:12.977
<v ->You know what happens as well is some people</v>

414
00:18:12.977 --> 00:18:16.579
impose some sort of an evil thing onto this.

415
00:18:16.579 --> 00:18:18.916
And you've got to step away from it and say

416
00:18:18.916 --> 00:18:21.986
when your cat dies and you want to replace your

417
00:18:21.986 --> 00:18:26.423
little kitten, you take your kitten to the cloning clinic

418
00:18:26.423 --> 00:18:29.326
and they take a little sample and they clone you

419
00:18:29.326 --> 00:18:33.463
a kitten that's identical to your kitten, it is your kitten.

420
00:18:33.463 --> 00:18:34.831
It's the clone of your kitten.

421
00:18:34.831 --> 00:18:35.700
<v Regina>How many people</v>

422
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:36.634
wouldn't raise their hand for that?

423
00:18:36.634 --> 00:18:38.502
<v ->Exactly, and do you think you're doing something evil?</v>

424
00:18:38.502 --> 00:18:39.904
No.

425
00:18:39.904 --> 00:18:41.772
Well, that's what most people think.

426
00:18:41.772 --> 00:18:45.576
Well from the eye of the kitten, what if the kitten thinks

427
00:18:45.576 --> 00:18:47.477
why did you bring me into this world?

428
00:18:47.477 --> 00:18:48.947
To be a slave to you?

429
00:18:48.947 --> 00:18:50.482
To live in your house?

430
00:18:50.482 --> 00:18:53.317
For me to depend on you to feed me and all that?

431
00:18:53.317 --> 00:18:55.419
You've made that kitten your slave

432
00:18:55.419 --> 00:18:56.687
for the rest of its life.

433
00:18:56.687 --> 00:18:59.023
But you don't think you've done something evil.

434
00:18:59.023 --> 00:19:03.193
So when the Anunnaki created this primitive worker,

435
00:19:03.193 --> 00:19:06.898
it was a being that had no knowledge, no consciousness.

436
00:19:06.898 --> 00:19:10.201
This could be a very sensitive thing,

437
00:19:10.201 --> 00:19:11.635
this consciousness thing.

438
00:19:11.635 --> 00:19:13.737
It was a very early human.

439
00:19:13.737 --> 00:19:15.772
It had no consciousness because it wasn't able

440
00:19:15.772 --> 00:19:18.008
to think about its own consciousness

441
00:19:18.008 --> 00:19:20.978
because of its naivety and its absolute

442
00:19:20.978 --> 00:19:25.349
baby-like condition as a being.

443
00:19:25.349 --> 00:19:28.119
But what they did do is they had to give it

444
00:19:28.119 --> 00:19:31.655
a large brain, a large frontal lobe because it had

445
00:19:31.655 --> 00:19:33.129
to follow instructions.

446
00:19:33.129 --> 00:19:37.561
It had to perform the instructions accurately,

447
00:19:37.561 --> 00:19:39.833
repetitively without getting bored,

448
00:19:39.833 --> 00:19:41.732
not make mistakes.

449
00:19:41.732 --> 00:19:44.668
So they had to take a creature like a homo erectus

450
00:19:44.668 --> 00:19:48.201
or one of those creatures that was already on Earth

451
00:19:48.201 --> 00:19:51.842
and improve on that and make it a larger brain.

452
00:19:51.842 --> 00:19:53.510
And that's where we see the huge leap

453
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.345
from homo erectus to homo sapien

454
00:19:55.345 --> 00:19:56.847
with a large frontal lobe.

455
00:19:56.847 --> 00:19:59.316
The brain literally doubles in size

456
00:19:59.316 --> 00:20:00.918
from the one to the other.

457
00:20:00.918 --> 00:20:03.187
And that's why we have this missing link problem

458
00:20:03.187 --> 00:20:05.489
from the one species to the other.

459
00:20:05.489 --> 00:20:07.057
The missing link will never be found

460
00:20:07.057 --> 00:20:08.259
because it didn't happen.

461
00:20:08.259 --> 00:20:11.294
The cloning process brought humans forth.

462
00:20:11.294 --> 00:20:13.530
<v Regina>It brought many varieties of humans forth.</v>

463
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:17.003
<v ->Many varieties, and homo neanderthalis</v>

464
00:20:17.003 --> 00:20:20.420
was one of those cloning experiments, too.

465
00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.306
Except that seems that that was cloned

466
00:20:22.306 --> 00:20:24.075
in the European regions because we have no

467
00:20:24.075 --> 00:20:26.244
homo neanderthalis in Africa.

468
00:20:26.244 --> 00:20:29.480
In fact, just recently there have been very interesting

469
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.281
genetic studies to show that there's about

470
00:20:31.281 --> 00:20:34.518
a four percent difference in the DNA

471
00:20:34.518 --> 00:20:39.518
of the homo neanderthalis and African people

472
00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:43.243
that suggest the two actually never interbred.

473
00:20:48.499 --> 00:20:52.203
So this being was cloned and they didn't think

474
00:20:52.203 --> 00:20:54.972
they were doing anything bad because they gave it

475
00:20:54.972 --> 00:20:56.674
a big brain.

476
00:20:56.674 --> 00:21:01.178
And by giving it a big brain they allowed the creature

477
00:21:01.178 --> 00:21:04.415
to at some stage contemplate its own being

478
00:21:04.415 --> 00:21:06.016
and its own consciousness.

479
00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:10.620
It grew from a very infantile little being

480
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.290
into a being of consciousness.

481
00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:16.160
So when I say it was born and created without consciousness,

482
00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:20.131
it's a sensitive issue because it grew into consciousness

483
00:21:20.131 --> 00:21:22.166
because it was allowed to grow into consciousness.

484
00:21:22.166 --> 00:21:23.675
That's how I see it.

485
00:21:23.675 --> 00:21:25.639
Because they had to give it a big frontal lobe.

486
00:21:25.639 --> 00:21:27.805
<v Regina>Okay, so let's move on from there.</v>

487
00:21:27.805 --> 00:21:29.039
They have a large frontal lobe,

488
00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:32.410
and you have said that these beings that were used

489
00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:37.013
for the gold mining operations as the slave species,

490
00:21:37.013 --> 00:21:39.115
the worker bee species of the Anunnaki

491
00:21:39.115 --> 00:21:41.623
were very different in appearance.

492
00:21:41.623 --> 00:21:43.086
What were some of the characteristics

493
00:21:43.086 --> 00:21:44.618
as far as what you understand

494
00:21:44.618 --> 00:21:46.190
of what those beings were like?

495
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.192
<v ->Of the Anunnaki?</v>

496
00:21:47.192 --> 00:21:48.492
<v Regina>No, the beings that were cloned</v>

497
00:21:48.492 --> 00:21:50.093
and created for their use?

498
00:21:52.297 --> 00:21:55.933
<v ->Once again, at this stage we're not really sure</v>

499
00:21:55.933 --> 00:21:59.503
what the first humans looked like.

500
00:21:59.503 --> 00:22:04.308
We suspect that they were slightly taller than we are.

501
00:22:04.308 --> 00:22:09.308
There are two examples for that in southern Africa,

502
00:22:10.181 --> 00:22:12.350
in South Africa specifically.

503
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:17.350
The one is the Boskopoid skull of a human-like being

504
00:22:18.055 --> 00:22:21.892
that was discovered in the early 1900s.

505
00:22:21.892 --> 00:22:24.394
I believe it was 1903 that it was discovered

506
00:22:24.394 --> 00:22:26.130
and it has been one of the best kept secrets

507
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.701
in archaeology and anthropology.

508
00:22:29.701 --> 00:22:33.270
It's been under lock and key for all this time.

509
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:38.270
The skull, the cranium of this species, of this being,

510
00:22:38.942 --> 00:22:41.979
is about 25% larger than the human skull.

511
00:22:41.979 --> 00:22:45.750
So it would have been 25% larger than what we are.

512
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:50.687
And that particular sample is estimated

513
00:22:50.687 --> 00:22:53.090
to be about 35,000 years old.

514
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:56.022
That's based on the strata

515
00:22:56.022 --> 00:22:59.196
within which it was found.

516
00:23:01.031 --> 00:23:02.600
While the estimate is 35,000 years old,

517
00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.936
that's not very accurate science at all.

518
00:23:05.936 --> 00:23:08.271
It could be a lot older.

519
00:23:08.271 --> 00:23:11.107
And then there's another example of a large skeleton

520
00:23:11.107 --> 00:23:12.975
that was found, a full skeleton,

521
00:23:12.975 --> 00:23:15.256
in a mine that was being dug in Namibia,

522
00:23:15.256 --> 00:23:19.016
in a gold mine in Namibia in 1960.

523
00:23:19.016 --> 00:23:22.052
I don't know what happened to the rest of the skeleton,

524
00:23:22.052 --> 00:23:26.190
but the femur of that skeleton has been kept

525
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:28.225
under lock and key at the University

526
00:23:28.225 --> 00:23:31.865
of the Witwatersrand since 1960.

527
00:23:31.865 --> 00:23:33.667
I hope that the information...

528
00:23:33.667 --> 00:23:36.133
<v Regina>What was the proportion of the femur?</v>

529
00:23:36.133 --> 00:23:40.004
<v ->From my understanding it was about nine feet.</v>

530
00:23:40.004 --> 00:23:41.841
<v Regina>It would have indicated a nine-foot tall person.</v>

531
00:23:41.841 --> 00:23:42.973
<v ->A nine-foot tall person.</v>

532
00:23:42.973 --> 00:23:47.444
<v Regina>Now, in addition to that you have a photograph</v>

533
00:23:47.444 --> 00:23:51.047
of a footprint, an ancient footprint

534
00:23:51.047 --> 00:23:53.651
that's really quite startling to anybody who sees it,

535
00:23:53.651 --> 00:23:56.887
which is presumed to be the master species

536
00:23:56.887 --> 00:24:00.190
of the day, the Anunnaki, right?

537
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:03.493
<v ->It's a good question, I'm not sure.</v>

538
00:24:03.493 --> 00:24:04.561
<v Regina>It's a massive footprint,</v>

539
00:24:04.561 --> 00:24:07.230
almost as big as the person that's standing next to it.

540
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:12.169
<v ->Yeah, the footprint is probably about four feet.</v>

541
00:24:12.169 --> 00:24:14.721
It's about four, maybe four and-a-half feet big.

542
00:24:17.443 --> 00:24:18.976
<v Regina>It looks human, it looks like a human.</v>

543
00:24:18.976 --> 00:24:20.677
<v ->It's very human-like.</v>

544
00:24:20.677 --> 00:24:25.015
It looks like just a big human foot which the only problem

545
00:24:25.015 --> 00:24:27.217
with that footprint is that it's got to be between

546
00:24:27.217 --> 00:24:29.786
200 million and 3 billion years old.

547
00:24:29.786 --> 00:24:32.555
The Anunnaki, based on the Sumerian Tablets

548
00:24:32.555 --> 00:24:36.493
only arrived here about 450,000 years ago.

549
00:24:36.493 --> 00:24:38.829
So they may have been here before.

550
00:24:38.829 --> 00:24:39.729
<v Regina>There are more questions.</v>

551
00:24:39.729 --> 00:24:43.135
<v ->Exactly, what that does tell us, that footprint,</v>

552
00:24:43.135 --> 00:24:46.336
is that this Earth has had human-like activity

553
00:24:46.336 --> 00:24:49.239
for a long time and that the arrival of the Anunnaki

554
00:24:49.239 --> 00:24:52.809
was not by any means the first presence

555
00:24:52.809 --> 00:24:55.278
of human-like beings on this planet.

556
00:24:55.278 --> 00:24:57.481
That's why I've put into my presentation,

557
00:24:57.481 --> 00:25:01.952
because in this presentation of the vanished civilizations

558
00:25:01.952 --> 00:25:05.021
of southern Africa just deals with the sudden appearance

559
00:25:05.021 --> 00:25:07.758
of homo sapiens and our species

560
00:25:07.758 --> 00:25:10.627
and the derivative of our species.

561
00:25:10.627 --> 00:25:13.030
the progenitor and the derivative of our species.

562
00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:16.233
I'm not by any means saying that's where it all began.

563
00:25:16.233 --> 00:25:20.036
This Earth has much larger and longer history

564
00:25:20.036 --> 00:25:22.974
that is far more mysterious than most people imagine.

565
00:25:22.974 --> 00:25:25.211
And that's why I show that footprint to say look,

566
00:25:25.211 --> 00:25:29.012
200 million or 3 billion years ago, anywhere in between,

567
00:25:29.012 --> 00:25:32.949
somebody walked over there and left a huge footprint behind.

568
00:25:32.949 --> 00:25:35.051
And that person would have been about seven meters

569
00:25:35.051 --> 00:25:36.686
or nine meters tall.

570
00:25:36.686 --> 00:25:39.491
<v Regina>Yeah, really startling.</v>

571
00:25:39.491 --> 00:25:44.491
As we talk about the actual artifacts themselves,

572
00:25:44.728 --> 00:25:46.530
what's so fascinating about this work

573
00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:49.298
is that everything you've just discussed,

574
00:25:49.298 --> 00:25:50.934
that there was this species that was here

575
00:25:50.934 --> 00:25:55.072
and cloned another species for their use,

576
00:25:55.072 --> 00:25:58.542
the link between that and a geographical location

577
00:25:58.542 --> 00:26:01.378
had not really been established until this work

578
00:26:01.378 --> 00:26:02.479
that you are doing.

579
00:26:02.479 --> 00:26:06.366
And that's what makes it so really,

580
00:26:06.366 --> 00:26:08.585
I mean critical that people find out about this work

581
00:26:08.585 --> 00:26:10.021
at this time.

582
00:26:10.021 --> 00:26:12.656
<v ->Yeah, and that's really what struck me is that</v>

583
00:26:12.656 --> 00:26:16.460
after Slave Species of God, I thought

584
00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.028
okay, I've done my job.

585
00:26:18.028 --> 00:26:20.230
I'll carry on doing whatever I was doing.

586
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.802
I'll do some talks on the origins of humankind

587
00:26:22.802 --> 00:26:25.669
and the slave species, and that wasn't the case.

588
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:29.139
Very quickly, I think within six months of doing talks

589
00:26:29.139 --> 00:26:32.309
on slave species, one of the guys that came

590
00:26:32.309 --> 00:26:35.812
to my presentation was a guy called Johan Heine.

591
00:26:35.812 --> 00:26:39.916
And after my presentation, realizing I was a South African,

592
00:26:39.916 --> 00:26:42.118
he said wow, I thought you were an American.

593
00:26:42.118 --> 00:26:45.189
Since you're a local guy, let me show you this stuff.

594
00:26:45.189 --> 00:26:47.691
Maybe we can work on this, or tell me what you think.

595
00:26:47.691 --> 00:26:48.725
I want to show you, he told me,

596
00:26:48.725 --> 00:26:50.093
I want to show you this stuff.

597
00:26:50.093 --> 00:26:51.594
He whipped out his laptop and he started showing me

598
00:26:51.594 --> 00:26:54.531
all the aerial photographs that he'd been taking

599
00:26:54.531 --> 00:26:57.104
for the last 20 years of these stone ruins

600
00:26:57.104 --> 00:26:59.037
all around southern Africa.

601
00:26:59.037 --> 00:27:02.205
All over, they actually cross through Zimbabwe

602
00:27:02.205 --> 00:27:03.908
and across into Zambia as well,

603
00:27:03.908 --> 00:27:05.474
and continues further north.

604
00:27:05.474 --> 00:27:07.378
But the largest concentration that we found

605
00:27:07.378 --> 00:27:08.812
is in southern Africa.

606
00:27:08.812 --> 00:27:11.581
And I was absolutely astounded.

607
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:13.116
I could not believe my eyes.

608
00:27:13.116 --> 00:27:15.519
I couldn't believe that nobody knew about this.

609
00:27:15.519 --> 00:27:17.354
It was just so obvious.

610
00:27:17.354 --> 00:27:21.592
And something inside me told me that this is directly linked

611
00:27:21.592 --> 00:27:26.592
to the slave species theory or evidence.

612
00:27:27.463 --> 00:27:28.933
<v Regina>Not the least of which it has the greatest</v>

613
00:27:28.933 --> 00:27:31.368
saturation of gold mines in the world.

614
00:27:31.368 --> 00:27:32.936
<v ->Well at that stage we didn't even realize</v>

615
00:27:32.936 --> 00:27:34.070
it was linked to gold.

616
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:37.774
We were just amazed that there were these stone structures.

617
00:27:37.774 --> 00:27:40.844
I went and saw Johan a few months later

618
00:27:40.844 --> 00:27:43.914
and we flew in a helicopter and we saw it from the air.

619
00:27:43.914 --> 00:27:45.749
And it's only when you fly in the helicopter

620
00:27:45.749 --> 00:27:47.318
and you look at it from the air

621
00:27:47.318 --> 00:27:49.453
that you know what's going on.

622
00:27:49.453 --> 00:27:51.955
It hits you and you go oh, my God,

623
00:27:51.955 --> 00:27:53.490
this is something much bigger

624
00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:56.459
than anyone could have ever imagined.

625
00:27:56.459 --> 00:27:59.429
So I immediately started working on a book.

626
00:27:59.429 --> 00:28:01.367
And at that stage Johan had also discovered

627
00:28:01.367 --> 00:28:03.436
what we now called Adam's calendar.

628
00:28:03.436 --> 00:28:06.905
He's really the key guy in bringing this information

629
00:28:06.905 --> 00:28:08.605
and not giving up.

630
00:28:08.605 --> 00:28:11.275
For many years he tried to get this information across

631
00:28:11.275 --> 00:28:14.177
to the authorities and archaeologists in the universities.

632
00:28:14.177 --> 00:28:16.345
And they just kept telling him go away,

633
00:28:16.345 --> 00:28:17.881
you're irritating us, you're an idiot,

634
00:28:17.881 --> 00:28:20.718
you don't know what you're talking about.

635
00:28:20.718 --> 00:28:22.085
And luckily he didn't give up.

636
00:28:22.085 --> 00:28:26.590
He carried on and realized that many of the stone structures

637
00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:29.326
were aligned with the sunrises and solstices

638
00:28:29.326 --> 00:28:31.461
and equinoxes.

639
00:28:31.461 --> 00:28:33.930
And then Adam's calendar most of all became

640
00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:36.767
the most crucial discovery that he made.

641
00:28:36.767 --> 00:28:39.569
He realized that it's not just a random selection of stones,

642
00:28:39.569 --> 00:28:42.205
part of the bedrock standing up.

643
00:28:42.205 --> 00:28:45.175
It's clearly, for those that will go

644
00:28:45.175 --> 00:28:47.076
and look at the information,

645
00:28:47.076 --> 00:28:49.613
it's obvious that it's an ancient calendar site.

646
00:28:49.613 --> 00:28:52.549
And he saw it instantly.

647
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:55.352
He went and started measuring it and that's when

648
00:28:55.352 --> 00:28:56.553
I got involved with him.

649
00:28:56.553 --> 00:28:59.823
After five years of his work, I entered the picture.

650
00:28:59.823 --> 00:29:03.162
Then we started analyzing it a little bit more

651
00:29:03.162 --> 00:29:06.196
and had it measured and realized that the north,

652
00:29:06.196 --> 00:29:08.398
south, east, west alignments are out

653
00:29:08.398 --> 00:29:11.968
by three and a quarter degrees anti-clockwise.

654
00:29:11.968 --> 00:29:14.204
And that was just a big shock to the system.

655
00:29:14.204 --> 00:29:15.805
I mean, how could north, south, east, west

656
00:29:15.805 --> 00:29:19.510
not be true to north, south, east, west today?

657
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:22.245
So that immediately made me go, hold on.

658
00:29:22.245 --> 00:29:26.349
And the first thought I had was crustal shift.

659
00:29:26.349 --> 00:29:27.717
Crustal displacement,

660
00:29:27.717 --> 00:29:32.088
shifting of the true north-south line, north-south pole

661
00:29:32.088 --> 00:29:35.058
that Charles Hapgood was a proponent for

662
00:29:35.058 --> 00:29:39.796
who died, I think in 1974 or maybe later.

663
00:29:39.796 --> 00:29:43.967
This was amazing because Einstein was a big supporter

664
00:29:43.967 --> 00:29:46.169
of Charles Hapgood's theory of the whole crustal

665
00:29:46.169 --> 00:29:49.172
displacement, of the movement of the poles.

666
00:29:49.172 --> 00:29:51.112
And I'm not talking about the magnetic poles here.

667
00:29:51.112 --> 00:29:54.778
I'm talking true north-south that actually shifts

668
00:29:54.778 --> 00:29:59.221
with the movement of the mass of land

669
00:29:59.221 --> 00:30:01.217
on the planet.

670
00:30:01.217 --> 00:30:05.621
And that causes the shift of equatorial areas as well.

671
00:30:05.621 --> 00:30:08.225
And Hapgood suggested that in the last hundred years

672
00:30:08.225 --> 00:30:12.462
we may have had as many as three shifts in the pole

673
00:30:12.462 --> 00:30:13.796
in the last hundred years.

674
00:30:13.796 --> 00:30:15.799
And he indicates where it would have happened

675
00:30:15.799 --> 00:30:17.370
to the equatorial regions.

676
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.069
If you look at his work, it actually indicates

677
00:30:20.069 --> 00:30:21.772
the movements.

678
00:30:21.772 --> 00:30:23.676
There was a time when the Sahara would have been

679
00:30:23.676 --> 00:30:25.311
an equatorial region.

680
00:30:25.311 --> 00:30:27.009
And now suddenly it makes a lot more sense

681
00:30:27.009 --> 00:30:29.513
when they tell us that while the Egyptians

682
00:30:29.513 --> 00:30:31.715
and ancient civilizations were there,

683
00:30:31.715 --> 00:30:34.184
there were lots of trees and things there.

684
00:30:34.184 --> 00:30:35.485
And now it's a desert.

685
00:30:35.485 --> 00:30:36.853
And that's where they got all the trees from

686
00:30:36.853 --> 00:30:38.755
that they needed for everything they were doing.

687
00:30:38.755 --> 00:30:40.593
Today we can't imagine that.

688
00:30:40.593 --> 00:30:42.625
Hapgood's theory shows that.

689
00:30:42.625 --> 00:30:45.528
I believe that our discovery with Adam's calendar

690
00:30:45.528 --> 00:30:50.166
and the fact that it's out of alignment with north-south

691
00:30:50.166 --> 00:30:54.271
is proof of this crustal shift, this crustal displacement,

692
00:30:54.271 --> 00:30:56.773
and the movement of north-south,

693
00:30:56.773 --> 00:30:59.044
the shift of the pole.

694
00:30:59.044 --> 00:31:01.013
That is a spectacular discovery.

695
00:31:01.013 --> 00:31:04.017
And we haven't even come close to realizing

696
00:31:04.017 --> 00:31:06.549
its full implications.

697
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:08.718
<v Regina>At the same time, you were able</v>

698
00:31:08.718 --> 00:31:10.920
to decipher some of what was going on

699
00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.528
with the materials that were involved

700
00:31:12.528 --> 00:31:13.724
in some of these structures,

701
00:31:13.724 --> 00:31:15.192
which is really fascinating.

702
00:31:15.192 --> 00:31:18.098
In fact, if someone wants to go right now,

703
00:31:18.098 --> 00:31:20.997
or after they're done watching this interview,

704
00:31:20.997 --> 00:31:25.997
to YouTube and find your video on the ringing rocks

705
00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.606
what would that be under?

706
00:31:29.606 --> 00:31:31.708
<v ->It's Stones that Ring Like Bells.</v>

707
00:31:31.708 --> 00:31:33.486
<v Regina>Stones that Ring Like Bells, okay on YouTube.</v>

708
00:31:33.486 --> 00:31:37.214
Now let's get into the composition of the stones,

709
00:31:37.214 --> 00:31:40.016
of these incredible structures that we're seeing,

710
00:31:40.016 --> 00:31:44.220
and these interesting geometrical shapes,

711
00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.756
mostly circular in nature.

712
00:31:46.756 --> 00:31:49.525
Get into the composition of it, the structure,

713
00:31:49.525 --> 00:31:53.863
and what you believe the structures were used for.

714
00:31:53.863 --> 00:31:57.567
<v ->When I first started looking at the stone ruins</v>

715
00:31:57.567 --> 00:32:01.104
I moved out from Johannesburg into a little town

716
00:32:01.104 --> 00:32:03.372
called Waterval Boven, because it's right there

717
00:32:03.372 --> 00:32:06.843
in the heart of the most dense area of these stone ruins.

718
00:32:06.843 --> 00:32:09.879
And I started walking the mountains, actually.

719
00:32:09.879 --> 00:32:12.114
Get out in the morning and you walk the mountains

720
00:32:12.114 --> 00:32:14.218
and you go and see the ruins.

721
00:32:14.218 --> 00:32:17.554
And I must have seen a thousand of them.

722
00:32:17.554 --> 00:32:22.426
At which point I got surprised because I realize

723
00:32:22.426 --> 00:32:24.393
that there are a lot more of these ruins

724
00:32:24.393 --> 00:32:26.171
than anyone had imagined.

725
00:32:26.171 --> 00:32:30.633
At that stage I estimated about 100,000 of these

726
00:32:30.633 --> 00:32:33.203
which was an unthinkable number.

727
00:32:33.203 --> 00:32:35.839
<v Regina>You're talking about hundreds of kilometers,</v>

728
00:32:35.839 --> 00:32:37.640
or thousands of kilometers?

729
00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.977
<v ->Just the number of stone, circular stone structures.</v>

730
00:32:40.977 --> 00:32:42.478
<v Regina>Over an expanse.</v>

731
00:32:42.478 --> 00:32:47.478
<v ->The area that I live in is probably 150 by 100 miles,</v>

732
00:32:47.951 --> 00:32:49.688
or something like that.

733
00:32:49.688 --> 00:32:51.021
<v Regina>This is just your neighborhood.</v>

734
00:32:51.021 --> 00:32:54.157
<v ->150 by 100 kilometers, not miles.</v>

735
00:32:54.157 --> 00:32:59.157
And in that area I looked wide, and all over the place.

736
00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:04.601
I walked around these ruins and try to find

737
00:33:04.601 --> 00:33:06.969
as many of them as possible.

738
00:33:06.969 --> 00:33:09.672
And just really observe them, look at them,

739
00:33:09.672 --> 00:33:11.140
look at how they're structured.

740
00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.979
Look at the difference in structures.

741
00:33:12.979 --> 00:33:15.644
Seeing the manipulation of these ruins

742
00:33:15.644 --> 00:33:17.080
by later civilizations.

743
00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:20.650
You can clearly see when the later movement of people

744
00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:22.953
come through there and they manipulate them

745
00:33:22.953 --> 00:33:25.555
and they change them and make little entrances in them,

746
00:33:25.555 --> 00:33:26.314
and things like that.

747
00:33:26.314 --> 00:33:28.624
So you can start recognizing that there's been

748
00:33:28.624 --> 00:33:32.329
movements of civilization after civilization

749
00:33:32.329 --> 00:33:34.197
utilizing these structures.

750
00:33:34.197 --> 00:33:35.968
What's interesting about this as well

751
00:33:35.968 --> 00:33:39.902
is that most of the visible ones are on tops of mountains.

752
00:33:39.902 --> 00:33:41.538
And that's what Johan Heine

753
00:33:41.538 --> 00:33:43.940
started photographing initially.

754
00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.608
And they all seemed to be scattered along

755
00:33:45.608 --> 00:33:49.079
the tops of mountains, which was a bit of an enigma.

756
00:33:49.079 --> 00:33:51.714
Why are they all on tops of mountains?

757
00:33:51.714 --> 00:33:55.218
Which later became very obvious.

758
00:33:55.218 --> 00:33:59.155
But it took a while for us to, for me to realize

759
00:33:59.155 --> 00:34:02.625
that it wasn't a random kind of stone that was used.

760
00:34:02.625 --> 00:34:04.861
It was all the same kind of stone.

761
00:34:04.861 --> 00:34:06.866
And you can clearly see when the later civilizations

762
00:34:06.866 --> 00:34:08.298
arrive and they had no idea

763
00:34:08.298 --> 00:34:10.634
what the original structures were for.

764
00:34:10.634 --> 00:34:12.401
But you can see the different layers

765
00:34:12.401 --> 00:34:14.805
of a different kind of stone being put

766
00:34:14.805 --> 00:34:17.740
on top of the original stone walls.

767
00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:20.076
<v Regina>Which were not stones native to that area,</v>

768
00:34:20.076 --> 00:34:21.478
at all.

769
00:34:21.478 --> 00:34:22.912
<v ->They're not native to that area.</v>

770
00:34:22.912 --> 00:34:25.015
Well, sometimes they're native, but they're not

771
00:34:25.015 --> 00:34:27.483
necessarily from that specific area.

772
00:34:27.483 --> 00:34:29.852
You still have to go down to the river to fetch them.

773
00:34:29.852 --> 00:34:31.520
So you still have to bring them a long way

774
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.258
to construct your structure.

775
00:34:35.258 --> 00:34:38.728
And I realize that the stone that we're dealing with

776
00:34:38.728 --> 00:34:42.665
it was during one of the times that we were clearing

777
00:34:42.665 --> 00:34:44.967
one of the ruins so we could take tourists there

778
00:34:44.967 --> 00:34:47.073
and show them these walls,

779
00:34:47.073 --> 00:34:49.775
that we were picking up the stones that were lying

780
00:34:49.775 --> 00:34:52.308
all over the place from the collapsed walls

781
00:34:52.308 --> 00:34:54.811
so that you could walk there and not walk on the stones

782
00:34:54.811 --> 00:34:56.612
so we were creating a path.

783
00:34:56.612 --> 00:34:58.381
And as we were moving the stones,

784
00:34:58.381 --> 00:35:01.719
I started hearing them clanging against each other

785
00:35:01.719 --> 00:35:06.719
and I went hold on, these things ring like bells.

786
00:35:06.956 --> 00:35:11.261
As the guys were picking them up and them on a pile,

787
00:35:11.261 --> 00:35:13.429
it was like ding ding, ding ding ding.

788
00:35:13.429 --> 00:35:15.832
It was like what is going on here?

789
00:35:15.832 --> 00:35:18.767
This is like a musical cacophony that's going on

790
00:35:18.767 --> 00:35:20.203
down there while they're packing the stones

791
00:35:20.203 --> 00:35:21.938
on these little piles.

792
00:35:21.938 --> 00:35:24.043
And it suddenly hit me.

793
00:35:24.043 --> 00:35:25.242
These stones ring like bells.

794
00:35:25.242 --> 00:35:27.744
They've got very specific acoustic properties.

795
00:35:27.744 --> 00:35:30.013
And that's when it just opened up and I realized

796
00:35:30.013 --> 00:35:33.783
that this is not just accidental stone building,

797
00:35:33.783 --> 00:35:37.687
that there was a much higher, a much more obvious purpose

798
00:35:37.687 --> 00:35:39.656
behind it we hadn't thought about.

799
00:35:39.656 --> 00:35:41.625
<v Regina>And you had the stones analyzed.</v>

800
00:35:41.625 --> 00:35:45.010
Over 50% quartz essentially.

801
00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:50.010
<v ->I had them analyzed and they're 54% silica dioxide.</v>

802
00:35:50.667 --> 00:35:55.667
And then the rest of it is iron and aluminum.

803
00:35:55.839 --> 00:35:58.608
And those are very important as well.

804
00:35:58.608 --> 00:36:00.843
But it's a very, very hard rock.

805
00:36:00.843 --> 00:36:02.078
It's known as hornfels.

806
00:36:02.078 --> 00:36:06.015
In South Africa the geological formation is called hornfels.

807
00:36:06.015 --> 00:36:08.151
It's extremely hard.

808
00:36:08.151 --> 00:36:10.487
When I say hard, I mean really hard.

809
00:36:10.487 --> 00:36:12.590
I tried to break a stone this size.

810
00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:15.524
I could not break it with all my force and might

811
00:36:15.524 --> 00:36:17.093
on top of the mountain.

812
00:36:17.093 --> 00:36:18.798
I tried to break it so I could send one half

813
00:36:18.798 --> 00:36:22.132
to the laboratory so we could do patina growth studies.

814
00:36:22.132 --> 00:36:23.399
And eventually I took the whole stone

815
00:36:23.399 --> 00:36:24.568
and I sent the whole stone to the lab

816
00:36:24.568 --> 00:36:26.702
'cause I couldn't break it.

817
00:36:26.702 --> 00:36:28.204
I said, now the guys can deal with it in the lab.

818
00:36:28.204 --> 00:36:29.906
They can saw it in half,

819
00:36:29.906 --> 00:36:32.178
because I can't break the bloody thing.

820
00:36:32.178 --> 00:36:34.678
<v Regina>You can hear these acoustic properties</v>

821
00:36:34.678 --> 00:36:36.413
even with the patina on it.

822
00:36:36.413 --> 00:36:41.413
And even though it's not in its original unfiltered form,

823
00:36:42.118 --> 00:36:43.520
so to speak.

824
00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:47.257
<v ->The natural stone is a very dark charcoal kind of color.</v>

825
00:36:47.257 --> 00:36:48.224
It's beautiful.

826
00:36:48.224 --> 00:36:52.795
It's very homogeneous content.

827
00:36:52.795 --> 00:36:55.568
The minerals are perfectly mixed in it.

828
00:36:55.568 --> 00:36:57.933
And that's why it's called a metamorphosized

829
00:36:57.933 --> 00:37:00.637
quartz size, because at some stage it must have been

830
00:37:00.637 --> 00:37:04.674
exposed to high heat, between 500 and 600 degrees Celsius,

831
00:37:04.674 --> 00:37:07.944
which caused this homogeneous property.

832
00:37:07.944 --> 00:37:10.313
And it's that property that the builders

833
00:37:10.313 --> 00:37:12.649
of these stone ruins were after.

834
00:37:12.649 --> 00:37:15.118
And that's why these used the stone,

835
00:37:15.118 --> 00:37:17.753
because it rings like bells, it's got acoustic properties.

836
00:37:17.753 --> 00:37:20.155
Just like the builders of Stonehenge used the stones

837
00:37:20.155 --> 00:37:22.425
in Stonehenge for their acoustic properties,

838
00:37:22.425 --> 00:37:25.097
the same thing happened here.

839
00:37:25.097 --> 00:37:29.666
I went and I recorded a lot of the stones, the ringing.

840
00:37:29.666 --> 00:37:32.735
I walked around with my friend from Johannesburg

841
00:37:32.735 --> 00:37:36.973
and we recorded the sound of over,

842
00:37:36.973 --> 00:37:38.875
well over 100 stones.

843
00:37:38.875 --> 00:37:40.177
<v Regina>Each stone had its own tone?</v>

844
00:37:40.177 --> 00:37:43.179
<v ->Yeah, and then he went back to his music studio.</v>

845
00:37:43.179 --> 00:37:46.182
He analyzed the frequencies of the stones.

846
00:37:46.182 --> 00:37:48.717
At this stage there's a lot more work

847
00:37:48.717 --> 00:37:51.353
to be done there, obviously, but at this stage they,

848
00:37:51.353 --> 00:37:54.791
between 200 hertz and 16 and a half thousand hertz.

849
00:37:54.791 --> 00:37:56.993
So it's almost within the audible spectrum

850
00:37:56.993 --> 00:38:00.796
of the human audible spectrum.

851
00:38:00.796 --> 00:38:03.099
But there's a lot more.

852
00:38:03.099 --> 00:38:05.401
And the other thing is some of the stones ring

853
00:38:05.401 --> 00:38:07.670
at more than one frequency.

854
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:09.507
They resonate at more than one frequency.

855
00:38:09.507 --> 00:38:12.575
So it becomes really interesting and more complex.

856
00:38:12.575 --> 00:38:16.346
I started thinking that at that stage

857
00:38:16.346 --> 00:38:18.348
that they were using the stone circles

858
00:38:18.348 --> 00:38:20.349
to generate standing waves.

859
00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:23.218
Because when you have these stones in circles

860
00:38:23.218 --> 00:38:25.588
and you create a sound frequency in the middle,

861
00:38:25.588 --> 00:38:28.491
just like a piano when you, how do you tune a piano?

862
00:38:28.491 --> 00:38:30.693
You take a tuning fork, you smack it,

863
00:38:30.693 --> 00:38:32.695
and you put it on top of the piano.

864
00:38:32.695 --> 00:38:34.730
And the ringing tuning fork starts

865
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:38.634
to vibrate the strings in the piano.

866
00:38:38.634 --> 00:38:40.870
And that's exactly what would happen if you took

867
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:42.839
a tuning fork and you put it in the middle

868
00:38:42.839 --> 00:38:47.009
of this circle with thousands and thousands of strings.

869
00:38:47.009 --> 00:38:49.045
Each stone is like a string.

870
00:38:49.045 --> 00:38:51.814
If you resonate a fork or a sound in the middle

871
00:38:51.814 --> 00:38:54.817
it will make the stones in the walls vibrate

872
00:38:54.817 --> 00:38:56.385
at that specific frequency.

873
00:38:56.385 --> 00:38:58.421
And eventually they will all start to vibrate

874
00:38:58.421 --> 00:39:01.257
at that frequency, those that vibrate at that frequency,

875
00:39:01.257 --> 00:39:03.125
many thousands of them.

876
00:39:03.125 --> 00:39:07.630
And create an incredibly loud cacophony of that frequency,

877
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:11.199
which is a very powerful sound, powerful source of energy.

878
00:39:11.199 --> 00:39:14.704
And you create what would be known as a standing wave.

879
00:39:14.704 --> 00:39:17.073
And people at work with sound and electronics

880
00:39:17.073 --> 00:39:19.642
understand how powerful a standing wave can be.

881
00:39:19.642 --> 00:39:21.618
And the only way you can then destroy that

882
00:39:21.618 --> 00:39:26.448
is by introducing an interfering wave,

883
00:39:26.448 --> 00:39:27.953
that's how you destroy it.

884
00:39:27.953 --> 00:39:29.619
So I thought at that stage that that's how they

885
00:39:29.619 --> 00:39:31.520
were generating the energy.

886
00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.694
But then that changed, obviously as well.

887
00:39:34.694 --> 00:39:36.359
I still think that's one of the ways that they

888
00:39:36.359 --> 00:39:39.997
were generating energy in the circular stone structures

889
00:39:39.997 --> 00:39:44.103
that have no internal structures.

890
00:39:44.103 --> 00:39:46.269
But then it got even more interesting when we started

891
00:39:46.269 --> 00:39:49.038
realizing there were other aspects to it.

892
00:39:49.038 --> 00:39:50.308
<v Regina>Let's talk about some of that,</v>

893
00:39:50.308 --> 00:39:51.707
some of the formations.

894
00:39:51.707 --> 00:39:55.745
The one that is in more modern terms known as,

895
00:39:55.745 --> 00:39:57.580
is it a magnatron?

896
00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:58.247
<v ->Yeah.</v>

897
00:39:58.247 --> 00:40:01.617
<v Regina>The magnatron which was used in the 1940s.</v>

898
00:40:01.617 --> 00:40:06.091
Okay, so let's talk about that because that exact image

899
00:40:06.091 --> 00:40:11.091
or geometrical formation is what you found there

900
00:40:11.427 --> 00:40:13.496
with these pathways coming out of it.

901
00:40:13.496 --> 00:40:14.997
It's quite interesting.

902
00:40:14.997 --> 00:40:17.763
So now, let's get to what you think may have been going on.

903
00:40:17.763 --> 00:40:20.769
<v ->The important thing is to note that</v>

904
00:40:20.769 --> 00:40:23.305
all the circular structures are unique.

905
00:40:23.305 --> 00:40:24.809
Each one is totally unique.

906
00:40:24.809 --> 00:40:25.876
And the internal structures

907
00:40:25.876 --> 00:40:28.811
of the circular stone ruins are unique.

908
00:40:28.811 --> 00:40:31.015
Each one is so completely unique and sometimes

909
00:40:31.015 --> 00:40:34.016
so complex in its nature that the mind boggles.

910
00:40:34.016 --> 00:40:38.154
You;d go why would anybody come up with this shape?

911
00:40:38.154 --> 00:40:41.891
If you had to build a stone structure to live in

912
00:40:41.891 --> 00:40:43.935
or to do something in, you'd build a circle,

913
00:40:43.935 --> 00:40:48.935
a circle out of stones and that's it.

914
00:40:49.566 --> 00:40:52.535
You wouldn't build these weird little nooks and crannies,

915
00:40:52.535 --> 00:40:53.836
and a little pile of stones there

916
00:40:53.836 --> 00:40:56.105
and then a pile of stones there,

917
00:40:56.105 --> 00:40:57.848
and then this little thing sticking out there,

918
00:40:57.848 --> 00:40:59.174
and this attachment here.

919
00:40:59.174 --> 00:41:01.844
<v Regina>Almost like channels connecting them.</v>

920
00:41:01.844 --> 00:41:06.844
<v ->And then on top of this have all of these circles</v>

921
00:41:06.849 --> 00:41:08.585
connected by these roads.

922
00:41:08.585 --> 00:41:11.754
Originally we called ancient roads.

923
00:41:11.754 --> 00:41:12.622
It made no sense.

924
00:41:12.622 --> 00:41:15.957
And what I found is that all of the ancient structures

925
00:41:15.957 --> 00:41:18.393
were connected by these roads.

926
00:41:18.393 --> 00:41:21.998
And not only connected by these roads from circle to circle,

927
00:41:21.998 --> 00:41:26.998
they were interspersed by agricultural terraces.

928
00:41:28.004 --> 00:41:32.541
And this spider's web effect that lead into

929
00:41:32.541 --> 00:41:35.311
what are obvious, seem to be obvious

930
00:41:35.311 --> 00:41:39.615
agricultural terraces for growing some sort of crops.

931
00:41:39.615 --> 00:41:43.519
And the whole thing is just like one continuous grid

932
00:41:43.519 --> 00:41:48.223
made up of the same kind of stone that ring like bells.

933
00:41:48.223 --> 00:41:50.493
That are very good channelers of energy

934
00:41:50.493 --> 00:41:53.630
and of frequency and of sound.

935
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:56.231
And that obviously got me going.

936
00:41:56.231 --> 00:41:57.933
And I realized that what we're looking at,

937
00:41:57.933 --> 00:42:02.933
the specific shapes of these stone ruins

938
00:42:03.274 --> 00:42:06.913
are actually representative cymatic shapes

939
00:42:06.913 --> 00:42:09.646
of the energies that come out of the surface

940
00:42:09.646 --> 00:42:11.146
of planet Earth.

941
00:42:11.146 --> 00:42:12.881
And that's what this is all about.

942
00:42:12.881 --> 00:42:15.117
They understood what Nikola Tesla

943
00:42:15.117 --> 00:42:19.087
and John Keely and others discovered in more recent times

944
00:42:19.087 --> 00:42:22.158
in the last 120 odd years when they started

945
00:42:22.158 --> 00:42:24.093
telling us that the Earth rings like a bell

946
00:42:24.093 --> 00:42:27.028
and that therein lies the answer to the free energy

947
00:42:27.028 --> 00:42:28.330
that we're looking for.

948
00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.466
That we can tap into the energy of the planet

949
00:42:30.466 --> 00:42:33.168
and actually use that for all our needs.

950
00:42:33.168 --> 00:42:35.738
And that's what these guys seemed to have been doing.

951
00:42:35.738 --> 00:42:39.241
And that is why all these circular structures

952
00:42:39.241 --> 00:42:42.243
have completely unique patterns to represent

953
00:42:42.243 --> 00:42:46.382
the sound shapes, the shapes of the cymatic sound waves

954
00:42:46.382 --> 00:42:50.119
as they come out of the surface at that specific point.

955
00:42:50.119 --> 00:42:52.121
And that's why they connected.

956
00:42:52.121 --> 00:42:56.491
And that leads us to not only the understanding

957
00:42:56.491 --> 00:42:59.495
of this frequency coming out of planet Earth,

958
00:42:59.495 --> 00:43:02.564
but also amplifying that frequency.

959
00:43:02.564 --> 00:43:05.601
And really turning it into a real dynamo

960
00:43:05.601 --> 00:43:10.139
and a generator of a lot more energy.

961
00:43:10.139 --> 00:43:13.342
Incidentally, that's what I believe eventually

962
00:43:13.342 --> 00:43:17.079
led to the destruction of Atlantis.

963
00:43:17.079 --> 00:43:18.747
That's the information that I've been given,

964
00:43:18.747 --> 00:43:20.716
and I found this quite interesting.

965
00:43:20.716 --> 00:43:22.617
There's a psychic lady in Johannesburg,

966
00:43:22.617 --> 00:43:24.517
in fact, the same lady that gave me the picture

967
00:43:24.517 --> 00:43:27.255
of the energy fields coming out of the pyramids,

968
00:43:27.255 --> 00:43:32.255
the great pyramid told me when she saw what I was working on

969
00:43:32.728 --> 00:43:34.496
she said that is the shape.

970
00:43:34.496 --> 00:43:38.134
That is the energy device that caused the sinking

971
00:43:38.134 --> 00:43:39.635
and destruction of the Atlantis.

972
00:43:39.635 --> 00:43:43.202
It look her like five seconds.

973
00:43:43.202 --> 00:43:45.475
She took a look at it and she went that's it.

974
00:43:45.475 --> 00:43:48.176
It was like whoa, that's amazing.

975
00:43:48.176 --> 00:43:51.381
And it really resonated with me because I know

976
00:43:51.381 --> 00:43:53.115
how powerful that device is.

977
00:43:53.115 --> 00:43:55.917
And some people, it may take a while for them

978
00:43:55.917 --> 00:43:58.020
to realize how powerful these energy devices are,

979
00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:01.724
because it's so alien to us today.

980
00:44:01.724 --> 00:44:06.195
<v Regina>And then you hear a lot of thought</v>

981
00:44:06.195 --> 00:44:10.266
over the last decades as the species begins to wake up.

982
00:44:10.266 --> 00:44:14.603
As people, like yourself and many, begin remembering

983
00:44:14.603 --> 00:44:16.838
I really think this is more of a remembrance

984
00:44:16.838 --> 00:44:21.610
on a long sole lineage here of these technologies

985
00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:24.214
and what they were utilized for at a given point in time.

986
00:44:24.214 --> 00:44:27.216
And then you look at the seemingly mental and emotional

987
00:44:27.216 --> 00:44:30.151
either instability or immaturity of the species

988
00:44:30.151 --> 00:44:32.221
and what we have been manipulated into

989
00:44:32.221 --> 00:44:33.756
and what we have become right now.

990
00:44:33.756 --> 00:44:36.558
And you think perhaps it isn't quite,

991
00:44:36.558 --> 00:44:38.861
the time hasn't been quite right for these energies

992
00:44:38.861 --> 00:44:41.029
to reemerge, because who horrid things

993
00:44:41.029 --> 00:44:44.199
might we choose to do with them against each other?

994
00:44:44.199 --> 00:44:46.835
And on the other hand, the time is becoming

995
00:44:46.835 --> 00:44:50.572
absolutely ripe for this to begin emerging really

996
00:44:50.572 --> 00:44:54.723
for the healthy continuation of the species.

997
00:44:54.723 --> 00:44:58.347
<v ->I think there's no doubt that the control groups</v>

998
00:44:58.347 --> 00:45:01.017
on this planet already know this technology.

999
00:45:01.017 --> 00:45:03.285
And they are using this technology.

1000
00:45:03.285 --> 00:45:08.285
In a sense, we see it in the harp, harp thing

1001
00:45:08.891 --> 00:45:11.360
that they're doing and many other things

1002
00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.863
that we're probably completely unaware of.

1003
00:45:13.863 --> 00:45:18.200
<v Regina>Being used in a militarization of the planet.</v>

1004
00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.736
And against the people, really.

1005
00:45:20.736 --> 00:45:23.805
<v ->To control and subjugate the people</v>

1006
00:45:23.805 --> 00:45:27.054
and keep them in line.

1007
00:45:27.054 --> 00:45:29.812
<v Regina>So are people like you coming to the surface</v>

1008
00:45:29.812 --> 00:45:32.615
now to say no, this should be utilized by all.

1009
00:45:32.615 --> 00:45:36.955
This was utilized in past times for okay,

1010
00:45:36.955 --> 00:45:40.556
maybe usurious, but not for destructive purposes at least.

1011
00:45:40.556 --> 00:45:42.591
They were harnessing this energy for use,

1012
00:45:42.591 --> 00:45:44.693
and the part that you were continuing on

1013
00:45:44.693 --> 00:45:47.829
is they used that for the energy that was needed

1014
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:50.632
for the process of mining gold and separating it out

1015
00:45:50.632 --> 00:45:51.666
and so forth.

1016
00:45:51.666 --> 00:45:53.370
<v ->Well, they used the energy for everything.</v>

1017
00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:56.172
For digging the ore out of the ground,

1018
00:45:56.172 --> 00:45:58.910
for crushing the ore, for separating the minerals,

1019
00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:02.510
for transporting the stuff that they needed to transport

1020
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:04.747
along these channels that linked all these

1021
00:46:04.747 --> 00:46:07.115
stone structures together.

1022
00:46:07.115 --> 00:46:09.218
Because these are all energy devices that they created

1023
00:46:09.218 --> 00:46:13.989
anti-gravity effects like our modern electromagnetic trains

1024
00:46:13.989 --> 00:46:16.224
float on the tracks.

1025
00:46:16.224 --> 00:46:18.727
And nobody goes wow, that's imposssible.

1026
00:46:18.727 --> 00:46:20.261
What's happening?

1027
00:46:20.261 --> 00:46:21.996
Well, they were generating the energy fields

1028
00:46:21.996 --> 00:46:24.233
in the circles and basically these channels

1029
00:46:24.233 --> 00:46:26.068
that connected them all together were like

1030
00:46:26.068 --> 00:46:29.438
electromagnetic tracks with levitation properties

1031
00:46:29.438 --> 00:46:31.473
that you could move stuff with absolute ease

1032
00:46:31.473 --> 00:46:35.012
between this entire huge grid.

1033
00:46:35.012 --> 00:46:38.447
And it would have been used for heat, for light,

1034
00:46:38.447 --> 00:46:39.314
for everything.

1035
00:46:39.314 --> 00:46:40.850
And this is what we now come into,

1036
00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:42.753
well what is it that they used?

1037
00:46:42.753 --> 00:46:44.555
It's just a frequency.

1038
00:46:44.555 --> 00:46:46.921
And this is what it comes down to.

1039
00:46:46.921 --> 00:46:49.291
And frequency seems to be the answer to everything.

1040
00:46:49.291 --> 00:46:51.028
Frequency is energy.

1041
00:46:51.028 --> 00:46:53.028
Frequency equals energy.

1042
00:46:53.028 --> 00:46:54.963
And that's a big thing for us, a big hurdle

1043
00:46:54.963 --> 00:46:58.300
for us to cross and start to think about it in those terms.

1044
00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:01.437
I just want to come back to the question that you raised

1045
00:47:01.437 --> 00:47:03.071
about the magnatron.

1046
00:47:03.071 --> 00:47:06.541
Because it's in the magnatron that we find

1047
00:47:06.541 --> 00:47:07.743
the real understanding.

1048
00:47:07.743 --> 00:47:10.083
And a magnatron for those people that don't know

1049
00:47:10.083 --> 00:47:11.714
is a device that we use today.

1050
00:47:11.714 --> 00:47:13.848
Every microwave's got a magnatron.

1051
00:47:13.848 --> 00:47:16.685
And that's probably the best description.

1052
00:47:16.685 --> 00:47:19.655
It's a very, very, the magnatron in a microwave is tiny.

1053
00:47:19.655 --> 00:47:21.089
It's about this size.

1054
00:47:21.089 --> 00:47:25.628
And it generates a tremendous amount of energy.

1055
00:47:25.628 --> 00:47:29.898
It can be destructive energy or it could be positive energy.

1056
00:47:29.898 --> 00:47:31.568
It depends on how you use it,

1057
00:47:31.568 --> 00:47:33.607
or how you change the frequency,

1058
00:47:33.607 --> 00:47:37.339
what frequency you choose to create with that magnatron.

1059
00:47:37.339 --> 00:47:40.776
These guys were building magnatrons

1060
00:47:40.776 --> 00:47:43.612
that are 30 meters, 50 meters in diameter.

1061
00:47:43.612 --> 00:47:45.413
Not little things like this.

1062
00:47:45.413 --> 00:47:47.348
<v Regina>One can only fathom the energy</v>

1063
00:47:47.348 --> 00:47:48.752
that was being created.

1064
00:47:48.752 --> 00:47:50.986
<v ->Exactly, and the work they were doing is</v>

1065
00:47:50.986 --> 00:47:54.390
first of all they were tapping into this energy

1066
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:57.258
in the surface of planet Earth.

1067
00:47:57.258 --> 00:47:59.961
And they were then tapping that out of the Earth

1068
00:47:59.961 --> 00:48:04.961
and amplifying that energy with this magnatron shape

1069
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.435
and then channeling it down into those channels

1070
00:48:07.435 --> 00:48:09.871
thousands of miles of channels for the use,

1071
00:48:09.871 --> 00:48:13.298
whatever they were doing with it.

1072
00:48:13.298 --> 00:48:16.445
Now we get to the whole frequency thing.

1073
00:48:16.445 --> 00:48:18.213
And suddenly the whole frequency thing

1074
00:48:18.213 --> 00:48:21.217
becomes really, really important.

1075
00:48:21.217 --> 00:48:24.953
In South Africa there's a guy that is using frequency

1076
00:48:24.953 --> 00:48:29.190
to cure all disease and to eradicate pests

1077
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:31.726
and viruses and so forth.

1078
00:48:31.726 --> 00:48:33.828
<v Regina>Kind of like Rife?</v>

1079
00:48:33.828 --> 00:48:35.798
<v ->Like a Royal Raymond Rife.</v>

1080
00:48:35.798 --> 00:48:38.601
I think he's taken it to a much higher level that Rife.

1081
00:48:38.601 --> 00:48:42.837
And he's still alive, and I hope that he comes out

1082
00:48:42.837 --> 00:48:44.908
with his information very soon

1083
00:48:44.908 --> 00:48:47.609
and shares it with the world before they take him out.

1084
00:48:49.945 --> 00:48:51.980
And it's incredible what's he's doing.

1085
00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:53.516
I don't want to say much more about him,

1086
00:48:53.516 --> 00:48:56.019
because I fear it might.

1087
00:48:56.019 --> 00:48:57.357
<v Regina>But this is an example of the use</v>

1088
00:48:57.357 --> 00:49:00.222
of frequencies for the benefit of mankind

1089
00:49:00.222 --> 00:49:01.823
rather than against mankind.

1090
00:49:01.823 --> 00:49:03.627
<v ->He's been doing this for over 10 years,</v>

1091
00:49:03.627 --> 00:49:05.026
maybe about 12 years.

1092
00:49:05.026 --> 00:49:05.795
<v Regina>Humankind.</v>

1093
00:49:05.795 --> 00:49:08.936
<v ->Exactly, humankind.</v>

1094
00:49:08.936 --> 00:49:11.601
And this chap has been doing this for about 12 years

1095
00:49:11.601 --> 00:49:15.677
or so now and he told me that for the last four years

1096
00:49:15.677 --> 00:49:18.640
he has not used any kind of energy or electricity

1097
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.208
supplied by the government.

1098
00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:24.049
He just taps into the energy around him

1099
00:49:24.049 --> 00:49:26.148
and from the Earth.

1100
00:49:26.148 --> 00:49:30.320
So he's clearly broken the mold and he's crossed

1101
00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.220
the dividing line,

1102
00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:34.757
understanding that energy is all around us.

1103
00:49:34.757 --> 00:49:36.225
And we get told this all the time.

1104
00:49:36.225 --> 00:49:39.328
We get told that you can't destroy energy.

1105
00:49:39.328 --> 00:49:41.029
Energy is everywhere in the universe.

1106
00:49:41.029 --> 00:49:43.499
Then on the next hand you say well you see,

1107
00:49:43.499 --> 00:49:45.468
it's expensive to create electricity.

1108
00:49:45.468 --> 00:49:50.205
Because we've been so dumbed down and blinded

1109
00:49:50.205 --> 00:49:51.973
and we're told that electricity is energy.

1110
00:49:51.973 --> 00:49:53.108
Well, that's not energy.

1111
00:49:53.108 --> 00:49:56.549
Electricity is a form, deadly form of energy

1112
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:59.381
that has been created in that specific fashion

1113
00:49:59.381 --> 00:50:02.751
so they can control it and they can measure it,

1114
00:50:02.751 --> 00:50:04.053
and they can...

1115
00:50:04.053 --> 00:50:04.954
<v Regina>Charge us for it.</v>

1116
00:50:04.954 --> 00:50:06.422
<v ->And most importantly charge us for it.</v>

1117
00:50:06.422 --> 00:50:08.190
But they can control where it goes.

1118
00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:11.460
Because free energy is everywhere,

1119
00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:12.995
and it's free to everyone.

1120
00:50:12.995 --> 00:50:15.364
<v Regina>And I can tell just from your body language</v>

1121
00:50:15.364 --> 00:50:16.708
and the look on your face this is really

1122
00:50:16.708 --> 00:50:19.234
what's so exciting to you about this discovery.

1123
00:50:19.234 --> 00:50:20.301
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1124
00:50:20.301 --> 00:50:22.014
<v Regina>I mean, other than the obvious implications</v>

1125
00:50:22.014 --> 00:50:25.241
about the age of the species and all of that

1126
00:50:25.241 --> 00:50:27.244
from anthropological terms.

1127
00:50:27.244 --> 00:50:31.247
But really, we have here massive natural

1128
00:50:31.247 --> 00:50:34.488
earth-based energy generators.

1129
00:50:34.488 --> 00:50:37.220
<v ->They align, over a million, over 10 million of them</v>

1130
00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:39.809
lying in southern Africa.

1131
00:50:39.809 --> 00:50:41.357
And they're still alive.

1132
00:50:41.357 --> 00:50:42.694
<v Regina>I was going to ask you,</v>

1133
00:50:42.694 --> 00:50:43.729
they have to be active.

1134
00:50:43.729 --> 00:50:44.903
Now can you talk about that,

1135
00:50:44.903 --> 00:50:47.703
some measurements that have been done?

1136
00:50:47.703 --> 00:50:51.867
<v ->Well, it was actually by accident that this happened.</v>

1137
00:50:51.867 --> 00:50:54.780
This guy went out and he measured the energies in them

1138
00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:56.971
via another guy that I know.

1139
00:50:56.971 --> 00:50:59.075
And he e-mailed me, SMS'ed me and said

1140
00:50:59.075 --> 00:51:00.680
by the way, we went to the rings today

1141
00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:01.882
and we measured the energy.

1142
00:51:01.882 --> 00:51:03.750
You won't believe what we measured.

1143
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:05.917
I was on tour somewhere and I phoned him back

1144
00:51:05.917 --> 00:51:07.816
and I said no, no what do you mean?

1145
00:51:07.816 --> 00:51:08.760
You've got to tell me this.

1146
00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:10.894
This is important stuff, because they didn't know

1147
00:51:10.894 --> 00:51:12.423
what I know.

1148
00:51:12.423 --> 00:51:15.365
They thought that this was an interesting little fun thing

1149
00:51:15.365 --> 00:51:16.881
that they measured.

1150
00:51:16.881 --> 00:51:19.012
They didn't quite know what to do with it.

1151
00:51:19.012 --> 00:51:23.372
And when I heard that they measured specific frequencies

1152
00:51:23.372 --> 00:51:25.675
in the ruins, I went crazy.

1153
00:51:25.675 --> 00:51:27.369
And I was on tour somewhere and I phoned them back

1154
00:51:27.369 --> 00:51:29.471
and I said what do you mean you measured frequency?

1155
00:51:29.471 --> 00:51:30.739
Tell me what you measured?

1156
00:51:30.739 --> 00:51:34.009
And he told me we measured 14 1/2 gigahertz at 72 db.

1157
00:51:34.009 --> 00:51:35.911
And I said where did you measure it?

1158
00:51:35.911 --> 00:51:37.613
And he said, well in that ruin over there.

1159
00:51:37.613 --> 00:51:39.748
When I got back, I called the guy that measured it.

1160
00:51:39.748 --> 00:51:43.018
Now this is a guy that's ex-centic.

1161
00:51:43.018 --> 00:51:45.121
He worked for the company in South Africa

1162
00:51:45.121 --> 00:51:47.606
that sets up all the satellite

1163
00:51:47.606 --> 00:51:51.330
and the satellite distribution transmissions

1164
00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:55.064
for all the television and radio stations

1165
00:51:55.064 --> 00:51:58.609
that control broadcasting in southern Africa.

1166
00:51:58.609 --> 00:52:00.708
And he is an expert in this kind of stuff.

1167
00:52:00.708 --> 00:52:03.348
He's got state-of-the-art equipment

1168
00:52:03.348 --> 00:52:04.840
to measure this stuff with.

1169
00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:07.047
And he told me when he measured, he explained to me

1170
00:52:07.047 --> 00:52:08.810
the whole, full detail of how he measured it

1171
00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:11.147
and when he measured it and what he measured.

1172
00:52:11.147 --> 00:52:14.484
And what he measured was 14 1/2 gigahertz

1173
00:52:14.484 --> 00:52:17.252
at 72 decibels coming out of the walls

1174
00:52:17.252 --> 00:52:19.369
on this one specific ruin.

1175
00:52:19.369 --> 00:52:22.070
And then he told me he measured another weird

1176
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:25.661
kind of energy field that's coming out of the ground.

1177
00:52:25.661 --> 00:52:27.701
Moving out of the ground into the sky.

1178
00:52:27.701 --> 00:52:29.444
That's a whole 'nother thing that they measured.

1179
00:52:29.444 --> 00:52:32.136
It's like a vortex effect that is created

1180
00:52:32.136 --> 00:52:34.903
because of the energy field in the walls.

1181
00:52:34.903 --> 00:52:38.307
Obviously you're creating an electromagnetic effect.

1182
00:52:38.307 --> 00:52:42.844
And then he said the thing that really got me,

1183
00:52:42.844 --> 00:52:45.848
is oh and by the way I know where the next (unclear)

1184
00:52:45.848 --> 00:52:47.616
is, I know where the next stone circle is.

1185
00:52:47.616 --> 00:52:49.296
And I said oh, how do you know this?

1186
00:52:49.296 --> 00:52:51.327
He says because there's like a field of energy

1187
00:52:51.327 --> 00:52:54.156
that goes from this circle over there.

1188
00:52:54.156 --> 00:52:57.065
Then I saw there was another circle lying over there.

1189
00:52:57.065 --> 00:53:00.895
So, there's a channel of energy that goes

1190
00:53:00.895 --> 00:53:03.225
from this circle to that circle.

1191
00:53:03.225 --> 00:53:05.743
And he didn't know at that stage that I've figured out

1192
00:53:05.743 --> 00:53:09.608
that the channels were the links for the flow of energy

1193
00:53:09.608 --> 00:53:11.149
between the circles.

1194
00:53:11.149 --> 00:53:13.293
So with me prompting him in any way,

1195
00:53:13.293 --> 00:53:16.512
he actually told me that's exactly what was happening.

1196
00:53:16.512 --> 00:53:18.806
<v Regina>Wow, what wonderful validation.</v>

1197
00:53:18.806 --> 00:53:22.679
Just to wrap this part of our conversation up.

1198
00:53:22.679 --> 00:53:27.679
We have an advanced species who cloned the beginning

1199
00:53:27.727 --> 00:53:31.328
of modern man, modern woman and man species,

1200
00:53:31.328 --> 00:53:32.365
human species.

1201
00:53:32.365 --> 00:53:34.062
<v ->Well, I'm going to correct you there.</v>

1202
00:53:34.062 --> 00:53:36.577
The first few thousand years it was all male.

1203
00:53:36.577 --> 00:53:37.452
<v Regina>Oh, was it all male?</v>

1204
00:53:37.452 --> 00:53:38.436
Because it was cloning.

1205
00:53:38.436 --> 00:53:40.374
<v ->Yeah, it was cloning, it was all male.</v>

1206
00:53:40.374 --> 00:53:41.312
And that's...

1207
00:53:41.312 --> 00:53:42.914
<v Regina>True, you wanted the big, strong bodies.</v>

1208
00:53:42.914 --> 00:53:45.879
<v ->Because they were cloning them.</v>

1209
00:53:45.879 --> 00:53:47.409
They were just cloning male species.

1210
00:53:47.409 --> 00:53:50.720
And then when they couldn't clone them fast enough

1211
00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:54.282
that's when they said let's make a female

1212
00:53:54.282 --> 00:53:55.618
so they can procreate on their own

1213
00:53:55.618 --> 00:53:57.602
and breed quicker.

1214
00:53:57.602 --> 00:53:59.248
<v Regina>Well thank you for correcting me on that.</v>

1215
00:53:59.248 --> 00:54:00.885
I hadn't heard that before.

1216
00:54:00.885 --> 00:54:02.767
Maybe I hadn't read the fine print yet in your book.

1217
00:54:02.767 --> 00:54:03.594
But thank you.

1218
00:54:03.594 --> 00:54:04.629
<v ->No, it's important.</v>

1219
00:54:04.629 --> 00:54:06.261
That's why they created the sixth chromosome.

1220
00:54:06.261 --> 00:54:09.665
So I suspect if we ever, and when we find

1221
00:54:09.665 --> 00:54:11.466
the human remains of these early beings

1222
00:54:11.466 --> 00:54:14.236
they're only going to have 22 pairs of chromosomes,

1223
00:54:14.236 --> 00:54:15.505
and not 23.

1224
00:54:15.505 --> 00:54:18.545
And that's going to be a huge revelation as well.

1225
00:54:18.545 --> 00:54:21.086
<v Regina>Okay, so mankind developing into humankind.</v>

1226
00:54:21.086 --> 00:54:23.826
We have this gold mining species that was using

1227
00:54:23.826 --> 00:54:25.148
very advanced technology because the beings

1228
00:54:25.148 --> 00:54:27.816
that were present and manipulating

1229
00:54:27.816 --> 00:54:29.203
and orchestrating all these events

1230
00:54:29.203 --> 00:54:30.755
understood the technology.

1231
00:54:30.755 --> 00:54:33.099
And the remnants are left there for us now

1232
00:54:33.099 --> 00:54:36.391
to rediscover, to reverse engineer or utilize

1233
00:54:36.391 --> 00:54:40.969
in a helpful manner for the future of our species.

1234
00:54:40.969 --> 00:54:41.738
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1235
00:54:41.738 --> 00:54:44.739
<v Regina>But, from here we're going to continue</v>

1236
00:54:44.739 --> 00:54:48.370
the conversation into another area completely.

1237
00:54:48.370 --> 00:54:50.138
Any other final thoughts on this before we wrap

1238
00:54:50.138 --> 00:54:52.541
this part of the conversation up?

1239
00:54:52.541 --> 00:54:55.417
<v ->What the early civilization has given us</v>

1240
00:54:55.417 --> 00:54:57.378
is two very important things.

1241
00:54:57.378 --> 00:55:00.262
The understanding for us to look at free energy,

1242
00:55:00.262 --> 00:55:02.117
tapping it out of the earth, as you said.

1243
00:55:02.117 --> 00:55:06.354
And this is our main obsession today is to find free energy.

1244
00:55:06.354 --> 00:55:08.858
And the obsession of the Illuminati to keep that surpressed

1245
00:55:08.858 --> 00:55:10.272
as long as they can.

1246
00:55:10.272 --> 00:55:12.944
Well, we're learning it from the first people on Earth,

1247
00:55:12.944 --> 00:55:14.195
the first civilizations.

1248
00:55:14.195 --> 00:55:18.604
And at the same time it seems like the first 270,000 years

1249
00:55:18.604 --> 00:55:22.189
of the human race, the existence of homo sapiens

1250
00:55:22.189 --> 00:55:25.140
in their mining slave colonies in southern Africa

1251
00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:27.709
was almost a Utopian kind of lifestyle,

1252
00:55:27.709 --> 00:55:32.388
very similar to what I believe is what I now

1253
00:55:32.388 --> 00:55:35.151
am trying to propose, this new social structure

1254
00:55:35.151 --> 00:55:36.518
called contributionism.

1255
00:55:36.518 --> 00:55:38.130
Very close to that, it's interesting.

1256
00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:39.821
So two important things that we learned

1257
00:55:39.821 --> 00:55:41.256
from the first people.

1258
00:55:41.256 --> 00:55:46.256
Free energy and the foundation of a contributionist society.

1259
00:55:46.653 --> 00:55:49.971
<v Regina>On that note, thank you so much, Michael.</v>

1260
00:55:49.971 --> 00:55:51.757
And we'll continue our conversation.

1261
00:55:51.757 --> 00:55:53.554
<v ->Thanks, Regina.</v>

1262
00:55:55.447 --> 00:55:57.138
<v ->The key to Michael's interest is his belief</v>

1263
00:55:57.138 --> 00:55:59.551
that these stone structures provided clean,

1264
00:55:59.551 --> 00:56:03.821
limitless energy to those living nearly 300,000 years ago.

1265
00:56:03.821 --> 00:56:06.558
If this kind of energy can be harnessed once again,

1266
00:56:06.558 --> 00:56:10.296
humankind has the potential to create society anew

1267
00:56:10.296 --> 00:56:12.064
without the need for money.

1268
00:56:12.064 --> 00:56:14.420
This led us to our next conversation

1269
00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:16.714
in which he tells us of his laudable plans

1270
00:56:16.714 --> 00:56:18.968
for contributionism in South Africa.

1271
00:56:18.968 --> 00:56:20.763
It's a brilliant conversation.

1272
00:56:20.763 --> 00:56:23.885
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
