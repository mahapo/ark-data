(piano music)

2
00:00:06.827 --> 00:00:09.108
<v ->If you were to look at one single factor</v>

3
00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:11.987
that creates more fear than any other on a global scale

4
00:00:11.987 --> 00:00:13.867
it would certainly be money.

5
00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:15.567
So it's no surprise that most of us

6
00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:18.967
have varying degrees of unhealthy relationships with money.

7
00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:20.747
Either fear of not having enough

8
00:00:20.747 --> 00:00:22.847
or losing what we have.

9
00:00:22.847 --> 00:00:24.967
Karen McCall was in dire straits

10
00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:27.508
when she was forced to deal with her money demons.

11
00:00:27.508 --> 00:00:30.988
It turned into a deep spiritual process of self evaluation

12
00:00:30.988 --> 00:00:33.347
that was in turn the start of a career

13
00:00:33.347 --> 00:00:35.388
in helping others to shine the light

14
00:00:35.388 --> 00:00:36.928
on their own money bogey man.

15
00:00:36.928 --> 00:00:40.127
All of which she shares in her book Financial Recovery.

16
00:00:40.127 --> 00:00:42.794
<v  Voiceover>Karen, I'm so happy to be talking</v>

17
00:00:42.794 --> 00:00:43.813
to you about this

18
00:00:43.813 --> 00:00:45.653
because many of the people watching right now

19
00:00:45.653 --> 00:00:49.733
probably have an unhealthy relationship with money.

20
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:54.093
Whether it's under earning, just denying that we're in debt,

21
00:00:54.093 --> 00:00:55.043
not wanting to look at

22
00:00:55.043 --> 00:00:57.303
because we can't figure our way out of it,

23
00:00:57.303 --> 00:00:59.103
or not saving.

24
00:00:59.103 --> 00:01:00.903
It seems the most people have some kind of

25
00:01:00.903 --> 00:01:02.543
dysfunction around this,

26
00:01:02.543 --> 00:01:05.303
and these times have been challenging for people

27
00:01:05.303 --> 00:01:06.823
with the loss of work,

28
00:01:06.823 --> 00:01:08.183
but you were challenged.

29
00:01:08.183 --> 00:01:10.223
You weren't always this together.

30
00:01:10.223 --> 00:01:11.263
<v ->Right.</v>

31
00:01:11.263 --> 00:01:13.083
<v Voiceover>Take you back a couple decades</v>

32
00:01:13.083 --> 00:01:14.463
and you were very un-together.

33
00:01:14.463 --> 00:01:16.443
Let's talk about how traumatic your relationship

34
00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:19.283
with money was that really launched you on this path.

35
00:01:19.283 --> 00:01:22.003
<v ->Regina, if you would have known me 27 years ago,</v>

36
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:23.943
what you would have seen

37
00:01:23.943 --> 00:01:25.863
was a successful looking business woman,

38
00:01:25.863 --> 00:01:27.463
hopping in a car every morning

39
00:01:27.463 --> 00:01:29.703
driving to San Francisco's financial district.

40
00:01:29.703 --> 00:01:31.903
Before I would board the elevator

41
00:01:31.903 --> 00:01:33.763
that would take me to the 31st floor.

42
00:01:33.763 --> 00:01:36.883
I'd stop and get my latte and my big bran muffin,

43
00:01:36.883 --> 00:01:38.760
and if you would have seen me,

44
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.900
you would have thought, "Wow, what a success."

45
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.380
You know, this corner office with a view

46
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.780
of the fantastic San Francisco Bay.

47
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.440
However, I had a big secret.

48
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.100
And that secret was that at home

49
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.820
on top of my refrigerator

50
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.660
I had this big bowl of bills,

51
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.260
unopened bills,

52
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.400
and several from the IRS.

53
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.080
It was just the most painful time in my life.

54
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.600
No one would have guessed that I was

55
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.081
on the verge of financial ruin.

56
00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:03.380
<v Regina>Did you tell anyone?</v>

57
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.820
Did you share this with anyone?

58
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.720
<v ->I didn't, I was dating a guy at the time.</v>

59
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.060
A man named Tom,

60
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.601
and he suspected.

61
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:11.100
He was too polite to ever bring it up,

62
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.600
but he would show up at my house,

63
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.000
at my apartment rather with these audio binders

64
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.060
of audio cassettes, self help audio cassettes.

65
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.720
And I would just pile them up on my floor.

66
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.960
But I never had a dime to contribute to

67
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.581
even a cup of coffee that we had,

68
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:28.600
and he definitely suspected there was a problem.

69
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.580
<v Regina>And you were earning right?</v>

70
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.400
<v ->I was earning money.</v>

71
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.120
<v Regina>You were earning money,</v>

72
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.152
but what were you doing with that money?

73
00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:34.372
<v ->Well this is the thing.</v>

74
00:02:34.372 --> 00:02:36.032
I had been married before.

75
00:02:36.032 --> 00:02:37.553
My kids were off to college,

76
00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:41.692
and so I had a fairly sizable amount of money,

77
00:02:41.692 --> 00:02:43.153
after my divorce.

78
00:02:43.153 --> 00:02:46.872
However, I was alone for the first time in my life.

79
00:02:46.872 --> 00:02:48.773
I had never learned about money,

80
00:02:48.773 --> 00:02:52.032
and I felt way too embarrassed and too ashamed

81
00:02:52.032 --> 00:02:54.232
to let anybody know that I didn't know.

82
00:02:54.232 --> 00:02:56.733
So I just watched my savings go down,

83
00:02:56.733 --> 00:02:58.412
and during the 80s you know,

84
00:02:58.412 --> 00:03:00.412
the earliest easy time to get credit.

85
00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:01.392
<v Regina>Yes, that's when it started.</v>

86
00:03:01.392 --> 00:03:02.792
<v ->So I got the credit cards,</v>

87
00:03:02.792 --> 00:03:05.412
and it was just, I was just in this money coma.

88
00:03:05.412 --> 00:03:09.280
Just unconscious of the reality of what was happening to me.

89
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.521
And it wasn't until coming home one day,

90
00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:14.561
and there was an eviction notice on my door,

91
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.918
and that was the time when I said,

92
00:03:17.918 --> 00:03:19.771
"I really have to bring down that bowl."

93
00:03:19.771 --> 00:03:21.550
And the good news is,

94
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.390
I was drawn to that stack of audio cassettes

95
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.390
and I pulled out one that said,

96
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.070
"Possibility Thinking" by Dr. Robert Schuler,

97
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.810
and as I listened to his soothing words,

98
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.750
I mustered the courage to bring down that bowl.

99
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.411
<v Regina>And open those bills?</v>

100
00:03:36.411 --> 00:03:37.910
<v ->Open all those bills.</v>

101
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.530
Throw away all the duplicates.

102
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.871
Made a list of everything I owed.

103
00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:43.530
<v Regina>I mean you had already gotten sobered</v>

104
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.517
enough to do this, so to speak.

105
00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:48.437
However, were you shocked to see what you owed?

106
00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:51.577
<v ->You know, I was shocked to see what I owed,</v>

107
00:03:51.577 --> 00:03:52.937
but it was such a relief Regina,

108
00:03:52.937 --> 00:03:55.308
because not knowing,

109
00:03:55.308 --> 00:03:57.188
that not knowing and just worrying.

110
00:03:57.188 --> 00:04:00.908
Even though I was numbing myself in many different ways,

111
00:04:00.908 --> 00:04:02.808
and just not paying attention to it,

112
00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:05.148
it did impact my sleep,

113
00:04:05.148 --> 00:04:06.988
my sense of self-esteem.

114
00:04:06.988 --> 00:04:08.988
I couldn't breath.

115
00:04:08.988 --> 00:04:10.388
You know, I couldn't breath.

116
00:04:10.388 --> 00:04:13.888
It was just a very, very stressful, stressful time for me.

117
00:04:13.888 --> 00:04:16.548
<v Regina>Sure, and I think a lot of people</v>

118
00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:17.688
can relate to that.

119
00:04:17.688 --> 00:04:20.168
What was interesting is because at that time

120
00:04:20.168 --> 00:04:22.408
credit was becoming available, right?

121
00:04:22.408 --> 00:04:24.568
But we didn't understand the implications

122
00:04:24.568 --> 00:04:27.528
like we do in 2011

123
00:04:27.528 --> 00:04:30.648
of what it means to not be credit worthy.

124
00:04:30.648 --> 00:04:33.528
After you've gotten drunk on credit for 20, 30 years

125
00:04:33.528 --> 00:04:37.288
that's our savings, we don't even bother to save.

126
00:04:37.288 --> 00:04:38.848
Put it on the card.

127
00:04:38.848 --> 00:04:42.508
That's created a whole different psyche

128
00:04:42.508 --> 00:04:44.008
about this worthiness,

129
00:04:44.008 --> 00:04:45.608
"Oh my god, I'll lose my credit rating."

130
00:04:45.608 --> 00:04:47.148
And we'll get into that in a little bit

131
00:04:47.148 --> 00:04:50.009
because that's part of this kind of drunken debt cycle.

132
00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:51.908
That we've got sucked into.

133
00:04:51.908 --> 00:04:53.308
<v ->It's a really important concept.</v>

134
00:04:53.308 --> 00:04:54.929
I look forward to talking to you about that.

135
00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:57.268
<v Regina>Well I mean, we can go linear on this,</v>

136
00:04:57.268 --> 00:04:59.968
but let's make sure we get back to that.

137
00:04:59.968 --> 00:05:00.828
<v ->Okay.</v>

138
00:05:00.828 --> 00:05:03.649
<v Regina>Okay, so then you had gotten to a point,</v>

139
00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:05.948
I love this part in your book where,

140
00:05:05.948 --> 00:05:08.868
you had to choose between your car payment,

141
00:05:08.868 --> 00:05:11.068
you're a sales person so you had to have a car.

142
00:05:11.068 --> 00:05:12.068
<v ->Right.</v>

143
00:05:12.068 --> 00:05:14.348
<v Regina>And whether or not you could afford your rent.</v>

144
00:05:14.348 --> 00:05:15.888
And then tell us what happened from there.

145
00:05:15.888 --> 00:05:19.148
<v ->Okay, well that night, that I listed all the bills.</v>

146
00:05:19.148 --> 00:05:21.168
Two things became crystal clear.

147
00:05:21.168 --> 00:05:25.028
One was, I couldn't keep my car and my apartment,

148
00:05:25.028 --> 00:05:28.668
and the other thing was I had to come up with money quick.

149
00:05:28.668 --> 00:05:31.696
So I bought a San Francisco chronicle.

150
00:05:31.696 --> 00:05:33.796
I poured over the classifieds,

151
00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:36.796
and I found an ad "Professional Couple in Pacific Heights

152
00:05:36.796 --> 00:05:39.557
"Seeks Cook Five Nights a Week".

153
00:05:39.557 --> 00:05:41.936
And that afternoon, I was in their

154
00:05:41.936 --> 00:05:44.321
beautiful Pacific Heights Mansion

155
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:47.460
interviewing to be their live in cook.

156
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.080
It was a little confusing to them,

157
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.500
but then again I made up a story

158
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.020
about this is an opportunity for me to save and get ahead.

159
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.001
<v Regina>Yeah, you looked a little bit over,</v>

160
00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:56.720
<v ->A little different than most people have.</v>

161
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.200
<v Regina>Who are qualified as their cook.</v>

162
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.560
<v ->Yes, yes, and I had this job in the financial district.</v>

163
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.920
<v Regina>Did you know how to cook?</v>

164
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.960
<v ->I did.</v>

165
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.380
I did know how to cook, yes.

166
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.380
The other thing, was I need to come up with money fast.

167
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.821
So that next Saturday,

168
00:06:12.821 --> 00:06:16.060
I held a sale in the courtyard of my apartment building,

169
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.760
and I sold everything I owned.

170
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.400
You know, 40 years of precious possessions

171
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.180
just gone in an afternoon.

172
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.520
That night I moved into the maid's quarters

173
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.120
of their home in Pacific Heights,

174
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.660
and so you know,

175
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.501
"Hey, headed to the financial district"

176
00:06:31.501 --> 00:06:32.760
and everything looked fine,

177
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.161
but at the end of the day,

178
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:36.880
I would come home, put on an apron,

179
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.940
change out of my business suit,

180
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.741
put on an apron and head to the kitchen.

181
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:43.830
I will tell you, that, did I want that to be a secret,

182
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.700
did I feel shame about that?

183
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.740
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

184
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.380
<v ->Even my daughters, I didn't tell the truth.</v>

185
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.001
I just said, "Again, this is an opportunity for me

186
00:06:52.001 --> 00:06:53.380
"to save money, get ahead."

187
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.280
No, I was in dire straits.

188
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.841
<v Regina>And the low point must have been</v>

189
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:01.400
missing your grandma's funeral.

190
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.100
<v ->Oh my gosh.</v>

191
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.401
That was when I wrote the book,

192
00:07:05.401 --> 00:07:09.740
probably one of the most painful times in my life.

193
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.540
Remembering that story.

194
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.101
That because my credit cards were maxed out,

195
00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:16.980
because I was ashamed to tell anyone,

196
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.760
I was back at a training on the East Coast.

197
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.420
I got the call that my grandmother had died.

198
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.281
My grandma had been the dearest person

199
00:07:26.281 --> 00:07:27.440
in the world to me.

200
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.401
<v Regina>You had a tough childhood?</v>

201
00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:30.480
<v ->I did, and my grandmother was so dear.</v>

202
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.701
I did not have money to come home for her funeral.

203
00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:38.480
I was too embarrassed to ask anyone.

204
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.080
I mean my ex-husband, many relatives,

205
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.300
even my kids would have probably sent me money to come home.

206
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.860
But again, my secret was just,

207
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.300
it was so hard for me to tell the truth, even to myself.

208
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.941
So I missed my grandmother's funeral.

209
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:55.341
One of the things I wanted to say about that is

210
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:57.140
you know we miss opportunities

211
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.801
when we get in financial situations,

212
00:07:58.801 --> 00:08:01.840
and quite often there will be another opportunity,

213
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.060
but that was a lost opportunity.

214
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.620
I can never go to my grandmother's funeral.

215
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.921
That's one of the real painful losses that I really regret.

216
00:08:10.921 --> 00:08:13.820
<v Regina>But this shame thing surrounds money.</v>

217
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.261
If we don't handle it well,

218
00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:16.901
and this can be from someone

219
00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:18.860
making millions of dollars a year,

220
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.620
to someone how has run out of their unemployment benefits.

221
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.820
It doesn't really matter.

222
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.381
It's not discriminating in that way

223
00:08:25.381 --> 00:08:30.280
to have a shameful, unhealthy relationship to money.

224
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.200
Right?

225
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:31.800
<v ->Right,</v>

226
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.661
and I think that when we think about shame,

227
00:08:33.661 --> 00:08:35.881
there's two ways that I like to think about it.

228
00:08:35.881 --> 00:08:39.040
There's the same that comes from the situation

229
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.160
that we found ourselves in.

230
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.840
That we're embarrassed to tell anyone about.

231
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.280
Then there's the shame that we grow up

232
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.461
and we feel inside that we're not worthy.

233
00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:50.520
That there's this emptiness,

234
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.800
the sense of deprivation in our lives.

235
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.860
And so we feel as though there's something wrong with us.

236
00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.380
You know, John Bradshaw, who wrote the forward to my book

237
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.680
had written the book, "Healing the Shame that Binds You."

238
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.080
John Bradshaw talks about the fact

239
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.740
that when we feel this shame,

240
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.801
when we didn't get our needs met when we were small,

241
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:13.260
that we almost feel that we're damaged goods.

242
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.780
That there's something wrong with us,

243
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.820
so we're coming from a shame based place.

244
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.540
And quite often what we will do,

245
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.281
we will create the outside of our life

246
00:09:21.281 --> 00:09:23.340
to match how we feel about ourselves inside.

247
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.980
<v Regina>And this is very subconscious?</v>

248
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.420
<v ->It's subconscious and this is the thing about</v>

249
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.920
when we get into, "Okay, what do people do about it."

250
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.180
We want to get conscious,

251
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.500
because if we have these unconscious motivators

252
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.000
driving our behaviors

253
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.340
and we have no idea that's going on,

254
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.860
and that was certainly part of the case for me.

255
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.981
That it's very difficult to really change our situation.

256
00:09:46.981 --> 00:09:49.560
We wonder, "Gee, I'm smart.

257
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.600
"Why can't I turn this around?"

258
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.680
So shame is that there's something wrong with me

259
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.981
and also the shame that our public shame,

260
00:09:58.981 --> 00:10:00.580
you know, the credit report.

261
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.480
Our friends knowing that we've lost homes,

262
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.640
and all of the different things

263
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.720
that have happened to people.

264
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.121
<v Regina>Yes, and you point out in the book</v>

265
00:10:07.121 --> 00:10:08.761
those feelings of unworthiness,

266
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:12.040
they can turn into any number of dysfuntions

267
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.540
in our relationship with money.

268
00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.480
But one of them would be overspending,

269
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.941
because we don't feel full in and of ourselves.

270
00:10:18.941 --> 00:10:21.801
We have to fill that bucket with stuff.

271
00:10:21.801 --> 00:10:22.681
<v ->Right.</v>

272
00:10:22.681 --> 00:10:24.141
<v Regina>But it's not satisfying.</v>

273
00:10:24.141 --> 00:10:25.561
<v ->Well you've heard the saying,</v>

274
00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:28.601
"You can never get enough of what you don't need."

275
00:10:28.601 --> 00:10:30.240
<v Regina>I wrote that down and I love that.</v>

276
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.861
You can never get enough of what you don't need.

277
00:10:32.861 --> 00:10:34.171
<v ->Right, and whenever I'm speaking</v>

278
00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:35.670
people always say, "will you repeat that again please?"

279
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.090
Because people know that it resonates at some level.

280
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.310
So if there is this emptiness

281
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:42.930
and that's driving our behavior

282
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.730
one of the things that we'll do

283
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.870
is we'll think, "Oh, I want this.

284
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:47.970
"This will make me feel good."

285
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.710
And the advertising companies know this.

286
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:54.510
They know how to appeal to that emptiness,

287
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.250
and say, "If we buy this and we get this,

288
00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:00.650
"or we do this, this is going to make us be okay."

289
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.090
And if people don't know what they really need

290
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.930
they're very susceptible to giving into that kind of thing.

291
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.570
Hence credit cards spending beyond our means.

292
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.930
But more importantly, spending on things

293
00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.550
that don't really matter to us.

294
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.930
So you can never get enough,

295
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.550
because you're not satisfied.

296
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.550
<v Regina>You can never have enough shoes</v>

297
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:18.430
if you're a shoe freak.

298
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:18.976
I mean it's never going to be enough.

299
00:11:18.976 --> 00:11:21.996
This is really a psycho-spiritual issue

300
00:11:21.996 --> 00:11:23.616
when you get down to it.

301
00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:26.176
<v ->That's been my experience,</v>

302
00:11:26.176 --> 00:11:27.596
and in fact the very first category

303
00:11:27.596 --> 00:11:30.296
I have on my spending plan is spiritual growth.

304
00:11:30.296 --> 00:11:33.676
I would not have been able to take this journey

305
00:11:33.676 --> 00:11:35.496
if I hadn't looked at it that way.

306
00:11:35.496 --> 00:11:36.996
If I would have thought it's just about

307
00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:39.016
the numbers, the dollars and cents of it all.

308
00:11:39.016 --> 00:11:42.796
To me when I look back and think about the life I've had,

309
00:11:42.796 --> 00:11:44.936
which you know hasn't been a pretty life.

310
00:11:44.936 --> 00:11:47.176
<v Regina>Certainly not the early years.</v>

311
00:11:47.176 --> 00:11:48.136
<v ->Not the early years,</v>

312
00:11:48.136 --> 00:11:51.996
and I have to say, this led me to the most amazing work.

313
00:11:51.996 --> 00:11:54.976
The work that I just absolutely love.

314
00:11:54.976 --> 00:11:56.936
And I lost my train of thought.

315
00:11:56.936 --> 00:11:58.216
<v Regina>That's okay.</v>

316
00:11:58.216 --> 00:11:59.456
<v ->Where was I?</v>

317
00:11:59.456 --> 00:12:01.216
<v Regina>Oh the spiritual part.</v>

318
00:12:01.216 --> 00:12:02.236
<v ->The spiritual part,</v>

319
00:12:02.236 --> 00:12:04.336
and so some people get sick,

320
00:12:04.336 --> 00:12:06.776
and that will become a spiritual journey for them.

321
00:12:06.776 --> 00:12:09.756
This was a type of disease if you will.

322
00:12:09.756 --> 00:12:11.836
An addiction, a lot of addictive behaviors,

323
00:12:11.836 --> 00:12:15.136
and as I fell apart financially,

324
00:12:15.136 --> 00:12:17.276
there was only one thing to do.

325
00:12:17.276 --> 00:12:20.116
Either give up, and a lot of people do that.

326
00:12:20.116 --> 00:12:21.636
You know, they head for the bridge,

327
00:12:21.636 --> 00:12:23.296
they end their life, they go to prison,

328
00:12:23.296 --> 00:12:24.876
a lot of bad things can happen.

329
00:12:24.876 --> 00:12:29.516
Or you say, "Okay, I cannot do this on my own."

330
00:12:29.516 --> 00:12:32.156
And so there's a surrendering, a giving up

331
00:12:32.156 --> 00:12:35.836
that anyone who has any kind of addiction going on,

332
00:12:35.836 --> 00:12:38.196
they have to get to that point of,

333
00:12:38.196 --> 00:12:40.576
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.

334
00:12:40.576 --> 00:12:43.519
Then a willingness to surrender and say,

335
00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:46.519
"There really is something outside of me.

336
00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:51.299
"That I need to surrender to and draw strength from."

337
00:12:51.299 --> 00:12:53.739
That can be nature, people can call that God,

338
00:12:53.739 --> 00:12:55.979
their higher power, whatever they want to call it,

339
00:12:55.979 --> 00:12:59.159
but where they know that there's help out there,

340
00:12:59.159 --> 00:13:02.128
that's more than just the dollars and cents help.

341
00:13:02.128 --> 00:13:04.068
<v Regina>One of the stories in your book</v>

342
00:13:04.068 --> 00:13:06.168
that was really profoundly sad

343
00:13:06.168 --> 00:13:07.748
was about the young girl

344
00:13:07.748 --> 00:13:11.528
who had committed suicide in college age or not too old,

345
00:13:11.528 --> 00:13:14.228
who had committed suicide and had left a note

346
00:13:14.228 --> 00:13:17.508
because she had become overwhelmed with debt

347
00:13:17.508 --> 00:13:19.728
and had on her bed all her bills laid out.

348
00:13:19.728 --> 00:13:20.458
<v ->Yes.</v>

349
00:13:20.458 --> 00:13:21.122
<v Regina>That she couldn't pay</v>

350
00:13:21.122 --> 00:13:22.442
and that just brought tears to my eyes.

351
00:13:22.442 --> 00:13:25.702
To think a young girl would allow debt

352
00:13:25.702 --> 00:13:28.762
and shame around debt to take her own life.

353
00:13:28.762 --> 00:13:30.122
This is not uncommon.

354
00:13:30.122 --> 00:13:31.422
<v ->This is not uncommon,</v>

355
00:13:31.422 --> 00:13:33.222
and this was a college girl.

356
00:13:33.222 --> 00:13:34.582
Her mother was on a panel.

357
00:13:34.582 --> 00:13:35.822
I watched her on television

358
00:13:35.822 --> 00:13:39.122
and she said, "I wish she would have come to me."

359
00:13:39.122 --> 00:13:41.302
I mean, can you imagine that your kid.

360
00:13:41.302 --> 00:13:44.722
I mean, this is a real permanent solution

361
00:13:44.722 --> 00:13:49.122
to something that didn't have to be a permanent problem.

362
00:13:49.122 --> 00:13:52.402
So very, very sad when people are that isolated,

363
00:13:52.402 --> 00:13:53.802
that alone, that fearful,

364
00:13:53.802 --> 00:13:56.402
that they would end their life

365
00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:58.122
rather than face their problem.

366
00:13:58.122 --> 00:13:59.622
<v Regina>And when you look at it</v>

367
00:13:59.622 --> 00:14:01.702
from a spiritual point of view,

368
00:14:01.702 --> 00:14:03.802
and I mean it from the highest sense,

369
00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:07.042
whether you call your other part your soul,

370
00:14:07.042 --> 00:14:10.502
your spirit, your higher self,

371
00:14:10.502 --> 00:14:13.452
whatever we call the aspect of us

372
00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:14.805
that transcends physical life,

373
00:14:14.805 --> 00:14:19.127
that has incredible need for expression and creativity

374
00:14:19.127 --> 00:14:21.267
is highly intelligent aspect of each one of us,

375
00:14:21.267 --> 00:14:26.267
that part wasn't, that part isn't,

376
00:14:26.717 --> 00:14:31.717
doesn't resonate with units of currency by nature.

377
00:14:31.891 --> 00:14:35.351
That part of us is just purely expressive.

378
00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:39.911
It's come to learn and to experience life on this planet,

379
00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:42.992
and here we are in a system that binds everyone

380
00:14:42.992 --> 00:14:45.051
to units of currency.

381
00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:46.911
Now you can get into conspiracy theory

382
00:14:46.911 --> 00:14:48.032
and all kinds of stuff around this,

383
00:14:48.032 --> 00:14:49.461
but we don't need to go there.

384
00:14:49.461 --> 00:14:51.384
Everyone of us understands this.

385
00:14:51.384 --> 00:14:54.124
We're all bound to these units of currency.

386
00:14:54.124 --> 00:14:57.024
Is there a transcendent way to look at it

387
00:14:57.024 --> 00:15:01.384
so it's not just that we're keeping the money machine going

388
00:15:01.384 --> 00:15:04.523
so that others can profit in a conspiratorial sense,

389
00:15:04.523 --> 00:15:07.843
and as you say, when you get into credit card debt,

390
00:15:07.843 --> 00:15:10.244
the house always wins, so there's truth in this.

391
00:15:10.244 --> 00:15:11.183
We get it.

392
00:15:11.183 --> 00:15:15.623
What is a transcending way we can begin looking at money?

393
00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.103
Then I want to start going into

394
00:15:17.103 --> 00:15:18.743
some of the real basics here.

395
00:15:18.743 --> 00:15:22.184
<v ->Well if we think about the fact</v>

396
00:15:22.184 --> 00:15:24.344
that we have this emptiness,

397
00:15:24.344 --> 00:15:26.004
and you know, the emptiness usually

398
00:15:26.004 --> 00:15:28.724
is about wanting some kind of a spiritual connection.

399
00:15:28.724 --> 00:15:32.824
So all of our behaviors are attempting to do this

400
00:15:32.824 --> 00:15:35.364
however you can't meet your spiritual needs

401
00:15:35.364 --> 00:15:37.343
through material means.

402
00:15:37.343 --> 00:15:41.346
However, if we tune in as a beginning,

403
00:15:41.346 --> 00:15:44.286
a way of identifying this deprivation

404
00:15:44.286 --> 00:15:45.946
that exist in our life,

405
00:15:45.946 --> 00:15:49.106
and we may use the money as a way of saying,

406
00:15:49.106 --> 00:15:51.326
"I'm going to start tuning into my needs.

407
00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:53.266
"I'm going to start taking care of myself."

408
00:15:53.266 --> 00:15:55.926
As we take care of this outer deprivation

409
00:15:55.926 --> 00:15:59.046
it does start pushing the person inward,

410
00:15:59.046 --> 00:16:01.486
and they're not so distracted then

411
00:16:01.486 --> 00:16:03.946
by the financial aspect.

412
00:16:03.946 --> 00:16:07.167
Distracted from what they really value

413
00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:08.526
and what's important to them.

414
00:16:08.526 --> 00:16:12.166
So it sort of an inside/outside job,

415
00:16:12.166 --> 00:16:14.107
but also an outside/inside job.

416
00:16:14.107 --> 00:16:16.546
We do have to use the resources we have,

417
00:16:16.546 --> 00:16:18.286
our time, energy, and money

418
00:16:18.286 --> 00:16:20.606
to start healing ourselves

419
00:16:20.606 --> 00:16:22.946
and finding out what our creativity is,

420
00:16:22.946 --> 00:16:24.646
what are our gifts,

421
00:16:24.646 --> 00:16:26.487
what do we want to do in the world.

422
00:16:26.487 --> 00:16:28.727
And if people are in survival mode

423
00:16:28.727 --> 00:16:31.106
and they're worried about how they're going to buy food,

424
00:16:31.106 --> 00:16:33.486
put food on the table, or pay their rent or their mortgage.

425
00:16:33.486 --> 00:16:35.907
It's pretty darn hard to be creative,

426
00:16:35.907 --> 00:16:37.746
and to get to that place.

427
00:16:37.746 --> 00:16:40.026
<v Regina>Absolutely, because this is the hallmark</v>

428
00:16:40.026 --> 00:16:42.906
of having an unhealthy relationship with money.

429
00:16:42.906 --> 00:16:44.426
We're in fear.

430
00:16:44.426 --> 00:16:46.846
We're in overwhelmed,

431
00:16:46.846 --> 00:16:49.787
as you said deprivation, shame,

432
00:16:49.787 --> 00:16:53.006
these are all very counterproductive

433
00:16:53.006 --> 00:16:56.206
when it comes to living a joyful and creative life.

434
00:16:56.206 --> 00:17:00.707
So you say that money for a lot of people

435
00:17:00.707 --> 00:17:01.926
is the bogey man,

436
00:17:01.926 --> 00:17:03.306
it's best left in the dark.

437
00:17:03.306 --> 00:17:04.586
We don't want to deal with it.

438
00:17:04.586 --> 00:17:06.226
Let's start at the beginning of that journey.

439
00:17:06.226 --> 00:17:08.406
<v ->Well fear, you know,</v>

440
00:17:08.406 --> 00:17:09.626
when we think about the bogey man,

441
00:17:09.626 --> 00:17:10.866
we think of ourselves as little kids

442
00:17:10.866 --> 00:17:13.206
kind of afraid in our bedrooms

443
00:17:13.206 --> 00:17:14.626
and the bogey man's in the closet.

444
00:17:14.626 --> 00:17:17.846
So as the parents come in and turn the lights on

445
00:17:17.846 --> 00:17:19.646
and open the closet, and help us see,

446
00:17:19.646 --> 00:17:20.726
Hey, it's not there.

447
00:17:20.726 --> 00:17:22.416
So we have to do a similar thing.

448
00:17:22.416 --> 00:17:25.946
The fear, and anything that kind of grows in the dark.

449
00:17:25.946 --> 00:17:27.806
<v Regina>Like your bills in that bowl.</v>

450
00:17:27.806 --> 00:17:28.536
<v ->Yeah, the bills in the bowl.</v>

451
00:17:28.536 --> 00:17:29.906
<v Regina>On top of the refrigerator.</v>

452
00:17:29.906 --> 00:17:32.666
<v ->And mold, and so we need to shed light,</v>

453
00:17:32.666 --> 00:17:36.866
and we have to know that we're not our debt.

454
00:17:36.866 --> 00:17:39.426
We're not even the money we have.

455
00:17:39.426 --> 00:17:41.746
What we are is we're valuable.

456
00:17:41.746 --> 00:17:44.066
We're worthwhile, we deserve to have

457
00:17:44.066 --> 00:17:47.186
a quality of life that's meaningful and satisfying.

458
00:17:47.186 --> 00:17:50.242
And, so that's where we have to start.

459
00:17:50.242 --> 00:17:52.642
You know, we have to bring things into our consciousness,

460
00:17:52.642 --> 00:17:54.402
into the light, if you will.

461
00:17:54.402 --> 00:17:58.522
And then, it's a combination of saying

462
00:17:58.522 --> 00:18:01.402
I want to get to that place of having

463
00:18:01.402 --> 00:18:04.102
faith and hope that there's going to be

464
00:18:04.102 --> 00:18:05.622
a different outcome for me.

465
00:18:05.622 --> 00:18:09.202
However we have to do the, we have to take the action.

466
00:18:09.202 --> 00:18:11.442
You know, in the book I tell a story about

467
00:18:11.442 --> 00:18:13.502
going down under the Golden Gate bridge one day

468
00:18:13.502 --> 00:18:16.142
when the walls were closing in and I was just so

469
00:18:16.142 --> 00:18:18.582
depressed and just in so much fear.

470
00:18:18.582 --> 00:18:22.562
And I drove out and looking across the bay,

471
00:18:22.562 --> 00:18:25.392
and seeing the Golden Gate Bridge,

472
00:18:25.392 --> 00:18:28.190
and just seeing how incredibly beautiful it was,

473
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.810
I thought this is free and this

474
00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.830
can never be taken away from me.

475
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.990
And in that moment, nothing had changed,

476
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.610
but everything had changed, because I felt

477
00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.050
this bigger connection.

478
00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.550
And I also thought, this is free

479
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.530
and I can come enjoy this anytime.

480
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:51.250
So, when were doing the financial recovery process,

481
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.350
when were working the financial recovery process,

482
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.310
what we wanna do is have people find ways that they

483
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.870
start healing themselves that cost less or no money.

484
00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:03.790
So they don't keep spending and depleting

485
00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.930
their resources without ever touching

486
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:07.170
what their real needs are.

487
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.331
[Regina] Absolutely, that's beautifully stated.

488
00:19:10.331 --> 00:19:12.711
Because this affects everything in our lives.

489
00:19:12.711 --> 00:19:15.171
It affects our relationships, not just with ourselves

490
00:19:15.171 --> 00:19:16.751
but with other people.

491
00:19:16.751 --> 00:19:19.171
As you say, it takes us down roads that we really

492
00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:22.671
would never choose to go down, simply because

493
00:19:22.671 --> 00:19:24.971
we feel in lack and we don't have the means

494
00:19:24.971 --> 00:19:26.571
to get where we wanna go.

495
00:19:26.571 --> 00:19:28.571
So, lets talk about, I think this is a good time

496
00:19:28.571 --> 00:19:31.431
to talk about Laszlo's hierarchy of needs.

497
00:19:31.431 --> 00:19:34.151
Because this is a big one, a lot of people

498
00:19:34.151 --> 00:19:35.871
pay it lip service, oh I'd love to have

499
00:19:35.871 --> 00:19:37.451
a million dollars in the bank.

500
00:19:37.451 --> 00:19:40.711
But, that's not where their thoughts and energy goes.

501
00:19:40.711 --> 00:19:44.211
<v ->Well, it was sorta after the fact, I remember from</v>

502
00:19:44.211 --> 00:19:47.431
college psychology, learning about Abraham Laszlo,

503
00:19:47.431 --> 00:19:50.211
who talks about people who are self actualized.

504
00:19:50.211 --> 00:19:53.771
He says , you know, that we have to take

505
00:19:53.771 --> 00:19:55.651
care of our survival needs first.

506
00:19:55.651 --> 00:20:00.191
Our home, our shelter, our food, water, sex,

507
00:20:00.191 --> 00:20:03.551
and then we move us to our safety and security needs,

508
00:20:03.551 --> 00:20:07.691
and then our self esteem needs, and you know, on and on

509
00:20:07.691 --> 00:20:10.519
so that we get to the place where we are self actualized.

510
00:20:10.519 --> 00:20:12.379
And he studied the people that are

511
00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:15.699
self actulized have met these needs.

512
00:20:15.699 --> 00:20:19.879
And so, I was, after I had been in business a few years,

513
00:20:19.879 --> 00:20:23.379
and realized the success rate of people

514
00:20:23.379 --> 00:20:25.979
healing their relationship with money,

515
00:20:25.979 --> 00:20:28.139
I thought, this is what we've been doing through

516
00:20:28.139 --> 00:20:30.299
the spending plan process and tracking.

517
00:20:30.299 --> 00:20:33.599
People have been working on, first their survival needs,

518
00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:35.819
making sure that they're taking care of those.

519
00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:38.199
Their safety and security needs.

520
00:20:38.199 --> 00:20:40.459
We're looking at where the deprivation

521
00:20:40.459 --> 00:20:44.959
exists in all those areas, and earlier,

522
00:20:44.959 --> 00:20:47.529
when people are in a lot of worried, they're caught more

523
00:20:47.529 --> 00:20:50.229
in a money life drain, where their quality of life,

524
00:20:50.229 --> 00:20:51.989
just becomes narrower and narrower.

525
00:20:51.989 --> 00:20:56.429
So then, Laszlo talks about how do we have

526
00:20:56.429 --> 00:20:58.169
a more expansive life.

527
00:20:58.169 --> 00:21:00.049
And that's what we wanna be able to do,

528
00:21:00.049 --> 00:21:02.909
get to a places where we'e connected with what our

529
00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:04.861
values and what's important to us .

530
00:21:04.861 --> 00:21:07.021
And we're about to use our resources

531
00:21:07.021 --> 00:21:08.701
to have that kind of a life.

532
00:21:08.701 --> 00:21:11.661
So, Laszlo was great to remember,

533
00:21:11.661 --> 00:21:14.021
Oh, I remember Laszlo's hierarchy of needs

534
00:21:14.021 --> 00:21:17.281
and realizing that the work I was doing with people

535
00:21:17.281 --> 00:21:18.281
was really very similar.

536
00:21:18.281 --> 00:21:20.463
That's what I had done, I wasn't consciously

537
00:21:20.463 --> 00:21:23.119
going, oh I'm doing Laszlo's hierarchy of needs

538
00:21:23.119 --> 00:21:23.979
[Regina] But you were.

539
00:21:23.979 --> 00:21:25.199
<v ->But after the fact, looking back,</v>

540
00:21:25.199 --> 00:21:26.899
that's exactly what I had done.

541
00:21:26.899 --> 00:21:28.999
[Regina] Let's start getting into

542
00:21:28.999 --> 00:21:31.279
some of the practical points.

543
00:21:31.279 --> 00:21:35.959
Now let's say you're in debt, and at this point

544
00:21:35.959 --> 00:21:38.059
you may have even lost your job.

545
00:21:38.059 --> 00:21:40.319
Maybe you're on unemployment, or it's running out.

546
00:21:40.319 --> 00:21:41.399
Now, that's a pretty desperate,

547
00:21:41.399 --> 00:21:42.819
that's a desperate place to be

548
00:21:42.819 --> 00:21:45.089
in the worst case scenario, for all of us.

549
00:21:45.089 --> 00:21:45.909
<v ->Right.</v>

550
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:47.389
[Regina] There might be a time in all of our lives,

551
00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:48.929
when we've each been there.

552
00:21:48.929 --> 00:21:49.709
<v ->Right.</v>

553
00:21:49.709 --> 00:21:50.749
[Regina] When we don't have money

554
00:21:50.749 --> 00:21:51.999
to feed ourselves, you know.

555
00:21:51.999 --> 00:21:56.459
How would you start in that place?

556
00:21:56.459 --> 00:21:58.819
Because that's not a place of empowerment.

557
00:21:58.819 --> 00:22:03.819
<v ->No, that's a place of fear, oh my gosh, and shame.</v>

558
00:22:05.299 --> 00:22:07.459
How could I have gotten to this point.

559
00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:09.799
And so I think it's really important,

560
00:22:09.799 --> 00:22:11.479
and I know when i found myself there,

561
00:22:11.479 --> 00:22:15.079
I needed to first admit that I needed help.

562
00:22:15.079 --> 00:22:17.159
That I just couldn't go it alone.

563
00:22:17.159 --> 00:22:19.779
And, this is gonna look different for different people.

564
00:22:19.779 --> 00:22:22.079
Some people might seek a 12 step program,

565
00:22:22.079 --> 00:22:24.039
like debtors anonymous, which is a free program,

566
00:22:24.039 --> 00:22:26.919
based on the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous.

567
00:22:26.919 --> 00:22:29.839
Some people might find a good friend, somebody.

568
00:22:29.839 --> 00:22:32.059
They might find a pastor, a therapist,

569
00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:34.899
a financial recovery counselor, but someone

570
00:22:34.899 --> 00:22:37.579
where they can say, I don't know what I am going to do.

571
00:22:37.579 --> 00:22:39.679
So that their not in it alone.

572
00:22:39.679 --> 00:22:42.919
And I know when I was there, there were days that,

573
00:22:42.919 --> 00:22:44.839
it wasn't just one day at a time,

574
00:22:44.839 --> 00:22:46.399
it was one moment at a time.

575
00:22:46.399 --> 00:22:49.199
I would think, today I have a roof over my head,

576
00:22:49.199 --> 00:22:53.859
today I have money for food, and it was just,

577
00:22:53.859 --> 00:22:56.259
and also, trying to focus in on

578
00:22:56.259 --> 00:22:58.359
what I had that I could be grateful for.

579
00:22:58.359 --> 00:23:00.919
It's so easy to be, just feel,

580
00:23:00.919 --> 00:23:04.279
just this fear take over so that we completely

581
00:23:04.279 --> 00:23:06.719
lose perspective that we do have anything.

582
00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:08.899
Like, we have a beautiful place that we can

583
00:23:08.899 --> 00:23:11.159
go out, and perhaps do a little meditating,

584
00:23:11.159 --> 00:23:13.879
or that we have a friend that we can take a walk with.

585
00:23:13.879 --> 00:23:18.879
So, it's finding that place of having

586
00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:21.879
some kind of faith and hope, but also,

587
00:23:21.879 --> 00:23:23.659
we have to back that up with foot work.

588
00:23:23.659 --> 00:23:26.319
And so, no matter how desperate someone's situation is,

589
00:23:26.319 --> 00:23:28.999
I would say the first thing is asking for help,

590
00:23:28.999 --> 00:23:32.299
and saying I'm going to look at the true reality,

591
00:23:32.299 --> 00:23:34.899
the complete reality of my financial picture.

592
00:23:34.899 --> 00:23:36.719
I may not be able to do it in one sitting,

593
00:23:36.719 --> 00:23:39.699
but I'm going to know what the situation is.

594
00:23:39.699 --> 00:23:43.919
And, Regina, I have had so many clients come in,

595
00:23:43.919 --> 00:23:47.099
and the situation seemed impossible.

596
00:23:47.099 --> 00:23:50.179
I wouldn't even know, even if I had

597
00:23:50.179 --> 00:23:52.039
several years experience, I would go,

598
00:23:52.039 --> 00:23:54.399
I have no idea what the solution is going to be.

599
00:23:54.399 --> 00:23:58.439
However, just beginning to take action,

600
00:23:58.439 --> 00:24:01.059
and not, it doesn't have to be tons,

601
00:24:01.059 --> 00:24:04.019
it could be just knowing what the next step is.

602
00:24:04.019 --> 00:24:07.739
It's really hard to know how we're gonna get

603
00:24:07.739 --> 00:24:09.179
from here to where we wanna be.

604
00:24:09.179 --> 00:24:12.459
And so, if we just know what that next step is,

605
00:24:12.459 --> 00:24:14.599
I could say to people, because I had seen

606
00:24:14.599 --> 00:24:16.599
it happen for myself, I had experienced it,

607
00:24:16.599 --> 00:24:18.819
but I had seen it happen for a lot of people,

608
00:24:18.819 --> 00:24:23.079
is that solutions will appear that are better

609
00:24:23.079 --> 00:24:24.619
that we could have imagined.

610
00:24:24.619 --> 00:24:27.579
[Regina] When you talk about such example in your book,

611
00:24:27.579 --> 00:24:30.519
about a couple, it was two women.

612
00:24:30.519 --> 00:24:32.819
And, one of the women was severely in debt.

613
00:24:32.819 --> 00:24:34.979
It was her house, her partner was living

614
00:24:34.979 --> 00:24:37.599
at her house with her, and she was too ashamed

615
00:24:37.599 --> 00:24:40.459
to even tell her partner, I'm busted, I'm broke.

616
00:24:40.459 --> 00:24:44.479
I can't continue, and yet she met with you,

617
00:24:44.479 --> 00:24:47.799
and she finally told her partner,

618
00:24:47.799 --> 00:24:49.399
and her partner said, I've been feeling like it's

619
00:24:49.399 --> 00:24:51.939
not really right for me to be living in your house anyway.

620
00:24:51.939 --> 00:24:54.399
Why don't we be real partners, let me pitch in,

621
00:24:54.399 --> 00:24:55.999
and pay into your house.

622
00:24:55.999 --> 00:24:58.719
And she was able to pay her debts.

623
00:24:58.719 --> 00:25:00.359
And then you must have helped her,

624
00:25:00.359 --> 00:25:02.879
at that point, start looking at, how did you get there?

625
00:25:02.879 --> 00:25:04.279
<v ->Exactly, because she didn't want</v>

626
00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:06.179
to go back in that same place.

627
00:25:06.179 --> 00:25:08.938
And the things is, here she was hiding out from her partner.

628
00:25:08.938 --> 00:25:12.699
The person that she loved, was sharing her life with,

629
00:25:12.699 --> 00:25:15.239
and keeping it a secret from her.

630
00:25:15.239 --> 00:25:19.599
And so she was also feeling, not an intergrity

631
00:25:19.599 --> 00:25:21.298
in her relationship.

632
00:25:21.298 --> 00:25:23.359
So, it was bothering her on two levels.

633
00:25:23.359 --> 00:25:25.619
And, one of the things we had talked about

634
00:25:25.619 --> 00:25:28.079
was what her fear was.

635
00:25:28.079 --> 00:25:30.439
And her fear was that she would be rejected by her partner.

636
00:25:30.439 --> 00:25:32.239
And it was just the opposite.

637
00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:33.439
And that's the thing, if we don't

638
00:25:33.439 --> 00:25:35.019
tell the people we love the truth,

639
00:25:35.019 --> 00:25:37.159
we will never be able to take in

640
00:25:37.159 --> 00:25:39.179
the love and support they offer us,

641
00:25:39.179 --> 00:25:40.999
because we will think, oh yes,

642
00:25:40.999 --> 00:25:43.479
but if they only knew the reality

643
00:25:43.479 --> 00:25:44.339
of the situation--

644
00:25:44.339 --> 00:25:45.179
[Regina] There's some corruption there.

645
00:25:45.179 --> 00:25:48.459
<v ->There is, and so she got to experience</v>

646
00:25:48.459 --> 00:25:51.639
this acceptance and this love, and this solution.

647
00:25:51.639 --> 00:25:54.099
And it made the relationship stronger,

648
00:25:54.099 --> 00:25:56.899
and you also identify the important,

649
00:25:56.899 --> 00:25:59.639
the very important point, was that she knew

650
00:25:59.639 --> 00:26:02.039
unless she changed her behavior,

651
00:26:02.039 --> 00:26:03.779
she could end up back there again.

652
00:26:03.779 --> 00:26:04.599
[Regina] Yes.

653
00:26:04.599 --> 00:26:05.839
<v ->And that's what people have to watch</v>

654
00:26:05.839 --> 00:26:08.459
when they get a quick fix.

655
00:26:08.459 --> 00:26:10.619
Or if there is an infusion of money

656
00:26:10.619 --> 00:26:12.019
and makes things better for a while,

657
00:26:12.019 --> 00:26:14.139
or if people file bankruptcy, and now

658
00:26:14.139 --> 00:26:16.279
they have been relieved of their debt.

659
00:26:16.279 --> 00:26:18.779
It's so easy, people get out of debt all the time.

660
00:26:18.779 --> 00:26:21.070
We want something that's sustainable for people.

661
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.070
So that they don't go back into

662
00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.740
the same situation over and over.

663
00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.199
[Regina] Because that's what usually happens.

664
00:26:26.199 --> 00:26:28.399
People's relationship with money is what it is,

665
00:26:28.399 --> 00:26:30.779
good, bad, or indifferent, until you do something.

666
00:26:30.779 --> 00:26:33.219
<v ->Until you say, I'm really gonna confront this,</v>

667
00:26:33.219 --> 00:26:34.559
and stay commited.

668
00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:37.598
[Regina] We were talking a moment ago, about a person,

669
00:26:37.598 --> 00:26:39.938
one of the many, many, many millions of people,

670
00:26:39.938 --> 00:26:41.738
in desperate straits.

671
00:26:41.738 --> 00:26:46.719
And having to, A, know that you are not alone, seek help.

672
00:26:46.719 --> 00:26:50.059
Be able to start looking at how did I get here,

673
00:26:50.059 --> 00:26:51.198
what are my beliefs.

674
00:26:51.198 --> 00:26:53.579
And what I love about your book is you take people

675
00:26:53.579 --> 00:26:56.318
through all of these steps, and they have to very,

676
00:26:56.318 --> 00:26:59.919
if they wanna participate and use this as their study guide,

677
00:26:59.919 --> 00:27:03.618
what an inexpensive, efficient way to look at your finances.

678
00:27:03.618 --> 00:27:04.759
<v ->Thank you.</v>

679
00:27:04.759 --> 00:27:06.759
[Regina] You go through and you have to look at

680
00:27:06.759 --> 00:27:10.859
how am I behaving, why am I feeling the way I do

681
00:27:10.859 --> 00:27:12.479
about one thing after another.

682
00:27:12.479 --> 00:27:14.519
It really requires evaluation.

683
00:27:14.519 --> 00:27:17.379
And from that point, as you say, even a person,

684
00:27:17.379 --> 00:27:19.179
like yourself, whose an expert in this area

685
00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:21.139
can't tell them how to dig out all the time.

686
00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:23.699
But, they'll start recognizing

687
00:27:23.699 --> 00:27:26.759
assets in their lives, solutions, right?

688
00:27:26.759 --> 00:27:28.659
Finding beauty and joy again.

689
00:27:28.659 --> 00:27:30.138
That's really part of it, isn't it?

690
00:27:30.138 --> 00:27:31.479
<v ->Absolutely, yes.</v>

691
00:27:31.479 --> 00:27:33.039
And another thing I wanna say,

692
00:27:33.039 --> 00:27:34.819
when you were mentioning earlier,

693
00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:38.119
earlier in our interview, about plastic and how

694
00:27:38.119 --> 00:27:39.958
disconnected we are from our money.

695
00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:42.259
You, know casinos have known this for years.

696
00:27:42.259 --> 00:27:46.719
They change people's cash into chips, so it's not real.

697
00:27:46.719 --> 00:27:49.279
So another things that's important for people as they

698
00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:53.719
embrace this as a process, is that they need to know.

699
00:27:53.719 --> 00:27:55.898
Because plastic isn't going to disappear.

700
00:27:55.898 --> 00:27:59.159
I mean, it's just not, you know what I mean?

701
00:27:59.159 --> 00:28:01.139
And maybe something will replace it,

702
00:28:01.139 --> 00:28:03.919
but the plastic or whatever will replace it,

703
00:28:03.919 --> 00:28:07.058
is basically designed to keep us

704
00:28:07.058 --> 00:28:10.598
disconnected from our money.

705
00:28:10.598 --> 00:28:15.054
And so, it has to be a very conscious decision, that I am

706
00:28:15.054 --> 00:28:19.614
going to, regardless of how our financial system works,

707
00:28:19.614 --> 00:28:22.725
I'm gonna be mindful of my money.

708
00:28:22.725 --> 00:28:24.624
I'm going to be a steward of my money.

709
00:28:24.624 --> 00:28:27.285
I wanna get my arms around it so that I understand

710
00:28:27.285 --> 00:28:29.945
not only the dollars and cents so I can get smart

711
00:28:29.945 --> 00:28:31.585
about money and how to handle it.

712
00:28:31.585 --> 00:28:35.264
But I also wanna know about advertising,

713
00:28:35.264 --> 00:28:36.465
and how it affects me.

714
00:28:36.465 --> 00:28:39.025
I wanna understand the lost opportunities

715
00:28:39.025 --> 00:28:41.065
if I'm carrying credit card debt,

716
00:28:41.065 --> 00:28:43.145
and sending all that money to,

717
00:28:43.145 --> 00:28:47.405
to financial institutions and helping them get rich.

718
00:28:47.405 --> 00:28:51.365
So that people really educate themselves about money

719
00:28:51.365 --> 00:28:54.785
and how difficult it is to stay connected.

720
00:28:54.785 --> 00:28:58.084
Because believe me, if we're not connected,

721
00:28:58.084 --> 00:28:59.945
we're going to spend more money.

722
00:28:59.945 --> 00:29:02.184
Statistics show, if people use plastic,

723
00:29:02.184 --> 00:29:05.105
even if they pay their credit cards off every month,

724
00:29:05.105 --> 00:29:06.885
even if their using debit cards,

725
00:29:06.885 --> 00:29:10.425
people will spend 23 to 30% more.

726
00:29:10.425 --> 00:29:12.525
[Regina] Than if they had cash in their wallet.

727
00:29:12.525 --> 00:29:13.845
<v ->Than if they're paying cash or</v>

728
00:29:13.845 --> 00:29:15.585
if they're keeping a register so they see--

729
00:29:15.585 --> 00:29:16.345
[Regina] Writing checks.

730
00:29:16.345 --> 00:29:18.095
Keeping their checkbook, even if they're

731
00:29:18.095 --> 00:29:19.465
using their debit card and they go home and they are

732
00:29:19.465 --> 00:29:22.204
tracking it, this is the amount of money I spent today.

733
00:29:22.204 --> 00:29:24.144
They're mindful, they're conscious.

734
00:29:24.144 --> 00:29:29.105
So, I've had people say, if I had to write it down,

735
00:29:29.105 --> 00:29:31.344
I decided not to spend it.

736
00:29:31.344 --> 00:29:32.605
[Regina] Yes.

737
00:29:32.605 --> 00:29:35.965
<v ->And so just, because there's a lot of mindless spending.</v>

738
00:29:35.965 --> 00:29:38.505
[Regina] We're encouraged to spend mindlessly.

739
00:29:38.505 --> 00:29:41.865
Our entire society is wired to have us spend mindlessly.

740
00:29:41.865 --> 00:29:45.145
<v ->So, we wanna be mindful, and then once we know</v>

741
00:29:45.145 --> 00:29:46.945
how we're spending our money, we can discern,

742
00:29:46.945 --> 00:29:48.045
how do we feel about that.

743
00:29:48.045 --> 00:29:50.205
Is this something that I feel good about?

744
00:29:50.205 --> 00:29:53.265
Is this adding to the lifestyle that I wanna have?

745
00:29:53.265 --> 00:29:56.214
Is this supporting my value system?

746
00:29:56.214 --> 00:30:00.554
Or am I unconsciously frittering money away,

747
00:30:00.554 --> 00:30:03.654
in areas that, actually, I don't feel that good about?

748
00:30:03.654 --> 00:30:06.354
And so, that's kinda the start.

749
00:30:06.354 --> 00:30:11.154
And so, if we track, tracking is one of the

750
00:30:11.154 --> 00:30:12.193
number one things to do.

751
00:30:12.193 --> 00:30:14.634
Is, I am going to get very conscious of

752
00:30:14.634 --> 00:30:17.094
and connected to, my money by tracking everything I spend.

753
00:30:17.094 --> 00:30:22.054
Now, what we have is, okay, I'm connected to the act,

754
00:30:22.054 --> 00:30:26.914
and so I can make a decision of this is a good thing or not.

755
00:30:26.914 --> 00:30:31.234
And then we end up with data, and we can say, okay,

756
00:30:31.234 --> 00:30:33.434
and this is another really important thing,

757
00:30:33.434 --> 00:30:34.954
people think of it as a budget,

758
00:30:34.954 --> 00:30:37.034
I call it a spending plan, because budgets

759
00:30:37.034 --> 00:30:38.773
can have a negative connotation,

760
00:30:38.773 --> 00:30:42.254
like diets, where there are no goodies,

761
00:30:42.254 --> 00:30:45.274
and now instead of rear-view mirror accounting,

762
00:30:45.274 --> 00:30:47.953
maybe looking at it every few months,

763
00:30:47.953 --> 00:30:50.814
or maybe even once a year, just at tax time.

764
00:30:50.814 --> 00:30:53.894
If we can say, I'm gonna plan,

765
00:30:53.894 --> 00:30:56.374
it's like planning a trip and knowing where you're going.

766
00:30:56.374 --> 00:30:59.374
How do I want to end up, how do I wanna end this month?

767
00:30:59.374 --> 00:31:01.074
What are the things that are important to me?

768
00:31:01.074 --> 00:31:03.494
So, we make plan going into the month,

769
00:31:03.494 --> 00:31:05.074
and we track against that.

770
00:31:05.074 --> 00:31:07.974
And, if we wanna get to know ourselves,

771
00:31:07.974 --> 00:31:11.214
we then wanna look at it and say,

772
00:31:11.214 --> 00:31:15.494
if I deviated from my plan, what was the reason?

773
00:31:15.494 --> 00:31:17.373
And there's usually one of three reasons.

774
00:31:17.373 --> 00:31:20.754
One, didn't plan enough, or planned too much,

775
00:31:20.754 --> 00:31:22.514
because I don't really know yet.

776
00:31:22.514 --> 00:31:26.554
Two, something came up that I could not have anticipated.

777
00:31:26.554 --> 00:31:30.074
For example, they blew a tire, somebody died

778
00:31:30.074 --> 00:31:32.714
and they had to buy an airplane ticket and fly some place.

779
00:31:32.714 --> 00:31:35.114
They didn't know that going into the month to plan.

780
00:31:35.114 --> 00:31:38.594
Then the third one is, I saw it, I wanted it, I bought it.

781
00:31:38.594 --> 00:31:39.594
[Regina] Now.

782
00:31:39.594 --> 00:31:41.674
<v ->Now, and we usually will rationalize</v>

783
00:31:41.674 --> 00:31:44.314
and justify that behavior.

784
00:31:44.314 --> 00:31:45.574
[Regina] Oh, I've done that.

785
00:31:45.574 --> 00:31:46.354
<v ->I have too.</v>

786
00:31:46.354 --> 00:31:48.474
We're all great at doing that.

787
00:31:48.474 --> 00:31:51.094
And the thing is, is that, if we

788
00:31:51.094 --> 00:31:53.474
ask ourselves those three questions,

789
00:31:53.474 --> 00:31:55.234
if we're that connected to our money,

790
00:31:55.234 --> 00:31:59.734
we're asking ourselves, what are my motivations, and, if I'm

791
00:31:59.734 --> 00:32:02.014
not spending in the way I want, which one of these three?

792
00:32:02.014 --> 00:32:05.614
Now, we're really getting, we're changing things.

793
00:32:05.614 --> 00:32:08.974
We're going to change, and recognize

794
00:32:08.974 --> 00:32:11.074
the sabotage that we're doing.

795
00:32:11.074 --> 00:32:13.834
[Regina] Um-hm. That would be quite

796
00:32:13.834 --> 00:32:17.234
a taking account in our life.

797
00:32:17.234 --> 00:32:19.093
<v ->That's it, it's the taking account.</v>

798
00:32:19.093 --> 00:32:20.734
[Regina] To see that in general.

799
00:32:20.734 --> 00:32:22.874
Where our psyche is, where our emotions are.

800
00:32:22.874 --> 00:32:25.554
And what's interesting, you know,

801
00:32:25.554 --> 00:32:26.954
when you're talking about that.

802
00:32:26.954 --> 00:32:28.491
If a person needs to take stock and track their expenses,

803
00:32:28.491 --> 00:32:32.374
as you say, do this planning,

804
00:32:32.374 --> 00:32:36.494
a lot of people would have resistance to this,

805
00:32:36.494 --> 00:32:39.434
right off the bat, thinking, I don't have

806
00:32:39.434 --> 00:32:41.174
that much to spend as it is.

807
00:32:41.174 --> 00:32:43.594
I do not want to put that kind of a limit on myself.

808
00:32:43.594 --> 00:32:46.634
And yet, you have situations where, if a person

809
00:32:46.634 --> 00:32:49.174
feels like that, coming from a place of deprivation,

810
00:32:49.174 --> 00:32:53.314
for example, you end up spending all these little increments

811
00:32:53.314 --> 00:32:54.814
on things that aren't necessary,

812
00:32:54.814 --> 00:32:56.654
and then when you have to have something that's necessary,

813
00:32:56.654 --> 00:32:57.601
there's no money there.

814
00:32:57.601 --> 00:32:58.341
<v ->Right.</v>

815
00:32:58.341 --> 00:32:59.681
[Regina] Like dental work, for example.

816
00:32:59.681 --> 00:33:01.101
<v ->That's the great sabotage.</v>

817
00:33:01.101 --> 00:33:04.541
The other reason that people resist looking at things,

818
00:33:04.541 --> 00:33:07.081
yes they have this fear that, oh some, you know,

819
00:33:07.081 --> 00:33:08.541
I'm gonna set limits for myself?

820
00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:09.381
[Regina] I'll have have no pleasure in life.

821
00:33:09.381 --> 00:33:10.951
<v ->Oh, I'll have no pleasure in life.</v>

822
00:33:10.951 --> 00:33:13.263
And the reality is, it's the opposite.

823
00:33:13.263 --> 00:33:17.223
However, the other resistance that people have is,

824
00:33:17.223 --> 00:33:20.563
they may see something that they have to change.

825
00:33:20.563 --> 00:33:23.183
So, let's say someone is not nourishing

826
00:33:23.183 --> 00:33:24.503
themselves very well.

827
00:33:24.503 --> 00:33:26.783
They're eating a lot of fast food, spending money on it.

828
00:33:26.783 --> 00:33:28.223
They're eating out all the time.

829
00:33:28.223 --> 00:33:32.342
And they know that they're spending way more money

830
00:33:32.342 --> 00:33:35.403
than is appropriate for the money that they have.

831
00:33:35.403 --> 00:33:37.823
So if they look at it, then they're going to have to

832
00:33:37.823 --> 00:33:41.023
make a decision because they're meeting some need,

833
00:33:41.023 --> 00:33:42.843
there's some payoff for them in doing that.

834
00:33:42.843 --> 00:33:47.843
It maybe social, it may have other contributors.

835
00:33:48.403 --> 00:33:53.323
And so, again, ah then I'm not just looking at the money.

836
00:33:53.323 --> 00:33:55.163
What am I gonna do about my social life.

837
00:33:55.163 --> 00:33:58.263
You know, this is how I spend time with my friends.

838
00:33:58.263 --> 00:34:01.323
And so, again we have to take it to several levels,

839
00:34:01.323 --> 00:34:03.342
and the numbers will tell the stories

840
00:34:03.342 --> 00:34:04.983
that we want to start exploring.

841
00:34:04.983 --> 00:34:07.342
And seeing how we can have a different way

842
00:34:07.342 --> 00:34:10.663
of meeting our social needs and meeting those

843
00:34:10.663 --> 00:34:13.403
needs that are important to us.

844
00:34:13.413 --> 00:34:14.838
But in ways that cost less or no money.

845
00:34:14.838 --> 00:34:16.419
We wanna look at how we spend our time,

846
00:34:16.419 --> 00:34:17.618
our energy and our money.

847
00:34:17.618 --> 00:34:20.318
Those are all resources that are going to either

848
00:34:20.318 --> 00:34:23.579
leave us feeling depleted or, hopefully,

849
00:34:23.579 --> 00:34:26.238
feeling fulfilled and that life is worth living.

850
00:34:26.238 --> 00:34:30.101
[Regina] Yes, and when you're just spending needlessly,

851
00:34:30.101 --> 00:34:32.941
or unconsciously might be a better word,

852
00:34:32.941 --> 00:34:35.381
often, because there's always this feeling

853
00:34:35.381 --> 00:34:37.441
against a person's back, I shouldn't be doing this.

854
00:34:37.441 --> 00:34:41.041
I shouldn't be doing this, I'm running up a little debt,

855
00:34:41.041 --> 00:34:45.041
or what not, that puts a person into a position

856
00:34:45.041 --> 00:34:49.781
of settling or making due, with a quality of experience

857
00:34:49.781 --> 00:34:54.061
or stuff or whatever that is not really what you want.

858
00:34:54.061 --> 00:34:56.261
But you can afford it now, it's on sale.

859
00:34:56.261 --> 00:34:59.421
Whether it's a two for one meal at a crumby place

860
00:34:59.421 --> 00:35:02.621
that you wouldn't normally eat at, or whatever it is.

861
00:35:02.621 --> 00:35:05.181
Let's talk about how we compromise our self

862
00:35:05.181 --> 00:35:08.421
when we're not willing to look at our finances

863
00:35:08.421 --> 00:35:10.601
and we're not budgeting for what we really love.

864
00:35:10.601 --> 00:35:12.902
And spending beyond our needs just the same.

865
00:35:12.902 --> 00:35:16.597
<v ->I think about it, Regina, as doing without,</v>

866
00:35:16.597 --> 00:35:19.357
making due, or overdoing.

867
00:35:19.357 --> 00:35:21.977
And these are all behaviors that we wanna look at.

868
00:35:21.977 --> 00:35:24.417
So, if we think about doing without.

869
00:35:24.417 --> 00:35:26.397
Once we become conscious we may realize

870
00:35:26.397 --> 00:35:28.517
we're doing without things that rare really important to us,

871
00:35:28.517 --> 00:35:30.377
but we're spending this money over here.

872
00:35:30.377 --> 00:35:32.357
And we're spending it, perhaps, on other people.

873
00:35:32.357 --> 00:35:33.997
Then there's the making due.

874
00:35:33.997 --> 00:35:35.517
And, I don't wanna confuse people.

875
00:35:35.517 --> 00:35:36.857
Frugality is a good thing.

876
00:35:36.857 --> 00:35:39.317
People of that as a negative word, kinda being cheap.

877
00:35:39.317 --> 00:35:42.197
But I'm talking about careful spending.

878
00:35:42.197 --> 00:35:44.777
However, if people are making due, for example,

879
00:35:44.777 --> 00:35:47.477
let's say they do love food, and love going out,

880
00:35:47.477 --> 00:35:50.517
but they're doing, you know, these cheap restaurants

881
00:35:50.517 --> 00:35:52.117
because they have a coupon.

882
00:35:52.117 --> 00:35:54.117
They might decide, that's making due,

883
00:35:54.117 --> 00:35:55.717
I'd rather eat out less often,

884
00:35:55.717 --> 00:35:58.177
and have it be a really nice experience.

885
00:35:58.177 --> 00:35:59.017
[Regina] Yes.

886
00:35:59.017 --> 00:36:00.817
<v ->And there are ways that people make due</v>

887
00:36:00.817 --> 00:36:04.297
that are not a part of being careful, but it's settling for.

888
00:36:04.297 --> 00:36:06.957
You know, yes the outfit isn't quite right,

889
00:36:06.957 --> 00:36:08.297
but it's on sale.

890
00:36:08.297 --> 00:36:11.217
By the way, sales are such a tricky thing.

891
00:36:11.217 --> 00:36:14.077
It's a set up for people to make due

892
00:36:14.077 --> 00:36:16.017
and not feel satisfied, and buy things

893
00:36:16.017 --> 00:36:18.875
that they will never use, or they don't feel good about it.

894
00:36:18.875 --> 00:36:23.035
Also, sales can be a way of attracting people

895
00:36:23.035 --> 00:36:25.355
to something that they weren't planning on spending.

896
00:36:25.355 --> 00:36:28.995
And so I tell people, it's not a good deal, if it's on sale,

897
00:36:28.995 --> 00:36:31.515
unless you were planning on buying it anyway.

898
00:36:31.515 --> 00:36:32.755
[Regina] Yes, very true.

899
00:36:32.755 --> 00:36:35.455
<v ->So people can get really trapped in the whole sale thing.</v>

900
00:36:35.455 --> 00:36:37.015
[Regina] You don't just head out on a Saturday morning

901
00:36:37.015 --> 00:36:39.715
with your charge card because Macy's has just sent you

902
00:36:39.715 --> 00:36:41.873
their flyer about the weekend sale.

903
00:36:41.873 --> 00:36:43.213
That's dangerous, you're saying?

904
00:36:43.213 --> 00:36:43.873
<v ->That's dangerous.</v>

905
00:36:43.873 --> 00:36:45.292
When people just go into stores

906
00:36:45.292 --> 00:36:47.493
looking for things to buy, that's dangerous.

907
00:36:47.493 --> 00:36:50.032
If you go armed with your list, and your plan

908
00:36:50.032 --> 00:36:51.853
and knowing what your needs are,

909
00:36:51.853 --> 00:36:54.832
you can completely turn what can turn out to be

910
00:36:54.832 --> 00:36:57.093
a negative experience where people will feel

911
00:36:57.093 --> 00:37:00.313
really hung over and remoseful afterwards,

912
00:37:00.313 --> 00:37:03.013
to feeling, oh, I did a good job yesterday.

913
00:37:03.013 --> 00:37:06.053
And, then the overdoing is, you know,

914
00:37:06.053 --> 00:37:07.313
that can be the overspending.

915
00:37:07.313 --> 00:37:09.113
But it can also be the overdoing,

916
00:37:09.113 --> 00:37:11.213
the overspending our time, our energy, our money.

917
00:37:11.213 --> 00:37:14.152
And again, it's just this frenetic way

918
00:37:14.152 --> 00:37:17.252
that we spend all of our resources.

919
00:37:17.252 --> 00:37:19.993
All three of those states, doing without,

920
00:37:19.993 --> 00:37:22.512
making due, and overdoing, leave us

921
00:37:22.512 --> 00:37:24.372
in a state of deprivation, and that

922
00:37:24.372 --> 00:37:26.532
just starts the cycle over and over again.

923
00:37:26.532 --> 00:37:28.993
So, again, when we plan our spending

924
00:37:28.993 --> 00:37:32.053
we wanna be looking at those categories of our life.

925
00:37:32.053 --> 00:37:33.893
Those categories in our spending plan.

926
00:37:33.893 --> 00:37:36.613
And, we wanna ask ourselves, am I doing without?

927
00:37:36.613 --> 00:37:39.233
Am I making due, or am I overdoing?

928
00:37:39.233 --> 00:37:41.573
And we wanna have that balance.

929
00:37:41.573 --> 00:37:45.153
This is where, if we recognize,

930
00:37:45.153 --> 00:37:47.313
for example, that we're overdoing.

931
00:37:47.313 --> 00:37:49.273
This is just another way that people can

932
00:37:49.273 --> 00:37:50.973
distract themselves from their life.

933
00:37:50.973 --> 00:37:54.593
So we can create time deprivation.

934
00:37:54.593 --> 00:37:56.873
We can create the money deprivation.

935
00:37:56.873 --> 00:38:01.113
And all of it is a way of keeping us distracted

936
00:38:01.113 --> 00:38:03.793
from what's really important and what we value.

937
00:38:03.793 --> 00:38:06.333
[Regina] Um-hmm, and classically speaking,

938
00:38:06.333 --> 00:38:09.273
this is something that we often assign to women.

939
00:38:09.273 --> 00:38:11.253
Women are the ones that are going to

940
00:38:11.253 --> 00:38:14.373
go charging, no pun intended, into the world

941
00:38:14.373 --> 00:38:17.173
on a weekend toward a sale.

942
00:38:17.173 --> 00:38:19.673
But, can you talk a little bit about,

943
00:38:19.673 --> 00:38:22.612
is there really a difference between genders?

944
00:38:22.612 --> 00:38:24.573
Or is it just what we spend our money on?

945
00:38:24.573 --> 00:38:28.833
<v ->Well, women seek help more often than men.</v>

946
00:38:28.833 --> 00:38:32.033
And so, I certainly saw more women in my business.

947
00:38:32.033 --> 00:38:35.253
However, men have their things as well.

948
00:38:35.253 --> 00:38:38.433
And, gosh, a study a few years ago showed that

949
00:38:38.433 --> 00:38:40.833
the number one thing that got men into trouble

950
00:38:40.833 --> 00:38:44.533
with money was cars, and for women it was relationships.

951
00:38:44.533 --> 00:38:46.573
The codependency.

952
00:38:46.573 --> 00:38:49.453
And, now, what I've seen over the years,

953
00:38:49.453 --> 00:38:53.013
is with electronics, and big TVs and toys.

954
00:38:53.013 --> 00:38:57.173
And so, in addition to cars, men may have different things.

955
00:38:57.173 --> 00:39:00.253
We may have our spa treatments, and our clothes

956
00:39:00.253 --> 00:39:02.793
and our manicures and pedicures that we spend money on,

957
00:39:02.793 --> 00:39:04.973
and our self help stuff.

958
00:39:04.973 --> 00:39:09.053
And men may have it be the things they enjoy.

959
00:39:09.053 --> 00:39:09.773
[Regina] Technology.

960
00:39:09.773 --> 00:39:12.633
<v ->And sports, going to the sports bar with their buddies.</v>

961
00:39:12.633 --> 00:39:15.413
And so again, if they find they're dropping

962
00:39:15.413 --> 00:39:17.293
several hundred dollars a month doing that,

963
00:39:17.293 --> 00:39:19.573
and they really can't afford to do that,

964
00:39:19.573 --> 00:39:23.053
then they like watching sports and being with their buddies,

965
00:39:23.053 --> 00:39:25.053
it's just finding another way to do it

966
00:39:25.053 --> 00:39:26.993
so they're not dropping all that money doing it.

967
00:39:26.993 --> 00:39:30.553
So, men suffer from this as much as women do.

968
00:39:30.553 --> 00:39:33.793
It's just that they don't speak about it as often,

969
00:39:33.793 --> 00:39:35.653
and they don't seek help as often as women.

970
00:39:35.653 --> 00:39:37.653
[Regina] Is there a different relationship though,

971
00:39:37.653 --> 00:39:39.393
to money, between men and women,

972
00:39:39.393 --> 00:39:41.813
in that, if you want to look at it as

973
00:39:41.813 --> 00:39:44.073
traits that are genetically passed down.

974
00:39:44.073 --> 00:39:46.013
Women haven't really been in the workforce that long.

975
00:39:46.013 --> 00:39:48.213
And none of us have had credit cards for that long.

976
00:39:48.213 --> 00:39:53.213
Men, it seems, my observation has been,

977
00:39:53.873 --> 00:39:58.292
it's very common for men to,say, declared bankruptcy.

978
00:39:58.292 --> 00:40:00.804
Much more common than all the women I've known.

979
00:40:00.804 --> 00:40:03.324
It was just like women would do almost anything,

980
00:40:03.324 --> 00:40:05.164
they'd practically sell themselves

981
00:40:05.164 --> 00:40:07.224
to stay away from bankruptcy.

982
00:40:07.224 --> 00:40:10.024
Where for a man it's another decision to be made.

983
00:40:10.024 --> 00:40:12.384
And it's like, oh I'd go make it again.

984
00:40:12.384 --> 00:40:14.644
<v ->Yes, men and women are different.</v>

985
00:40:14.644 --> 00:40:16.705
They say women are from Venus

986
00:40:16.705 --> 00:40:18.164
and men are from Mars.

987
00:40:18.164 --> 00:40:20.104
So, we do make decisions different.

988
00:40:20.104 --> 00:40:23.044
And that may, also men tend to have

989
00:40:23.044 --> 00:40:25.504
a higher risk tolerance for investing

990
00:40:25.504 --> 00:40:28.264
and taking risks in business than women do.

991
00:40:28.264 --> 00:40:30.744
And so, yes I definitely did see those differences.

992
00:40:30.744 --> 00:40:33.824
However, the process of financial reovery

993
00:40:33.824 --> 00:40:35.584
was the same for both.

994
00:40:35.584 --> 00:40:36.624
[Regina] It's the same fundamental truths.

995
00:40:36.624 --> 00:40:39.104
<v ->It's the same fundamental truths.</v>

996
00:40:39.104 --> 00:40:42.364
And the same fundamental process, to help people

997
00:40:42.364 --> 00:40:44.904
get to that place where they're living a life,

998
00:40:44.904 --> 00:40:49.684
a values based lifestyle, that is based on the vision,

999
00:40:49.684 --> 00:40:51.867
that hopefully people can create for themselves

1000
00:40:51.867 --> 00:40:53.367
when they're out of survival.

1001
00:40:53.367 --> 00:40:56.507
[Regina] So we talked about, a little bit ago,

1002
00:40:56.507 --> 00:40:58.247
just on a really practical level,

1003
00:40:58.247 --> 00:41:01.987
the need to get in touch with the truth of your situation.

1004
00:41:01.987 --> 00:41:04.947
And then you talked about making a financial plan

1005
00:41:04.947 --> 00:41:07.647
that accommodates the things that you love.

1006
00:41:07.647 --> 00:41:09.627
If you're a movie goer, you don't just say,

1007
00:41:09.627 --> 00:41:11.667
no, we have to pay off the credit cards,

1008
00:41:11.667 --> 00:41:13.387
no more movies for you.

1009
00:41:13.387 --> 00:41:14.627
That's self sabotage, in another way.

1010
00:41:14.627 --> 00:41:16.426
<v ->Black and white thinking doesn't work.</v>

1011
00:41:16.426 --> 00:41:18.047
All or nothing doesn't work.

1012
00:41:18.047 --> 00:41:20.966
And, I have five grandchildren,

1013
00:41:20.966 --> 00:41:23.826
and I love taking my grandchildren shopping.

1014
00:41:23.826 --> 00:41:27.887
And one of the things that my grandson told my daughter.

1015
00:41:27.887 --> 00:41:30.287
She called me once when they were shopping for shoes,

1016
00:41:30.287 --> 00:41:32.387
and she said, mom, I could shoot you.

1017
00:41:32.387 --> 00:41:34.387
I'm trying to get Nicholas to buy these

1018
00:41:34.387 --> 00:41:36.486
inexpensive shoes and he says,

1019
00:41:36.486 --> 00:41:38.647
Grandma says you only buy what you love.

1020
00:41:38.647 --> 00:41:40.187
(laughter)

1021
00:41:40.187 --> 00:41:43.487
And so, I have taught the kids to,

1022
00:41:43.487 --> 00:41:45.987
rather than just a lot of stuff,

1023
00:41:45.987 --> 00:41:49.527
buy things that you love and that you're going to use.

1024
00:41:49.527 --> 00:41:51.627
And, if it's clothes, buy clothes that you love

1025
00:41:51.627 --> 00:41:53.327
and that you're going to wear.

1026
00:41:53.327 --> 00:41:55.587
Because that's how we get to the point of enough.

1027
00:41:55.587 --> 00:41:58.287
And, by the way, we wanna start teaching our children

1028
00:41:58.287 --> 00:42:00.906
these lessons, modeling it for them.

1029
00:42:00.906 --> 00:42:03.847
Helping kids learn to delay gratification

1030
00:42:03.847 --> 00:42:06.507
by giving them some experiences

1031
00:42:06.507 --> 00:42:09.247
of evaluating how important this is.

1032
00:42:09.247 --> 00:42:10.546
You know, buying a little time

1033
00:42:10.546 --> 00:42:12.667
so that they can think it through.

1034
00:42:12.667 --> 00:42:14.587
And have to sleep on it for a few days,

1035
00:42:14.587 --> 00:42:16.746
rather than just giving in impulsively

1036
00:42:16.746 --> 00:42:19.047
to the kids and the things they want.

1037
00:42:19.047 --> 00:42:21.287
[Regina] Lets talk about the reflection.

1038
00:42:21.287 --> 00:42:24.647
Not of a person whose having a really difficult time,

1039
00:42:24.647 --> 00:42:26.567
but of someone, you even mention

1040
00:42:26.567 --> 00:42:28.026
Michael Jackson, in your book.

1041
00:42:28.026 --> 00:42:29.927
But someone whose doing really really well,

1042
00:42:29.927 --> 00:42:32.327
but has a, still ends up in the same place.

1043
00:42:32.327 --> 00:42:34.907
He was in horrible debt and the time of his birth.

1044
00:42:34.907 --> 00:42:36.866
I mean at the time of his death, excuse me.

1045
00:42:36.866 --> 00:42:37.506
<v ->At the time of his death.</v>

1046
00:42:37.506 --> 00:42:38.906
Well, you know I wondered if they would

1047
00:42:38.906 --> 00:42:40.507
let me put the story in the book,

1048
00:42:40.507 --> 00:42:42.487
because as I was watching the story unfold,

1049
00:42:42.487 --> 00:42:45.447
when Michael Jackson died, I was

1050
00:42:45.447 --> 00:42:47.847
thinking of what I have in the book

1051
00:42:47.847 --> 00:42:49.267
called the Money Life Drain.

1052
00:42:49.267 --> 00:42:52.767
And it talks about, here we know that Michael Jackson

1053
00:42:52.767 --> 00:42:56.487
had made millions and millions of dollars.

1054
00:42:56.487 --> 00:42:59.447
But we also knew that he was millions of dollars in debt.

1055
00:42:59.447 --> 00:43:02.187
And on the verge of losing Neverland.

1056
00:43:02.187 --> 00:43:05.247
And he was definitely a compulsive spender.

1057
00:43:05.247 --> 00:43:06.467
They talked about the fact,

1058
00:43:06.467 --> 00:43:11.407
let's just remove the whole idea of drugs, okay.

1059
00:43:11.407 --> 00:43:14.507
He had behaviors with money for a long time

1060
00:43:14.507 --> 00:43:16.007
that had been in the news,

1061
00:43:16.007 --> 00:43:18.147
and people talked about his compulsive shopping,

1062
00:43:18.147 --> 00:43:19.667
and all of his debt.

1063
00:43:19.667 --> 00:43:22.407
And how much money it took him to run his life.

1064
00:43:22.407 --> 00:43:27.407
And, so, when he died, I recognized the same things

1065
00:43:28.167 --> 00:43:30.766
that I talk about in the Money Life Drain.

1066
00:43:30.766 --> 00:43:33.167
Where you have financial burdens,

1067
00:43:33.167 --> 00:43:35.667
overspending, worrying about debt.

1068
00:43:35.667 --> 00:43:39.287
And then the next level is you need,

1069
00:43:39.287 --> 00:43:42.767
you have pressure to work and earn more money.

1070
00:43:42.767 --> 00:43:46.386
And you just keep going down hill,

1071
00:43:46.386 --> 00:43:47.766
and eventually, you end up with

1072
00:43:47.766 --> 00:43:49.747
emotional, financial, and spiritual depletion.

1073
00:43:49.747 --> 00:43:51.738
Well, I thought, you know they said

1074
00:43:51.738 --> 00:43:54.658
that Michael was definitely into the drugs.

1075
00:43:54.658 --> 00:43:56.418
He had lost so much weight, he was

1076
00:43:56.418 --> 00:44:00.578
wearing three layers of clothing to not look so thin.

1077
00:44:00.578 --> 00:44:04.678
But, you know that he had a lot of pressure.

1078
00:44:04.678 --> 00:44:07.738
Here he was, in his addiction,

1079
00:44:07.738 --> 00:44:12.738
having problems sleeping, and he had to go on tour.

1080
00:44:13.178 --> 00:44:16.238
And there were a lot of people saying,

1081
00:44:16.238 --> 00:44:17.538
hey, he can do it, he's healthy.

1082
00:44:17.538 --> 00:44:19.838
And the truth was, he wasn't.

1083
00:44:19.838 --> 00:44:22.118
But he was caught in the Money Life Drain,

1084
00:44:22.118 --> 00:44:24.178
and he needed to go on that tour

1085
00:44:24.178 --> 00:44:26.118
to satisfy his creditors and keep from

1086
00:44:26.118 --> 00:44:27.658
losing some of his property.

1087
00:44:27.658 --> 00:44:32.038
And, so I really feel that that really did lead--

1088
00:44:32.038 --> 00:44:35.058
[Regina] That makes sense.

1089
00:44:35.058 --> 00:44:36.758
<v ->You add the other addictions, and I know</v>

1090
00:44:36.758 --> 00:44:39.398
it's a bigger, more complex story than that,

1091
00:44:39.398 --> 00:44:40.128
but--

1092
00:44:40.128 --> 00:44:41.328
[Regina] But if you're about to lose

1093
00:44:41.328 --> 00:44:42.768
your dream because you've overspent.

1094
00:44:42.768 --> 00:44:46.008
And he had a big dream, and overspent in a big way.

1095
00:44:46.008 --> 00:44:47.728
Of course, he's gotta be suffering

1096
00:44:47.728 --> 00:44:49.868
from severe anxiety and lack of sleep.

1097
00:44:49.868 --> 00:44:51.728
And it makes sense that he would be

1098
00:44:51.728 --> 00:44:54.348
downing all these prescription drugs, and who knows what.

1099
00:44:54.348 --> 00:44:58.088
<v ->And the fact that, you know there's been a lot said</v>

1100
00:44:58.088 --> 00:45:00.448
about the fact that as a child,

1101
00:45:00.448 --> 00:45:02.588
he didn't really have a childhood.

1102
00:45:02.588 --> 00:45:05.568
So that emptiness that we talked about in the beginning,

1103
00:45:05.568 --> 00:45:08.228
that drives a lot of our behaviors with money.

1104
00:45:08.228 --> 00:45:11.948
He talked about that in some of his interviews.

1105
00:45:11.948 --> 00:45:14.188
That feeling of being lonely.

1106
00:45:14.188 --> 00:45:16.728
And so even with all of that money,

1107
00:45:16.728 --> 00:45:19.848
and all of that success, you know,

1108
00:45:19.848 --> 00:45:21.408
this may have been someone who

1109
00:45:21.408 --> 00:45:23.508
really felt a lot of spiritual depletion.

1110
00:45:23.508 --> 00:45:26.088
That really set him up for all of these behaviors.

1111
00:45:26.088 --> 00:45:28.568
So, I felt a lot of empathy and compassion.

1112
00:45:28.568 --> 00:45:30.428
And I also thought, you know,

1113
00:45:30.428 --> 00:45:31.788
there's more to the story here.

1114
00:45:31.788 --> 00:45:33.128
So I was thrilled that they let me

1115
00:45:33.128 --> 00:45:34.448
use that story in the book.

1116
00:45:34.448 --> 00:45:36.208
Because I thought, here's an example,

1117
00:45:36.208 --> 00:45:39.048
we think of people that don't make very much money,

1118
00:45:39.048 --> 00:45:41.448
we think of a certain type of person

1119
00:45:41.448 --> 00:45:43.188
that has money problems,

1120
00:45:43.188 --> 00:45:46.088
but we see the Michael Jacksons, we see the movie stars,

1121
00:45:46.088 --> 00:45:49.428
we see the athletes, we see the lottery winners.

1122
00:45:49.428 --> 00:45:51.748
We see them get large sums of money,

1123
00:45:51.748 --> 00:45:53.368
sometimes quite suddenly,

1124
00:45:53.368 --> 00:45:55.548
and sometimes they work for it over time.

1125
00:45:55.548 --> 00:45:58.508
However, they can be quite ill equipped to handle it,

1126
00:45:58.508 --> 00:46:02.448
and if they don't have a sense of who they are,

1127
00:46:02.448 --> 00:46:06.168
they're really at risk for having end up being

1128
00:46:06.168 --> 00:46:08.648
more of a curse than a blessing.

1129
00:46:08.648 --> 00:46:10.088
And then there's a lot of people who

1130
00:46:10.088 --> 00:46:11.588
have money and do great things.

1131
00:46:11.588 --> 00:46:13.428
So, money is a good thing.

1132
00:46:13.428 --> 00:46:14.988
I don't want anyone to think I'm saying

1133
00:46:14.988 --> 00:46:16.788
money is not a good thing.

1134
00:46:16.788 --> 00:46:18.688
However, you know, we have the people that

1135
00:46:18.688 --> 00:46:21.368
have a lot of money and do great things in the world,

1136
00:46:21.368 --> 00:46:23.608
and then we have a lot of people that go on a very

1137
00:46:23.608 --> 00:46:26.618
self destructive path when they have that kind of money.

1138
00:46:26.618 --> 00:46:27.889
[Regina] And if could almost equate

1139
00:46:27.889 --> 00:46:29.529
the term money with energy.

1140
00:46:29.529 --> 00:46:32.089
That we deserve the energetic support,

1141
00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:35.969
we should have the energetic support that we deserve

1142
00:46:35.969 --> 00:46:39.029
in life, and yet we have to define what that is.

1143
00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:39.889
<v ->What that is.</v>

1144
00:46:39.889 --> 00:46:41.689
And we wanna have role models.

1145
00:46:41.689 --> 00:46:43.409
I really recommend that people

1146
00:46:43.409 --> 00:46:45.889
read biographies of their role models.

1147
00:46:45.889 --> 00:46:48.229
And, of course, a role model for me

1148
00:46:48.229 --> 00:46:49.849
has always been Oprah Winfrey.

1149
00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:53.789
This is someone that absolutely created her passion.

1150
00:46:53.789 --> 00:46:56.229
And she's just retired from the

1151
00:46:56.229 --> 00:46:58.149
25 years of being on the show.

1152
00:46:58.149 --> 00:47:01.849
This is one of the wealthiest women in the world.

1153
00:47:01.849 --> 00:47:05.189
And, she has, she enjoys her life,

1154
00:47:05.189 --> 00:47:07.469
and she makes no qualms about it,

1155
00:47:07.469 --> 00:47:08.809
she doesn't apologize about it.

1156
00:47:08.809 --> 00:47:11.409
But she also gives a lot of money away.

1157
00:47:11.409 --> 00:47:13.709
Has great satisfaction from that.

1158
00:47:13.709 --> 00:47:14.949
And so--

1159
00:47:14.949 --> 00:47:16.529
[Regina] She loves her work.

1160
00:47:16.529 --> 00:47:19.509
<v ->She loves her work, and she's helped</v>

1161
00:47:19.509 --> 00:47:21.189
changed a lot of people's lives.

1162
00:47:21.189 --> 00:47:24.189
So she has the satisfaction of a career,

1163
00:47:24.189 --> 00:47:26.129
where she makes good money,

1164
00:47:26.129 --> 00:47:29.029
but she also has that satisfaction of knowing that she's

1165
00:47:29.029 --> 00:47:31.229
really made a difference in a lot of people's lives.

1166
00:47:31.229 --> 00:47:33.629
To me it doesn't get better than that.

1167
00:47:33.629 --> 00:47:35.669
[Regina] It doesn't, and that is a key for a lot of people.

1168
00:47:35.669 --> 00:47:37.449
They're slogging long, doing what they

1169
00:47:37.449 --> 00:47:39.549
don't like to do to survive so that they can

1170
00:47:39.549 --> 00:47:41.449
spend a little time doing what they do what to do.

1171
00:47:41.449 --> 00:47:43.109
And sometimes the thing you love doing

1172
00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:45.129
is not going to be what makes you money.

1173
00:47:45.129 --> 00:47:46.969
There is an interesting balance in there.

1174
00:47:46.969 --> 00:47:48.609
Dan Melman wrote a book on it,

1175
00:47:48.609 --> 00:47:50.729
called The Four Purposes of Life, which addresses that.

1176
00:47:50.729 --> 00:47:52.789
Does your passion always have

1177
00:47:52.789 --> 00:47:56.089
to be the way in which you earn your bread, so to speak.

1178
00:47:56.089 --> 00:47:58.509
They may not match up, but there are ways

1179
00:47:58.509 --> 00:48:03.409
to fill that creative and spiritual well within yourself,

1180
00:48:03.409 --> 00:48:07.269
so that the other is more exceptable, even.

1181
00:48:07.269 --> 00:48:09.289
It's going for a higher purpose, even if

1182
00:48:09.289 --> 00:48:11.409
it isn't maybe your dream job.

1183
00:48:11.409 --> 00:48:14.789
How do you rectify that, the way you look at it?

1184
00:48:14.789 --> 00:48:17.469
<v ->I think that one of the ways that people rectify it,</v>

1185
00:48:17.469 --> 00:48:19.409
you know, there is this misconception

1186
00:48:19.409 --> 00:48:22.049
that we're all going to find work that we

1187
00:48:22.049 --> 00:48:24.409
absolutely love and then the money will follow.

1188
00:48:24.409 --> 00:48:26.609
And that isn't true for everyone.

1189
00:48:26.609 --> 00:48:28.129
Now, I have a chapter in the book called,

1190
00:48:28.129 --> 00:48:31.129
Is your work working for you and the money isn't?

1191
00:48:31.129 --> 00:48:33.229
Is the money working for you and the work isn't?

1192
00:48:33.229 --> 00:48:35.129
Are neither working for you?

1193
00:48:35.129 --> 00:48:37.989
So, for people who have not been able

1194
00:48:37.989 --> 00:48:40.589
to find the work that they absolutely love,

1195
00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:43.349
it's very important then, that they are creating,

1196
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:47.609
outside of their work, these interest that they have.

1197
00:48:47.609 --> 00:48:49.909
And these things that give their lives meaning.

1198
00:48:49.909 --> 00:48:51.909
So, I think it is a misconception

1199
00:48:51.909 --> 00:48:54.229
that do what we want and the money will follow.

1200
00:48:54.229 --> 00:48:56.849
But we can adjust, if we really are in a

1201
00:48:56.849 --> 00:48:58.909
very unhealthy work environment

1202
00:48:58.909 --> 00:49:00.809
then it is important to look at that.

1203
00:49:00.809 --> 00:49:02.529
And again, people can't look at that

1204
00:49:02.529 --> 00:49:04.449
if they are in survival mode with money.

1205
00:49:04.449 --> 00:49:08.526
And I quite often ended up feeling like a career counselor.

1206
00:49:08.526 --> 00:49:11.967
Because as people would start improving

1207
00:49:11.967 --> 00:49:15.327
their finanacial situation, now they could entertain

1208
00:49:15.327 --> 00:49:18.766
this concept of right livelihood and their work.

1209
00:49:18.766 --> 00:49:21.806
And quite often, it was, no they could make their work

1210
00:49:21.806 --> 00:49:24.147
manageable and they could make the most out of it.

1211
00:49:24.147 --> 00:49:25.787
But it was with the rest of their life, then,

1212
00:49:25.787 --> 00:49:28.346
that they are going to meet this other need,

1213
00:49:28.346 --> 00:49:30.806
of their creativity and making sure that they are

1214
00:49:30.806 --> 00:49:33.146
making a difference in what's important to them.

1215
00:49:33.146 --> 00:49:35.067
[Regina] That makes perfect sense.

1216
00:49:35.067 --> 00:49:39.807
And this gets us to the story of enough.

1217
00:49:39.807 --> 00:49:42.929
For some people there isn't enough.

1218
00:49:42.929 --> 00:49:46.969
And they just have to acquire more and more and more.

1219
00:49:46.969 --> 00:49:49.374
Whether they're in a thing they love or not.

1220
00:49:49.374 --> 00:49:51.675
There is just no such thing as enough.

1221
00:49:51.675 --> 00:49:55.474
How do you define what is enough,

1222
00:49:55.474 --> 00:49:58.695
for you as an individual?

1223
00:49:58.695 --> 00:50:01.655
<v ->That's a fantastic question.</v>

1224
00:50:01.655 --> 00:50:04.254
There's an exercise I have in the book,

1225
00:50:04.254 --> 00:50:06.255
and I also do at workshops,

1226
00:50:06.255 --> 00:50:08.335
where I take people through a meditation

1227
00:50:08.335 --> 00:50:10.615
looking at what their earning ceilings are.

1228
00:50:10.615 --> 00:50:14.555
And what we do is, we go to different levels

1229
00:50:14.555 --> 00:50:16.635
and we start with a very low level

1230
00:50:16.635 --> 00:50:18.095
and then we get to a high level.

1231
00:50:18.095 --> 00:50:19.494
And you can see where people have

1232
00:50:19.494 --> 00:50:21.054
reached their earning ceiling.

1233
00:50:21.054 --> 00:50:22.495
You know their eyes will pop open,

1234
00:50:22.495 --> 00:50:23.915
or they'll start giggling, they feel

1235
00:50:23.915 --> 00:50:26.014
very uncomfortable in their body.

1236
00:50:26.014 --> 00:50:28.635
And in all the years that I've been doing this,

1237
00:50:28.635 --> 00:50:32.274
I've only had one person who realized

1238
00:50:32.274 --> 00:50:34.834
that she could be enough even if

1239
00:50:34.834 --> 00:50:38.274
she was at this very, very low income level.

1240
00:50:38.274 --> 00:50:41.975
Like I said, in all the, with all the people

1241
00:50:41.975 --> 00:50:43.575
I've done this with, it's only one.

1242
00:50:43.575 --> 00:50:46.795
And what she said is she would make her life enough.

1243
00:50:46.795 --> 00:50:50.055
She would look for other people in a similar situation.

1244
00:50:50.055 --> 00:50:53.294
She would look at sharing resources,

1245
00:50:53.294 --> 00:50:57.135
perhaps sharing a home, perhaps sharing cars,

1246
00:50:57.135 --> 00:51:00.214
perhaps putting gardens in and having,

1247
00:51:00.214 --> 00:51:03.095
she would just find other people in this situation.

1248
00:51:03.095 --> 00:51:06.524
And so, the big question for a lot of people,

1249
00:51:06.524 --> 00:51:11.475
and I feel that the other part of this that's important is,

1250
00:51:11.475 --> 00:51:16.474
if we know that we want to have a certain lifestyle.

1251
00:51:16.474 --> 00:51:18.274
And, let's say a school teacher, for example,

1252
00:51:18.274 --> 00:51:22.314
who doesn't make very much money, but they love their work.

1253
00:51:22.314 --> 00:51:26.654
There has to be a match between the money they make

1254
00:51:26.654 --> 00:51:29.034
and the lifestyle they choose.

1255
00:51:29.034 --> 00:51:31.634
Because otherwise, here they have work that they love,

1256
00:51:31.634 --> 00:51:33.254
but it's never going to be enough,

1257
00:51:33.254 --> 00:51:36.994
because they don't shop and they don't live

1258
00:51:36.994 --> 00:51:39.914
the lifestyle based on the salary that they have.

1259
00:51:39.914 --> 00:51:43.094
And so, that's one of the things about getting to enough,

1260
00:51:43.094 --> 00:51:45.114
is that if we do have work that we love,

1261
00:51:45.114 --> 00:51:49.254
then we have to adjust our lifestyle to meet that.

1262
00:51:49.254 --> 00:51:52.054
So, a school teacher, and I have someone

1263
00:51:52.054 --> 00:51:53.614
in mind thinking about that.

1264
00:51:53.614 --> 00:51:57.194
She shops at certain places and not others.

1265
00:51:57.194 --> 00:52:01.494
She feels rich because she absolutely loves what she does.

1266
00:52:01.494 --> 00:52:03.774
And so, it's enough.

1267
00:52:03.774 --> 00:52:06.034
And so when there is this disconnect between

1268
00:52:06.034 --> 00:52:07.514
the lifestyle that we wanna have,

1269
00:52:07.514 --> 00:52:09.354
and the work that we are going to do,

1270
00:52:09.354 --> 00:52:11.354
this is where a lot of under earning, you know,

1271
00:52:11.354 --> 00:52:13.214
it feels like we're under earning.

1272
00:52:13.214 --> 00:52:15.074
But if that's a choice and we want to stay there,

1273
00:52:15.074 --> 00:52:17.434
then we have to bring the lifestyle to meet that.

1274
00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:21.494
If our lifestyle desires are here, and we don't have enough,

1275
00:52:21.494 --> 00:52:24.174
then we may have to change our careers

1276
00:52:24.174 --> 00:52:26.834
and think about how we are going to earn more money.

1277
00:52:26.834 --> 00:52:29.294
So, it all starts, you know, as I said,

1278
00:52:29.294 --> 00:52:31.814
it's kinda this outside/inside job.

1279
00:52:31.814 --> 00:52:36.014
As we are more and more in touch with meeting our needs,

1280
00:52:36.014 --> 00:52:38.154
then we can get to some of our wants and desires.

1281
00:52:38.154 --> 00:52:41.194
Then we can explore this work thing.

1282
00:52:41.194 --> 00:52:43.874
And hopefully doing that month after month after month,

1283
00:52:43.874 --> 00:52:48.874
people can start identifying for themselves, what is enough.

1284
00:52:49.894 --> 00:52:53.534
One of my best days recently, was a day with my family

1285
00:52:53.534 --> 00:52:57.034
celebrating my oldest grandson's high school graduation.

1286
00:52:57.034 --> 00:53:01.654
And I felt so alive and so, you know,

1287
00:53:01.654 --> 00:53:04.174
the world was just fantastic because

1288
00:53:04.174 --> 00:53:06.794
I had this whole day of being with my family.

1289
00:53:06.794 --> 00:53:08.174
You know, from the little kids,

1290
00:53:08.174 --> 00:53:10.314
to my daughters and their husbands,

1291
00:53:10.314 --> 00:53:12.274
and some ex-husbands were there,

1292
00:53:12.274 --> 00:53:14.614
you know, it was just a wonderful time.

1293
00:53:14.614 --> 00:53:17.274
And so that's what we want, that's what enough is.

1294
00:53:17.274 --> 00:53:20.534
Where what we're doing, it's not

1295
00:53:20.534 --> 00:53:23.894
dependent on the money that we have.

1296
00:53:23.894 --> 00:53:26.154
Now, I do wanna say that I'm very empathetic

1297
00:53:26.154 --> 00:53:28.254
with people who really do not have money,

1298
00:53:28.254 --> 00:53:31.434
they really are worrying about how to put food on the table,

1299
00:53:31.434 --> 00:53:32.454
I've been there.

1300
00:53:32.454 --> 00:53:33.974
But, I'm also talking about if

1301
00:53:33.974 --> 00:53:35.654
we wanna get to a place of enough,

1302
00:53:35.654 --> 00:53:37.674
there has to be congruence between

1303
00:53:37.674 --> 00:53:39.554
our lifestyle and what we're earning.

1304
00:53:39.554 --> 00:53:41.394
[Regina] We just have to be really honest with ourselves.

1305
00:53:41.394 --> 00:53:42.994
<v ->Otherwise, you know it's the credit cards,</v>

1306
00:53:42.994 --> 00:53:45.654
then all of a sudden, even the work that we love

1307
00:53:45.654 --> 00:53:48.314
is being compromised because we live beyond our means.

1308
00:53:48.314 --> 00:53:50.214
And then that stresses us.

1309
00:53:50.214 --> 00:53:51.654
We've got the credit card debt,

1310
00:53:51.654 --> 00:53:53.554
the money is going to make the banks rich,

1311
00:53:53.554 --> 00:53:56.074
and really impacting us, so.

1312
00:53:56.074 --> 00:53:57.894
[Regina] Back to our hierarchy of values.

1313
00:53:57.894 --> 00:53:59.174
It comes down to that.

1314
00:53:59.174 --> 00:54:01.554
And we said we'd get to it, and before we say goodbye,

1315
00:54:01.554 --> 00:54:02.754
I want to get to it.

1316
00:54:02.754 --> 00:54:05.154
This whole new notion, oh my god,

1317
00:54:05.154 --> 00:54:06.934
I'm no longer credit worthy.

1318
00:54:06.934 --> 00:54:09.674
This is a whole new phenomena, really.

1319
00:54:09.674 --> 00:54:13.754
And it has a huge impact on society at large right now.

1320
00:54:13.754 --> 00:54:16.314
<v ->You know, I call it the public shame sheet.</v>

1321
00:54:16.314 --> 00:54:18.014
The credit report.

1322
00:54:18.014 --> 00:54:20.474
And I have had people, and I went through this.

1323
00:54:20.474 --> 00:54:22.334
I tried to protect my credit.

1324
00:54:22.334 --> 00:54:27.074
25, 26 years ago, I would rather go without food

1325
00:54:27.074 --> 00:54:29.634
then think of not paying a credit card bill.

1326
00:54:29.634 --> 00:54:32.884
And what happened, I eventually got to the place

1327
00:54:32.884 --> 00:54:34.944
where I couldn't.

1328
00:54:34.944 --> 00:54:37.344
Now, I'm fortunate in that I never filed bankruptcy,

1329
00:54:37.344 --> 00:54:40.604
I always paid everything back, but it took me a lot longer.

1330
00:54:40.604 --> 00:54:43.244
And it definitely impacted my credit report.

1331
00:54:43.244 --> 00:54:46.844
What I found, if people are committed to a recovery process,

1332
00:54:46.844 --> 00:54:49.344
their credit report is not going to

1333
00:54:49.344 --> 00:54:51.064
stop them from creating their life.

1334
00:54:51.064 --> 00:54:54.564
There's this false sense of the credit report then

1335
00:54:54.564 --> 00:54:56.564
is going to give us more credit.

1336
00:54:56.564 --> 00:54:58.564
That's the last thing that we need,

1337
00:54:58.564 --> 00:55:01.004
if that's what's gotten us in trouble in the first place.

1338
00:55:01.004 --> 00:55:03.144
But it it, there's a lot of pressure,

1339
00:55:03.144 --> 00:55:05.564
and I am not minimizing that.

1340
00:55:05.564 --> 00:55:07.704
Employers can look at our credit reports.

1341
00:55:07.704 --> 00:55:10.504
There's a lot of, we may pay more interest on things.

1342
00:55:10.504 --> 00:55:12.124
We may not be able to buy a new car.

1343
00:55:12.124 --> 00:55:14.004
We may not be able to buy a new house.

1344
00:55:14.004 --> 00:55:16.724
However, we do not wanna be caught in,

1345
00:55:16.724 --> 00:55:20.284
we will sacrifice everything to protect the credit report.

1346
00:55:20.284 --> 00:55:21.924
[Regina] Yes, absolutely.

1347
00:55:21.924 --> 00:55:26.924
And, there's quite a bit about saving your way out of debt,

1348
00:55:26.924 --> 00:55:29.604
and getting back into some patterns of saving.

1349
00:55:29.604 --> 00:55:31.504
So that if something does come up,

1350
00:55:31.504 --> 00:55:34.064
you don't have to put it on a 20% credit card,

1351
00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:35.644
you can just pay it.

1352
00:55:35.644 --> 00:55:38.024
So,don't just throw all your money at your credit card.

1353
00:55:38.024 --> 00:55:40.284
Take some and put some money aside.

1354
00:55:40.284 --> 00:55:43.024
And many, many other very practical and sound

1355
00:55:43.024 --> 00:55:45.764
pieces of advice, but I think what I love most

1356
00:55:45.764 --> 00:55:48.084
about the book is the fact that your taking people through

1357
00:55:48.084 --> 00:55:51.504
this really deep, I think, pyscho-spiritual

1358
00:55:51.504 --> 00:55:53.794
journey of themselves to assess this

1359
00:55:53.794 --> 00:55:55.494
and rebuild their lives.

1360
00:55:55.494 --> 00:55:57.154
<v ->And I do love the the chapter,</v>

1361
00:55:57.154 --> 00:56:00.034
and I think it's very interesting for people

1362
00:56:00.034 --> 00:56:02.474
to think about saving their way out of debt.

1363
00:56:02.474 --> 00:56:04.474
When they explore their relationship to debt,

1364
00:56:04.474 --> 00:56:06.734
but also their relationship to savings.

1365
00:56:06.734 --> 00:56:10.354
And you can't stay out of debt, unless you have savings.

1366
00:56:10.354 --> 00:56:12.594
['Regina] There you go, and so much more.

1367
00:56:12.594 --> 00:56:14.674
It's a beautiful book and thank you for writing it,

1368
00:56:14.674 --> 00:56:17.114
on behalf of all of us that are listening

1369
00:56:17.114 --> 00:56:19.554
and could certainly use some of that wisdom,

1370
00:56:19.554 --> 00:56:22.234
And thank you for your time.

1371
00:56:22.234 --> 00:56:24.324
I'm very happy to have met you

1372
00:56:24.324 --> 00:56:25.604
and had a chance to talk with you.

1373
00:56:25.604 --> 00:56:27.684
<v ->It's been my pleasure Regina, thank you so much.</v>

1374
00:56:27.684 --> 00:56:32.124
<v ->I love Karen's pragmatic and comapssionate way</v>

1375
00:56:32.124 --> 00:56:35.004
of view people and their realitionship with money.

1376
00:56:35.004 --> 00:56:37.544
To go deeper into your own internal work regarding money

1377
00:56:37.544 --> 00:56:40.544
you can buy Karen's book at through major bookseller.

1378
00:56:40.544 --> 00:56:42.164
If you're in need of coaching she can be reached

1379

1380
00:56:44.504 --> 00:56:48.504
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
