1
00:00:00.727 --> 00:00:03.585
<v ->This one is going to require you to suspend disbelief</v>

2
00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:05.100
and use your intuition.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.073
We're talking about Billy Meier.

4
00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:08.565
Perhaps, the most controversial

5
00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:11.260
of all Contact-D cases on record.

6
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.976
Michael Horne is his liaison to the English speaking world.

7
00:00:14.976 --> 00:00:17.717
A one-armed Swiss man with a colorful history.

8
00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:19.242
Meier is said to have been contacted

9
00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:22.164
by beings called the Plejarans from the age of five

10
00:00:22.164 --> 00:00:25.116
until present time, a span of several decades.

11
00:00:25.116 --> 00:00:27.132
While many would dismiss such claims,

12
00:00:27.132 --> 00:00:28.636
some of the facts surrounding the case

13
00:00:28.636 --> 00:00:30.332
cause pause for thought.

14
00:00:30.332 --> 00:00:34.214
In an archive of over 24,000 pages of documented contacts,

15
00:00:34.214 --> 00:00:36.700
information given to him about future events

16
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.503
has often turned out to be remarkably accurate.

17
00:00:39.503 --> 00:00:41.967
His life story has been documented in a film called,

18
00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:43.662
The Silent Revolution.

19
00:00:43.662 --> 00:00:46.254
And one truth that surfaces again and again is that Billy

20
00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:48.456
was no ordinary man.

21
00:00:49.998 --> 00:00:51.891
(electronic music)

22
00:00:57.678 --> 00:01:01.107
<v Voiceover>Billy Meier is certainly one of the more</v>

23
00:01:01.107 --> 00:01:05.469
enigmatic and controversial people in this entire arena

24
00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:07.938
of Ufology, as they call it,

25
00:01:07.938 --> 00:01:09.357
but that's not really what it is.

26
00:01:09.357 --> 00:01:12.631
It's really about passing through wisdoms

27
00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:14.210
that serve humanity.

28
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.036
From everything that I've seen, reading some of his papers

29
00:01:17.036 --> 00:01:19.479
through the years and, certainly have not read all 24,000

30
00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.737
pages of them.
(laughs)

31
00:01:21.337 --> 00:01:25.895
But let's talk about this man and how this was initiated

32
00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:29.071
with him because this contact started

33
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:31.141
very early in his life.

34
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:33.039
Can you just launch right in on that?

35
00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.663
<v ->Sure, as I recall, and there's a lot to recall</v>

36
00:01:35.663 --> 00:01:38.148
in Billy's whole story.

37
00:01:38.148 --> 00:01:40.868
He was about five years old, living in a nice, rural

38
00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:43.375
part of Switzerland, beautiful country that it is.

39
00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:47.566
And, I think he first started to receive telepathic messages

40
00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:51.395
from a voice, grown man's voice that he understood

41
00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:53.529
in his head and it was a little perplexing.

42
00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:55.950
And one day as he went out to play

43
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.515
and there was a forest adjacent to his home and property.

44
00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:03.629
And he went out into this forest and there in a clearing

45
00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:07.608
was a pear shaped craft, sitting on some form struts

46
00:02:07.608 --> 00:02:08.856
or what have you.

47
00:02:08.856 --> 00:02:11.042
And standing in front of it was this elderly looking man

48
00:02:11.042 --> 00:02:13.591
who appeared to be about 90 years old

49
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:16.268
and what Billy said, at the time, reminded him

50
00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:18.519
of illustrations that he'd seen

51
00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.377
of deep-sea diving suits without the helmet.

52
00:02:21.377 --> 00:02:23.116
He felt no fear in the man's presence.

53
00:02:23.116 --> 00:02:25.111
He, as a matter of fact, felt it was very safe

54
00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:27.734
and comfortable to communicate with the man.

55
00:02:27.734 --> 00:02:28.750
And that began,

56
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.000
(clears throat)

57
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.811
Excuse me, a series of contacts with this man

58
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:34.574
whose name was Sfath.

59
00:02:34.574 --> 00:02:37.816
And those contacts, initiated initially telepathically

60
00:02:37.816 --> 00:02:40.771
and then conducted physically as well as telepathically

61
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:42.925
there on for about 11 years.

62
00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:46.669
Now, these contacts held place outside

63
00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:48.482
in a meadow or field.

64
00:02:48.482 --> 00:02:50.552
They took place on board Sfath's craft

65
00:02:50.552 --> 00:02:53.453
and also above the earth, in different places

66
00:02:53.453 --> 00:02:57.282
that Sfath, supposedly, took young Eduard Albert Meier

67
00:02:57.282 --> 00:02:59.820
to show him different things, different places.

68
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.754
He was introduced to people who either were or would become

69
00:03:02.754 --> 00:03:05.260
major players on the world stage

70
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.041
when he was still relatively young.

71
00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:10.156
He met Mahatma Gandhi, it was the first person.

72
00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:14.593
And this man, Sfath, had given him, to wear at these times

73
00:03:14.593 --> 00:03:16.897
a small translator device that would clip on

74
00:03:16.897 --> 00:03:19.777
either his shirt pocket or be fastened on him some way.

75
00:03:19.777 --> 00:03:21.920
So when he would meet people who language he didn't speak

76
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.747
they could speak to each other and understand each other.

77
00:03:24.747 --> 00:03:27.648
So they could speak to him in their native language,

78
00:03:27.648 --> 00:03:29.141
he would understand in his own language.

79
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.786
He would speak, they would hear it in their language.

80
00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:34.410
And, it's--

81
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.637
<v Voiceover>That's mind-blowing.</v>

82
00:03:35.637 --> 00:03:36.842
<v ->It is mind-blowing.</v>

83
00:03:36.842 --> 00:03:38.794
And when he tells the story in the film,

84
00:03:38.794 --> 00:03:41.237
it's very matter-of-fact to him, this was his experience.

85
00:03:41.237 --> 00:03:45.418
Though in the early stages of these experiences,

86
00:03:45.418 --> 00:03:48.063
it was bit, even, troubling to him.

87
00:03:48.063 --> 00:03:50.463
He wasn't sure if this was something he should do.

88
00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:52.382
So he confided in the parish priest,

89
00:03:52.382 --> 00:03:54.452
Father Emmanuel Zimmerman.

90
00:03:54.452 --> 00:03:58.995
And Father Zimmerman was a man who had been,

91
00:03:58.995 --> 00:04:02.014
apparently, also telepathically contacted

92
00:04:02.014 --> 00:04:04.894
by this man Sfath, a Plejaran,

93
00:04:04.894 --> 00:04:09.387
and prepared for this young boy to come to him seeking his,

94
00:04:12.527 --> 00:04:15.736
Well, to be a confidant to him on the earthly plane.

95
00:04:15.736 --> 00:04:18.702
He would need the assurance that this was not some work

96
00:04:18.702 --> 00:04:20.237
of the devil, quote, unquote.

97
00:04:20.237 --> 00:04:21.635
Let's remember, young Eduard Albert Meier

98
00:04:21.635 --> 00:04:25.666
is being raised in a religious small village in Switzerland

99
00:04:25.666 --> 00:04:27.970
and he's confiding in the parish priest,

100
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.842
who apart from being a religious leader for his people

101
00:04:31.842 --> 00:04:34.423
is, on top of that, somebody who has

102
00:04:34.423 --> 00:04:37.676
a higher understanding himself of the true nature of things,

103
00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:41.879
and tries to move his parishioners, if you will,

104
00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:46.214
in a more evolved direction gently without attempting

105
00:04:46.214 --> 00:04:49.437
to shock them with anything pertaining to the UFO thing.

106
00:04:49.437 --> 00:04:51.378
I don't think he ever shared it.

107
00:04:51.378 --> 00:04:54.194
Or without trying to present to them

108
00:04:54.194 --> 00:04:57.415
the glaring contradictions that he, himself was probably,

109
00:04:57.415 --> 00:04:59.996
made aware of if he didn't already know.

110
00:04:59.996 --> 00:05:02.183
So, my take on it is that he was probably

111
00:05:02.183 --> 00:05:05.383
someone who had his own part in this mission,

112
00:05:05.383 --> 00:05:08.796
in this lineage of people showing up time after time

113
00:05:08.796 --> 00:05:09.916
to do different things.

114
00:05:09.916 --> 00:05:14.161
<v Voiceover>And so he continued into the contact.</v>

115
00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:15.974
The contact has continued even up through today?

116
00:05:15.974 --> 00:05:16.689
<v ->Yes.</v>

117
00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:19.387
<v Voiceover>But the actual transmissions</v>

118
00:05:19.387 --> 00:05:21.200
that are made available through FIGU

119
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.568
and also through your site, They Fly,

120
00:05:23.568 --> 00:05:27.696
and some of this is shared in the documentary as well.

121
00:05:27.696 --> 00:05:31.226
These transmissions of life lessons for humanity,

122
00:05:31.226 --> 00:05:33.018
when did they begin?

123
00:05:33.018 --> 00:05:34.895
The ones that are made available, I've seen them

124
00:05:34.895 --> 00:05:37.423
from the 70's, 80's 90's and so forth.

125
00:05:37.423 --> 00:05:40.807
<v ->Well, actually, and this is, I'm a little rusty</v>

126
00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:42.503
on everything about it, there's so much.

127
00:05:42.503 --> 00:05:45.564
Meier, himself, is said to have published a track

128
00:05:45.564 --> 00:05:48.231
on meditation when he was about 10.

129
00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:49.073
<v Voiceover>Oh.</v>

130
00:05:49.073 --> 00:05:50.812
<v ->And that was then taken up by, I think,</v>

131
00:05:50.812 --> 00:05:53.020
a Buddhist organization that published it.

132
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.373
He wrote The Rules of Man, which we link

133
00:05:57.373 --> 00:05:59.685
on my website, They Fly.

134
00:05:59.685 --> 00:06:04.357
Where he has a pretty significant list of the way humans

135
00:06:04.357 --> 00:06:06.522
should conduct themselves.

136
00:06:06.522 --> 00:06:10.980
Spiritual and other type of information.

137
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.935
And I think he published that by the time he was 14.

138
00:06:13.935 --> 00:06:16.740
So he also published his first letter that's on my website

139
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.161
in 1951, he was 14.

140
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:21.038
And those were prophesies warning of such things as

141
00:06:21.038 --> 00:06:24.014
global warming and environmental disasters.

142
00:06:24.014 --> 00:06:26.211
And information that he knew about.

143
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:31.809
His tutorage with Sfath encompassed a lot of territory.

144
00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:35.259
He was shown things yet to come.

145
00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:36.998
Things from the far distant past.

146
00:06:36.998 --> 00:06:39.504
His own previous lifetimes in other,

147
00:06:39.504 --> 00:06:41.477
we might call them, incarceration at times.

148
00:06:41.477 --> 00:06:42.341
(laughs)

149
00:06:42.341 --> 00:06:44.080
Just as we all suffer.
<v Voiceover>Reincarnation.</v>

150
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.245
<v ->Or reincarceration.</v>

151
00:06:46.245 --> 00:06:50.842
So he was given quite a broad view of a lot things

152
00:06:50.842 --> 00:06:52.549
and, til this day, there are many things

153
00:06:52.549 --> 00:06:54.863
he can not speak about that he is privy to.

154
00:06:54.863 --> 00:06:57.562
<v Voiceover>And at the same time, he was having this</v>

155
00:06:57.562 --> 00:07:02.073
very colorful life as a young man.

156
00:07:02.073 --> 00:07:05.134
Can you talk a little about how his life bounced along

157
00:07:05.134 --> 00:07:07.993
in the flesh, in this incarceration, as you say.

158
00:07:07.993 --> 00:07:08.846
(laughs)

159
00:07:08.846 --> 00:07:13.846
<v ->Well, he got into a lot of trouble, sometimes passively.</v>

160
00:07:13.987 --> 00:07:17.912
Meaning, he became the target of various kinds of

161
00:07:17.912 --> 00:07:18.776
(clears throat)
pardon me,

162
00:07:18.776 --> 00:07:20.398
bullying and what have you

163
00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:22.861
because as his contact were developing with Sfath

164
00:07:22.861 --> 00:07:27.490
and as he was getting more than an other worldly education.

165
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.925
Even other historical, something huge

166
00:07:30.925 --> 00:07:32.898
by the time he was seven, he was said to have

167
00:07:32.898 --> 00:07:35.479
the thinking capacity of a 35 year old man.

168
00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:37.964
He's still with his contemporaries and his family

169
00:07:37.964 --> 00:07:39.426
in this lovely little village.

170
00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:42.451
And everybody's kind of marching along eating cheese,

171
00:07:42.451 --> 00:07:43.239
(laughs)

172
00:07:43.239 --> 00:07:45.004
and doing what they do in Switzerland.

173
00:07:45.004 --> 00:07:47.762
And so, in the midst of all of this,

174
00:07:47.762 --> 00:07:51.570
he's withdrawing into himself, in many ways.

175
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.428
So he becomes a target for bullies and what have you.

176
00:07:54.428 --> 00:07:56.562
As we say in the film, he suffers some abuse

177
00:07:56.562 --> 00:07:59.185
at the hands of a woman who hits him with a towel,

178
00:07:59.185 --> 00:08:01.159
he takes it back and slaps her with it.

179
00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:04.209
Next thing you know, he's being put into reform schools,

180
00:08:04.209 --> 00:08:05.862
institutions, whatever.

181
00:08:05.862 --> 00:08:08.988
At some point, he runs away and joins a foreign legion,

182
00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:11.687
French foreign legion when he was still in his young teens.

183
00:08:11.687 --> 00:08:14.332
Maybe 14, 15, 16, somewhere in there.

184
00:08:14.332 --> 00:08:17.052
And after a short period of time, he realizes

185
00:08:17.052 --> 00:08:18.950
this is not the place for him, this was, as he says,

186
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.252
"It's not the way."

187
00:08:20.252 --> 00:08:22.012
Because this was a outfit of men

188
00:08:22.012 --> 00:08:23.803
who were pretty tough characters--

189
00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:24.753
<v Voiceover>Mercenaries.</v>

190
00:08:24.753 --> 00:08:27.291
<v ->Mercenaries taught to kill, be effective at it.</v>

191
00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:30.374
They had their own code and that's that thing.

192
00:08:30.374 --> 00:08:33.808
And this was, he's venturing forth in his own life

193
00:08:33.808 --> 00:08:37.616
coming from this, otherwise, relatively sheltered existence.

194
00:08:37.616 --> 00:08:39.195
Unless you take into the fact

195
00:08:39.195 --> 00:08:41.104
that he's already been shown the moon.

196
00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:44.218
And here his is, now in the French foreign legion

197
00:08:44.218 --> 00:08:47.578
so he decides to leave and he walks out across the desert.

198
00:08:47.578 --> 00:08:50.298
Something that has not been accomplished by too many people

199
00:08:50.298 --> 00:08:51.386
from what I understand.

200
00:08:51.386 --> 00:08:53.018
And he survives that experience,

201
00:08:53.018 --> 00:08:54.735
he comes back to Switzerland and he turns himself in

202
00:08:54.735 --> 00:08:56.591
to face whatever punishment he...

203
00:08:56.591 --> 00:09:00.324
We tell a lot about this in the film and how he learns

204
00:09:00.324 --> 00:09:03.588
many different trades and he goes on then, after that

205
00:09:03.588 --> 00:09:06.606
he starts to travel broadly and he goes through about

206
00:09:06.606 --> 00:09:08.601
42 different countries, primarily on foot,

207
00:09:08.601 --> 00:09:10.553
hitchhiking and what have you.

208
00:09:10.553 --> 00:09:12.686
Something like 140,000 miles.

209
00:09:12.686 --> 00:09:15.640
He's meeting again with all the, you know, many people

210
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.965
who are becoming major players in the world stage.

211
00:09:17.965 --> 00:09:20.728
This time his contacts have moved to being

212
00:09:20.728 --> 00:09:23.832
with a woman called, Asket, who comes from

213
00:09:23.832 --> 00:09:27.341
the Dal Universe, so the separate adjoining universe to ours

214
00:09:27.341 --> 00:09:30.402
And she is the person who had also taken him

215
00:09:30.402 --> 00:09:32.055
time travel trips.

216
00:09:32.055 --> 00:09:34.007
Taught him many things.

217
00:09:34.007 --> 00:09:36.514
Given him a lot information about these times.

218
00:09:36.514 --> 00:09:38.839
And even back then, starting in the 50's,

219
00:09:38.839 --> 00:09:42.316
she was telling him about what would be coming

220
00:09:42.316 --> 00:09:45.228
during these times towards the end of the last millennium

221
00:09:45.228 --> 00:09:46.358
and this one.

222
00:09:46.358 --> 00:09:47.894
With fundamentalists, religions

223
00:09:47.894 --> 00:09:49.174
(coughs)
excuse me,

224
00:09:49.174 --> 00:09:52.843
bringing tremendous amount of damage to the world

225
00:09:52.843 --> 00:09:56.694
that this will be the culmination of the irrationality

226
00:09:56.694 --> 00:09:59.499
of human beings that can be traced back

227
00:09:59.499 --> 00:10:02.496
in it's causative sense, in many cases,

228
00:10:02.496 --> 00:10:05.098
the distant ancestors of the some of the extra terrestrials

229
00:10:05.098 --> 00:10:07.904
who are trying to assist us to correct this

230
00:10:07.904 --> 00:10:10.683
before we wipe ourselves off the planet.

231
00:10:10.683 --> 00:10:14.617
<v Voiceover>Yes, and we're going to get into that.</v>

232
00:10:14.617 --> 00:10:17.572
Do not forget that part, okay?

233
00:10:17.572 --> 00:10:18.564
<v ->I'll remember.</v>

234
00:10:18.564 --> 00:10:22.329
<v Voiceover>But, so let's continue there, to bring him</v>

235
00:10:22.329 --> 00:10:25.230
kind of, up to where he is, more or less, now.

236
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.338
<v ->Sure, well, just to get to the next phase.</v>

237
00:10:27.338 --> 00:10:30.112
He was known as the phantom for a while in the Middle East,

238
00:10:30.112 --> 00:10:32.682
West Pakistan, India and, I think, Turkey.

239
00:10:32.682 --> 00:10:34.890
They're police departments had enlisted his services

240
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.090
to help bring in serial killers, mass murderers.

241
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.418
When you look at the photos of him in the film

242
00:10:41.418 --> 00:10:43.721
and you see this guy in a Swiss leather jacket

243
00:10:43.721 --> 00:10:47.710
with the little cross there and wearing a Arab headress

244
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.172
and packing--
<v Voiceover>I love that.</v>

245
00:10:49.172 --> 00:10:51.198
sufficient weapons to you know--

246
00:10:51.198 --> 00:10:52.265
(laughs)

247
00:10:52.265 --> 00:10:53.449
take on an army.
<v Voiceover>I love that photo.</v>

248
00:10:53.449 --> 00:10:55.027
<v ->Those are incredible photos.</v>

249
00:10:55.027 --> 00:10:56.702
And then you've got this photo with him in the middle

250
00:10:56.702 --> 00:10:58.419
of a bunch of Jordanian partisans in the desert.

251
00:10:58.419 --> 00:11:00.670
It's kind of almost like he's like this zealot

252
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.151
of the UFO world.

253
00:11:02.151 --> 00:11:02.642
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

254
00:11:02.642 --> 00:11:04.658
<v ->You turn around and there's Billy in the midst</v>

255
00:11:04.658 --> 00:11:06.450
of some kind of situation

256
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.049
and they certainly were situations,

257
00:11:08.049 --> 00:11:10.044
not for the faint of heart.

258
00:11:10.044 --> 00:11:12.902
He says there are many things that he's not proud of

259
00:11:12.902 --> 00:11:15.601
that happened in his life and there are things

260
00:11:15.601 --> 00:11:16.924
we did not cover in the film.

261
00:11:16.924 --> 00:11:18.662
The loss of three great loves in his life.

262
00:11:18.662 --> 00:11:21.499
Each one snatched tragically from him.

263
00:11:21.499 --> 00:11:24.400
Through either, murder or natural catastrophe.

264
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.437
He has had every kind of situation that I would not

265
00:11:30.437 --> 00:11:32.988
want to partake of myself.

266
00:11:32.988 --> 00:11:35.260
And seems to have been able to survive it

267
00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.881
and he claims he's learned from everything.

268
00:11:36.881 --> 00:11:39.366
He would not change the circumstance of his losing his arm.

269
00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:41.478
He learned from it, things that he needed to--

270
00:11:41.478 --> 00:11:42.694
<v Voiceover>How did he lose his arm?</v>

271
00:11:42.694 --> 00:11:44.827
<v ->He got on a bus on warm day in Turkey,</v>

272
00:11:44.827 --> 00:11:47.569
he sat down a, the window was open

273
00:11:47.569 --> 00:11:49.638
and there was a drunk driving a bus or truck

274
00:11:49.638 --> 00:11:51.398
in the opposite direction.

275
00:11:51.398 --> 00:11:52.678
There was a collision, he was thrown

276
00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:54.768
through the window, out the bus.

277
00:11:54.768 --> 00:11:57.648
His arm was so badly damaged that it had to be amputated.

278
00:11:57.648 --> 00:12:00.176
I think that he was lying in a ditch for several hours

279
00:12:00.176 --> 00:12:02.010
before people heard him moaning

280
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:03.312
and they took him to a hospital.

281
00:12:03.312 --> 00:12:06.650
A rather primitive amputation was performed

282
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:10.394
and he was warned about this 10 years in advance.

283
00:12:10.394 --> 00:12:13.071
The Plejaran told him, "You will have to get used

284
00:12:13.071 --> 00:12:14.746
to living your life with one hand.

285
00:12:14.746 --> 00:12:16.740
We can not prevent what comes to you.

286
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.639
In about 10 years, you'll lose your arm."

287
00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:21.433
And he said the only time he thought about it past that

288
00:12:21.433 --> 00:12:24.825
was, maybe, a month or two prior to the actual incident.

289
00:12:24.825 --> 00:12:28.441
He was in India, on a beach and he saw a man with his family

290
00:12:28.441 --> 00:12:31.459
who only had one arm, you know, he'd lost an arm.

291
00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:33.571
And he said, it was only at that point that he thought,

292
00:12:33.571 --> 00:12:36.782
again, about the fact that he would lose his arm someday.

293
00:12:36.782 --> 00:12:39.114
I think that would be enough

294
00:12:39.114 --> 00:12:40.928
to drive a lot of people pretty crazy.

295
00:12:40.928 --> 00:12:43.850
<v Voiceover>It sounds like he had the strength of will</v>

296
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.567
to be able to take what life was going to hand him.

297
00:12:45.567 --> 00:12:46.570
<v ->And character.</v>

298
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.754
<v Voiceover>And character, exactly.</v>

299
00:12:47.754 --> 00:12:51.796
<v ->And to suffer the onslaughts of derision.</v>

300
00:12:51.796 --> 00:12:53.983
attacks on his character,

301
00:12:53.983 --> 00:12:55.488
21 assassination attempts.

302
00:12:55.488 --> 00:12:57.248
Attempts to kidnap his children.

303
00:12:57.248 --> 00:12:59.872
Merciless attacks, to this day, from skeptics

304
00:12:59.872 --> 00:13:03.951
who know nothing about the man, or the case, effectively.

305
00:13:03.951 --> 00:13:07.827
He obviously came for a purpose, like we all do,

306
00:13:07.827 --> 00:13:10.611
and his is, my perception, it's a gift of love.

307
00:13:10.611 --> 00:13:11.312
That's it.

308
00:13:11.312 --> 00:13:13.040
<v Voiceover>Yes, yes.</v>

309
00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.357
Well, I think at this time, so there are

310
00:13:16.357 --> 00:13:18.095
24,000 plus pages now, right?

311
00:13:18.095 --> 00:13:19.045
<v ->Mostly in German.</v>

312
00:13:19.045 --> 00:13:20.933
<v Voiceover>Mostly in German, some of them have been</v>

313
00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:22.063
translated into English.

314
00:13:22.063 --> 00:13:23.045
<v ->And other languages.</v>

315
00:13:23.045 --> 00:13:25.060
<v Voiceover>Yes, in other languages.</v>

316
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.634
So people can go on, as they become more familiar

317
00:13:28.634 --> 00:13:30.980
with this interview, if they haven't heard of Billy.

318
00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.953
They can go on the sites and we'll have all that information

319
00:13:32.953 --> 00:13:35.972
available but let's start going through

320
00:13:35.972 --> 00:13:38.649
some of the information here.

321
00:13:38.649 --> 00:13:40.803
Obviously, we're only going to be scratching the surface.

322
00:13:40.803 --> 00:13:43.011
While we're on it, let's get back to

323
00:13:43.011 --> 00:13:45.417
what you had just mentioned about

324
00:13:45.417 --> 00:13:46.580
(sighs)

325
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.809
history having played itself out and beings trying

326
00:13:48.809 --> 00:13:50.612
to assist us at this time.

327
00:13:50.612 --> 00:13:52.681
Can you give us a portrait of that?

328
00:13:52.681 --> 00:13:56.286
<v ->Sure, I'll try to condense it and say that a lot of it</v>

329
00:13:56.286 --> 00:13:58.366
you can read for free on the website

330
00:13:58.366 --> 00:14:00.371
and other places, probably now.

331
00:14:00.371 --> 00:14:02.760
Basically, what we're told in this case is that some

332
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.960
22 million years ago or more.

333
00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.256
There was a development of a race

334
00:14:09.256 --> 00:14:12.925
in the Sirian Star system, this is where our,

335
00:14:12.925 --> 00:14:17.500
many of our distant ancestors actually came into being,

336
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.548
if you will, now they're indigenous humans who have

337
00:14:19.548 --> 00:14:22.450
arisen on this planet as is customary for a planet

338
00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:25.127
in development that can support human life.

339
00:14:25.127 --> 00:14:27.335
And there were many colonizations and comings and goings

340
00:14:27.335 --> 00:14:31.484
Let's focus more events that took place thousands

341
00:14:31.484 --> 00:14:34.129
and sometimes even tens of thousands of years ago.

342
00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:37.851
When some of these more advanced beings would come

343
00:14:37.851 --> 00:14:41.915
and seeing the relatively primitive indigenous earth humans

344
00:14:41.915 --> 00:14:46.768
or those humans who where the decedents of more advanced

345
00:14:46.768 --> 00:14:50.000
humans who had degenerated the process of being separated

346
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.376
from their technology.

347
00:14:51.376 --> 00:14:53.445
<v Voiceover>This is a really important point.</v>

348
00:14:53.445 --> 00:14:54.352
<v ->Huge.</v>

349
00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:55.973
<v Voiceover>Important point.</v>

350
00:14:55.973 --> 00:14:59.802
Who had descended, the devolvement of the human species.

351
00:14:59.802 --> 00:15:01.178
<v ->The devolvement.</v>

352
00:15:01.178 --> 00:15:02.586
<v Voiceover>Devolution, yes.</v>

353
00:15:02.586 --> 00:15:05.625
<v ->And that devolution really was...</v>

354
00:15:05.625 --> 00:15:08.537
It's a perfectly logical thing, in a sense,

355
00:15:08.537 --> 00:15:10.948
that if an advanced race comes to a planet

356
00:15:10.948 --> 00:15:13.476
that is still in relatively primitive form

357
00:15:13.476 --> 00:15:16.473
you have no technology going on whatsoever

358
00:15:16.473 --> 00:15:17.614
and you have technology

359
00:15:17.614 --> 00:15:20.398
but, let's you've come in just one or two craft, even

360
00:15:20.398 --> 00:15:23.672
and you're here for a period of time and you're setting up

361
00:15:23.672 --> 00:15:25.902
your groups, your societies, what have you

362
00:15:25.902 --> 00:15:29.219
and you own technology fails you.

363
00:15:29.219 --> 00:15:31.725
Your craft can no longer get off the planet

364
00:15:31.725 --> 00:15:33.773
and this also comes into play

365
00:15:33.773 --> 00:15:36.717
for the Tunguska event in Siberia

366
00:15:36.717 --> 00:15:38.743
around 1906 which we might get to.

367
00:15:38.743 --> 00:15:40.386
<v Voiceover>We'll get to right after this.</v>

368
00:15:40.386 --> 00:15:45.218
<v ->Right, so, these people then just through the course</v>

369
00:15:45.218 --> 00:15:47.767
of survival fall into tribalism and surviving

370
00:15:47.767 --> 00:15:51.777
and eventually losing, even a touch with and memory

371
00:15:51.777 --> 00:15:53.985
of their true origins.

372
00:15:53.985 --> 00:15:55.564
And this is--

373
00:15:55.564 --> 00:15:57.836
<v Voiceover>These are our ancestors, by the way.</v>

374
00:15:57.836 --> 00:15:59.275
<v ->In some cases.</v>

375
00:15:59.275 --> 00:16:00.417
<v Voiceover>In some cases.</v>

376
00:16:00.417 --> 00:16:01.206
<v ->Not all.</v>

377
00:16:01.206 --> 00:16:02.603
<v Voiceover>They're among our ancestors.</v>

378
00:16:02.603 --> 00:16:03.670
<v ->They're among our ancestors.</v>

379
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.870
Long ago I wrote piece, there once was a came a race

380
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.003
of giants from a distant war-torn star looking

381
00:16:09.003 --> 00:16:12.075
for new worlds to conquer, etcetera, etcetera.

382
00:16:12.075 --> 00:16:14.837
And it just tells the story in kind of a little poem form.

383
00:16:14.837 --> 00:16:19.573
But what happened here was that those ancestors

384
00:16:19.573 --> 00:16:23.061
let's say of the Plejaran people who have been

385
00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:26.004
erroneously identified as, quote, unquote Pleiadians

386
00:16:26.004 --> 00:16:28.767
deliberately, in this case, for other reasons.

387
00:16:28.767 --> 00:16:31.881
The Plejarans ancestors, as well as some others,

388
00:16:31.881 --> 00:16:35.689
from other lineages of extra terrestrial humans

389
00:16:35.689 --> 00:16:38.686
representing themselves as the god, gods, lords,

390
00:16:38.686 --> 00:16:41.865
masters of humanity, as can be found

391
00:16:41.865 --> 00:16:45.161
in our various holy books from the ancient Indian books

392
00:16:45.161 --> 00:16:47.070
I guess the Mabrat and all that

393
00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.504
and the Old Testament and what have you.

394
00:16:50.504 --> 00:16:53.171
These were always highly developed technologically

395
00:16:53.171 --> 00:16:55.219
developed human beings.

396
00:16:55.219 --> 00:16:57.725
In many cases, spiritually evolved.

397
00:16:57.725 --> 00:17:00.189
In many cases, they had taken a left turn morally

398
00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:03.293
and ethically because to just have great technological

399
00:17:03.293 --> 00:17:05.693
even spiritual knowledge doesn't assure that people

400
00:17:05.693 --> 00:17:08.775
will use it, in what we would call, good or positive ways.

401
00:17:08.775 --> 00:17:09.564
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

402
00:17:09.564 --> 00:17:12.423
<v ->So some of these distant gods such as Jehovah, Kemigal,</v>

403
00:17:12.423 --> 00:17:16.689
Arros and others were lording it over various peoples

404
00:17:16.689 --> 00:17:20.198
and representing themselves as the creator of the universe

405
00:17:20.198 --> 00:17:22.876
and so these things get immortalized in holy books

406
00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:26.470
which, you know, is the only...

407
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:30.160
I like to say to my religious friends, this entire sum

408
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.440
of substance of the divine authority in any religion

409
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.565
rests on the illogical and childish premise.

410
00:17:37.565 --> 00:17:39.581
What's in this book is true because the book says it's true.

411
00:17:39.581 --> 00:17:40.349
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

412
00:17:40.349 --> 00:17:41.320
<v ->You can't put that in school.</v>

413
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.973
You can't take that into a court of law

414
00:17:42.973 --> 00:17:45.522
but we have religions which have been set in motion

415
00:17:45.522 --> 00:17:48.455
by these distant forefathers

416
00:17:48.455 --> 00:17:50.375
of numbers of extra terrestrials.

417
00:17:50.375 --> 00:17:54.119
So, they have in current time, some of them,

418
00:17:54.119 --> 00:17:56.764
a self-obligated mission to try to assist us

419
00:17:56.764 --> 00:17:59.900
to actually survive ourselves.

420
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.036
And then to continue with evolution

421
00:18:03.036 --> 00:18:05.862
which is a little different than Darwinian evolution.

422
00:18:05.862 --> 00:18:07.995
Some similarities, but not a lot.

423
00:18:07.995 --> 00:18:12.911
And in the process they've decided that each of the times

424
00:18:12.911 --> 00:18:17.911
that they have tried to work with a person as a prophet

425
00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.502
which simply means somebody who would bring forward

426
00:18:20.502 --> 00:18:24.363
eternal teachings of creation, laws of creation

427
00:18:24.363 --> 00:18:26.987
the way things are going.

428
00:18:26.987 --> 00:18:29.557
If you want to work your life positively and make it work

429
00:18:29.557 --> 00:18:33.183
here's some suggestions as the way the whole universe works

430
00:18:33.183 --> 00:18:36.575
and it's beyond just, quote, unquote, the law of attraction

431
00:18:36.575 --> 00:18:39.146
or any of the things that we embrace in new age thinking.

432
00:18:39.146 --> 00:18:41.215
It's a little more rigorous than that.

433
00:18:41.215 --> 00:18:45.567
And, indeed, if they try to bring this, each time

434
00:18:45.567 --> 00:18:49.268
because we have humans involved, as the teachers if you will

435
00:18:49.268 --> 00:18:51.753
the extra terrestrials and the prophets and whatever

436
00:18:51.753 --> 00:18:54.739
these are human beings so according to my own personal

437
00:18:54.739 --> 00:18:59.739
axiom here, wherever you've got human beings things

438
00:18:59.742 --> 00:19:01.598
can and will get really screwed up.

439
00:19:01.598 --> 00:19:02.963
<v Voiceover>And certainly distorted.</v>

440
00:19:02.963 --> 00:19:05.544
<v ->And very distorted so the distortion...</v>

441
00:19:05.544 --> 00:19:07.283
What is the distortion?

442
00:19:07.283 --> 00:19:11.880
It's religion because the teachings have, in each case,

443
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.911
been falsified, distorted, edited, redacted, amended

444
00:19:15.911 --> 00:19:19.485
to reflect the intention of those who are powerful

445
00:19:19.485 --> 00:19:21.618
and want to control human kind.

446
00:19:21.618 --> 00:19:26.618
So the most irrational, illogical and horrific things

447
00:19:26.716 --> 00:19:30.940
as well as some of the truths of spirit teaching,

448
00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.161
let's be fair, have been embodied in various religions.

449
00:19:34.161 --> 00:19:36.281
But as the Plejaran and Meier have said,

450
00:19:36.281 --> 00:19:38.910
"None of the religions are the truth."

451
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.875
And this information is usually conducted, whether

452
00:19:41.875 --> 00:19:44.637
deliberately or otherwise, by taking an element of truth

453
00:19:44.637 --> 00:19:47.144
and wrapping falsehood around it.

454
00:19:47.144 --> 00:19:48.840
<v Voiceover>Well, there's usually self-interest involved</v>

455
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.280
whether it's putting money in the coffers

456
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.095
or sheer power or expansion or whatnot.

457
00:19:53.095 --> 00:19:54.162
<v ->Any and all of the above.</v>

458
00:19:54.162 --> 00:19:59.079
What we see here is, in this case, a decision on the part

459
00:19:59.079 --> 00:20:02.343
of these extra terrestrials to not directly intercede again

460
00:20:02.343 --> 00:20:05.617
apart from some of the sightings of their own craft

461
00:20:05.617 --> 00:20:07.846
as well as the terrestrial craft that are seen.

462
00:20:07.846 --> 00:20:11.302
They are not gonna come down here and walk among us.

463
00:20:11.302 --> 00:20:14.737
They are benevolent extra terrestrials walking among us

464
00:20:14.737 --> 00:20:18.384
as some people like to portray in some fields here.

465
00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:21.894
They are not employed in underground bases.

466
00:20:21.894 --> 00:20:24.187
I mean, if you can travel through space and maybe time,

467
00:20:24.187 --> 00:20:26.533
do you really need a job working for the Pentagon?

468
00:20:26.533 --> 00:20:27.717
I don't think so.

469
00:20:27.717 --> 00:20:29.786
Logic forbid certain things.

470
00:20:29.786 --> 00:20:32.901
They haven't signed secret agreements with our government

471
00:20:32.901 --> 00:20:35.194
because if they can do all they that a space traveling,

472
00:20:35.194 --> 00:20:38.053
highly technologically advanced race, they don't need

473
00:20:38.053 --> 00:20:40.676
to have an attorney from Arcturus come down and say,

474
00:20:40.676 --> 00:20:41.839
"Well, change this."

475
00:20:41.839 --> 00:20:44.047
It's not happening that way.

476
00:20:44.047 --> 00:20:46.671
But a disinformation campaign that started

477
00:20:46.671 --> 00:20:50.084
as far back as 1915 will have people believe

478
00:20:50.084 --> 00:20:52.238
that there are evil aliens that are abducting them,

479
00:20:52.238 --> 00:20:54.606
they're having their babies and the rest of this stuff.

480
00:20:54.606 --> 00:20:59.353
When a proven contact case has at it's core,

481
00:20:59.353 --> 00:21:01.550
we're trying to assist you assist yourselves,

482
00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:03.107
we're not coming to save you,

483
00:21:03.107 --> 00:21:04.824
no one's coming to save you.

484
00:21:04.824 --> 00:21:07.331
We're not going to abduct you, implant you,

485
00:21:07.331 --> 00:21:09.336
turn your on your head, have babies with you,

486
00:21:09.336 --> 00:21:10.520
go on dates, work under a...

487
00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.933
We want you to survive yourselves

488
00:21:13.933 --> 00:21:16.226
and some of the impediments that you're implanted with,

489
00:21:16.226 --> 00:21:19.458
if you wanna use that word, more than 22 million years ago

490
00:21:19.458 --> 00:21:22.167
when your forefathers were genetically manipulated

491
00:21:22.167 --> 00:21:26.124
into having shortened lifespans of 100 years or far less,

492
00:21:26.124 --> 00:21:28.885
built-in degenerative diseases

493
00:21:28.885 --> 00:21:32.442
and highly increased aggression because your forefathers

494
00:21:32.442 --> 00:21:36.089
in many cases, were genetically engineered human race

495
00:21:36.089 --> 00:21:39.598
bred to be defenders of a hight evolved

496
00:21:39.598 --> 00:21:43.961
but somewhat distorted extra terrestrial human race

497
00:21:43.961 --> 00:21:46.958
who decided to progress only spiritually into beauty,

498
00:21:46.958 --> 00:21:50.019
spirituality and opulence took out their own fighting spirit

499
00:21:50.019 --> 00:21:54.499
became the easy marks of a aggressive space traveling races

500
00:21:54.499 --> 00:21:57.027
and hence, while they set about correct

501
00:21:57.027 --> 00:22:01.869
their own genetic errors, they quickly had to bring a race

502
00:22:01.869 --> 00:22:04.781
of beings forward, who would be willing fighters

503
00:22:04.781 --> 00:22:07.202
and defenders but couldn't live long enough to overthrow

504
00:22:07.202 --> 00:22:10.871
their overlords and this is part of the saga that's told

505
00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:14.103
in, for free, in the Meier case information.

506
00:22:14.103 --> 00:22:16.652
And if you think Star Wars is a great story,

507
00:22:16.652 --> 00:22:17.823
you ain't seen nothing yet.

508
00:22:17.823 --> 00:22:19.913
<v Voiceover>Yes, yes, absolutely.</v>

509
00:22:19.913 --> 00:22:23.913
I think people that are interested need to read that

510
00:22:23.913 --> 00:22:26.089
because we could talk for days just about this

511
00:22:26.089 --> 00:22:27.209
one particular area.

512
00:22:27.209 --> 00:22:31.315
Just the subject you brought up, it really begs follow-up

513
00:22:31.315 --> 00:22:34.089
because there is so much on this subject.

514
00:22:34.089 --> 00:22:36.851
Let's just start with Dr. John Mack's work, for one.

515
00:22:36.851 --> 00:22:39.123
Out of Harvard, right?

516
00:22:39.123 --> 00:22:40.541
Head of clinical psychology there.

517
00:22:40.541 --> 00:22:44.669
Who was kind of coerced into dealing with this phenomenon

518
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:45.576
known as abduction.

519
00:22:45.576 --> 00:22:48.850
Now, to the people who have experienced this, it's very real

520
00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:53.259
To the people who experienced seems like there

521
00:22:53.259 --> 00:22:55.623
are a lot of commonalities.

522
00:22:55.623 --> 00:23:00.389
But with the technology that we have, we possess

523
00:23:01.504 --> 00:23:05.450
as in our black budgets, military, have back engineered,

524
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:06.890
if you wanna call it that.

525
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.333
Back engineered and created both.

526
00:23:09.333 --> 00:23:11.530
All of these things are all so very possible

527
00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:13.343
from within the human species.

528
00:23:13.343 --> 00:23:16.127
And now it's getting very muddled and confusing

529
00:23:16.127 --> 00:23:19.540
as to what is genuinely an other worldly type of experience

530
00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.078
and what is human perpetuated experience, right?

531
00:23:22.078 --> 00:23:23.070
I mean, is that fair enough to say?

532
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.702
<v ->Well, I can give you what, I understand,</v>

533
00:23:24.702 --> 00:23:26.117
the Meier Plejaran position to be.

534
00:23:26.117 --> 00:23:27.056
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

535
00:23:27.056 --> 00:23:31.631
<v ->Since they claim that actual UFO cover-up started in 1915</v>

536
00:23:31.631 --> 00:23:33.231
<v Voiceover>And that's where we're talking about,</v>

537
00:23:33.231 --> 00:23:35.375
theoretically, the Siberian event.

538
00:23:35.375 --> 00:23:36.186
Let's talk about that.

539
00:23:36.186 --> 00:23:36.996
<v ->Okay.</v>

540
00:23:36.996 --> 00:23:38.339
<v Voiceover>No, that was different, go ahead.</v>

541
00:23:38.339 --> 00:23:39.454
<v ->It is different.</v>

542
00:23:39.454 --> 00:23:40.819
Let me just tell this one.

543
00:23:40.819 --> 00:23:44.787
They claim that the actual UFO cover-up started in 1915

544
00:23:44.787 --> 00:23:47.358
when these objects were seen over the battlefields of Europe

545
00:23:47.358 --> 00:23:50.077
and, at first, presumed by each side to be the creations

546
00:23:50.077 --> 00:23:53.437
of the weaponry of the other, however, logically after time

547
00:23:53.437 --> 00:23:55.528
nobody was attacked by any of these things

548
00:23:55.528 --> 00:23:57.928
they've all figured out, this isn't from this world

549
00:23:57.928 --> 00:24:02.311
and the conspiracy of silence was tacitly agreed upon

550
00:24:02.311 --> 00:24:05.542
because everybody recognized that to reveal that there were

551
00:24:05.542 --> 00:24:09.329
beings here over whom there was no control, on any level,

552
00:24:09.329 --> 00:24:12.326
would destabilize everything and everybody's vested interest

553
00:24:12.326 --> 00:24:15.003
So we'll fight it out amongst ourselves but we're not gonna

554
00:24:15.003 --> 00:24:16.134
talk about this.

555
00:24:16.134 --> 00:24:18.534
It took on more dimension as it was carried

556
00:24:18.534 --> 00:24:20.507
through each of the American administrations,

557
00:24:20.507 --> 00:24:21.733
who were informed about this.

558
00:24:21.733 --> 00:24:24.709
They basically kept this cover-up in tact until we get

559
00:24:24.709 --> 00:24:27.770
to the Roosevelt administration when they deliberately,

560
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.810
using intelligence operative, coerce H.G. Wells

561
00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:34.917
and Orson Welles to do the war of the worlds radio broadcast

562
00:24:34.917 --> 00:24:38.874
to create the little monsters from Mars agenda.

563
00:24:38.874 --> 00:24:42.004
Both of the respective Wells', is spelled differently,

564
00:24:42.004 --> 00:24:45.346
they and their families were threatened with death

565
00:24:45.346 --> 00:24:47.831
if anything was ever revealed by them at all

566
00:24:47.831 --> 00:24:50.241
about the agenda here.

567
00:24:50.241 --> 00:24:54.411
So this negative E.T. agenda is passed on now

568
00:24:56.444 --> 00:25:00.881
for nearly 100 years and in the process other parts

569
00:25:00.881 --> 00:25:04.945
of the media, either knowingly or, often times, unknowingly

570
00:25:04.945 --> 00:25:09.734
forward this evil alien, big jaws and teeth and creature

571
00:25:09.734 --> 00:25:14.734
kind of a model archetype and people take that up,

572
00:25:14.779 --> 00:25:17.285
in what I call, subnoxious minds.

573
00:25:17.285 --> 00:25:19.771
And they start imagining all sorts of things going on

574
00:25:19.771 --> 00:25:20.720
that aren't going on.

575
00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.848
Now, to go to the Meier Plejaran perspective,

576
00:25:24.848 --> 00:25:27.399
yes, there have probably been some, what they would call,

577
00:25:27.399 --> 00:25:30.243
contact examinations conducted by some curious,

578
00:25:30.243 --> 00:25:32.569
scientific types and, if you think about logically,

579
00:25:32.569 --> 00:25:36.024
if the memories were blocked, we can just call it,

580
00:25:36.024 --> 00:25:40.248
if not benevolent, neutral impact intention so that people

581
00:25:40.248 --> 00:25:42.019
wouldn't know this had happened to them.

582
00:25:42.019 --> 00:25:46.669
However, what they say without a doubt is that the majority

583
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:50.169
of, what we call, human abductions, cattle mutilations

584
00:25:50.169 --> 00:25:52.533
and human mutilations, if and when they occur

585
00:25:52.533 --> 00:25:55.669
without any evidence are primarily secret military

586
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:57.642
and CIA and that type of thing.

587
00:25:57.642 --> 00:26:02.642
The rest of it, sleep paralysis, mass hysteria, laybial mind

588
00:26:03.189 --> 00:26:06.207
schizophrenia, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

589
00:26:06.207 --> 00:26:08.436
Now that doesn't mean it's the truth, it simply means

590
00:26:08.436 --> 00:26:10.602
this is the perspective they've put forward.

591
00:26:10.602 --> 00:26:14.548
But one thinks logically, based on all these studies

592
00:26:14.548 --> 00:26:17.129
about alien abductions and all the claims,

593
00:26:17.129 --> 00:26:19.892
you would have a line of ships, lined up from here

594
00:26:19.892 --> 00:26:23.721
to gosh knows where with aliens just can't wait to come here

595
00:26:23.721 --> 00:26:27.017
and intermingle with us and sample our genetics,

596
00:26:27.017 --> 00:26:32.017
our corrupted, aggressive, short-lived, disease-ridden,

597
00:26:34.858 --> 00:26:37.268
fear laden genetics.

598
00:26:37.268 --> 00:26:39.593
If they are space travelers, they've already extended

599
00:26:39.593 --> 00:26:42.452
their lifespans through the process of slow evolution

600
00:26:42.452 --> 00:26:46.281
of having to have long life spans to begin the journeys

601
00:26:46.281 --> 00:26:48.436
into space which for many races might have taken place

602
00:26:48.436 --> 00:26:51.059
thousands, tens, hundreds of thousands or millions

603
00:26:51.059 --> 00:26:52.222
of years ago.

604
00:26:52.222 --> 00:26:54.590
So can expect for them to have, at least, multi-hundred year

605
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:56.723
lifespans, they don't need our genetics.

606
00:26:56.723 --> 00:26:59.443
Our emotions, greed, anger, fear, envy, war,

607
00:26:59.443 --> 00:27:02.461
lusts of all sorts and perversions.

608
00:27:02.461 --> 00:27:05.010
I don't think anybody needs that one either.

609
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:07.709
So, if you just start to approach it logically

610
00:27:07.709 --> 00:27:10.685
and look then at the disinformation value,

611
00:27:10.685 --> 00:27:12.839
you can also see that many of the sightings

612
00:27:12.839 --> 00:27:16.882
which have seemingly increasing, not far from military bases

613
00:27:16.882 --> 00:27:20.732
often as it happens and of course, with vague evidence.

614
00:27:20.732 --> 00:27:22.961
I mean lights in the sky are some objects when we see it.

615
00:27:22.961 --> 00:27:26.748
Virtually, nothing else, no content of any usefulness.

616
00:27:26.748 --> 00:27:29.809
So, the agenda that Meier was talking about years ago

617
00:27:29.809 --> 00:27:31.675
about a created U.S.,

618
00:27:31.675 --> 00:27:35.686
U. S. military created a fake E.T. attack in order

619
00:27:35.686 --> 00:27:39.878
to bring people under martial law and control.

620
00:27:39.878 --> 00:27:43.984
Let's remember that 1958, Meier wrote about the coming

621
00:27:43.984 --> 00:27:46.811
biochipping danger, first the U.S.

622
00:27:46.811 --> 00:27:49.904
and then the European Union which he refers

623
00:27:49.904 --> 00:27:53.829
to as a dictatorship coming as far back as the 50's.

624
00:27:53.829 --> 00:27:58.107
So when people read this, the hairs, if they go up.

625
00:27:58.107 --> 00:27:59.375
<v Voiceover>I know, when you were saying that</v>

626
00:27:59.375 --> 00:28:01.209
the hairs are going up and I've heard all this

627
00:28:01.209 --> 00:28:02.628
and it's still goes up.

628
00:28:02.628 --> 00:28:05.156
<v ->Well, the man published it 50 years ago.</v>

629
00:28:05.156 --> 00:28:06.629
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

630
00:28:06.629 --> 00:28:08.569
<v ->Along with two U.S. Iraq wars, AIDS, computers,</v>

631
00:28:08.569 --> 00:28:11.389
the internet, etcetera, etcetera.

632
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:15.282
People we're being given something for free.

633
00:28:15.282 --> 00:28:16.402
For a reason.

634
00:28:16.402 --> 00:28:18.673
<v Voiceover>Let's take a little--</v>

635
00:28:18.673 --> 00:28:21.063
<v ->I'm sorry, did you want that 1906 event?</v>

636
00:28:21.063 --> 00:28:22.140
<v Voiceover>Yes, 1906 too.</v>

637
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.388
<v ->This is pretty far-out stuff.</v>

638
00:28:23.388 --> 00:28:25.553
Again, it's just information of the case.

639
00:28:25.553 --> 00:28:28.262
I'm a reporter, I have my own opinions about some things

640
00:28:28.262 --> 00:28:29.819
where I agree or disagree.

641
00:28:29.819 --> 00:28:31.633
<v Voiceover>And feel free to state them, it's fine.</v>

642
00:28:31.633 --> 00:28:33.307
<v ->Yeah, I will, if you want.</v>

643
00:28:33.307 --> 00:28:35.248
Let me give you this one which I don't...

644
00:28:35.248 --> 00:28:37.179
I say about a lot so stuff that I call it simply,

645
00:28:37.179 --> 00:28:39.525
speculative because I can not prove it or disprove it.

646
00:28:39.525 --> 00:28:40.784
No one else can.

647
00:28:40.784 --> 00:28:43.269
To this point, now maybe by the time somebody's watching

648
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:44.869
this interview, you have proof one way

649
00:28:44.869 --> 00:28:46.309
or the other of things.

650
00:28:46.309 --> 00:28:50.815
The story is this, there is the Tunguska crater in Siberia.

651
00:28:50.815 --> 00:28:54.462
Where there is this huge area where trees were all flattened

652
00:28:54.462 --> 00:28:58.324
and a big hole in the ground, remnants anyhow of some form

653
00:28:58.324 --> 00:29:01.203
of what people thought was a meteor strike.

654
00:29:01.203 --> 00:29:04.009
No meteor there but they figured it was a big meteor strike.

655
00:29:04.009 --> 00:29:06.003
Information that Meier case is this

656
00:29:06.003 --> 00:29:09.374
and it's pretty mind-boggling on many levels.

657
00:29:09.374 --> 00:29:13.395
There had been a group of people who had come here

658
00:29:13.395 --> 00:29:17.341
some time ago who had become involved

659
00:29:17.341 --> 00:29:20.178
in studying Christianity, they'd found this religion.

660
00:29:20.178 --> 00:29:21.938
These were people who were otherwise living

661
00:29:21.938 --> 00:29:25.234
by what they call, natural and creational law

662
00:29:25.234 --> 00:29:28.231
who didn't have gods and all the rest but got involoved

663
00:29:28.231 --> 00:29:30.930
in studying all this Christianity where, apparently,

664
00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:33.255
the creation in the form of deity had given

665
00:29:33.255 --> 00:29:36.732
his only begotten son who, of course, has to get nailed up

666
00:29:36.732 --> 00:29:38.844
in some blood thirsty manner

667
00:29:38.844 --> 00:29:41.500
in order to validate the premise and they took this back

668
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.769
to their own worlds.

669
00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:44.283
<v Voiceover>So you're talking off-planet people?</v>

670
00:29:44.283 --> 00:29:47.025
<v ->People who came here and were studying humanity,</v>

671
00:29:47.025 --> 00:29:49.552
not necessarily interacting but studying humanity.

672
00:29:49.552 --> 00:29:52.667
Well, they took Christianity back to their worlds

673
00:29:52.667 --> 00:29:55.472
which were in the constellation, I think, of Virgo

674
00:29:55.472 --> 00:29:59.077
the coma, C-O-M-A system where there are inhabited worlds.

675
00:29:59.077 --> 00:30:02.629
And ultimately, the outcome of it was wars

676
00:30:02.629 --> 00:30:05.669
that were devastating to three planets.

677
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:08.922
Until other forces stepped in.

678
00:30:08.922 --> 00:30:11.375
And kind of an edict was enforced

679
00:30:11.375 --> 00:30:14.585
that any E.T.'s that were going to come and look in here

680
00:30:14.585 --> 00:30:18.596
and study, were not to involve themselves with our religions

681
00:30:18.596 --> 00:30:21.966
at all and also that any E.T.'s that got stranded here

682
00:30:21.966 --> 00:30:25.870
through their own devices with only certain exceptions

683
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:30.732
who could not make communication back to their worlds

684
00:30:30.732 --> 00:30:35.589
to assist them would have to remain here.

685
00:30:35.589 --> 00:30:39.301
And effectively they'd have to die on this planet.

686
00:30:39.301 --> 00:30:42.991
A group of 4300 such people from this system,

687
00:30:42.991 --> 00:30:45.252
who are described in the Meier material as somewhat

688
00:30:45.252 --> 00:30:49.284
mongoloid looking with a roughish, yellowish skin,

689
00:30:49.284 --> 00:30:52.537
mongoloid features, which would fit in somewhat as well,

690
00:30:52.537 --> 00:30:53.583
in Siberia, yeah.

691
00:30:53.583 --> 00:30:56.206
Which may be part of the reason why they're all still there.

692
00:30:56.206 --> 00:30:58.766
Found themselves, you know, they came down, they put

693
00:30:58.766 --> 00:31:01.383
their craft in a remote area where no one would find them.

694
00:31:01.383 --> 00:31:04.285
At a certain point, I'm not sure how long they'd been here,

695
00:31:04.285 --> 00:31:06.631
they decided to intermingle a bit with the populous

696
00:31:06.631 --> 00:31:08.188
for fun and games.

697
00:31:08.188 --> 00:31:12.017
The result of which was that they cam back to the ships

698
00:31:12.017 --> 00:31:16.608
with syphilis and it spread through their own community,

699
00:31:18.097 --> 00:31:19.046
if you will.

700
00:31:19.046 --> 00:31:22.058
They had no natural defense for this.

701
00:31:22.058 --> 00:31:26.047
Apparently, it was taking hold, faster than they could do

702
00:31:26.047 --> 00:31:28.628
anything about it and they realized

703
00:31:28.628 --> 00:31:30.783
that they were basically doomed.

704
00:31:30.783 --> 00:31:34.761
They found that their own craft had technological problems

705
00:31:34.761 --> 00:31:37.683
and they couldn't leave the planet so, here they are

706
00:31:37.683 --> 00:31:41.097
in this double bind and what they did was, they fashioned

707
00:31:41.097 --> 00:31:43.166
a device, an atomic device, you might say.

708
00:31:43.166 --> 00:31:47.447
And, in keeping with this particular edict, at one point

709
00:31:47.447 --> 00:31:50.657
they simply brought their ship up as high as they could

710
00:31:50.657 --> 00:31:52.833
above the earth and as they dropped it,

711
00:31:52.833 --> 00:31:56.315
they detonated the atomic explosive device.

712
00:31:57.484 --> 00:32:00.897
And they committed mass suicide rather than

713
00:32:00.897 --> 00:32:05.061
be discovered here and rather than go through anymore.

714
00:32:06.688 --> 00:32:08.309
<v Voiceover>Let's, I wanna, okay...</v>

715
00:32:08.309 --> 00:32:11.679
Let's go back toward where we were a moment ago, where

716
00:32:11.679 --> 00:32:12.469
(clears throat)

717
00:32:12.469 --> 00:32:16.340
we were talking about intervention from the other side

718
00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:19.370
and people who have a remembrance of, what they call,

719
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:22.761
abductions and being, samples drawn whatnot.

720
00:32:22.761 --> 00:32:27.704
That had become part of the larger abductee conversation.

721
00:32:29.278 --> 00:32:32.361
And earlier you said that the point is

722
00:32:32.361 --> 00:32:34.078
to help us save ourselves.

723
00:32:34.078 --> 00:32:36.425
To your knowledge, has there been any of that

724
00:32:36.425 --> 00:32:38.654
that has occurred that's genuine?

725
00:32:38.654 --> 00:32:41.000
Or some genuine testing, for example, has happened

726
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.019
that might be actually toward that end?

727
00:32:44.019 --> 00:32:47.332
<v ->Do you mean abduction for the sake of genetic things?</v>

728
00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:49.309
For our benefit?

729
00:32:49.309 --> 00:32:50.362
<v Voiceover>Well, whether you call it abduction</v>

730
00:32:50.362 --> 00:32:52.080
or whatever you wanna call it.

731
00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.373
The exact scenario, there are many words you can put to it.

732
00:32:54.373 --> 00:32:57.867
Someone, without their knowledge, having been worked on.

733
00:32:57.867 --> 00:33:01.236
Their memory erased.
<v ->Well, as I said--</v>

734
00:33:01.256 --> 00:33:03.463
Is there any of that that's happened maybe toward the end

735
00:33:03.463 --> 00:33:06.684
of our actually saving ourselves and every species

736
00:33:06.684 --> 00:33:09.315
on the planet, not just us but our plants, our fauna?

737
00:33:09.315 --> 00:33:11.162
<v ->I think that's a different question but let's link them</v>

738
00:33:11.162 --> 00:33:12.204
together a little bit.

739
00:33:12.204 --> 00:33:13.553
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

740
00:33:13.553 --> 00:33:15.152
<v ->As I say, my understanding is that there had been</v>

741
00:33:15.152 --> 00:33:16.803
some genuine contact examinations.

742
00:33:16.803 --> 00:33:17.342
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

743
00:33:17.342 --> 00:33:19.827
<v ->By some curious space travelers, scientifically,</v>

744
00:33:19.827 --> 00:33:21.842
what is this about, we've got one of these here.

745
00:33:21.842 --> 00:33:22.437
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

746
00:33:22.437 --> 00:33:23.407
<v ->That's us.</v>

747
00:33:23.407 --> 00:33:27.962
And then jump to thing about the animals

748
00:33:27.962 --> 00:33:28.847
and the other creatures.

749
00:33:28.847 --> 00:33:32.951
My own thinking is that they have sampled everything

750
00:33:32.951 --> 00:33:35.948
that might need to be possibly even--

751
00:33:35.948 --> 00:33:37.676
<v Voiceover>Preserved.</v>
<v ->Reintroduced.</v>

752
00:33:37.676 --> 00:33:38.668
<v Voiceover>That's what I'm asking.</v>

753
00:33:38.668 --> 00:33:39.746
<v ->Possibly so.</v>

754
00:33:39.746 --> 00:33:41.132
<v Voiceover>Yes, I believe that might be the case.</v>

755
00:33:41.132 --> 00:33:43.831
<v ->I think it could be the case as a service to nature itself</v>

756
00:33:43.831 --> 00:33:44.844
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

757
00:33:44.844 --> 00:33:46.849
<v ->Now there will be, in the course of time,</v>

758
00:33:46.849 --> 00:33:49.697
natural evolutions of species anyhow that are on the planet

759
00:33:49.697 --> 00:33:52.065
when ice ages occur and different things like that.

760
00:33:52.065 --> 00:33:54.998
Then coming to the idea of any contemporary sampling

761
00:33:54.998 --> 00:33:58.528
of humans, I don't think at all because, first of all,

762
00:33:58.528 --> 00:34:02.731
again, this is only living 70 to 100 years, if you're lucky.

763
00:34:02.731 --> 00:34:04.565
Or unlucky, as the case may be.

764
00:34:04.565 --> 00:34:08.715
And they are already, the Plejaran, for instance,

765
00:34:08.715 --> 00:34:11.285
are claiming to have 900 to 1500 year lifespans.

766
00:34:11.285 --> 00:34:12.192
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

767
00:34:12.192 --> 00:34:13.344
<v ->They don't need this.</v>

768
00:34:13.344 --> 00:34:17.621
We are in a sense, I think, protected from being able

769
00:34:17.621 --> 00:34:20.906
to truly look in on other, more advanced, civilizations.

770
00:34:20.906 --> 00:34:22.826
'Cause I think we would be depressed.

771
00:34:22.826 --> 00:34:27.007
If we could actually tune in to other civilizations

772
00:34:27.007 --> 00:34:29.428
who are living in a place where they're not looking

773
00:34:29.428 --> 00:34:31.337
over their shoulder at each other.

774
00:34:31.337 --> 00:34:33.886
Where there is love, harmony, respect, living

775
00:34:33.886 --> 00:34:37.470
in accordance with creational, natural law.

776
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:39.689
I'm not talking about angels, and fluttery, imaginary

777
00:34:39.689 --> 00:34:42.920
as a light being, I'm talking about humans.

778
00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:46.429
We would go, what have done for the last 10,000 years

779
00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:47.379
to ourselves.

780
00:34:47.379 --> 00:34:49.235
Why are we trying to climb over each other

781
00:34:49.235 --> 00:34:52.530
for an extracting the last ounce of petroleum

782
00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:54.482
and pieces of green paper.

783
00:34:54.482 --> 00:34:59.058
People, it would be very destructive to us at this point.

784
00:34:59.058 --> 00:35:00.999
We have to work our way towards that.

785
00:35:00.999 --> 00:35:02.759
<v Voiceover>And,</v>

786
00:35:02.759 --> 00:35:03.431
(clears throat)

787
00:35:03.431 --> 00:35:05.852
not to derail the conversation or sidetrack it too much.

788
00:35:05.852 --> 00:35:08.583
But there's a lot of thought and a lot of writing

789
00:35:08.583 --> 00:35:12.508
on the notion that, this goes far beyond just tens

790
00:35:12.508 --> 00:35:15.505
of thousands of years, we actually were that

791
00:35:15.505 --> 00:35:18.683
toward the beginning of our incarnation paths.

792
00:35:18.683 --> 00:35:21.563
The earliest civilizations did live many of hundreds

793
00:35:21.563 --> 00:35:24.635
of years when we were still in a more original, advanced

794
00:35:24.635 --> 00:35:27.536
form before the devolution repeatedly kept occurring.

795
00:35:27.536 --> 00:35:30.979
<v ->Well, wait, the devolution didn't repeatedly occur.</v>

796
00:35:30.979 --> 00:35:34.145
In other words, my understanding is, yes, there are more

797
00:35:34.145 --> 00:35:36.609
advanced races that came, some went.

798
00:35:36.609 --> 00:35:37.654
So didn't suffer that.

799
00:35:37.654 --> 00:35:38.347
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

800
00:35:38.347 --> 00:35:40.278
Some actually were wiped out over time.

801
00:35:40.278 --> 00:35:41.131
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

802
00:35:41.131 --> 00:35:43.126
<v ->Others devolved into more primitive forms</v>

803
00:35:43.126 --> 00:35:45.270
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>
through survival.

804
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:49.259
<v ->But many indigenous humans, in the mass of humanity</v>

805
00:35:49.259 --> 00:35:52.235
has been on an upward evolutionary spiral

806
00:35:52.235 --> 00:35:56.128
with the inherited genetic manipulations to limit us.

807
00:35:56.128 --> 00:35:58.922
But we are evolving, there is no fall.

808
00:35:58.922 --> 00:36:02.474
The original sin was that which was done to the humans

809
00:36:02.474 --> 00:36:04.650
through the genetic manipulations on us.

810
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:05.471
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

811
00:36:05.471 --> 00:36:07.114
<v ->It wasn't some fall because we came here</v>

812
00:36:07.114 --> 00:36:09.161
as spiritual beings, we are spiritual beings

813
00:36:09.161 --> 00:36:12.777
but the spirit comes in unknowing and is evolving up.

814
00:36:12.777 --> 00:36:16.329
<v Voiceover>Okay, yes, I'm referring to other path.</v>

815
00:36:16.329 --> 00:36:18.217
The ones who came from other places

816
00:36:18.217 --> 00:36:20.051
who actually got stuck here, so to speak,

817
00:36:20.051 --> 00:36:22.110
and then the damage started occurring.

818
00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:26.073
<v ->They had to go through the same evolutionary path</v>

819
00:36:26.073 --> 00:36:26.926
in their home worlds.

820
00:36:26.926 --> 00:36:28.050
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

821
00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:28.915
<v ->Then they came to this higher place.</v>

822
00:36:28.915 --> 00:36:32.520
So considering that evolution for the human being

823
00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.253
wherever it is found ubiquitously throughout the universe.

824
00:36:36.253 --> 00:36:40.382
Takes place over billions of years and millions of lifetimes

825
00:36:40.382 --> 00:36:43.579
You may have quite a roller coaster, we may evolve,

826
00:36:43.579 --> 00:36:45.904
become space travelers and all of a sudden, we may then

827
00:36:45.904 --> 00:36:47.994
start looking into other beings, we may become stranded,

828
00:36:47.994 --> 00:36:49.456
have to go through evolution.

829
00:36:49.456 --> 00:36:50.501
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

830
00:36:50.501 --> 00:36:53.541
And that's well put, just to show the cycle of the nature

831
00:36:53.541 --> 00:36:54.767
of a being.

832
00:36:54.767 --> 00:36:56.229
(laughs)
<v ->The nature of living.</v>

833
00:36:56.229 --> 00:36:59.130
Before we even can come to the level of the beings

834
00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:03.225
in the Andromeda galaxy, half-physical, half-immaterial

835
00:37:03.225 --> 00:37:07.140
before they evolved to the lowest levels

836
00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.956
of spiritual evolution.

837
00:37:09.956 --> 00:37:11.001
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

838
00:37:11.001 --> 00:37:15.694
<v ->We really are in kindergarten on this spec of cosmic lint.</v>

839
00:37:15.694 --> 00:37:18.062
<v Voiceover>Yes, I would say where we are now.</v>

840
00:37:18.062 --> 00:37:20.451
That is definitely true and let's talk about some of that.

841
00:37:20.451 --> 00:37:22.616
According to Billy Meier's work there's what,

842
00:37:22.616 --> 00:37:27.587
something like 42 million other human civilizations?

843
00:37:27.587 --> 00:37:30.274
<v ->That the Plejaran, for sure, know about but they've</v>

844
00:37:30.274 --> 00:37:32.717
also said that there are literally billions.

845
00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:33.976
<v Voiceover>Billions of other humans?</v>

846
00:37:33.976 --> 00:37:35.042
Yes.

847
00:37:35.042 --> 00:37:37.271
<v ->This universe being one of billions.</v>

848
00:37:37.271 --> 00:37:38.871
<v Voiceover>Many, many, universes, yes.</v>

849
00:37:38.871 --> 00:37:40.823
<v ->It's a young universe.</v>

850
00:37:40.823 --> 00:37:42.636
It's not the original universe.

851
00:37:42.636 --> 00:37:46.625
Even the wisest of the wise, in this universe don't have

852
00:37:46.625 --> 00:37:49.804
all the answers to all of life's truly important questions.

853
00:37:49.804 --> 00:37:51.777
<v Voiceover>And that makes it much more rich</v>

854
00:37:51.777 --> 00:37:54.124
and complex and ongoing a journey when you look

855
00:37:54.124 --> 00:37:58.497
at the vastness of the potential for our own species

856
00:37:58.497 --> 00:38:00.609
and every other species development.

857
00:38:00.609 --> 00:38:02.166
I mean the depth just goes on and on.

858
00:38:02.166 --> 00:38:05.111
It starts giving a little more weight to the notion

859
00:38:05.111 --> 00:38:06.434
of infinity.

860
00:38:06.434 --> 00:38:07.693
(laughs)

861
00:38:07.693 --> 00:38:09.687
<v ->And begs the question of what is the void.</v>

862
00:38:09.687 --> 00:38:12.119
<v Voiceover>And what is the void in that scenario?</v>

863
00:38:12.119 --> 00:38:14.540
<v ->In which that great nothingness of...</v>

864
00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.695
<v Voiceover>This brings me to the next question.</v>

865
00:38:16.695 --> 00:38:20.723
On this planet, there's creation

866
00:38:21.401 --> 00:38:24.772
and god that seems to be

867
00:38:24.772 --> 00:38:28.142
in virtually every religion intertwined

868
00:38:28.142 --> 00:38:29.846
so almost inseparable.

869
00:38:29.846 --> 00:38:31.979
God is creation and so forth.

870
00:38:31.979 --> 00:38:34.774
Now, let's talk about that whole notion.

871
00:38:34.774 --> 00:38:36.139
<v ->Let's make a distinction.</v>

872
00:38:36.139 --> 00:38:37.109
<v Voiceover>Separation of creation and god.</v>

873
00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:39.040
<v ->Church and state.</v>

874
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.890
Yes, well, I was saying, in reference to the position

875
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:44.960
expressed in the Meier material.

876
00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:49.960
The gods of the past as referred to in most of the,

877
00:38:50.216 --> 00:38:53.906
in all of the major religions and many of the non-major

878
00:38:53.906 --> 00:38:56.882
religions with the exception of the very pagan spirit

879
00:38:56.882 --> 00:39:00.892
nature spirit type of things which are small levels.

880
00:39:00.892 --> 00:39:03.911
We're advanced human beings who came here

881
00:39:03.911 --> 00:39:08.401
from the depths of space, the depths of outer space.

882
00:39:08.401 --> 00:39:11.324
They were human meaning they were fallible

883
00:39:11.324 --> 00:39:14.299
as we are the recipients of, in many cases,

884
00:39:14.299 --> 00:39:16.987
their fallibility but we're responsible nonetheless.

885
00:39:16.987 --> 00:39:20.891
The creation is said to be, in effect, this universe

886
00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:25.232
is a consciousness, it is also a structure but it is

887
00:39:25.232 --> 00:39:30.232
that which birthed itself from the nothingness, in effect

888
00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:34.437
or from the original absolute absolutum creation

889
00:39:34.437 --> 00:39:38.959
and in a big bang form, suddenly, without warning

890
00:39:38.959 --> 00:39:42.255
love became itself with a pucker and a pop

891
00:39:42.255 --> 00:39:44.143
and love looked around and saw the great void,

892
00:39:44.143 --> 00:39:47.268
the empty emptiness, decided to let there be light

893
00:39:47.268 --> 00:39:49.785
through the switch and spewed forth great, you know,

894
00:39:49.785 --> 00:39:52.494
gaseous clouds and all the rest of this stuff

895
00:39:52.494 --> 00:39:55.214
and, in time, the universe itself had come into being

896
00:39:55.214 --> 00:39:57.187
and said wow, which came back upside-down a

897
00:39:57.187 --> 00:39:58.905
and said Mom which was the great nature.

898
00:39:58.905 --> 00:40:00.579
You have the mom and pop of creation.

899
00:40:00.579 --> 00:40:02.136
Well, we can make the creation story go

900
00:40:02.136 --> 00:40:03.246
in many different ways.

901
00:40:03.246 --> 00:40:04.920
The fact that of the matter is, nothing exists

902
00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:08.931
in this universe but that which has been created, in effect,

903
00:40:08.931 --> 00:40:12.397
or given creational impetus by the creation.

904
00:40:12.397 --> 00:40:16.183
We all exist within the creation and the creation exists

905
00:40:16.183 --> 00:40:20.077
within everything but uniquely, in the human being,

906
00:40:20.077 --> 00:40:23.266
you might call it a hologram of the creation itself

907
00:40:23.266 --> 00:40:26.306
exists in the form of the human spirit.

908
00:40:26.306 --> 00:40:30.369
Not the soul which is primarily located

909
00:40:30.369 --> 00:40:35.340
in the solar-plexus as a temporal transitory gestalt.

910
00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:38.241
But the spirit is that immortal, eternal part

911
00:40:38.241 --> 00:40:41.558
of each human being, personality-less

912
00:40:41.558 --> 00:40:46.486
that exists deep within the brain and goes

913
00:40:46.486 --> 00:40:49.205
from incarnation to incarnation calling forth

914
00:40:49.205 --> 00:40:54.080
a new personality in each lifetime, this sex or that one,

915
00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.117
this race or that one, what have you.

916
00:40:56.117 --> 00:40:58.073
For the most part, most people,

917
00:40:58.073 --> 00:41:01.284
some present company excluded, have no recollection

918
00:41:01.284 --> 00:41:05.454
of past incarnations and there's a logic to that

919
00:41:05.454 --> 00:41:07.129
that we could examine in many ways.

920
00:41:07.129 --> 00:41:11.800
But briefly, in our past lifetimes, we have been not only

921
00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.285
murderers and unpleasant people,

922
00:41:14.285 --> 00:41:17.421
we've been the victims, things this people can figure out.

923
00:41:17.421 --> 00:41:19.202
However, we've been something else.

924
00:41:19.202 --> 00:41:20.920
We've been madly in love with people.

925
00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.128
We've married, we've been husbands and wives and children

926
00:41:23.128 --> 00:41:25.869
and to dwell, to tap into the emotion, the positive

927
00:41:25.869 --> 00:41:29.484
of any lifetime could be overwhelming and take...

928
00:41:29.484 --> 00:41:32.599
we only live a few decades here, relatively.

929
00:41:32.599 --> 00:41:35.020
So too many new agers don't really live this life

930
00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.356
because they're so busy doing past life regression

931
00:41:37.356 --> 00:41:39.543
or past life depression as the case may be.

932
00:41:39.543 --> 00:41:42.422
It's blow by them, before they're done with it.

933
00:41:42.422 --> 00:41:45.068
There, of course, people that have spontaneous recollections

934
00:41:45.068 --> 00:41:47.275
in different things and some of it can be validated,

935
00:41:47.275 --> 00:41:48.278
what have you.

936
00:41:48.278 --> 00:41:50.848
For the most part, for the masses, until...

937
00:41:50.848 --> 00:41:53.590
not until, we are much farther down the road of evolution

938
00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:56.704
will we have this accessible to us.

939
00:41:56.704 --> 00:41:59.232
Even the Plejaran just don't have all that access,

940
00:41:59.232 --> 00:42:00.021
for the most part.

941
00:42:00.021 --> 00:42:01.738
<v Voiceover>What's interesting in that, is that we do</v>

942
00:42:01.738 --> 00:42:04.970
have it all unconsciously and it's all driven through

943
00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:08.821
our various behaviors from, what we call, a subconscious.

944
00:42:08.821 --> 00:42:12.468
I mean, information that is carried forth in the auric field

945
00:42:12.468 --> 00:42:15.540
for example, you still have all the damage and all the love

946
00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:17.119
and all the attraction and repulsion with you,

947
00:42:17.119 --> 00:42:18.953
you just don't know why.

948
00:42:18.953 --> 00:42:19.945
(laughs)

949
00:42:19.945 --> 00:42:21.183
Which makes it even more interesting.

950
00:42:21.183 --> 00:42:22.409
<v ->Could be.</v>

951
00:42:22.409 --> 00:42:24.201
There's another thing that they call fluidel forces.

952
00:42:24.201 --> 00:42:26.100
<v Voiceover>Fluidel forces, tell us about that.</v>

953
00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.489
<v ->Again, my knowledge of it is limited.</v>

954
00:42:28.489 --> 00:42:29.769
I can tell you what I remember.

955
00:42:29.769 --> 00:42:34.270
Fluidel forces are a kind of plasma or electromagnetic

956
00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:40.254
plasma that each human life form, perhaps there are other

957
00:42:40.254 --> 00:42:43.724
life forms that have some of this, but each human life form

958
00:42:43.724 --> 00:42:46.401
generates it during each lifetime.

959
00:42:46.401 --> 00:42:50.113
And this plasma, this kind of energy, we know

960
00:42:50.113 --> 00:42:53.430
of it's affects sometimes in the form of ghosts.

961
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:54.667
<v Voiceover>Yeah, I was just gonna say,</v>

962
00:42:54.667 --> 00:42:56.128
yeah Ghostbusters deal with that.

963
00:42:56.128 --> 00:42:57.174
(laughs)

964
00:42:57.174 --> 00:42:58.912
<v ->Or, in the case of Colonel Sanders, Poultrygeist.</v>

965
00:42:58.912 --> 00:42:59.840
<v Voiceover>Poultrygeist.</v>

966
00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:00.864
(laughs)

967
00:43:00.864 --> 00:43:02.560
<v ->So you've got this kind of phenomenon,</v>

968
00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.597
plus there's another thing that happens.

969
00:43:04.597 --> 00:43:06.880
It can be very strong with some people.

970
00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.781
A lot of people who are very, quote, unquote, psychics

971
00:43:09.781 --> 00:43:12.661
or have a lot of pent up psychic energy

972
00:43:12.661 --> 00:43:17.460
imbue also jewelry and certain objects with this,

973
00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.465
even the walls of homes and all.

974
00:43:19.465 --> 00:43:21.471
In the Meier material, there's the telling of story

975
00:43:21.471 --> 00:43:23.860
of a woman who was an elderly woman at the time

976
00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.484
living in one location, who, when she would go to sleep

977
00:43:26.484 --> 00:43:30.270
would activate the psychic fluidel forces

978
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:33.726
in her former residence and a child, a girl walking

979
00:43:33.726 --> 00:43:35.006
down the stairs would be seen or something like this

980
00:43:35.006 --> 00:43:36.051
by people, you know.

981
00:43:36.051 --> 00:43:38.558
And it's not something that's usually under people's control

982
00:43:38.558 --> 00:43:41.363
but the fluidel forces contain a lot of information

983
00:43:41.363 --> 00:43:44.616
and in the Meier material they the reason that burial

984
00:43:44.616 --> 00:43:47.378
for the dead, rather than cremation is recommended

985
00:43:47.378 --> 00:43:50.973
is because the fluidel forces bind especially to the bones.

986
00:43:50.973 --> 00:43:54.023
In each new incarnation, when we come in,

987
00:43:54.023 --> 00:43:58.811
purely unconsciously for 99.999% of people, we tap in a bit

988
00:43:58.811 --> 00:44:03.811
and draw from these fluidel forces still bound to the bones

989
00:44:03.898 --> 00:44:08.282
of our previous, the remains of our previous body,

990
00:44:08.282 --> 00:44:09.786
buried in different places.

991
00:44:09.786 --> 00:44:13.647
Again, when you get into the depth of information,

992
00:44:13.647 --> 00:44:16.687
that's why I say it's speculative but there could be some

993
00:44:16.687 --> 00:44:19.428
sense that people could make of this if they want

994
00:44:19.428 --> 00:44:21.401
to reason through it, we can not prove it.

995
00:44:21.401 --> 00:44:22.191
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

996
00:44:22.191 --> 00:44:23.471
<v ->Any more than we, right now,</v>

997
00:44:23.471 --> 00:44:24.878
can prove there's a human spirit.

998
00:44:24.878 --> 00:44:27.086
Hence, we can't prove that it attaches to the embryo

999
00:44:27.086 --> 00:44:30.265
at the 21st day, as the Plejaran claims

1000
00:44:30.265 --> 00:44:33.059
so that they only allow abortion up to the 21st day.

1001
00:44:33.059 --> 00:44:36.515
And thereafter they don't and if we this was true,

1002
00:44:36.515 --> 00:44:38.702
if we knew there was a human spirit, if we could prove

1003
00:44:38.702 --> 00:44:40.675
that it attached the embryo, then we could resolve

1004
00:44:40.675 --> 00:44:43.299
our polarization with abortion here too.

1005
00:44:43.299 --> 00:44:48.120
We are in the midst of vast, you know, if you start digging

1006
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.402
you pull the thread on the Meier case,

1007
00:44:50.402 --> 00:44:53.143
it's not just a simple one-armed farmer

1008
00:44:53.143 --> 00:44:55.394
who makes phenomenal UFO photos.

1009
00:44:55.394 --> 00:44:56.322
(laughs)

1010
00:44:56.322 --> 00:44:57.527
<v Voiceover>You're right.</v>

1011
00:44:57.527 --> 00:44:58.946
Well, you're right.

1012
00:44:58.946 --> 00:45:00.752
There so many questions, this room would be filled

1013
00:45:00.752 --> 00:45:02.285
with nothing but question marks, really.

1014
00:45:02.285 --> 00:45:05.015
But, nonetheless, there are universal truths.

1015
00:45:05.015 --> 00:45:09.388
And we need to start going into some of what he's been given

1016
00:45:09.388 --> 00:45:13.452
to share with humanity, specifically, they chose him

1017
00:45:13.452 --> 00:45:16.193
to share this with humanity because he was a fearless

1018
00:45:16.193 --> 00:45:18.262
individual for intents and purposes.

1019
00:45:18.262 --> 00:45:20.577
<v ->And another reason, simply 'cause his spirit was said</v>

1020
00:45:20.577 --> 00:45:22.251
to be quite ancient and had done it before.

1021
00:45:22.251 --> 00:45:23.158
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1022
00:45:23.158 --> 00:45:25.387
<v ->And would still have the chance to decline the invitaion</v>

1023
00:45:25.387 --> 00:45:28.267
throughout the mission, not just in the beginning.

1024
00:45:28.267 --> 00:45:30.496
<v Voiceover>So we're going to...</v>

1025
00:45:30.496 --> 00:45:31.915
We're gonna go there.

1026
00:45:31.915 --> 00:45:34.283
Okay, and start going into the lessons

1027
00:45:34.283 --> 00:45:37.344
and pick that up in part two.

1028
00:45:37.344 --> 00:45:40.064
I hate for people to have to wait on this one

1029
00:45:40.064 --> 00:45:43.221
but I wanted everyone to get a sense and feel

1030
00:45:43.221 --> 00:45:46.026
of who this man is, who the beings are...

1031
00:45:46.026 --> 00:45:46.975
Oh, one more thing.

1032
00:45:46.975 --> 00:45:49.044
Let's go to a couple of little, not little,

1033
00:45:49.044 --> 00:45:51.946
let's go to a couple bits of evidence for his advanced

1034
00:45:51.946 --> 00:45:54.804
awareness of these subjects.

1035
00:45:54.804 --> 00:45:56.756
So let's talk about the million dollar ice man

1036
00:45:56.756 --> 00:45:59.476
and let's talk about the moons, Jupiter.

1037
00:45:59.476 --> 00:46:00.916
<v ->Moons of Jupiter.</v>

1038
00:46:00.916 --> 00:46:02.398
<v Voiceover>And look at how that played out</v>

1039
00:46:02.398 --> 00:46:05.182
in our world and our media and body of science

1040
00:46:05.182 --> 00:46:07.273
compared to when he was given this information,

1041
00:46:07.273 --> 00:46:09.822
just to kinda get some credit, a little stamp

1042
00:46:09.822 --> 00:46:10.760
of credibility on this.

1043
00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:15.240
<v ->Sure, I think it's October 19, 1978.</v>

1044
00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:20.240
The 150 contact Meier is with Semyaza, who became

1045
00:46:20.467 --> 00:46:24.562
his official contact person, 1975, a Plejaran woman.

1046
00:46:24.562 --> 00:46:26.674
And they are on board her ship in front of Jupiter

1047
00:46:26.674 --> 00:46:30.898
and they're talking about what he's seeing.

1048
00:46:30.898 --> 00:46:34.194
He also refers to when he was previously given

1049
00:46:34.194 --> 00:46:39.068
information about Jupiter, at an earlier time, which I cover

1050
00:46:39.068 --> 00:46:41.543
a little bit later, but anyhow.

1051
00:46:41.543 --> 00:46:44.160
He's describing, he says, "Oh, there are rings

1052
00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.997
around Jupiter, just as I was informed before. And look,

1053
00:46:46.997 --> 00:46:49.760
that's Europa, it's encrusted in ice. That's interesting.

1054
00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:53.194
And that's Io as I recall you telling me before.

1055
00:46:53.194 --> 00:46:56.010
It's the most volcanically active body in the solar system

1056
00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:58.858
with these volcanos spewing out dust particles

1057
00:46:58.858 --> 00:47:01.898
and sulfur ions at speed up to 2500 kilometers,

1058
00:47:01.898 --> 00:47:04.297
reaching heights of a 180 kilometers, what have you.

1059
00:47:04.297 --> 00:47:09.118
That which is not pulled into a ring of Jupiter,

1060
00:47:09.118 --> 00:47:13.332
sulfur particles, falls back onto the surface of the moon Io

1061
00:47:13.332 --> 00:47:16.190
accounting for the relatively smooth surface

1062
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:18.995
with exception of the volcanos but it's not cratered,

1063
00:47:18.995 --> 00:47:20.670
pock-marked as one would--"

1064
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:22.739
And he goes on with all this information.

1065
00:47:22.739 --> 00:47:26.589
Wendell Stevens, lead investigator on the case, is given

1066
00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:29.032
this information on a--

1067
00:47:29.032 --> 00:47:33.394
Has it in his possession by March 9, 1979,

1068
00:47:33.394 --> 00:47:36.274
several months after Meier originally transcribes

1069
00:47:36.274 --> 00:47:38.269
and publishes the information.

1070
00:47:38.269 --> 00:47:41.148
Stevens is given the information but also mistakenly given

1071
00:47:41.148 --> 00:47:44.444
10 other predictions he wasn't supposed to have

1072
00:47:44.444 --> 00:47:46.279
in his possession because of they hadn't occurred yet

1073
00:47:46.279 --> 00:47:48.999
and Meier is not allowed to publish certain specific

1074
00:47:48.999 --> 00:47:51.313
predictions before they actually occur like the deaths

1075
00:47:51.313 --> 00:47:53.244
of Heads of States, and blah, blah, blah.

1076
00:47:53.244 --> 00:47:54.449
It's a little heavy.

1077
00:47:54.449 --> 00:47:58.278
So, anyhow, Jupiter information, Wendell comes back

1078
00:47:58.278 --> 00:48:00.561
to America with it.

1079
00:48:00.561 --> 00:48:04.347
He shows it to two trusted people, O. Richard Norton

1080
00:48:04.347 --> 00:48:06.342
who, I think, was the head of the Flandrau...

1081
00:48:06.342 --> 00:48:08.592
Wait, the Flandrau planetarium in Tucson and

1082
00:48:08.592 --> 00:48:13.592
Major Pestalozzi, who was, Rudolph Pestalozzi,

1083
00:48:15.612 --> 00:48:19.131
another lieutenant colonel from the U.S. Air Force.

1084
00:48:19.131 --> 00:48:21.361
They read this information and sign off on it

1085
00:48:21.361 --> 00:48:23.270
and Wendell puts it in the safe or something

1086
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:24.635
for good keeping.

1087
00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:27.728
On March 12, I think it was a Monday, 1979,

1088
00:48:27.728 --> 00:48:30.981
NASA JPL makes an announcement about the results

1089
00:48:30.981 --> 00:48:34.533
of the Voyager spacecraft taking its pictures of Jupiter.

1090
00:48:34.533 --> 00:48:36.229
Well, they've revealed that Jupiter does have rings

1091
00:48:36.229 --> 00:48:39.504
but they claim, in this press conference, that the most

1092
00:48:39.504 --> 00:48:43.034
important discovery of the entire mission

1093
00:48:43.034 --> 00:48:46.703
is that Jupiter has a moon called Io that they know,

1094
00:48:46.703 --> 00:48:50.739
it's the most volcanically active body in the solar system.

1095
00:48:51.535 --> 00:48:53.039
They think it's a new finding,

1096
00:48:53.039 --> 00:48:54.404
Meier had already published it.

1097
00:48:54.404 --> 00:48:56.921
Now, when I sent this off to Joseph Veverka

1098
00:48:56.921 --> 00:48:59.353
at Cornell University, JPL NASA guy,

1099
00:48:59.353 --> 00:49:03.235
and then talked to him on the phone after he'd read it

1100
00:49:03.235 --> 00:49:06.478
he said, "Well, if this man said that, three to six months

1101
00:49:06.478 --> 00:49:08.270
before. All I can say, is that he's right."

1102
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:10.222
And then he wouldn't want to talk about the rest of it

1103
00:49:10.222 --> 00:49:11.310
and literally hung up.

1104
00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:13.304
So that got interesting.

1105
00:49:13.304 --> 00:49:17.602
Then in April, I think it is, of 1980 in Science Magazine,

1106
00:49:17.602 --> 00:49:20.418
there's an article with this little bit of information

1107
00:49:20.418 --> 00:49:23.159
about the discovery of a ring of Jupiters

1108
00:49:23.159 --> 00:49:26.289
with ionized sulfur particles.

1109
00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:29.612
Meier had written about a year and a half before.

1110
00:49:29.612 --> 00:49:33.772
Now, how does a Swiss farmer not only publish

1111
00:49:33.772 --> 00:49:36.396
the most important discovery of the Voyager?

1112
00:49:36.396 --> 00:49:37.324
(laughs)

1113
00:49:37.324 --> 00:49:40.940
But then, a year and a half later, Science Magazine

1114
00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:43.425
mentions this relatively obscure thing.

1115
00:49:43.425 --> 00:49:45.707
I didn't know about any of this.

1116
00:49:45.707 --> 00:49:48.353
Nobody watching this interview knew

1117
00:49:48.353 --> 00:49:51.926
about the ionized sulfur particles ring of Jupiter

1118
00:49:51.926 --> 00:49:55.104
and Meier had indeed published before and published it

1119
00:49:55.104 --> 00:49:58.746
in a document that I had read back in '80's as well.

1120
00:49:59.403 --> 00:50:00.746
<v Voiceover>So there's one.</v>

1121
00:50:00.746 --> 00:50:02.794
What about the million dollar ice man?

1122
00:50:02.794 --> 00:50:06.325
<v ->In 1991, Meier has a contact with Ptah,</v>

1123
00:50:06.325 --> 00:50:09.781
the father of Semyaza and the ostensibly the leader

1124
00:50:09.781 --> 00:50:13.684
of Plejaran race at this time and then for some time.

1125
00:50:13.684 --> 00:50:15.817
Ptah says, and he doesn't give it to him

1126
00:50:15.817 --> 00:50:18.420
as prophetic information, he tells him conversationally.

1127
00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:20.809
Much of, what I call, prophetic information.

1128
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:23.828
Some is given as prophesy and some is simply conversational.

1129
00:50:23.828 --> 00:50:27.027
He says, "By the way," this is May of '91.

1130
00:50:27.027 --> 00:50:29.310
He says, "By the way, in August or September of this year

1131
00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:32.766
a discovery will be made in the Austrian Alps of a mummy

1132
00:50:32.766 --> 00:50:36.862
of a man who lived more than 5100 years ago.

1133
00:50:36.862 --> 00:50:39.464
And they will find many artifacts and different things

1134
00:50:39.464 --> 00:50:43.730
and two of our own distant ancestors interacted

1135
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:46.514
with this man because he helped save them

1136
00:50:46.514 --> 00:50:47.933
from a bear attack."

1137
00:50:47.933 --> 00:50:51.090
When they encountered technical problems with their ship

1138
00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:53.020
and they got out and they could've been killed,

1139
00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:54.087
blah, blah, blah.

1140
00:50:54.087 --> 00:50:55.687
They befriended this man,

1141
00:50:55.687 --> 00:50:57.916
they took him on numerous excursions.

1142
00:50:57.916 --> 00:50:59.591
They taught him things and he became

1143
00:50:59.591 --> 00:51:03.537
a rather prominent man in his prehistoric culture.

1144
00:51:03.537 --> 00:51:05.436
Which, you'll see was...

1145
00:51:05.436 --> 00:51:08.060
Okay I won't jump to all the pay off here.

1146
00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:10.875
Anyhow, and he told them of a number of things,

1147
00:51:10.875 --> 00:51:13.819
some of which I will tell you after I tell you the rest.

1148
00:51:13.819 --> 00:51:16.816
That discovery was made accidentally by some wanderers

1149
00:51:16.816 --> 00:51:18.726
up in the Alps who thought it was a guy

1150
00:51:18.726 --> 00:51:20.528
who'd died recently in an avalanche.

1151
00:51:20.528 --> 00:51:23.088
And they see this, you know, garb that doesn't look

1152
00:51:23.088 --> 00:51:24.869
at all, contemporary so they get scientists

1153
00:51:24.869 --> 00:51:25.946
to come in there.

1154
00:51:25.946 --> 00:51:28.336
The body's preserved in ice,

1155
00:51:28.336 --> 00:51:30.682
it's taken to university or whatever like that

1156
00:51:30.682 --> 00:51:33.658
and here they've got a 5100 year old guy.

1157
00:51:33.658 --> 00:51:35.770
Okay, Meier was right, they're gonna discover this.

1158
00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:38.671
Well, someone could say, well maybe he postdated it.

1159
00:51:38.671 --> 00:51:41.668
Well, Meier did publish the whole body of information

1160
00:51:41.668 --> 00:51:44.900
again in 1996 and we show the book and the cover

1161
00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:46.265
and the copyright date.

1162
00:51:46.265 --> 00:51:48.612
Oh, certainly, he must have post dated it.

1163
00:51:48.612 --> 00:51:50.425
No, follow along.

1164
00:51:50.425 --> 00:51:53.369
In 2001, the scientist decide to bring the mummy in

1165
00:51:53.369 --> 00:51:57.848
to do a CT scan to determined what killed him.

1166
00:51:57.848 --> 00:52:00.760
The find a fractured skull,

1167
00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:02.989
and they find an arrow in his back.

1168
00:52:02.989 --> 00:52:07.661
So they conclude, in what they think is a logical manner,

1169
00:52:07.661 --> 00:52:09.474
that he was slain by somebody.

1170
00:52:09.474 --> 00:52:11.074
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

1171
00:52:11.074 --> 00:52:12.354
<v ->Killed him with an arrow.</v>

1172
00:52:12.354 --> 00:52:15.725
So we go back to the 1991 document

1173
00:52:15.725 --> 00:52:18.178
and if you don't accept it, it was published in '91.

1174
00:52:18.178 --> 00:52:20.919
It was published again in '96, same document.

1175
00:52:20.919 --> 00:52:24.801
And therein, we are told that this man died

1176
00:52:24.801 --> 00:52:28.001
because he had an epileptic seizure,

1177
00:52:28.001 --> 00:52:31.510
fell back a distance to the ground

1178
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:34.619
on one of his arrows.

1179
00:52:35.638 --> 00:52:38.358
Now, it gets better, actually.

1180
00:52:38.358 --> 00:52:39.894
His arrow was lodged in his back.

1181
00:52:39.894 --> 00:52:44.352
A friend writes me a says, by the way, that's really amazing

1182
00:52:44.352 --> 00:52:46.635
but one more thing is even more amazing.

1183
00:52:46.635 --> 00:52:48.949
Meier is right, nobody killed him.

1184
00:52:48.949 --> 00:52:50.208
I say, "Hey, why do you figure that?"

1185
00:52:50.208 --> 00:52:54.755
He said, "Well, in primitive times, 5100 years ago,

1186
00:52:54.755 --> 00:52:56.526
let alone, a couple hundred years ago,

1187
00:52:56.526 --> 00:52:58.798
when people were hand-making their weapons,

1188
00:52:58.798 --> 00:53:02.093
Cutting arrowheads, knife blades, axes and things,

1189
00:53:02.093 --> 00:53:05.112
those were, they were like gold.

1190
00:53:05.112 --> 00:53:08.408
It took a long time to make, and you never left it

1191
00:53:08.408 --> 00:53:10.829
in your prey, if you slew an animal or if you slew

1192
00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:13.986
and opponent, there was any way, you would go back

1193
00:53:13.986 --> 00:53:15.351
and pull it out.

1194
00:53:15.351 --> 00:53:16.749
<v Voiceover>Makes sense, yeah.</v>

1195
00:53:16.749 --> 00:53:19.138
<v ->Now, when I did more searching on the internet,</v>

1196
00:53:19.138 --> 00:53:21.506
on the National Geographic and other sites,

1197
00:53:21.506 --> 00:53:24.343
more details were given later about what the did find

1198
00:53:24.343 --> 00:53:25.495
with the man.

1199
00:53:25.495 --> 00:53:28.801
Indeed, the found a quiver with arrows in it.

1200
00:53:28.801 --> 00:53:31.724
The found an axe and other items of great value

1201
00:53:31.724 --> 00:53:34.806
that showed his status reflecting what Ptah had said

1202
00:53:34.806 --> 00:53:36.854
about status in his community.

1203
00:53:36.854 --> 00:53:39.699
And they found a broken arrow..

1204
00:53:39.699 --> 00:53:41.139
<v Voiceover>Ah, yeah.</v>

1205
00:53:41.139 --> 00:53:44.413
<v ->So put it all together and Billy Meier,</v>

1206
00:53:44.413 --> 00:53:48.104
simple, one-armed, Swiss farmer who hopes his UFO photos--

1207
00:53:48.104 --> 00:53:49.149
<v Voiceover>Yeah, right.</v>

1208
00:53:49.149 --> 00:53:53.570
<v ->Publishes 10 years before it's discovered the exact cause,</v>

1209
00:53:53.570 --> 00:53:56.567
after he'd published the discovery

1210
00:53:56.567 --> 00:53:58.519
of the body months before that,

1211
00:53:58.519 --> 00:54:02.977
the exact cause of death and the presumed accurate status

1212
00:54:02.977 --> 00:54:05.995
of a man who died 5100 years ago.

1213
00:54:05.995 --> 00:54:08.182
So as I say in the article on my website,

1214
00:54:08.182 --> 00:54:11.040
this man now reaches a frozen hand across time

1215
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:14.048
to validate and authenticate the Billy Meier case.

1216
00:54:14.048 --> 00:54:16.512
<v Voiceover>And there are many more where that came from.</v>

1217
00:54:16.512 --> 00:54:17.632
<v ->Tons.</v>

1218
00:54:17.632 --> 00:54:18.837
<v Voiceover>Many, many, more.</v>

1219
00:54:18.837 --> 00:54:21.088
We'll just leave it with people to understand

1220
00:54:21.088 --> 00:54:24.128
this information that is coming through has been validated

1221
00:54:24.128 --> 00:54:25.226
many times over.

1222
00:54:25.226 --> 00:54:28.725
And now, when we pick it up in the next episode

1223
00:54:28.725 --> 00:54:31.626
we're going to talk about some of the information valuable

1224
00:54:31.626 --> 00:54:34.186
to us now, right here on the planet

1225
00:54:34.186 --> 00:54:35.508
at this point in history.

1226
00:54:35.508 --> 00:54:36.831
Thank you.

1227
00:54:40.791 --> 00:54:43.041
If you're intrigued by the Billy Meier case

1228
00:54:43.041 --> 00:54:45.132
you will certainly want to watch our next inteview

1230
00:54:46.316 --> 00:54:48.054
Meanwhile, more information on the subject

1231
00:54:48.054 --> 00:54:51.265
of extra terrestrial life can be accessed in our interviews

1232
00:54:51.265 --> 00:54:54.401
with Alfred Webber, Steven Bassett, Deloris Cannon.

1233
00:54:54.401 --> 00:54:57.243
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
