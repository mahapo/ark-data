00:00:00.685 --> 00:00:02.008
<v ->Donna Eden is one of the most</v>

2
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:04.162
joyful people I have ever met.

3
00:00:04.162 --> 00:00:05.815
Which is the observation of most people

4
00:00:05.815 --> 00:00:07.394
who know or have met her.

5
00:00:07.394 --> 00:00:10.016
This is either because of, or in spite of the fact

6
00:00:10.016 --> 00:00:12.530
that her early years were severely challenging.

7
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.952
By the age of sixteen, she had tuberculosis.

8
00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:17.995
multiple sclerosis, and a myriad of other ailments

9
00:00:17.995 --> 00:00:21.298
stemming from an inability to digest foods.

10
00:00:21.298 --> 00:00:23.944
But, as necessity is the mother of invention,

11
00:00:23.944 --> 00:00:25.426
she stumbled upon the ability of

12
00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:27.559
one's own hands to heal.

13
00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:29.074
Today she has taught thousands

14
00:00:29.074 --> 00:00:30.716
upon thousands her method of

15
00:00:30.716 --> 00:00:33.650
inspiring the body to heal itself through touch.

16
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.318
And how to begin seeing energy once again,

17
00:00:36.318 --> 00:00:38.334
in the process.

18
00:00:38.334 --> 00:00:43.334 line:15% 
(peaceful ambient music)

19
00:00:46.653 --> 00:00:47.389
<v Regina>I'm so glad we could</v>

20
00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:48.477
spend a little time together.

21
00:00:48.477 --> 00:00:50.117
I've seen you a lot on Youtube

22
00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:51.557
and out there in cyberland,

23
00:00:51.557 --> 00:00:53.722
and your beautiful energy and sparkly eyes.

24
00:00:53.722 --> 00:00:55.280
You're even more sparkly in person

25
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.901
than you are on the net.

26
00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:57.989
(laughing)

27
00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:58.991
<v ->Oh, thank you.</v>

28
00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Regina>Donna, how did this begin for you?</v>

29
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.205
The whole journey into Energy Medicine.

30
00:01:03.205 --> 00:01:04.271
And you're really one of the

31
00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:06.523
top people in the world in this subject.

32
00:01:06.523 --> 00:01:11.003
<v ->Well, this all came about because I was so sick.</v>

33
00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:14.454
From the time I was a little girl.

34
00:01:14.454 --> 00:01:17.024
I had tuberculosis and then I was

35
00:01:17.024 --> 00:01:20.029
allergic to everything under the sun.

36
00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:22.931
My mother fed us very well.

37
00:01:22.931 --> 00:01:26.091
I didn't even have sugar till I was in seventh grade.

38
00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:29.066
But it didn't matter, my immune system

39
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.893
was very down and I was born, evidently,

40
00:01:31.893 --> 00:01:34.725
without the ability to make three enzymes.

41
00:01:35.073 --> 00:01:37.536
Everything kept hitting me and by the time

42
00:01:37.536 --> 00:01:40.742
I was sixteen, I had multiple sclerosis.

43
00:01:41.324 --> 00:01:44.481
Then at twenty-seven I had a heart attack.

44
00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:47.084
And then I had breast cancer in my early thirties.

45
00:01:47.084 --> 00:01:48.545
(laughing)

46
00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:50.774
I had asthma.

47
00:01:50.774 --> 00:01:54.614
I had several different doctors tell me

48
00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:58.699
that it was terminal, because my organs

49
00:01:58.699 --> 00:02:01.270
were breaking down so fast.

50
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.619
When I didn't walk for much of two years.

51
00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.635
Somebody really made it clear that there

52
00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:10.122
was nothing more that western medicine could do.

53
00:02:10.122 --> 00:02:11.818
I often thought that was one of the

54
00:02:11.818 --> 00:02:14.476
best things that could have ever happened to me.

55
00:02:14.476 --> 00:02:17.389
Because of course I had to heal myself then.

56
00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:18.497
<v Regina>Right.</v>

57
00:02:18.497 --> 00:02:21.358
<v ->I gave up on them, I didn't take their medicines.</v>

58
00:02:21.358 --> 00:02:24.377
I just started working with the energy in my body.

59
00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:25.326
<v Regina>Well now, how did you even</v>

60
00:02:25.326 --> 00:02:26.627
know to do that?

61
00:02:26.627 --> 00:02:29.881
<v ->Well, I was laying in bed, unable to walk.</v>

62
00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:33.806
It was really my thighs, from my hips to my knees.

63
00:02:33.806 --> 00:02:36.216
Just had no energy running through them.

64
00:02:36.216 --> 00:02:39.149
I noticed when I put my hand on my knees,

65
00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:41.048
my other hand's at my thighs,

66
00:02:41.048 --> 00:02:43.650
took about three minutes and

67
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.784
I could feel it starting to move.

68
00:02:45.784 --> 00:02:47.415
<v Regina>So this is just something you stumbled upon?</v>

69
00:02:47.415 --> 00:02:48.706
<v ->I stumbled.</v>

70
00:02:48.706 --> 00:02:50.637
I stumbled.

71
00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:53.378
That was the very beginning.

72
00:02:53.378 --> 00:02:55.884
I went off and lived in Fiji for awhile.

73
00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:59.319
The environment was so clean and healing there.

74
00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.716
I got better and better.

75
00:03:00.716 --> 00:03:03.596
But I came back to the United States.

76
00:03:03.596 --> 00:03:06.401
I really wanted to do this for a living.

77
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:07.958
At that time, in the seventies,

78
00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:08.929
let me tell you.

79
00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:10.742
<v Regina>Wasn't much out there.</v>

80
00:03:10.742 --> 00:03:14.251
<v ->But I did find the Touch for Health Foundation</v>

81
00:03:14.251 --> 00:03:17.291
very synchronistically, one of those

82
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:20.053
supposed to happen sort of things.

83
00:03:20.053 --> 00:03:22.187
They were teaching people how to muscle test.

84
00:03:22.187 --> 00:03:23.072
<v Regina>Right.</v>

85
00:03:23.072 --> 00:03:24.074
'Cause they're kinesiology.

86
00:03:24.074 --> 00:03:26.560
<v ->They're kinesiology.</v>

87
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.874
I realized, from the beginning,

88
00:03:28.874 --> 00:03:30.922
I thought of it as energy testing.

89
00:03:30.922 --> 00:03:32.991
I would be able to show people

90
00:03:32.991 --> 00:03:36.359
what it is I'm seeing and what I'm doing.

91
00:03:37.314 --> 00:03:40.610
They would have feedback in their body fast.

92
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.932
Because nobody believed anybody

93
00:03:41.932 --> 00:03:43.724
could see energy at that time.

94
00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:44.652
<v Regina>Right.</v>

95
00:03:44.652 --> 00:03:46.327
But you could see it at this time?

96
00:03:46.327 --> 00:03:47.297
<v ->Yes and,</v>

97
00:03:47.297 --> 00:03:50.038
I would like to say that I really believe

98
00:03:50.038 --> 00:03:51.414
every human being born, sees it when they're born.

99
00:03:51.414 --> 00:03:55.787
But we live in a culture where nobody

100
00:03:55.787 --> 00:03:58.017
keeps talking about it, keeps it up.

101
00:03:58.017 --> 00:03:59.339
And it goes dormant by the time you're

102
00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:00.843
about a year old.

103
00:04:00.843 --> 00:04:04.022
I had a mother who kept talking about it.

104
00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:07.467
And my brother who is a real redneck, sees energy.

105
00:04:07.467 --> 00:04:11.552
My sister, in a totally non-related field, sees energy.

106
00:04:11.552 --> 00:04:14.751
It was simply because she kept it alive.

107
00:04:14.751 --> 00:04:19.751
And, in Ashland, Oregon, where I really do consider my home.

108
00:04:21.556 --> 00:04:24.948
We just get to go back a few times a year.

109
00:04:24.948 --> 00:04:27.519
I had a practice there for twenty-three years.

110
00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:32.519
I began telling people, pregnant parents,

111
00:04:33.097 --> 00:04:35.348
that when that baby is born, you just

112
00:04:35.348 --> 00:04:37.086
keep talking about the colors.

113
00:04:37.086 --> 00:04:39.091
Keep talking about the aura.

114
00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:41.918
Keep talking about that energy.

115
00:04:41.918 --> 00:04:44.264
Chances are, it'll stay alive.

116
00:04:44.264 --> 00:04:46.216
That's exactly what happened.

117
00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:48.765
<v Regina>So you had never lost it then.</v>

118
00:04:48.765 --> 00:04:49.725
<v ->That's right.</v>

119
00:04:49.725 --> 00:04:51.069
<v Regina>You had maintained it.</v>

120
00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:53.618
What did the world look like to you as a little girl?

121
00:04:53.618 --> 00:04:55.410
And was this something because your family

122
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.013
was accustomed to it, you didn't think it was different?

123
00:04:58.013 --> 00:05:00.103
<v ->I didn't think it was anything different.</v>

124
00:05:00.103 --> 00:05:02.727
I thought the whole world saw energy.

125
00:05:02.727 --> 00:05:05.159
And I was almost twenty-two before

126
00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.316
I found out the world didn't.

127
00:05:08.316 --> 00:05:13.316
My rude awakening, I just got married to a man

128
00:05:13.894 --> 00:05:15.932
who said he was gonna put me in a mental institution

129
00:05:15.932 --> 00:05:17.886
if I ever brought that up again.

130
00:05:17.886 --> 00:05:19.208
(laughing)

131
00:05:19.208 --> 00:05:21.672
<v Regina>Oh, that's like a two by four on the subject.</v>

132
00:05:21.672 --> 00:05:23.016
<v ->Marriage didn't last too long.</v>

133
00:05:23.016 --> 00:05:24.808
(laughing)

134
00:05:24.808 --> 00:05:29.106
It was, "You're nuts, you're crazy if you do that."

135
00:05:29.106 --> 00:05:31.122
But for me, because it was natural,

136
00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:33.309
I wondered how in the world did

137
00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:35.858
people make up their minds about something?

138
00:05:35.858 --> 00:05:38.439
How did they know where they're absolutely safe?

139
00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:40.975
How do they figure life out?

140
00:05:40.975 --> 00:05:42.073
<v Regina>Let's talk about, say,</v>

141
00:05:42.073 --> 00:05:43.535
when you were a teenager, even.

142
00:05:43.535 --> 00:05:44.740
In those developmental years.

143
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.276
I mean, obviously you had physical illness,

144
00:05:46.276 --> 00:05:48.388
but how did you see the world of energy

145
00:05:48.388 --> 00:05:50.798
and how did you utilize it to ascertain

146
00:05:50.798 --> 00:05:52.793
information for your own guidance?

147
00:05:52.793 --> 00:05:53.603
<v ->Yes.</v>

148
00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:54.883
It was a growing thing.

149
00:05:54.883 --> 00:05:57.411
Because after years you start understanding.

150
00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:00.174
That that color always means this.

151
00:06:00.174 --> 00:06:02.403
Or that sort of thing.

152
00:06:02.403 --> 00:06:04.685
Color was always interesting to me.

153
00:06:04.685 --> 00:06:09.421
But the aura that surrounds the body,

154
00:06:09.421 --> 00:06:13.389
I see at least seven to nine layers.

155
00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.109
But that was not nearly as interesting to me

156
00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:18.477
as the chakras that spun,

157
00:06:18.477 --> 00:06:19.682
because you could see where

158
00:06:19.682 --> 00:06:21.420
people were getting into trouble.

159
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.537
Or you could see where what they were saying,

160
00:06:25.537 --> 00:06:28.247
and it wasn't that I thought that people were lying.

161
00:06:28.247 --> 00:06:30.454
But what they were saying wasn't

162
00:06:30.454 --> 00:06:32.566
in sync with what was happening,

163
00:06:32.566 --> 00:06:34.358
and people didn't know better.

164
00:06:34.358 --> 00:06:38.027
Really, if anything it made you very compassionate.

165
00:06:38.027 --> 00:06:40.598
Because you saw, people were kind of lost

166
00:06:40.598 --> 00:06:43.851
without this guiding force of energy.

167
00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:45.504
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

168
00:06:45.504 --> 00:06:48.309
<v ->So, it was always hard.</v>

169
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:52.096
I'll say this, it was always hard once a month.

170
00:06:52.096 --> 00:06:53.066
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

171
00:06:53.066 --> 00:06:55.584
<v ->During my cycle, because then</v>

172
00:06:55.584 --> 00:06:57.365
I couldn't turn it off at all.

173
00:06:57.365 --> 00:06:59.615
<v Regina>The sensitivity was so wide open.</v>

174
00:06:59.615 --> 00:07:01.034
<v ->It was extreme.</v>

175
00:07:01.034 --> 00:07:03.444
So I'd wanna run up and tell somebody,

176
00:07:03.444 --> 00:07:06.516
"Oh my God, you've got cancer you've gotta do something."

177
00:07:06.516 --> 00:07:09.716
It was very, very hard, the sensitivity.

178
00:07:10.706 --> 00:07:11.907
And that was one of the thing's

179
00:07:11.907 --> 00:07:13.742
that Energy Medicine also helped me with.

180
00:07:13.742 --> 00:07:15.480
That kind of sensitivity.

181
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.891
I'm still as sensitive as I ever was,

182
00:07:17.891 --> 00:07:20.259
but I'm not knocked over anymore.

183
00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:22.701
<v Regina>Yes, I think you've had time to adapt.</v>

184
00:07:22.701 --> 00:07:23.832
<v ->Yes.</v>

185
00:07:23.832 --> 00:07:25.997
<v Regina>Okay, let's go back to your twenties.</v>

186
00:07:25.997 --> 00:07:28.440
After you had had your hand on your hip

187
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.421
and your hand on your knee,

188
00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:31.746
you noticed the energy flowing then.

189
00:07:33.326 --> 00:07:35.827
I assume you got in touch with that organization.

190
00:07:35.827 --> 00:07:37.288
Then how did it develop from there?

191
00:07:37.288 --> 00:07:40.467
Because you go both modern and retro,

192
00:07:40.467 --> 00:07:41.885
back to ancient knowledge.

193
00:07:41.885 --> 00:07:46.301
<v ->I really believe that what I teach and do.</v>

194
00:07:46.301 --> 00:07:50.568
Yes, it's some of the modern world is catching up

195
00:07:50.568 --> 00:07:53.757
with probably the oldest medicine on earth.

196
00:07:53.757 --> 00:07:57.138
It's probably what kept our ancestors alive.

197
00:07:57.138 --> 00:07:58.514
I mean long before they understood

198
00:07:58.514 --> 00:08:00.487
what foods were good for them,

199
00:08:00.487 --> 00:08:02.321
they learned to rub themselves

200
00:08:02.321 --> 00:08:04.391
if they didn't feel good.

201
00:08:04.391 --> 00:08:05.575
Something like that.

202
00:08:05.575 --> 00:08:08.358
I think that they had to understand energy.

203
00:08:08.358 --> 00:08:11.462
Because there were no doctors on any corner.

204
00:08:12.622 --> 00:08:15.790
This was how you survived.

205
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.465
Sometimes, I teach a class, even today.

206
00:08:22.685 --> 00:08:25.905
I teach a class by how people are

207
00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:28.581
holding their postures in a class.

208
00:08:28.581 --> 00:08:31.685
Because I really came to understand

209
00:08:31.685 --> 00:08:35.589
that the body is always trying to heal you.

210
00:08:37.089 --> 00:08:41.199
The energy systems in our body are brilliant.

211
00:08:41.199 --> 00:08:45.380
They're far more intelligent than our brains.

212
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.534
And they know how to heal us already.

213
00:08:47.534 --> 00:08:51.549
<v Regina>Let's talk about posture, tell me about that.</v>

214
00:08:51.758 --> 00:08:52.819
<v ->Well.</v>

215
00:08:52.828 --> 00:08:53.505
<v Regina>This is important,</v>

216
00:08:53.505 --> 00:08:54.827
'cause we all have this choice.

217
00:08:54.827 --> 00:08:55.670
<v ->Yes.</v>

218
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.014
<v Regina>It's so intrinsic to our lives.</v>

219
00:08:57.014 --> 00:08:59.499
<v ->Yes, well what I would say.</v>

220
00:08:59.499 --> 00:09:01.437
Two things, I guess I would say.

221
00:09:02.136 --> 00:09:04.941
One, is the more you work with your energy systems.

222
00:09:04.941 --> 00:09:07.203
The more your posture gets straighter and

223
00:09:07.203 --> 00:09:09.570
the energies flow through your body

224
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:14.135
so that you just feel more vital and alive all the time.

225
00:09:14.135 --> 00:09:17.250
It just so happens that the energy starts

226
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.927
going up your spine, clearer,

227
00:09:19.927 --> 00:09:23.244
and makes more space between the vertebrae.

228
00:09:23.244 --> 00:09:26.775
Just, you just have a straighter posture.

229
00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:28.375
But there's something else.

230
00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:31.713
That is that people often go into postures

231
00:09:31.713 --> 00:09:34.870
and they don't even know they've gone into that posture.

232
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.750
For instance, if you're sitting in a classroom

233
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.862
and their ankles are crossed.

234
00:09:39.862 --> 00:09:42.312
Or maybe they're sitting like this.

235
00:09:44.352 --> 00:09:45.658
<v Regina>What does that do?</v>

236
00:09:45.658 --> 00:09:46.597
<v ->What does this mean?</v>

237
00:09:46.597 --> 00:09:48.792
Okay, when you cross this line.

238
00:09:48.792 --> 00:09:51.811
This is Governing Meridian, the end of Governing.

239
00:09:51.811 --> 00:09:55.949
This is the end of Central Meridian, but it also

240
00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:59.032
is something utterly different than the meridians.

241
00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:02.200
It's called the radiant circuits.

242
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.517
The radiant circuits, there are eight of them,

243
00:10:05.517 --> 00:10:08.237
that connect up fields of energy.

244
00:10:08.237 --> 00:10:10.532
This is the Penetrating Flow.

245
00:10:10.532 --> 00:10:13.081
So, when you're pondering, or penetrating.

246
00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:14.334
You want it to go in deep.

247
00:10:14.334 --> 00:10:15.310
<v ->{Regina] Oh, interesting.</v>

248
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:17.084
<v ->You put your fingers this way.</v>

249
00:10:17.084 --> 00:10:18.161
There's just all.

250
00:10:18.161 --> 00:10:19.057
<v Regina>People touch their lips.</v>

251
00:10:19.057 --> 00:10:20.337
<v ->Yes.</v>

252
00:10:21.527 --> 00:10:26.058
When people put their fingers on the side of their head.

253
00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:27.935
What is going on here?

254
00:10:27.935 --> 00:10:30.239
Now, when my finger goes here up to

255
00:10:30.239 --> 00:10:33.791
these points are called neurovascular points.

256
00:10:33.791 --> 00:10:36.692
The longer you hold them, the longer you will

257
00:10:36.692 --> 00:10:39.753
pull blood up through your brain,

258
00:10:39.753 --> 00:10:43.209
to sort of clear out the field, so you can think better.

259
00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:44.254
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

260
00:10:44.254 --> 00:10:47.070
<v ->There are those kinds of points all over the head.</v>

261
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.766
Okay, how 'bout this.

262
00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:51.368
When people get stressed out.

263
00:10:51.368 --> 00:10:54.077
How many times have you seen somebody go,

264
00:10:54.077 --> 00:10:55.731
"Oh my God."

265
00:10:55.731 --> 00:10:56.637
<v Regina>Right.</v>

266
00:10:56.637 --> 00:10:58.862
Or sit with their head in their hands.

267
00:11:00.872 --> 00:11:04.519
<v ->That's instinct and we carry it in our bones</v>

268
00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:06.492
in our blood, I mean that's something

269
00:11:06.492 --> 00:11:09.137
we've carried forth for millions of years.

270
00:11:09.137 --> 00:11:09.844
But.

271
00:11:09.844 --> 00:11:10.952
<v Regina>What does that mean?</v>

272
00:11:10.952 --> 00:11:12.211
<v ->Tend to take.</v>

273
00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:14.921
When you get very, very stressed.

274
00:11:14.921 --> 00:11:18.924
You can lose the blood, you can, you do lose

275
00:11:18.924 --> 00:11:20.940
the blood from your forebrain.

276
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.425
You can lose up to eighty percent of the

277
00:11:23.425 --> 00:11:26.113
blood from your forebrain, when you get very stressed.

278
00:11:26.113 --> 00:11:27.276
<v Regina>That makes sense, you can feel</v>

279
00:11:27.276 --> 00:11:28.481
it draining out of your head.

280
00:11:28.481 --> 00:11:30.273
<v ->You can feel it draining.</v>

281
00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:33.729
It's either for the fight, or flight, or freeze response.

282
00:11:33.729 --> 00:11:37.398
To beat somebody up, or run away.

283
00:11:37.398 --> 00:11:40.587
In our culture, we can do neither.

284
00:11:40.587 --> 00:11:42.763
I mean, so often, there's no one you're gonna beat up

285
00:11:42.763 --> 00:11:45.858
and you can't run away, and you're stuck.

286
00:11:45.858 --> 00:11:48.502
But you've already lost the blood from your forebrain.

287
00:11:48.502 --> 00:11:52.129
We weren't made to have a thinking brain in the beginning.

288
00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:53.014
<v Regina>Right.</v>

289
00:11:53.014 --> 00:11:55.329
<v ->We were made to beat somebody up or run away.</v>

290
00:11:55.329 --> 00:11:57.984
So when you throw your hand up here,

291
00:11:57.984 --> 00:12:01.163
you start drawing the blood back up into your forebrain.

292
00:12:01.163 --> 00:12:04.011
Cause your hand is electromagnetic.

293
00:12:04.011 --> 00:12:08.641
And you will just automatically start lifting the blood up.

294
00:12:08.641 --> 00:12:10.497
Somebody should have told everybody.

295
00:12:10.497 --> 00:12:12.118
Don't take your hand away.

296
00:12:12.118 --> 00:12:14.836
Keep it there, until you feel,

297
00:12:14.836 --> 00:12:15.463
(inhales)

298
00:12:15.463 --> 00:12:17.336
"Wow, I'm okay again."

299
00:12:18.067 --> 00:12:19.475
<v Regina>That's fascinating.</v>

300
00:12:19.475 --> 00:12:22.408
This is true really, throughout the entire body.

301
00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:23.475
Everywhere you go.

302
00:12:23.475 --> 00:12:25.825
<v ->Throughout the entire body, exactly right.</v>

303
00:12:25.825 --> 00:12:28.353
<v Regina>What are some of the biggest.</v>

304
00:12:28.353 --> 00:12:30.699
Well, first of all, we were talking off camera.

305
00:12:30.699 --> 00:12:33.910
You were saying, "We did not evolve for these times."

306
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:34.902
<v ->That's right.</v>

307
00:12:34.902 --> 00:12:36.181
<v Regina>This body is not evolved for these times.</v>

308
00:12:36.181 --> 00:12:37.547
First, can you explain what that means?

309
00:12:37.547 --> 00:12:38.171
<v ->Yes.</v>

310
00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:40.859
It took us probably two million years

311
00:12:40.859 --> 00:12:43.184
to get to this place.

312
00:12:43.184 --> 00:12:47.344
But the world that we evolved in sync with ended

313
00:12:47.344 --> 00:12:50.245
about a hundred and thirty years ago.

314
00:12:50.245 --> 00:12:53.924
Then unnatural things began to come about.

315
00:12:53.924 --> 00:12:57.849
More so in the last thirty to fifty years, even so.

316
00:12:57.849 --> 00:13:02.350
But now, every square inch of our atmosphere

317
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:06.350
is filled with manmade electromagnetic energies.

318
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:07.097
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

319
00:13:07.097 --> 00:13:10.734
<v ->That our bodies have to deal with.</v>

320
00:13:10.734 --> 00:13:14.297
There is an energy in our body called Triple Warmer.

321
00:13:14.297 --> 00:13:19.033
Triple Warmer Meridian its entire job is to keep us safe.

322
00:13:19.033 --> 00:13:23.097
If something comes in at us or in us

323
00:13:23.097 --> 00:13:26.873
that it doesn't recognize, it will often fight it.

324
00:13:26.873 --> 00:13:31.107
And turn on that fight response or flight response.

325
00:13:31.107 --> 00:13:33.795
So that, as my husband often says,

326
00:13:33.795 --> 00:13:35.331
"My God, Triple Warmer turns on"

327
00:13:35.331 --> 00:13:37.421
"when you see on the computer"

328
00:13:37.421 --> 00:13:39.886
"you have just committed a fatal error."

329
00:13:39.886 --> 00:13:41.166
(laughing)

330
00:13:41.166 --> 00:13:42.489
<v Regina>It does for me.</v>

331
00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:46.179
<v ->People out on road rage, that's Triple Warmer.</v>

332
00:13:46.179 --> 00:13:49.432
But there's an energy that begins to build up

333
00:13:49.432 --> 00:13:52.920
in our bodies, if we don't get rid of

334
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.163
the cascading chemicals of just

335
00:13:56.163 --> 00:13:58.584
dealing with the stress in our bodies.

336
00:13:58.584 --> 00:14:01.325
If we can't deal with it, then we have

337
00:14:01.325 --> 00:14:03.181
less blood up here to be able to think

338
00:14:03.181 --> 00:14:05.058
our way out of a paper bag.

339
00:14:05.058 --> 00:14:09.004
And we start getting stress-related illnesses.

340
00:14:09.004 --> 00:14:14.004
I feel that Energy Medicine isn't just about getting well.

341
00:14:14.551 --> 00:14:16.833
I think the more important thing,

342
00:14:16.833 --> 00:14:20.033
is it's about evolving you body.

343
00:14:20.033 --> 00:14:22.913
So that you can adapt.

344
00:14:22.913 --> 00:14:26.859
I was so very ill, so very ill.

345
00:14:26.859 --> 00:14:30.315
I couldn't walk into a crowd

346
00:14:30.315 --> 00:14:32.128
without trying to catch my breath

347
00:14:32.128 --> 00:14:33.942
and sometimes I'd faint just

348
00:14:33.942 --> 00:14:37.248
being in a crowd, 'cause there way no oxygen.

349
00:14:37.248 --> 00:14:41.107
It's partly because my lungs were damaged from

350
00:14:41.107 --> 00:14:41.761
<v Regina>TB</v>

351
00:14:41.761 --> 00:14:42.881
the tuberculosis.

352
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:43.692
<v ->Yes.</v>

353
00:14:43.692 --> 00:14:46.988
So, I have evolved my body.

354
00:14:46.988 --> 00:14:49.803
I didn't even try to do it originally.

355
00:14:49.803 --> 00:14:51.329
I just wanted to get well.

356
00:14:51.329 --> 00:14:52.491
I wasn't gonna let anybody else

357
00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:53.558
raise my daughters.

358
00:14:53.558 --> 00:14:54.443
(laughing)

359
00:14:54.443 --> 00:14:55.531
I wanted to raise them.

360
00:14:55.531 --> 00:14:56.299
<v Regina>Right.</v>

361
00:14:56.299 --> 00:14:58.738
<v ->Amazing incentive for me.</v>

362
00:15:00.184 --> 00:15:02.061
But what I found over the years is,

363
00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:04.802
I wasn't vulnerable in the old ways.

364
00:15:04.802 --> 00:15:08.194
The things that really could get me before,

365
00:15:08.194 --> 00:15:09.218
couldn't get me anymore.

366
00:15:09.218 --> 00:15:11.415
<v Regna>So you literally evolved your body beyond</v>

367
00:15:11.415 --> 00:15:13.719
its original physical genetic blueprint.

368
00:15:13.719 --> 00:15:15.927
<v ->Absolutely, yes.</v>

369
00:15:15.927 --> 00:15:18.082
Absolutely, yes.

370
00:15:18.082 --> 00:15:19.148
My genetic blueprint.

371
00:15:19.148 --> 00:15:22.871
It's very interesting, about five or six years ago

372
00:15:22.871 --> 00:15:25.911
a physician in one of my classes said to me,

373
00:15:25.911 --> 00:15:27.468
'cause I had said that I

374
00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:30.316
didn't have multiple sclerosis anymore.

375
00:15:30.316 --> 00:15:31.873
And he came up to me afterwards and he said,

376
00:15:31.873 --> 00:15:33.430
"Donna, I don't believe it."

377
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.307
"You may have arrested it."

378
00:15:35.307 --> 00:15:39.211
"But an MRI will show that you still have these."

379
00:15:39.211 --> 00:15:40.331
I can't remember what they're called.

380
00:15:40.331 --> 00:15:44.299
Little white areas up your spine and in your head

381
00:15:44.299 --> 00:15:48.170
that show that the myelin sheath has been corrupted

382
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:49.472
over the nerves.

383
00:15:49.472 --> 00:15:52.096
"It'll still show that, because it's not possible."

384
00:15:52.096 --> 00:15:55.679
I said, "It's absolutely not only possible,"

385
00:15:55.679 --> 00:15:58.250
"it's probable, because the body wants to heal."

386
00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.627
And that's what happened.

387
00:15:59.627 --> 00:16:03.371
So he said, he took me, from where I was.

388
00:16:03.371 --> 00:16:05.525
I don't know if that was Atlanta, or where that was.

389
00:16:05.525 --> 00:16:09.781
But he took me to where he could give me a free MRI.

390
00:16:09.781 --> 00:16:11.359
Just to prove it to me so that

391
00:16:11.359 --> 00:16:14.122
I wouldn't be saying that anymore.

392
00:16:14.122 --> 00:16:17.343
And there wasn't an ounce of it left.

393
00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:19.135
<v Regina>Amazing.</v>

394
00:16:19.135 --> 00:16:22.687
This is hopping back and forth in time a wee bit,

395
00:16:22.687 --> 00:16:25.428
but when you began your healing journey,

396
00:16:25.428 --> 00:16:27.145
how long did it take you to recover yourself

397
00:16:27.145 --> 00:16:30.900
and evolve yourself back to a state of radiant health.

398
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:31.902
<v ->Yeah.</v>

399
00:16:31.902 --> 00:16:33.481
It was in stages.

400
00:16:33.481 --> 00:16:35.219
You have to understand I didn't know.

401
00:16:35.219 --> 00:16:37.107
I was taking little pieces.

402
00:16:37.107 --> 00:16:40.542
It's like I was allergic to everything.

403
00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:43.912
Even at sixteen years old, I wanted to

404
00:16:43.912 --> 00:16:46.579
be a vegetarian, but I was allergic to

405
00:16:46.579 --> 00:16:49.128
everything that grew out of the ground.

406
00:16:49.128 --> 00:16:52.754
Vegetables and fruit were like poison to my body.

407
00:16:52.754 --> 00:16:54.397
My mother had taken me to.

408
00:16:54.397 --> 00:16:58.418
A man had come to live in our town.

409
00:16:58.418 --> 00:17:02.575
That had just retired and he was the foremost -

410
00:17:02.575 --> 00:17:06.500
What is it when you work with hormones?

411
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.406
<v Regina>Endocrinologist.</v>

412
00:17:07.406 --> 00:17:08.420
<v ->Endocrinologist.</v>

413
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.774
Supposedly in the world.

414
00:17:09.774 --> 00:17:11.577
He had books and he had everything.

415
00:17:11.577 --> 00:17:13.806
He was the one who said it absolutely.

416
00:17:13.806 --> 00:17:16.408
"Do not touch fruit and vegetables."

417
00:17:16.408 --> 00:17:18.243
"It'll probably kill you."

418
00:17:18.243 --> 00:17:19.224
That's what would happen.

419
00:17:19.224 --> 00:17:22.211
I'd end up going into shock, in the hospital.

420
00:17:22.211 --> 00:17:24.301
It's because I didn't have enzymes.

421
00:17:24.301 --> 00:17:29.301
At sixteen, the only food I could eat anymore was red meat.

422
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.341
<v Regina>Isn't that amazing?</v>

423
00:17:33.311 --> 00:17:36.178
<v ->I think it's because it was protein.</v>

424
00:17:36.178 --> 00:17:37.992
<v Regina>Maybe the amino acids in it?</v>

425
00:17:37.992 --> 00:17:40.039
<v ->And the amino acids in it,</v>

426
00:17:40.039 --> 00:17:42.525
and protein is myelin sheath.

427
00:17:42.525 --> 00:17:44.423
It was like the only thing.

428
00:17:44.423 --> 00:17:47.090
I believe it was keeping me alive for a time.

429
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.879
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

430
00:17:47.879 --> 00:17:51.345
<v ->But I was also overweight and I never over ate.</v>

431
00:17:51.345 --> 00:17:52.668
Oh my god, there was nothing to eat.

432
00:17:52.668 --> 00:17:54.335
<v Regina>Right.</v>

433
00:17:54.335 --> 00:17:56.820
<v ->It's also interesting that I could eat,</v>

434
00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.122
not that I ate a lot of it,

435
00:17:58.122 --> 00:18:00.607
but sugar didn't put me in the hospital.

436
00:18:00.607 --> 00:18:04.628
But it was dairy products and like ice cream,

437
00:18:04.628 --> 00:18:06.409
natural ice cream.

438
00:18:06.409 --> 00:18:07.369
<v Regina>You could do dairy?</v>

439
00:18:07.369 --> 00:18:08.158
<v ->I could do dairy.</v>

440
00:18:08.158 --> 00:18:09.012
<v Regina>So you could do all these</v>

441
00:18:09.012 --> 00:18:10.750
heavy fat, animal based things.

442
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.286
<v ->Fat, thank you.</v>

443
00:18:12.286 --> 00:18:17.236
One of the things I really understand is that

444
00:18:17.236 --> 00:18:21.524
we are all so radically different from each other.

445
00:18:21.524 --> 00:18:24.201
And what is really good for one person,

446
00:18:24.201 --> 00:18:28.659
is not good for another, and my body needed fat.

447
00:18:28.659 --> 00:18:30.115
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

448
00:18:30.537 --> 00:18:33.811
<v ->Even though you learn and you think you've got it.</v>

449
00:18:33.811 --> 00:18:38.109
About twenty years ago, maybe seventeen years ago,

450
00:18:38.109 --> 00:18:41.075
after I was really well, somebody came out on

451
00:18:41.075 --> 00:18:44.861
television and she was really, really popular with her diet.

452
00:18:44.861 --> 00:18:47.901
She was on everything and she had a talk show

453
00:18:47.901 --> 00:18:52.124
in the afternoon, and she was all about

454
00:18:52.124 --> 00:18:54.844
how bad fat was for you and she came out

455
00:18:54.844 --> 00:18:57.031
once and a wheelbarrow of the fat.

456
00:18:57.031 --> 00:19:00.583
The amount of fat that had been in her body.

457
00:19:00.583 --> 00:19:03.476
I was mesmerized by this woman.

458
00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:06.416
Oh well, I've gotten so healthy.

459
00:19:06.416 --> 00:19:08.827
And she was saying just how bad it was

460
00:19:08.827 --> 00:19:12.097
and I decided I would go off of fat.

461
00:19:12.477 --> 00:19:16.103
Well, it took about six weeks, but suddenly

462
00:19:16.103 --> 00:19:19.100
I was buzzing all over my body,

463
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.679
just like I had been at another time.

464
00:19:20.679 --> 00:19:24.348
My body, I was starting to have hypoglycemia again.

465
00:19:24.348 --> 00:19:26.268
That I had when I was a young girl.

466
00:19:26.268 --> 00:19:30.310
It was simply because I had no fat in my body.

467
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:31.633
<v Regina>The body has to have fat.</v>

468
00:19:31.633 --> 00:19:33.339
The brain has to have fat.

469
00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:34.022
<v ->Yes.</v>

470
00:19:34.022 --> 00:19:35.119
<v Regina>The cells have to have fat.</v>

471
00:19:35.119 --> 00:19:36.026
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

472
00:19:36.026 --> 00:19:37.340
So I went right back on fat.

473
00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.385
(laughing)

474
00:19:38.385 --> 00:19:39.785
<v Regina>That was good.</v>

475
00:19:39.785 --> 00:19:43.871
So, this has been sort of a life long journey for you,

476
00:19:43.871 --> 00:19:45.865
but at some point along the way, you decided,

477
00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:47.081
"No, this is my life."

478
00:19:47.081 --> 00:19:49.076
"This is how I wanna make my livelihood."

479
00:19:49.076 --> 00:19:49.694
<v ->Yes.</v>

480
00:19:49.694 --> 00:19:52.440
<v Regina>How did that part start coming in?</v>

481
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.413
<v ->What happened was I knew</v>

482
00:19:54.413 --> 00:19:56.600
something about multiple sclerosis.

483
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.914
That I knew no one in this world knew.

484
00:19:58.914 --> 00:20:01.080
'Cause I had gotten myself well.

485
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.397
I put myself out to people who had it.

486
00:20:04.397 --> 00:20:06.189
I would work on them for free.

487
00:20:06.189 --> 00:20:08.439
I just wanted to give them some tools.

488
00:20:08.439 --> 00:20:10.946
I would do anything to make them get.

489
00:20:10.946 --> 00:20:13.314
And I would try to make doctors hear.

490
00:20:13.314 --> 00:20:15.031
Every now and then, a doctor would hear

491
00:20:15.031 --> 00:20:16.887
and send somebody to me.

492
00:20:16.887 --> 00:20:18.913
Pretty soon, I was getting so many people,

493
00:20:18.913 --> 00:20:20.353
I better start charging, 'cause I don't

494
00:20:20.353 --> 00:20:22.113
have time to see them all.

495
00:20:22.113 --> 00:20:23.788
<v Regina>I assume you were effective.</v>

496
00:20:23.788 --> 00:20:25.501
<v ->I was extremely effective.</v>

497
00:20:25.501 --> 00:20:27.062
<v Regina>And what were you doing with them?</v>

498
00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:28.054
<v ->All energy work.</v>

499
00:20:28.054 --> 00:20:29.446
Nothing but energy.

500
00:20:29.446 --> 00:20:33.488
In fact, if they had diets they were eating, I said,

501
00:20:33.488 --> 00:20:35.920
"Okay, I want you for this next week."

502
00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:40.378
"Put a piece of everything you're eating in a little bag."

503
00:20:40.378 --> 00:20:41.872
"And bring it to me."

504
00:20:41.872 --> 00:20:44.016
"We're going to energy test that food."

505
00:20:44.016 --> 00:20:44.968
<v Regina>Perfect.</v>

506
00:20:44.968 --> 00:20:48.652
Because I was very clear that no matter

507
00:20:48.652 --> 00:20:52.961
how much your body needed vitamins or minerals or herbs,

508
00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:55.287
if your body couldn't break them down.

509
00:20:55.287 --> 00:20:57.473
If your body couldn't metabolize them,

510
00:20:57.473 --> 00:20:59.649
it didn't matter how good they were.

511
00:20:59.649 --> 00:21:02.701
It's just another poison that your body has to deal with.

512
00:21:02.701 --> 00:21:03.905
<v Regina>Did you get into enzymes?</v>

513
00:21:03.905 --> 00:21:05.234
At some point along the way?

514
00:21:05.234 --> 00:21:06.901
<v ->Yes, oh yes.</v>

515
00:21:06.901 --> 00:21:09.774
Enzymes are very big, because I was

516
00:21:09.774 --> 00:21:13.027
either born without the ability to make three enzymes

517
00:21:13.027 --> 00:21:15.235
or it burned off in that first week of life,

518
00:21:15.235 --> 00:21:16.419
because I'd had a very high fever.

519
00:21:16.419 --> 00:21:17.976
Nobody ever knew for sure.

520
00:21:17.976 --> 00:21:22.976
But my body couldn't metabolize fruits and vegetables.

521
00:21:25.069 --> 00:21:27.704
Back to a question you asked me a long time ago.

522
00:21:27.704 --> 00:21:31.114
How in the world did I get into this.

523
00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:35.347
Other than multiple sclerosis, I wanted to eat.

524
00:21:35.347 --> 00:21:39.972
I wanted to make my body be able to process foods.

525
00:21:41.674 --> 00:21:44.340
What happened, working energy,

526
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.898
I really got into it.

527
00:21:45.898 --> 00:21:47.679
I traced my meridians everyday.

528
00:21:47.679 --> 00:21:50.356
I noticed what worked, I noticed what didn't.

529
00:21:50.356 --> 00:21:53.342
And I made my body a real.

530
00:21:53.342 --> 00:21:54.324
<v Regina>A laboratory really.</v>

531
00:21:54.324 --> 00:21:55.326
<v ->A laboratory rat.</v>

532
00:21:55.326 --> 00:21:57.163
(laughing)

533
00:21:57.702 --> 00:22:00.793
What I found, there was a meridian in me

534
00:22:00.793 --> 00:22:02.862
that was consistently weak.

535
00:22:02.862 --> 00:22:04.995
And that when I would get vulnerable

536
00:22:04.995 --> 00:22:07.320
that's the meridian that would go.

537
00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.763
I started realizing, that's the meridian,

538
00:22:09.763 --> 00:22:13.848
the main meridian in the body that metabolizes food.

539
00:22:13.848 --> 00:22:15.844
So, I decided to get that meridian strong.

540
00:22:15.844 --> 00:22:16.729
<v Regina>Which meridian is it?</v>

541
00:22:16.729 --> 00:22:18.393
<v ->Spleen Meridian.</v>

542
00:22:18.393 --> 00:22:22.968
It helps your body metabolize and adapt.

543
00:22:22.968 --> 00:22:26.223
It's all about adaptation.

544
00:22:26.223 --> 00:22:28.975
It sits exactly opposite Triple Warmer,

545
00:22:28.975 --> 00:22:30.042
that I spoke of before.

546
00:22:30.042 --> 00:22:31.207
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

547
00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:34.337
<v ->Spleen is not just a meridian.</v>

548
00:22:34.337 --> 00:22:37.143
Spleen is also a radiant circuit.

549
00:22:37.963 --> 00:22:41.258
It will travel the meridian pathways,

550
00:22:41.258 --> 00:22:42.676
but then it will jump its path

551
00:22:42.676 --> 00:22:45.556
and go every which way, to metabolize

552
00:22:45.556 --> 00:22:47.529
and deal with a toxin coming in.

553
00:22:47.529 --> 00:22:51.060
Try to stop a stressor from coming in.

554
00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.076
But it isn't at all like Triple Warmer,

555
00:22:53.076 --> 00:22:54.516
that is fight or flight.

556
00:22:54.516 --> 00:22:58.046
It's much more like the loving mom type.

557
00:22:58.046 --> 00:22:59.582
With love you get better.

558
00:22:59.582 --> 00:23:01.299
With happiness you get better.

559
00:23:01.299 --> 00:23:03.475
That governs joy even.

560
00:23:03.475 --> 00:23:05.940
<v Regina>Let's talk about this stress response</v>

561
00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.657
on the Triple Warmer, where we are

562
00:23:07.657 --> 00:23:09.908
stressing that out.

563
00:23:09.908 --> 00:23:12.553
Does that then effect the Spleen Meridian

564
00:23:12.553 --> 00:23:14.089
and the digestion?

565
00:23:14.089 --> 00:23:15.060
<v ->Yes.</v>

566
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.803
Which is probably why I got so sick.

567
00:23:18.803 --> 00:23:22.078
Because Triple Warmer was so stressed out

568
00:23:22.078 --> 00:23:25.672
by the fact that I didn't have enzymes

569
00:23:25.672 --> 00:23:27.603
and my mother was trying to give me vegetables.

570
00:23:27.603 --> 00:23:28.829
(laughing)

571
00:23:28.829 --> 00:23:29.971
<v Regina>Trying to be a good mom.</v>

572
00:23:29.971 --> 00:23:31.176
<v ->Trying to be a good mom.</v>

573
00:23:31.176 --> 00:23:34.290
The fact that also, again, we didn't even

574
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:36.584
evolve to be in electricity.

575
00:23:36.584 --> 00:23:39.303
We didn't evolve to be in

576
00:23:39.303 --> 00:23:42.791
any of the additives in our rugs.

577
00:23:42.791 --> 00:23:43.762
Anything.

578
00:23:43.762 --> 00:23:45.618
<v Regina>To say nothing of a wireless world.</v>

579
00:23:45.618 --> 00:23:46.684
<v ->Wireless world.</v>

580
00:23:46.684 --> 00:23:47.548
That's right.

581
00:23:47.548 --> 00:23:48.476
<v ->What is that doing?</v>

582
00:23:48.476 --> 00:23:50.012
<v ->It's doing extraordinary things.</v>

583
00:23:50.012 --> 00:23:51.985
Some people, again, we're different.

584
00:23:51.985 --> 00:23:55.366
Some people do terrible with that.

585
00:23:55.366 --> 00:23:57.414
And some people don't do as bad.

586
00:23:57.414 --> 00:24:00.753
Some people, somehow, their bodies are adapting.

587
00:24:00.753 --> 00:24:02.822
But I think that the way of the future

588
00:24:02.822 --> 00:24:06.288
is for everybody has got to evolve and adapt.

589
00:24:06.288 --> 00:24:07.835
That's what I teach in my classes.

590
00:24:07.835 --> 00:24:09.648
So that, to teach people.

591
00:24:10.798 --> 00:24:14.411
Back to foods, it took me seven weeks.

592
00:24:14.411 --> 00:24:17.078
Seven weeks of getting spleen strong.

593
00:24:17.078 --> 00:24:19.093
Getting a balance to Triple Warmer

594
00:24:19.093 --> 00:24:21.440
so that they were more in harmony,

595
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.588
that I lost my allergies to wheats and grains.

596
00:24:24.588 --> 00:24:25.793
Those were the first.

597
00:24:25.793 --> 00:24:28.673
I had never been able to eat bread, in my entire life.

598
00:24:28.673 --> 00:24:30.849
Or any pasta, or anything.

599
00:24:30.849 --> 00:24:33.430
Not the best crackers, nothing.

600
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:37.494
Seven weeks, I was suddenly scarfing down bread.

601
00:24:37.494 --> 00:24:42.494
Then, it took a slower time, but pretty soon

602
00:24:42.763 --> 00:24:45.366
I was starting to eat vegetables.

603
00:24:45.366 --> 00:24:48.193
Then the longest one of all was fruit.

604
00:24:48.193 --> 00:24:51.383
Funny, because fruit is sugar.

605
00:24:51.383 --> 00:24:53.398
<v Regina>You could do the refined sugar.</v>

606
00:24:53.398 --> 00:24:56.950
<v ->Yes, I could do sugar in something like ice cream.</v>

607
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.134
Dairy products.

608
00:24:58.134 --> 00:24:59.617
<v Regina>Where the fat was carrying it in.</v>

609
00:24:59.617 --> 00:25:00.459
<v ->That's right.</v>

610
00:25:00.459 --> 00:25:01.526
<v Regina>I had that same thing.</v>

611
00:25:01.526 --> 00:25:02.635
<v ->You got it.</v>

612
00:25:02.635 --> 00:25:04.662
<v Regina>Can't do sugar without fat, I notice.</v>

613
00:25:04.662 --> 00:25:06.795
<v ->That's exactly it.</v>

614
00:25:08.605 --> 00:25:12.533
I just, oh my god, I also lost

615
00:25:12.533 --> 00:25:15.946
in those seven weeks, I lost seventeen pounds.

616
00:25:15.946 --> 00:25:20.479
Without trying, I was just getting this meridian strong.

617
00:25:20.479 --> 00:25:23.082
<v Regina>Where does that run in the body?</v>

618
00:25:23.082 --> 00:25:24.191
'Cause everyone's gonna be saying

619
00:25:24.191 --> 00:25:25.418
where is this thing?

620
00:25:25.418 --> 00:25:26.794
<v ->As a meridian, it runs from.</v>

621
00:25:26.794 --> 00:25:28.180
<v Regina>The feet.</v>

622
00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.186
<v ->At the inside of the feet at the big toe,</v>

623
00:25:30.186 --> 00:25:32.639
and it travels up the inside of the legs.

624
00:25:32.639 --> 00:25:36.213
Flaring out at the hips, to the side of the ribcage.

625
00:25:36.213 --> 00:25:38.360
Down to the bottom of the ribcage.

626
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.917
That's how short it is.

627
00:25:39.917 --> 00:25:41.933
That's it as a meridian.

628
00:25:41.933 --> 00:25:46.136
But as a radiant circuit, and some people may know

629
00:25:46.136 --> 00:25:48.621
the word as "strange flows."

630
00:25:48.621 --> 00:25:50.946
The Japanese work with the strange flows.

631
00:25:50.946 --> 00:25:53.197
Which is the same thing as the radiant circuits.

632
00:25:53.197 --> 00:25:55.863
It's how energy will cross lines and jump.

633
00:25:55.863 --> 00:25:56.727
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

634
00:25:56.727 --> 00:25:59.490
<v ->And Spleen Meridian is a radiant circuit.</v>

635
00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:03.480
Suddenly, it will deal with metabolizing food.

636
00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.477
When those two got in harmony,

637
00:26:06.477 --> 00:26:10.381
Triple Warmer allowed the burning of calories.

638
00:26:10.381 --> 00:26:13.207
Think of Triple Warmer, it's heat.

639
00:26:13.207 --> 00:26:15.020
It'll burn calories.

640
00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:15.831
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

641
00:26:15.831 --> 00:26:17.708
<v ->It was quite amazing.</v>

642
00:26:17.708 --> 00:26:19.009
<v Regina>You must have been beyond thrilled</v>

643
00:26:19.009 --> 00:26:20.172
with yourself, to have discovered.

644
00:26:20.172 --> 00:26:21.100
<v ->Beyond thrilled.</v>

645
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.401
<v ->For your own body, but also because</v>

646
00:26:22.401 --> 00:26:24.769
you had a desire to teach and help others.

647
00:26:24.769 --> 00:26:25.750
<v ->Yes.</v>

648
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.841
It just organically happened.

649
00:26:27.841 --> 00:26:32.841
I went to, there was an accident at Touch for Health.

650
00:26:34.294 --> 00:26:37.430
I saw somebody with a t-shirt.

651
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:41.696
I had culture shock, because I'd been living in Fiji.

652
00:26:41.696 --> 00:26:44.085
At the airport, I saw somebody with a t-shirt

653
00:26:44.085 --> 00:26:45.813
with a hand right here that said,

654
00:26:45.813 --> 00:26:47.616
"Touch for Health."

655
00:26:47.616 --> 00:26:50.154
I saw that hand and I walked over to her

656
00:26:50.154 --> 00:26:51.654
and I said, I could hardly talk.

657
00:26:51.654 --> 00:26:53.350
I said, "What's that?"

658
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:54.811
She said, "Oh, I'm so excited."

659
00:26:54.811 --> 00:26:56.838
"I'm going up next week to become"

660
00:26:56.838 --> 00:26:58.790
"a Touch for Health instructor."

661
00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.568
I said, "Me too."

662
00:27:01.438 --> 00:27:04.286
She gave me the phone number to call.

663
00:27:04.286 --> 00:27:06.846
I called them and they sent back

664
00:27:06.846 --> 00:27:08.862
all these papers and said,

665
00:27:08.862 --> 00:27:10.323
"We understand you've passed"

666
00:27:10.323 --> 00:27:13.000
"all the classes and all the tests"

667
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.466
"and you're ready to become an instructor on Tuesday."

668
00:27:16.466 --> 00:27:17.349
(laughing)

669
00:27:17.349 --> 00:27:18.586
"Your class starts here."

670
00:27:18.586 --> 00:27:20.464
I think it was divine intervention.

671
00:27:20.464 --> 00:27:24.463
Because I wanted a tool that I could show people.

672
00:27:24.463 --> 00:27:26.778
And also, I needed some names

673
00:27:26.778 --> 00:27:30.170
of some of the energies that I saw and felt.

674
00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.772
'Cause I didn't have the names for a lot of them.

675
00:27:32.772 --> 00:27:35.483
They had a lot of the names.

676
00:27:35.483 --> 00:27:37.340
So, I came home.

677
00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.410
I left there on a Tuesday.

678
00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:40.777
It was an eight-day class.

679
00:27:40.777 --> 00:27:42.952
And I taught my first class on Friday.

680
00:27:42.952 --> 00:27:43.934
<v Regina>Amazing.</v>

681
00:27:43.934 --> 00:27:45.491
(laughing)

682
00:27:45.491 --> 00:27:47.325
<v ->But I taught it for ten dollars</v>

683
00:27:47.325 --> 00:27:49.320
for the entire weekend.

684
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.705
So that I could, I said,

685
00:27:52.705 --> 00:27:54.604
"I don't know how to teach yet."

686
00:27:54.604 --> 00:27:57.740
"But this will give me a lotta leeway to make mistakes."

687
00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.555
"I know something more than you."

688
00:28:00.555 --> 00:28:03.414
So, I never worried about how I taught.

689
00:28:05.194 --> 00:28:07.169
<v Regina>Now, it's a whole different story.</v>

690
00:28:07.169 --> 00:28:07.878
<v ->Yeah.</v>

691
00:28:07.878 --> 00:28:09.708
<v Regina>You're teaching three-quarters of the time.</v>

692
00:28:09.708 --> 00:28:11.394
You're away from home teaching.

693
00:28:11.394 --> 00:28:12.119
<v ->Yes.</v>

694
00:28:12.119 --> 00:28:13.516
<v Regina>All over the world.</v>

695
00:28:13.516 --> 00:28:14.583
<v ->Yes.</v>

696
00:28:14.583 --> 00:28:15.713
<v Regina>And certifying people as well.</v>

697
00:28:15.713 --> 00:28:16.321
<v ->Yes.</v>

698
00:28:16.321 --> 00:28:18.199
<v Regina>But, you must have, at that point.</v>

699
00:28:18.199 --> 00:28:19.916
Once you started learning about just some of the basic

700
00:28:19.916 --> 00:28:22.636
tenants of holding a class and teaching,

701
00:28:22.636 --> 00:28:26.582
then did you start adding in a lot of your own information?

702
00:28:26.582 --> 00:28:27.585
Your own discoveries?

703
00:28:27.585 --> 00:28:28.374
<v ->Yes.</v>

704
00:28:28.374 --> 00:28:29.899
<v Regina>You moved beyond that program, I take it?</v>

705
00:28:29.899 --> 00:28:30.763
<v ->Yes.</v>

706
00:28:30.763 --> 00:28:32.022
<v Regina>By quite a bit.</v>

707
00:28:32.022 --> 00:28:34.219
<v ->It has evolved and grown so much.</v>

708
00:28:34.219 --> 00:28:36.704
A lot of it just sort of filters through me.

709
00:28:36.704 --> 00:28:39.520
I'll stand on the stage and I'll know precisely

710
00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.099
what will help somebody.

711
00:28:41.099 --> 00:28:43.722
And I teach my classes with lots and lots

712
00:28:43.722 --> 00:28:45.877
of demonstrations, or if somebody's sick

713
00:28:45.877 --> 00:28:47.751
I'll get them on the table.

714
00:28:49.687 --> 00:28:52.215
The same goes with my classes

715
00:28:52.215 --> 00:28:54.359
as goes with my private practice.

716
00:28:54.359 --> 00:28:57.143
Nobody has ever had to pay if it didn't work for them.

717
00:28:57.143 --> 00:28:57.793
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

718
00:28:57.793 --> 00:29:00.882
<v ->Because, I know it works so well.</v>

719
00:29:02.882 --> 00:29:06.018
Yes, I know that many of the things

720
00:29:06.018 --> 00:29:10.263
that I have thought were mine, that I came up with them.

721
00:29:10.263 --> 00:29:11.842
I now know that they are taught

722
00:29:11.842 --> 00:29:14.423
all over the world and some indigenous cultures.

723
00:29:14.423 --> 00:29:17.484
<v ->It's just like, we just step in again.</v>

724
00:29:17.484 --> 00:29:21.761
And find it again, and it's an absolute joy.

725
00:29:21.761 --> 00:29:23.031
I love this work.

726
00:29:23.031 --> 00:29:24.214
<v Regina>I can tell you do.</v>

727
00:29:24.214 --> 00:29:26.358
(laughing)

728
00:29:26.358 --> 00:29:28.449
When a person comes, to one of

729
00:29:28.449 --> 00:29:32.374
your seminars, for example, do they

730
00:29:32.374 --> 00:29:34.155
have to go through a certification training?

731
00:29:34.155 --> 00:29:35.275
<v ->Oh, no.</v>

732
00:29:35.275 --> 00:29:36.107
<v Regina>Can we just have a person</v>

733
00:29:36.107 --> 00:29:37.035
who wants to learn how to work

734
00:29:37.035 --> 00:29:38.336
with their own bodies energies?

735
00:29:38.336 --> 00:29:40.075
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

736
00:29:40.075 --> 00:29:44.053
This will reach everybody at every level.

737
00:29:44.053 --> 00:29:46.880
If you just want to have a weekend class.

738
00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.994
Or sometimes, I'll just teach an evening class.

739
00:29:49.994 --> 00:29:54.175
I'll give all the tools that some people are,

740
00:29:54.175 --> 00:29:56.586
they're just sort of savvy to this.

741
00:29:56.586 --> 00:29:58.047
And they'll take those tools of a

742
00:29:58.047 --> 00:30:01.396
three-hour class and just watch it grow.

743
00:30:01.396 --> 00:30:02.505
For themselves.

744
00:30:02.505 --> 00:30:05.343
They'll step into the world of Energy Medicine.

745
00:30:05.343 --> 00:30:07.753
And start figuring things out for themselves.

746
00:30:07.753 --> 00:30:10.569
Other people will never take a class.

747
00:30:10.569 --> 00:30:12.841
Recently, somebody turned us on to

748
00:30:12.841 --> 00:30:17.438
look at this blog, and it was so moving.

749
00:30:17.438 --> 00:30:21.800
There were women blogging back and forth

750
00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:26.800
who were, most of them, double lung transplants.

751
00:30:28.387 --> 00:30:31.593
Who were giving each other ideas

752
00:30:31.593 --> 00:30:35.608
of what worked for them in the Energy Medicine book.

753
00:30:35.608 --> 00:30:37.538
Who had never taken anything from me.

754
00:30:37.538 --> 00:30:41.133
They just figured out, they could breathe better.

755
00:30:41.133 --> 00:30:44.195
It was just extremely, so rewarding.

756
00:30:44.195 --> 00:30:45.454
What we get.

757
00:30:45.454 --> 00:30:48.397
Emails that we get everyday of people

758
00:30:48.397 --> 00:30:51.096
who tell what happened for them.

759
00:30:51.096 --> 00:30:53.464
And how they were able to overcome this.

760
00:30:53.464 --> 00:30:56.941
People even with children with ADD or ADHD.

761
00:30:56.941 --> 00:31:01.932
Or an autistic child, that's able to be reached with energy.

762
00:31:01.932 --> 00:31:05.649
Because after all, energy is all there is.

763
00:31:05.775 --> 00:31:07.119
<v Regina>Can you give us an example or two?</v>

764
00:31:07.119 --> 00:31:08.697
About the autistic child?

765
00:31:08.697 --> 00:31:10.270
<v ->Okay.</v>

766
00:31:10.766 --> 00:31:14.574
There's a way that you want to have energy

767
00:31:14.574 --> 00:31:17.870
crossing over in like a figure eight.

768
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:19.843
Energy like this.

769
00:31:19.843 --> 00:31:23.416
When energy crosses over like this,

770
00:31:23.416 --> 00:31:26.296
or goes in and out from the body,

771
00:31:26.296 --> 00:31:28.525
it begins to go through the auric field

772
00:31:28.525 --> 00:31:29.944
and in through the chakras

773
00:31:29.944 --> 00:31:31.405
and in through the body

774
00:31:31.405 --> 00:31:33.709
and it will reach a person.

775
00:31:33.709 --> 00:31:35.906
Sometimes, when somebody's autistic

776
00:31:35.906 --> 00:31:40.204
that figure eight energy is crossing through.

777
00:31:40.204 --> 00:31:42.335
But it's just an energy thing.

778
00:31:43.248 --> 00:31:46.498
I've had more and more people

779
00:31:46.498 --> 00:31:49.510
learn poi balls in my classes.

780
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.654
Now, poi balls is just a way to get

781
00:31:51.654 --> 00:31:54.182
that energy crossing over.

782
00:31:54.182 --> 00:31:57.360
Holding on a string a little ball.

783
00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.941
That they start crossing the energy over.

784
00:31:59.941 --> 00:32:01.563
Children happen to love it.

785
00:32:01.563 --> 00:32:04.165
Because it's an energetic field

786
00:32:04.165 --> 00:32:07.440
that you can feel it pull like a tether, or something.

787
00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.312
And it pulls from your body.

788
00:32:10.556 --> 00:32:14.075
We've gotten a few people have sent us

789
00:32:14.075 --> 00:32:16.422
videos of their children, of how they've

790
00:32:16.422 --> 00:32:18.235
come out and how their children

791
00:32:18.235 --> 00:32:20.402
immediately knew how to do this.

792
00:32:20.402 --> 00:32:24.071
It was like, some hunger, some yearning.

793
00:32:24.071 --> 00:32:26.556
That you're out of step with an energy.

794
00:32:26.556 --> 00:32:29.533
And they can do it easier than their parents could.

795
00:32:29.533 --> 00:32:32.135
<v Regina>Right, and with the autistic child,</v>

796
00:32:32.135 --> 00:32:35.405
they'll actually start coming out of themselves.

797
00:32:35.405 --> 00:32:36.593
<v ->Oh, yes.</v>

798
00:32:36.843 --> 00:32:39.737
For years, before my book came out,

799
00:32:39.737 --> 00:32:42.873
which has been almost ten years ago now.

800
00:32:42.873 --> 00:32:45.987
I used to do volunteer work in school systems.

801
00:32:45.987 --> 00:32:50.606
Because I knew absolutely that most children

802
00:32:50.606 --> 00:32:53.251
having problems learning in school,

803
00:32:53.251 --> 00:32:56.600
it had nothing to do with their brains.

804
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.736
It had everything to do with the energy.

805
00:32:59.736 --> 00:33:02.541
Whether it was scrambled, or running backwards,

806
00:33:02.541 --> 00:33:07.541
or out of kilter, and somehow children especially

807
00:33:07.575 --> 00:33:09.506
as they're growing, and they're in a

808
00:33:09.506 --> 00:33:12.172
very linear school system.

809
00:33:14.052 --> 00:33:16.590
If their energy is not linear,

810
00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:20.089
suddenly it comes up against that system.

811
00:33:20.089 --> 00:33:22.371
The energy, literally Triple Warmer will

812
00:33:22.371 --> 00:33:24.131
make their energies run backwards,

813
00:33:24.131 --> 00:33:28.195
because it's like, this is not good for their energies.

814
00:33:28.195 --> 00:33:29.169
<v Regina>Interesting.</v>

815
00:33:29.169 --> 00:33:32.241
<v ->Somebody can teach them very easily,</v>

816
00:33:32.241 --> 00:33:34.397
how to get their energies in sync

817
00:33:34.397 --> 00:33:37.923
with the energy system of the school and learn.

818
00:33:38.505 --> 00:33:41.715
Many, many school systems I've known now

819
00:33:41.715 --> 00:33:46.077
have implemented this, because it really.

820
00:33:46.077 --> 00:33:48.605
They can prove and show that kids

821
00:33:48.605 --> 00:33:52.317
are learning better, enjoying themselves more.

822
00:33:52.317 --> 00:33:56.338
Even kids who may have been very smart in school.

823
00:33:56.338 --> 00:33:57.895
They develop in other ways.

824
00:33:57.895 --> 00:34:02.162
Maybe they're more social, or something like that.

825
00:34:02.162 --> 00:34:04.882
Wherever the energy is off for you,

826
00:34:04.882 --> 00:34:09.499
you can find a way to, and it's easy.

827
00:34:09.499 --> 00:34:11.209
I want to say that so clear.

828
00:34:11.209 --> 00:34:13.764
It is so easy and I think that's

829
00:34:13.764 --> 00:34:15.684
what people are always stunned by.

830
00:34:15.684 --> 00:34:16.761
It's easy.

831
00:34:16.761 --> 00:34:18.083
<v Regina>It's easy.</v>

832
00:34:18.083 --> 00:34:19.726
What about on the other end of life?

833
00:34:19.726 --> 00:34:21.422
As people begin slowing down and

834
00:34:21.422 --> 00:34:23.331
feeling like they're losing their life force.

835
00:34:23.331 --> 00:34:25.285
Maybe the mind's not working as clearly.

836
00:34:25.285 --> 00:34:26.170
<v ->Yes.</v>

837
00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:28.363
That's a very good question.

838
00:34:28.817 --> 00:34:31.067
Many years ago, I learned.

839
00:34:31.067 --> 00:34:32.454
(Donna laughing)

840
00:34:32.454 --> 00:34:35.547
I learned so much about teaching

841
00:34:35.547 --> 00:34:37.541
people who were older.

842
00:34:37.541 --> 00:34:39.792
I had accepted to come and teach

843
00:34:39.792 --> 00:34:42.842
twice a week to a senior citizens' group.

844
00:34:42.842 --> 00:34:46.458
In my mind, I was coming to see sixty year olds.

845
00:34:46.458 --> 00:34:48.335
I had no idea till I got there,

846
00:34:48.335 --> 00:34:50.309
that the youngest was eighty-four

847
00:34:50.309 --> 00:34:51.719
and they range to, either it was

848
00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.714
a hundred and two or a hundred and four.

849
00:34:53.714 --> 00:34:55.527
Twenty-seven people.

850
00:34:55.527 --> 00:34:56.967
My very first time.

851
00:34:56.967 --> 00:35:00.401
Here I was really gung-ho teaching them

852
00:35:00.401 --> 00:35:02.812
and everyone of them but one fell asleep on me.

853
00:35:02.812 --> 00:35:04.561
(laughing)

854
00:35:04.561 --> 00:35:09.062
My energy could not possibly jive with theirs.

855
00:35:09.062 --> 00:35:12.294
So what I learned to do, was find a way

856
00:35:12.294 --> 00:35:14.054
to get in sync with their energies

857
00:35:14.054 --> 00:35:17.542
and then their energies would come up.

858
00:35:17.542 --> 00:35:20.464
Then find out, what did they need?

859
00:35:20.464 --> 00:35:23.973
They also didn't need exactly the same thing

860
00:35:23.973 --> 00:35:25.296
other people needed.

861
00:35:25.296 --> 00:35:27.472
Like many of them were knowing

862
00:35:27.472 --> 00:35:28.848
that they were coming to the end

863
00:35:28.848 --> 00:35:32.463
of their life and they wanted to feel good though.

864
00:35:32.463 --> 00:35:34.810
Or they wanted their memories to work well.

865
00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:38.362
Or they wanted a way to take care of their pain.

866
00:35:38.362 --> 00:35:42.223
That class was one of my most fun rewarding classes

867
00:35:42.223 --> 00:35:43.823
I ever taught.

868
00:35:43.823 --> 00:35:46.564
I can cry over it, it was so good.

869
00:35:46.564 --> 00:35:48.692
At Christmas time, I'd started teaching them

870
00:35:48.692 --> 00:35:52.382
in April and at Christmas time, the month

871
00:35:52.382 --> 00:35:55.209
before Christmas, they all, people who were

872
00:35:55.209 --> 00:35:58.142
considered having Alzheimer's, or senility,

873
00:35:58.142 --> 00:36:00.990
they all made videos for their

874
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:04.520
great grand-children for Christmas present.

875
00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.327
It was amazing.

876
00:36:07.327 --> 00:36:10.185
One man had had a stroke

877
00:36:10.185 --> 00:36:14.547
and he was very unhappy, very bitter.

878
00:36:14.547 --> 00:36:17.289
One half of his body, simply wouldn't work.

879
00:36:17.289 --> 00:36:20.446
He was very upset also that he

880
00:36:20.446 --> 00:36:23.006
couldn't do the exercises.

881
00:36:23.006 --> 00:36:25.672
You know, I always make things up on the spot.

882
00:36:25.672 --> 00:36:30.672
Then turns out later, wasn't really made up.

883
00:36:30.804 --> 00:36:32.179
I just know.

884
00:36:32.179 --> 00:36:32.990
<v Regina>It came when you needed it.</v>

885
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.897
<v ->Yes.</v>

886
00:36:33.897 --> 00:36:36.521
I said, "Okay, here's what we're gonna do."

887
00:36:36.521 --> 00:36:38.856
"We're gonna put you in front of a mirror."

888
00:36:38.856 --> 00:36:40.979
"And you're going to remember"

889
00:36:40.979 --> 00:36:43.688
"what you look like cross-crawling."

890
00:36:43.688 --> 00:36:46.525
Which is simply hitting the opposite knee.

891
00:36:46.525 --> 00:36:47.730
"Just see yourself."

892
00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:48.562
"Can you do that?"

893
00:36:48.562 --> 00:36:49.544
He said, "Yes."

894
00:36:49.544 --> 00:36:51.613
So he started cross-crawling and

895
00:36:51.613 --> 00:36:53.789
his energy started crossing over

896
00:36:53.789 --> 00:36:55.090
from the right hemisphere to the left

897
00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:57.504
side of the body and the left to the right.

898
00:36:57.504 --> 00:37:01.545
Pretty soon, it had been, well maybe two years

899
00:37:01.545 --> 00:37:03.742
he hadn't been able to use that one side.

900
00:37:03.742 --> 00:37:05.438
And he was beginning to lift

901
00:37:05.438 --> 00:37:07.486
his hand and his arm.

902
00:37:07.486 --> 00:37:09.438
Energy wants to go.

903
00:37:09.438 --> 00:37:11.635
One woman, in a class I had,

904
00:37:11.635 --> 00:37:13.192
she had come to take the class

905
00:37:13.192 --> 00:37:18.192
because she had had polio as a young girl.

906
00:37:18.397 --> 00:37:20.189
Now she was in her late sixties

907
00:37:20.189 --> 00:37:23.901
and she couldn't, her hip wasn't strong enough

908
00:37:23.901 --> 00:37:27.218
to lift her leg, so she was going into a wheelchair

909
00:37:27.218 --> 00:37:28.893
and she didn't wanna be in a wheelchair.

910
00:37:28.893 --> 00:37:31.516
She wanted to be mobile.

911
00:37:31.516 --> 00:37:33.767
We just gave her energy for her hip.

912
00:37:33.767 --> 00:37:35.346
To strengthen her hip.

913
00:37:35.346 --> 00:37:37.903
At the last class, this was a three month class

914
00:37:37.903 --> 00:37:39.456
where we met once a week.

915
00:37:39.456 --> 00:37:42.592
And at that class, she came in

916
00:37:42.592 --> 00:37:45.397
on the next to the last class, with her daughter-in-law.

917
00:37:45.397 --> 00:37:48.885
Beaming, showing x-rays.

918
00:37:51.195 --> 00:37:54.639
Her nerves were supposed to be dead, completely dead.

919
00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:59.639
They had started, sprouted little tentacles.

920
00:37:59.962 --> 00:38:02.255
You could see them on the x-ray.

921
00:38:02.255 --> 00:38:05.231
She could feel energy going down her legs.

922
00:38:05.231 --> 00:38:06.372
<v Regina>Amazing.</v>

923
00:38:06.372 --> 00:38:08.921
<v ->About ten years after that class, I saw her.</v>

924
00:38:08.921 --> 00:38:10.907
She wasn't even using a walker yet.

925
00:38:10.907 --> 00:38:12.784
<v Regina>Wow, that's amazing.</v>

926
00:38:12.784 --> 00:38:14.554
What about auto-immune problems?

927
00:38:14.554 --> 00:38:16.240
Because this is really coming up a lot.

928
00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.818
<v ->Auto-immune.</v>

929
00:38:17.818 --> 00:38:20.815
Auto-immune illnesses are absolutely

930
00:38:20.815 --> 00:38:23.023
the illnesses of our time.

931
00:38:23.023 --> 00:38:26.927
Because that is Triple Warmer energy

932
00:38:26.927 --> 00:38:30.288
fighting what it doesn't recognize.

933
00:38:30.288 --> 00:38:33.102
If it has to fight too many things,

934
00:38:33.102 --> 00:38:35.630
it begins to fight your own body.

935
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:37.700
That's what multiple sclerosis is.

936
00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.161
Lupus, you name it.

937
00:38:39.161 --> 00:38:41.798
There are so many auto-immune illnesses out there.

938
00:38:41.798 --> 00:38:44.414
Allergies, all of these are Triple Warmer.

939
00:38:44.414 --> 00:38:45.854
<v Regina>And is this a result of exposure</v>

940
00:38:45.854 --> 00:38:47.688
to pretty much everything with toxins?

941
00:38:47.688 --> 00:38:49.310
<v ->Pretty much everything.</v>

942
00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:50.654
<v Regina>As you were talking about,</v>

943
00:38:50.654 --> 00:38:52.830
electromagnetic frequencies from unnatural sources.

944
00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.152
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

945
00:38:54.152 --> 00:38:55.240
<v Regina>Pollutions.</v>

946
00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.045
<v ->This is why, we don't have a choice now.</v>

947
00:38:58.045 --> 00:39:00.253
This is not an elective course.

948
00:39:00.253 --> 00:39:04.829
We've got to learn this.

949
00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:08.455
Because we are exposed to things that we never.

950
00:39:08.455 --> 00:39:10.783
Our bodies did not evolve with.

951
00:39:10.783 --> 00:39:14.622
I mean, it did not anticipate microwave ovens.

952
00:39:14.622 --> 00:39:17.129
Or any of those things.

953
00:39:17.129 --> 00:39:19.080
So you've got to teach your body

954
00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:22.352
to be able to adapt to that energy.

955
00:39:23.808 --> 00:39:25.085
<v Regina>Have you had some good luck</v>

956
00:39:25.085 --> 00:39:26.127
with auto-immune probems?

957
00:39:26.127 --> 00:39:27.012
<v ->Oh my goodness.</v>

958
00:39:27.012 --> 00:39:29.220
Well again, multiple sclerosis is auto-immune.

959
00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.212
<v Regina>There you go.</v>

960
00:39:30.212 --> 00:39:30.820
<v ->Yes.</v>

961
00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.486
In fact, for probably the first, three, four years,

962
00:39:33.486 --> 00:39:36.601
I worked probably eighty percent, ninety percent

963
00:39:36.601 --> 00:39:39.051
with just auto-immune illnesses.

964
00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:45.421
Only one person in a zillion people didn't get well.

965
00:39:46.882 --> 00:39:49.815
And it was because, and it wasn't because she

966
00:39:49.815 --> 00:39:51.532
was so far gone, because I had other people

967
00:39:51.532 --> 00:39:53.873
much further along.

968
00:39:55.201 --> 00:39:57.398
What I tell people with auto-immune illnesses.

969
00:39:57.398 --> 00:39:59.489
This is something your body has now

970
00:39:59.489 --> 00:40:01.345
learned a habit.

971
00:40:01.345 --> 00:40:04.225
You've got to kick the habit.

972
00:40:04.225 --> 00:40:06.710
That means that you can't just rely on

973
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:08.736
coming to see me once a week.

974
00:40:08.736 --> 00:40:11.563
You've got to do something everyday.

975
00:40:11.563 --> 00:40:16.563
I mean, five minutes a day, the morning and at night.

976
00:40:16.885 --> 00:40:19.712
To just turn this habit around.

977
00:40:20.942 --> 00:40:22.034
One day you're gonna come to me

978
00:40:22.034 --> 00:40:24.508
and I don't have to work on that at all anymore.

979
00:40:24.508 --> 00:40:26.183
But if you don't do it.

980
00:40:26.183 --> 00:40:28.962
And she was just a woman who came.

981
00:40:29.533 --> 00:40:32.178
She just wanted somebody to work on her.

982
00:40:32.178 --> 00:40:35.869
Same sort of idea of "Give me a pill."

983
00:40:35.869 --> 00:40:36.541
<v Regina>Right.</v>

984
00:40:36.541 --> 00:40:38.354
Didn't want to take the personal investment

985
00:40:38.354 --> 00:40:39.261
and responsibility.

986
00:40:39.261 --> 00:40:42.652
<v ->What is very interesting, about fifteen years later.</v>

987
00:40:42.652 --> 00:40:44.455
I didn't see her again.

988
00:40:44.455 --> 00:40:46.289
But one of my students, who became

989
00:40:46.289 --> 00:40:50.076
really proficient in this, she had a practice of her own.

990
00:40:50.076 --> 00:40:51.868
I heard that she was working on her.

991
00:40:51.868 --> 00:40:55.366
She was getting better and better and better.

992
00:40:55.366 --> 00:40:58.225
You can turn anything around.

993
00:40:58.225 --> 00:41:01.869
I worked in a couple of cancer clinics years ago.

994
00:41:04.222 --> 00:41:07.166
We'd see things that, believe me,

995
00:41:07.166 --> 00:41:10.141
chemotherapy is something Triple Warmer will fight.

996
00:41:10.141 --> 00:41:12.904
Radiation is something Triple Warmer will fight.

997
00:41:12.904 --> 00:41:15.016
So if you're going to go that route,

998
00:41:15.016 --> 00:41:17.480
you had better help your body

999
00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.818
be able to throw off the stress of that.

1000
00:41:20.818 --> 00:41:22.023
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1001
00:41:22.023 --> 00:41:24.882
So you have people that you've trained

1002
00:41:24.882 --> 00:41:26.108
all over the globe.

1003
00:41:26.108 --> 00:41:26.738
<v ->Yes.</v>

1004
00:41:26.738 --> 00:41:28.615
<v Regina>That are there helping other people,</v>

1005
00:41:28.615 --> 00:41:30.188
assisting other people now.

1006
00:41:30.188 --> 00:41:30.897
<v ->Yes.</v>

1007
00:41:30.897 --> 00:41:32.097
<v Regina>And so through your website</v>

1008
00:41:32.097 --> 00:41:34.250
people can find the locations of those practitioners.

1009
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:34.847
<v ->Yes.</v>

1010
00:41:34.847 --> 00:41:36.479
<v Regina>Because you can't be everywhere now.</v>

1011
00:41:36.479 --> 00:41:37.663
It's gotten too big.

1012
00:41:37.663 --> 00:41:38.825
<v ->It's really true.</v>

1013
00:41:38.825 --> 00:41:41.535
And I'll tell you, any body is interested

1014
00:41:41.535 --> 00:41:44.073
in the certification program.

1015
00:41:44.073 --> 00:41:45.993
It's just coming four times a year.

1016
00:41:45.993 --> 00:41:48.435
What is so great about it is this.

1017
00:41:48.435 --> 00:41:50.195
I am not linear.

1018
00:41:50.195 --> 00:41:52.777
My certification program for people

1019
00:41:52.777 --> 00:41:55.699
who really need to know the step by step way.

1020
00:41:55.699 --> 00:42:00.275
They take the certification program and they get it down.

1021
00:42:00.275 --> 00:42:03.802
Many of them learn to start seeing energy again.

1022
00:42:04.651 --> 00:42:06.389
They're phenomenal, the teachers.

1023
00:42:06.389 --> 00:42:08.032
We have twenty-five teachers.

1024
00:42:08.032 --> 00:42:10.517
Just in the certification program at all.

1025
00:42:11.737 --> 00:42:13.551
They're phenomenal, they're so good.

1026
00:42:13.551 --> 00:42:15.642
People love the program.

1027
00:42:15.642 --> 00:42:20.377
I only go twice a year and teach at that time.

1028
00:42:20.377 --> 00:42:23.332
They usually find, "Oh my God."

1029
00:42:23.332 --> 00:42:25.806
"It's harder to follow Donna than all these other people."

1030
00:42:25.806 --> 00:42:26.905
(laughing)

1031
00:42:26.905 --> 00:42:28.153
Who get it much more linearly.

1032
00:42:28.153 --> 00:42:30.553
It's a joy to me.

1033
00:42:30.553 --> 00:42:32.238
Really what I want people to do

1034
00:42:32.238 --> 00:42:34.073
is take it and run.

1035
00:42:34.073 --> 00:42:34.638
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1036
00:42:34.638 --> 00:42:36.217
<v ->Teach everybody you know.</v>

1037
00:42:36.217 --> 00:42:38.169
You can come to a three-hour class

1038
00:42:38.169 --> 00:42:39.598
and go out and teach it.

1039
00:42:39.598 --> 00:42:42.392
You just, whatever is, if you have a

1040
00:42:42.392 --> 00:42:45.570
bent towards this, if it is in your blood.

1041
00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:47.362
You're gonna find it fast.

1042
00:42:47.362 --> 00:42:50.306
And we also have five-day classes.

1043
00:42:50.306 --> 00:42:53.623
Which is wonderful, most people who

1044
00:42:53.623 --> 00:42:56.300
take a five-day class end up in it.

1045
00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:59.479
You just, oh my god, you find out

1046
00:42:59.479 --> 00:43:01.520
that you can heal yourself.

1047
00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:06.520
And in this world, where we are so overprescribed.

1048
00:43:09.674 --> 00:43:12.789
I think it's the last six or eight years.

1049
00:43:12.789 --> 00:43:16.042
At least 110,000 people in the

1050
00:43:16.042 --> 00:43:19.220
United States alone, die of taking

1051
00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:22.697
a medication, taking it exactly as

1052
00:43:22.697 --> 00:43:24.489
they were supposed to take it.

1053
00:43:24.489 --> 00:43:26.110
Not because they took it wrong.

1054
00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:27.902
That is, oh my god.

1055
00:43:27.902 --> 00:43:28.905
<v Regina>That's wrong.</v>

1056
00:43:28.905 --> 00:43:31.529
<v ->Yes, western medicine really does</v>

1057
00:43:31.529 --> 00:43:35.166
have to learn to see people very uniquely

1058
00:43:35.166 --> 00:43:36.072
and differently.

1059
00:43:36.072 --> 00:43:37.310
And one of the things I love

1060
00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:39.816
about Energy Medicine is it recognizes

1061
00:43:39.816 --> 00:43:42.067
people are different, so that you can learn

1062
00:43:42.067 --> 00:43:44.298
the maze in your own body.

1063
00:43:44.298 --> 00:43:45.289
<v Regina>It sounds like we owe it,</v>

1064
00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:46.905
not just to ourselves, but also

1065
00:43:46.905 --> 00:43:48.345
to everyone around us that we love.

1066
00:43:48.345 --> 00:43:49.230
<v ->That's right.</v>

1067
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:50.990
<v Regina>This information really needs to be</v>

1068
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:53.294
embraced by all cultures.

1069
00:43:53.294 --> 00:43:54.147
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1070
00:43:54.147 --> 00:43:55.171
<v Regina>So we can learn to</v>

1071
00:43:55.171 --> 00:43:56.451
take care of ourselves and each other again.

1072
00:43:56.451 --> 00:43:57.400
<v ->It does.</v>

1073
00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.659
<v Regina>Because we're kind of coming up to that now.</v>

1074
00:43:58.659 --> 00:43:59.470
<v ->That's right.</v>

1075
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:00.728
<v Regina>Medicine's failing, we're overwhelmed</v>

1076
00:44:00.728 --> 00:44:01.517
with chronic illness.

1077
00:44:01.517 --> 00:44:02.392
<v ->That's right.</v>

1078
00:44:02.392 --> 00:44:03.885
And, it costs too much.

1079
00:44:03.885 --> 00:44:04.781
<v Regina>It costs too much.</v>

1080
00:44:04.781 --> 00:44:07.128
<v ->If you learn this, I mean, energy is free.</v>

1081
00:44:07.128 --> 00:44:09.869
Learn it, and you've got it for the rest of your life.

1082
00:44:09.869 --> 00:44:11.330
<v Regina>Now, if a person can't get to you</v>

1083
00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:14.493
or get to a class, can they learn some of it in the books?

1084
00:44:14.493 --> 00:44:17.418
You're all over Youtube.

1085
00:44:17.418 --> 00:44:19.917
<v ->The books are really user friendly.</v>

1086
00:44:19.917 --> 00:44:22.029
But we also have on our website.

1087
00:44:22.029 --> 00:44:25.421
A lot of people learn better by seeing me do it.

1088
00:44:25.421 --> 00:44:28.141
So we have lots of DVDs and you can

1089
00:44:28.141 --> 00:44:30.690
just order them over the website.

1090
00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:33.197
<v Regina>Well Donna, I am so happy to have</v>

1091
00:44:33.197 --> 00:44:34.658
been able to spend time with you.

1092
00:44:34.658 --> 00:44:37.175
I'm even more charged up than when we started.

1093
00:44:37.175 --> 00:44:39.266
Your energy is just divine.

1094
00:44:39.266 --> 00:44:40.982
You're effusing this energy.

1095
00:44:40.982 --> 00:44:43.574
Going from a frail little child to

1096
00:44:43.574 --> 00:44:47.041
a person given basically the death sentence

1097
00:44:47.041 --> 00:44:49.611
by their doctor, you've done,

1098
00:44:49.611 --> 00:44:50.593
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1099
00:44:50.593 --> 00:44:52.214
<v Regina>a remarkable job on behalf of humanity,</v>

1100
00:44:52.214 --> 00:44:53.056
not just yourself.

1101
00:44:53.056 --> 00:44:53.846
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1102
00:44:53.846 --> 00:44:57.301
I do believe that this was my mission in life.

1103
00:44:57.301 --> 00:44:58.155
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

1104
00:44:58.155 --> 00:44:58.923
Absolutely.

1105
00:44:58.923 --> 00:45:00.384
Thank you so much for your time.

1106
00:45:00.384 --> 00:45:01.781
<v ->You're so welcome.</v>

1107
00:45:01.781 --> 00:45:03.435
Thank you, you were great.

1108
00:45:05.785 --> 00:45:07.712
<v ->If you'd like to hear more about Donna's work,</v>

where classes are listed.

1111
00:45:11.191 --> 00:45:12.886
You can also pick up a copy of her book,

1112
00:45:12.886 --> 00:45:15.467
Energy Medicine, at any major bookseller.

1113
00:45:15.467 --> 00:45:17.871
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
