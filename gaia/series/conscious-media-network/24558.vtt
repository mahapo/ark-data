00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
<v ->Many CMN viewers have requested</v>

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.791
that we interview Barbara Marciniak,

3
00:00:03.791 --> 00:00:06.690
who has not been doing video interviews or presentations

4
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.018
for more than a decade.

5
00:00:08.018 --> 00:00:10.198
Thus, this is a rare event to see her.

6
00:00:10.198 --> 00:00:12.478
For those who are not familiar with her work,

7
00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:13.828
she’s an author of several books

8
00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:15.699
that contain wisdom given to Barbara

9
00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.998
by a group of beings she identifies as the Pleiadians.

10
00:00:18.998 --> 00:00:21.308
We spoke with her about a vast array of subjects

11
00:00:21.308 --> 00:00:23.519
from love, to the truth about beauty,

12
00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.201
sexuality, and much more.

13
00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:29.869 line:15% 
(upbeat music)

14
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.299
I said to you off camera before we began here,

15
00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:41.540
that we need to start looking at How To guides for people

16
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.667
because people are waking up and smelling

17
00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:45.497
that something's really not right around here.

18
00:00:45.497 --> 00:00:46.087
<v ->And that’s good.</v>

19
00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:46.687
<v Regina>That's a good thing.</v>

20
00:00:46.687 --> 00:00:48.177
<v ->That's the best news around.</v>

21
00:00:48.177 --> 00:00:50.009
It means they're breaking the trance, okay?

22
00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.799
<v Regina>They're breaking the trance.</v>

23
00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:52.553
<v ->They're breaking the paradigm trance.</v>

24
00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:54.372
And, whether they know it or not,

25
00:00:54.372 --> 00:00:57.233
it is those feelings inside that are

26
00:00:57.233 --> 00:01:01.654
absolutely designed now to take them to the next level.

27
00:01:01.654 --> 00:01:03.285
The question is, (clears throat)

28
00:01:03.285 --> 00:01:05.146
now that we know that something's wrong

29
00:01:05.146 --> 00:01:06.178
and we're waking up,

30
00:01:06.178 --> 00:01:07.258
here we’ve broken the trance.

31
00:01:07.258 --> 00:01:08.588
Where the heck do we go?

32
00:01:08.588 --> 00:01:12.038
And you have incredible information on many levels.

33
00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:14.239
A lot of it is very elegant and to the point

34
00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:16.080
and it’s, Duh, why didn’t I think of that?

35
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.790
And others is much more esoteric.

36
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.311
There's knowledge of a lot going on around this planet

37
00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:21.430
that's going to be revealed.

38
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.970
So let’s start wherever you'd like to start with the story

39
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.440
in terms of how we begin preparing ourselves,

40
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.932
say, for the next three years?

41
00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:30.381
What’s going to be revealed?

42
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:31.471
How we prepare ourselves?

43
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:33.051
And what’s in our own best interest

44
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:35.600
in terms of how we treat ourselves?

45
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.517
<v ->I think most important,</v>

46
00:01:36.517 --> 00:01:37.716
and this is what the Pleiadians

47
00:01:37.716 --> 00:01:38.977
have taught me over the years.

48
00:01:38.977 --> 00:01:40.506
And the Pleiadians are, of course,

49
00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:43.037
the entities or energies that I channel.

50
00:01:43.037 --> 00:01:45.314
That we have to really make peace with our self,

51
00:01:45.314 --> 00:01:46.752
our physical form,

52
00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:49.863
and the consciousness that occupies that physical form.

53
00:01:49.863 --> 00:01:52.503
So bottom line, they always say, “Number one,

54
00:01:52.503 --> 00:01:55.270
"In order to go forward you have to love yourself."

55
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.699
And, that’s not easy to do.

56
00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Regina>It’s the hardest thing on this planet.</v>

57
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.480
<v ->Yes, and yet it’s the first basic thing is</v>

58
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.354
they say to get the car out of the garage.

59
00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:04.172
Okay? Instead of just sitting in the garage,

60
00:02:04.172 --> 00:02:06.072
and you're driving the car going nowhere.

61
00:02:06.072 --> 00:02:09.000
So basically, the exercise they have always suggested is,

62
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.659
you look in the mirror, you know,

63
00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.829
and you have a real heart to heart with yourself,

64
00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.688
eye to eye in the mirror.

65
00:02:14.688 --> 00:02:17.149
And, you start telling yourself, "I love you.

66
00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:18.919
"I love you. I love you."

67
00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:20.729
And then you start to see what comes up.

68
00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:22.350
And a lot of times people will want to

69
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.510
break eye contact with the mirror,

70
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.591
or they’ll look down.

71
00:02:26.591 --> 00:02:27.797
And so that’s the process

72
00:02:27.797 --> 00:02:30.318
of what veils and blocks do we have

73
00:02:30.318 --> 00:02:31.697
that prevent us from saying,

74
00:02:31.697 --> 00:02:33.377
"I love you," to ourselves?

75
00:02:33.377 --> 00:02:35.098
<v Regina>I bet a lot of them break into tears.</v>

76
00:02:35.098 --> 00:02:36.388
Of course, that's because again,

77
00:02:36.388 --> 00:02:38.698
as I was saying last night in my talk,

78
00:02:38.698 --> 00:02:40.778
once the tears start coming up,

79
00:02:40.778 --> 00:02:42.718
they're a form of recognition.

80
00:02:42.718 --> 00:02:45.919
And those tears are symptomatic of all the barriers

81
00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.739
that we've put there that help us forget,

82
00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.357
or that we choose to forget.

83
00:02:50.357 --> 00:02:52.839
Once we start then having the tears,

84
00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.497
we melt those barriers.

85
00:02:54.497 --> 00:02:56.599
We melt those memories and we start to see that

86
00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.138
that’s our first job, to love our self.

87
00:02:59.138 --> 00:03:01.589
Not to look for love outside of ourselves.

88
00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:03.178
To love ourselves, and then to be

89
00:03:03.178 --> 00:03:05.197
love-generating machines, beings,

90
00:03:05.197 --> 00:03:08.098
energies, bio-body suits, whatever.

91
00:03:08.098 --> 00:03:09.737
And that’s where it begins.

92
00:03:09.737 --> 00:03:12.437
And then from there, it starts opening.

93
00:03:12.437 --> 00:03:15.878
After that, you make an agreement to trust yourself.

94
00:03:15.878 --> 00:03:18.378
You make an agreement that your body is sacred,

95
00:03:18.378 --> 00:03:20.718
that your body can do anything.

96
00:03:20.718 --> 00:03:22.918
And that we're really programming ourselves all the time.

97
00:03:22.918 --> 00:03:25.018
And if we are not programming ourselves,

98
00:03:25.018 --> 00:03:26.888
then the media and society is doing it for us.

99
00:03:26.888 --> 00:03:27.797
<v Regina>Let’s talk about that.</v>

100
00:03:27.797 --> 00:03:29.279
You don’t have health insurance.

101
00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:30.268
I heard that in one of your lectures.

102
00:03:30.268 --> 00:03:31.038
<v ->Never had it.</v>

103
00:03:31.038 --> 00:03:31.898
<v Regina>You’ve never had it.</v>

104
00:03:31.898 --> 00:03:32.919
Don’t go to the doctors.

105
00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.058
<v Regina>You don’t go to the hospital.</v>

106
00:03:34.058 --> 00:03:34.899
<v ->No, I don't.
<v Regina>Except when you</v>

107
00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:36.569
had to help your Mama go over.

108
00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.078
<v ->Yes, and that was really because she was in pain.</v>

109
00:03:39.078 --> 00:03:39.738
<v Regina>That’s right.</v>

110
00:03:39.738 --> 00:03:41.789
<v ->And it was her belief, sort of.</v>

111
00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:43.088
And I said, "Well,"

112
00:03:43.088 --> 00:03:44.658
even though for years I said,

113
00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:46.370
“Mom, we’re not gonna do doctors.

114
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.218
"We can either wait in line and pay a lot of money,

115
00:03:48.218 --> 00:03:49.358
"or we can to treatments."

116
00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:50.608
And once I turned her on to treatments,

117
00:03:50.608 --> 00:03:52.258
she loves treatments.

118
00:03:52.258 --> 00:03:55.299
And treatments are really going to someone

119
00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.937
and having them facilitate your energy,

120
00:03:56.937 --> 00:04:00.279
cleaning your body, having body work.

121
00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:01.978
Whether it is chiropractic, massage,

122
00:04:01.978 --> 00:04:03.198
or really getting down to what’s

123
00:04:03.198 --> 00:04:05.719
very, very important in these times,

124
00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:08.238
is cleaning internally, through...

125
00:04:08.238 --> 00:04:10.039
Some people want to do fasting, but you know,

126
00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:12.118
colon cleanses, liver cleanse, colonics.

127
00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:15.639
All these things remove all the sludge and gunk

128
00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.238
that we're holding on to.

129
00:04:17.238 --> 00:04:20.239
So in my opinion, that's another thing that's real important

130
00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.418
to help facilitate energy.

131
00:04:22.418 --> 00:04:25.759
<v Regina>For yourself, you're going unprotected.</v>

132
00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:27.917
No HMO’s on your side.
<v Barbara>No, no.</v>

133
00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:29.297
<v Regina>So, what do you do for yourself,</v>

134
00:04:29.297 --> 00:04:32.477
just as an example to inspire people,

135
00:04:32.477 --> 00:04:33.458
to take care of yourself?

136
00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:35.057
<v ->Well, I have good thoughts, number one.</v>

137
00:04:35.057 --> 00:04:38.218
And I accept responsibility for everything I create,

138
00:04:38.218 --> 00:04:41.048
even though sometimes that's really, really hard.

139
00:04:41.048 --> 00:04:45.988
And I would start the day with a glass of water.

140
00:04:45.988 --> 00:04:49.038
And then after that, I would have a glass of Sole,

141
00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:52.758
which is a combination of Himalayan Sea Salts and water.

142
00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:56.999
It’s a saline solution with high concentration of minerals.

143
00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:58.998
So that would alkaline my body.

144
00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:00.438
And then next, after a little while,

145
00:05:00.438 --> 00:05:01.698
would come green drink.

146
00:05:01.698 --> 00:05:05.768
Some sort of invigorating, powdered usually, green drink.

147
00:05:05.768 --> 00:05:07.338
And then after that, I might have fruit.

148
00:05:07.338 --> 00:05:10.238
And then, I would eat pretty much in moderation,

149
00:05:10.238 --> 00:05:12.838
but not really strict.

150
00:05:12.838 --> 00:05:15.058
And I always bless my food.

151
00:05:15.058 --> 00:05:17.458
Meaning that I might put my hands together

152
00:05:17.458 --> 00:05:20.259
and do a Yummm over it, you know.

153
00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:22.128
But what that’s really doing is,

154
00:05:22.858 --> 00:05:25.638
I’m thanking everything that's coming into my body,

155
00:05:25.638 --> 00:05:28.199
and I asking everything I add to my body

156
00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.338
to meet my vibration or to take me higher.

157
00:05:31.338 --> 00:05:33.538
So there is a consciousness with eating

158
00:05:33.538 --> 00:05:35.278
that I think most people don’t have.

159
00:05:35.278 --> 00:05:37.058
I do eat relatively healthy.

160
00:05:37.058 --> 00:05:39.138
I’m a gardener, I grow herbs,

161
00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:41.637
I grow some of my veggies, I’m a good cook.

162
00:05:41.637 --> 00:05:42.978
I think it’s really, really important

163
00:05:42.978 --> 00:05:46.298
to prepare your own food and to love preparing your food

164
00:05:46.298 --> 00:05:48.079
because we’re putting energy into it.

165
00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:50.139
And then, to enjoy what we’re eating,

166
00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.278
and to make it a feast and a festive thing, even.

167
00:05:53.278 --> 00:05:55.148
And I eat alone lots of times.

168
00:05:55.148 --> 00:05:56.889
When my mom came to live with me,

169
00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.578
she was amazed that I would always put a cloth napkin out,

170
00:06:00.578 --> 00:06:02.598
which I think is important, you know.

171
00:06:02.598 --> 00:06:03.278
<v Regina>Yes! You feel like my sister.</v>

172
00:06:03.278 --> 00:06:05.558
<v ->I worked in restaurants for years.</v>

173
00:06:05.558 --> 00:06:08.448
Then, I always light a candle and I make it pretty.

174
00:06:08.448 --> 00:06:09.699
And, she was always amazed that I would

175
00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:11.438
eat like this by myself, you know.

176
00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:14.358
And I'd say, “Well Mom, why should I wait to go out

177
00:06:14.358 --> 00:06:15.538
"to be treated like this?

178
00:06:15.538 --> 00:06:17.518
"This is part of the ritual of living."

179
00:06:17.518 --> 00:06:19.799
It’s like, you know, my house is like that, too.

180
00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:21.159
It’s like a ritual of living.

181
00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:24.268
I keep it in order, I make beauty.

182
00:06:24.268 --> 00:06:26.318
Beauty opens our senses,

183
00:06:26.318 --> 00:06:28.169
and it makes us more psychic.

184
00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:29.958
I was saying to someone recently that

185
00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.048
that's the true meaning of art.

186
00:06:32.048 --> 00:06:34.958
To make beauty, and then to have that beauty

187
00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958
really stimulate our senses

188
00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.558
so that we then move beyond the reality we’re in,

189
00:06:39.558 --> 00:06:42.518
and we can sense our connectedness to other realities.

190
00:06:42.518 --> 00:06:45.079
Because reality is multi-dimensional.

191
00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:48.648
<v Regina>Indeed, and now this whole element of beauty,</v>

192
00:06:48.648 --> 00:06:50.399
your P-friends, the Pleiadians,

193
00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:53.599
have also talked about the essential nature

194
00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:55.158
of beauty in our lives.

195
00:06:55.158 --> 00:06:56.858
Can you comment on some,

196
00:06:56.858 --> 00:06:58.638
just kind of add some layers to that

197
00:06:58.638 --> 00:07:03.198
of what also has come through you on the subject of beauty?

198
00:07:03.198 --> 00:07:04.368
<v ->Um, let me think about that.</v>

199
00:07:04.368 --> 00:07:06.617
<v Regina>Whether it's geometry, symmetry.</v>

200
00:07:06.617 --> 00:07:08.718
You know, one thing I am curious about is

201
00:07:08.718 --> 00:07:10.138
the notion of the golden ratio,

202
00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:12.159
because that comes from our heart beat all the way out

203
00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:13.017
to everything of symmetry and beauty.

204
00:07:13.017 --> 00:07:15.198
<v ->Oh! Well that would be the golden mean.</v>

205
00:07:15.198 --> 00:07:18.728
The golden ratio would be a real,

206
00:07:18.728 --> 00:07:22.578
built-in living library formula

207
00:07:22.578 --> 00:07:24.368
that establishes a ratio

208
00:07:24.368 --> 00:07:27.678
and a basis from which reality can be built.

209
00:07:27.678 --> 00:07:30.768
One of the interesting things the Pleiadians said about

210
00:07:30.768 --> 00:07:32.639
old building that was made with beauty,

211
00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:34.158
and built with the golden mean,

212
00:07:34.158 --> 00:07:37.608
was that they didn’t just factor in this ratio.

213
00:07:37.608 --> 00:07:41.619
They also factored in the effect of sunlight on buildings.

214
00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:44.178
And that how, when buildings were constructed,

215
00:07:44.178 --> 00:07:46.508
say such as the Acropolis or something like that.

216
00:07:47.088 --> 00:07:49.819
How sunlight would, where it would touch it,

217
00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:52.258
and how it would be in relationship to the Sun,

218
00:07:52.258 --> 00:07:54.968
would also create a sustainability.

219
00:07:54.968 --> 00:07:56.317
And that if we built in orientation--

220
00:07:56.317 --> 00:07:57.538
<v Regina>A sustainability for the--</v>

221
00:07:57.538 --> 00:07:59.577
<v ->Meaning the product would last longer.</v>

222
00:07:59.577 --> 00:08:00.308
<v Regina>Oh, the product would.</v>

223
00:08:00.308 --> 00:08:01.029
<v ->The product, itself.</v>

224
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:03.539
So that whatever you were building with,

225
00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:05.498
if you used wood, or stone, or whatever,

226
00:08:05.498 --> 00:08:06.698
particularly stone,

227
00:08:06.698 --> 00:08:09.078
that by the effect of sunlight on that stone,

228
00:08:09.078 --> 00:08:11.398
using the golden mean ratio to start with,

229
00:08:11.398 --> 00:08:15.498
it would then last much, much longer in time.

230
00:08:15.498 --> 00:08:18.777
Because all of these elements of beauty

231
00:08:18.777 --> 00:08:21.037
and the multi-verse would be factored in.

232
00:08:21.037 --> 00:08:24.258
So today, we’re really blind mice building stuff.

233
00:08:24.258 --> 00:08:25.357
And it’s all money,

234
00:08:25.357 --> 00:08:26.308
and it’s all just thrown up--

235
00:08:26.308 --> 00:08:26.938
<v Regina>We’re living in modules.</v>

236
00:08:26.938 --> 00:08:28.658
<v ->There’s no aesthetics.
<v Regina>No.</v>

237
00:08:28.658 --> 00:08:29.378
<v Barbara>And on some level,</v>

238
00:08:29.378 --> 00:08:31.718
people don’t demand it because,

239
00:08:31.718 --> 00:08:34.488
I think, we’re being entertained to death.

240
00:08:34.488 --> 00:08:35.217
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

241
00:08:35.217 --> 00:08:36.818
<v ->There's so much to choose from,</v>

242
00:08:36.818 --> 00:08:39.828
and none of it has much quality or substance to it,

243
00:08:39.828 --> 00:08:42.889
and that’s symptomatic, I think, of people.

244
00:08:44.109 --> 00:08:48.358
People having lost meaning.

245
00:08:48.358 --> 00:08:49.978
Our society does not honor people

246
00:08:49.978 --> 00:08:52.408
who want to contradict what’s going on.

247
00:08:52.408 --> 00:08:54.517
Rightly so, because the media

248
00:08:54.517 --> 00:08:55.607
controls everything, just about.

249
00:08:55.607 --> 00:08:56.789
<v Regina>It's been hijacked, completely.</v>

250
00:08:56.789 --> 00:08:57.718
<v ->Yes, completely.</v>

251
00:08:57.718 --> 00:08:59.978
And none of it’s really the truth.

252
00:08:59.978 --> 00:09:02.488
So there's this sort of desperation in people’s souls,

253
00:09:02.488 --> 00:09:04.618
and they don’t know what to do and they’ve given up.

254
00:09:04.618 --> 00:09:06.539
And they've lost their own vavoom, you know,

255
00:09:06.539 --> 00:09:07.938
to be individuals.

256
00:09:07.938 --> 00:09:09.358
But that’s turning, that’s changing.

257
00:09:09.358 --> 00:09:10.538
'Cause I think people have reached

258
00:09:10.538 --> 00:09:12.278
the bottom of emptiness, now,

259
00:09:12.278 --> 00:09:13.328
especially this last year.

260
00:09:13.328 --> 00:09:16.438
It’s like, how much more trivial could it get?

261
00:09:16.438 --> 00:09:19.268
And so, there is a big turnaround happening.

262
00:09:19.268 --> 00:09:22.998
But no one can expect anyone to do it for them.

263
00:09:22.998 --> 00:09:24.398
One of the things the Pleiadians taught me

264
00:09:24.398 --> 00:09:26.687
is that no one's gonna save you.

265
00:09:26.687 --> 00:09:29.077
Nobody's gonna come through the dimensions,

266
00:09:29.077 --> 00:09:30.548
or walk through the doorway,

267
00:09:30.548 --> 00:09:31.939
or the government's not gonna fix it for us.

268
00:09:31.939 --> 00:09:32.888
<v Regina>You mean they're not landing</v>

269
00:09:32.888 --> 00:09:33.909
on the White House lawn for us?

270
00:09:33.909 --> 00:09:35.118
<v ->They're not saving anybody.</v>

271
00:09:35.118 --> 00:09:37.688
We have to raise our consciousness,

272
00:09:37.688 --> 00:09:40.378
and we have to get up and do it ourselves.

273
00:09:40.378 --> 00:09:42.017
The Pleiadians have often said that,

274
00:09:42.017 --> 00:09:44.698
you know, we’re very lazy.

275
00:09:44.698 --> 00:09:45.939
And they also have said that

276
00:09:45.939 --> 00:09:47.017
we're highly unpredictable too,

277
00:09:47.017 --> 00:09:48.439
and that’s what they love about us.

278
00:09:48.439 --> 00:09:50.338
No telling when the herd's gonna turn

279
00:09:50.338 --> 00:09:51.698
because we can just suddenly

280
00:09:51.698 --> 00:09:54.707
respond to something very intuitively.

281
00:09:54.707 --> 00:09:55.947
So what people have to do

282
00:09:55.947 --> 00:09:57.977
is they have to accept responsibility.

283
00:09:57.977 --> 00:10:02.158
Our thoughts, our feelings, our imaginations.

284
00:10:02.158 --> 00:10:04.238
This is how reality is created,

285
00:10:04.238 --> 00:10:06.158
and we're all doing it all the time.

286
00:10:06.158 --> 00:10:08.818
And the energies of these times are sort of

287
00:10:08.818 --> 00:10:11.538
unplugging us from the old paradigm,

288
00:10:11.538 --> 00:10:14.278
and whether we choose to unplug ourselves

289
00:10:14.278 --> 00:10:16.558
or whether society starts having

290
00:10:16.558 --> 00:10:19.498
greater and greater difficulties on the economic level.

291
00:10:19.498 --> 00:10:21.819
That, certainly, will unplug people

292
00:10:21.819 --> 00:10:23.458
from the paradigm on one level.

293
00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:25.797
Because they will have to become more autonomous,

294
00:10:25.797 --> 00:10:28.788
more clever, you know.

295
00:10:28.788 --> 00:10:31.438
More innovative in how they deal with the world

296
00:10:31.438 --> 00:10:35.558
and how they re-use their resources, and recycle,

297
00:10:35.558 --> 00:10:39.628
and become clever, as I said.

298
00:10:39.628 --> 00:10:40.958
<v Regina>Go back to their own source.</v>

299
00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.278
<v ->Yeah, I mean, I grew up in a very clever family.</v>

300
00:10:44.278 --> 00:10:45.818
Everything was used.

301
00:10:45.818 --> 00:10:49.329
We were innovative and everything had a purpose.

302
00:10:49.329 --> 00:10:50.357
I grew up in the '50s,

303
00:10:50.357 --> 00:10:52.018
and so we’ve kind of lost that.

304
00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:54.778
Especially as we lose our elders.

305
00:10:54.778 --> 00:10:57.278
They're leaving, our parents and grandparents,

306
00:10:57.278 --> 00:11:00.045
and they're taking great wisdom with them,

307
00:11:00.045 --> 00:11:01.345
real practical wisdom.

308
00:11:01.345 --> 00:11:02.666
<v Regina>Well, it’s up to our generation, now.</v>

309
00:11:02.666 --> 00:11:03.854
<v ->Right.
<v Regina>We are the elders.</v>

310
00:11:03.854 --> 00:11:05.405
<v ->Right, and you know we're,</v>

311
00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:08.765
those of us born in the '40s and '50s,

312
00:11:08.765 --> 00:11:12.264
we're Pluto and Leo and so we really like to play.

313
00:11:12.264 --> 00:11:14.405
We really are like big players.

314
00:11:14.405 --> 00:11:16.425
And our parents were more...

315
00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:19.545
and grandparents, had to be more practical.

316
00:11:19.545 --> 00:11:22.245
The energy of today is bringing us back to practicality.

317
00:11:22.245 --> 00:11:25.259
I think that's the name of the game in the next few years,

318
00:11:25.259 --> 00:11:27.297
is that everything has to simplify,

319
00:11:27.297 --> 00:11:29.078
become more practical.

320
00:11:29.078 --> 00:11:31.788
And those things will take people into the higher mind.

321
00:11:31.788 --> 00:11:33.498
<v Regina>And one of the things you were talking about</v>

322
00:11:33.498 --> 00:11:34.378
last night, in fact.

323
00:11:34.378 --> 00:11:35.777
I think at this point in the lecture

324
00:11:36.657 --> 00:11:38.387
you were channeling at that time.

325
00:11:38.387 --> 00:11:39.598
They were talking about all of the elements

326
00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:41.598
and you mentioned one in your own personal life,

327
00:11:41.598 --> 00:11:45.458
and that is the reconnection with the Earth.

328
00:11:45.458 --> 00:11:48.597
A reconnection with the sunlight, as grounding.

329
00:11:48.597 --> 00:11:50.437
Not only grounding, but also allowing us

330
00:11:50.437 --> 00:11:52.498
to begin going back into a state of wholeness,

331
00:11:52.498 --> 00:11:54.199
and opening our abilities, right?

332
00:11:54.199 --> 00:11:56.108
<v ->Right, I mean, I’ve always been</v>

333
00:11:56.108 --> 00:11:58.677
someone who enjoys the Sun,

334
00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:00.058
and I‘ve never said,

335
00:12:00.058 --> 00:12:03.127
"Oh, I’m gonna ruin my skin or get skin cancer,"

336
00:12:03.127 --> 00:12:03.948
or nothing like that.

337
00:12:03.948 --> 00:12:05.468
That’s a belief. Those are beliefs.

338
00:12:05.468 --> 00:12:05.928
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

339
00:12:05.928 --> 00:12:07.158
<v ->And if you believe those beliefs,</v>

340
00:12:07.158 --> 00:12:07.908
then you end up spending

341
00:12:07.908 --> 00:12:09.478
a heck of a lot of money in the system

342
00:12:09.478 --> 00:12:11.137
that is looking for you to spend a lot of money

343
00:12:11.137 --> 00:12:11.898
that they can’t fix you,

344
00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:13.388
but they want your money.

345
00:12:13.388 --> 00:12:15.578
So there's been a big campaign, in my opinion,

346
00:12:15.578 --> 00:12:17.568
to turn people against the Sun.

347
00:12:17.568 --> 00:12:18.148
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

348
00:12:18.148 --> 00:12:18.938
<v ->Absolutely, no doubt about it.</v>

349
00:12:18.938 --> 00:12:20.568
<v Regina>I was hoping you'd talk about that.</v>

350
00:12:22.298 --> 00:12:24.377
<v ->And yet, it's our source of light.</v>

351
00:12:24.377 --> 00:12:25.579
It's our source of health.

352
00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:28.678
It's also our source of energy and information.

353
00:12:28.678 --> 00:12:30.317
Because it's not just warming us

354
00:12:30.317 --> 00:12:33.597
and allowing food to grow,

355
00:12:33.597 --> 00:12:35.718
and the whole Earth to blossom.

356
00:12:35.718 --> 00:12:38.118
It’s also transmissions of information,

357
00:12:38.118 --> 00:12:40.739
and I think that's what the ancients knew.

358
00:12:40.739 --> 00:12:43.308
There's stories, you know, in history

359
00:12:43.308 --> 00:12:45.179
that talk about people who,

360
00:12:45.179 --> 00:12:47.648
when they wanted to have covert activities,

361
00:12:47.648 --> 00:12:50.468
they would always do it at night.

362
00:12:50.468 --> 00:12:52.298
And they wouldn’t do it in the light of day

363
00:12:52.298 --> 00:12:53.978
because the Sun would then know,

364
00:12:53.978 --> 00:12:56.608
and the Sun would transmit that information.

365
00:12:56.608 --> 00:12:58.767
So we came up with that expression, you know,

366
00:12:58.767 --> 00:13:01.677
doing things in the dark and keeping it secret.

367
00:13:02.217 --> 00:13:06.838
So there's a lot of truth in just casual expressions

368
00:13:06.838 --> 00:13:08.778
and casual things that we know.

369
00:13:08.778 --> 00:13:11.717
And it's the time to bring all that into focus

370
00:13:11.717 --> 00:13:14.538
and realize these things are really, really important.

371
00:13:14.538 --> 00:13:16.038
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>
<v Barbara>And so I think</v>

372
00:13:16.038 --> 00:13:19.638
a way to health is to spend a number,

373
00:13:19.638 --> 00:13:22.577
20 minutes, a couple of hours in the Sun every day,

374
00:13:22.577 --> 00:13:25.139
glancing at the Sun, acknowledging the Sun.

375
00:13:25.139 --> 00:13:28.497
Realizing that those rays not only provide vitamin D

376
00:13:28.497 --> 00:13:31.127
and sustain our body and blood and bones,

377
00:13:31.127 --> 00:13:32.958
but they're giving us information.

378
00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.758
And that information travels on light rays.

379
00:13:35.758 --> 00:13:38.237
It's so important, and it is a two-way thing.

380
00:13:38.237 --> 00:13:40.698
We can communicate with the Sun

381
00:13:40.698 --> 00:13:43.218
and just express our feelings, or whatever.

382
00:13:43.218 --> 00:13:47.117
But it is not like worshiping God or anything like that.

383
00:13:47.117 --> 00:13:51.628
I think that my concepts of Creator and Source and all that,

384
00:13:51.628 --> 00:13:54.098
they're so large that I can’t define it

385
00:13:54.098 --> 00:13:55.778
into a God, so to speak.

386
00:13:55.778 --> 00:13:57.288
<v ->Especially a male God.</v>

387
00:13:57.288 --> 00:13:58.199
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v Barbara>Because</v>

388
00:13:58.919 --> 00:14:00.638
there's always the female component,

389
00:14:00.638 --> 00:14:02.599
and that’s really another thing that's

390
00:14:02.599 --> 00:14:04.558
vastly missing from our planet.

391
00:14:04.558 --> 00:14:07.808
Is that women are awakening.

392
00:14:07.808 --> 00:14:10.288
Unfortunately, so many women think they have to

393
00:14:10.288 --> 00:14:13.898
awaken into this feminism that turns them into men.

394
00:14:13.898 --> 00:14:16.018
And they lose their beauty,

395
00:14:16.018 --> 00:14:18.569
and they lose the whole idea of producing beauty,

396
00:14:18.569 --> 00:14:21.318
and embodying life, and protecting life.

397
00:14:21.318 --> 00:14:23.638
When I think part of a woman’s role

398
00:14:23.638 --> 00:14:26.558
is to really take on that goddess energy,

399
00:14:26.559 --> 00:14:29.257
and to embody it and to value life.

400
00:14:29.257 --> 00:14:32.248
And to use the intuition.

401
00:14:32.248 --> 00:14:32.938
<v Regina>Right.</v>

402
00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:34.878
And to really make a stance in society

403
00:14:34.878 --> 00:14:37.477
about establishing beauty and fairness,

404
00:14:37.477 --> 00:14:39.499
and that all life is honored.

405
00:14:39.499 --> 00:14:41.128
And, that’s what's coming back.

406
00:14:41.128 --> 00:14:42.059
<v Regina>It is coming back,</v>

407
00:14:42.059 --> 00:14:43.678
and also with great resistance.

408
00:14:43.678 --> 00:14:45.858
Here you have ever-more expanding technology,

409
00:14:45.858 --> 00:14:48.657
very male-oriented in its expression

410
00:14:48.657 --> 00:14:50.478
and also in its design.

411
00:14:50.478 --> 00:14:53.059
And yet it affects all of us because now we’re all

412
00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:54.797
becoming dependent on those technologies.

413
00:14:54.797 --> 00:14:55.667
<v ->Exactly, and I--</v>

414
00:14:55.667 --> 00:14:58.069
<v Regina>And now we’re cut away from the Sun even more.</v>

415
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.619
<v ->Right.</v>

416
00:14:58.619 --> 00:15:00.758
<v Regina>How do you see that technological interface</v>

417
00:15:00.758 --> 00:15:04.418
as the feminine really needs to show itself.

418
00:15:04.418 --> 00:15:08.688
<v ->For myself, I stopped watching TV in the early 70’s.</v>

419
00:15:08.688 --> 00:15:10.907
That's almost 35 years ago.

420
00:15:10.907 --> 00:15:12.559
And it was a choice, it was a choice.

421
00:15:12.559 --> 00:15:15.058
Because I felt, back then even,

422
00:15:15.058 --> 00:15:17.659
that television was doing something to my mind.

423
00:15:17.659 --> 00:15:18.568
That’s why I stopped.

424
00:15:18.568 --> 00:15:21.418
I said, "I’m not gonna waste my time watching these things."

425
00:15:21.418 --> 00:15:22.297
<v Regina>Good for you.</v>

426
00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:24.878
<v ->So I do very minimal technology.</v>

427
00:15:24.878 --> 00:15:26.498
I don’t use my dishwasher.

428
00:15:26.498 --> 00:15:28.598
I don’t use a microwave,

429
00:15:28.598 --> 00:15:29.879
even though they came with the house.

430
00:15:29.879 --> 00:15:31.638
They just sit there, unused.

431
00:15:31.638 --> 00:15:34.117
You know, really low-tech.

432
00:15:34.117 --> 00:15:36.778
I use the computer for very few things.

433
00:15:36.778 --> 00:15:38.328
I have to do some of my work on it.

434
00:15:38.328 --> 00:15:40.428
I do a newsletter and when I write books.

435
00:15:40.428 --> 00:15:42.568
Setting up events and something through email.

436
00:15:42.568 --> 00:15:43.798
But it's not something I look to,

437
00:15:43.798 --> 00:15:45.378
to jump into every day.

438
00:15:45.378 --> 00:15:48.278
Because to me, I can’t wait to go outside.

439
00:15:48.278 --> 00:15:49.138
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

440
00:15:49.138 --> 00:15:50.639
<v ->You know, I live in a beautiful place.</v>

441
00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:53.478
I purposely picked a place where I had land,

442
00:15:53.478 --> 00:15:55.379
enough to manage, you know.

443
00:15:55.379 --> 00:15:57.059
Enough to enjoy and garden,

444
00:15:57.059 --> 00:15:58.768
and have campfires in my back yard,

445
00:15:58.768 --> 00:16:01.168
and sweat lodges and parties on my deck.

446
00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:03.258
And that’s how I socialize.

447
00:16:03.258 --> 00:16:07.029
I really take people and myself out in nature.

448
00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:09.308
So it really comes down to a choice.

449
00:16:09.308 --> 00:16:09.928
<v Regina>It does.</v>

450
00:16:09.928 --> 00:16:12.818
Nonetheless, if you look at the really large scale,

451
00:16:12.818 --> 00:16:14.437
you’re talking about children, in particular,

452
00:16:14.437 --> 00:16:17.548
being totally indoctrinated into the use of technology.

453
00:16:17.548 --> 00:16:18.978
And I was noticing even,

454
00:16:19.658 --> 00:16:21.988
you go to a movie, now, in a theater,

455
00:16:21.988 --> 00:16:24.858
and you'll have, unlike even a few months ago,

456
00:16:24.858 --> 00:16:26.138
certainly a year ago,

457
00:16:26.138 --> 00:16:29.038
you got your ad to join up with Uncle Sam.

458
00:16:29.038 --> 00:16:30.658
First of all, is your recruitment ad,

459
00:16:30.658 --> 00:16:31.679
followed by a,

460
00:16:31.679 --> 00:16:32.949
let’s buy this really violent--

461
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:34.909
<v ->See, I don't go to the movies.</v>

462
00:16:34.909 --> 00:16:37.239
<v Regina>nasty video game for Christmas.</v>

463
00:16:37.239 --> 00:16:41.058
Or for the holiday season, Hanukkah, for your children.

464
00:16:41.058 --> 00:16:42.419
It’s followed up with the very thing

465
00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:43.818
that’s going to program them.

466
00:16:43.818 --> 00:16:44.978
<v ->Well these are all programmings.</v>

467
00:16:44.978 --> 00:16:48.658
And the important thing about any visual art, okay,

468
00:16:48.658 --> 00:16:51.358
anything that we start choosing to

469
00:16:51.358 --> 00:16:53.667
turn on and watch for entertainment,

470
00:16:53.667 --> 00:16:55.238
our brainwaves change.

471
00:16:55.238 --> 00:16:57.958
And they immediately drop from a conscious state

472
00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.698
into a very unconscious state.

473
00:16:59.698 --> 00:17:00.918
And people do that because

474
00:17:00.918 --> 00:17:03.218
they don’t know how to relax anymore.

475
00:17:03.218 --> 00:17:04.917
No one's talking about anything meaningful,

476
00:17:04.917 --> 00:17:07.048
so they don’t know how to discourse

477
00:17:07.048 --> 00:17:10.458
or just have fun without deep inebriation,

478
00:17:10.458 --> 00:17:11.798
or something like that.

479
00:17:11.798 --> 00:17:14.398
So it comes down to people

480
00:17:14.398 --> 00:17:17.889
really getting consciously aware, making a choice.

481
00:17:17.889 --> 00:17:20.847
You know, the pictures that are put before us

482
00:17:21.697 --> 00:17:23.899
are like living dreams,

483
00:17:23.899 --> 00:17:25.778
and they're forms of program.

484
00:17:25.778 --> 00:17:28.679
So those pictures go in our brains,

485
00:17:28.679 --> 00:17:31.178
and then we think that’s reality.

486
00:17:31.178 --> 00:17:32.958
Especially when it is children.

487
00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.717
The nervous system of a child

488
00:17:34.717 --> 00:17:36.299
is not mature enough

489
00:17:36.299 --> 00:17:38.940
to handle the rapidity of the data

490
00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.520
that is coming through.

491
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.559
And I think that the speed-up of games and violence,

492
00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:45.700
and how fast everything goes,

493
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.569
and how little it is.

494
00:17:47.569 --> 00:17:49.140
Even though it is entertaining,

495
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.370
what’s happening is that it's shutting down the perception.

496
00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.539
So that, when you see people looking at some little device,

497
00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:56.279
and the picture's this big...

498
00:17:56.279 --> 00:17:57.420
I have a bunch of nephews,

499
00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.740
and when they were really little

500
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.160
I’d walk into the living room

501
00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.879
and instead of them yelling and screaming,

502
00:18:01.879 --> 00:18:02.860
like sometimes they would be.

503
00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:03.840
And having a great old time,

504
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.399
which would drive people crazy,

505
00:18:05.399 --> 00:18:06.660
but they were playing.

506
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.360
They'd be quiet, totally quiet.

507
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.299
And I’d look around and I'd say, “What are you guys doing?”

508
00:18:10.299 --> 00:18:12.509
And they're all in a trance with a little thing, this big.

509
00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:14.149
I guess they're called Game Boys.

510
00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:15.480
I never had kids, so I don’t know.

511
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.640
And they're pushing these little buttons,

512
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.690
looking at these little pictures,

513
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:18.630
and they're totally in a trance.

514
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.000
<v Regina>They're entranced, totally.</v>

515
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.820
<v ->Totally in a trance 'cause their brainwaves shift.</v>

516
00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.539
And they really have to shift to go down,

517
00:18:23.539 --> 00:18:26.040
to force your perceptions which are out here,

518
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.280
to go down to this little thing and stay there for hours,

519
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.800
and push these little things.

520
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.129
What it's really doing is that,

521
00:18:33.649 --> 00:18:35.119
they can’t see anything, anymore.

522
00:18:35.119 --> 00:18:38.190
Then they come out and they're hyperactive

523
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.609
because too much data has come in too fast,

524
00:18:40.609 --> 00:18:44.930
and their nervous systems are not developed to handle that.

525
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.380
Until children reach,

526
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.481
you know, there's these cycles.

527
00:18:47.481 --> 00:18:50.150
Every seven years it's the Saturn cycle.

528
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.390
So until children are seven,

529
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.400
they really need no media at all.

530
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.220
None. Absolutely none, none, none, whatsoever.

531
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.210
<v Regina>To play with the fairies</v>

532
00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:58.560
in the trees, yeah.

533
00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.159
<v ->They need to be shown that nature is safe.</v>

534
00:19:01.159 --> 00:19:03.040
That you don’t have to worry about spiders

535
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.159
and ticks and all these things.

536
00:19:04.159 --> 00:19:05.520
They’ve been around forever.

537
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.339
But when people set up a worry,

538
00:19:07.339 --> 00:19:09.050
they say, "Well we could get this," and,

539
00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:10.640
"They could fall off the bike so they need a helmet.

540
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.999
"And we have to put armor them.

541
00:19:11.999 --> 00:19:13.029
"And then the ticks could come."

542
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:14.350
<v Regina>Oh, and anti-bacterial wipes. (chuckles)</v>

543
00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:15.719
<v ->Yeah, and all this stuff and everything.</v>

544
00:19:15.719 --> 00:19:18.279
This, again, is people creating their own reality.

545
00:19:18.279 --> 00:19:19.860
They say, "Well this reality exists.

546
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.870
"I think I’ll put energy behind it and I’ll protect my kid."

547
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.401
And then you attract the very situations

548
00:19:25.401 --> 00:19:26.849
that you want to repel,

549
00:19:26.849 --> 00:19:30.529
because you're energizing them emotionally, with fear.

550
00:19:30.529 --> 00:19:33.859
So you can attract by excitement and conscious intention,

551
00:19:33.859 --> 00:19:36.801
or you can attract things by unconscious,

552
00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:38.400
you know, being programmed,

553
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.340
and then having the high emotionality of fear or worry.

554
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.089
Which then closes the body down,

555
00:19:43.089 --> 00:19:44.519
weakens the immune system,

556
00:19:44.519 --> 00:19:46.730
and then you end up in this cycle of

557
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.260
self-perpetuating going nowhere.

558
00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.149
<v Regina>Going nowhere, and now you have to enter into</v>

559
00:19:50.149 --> 00:19:51.920
relationships with other human beings

560
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.250
who have been equally damaged.

561
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:57.900
What have our relationships devolved to, in your opinion?

562
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.860
And what do you see us evolving back into, or beyond?

563
00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.909
<v ->Well, if you think about the model I shared</v>

564
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:05.850
about the acceleration of energy,

565
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.120
that in these years from 1987 to 2012,

566
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.910
everything goes faster, and faster, and faster.

567
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:15.099
Phase one goes ten-fold each year,

568
00:20:15.899 --> 00:20:18.191
that’s '87 to '96.

569
00:20:19.331 --> 00:20:20.381
I get these years mixed up.

570
00:20:20.381 --> 00:20:24.090
'97 then to 2006, 100-fold.

571
00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:27.080
And then from 2007 to 2012,

572
00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.800
according to the Pleiadians and the way they describe this,

573
00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.100
everything speeds up 100,000-fold.

574
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:33.470
<v Regina>Oh my God, 100,000-fold.</v>

575
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.309
<v ->100,000-fold. Pedal to the medal, it goes.</v>

576
00:20:36.309 --> 00:20:38.611
So what happens is that,

577
00:20:38.611 --> 00:20:41.620
everyone wants to cram everything all into once.

578
00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.541
So when it comes to relationships

579
00:20:43.991 --> 00:20:47.010
on a real spiritual, karmic, timeline level,

580
00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:50.000
we’re meeting all the people faster, quicker,

581
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.320
and we have to do all this stuff with them.

582
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.570
So people are being bombarded with all these

583
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:58.320
meaningful relationships that are coming through time.

584
00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.819
And they may not consciously remember

585
00:20:59.819 --> 00:21:01.021
where they knew someone from,

586
00:21:01.021 --> 00:21:03.289
but there's a familiarity and there's this sense of,

587
00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:05.361
"I’ve gotta complete this. I’ve gotta do this."

588
00:21:05.361 --> 00:21:08.190
And this is what the internet's facilitating

589
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.870
with sites like MySpace and Facebook.

590
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.159
Which I’ve never been on any of these,

591
00:21:12.159 --> 00:21:14.219
but I hear about them.

592
00:21:14.219 --> 00:21:16.330
But what’s happening is that people are putting

593
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.470
all this data out about themselves

594
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.290
and they're trivializing everything

595
00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:22.330
because they want to connect,

596
00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.210
and they don’t know how to connect anymore.

597
00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.370
And so they've been taught by generation

598
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.599
that this computer's gonna connect them.

599
00:21:28.599 --> 00:21:31.249
But a computer can’t replace

600
00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:34.640
meaningful, face-to-face relationships

601
00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.300
where you're looking in someone’s eyes,

602
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.320
or you're feeling their energy field.

603
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.620
Where you can respond to

604
00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:44.390
implication and tone and body language.

605
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:46.369
And so, of course, it’s going to be empty.

606
00:21:46.369 --> 00:21:50.221
And as people go further into relating to each other

607
00:21:50.221 --> 00:21:52.119
based only on computers,

608
00:21:52.119 --> 00:21:54.740
then we're really destroying society.

609
00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.081
We’re destroying the whole purpose

610
00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:57.579
of coming on to the Earth,

611
00:21:57.579 --> 00:21:59.730
which is basically, I feel,

612
00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:01.540
to be in relationship.

613
00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:02.581
<v ->[Regina} And, yet,</v>

614
00:22:04.001 --> 00:22:05.840
hopefully as a progression from there,

615
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.759
you see that technology may start taking a dive here,

616
00:22:08.759 --> 00:22:09.741
in the next few years,

617
00:22:09.741 --> 00:22:11.841
and that’s gonna change our potential.

618
00:22:11.841 --> 00:22:12.600
<v ->Oh, absolutely! Absolutely.</v>

619
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.729
You know, I do study Astrology as sort of a reality check.

620
00:22:15.729 --> 00:22:18.260
And I mentioned last night that the Pleiadians

621
00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.690
suggested that I study Astrology

622
00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:21.720
after I first started channeling.

623
00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.480
And also, they said to get Rolfed.

624
00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.320
You know, get my body lined up.

625
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.370
I had a Rolf's work.

626
00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.420
And to use a crystal.

627
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.530
So I did study astrology and I have for 20 years now,

628
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.060
and I just use it as a tool.

629
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.179
Because sometimes the Pleiadians would say things

630
00:22:35.179 --> 00:22:37.310
and I would think, "Oh, I don’t know.

631
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:39.290
"This sounds so far-fetched."

632
00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.260
But as I started studying astrology,

633
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:45.321
I could see where the cosmic weather was going.

634
00:22:45.321 --> 00:22:47.421
And I could see where these cycles were leading us

635
00:22:47.421 --> 00:22:48.779
by studying history,

636
00:22:48.779 --> 00:22:50.680
when these things had happened before.

637
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.260
And then based on my intuition

638
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.070
and what people were showing me now.

639
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:56.100
So we are going to turn all this around

640
00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.059
because if we don’t,

641
00:22:57.059 --> 00:22:58.471
and let me say this.

642
00:22:58.471 --> 00:23:00.531
Not everyone will turn this around.

643
00:23:00.531 --> 00:23:03.279
There will be those who will proceed

644
00:23:03.279 --> 00:23:05.800
into this technological future.

645
00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.580
And it’s not gonna be pretty,

646
00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.730
because they'll end up destroying the body.

647
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:11.830
The body can’t handle the energy.

648
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.409
<v Regina>Can you talk about that?</v>

649
00:23:13.409 --> 00:23:15.490
Even the astrological indications,

650
00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.180
so the basis for this that you’ve seen and been shown?

651
00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:22.210
<v ->Well the planet Uranus is in Pisces right now,</v>

652
00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:25.020
and it always brings innovation.

653
00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.370
Last night I mentioned that Uranus and Pluto

654
00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:30.979
were conjunct in the '60s in the sign of Virgo,

655
00:23:30.979 --> 00:23:33.630
and that brought this great revolution out,

656
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.141
which was played out in all kinds of ways.

657
00:23:35.141 --> 00:23:38.840
But basically, we had generational break very quickly.

658
00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.860
And, of course, there was lots of other elements involved

659
00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.979
attempting to control the astrological weather,

660
00:23:43.979 --> 00:23:47.220
or steer the masses into a container,

661
00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.800
rather than let the masses

662
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.939
organically respond to this energy.

663
00:23:50.939 --> 00:23:52.300
But it was a break-away energy.

664
00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.130
It was a definite revolution.

665
00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:57.519
Well we’re in a much bigger phase of revolution now.

666
00:23:57.519 --> 00:23:59.890
The cycles are much larger.

667
00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:01.460
Because everything's faster and faster,

668
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.200
it means it's not gonna take a revolutionary cycle

669
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.860
to unfold over 20 years after a stimulation point.

670
00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.010
It can unfold in weeks, in days.

671
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.399
We're right sitting at that cusp, now.

672
00:24:12.399 --> 00:24:13.389
And so big, big changes are coming.

673
00:24:13.389 --> 00:24:15.281
<v Regina>How does this effect technology,</v>

674
00:24:15.281 --> 00:24:17.100
as you were mentioning it?
<v Barbara>- I think that</v>

675
00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.060
the point that got stimulated in the '60s

676
00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.279
is gonna be re-stimulated in 2010.

677
00:24:25.279 --> 00:24:27.419
So that means that all of us that were

678
00:24:27.419 --> 00:24:28.660
around in the '60s--

679
00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:29.330
<v Regina>Protesting.</v>

680
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.440
<v ->Yeah, protesting, and expanding our minds,</v>

681
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.270
and breaking open the head, and all this stuff.

682
00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:36.190
And really exploring what we were.

683
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.879
Now it's gonna re-stimulate all of us

684
00:24:39.879 --> 00:24:41.789
because it makes an aspect that says,

685
00:24:41.789 --> 00:24:43.159
"Okay, now you have to really take,

686
00:24:43.159 --> 00:24:44.959
and do something with that."

687
00:24:44.959 --> 00:24:46.911
So worldwide revolution is coming.

688
00:24:46.911 --> 00:24:47.700
There is no doubt about it.

689
00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.940
<v Regina>Do you see that happening in the U.S. political--</v>

690
00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.140
<v ->I see it all over the world.</v>

691
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.260
I see it all over the world.

692
00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.350
I see political collapse, eventually,

693
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.520
all over the world.

694
00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.251
And as they Pleiadians would say,

695
00:24:57.251 --> 00:24:59.179
"It’s all by agreement."

696
00:24:59.179 --> 00:25:01.540
It will be bring chaos, there's no doubt about it.

697
00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.979
But in order to build something new,

698
00:25:03.979 --> 00:25:05.599
and for something new to come out,

699
00:25:05.599 --> 00:25:07.279
something has to crumble.

700
00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:09.640
And sometimes it is literal crumbling.

701
00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.049
Sometimes it’s simply, things just stop working.

702
00:25:13.049 --> 00:25:14.600
And you can see we’re in this,

703
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.069
everything’s not working anymore.

704
00:25:16.069 --> 00:25:18.029
Why isn't it working?

705
00:25:18.029 --> 00:25:21.080
Because people are so corrupt.

706
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.771
They're so corrupt, everything...

707
00:25:25.321 --> 00:25:26.321
<v Regina>True.</v>

708
00:25:26.751 --> 00:25:28.860
<v ->And it’s a choice that we all have to face.</v>

709
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.029
We all get this.

710
00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:31.310
It’s like, somebody'll say to you,

711
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.080
"Well if you do this, you know,

712
00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.280
"then you can get this."

713
00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.920
And then you say, "Wow! Okay."

714
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:38.859
It looks like a way to get ahead.

715
00:25:38.859 --> 00:25:39.839
And then eventually they say,

716
00:25:39.839 --> 00:25:41.369
"Well, I helped you do this, this, and this.

717
00:25:41.369 --> 00:25:43.580
"So now I want this favor back."

718
00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:45.280
And you say, "I don’t want to do this."

719
00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.800
And then they go, "Oh, okay."

720
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.180
You know, and then you get set up.

721
00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.830
I mean, I haven't, but I can see how it works.

722
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:53.349
And then people set people up for

723
00:25:53.349 --> 00:25:55.850
blackmail, corruption, and it gets really nasty.

724
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.080
<v Regina>Which is common in Congress.</v>

725
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.380
<v ->It’s so common all over the world,</v>

726
00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.540
that it's very, very sad.

727
00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:06.520
So then we have this level of corruption world-wide

728
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.950
that’s basically caught up in blackmail schemes.

729
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:12.879
And those blackmail schemes always go back to two issues.

730
00:26:12.879 --> 00:26:14.100
Money and sex.

731
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.061
And the misuse of money and the misuse of sex.

732
00:26:16.061 --> 00:26:18.680
They're always first, second chakra issues.

733
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.479
How can I survive?

734
00:26:19.479 --> 00:26:21.410
What am I gonna do with my sexuality?

735
00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:23.459
So that’s something that really has to change,

736
00:26:23.459 --> 00:26:26.119
is that people are valuing their sexuality.

737
00:26:26.119 --> 00:26:27.940
<v Regina>Right, and so the rise of porn</v>

738
00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.209
is not a good thing for the human psyche, you're saying?

739
00:26:30.209 --> 00:26:31.190
<v ->No, it's horrible.</v>

740
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:32.790
Because what happens is that

741
00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:35.300
this rise of porn

742
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.090
is a replacement for real relationships.

743
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:40.239
And I read something very interesting.

744
00:26:40.239 --> 00:26:43.199
That, along with the rise of porn,

745
00:26:43.199 --> 00:26:44.289
in men anyways,

746
00:26:44.289 --> 00:26:47.520
there's also an equal rise of sexual dysfunction.

747
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.729
I think they call it erectile dysfunction.

748
00:26:48.729 --> 00:26:49.610
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

749
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:52.020
<v ->So the more men are looking for stimulation</v>

750
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.089
that's not real, outside themselves,

751
00:26:54.089 --> 00:26:56.760
the less they are able to have fulfilling relationships.

752
00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.710
<v Regina>But this works for the drug companies.</v>

753
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.040
<v ->Well the drug companies, yes.</v>

754
00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:04.559
$35 billion, $35 billion is the recent figure,

755
00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:08.650
and they expect it to go to $50 billion by 2010.

756
00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:12.540
Now what this is saying on a real symbolic level

757
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.560
is that something's happening with people,

758
00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.240
and they don’t know what it is.

759
00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.851
So they go to a doctor,

760
00:27:17.851 --> 00:27:19.571
and the doctor is just,

761
00:27:19.571 --> 00:27:21.551
he's just a factory worker, that's all he is.

762
00:27:21.551 --> 00:27:22.199
I mean, no offense,

763
00:27:22.199 --> 00:27:24.699
but we’re all just factory workers.

764
00:27:24.699 --> 00:27:26.019
You come out of college, you come out of school,

765
00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:27.249
I don’t care how many degrees you have

766
00:27:27.249 --> 00:27:28.200
and how much you paid for it.

767
00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.000
We’re just a factory worker

768
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.620
fulfilling someone else’s agenda to make money,

769
00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.420
and to keep people locked into something,

770
00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.730
the services that have no heart.

771
00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:38.961
So these people come in and the doctors aren’t psychic.

772
00:27:38.961 --> 00:27:40.121
They're not trained to be psychic.

773
00:27:40.121 --> 00:27:41.610
They don’t have time, they don’t care.

774
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:44.320
They don't say, "What’s really going on?"

775
00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.960
They don’t wanna look in the soul.

776
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.440
So then it’s all these drugs.

777
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.979
And people get on drugs,

778
00:27:48.979 --> 00:27:51.039
and then they don’t know what’s going on,

779
00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:52.480
and they vacate their body

780
00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.960
and then this is where we get into entity possession.

781
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.919
Drugs can lead to entity possession,

782
00:27:56.919 --> 00:27:59.280
and pornography leads to entity possession.

783
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.269
Because what happens when you lower your vibration

784
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:05.631
and your values sexually, okay.

785
00:28:05.631 --> 00:28:10.370
Then you have sex based on these activities,

786
00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:11.459
what I call funky sex.

787
00:28:11.459 --> 00:28:14.639
You know, without love and without real significance,

788
00:28:14.639 --> 00:28:16.180
and it goes way down from there.

789
00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.060
<v Regina>Right.</v>

790
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.960
<v ->You open yourself wide to other entities to come in,</v>

791
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.479
that want human bodies

792
00:28:23.479 --> 00:28:26.980
to engage in these perverse activities.

793
00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.979
And they're harmful and they're demeaning.

794
00:28:29.979 --> 00:28:32.560
And the important thing that people must really understand

795
00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.840
is that sex is psychic energy.

796
00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.040
It's powerful psychic energy.

797
00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.919
Used at a very high level,

798
00:28:39.919 --> 00:28:41.670
two people can generate

799
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:45.040
so much sexual energy and psychic energy,

800
00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.620
that they can remote view during sex.

801
00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.241
They can go heal the world and change things.

802
00:28:50.241 --> 00:28:51.800
This is sort of a lost art,

803
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.859
and we hide it under tantra and all these things,

804
00:28:54.859 --> 00:28:56.530
and think it has to be all these exercises

805
00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:58.690
and magical performing and everything.

806
00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:00.760
It really has to do more with two people’s intention.

807
00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:01.869
<v Regina>It's more essential, yeah.</v>

808
00:29:01.869 --> 00:29:05.000
<v ->Of trust, and heart, and eye contact,</v>

809
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.720
because so much gets shared through the eyes.

810
00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.570
So on some level,

811
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:12.639
pornography's coming up because it has to be cleansed.

812
00:29:12.639 --> 00:29:14.959
It's an old, ancient issue.

813
00:29:14.959 --> 00:29:16.380
The debasement of the human body.

814
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.120
Using children, animals,

815
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.220
controlling people this way.

816
00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.040
This is so old.

817
00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:24.019
So as we’re changing the paradigm,

818
00:29:24.019 --> 00:29:25.940
everything that's not working,

819
00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.090
that's really dark and nasty,

820
00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.160
it's got to come up to be identified.

821
00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.540
This whole idea of,

822
00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.029
well, we’re gonna get ascended and

823
00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:35.939
we're gonna lift our consciousness in love and light,

824
00:29:35.939 --> 00:29:37.479
and we don’t have to know about all this stuff.

825
00:29:37.479 --> 00:29:40.619
'Cause I’ve taught very difficult things over the years,

826
00:29:40.619 --> 00:29:42.810
and I’ve taken a lot of flak for it.

827
00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:44.860
People years ago used to say, "Barbara Marciniak.

828
00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.299
"Wow, she’s getting really dark."

829
00:29:46.299 --> 00:29:47.739
And, “Is she working with the Devil?”

830
00:29:47.739 --> 00:29:49.529
And all this stuff, and I'd say, "Wow!

831
00:29:49.529 --> 00:29:51.219
"Are these people are in denial."

832
00:29:51.219 --> 00:29:53.120
That if you don’t use light words

833
00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.700
and things of all beauty and upliftment,

834
00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.620
people are afraid.

835
00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:00.639
And yet, if we don’t go there and address it,

836
00:30:00.639 --> 00:30:01.810
it can never be healed.

837
00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:04.469
It’s like, think about leprosy,

838
00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:06.680
how horrible it was, historically.

839
00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.690
People didn’t want to look,

840
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:09.840
and they banned the lepers and everything.

841
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.730
It wasn’t until Father Damian on Molokai,

842
00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:14.959
that he made a home for the lepers,

843
00:30:14.959 --> 00:30:15.769
and he looked at them,

844
00:30:15.769 --> 00:30:16.980
and then people could address it

845
00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.560
and they could start healing it.

846
00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.350
So we have to look at what’s not working,

847
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.980
even if people think they're enjoying it.

848
00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:24.911
Because the entity--

849
00:30:24.911 --> 00:30:26.271
<v Regina>It’s popping up all around, anyway.</v>

850
00:30:26.271 --> 00:30:28.961
<v ->The entity possession is going to get worse and worse.</v>

851
00:30:28.961 --> 00:30:31.951
And one of the reasons is this.

852
00:30:31.951 --> 00:30:33.030
That...

853
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:35.150
there are beings on the planet, human.

854
00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:36.269
Or they have a human body.

855
00:30:36.269 --> 00:30:37.359
I don’t know how human they are,

856
00:30:37.359 --> 00:30:39.780
but they operate with a physical form.

857
00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.779
And they understand some of the oldest arts of the planet,

858
00:30:42.779 --> 00:30:46.239
which I guess you would call magical arts.

859
00:30:46.239 --> 00:30:48.029
It's like a magical intelligence.

860
00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:52.259
And these arts can be used for good, or ill.

861
00:30:52.259 --> 00:30:53.960
And they use them for ill.

862
00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:59.080
When you perform acts of intention

863
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.040
at times of power,

864
00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:04.300
then you can affect, you can condition space.

865
00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.638
And anything that's done on the solstices, the equinoxes,

866
00:31:07.638 --> 00:31:09.087
the cross-quarters,

867
00:31:09.087 --> 00:31:10.096
which are the half way point

868
00:31:10.096 --> 00:31:12.266
between the solstice and equinoxes,

869
00:31:12.266 --> 00:31:13.847
and the new moons and the full moons.

870
00:31:13.847 --> 00:31:17.287
Any kind of ceremonial activity that's done at that time

871
00:31:17.287 --> 00:31:19.468
can really condition the whole Earth.

872
00:31:19.468 --> 00:31:22.217
Especially if somebody really knows what they're doing,

873
00:31:22.217 --> 00:31:25.407
and they want to dedicate a certain activity

874
00:31:25.407 --> 00:31:27.427
such as 9/11, for example.

875
00:31:27.427 --> 00:31:32.427
Let's stage a 9/11, this mass ritual sacrifice of people,

876
00:31:32.447 --> 00:31:35.967
and let’s broadcast it and tell everyone that it's this.

877
00:31:35.967 --> 00:31:37.087
And then what happens is,

878
00:31:37.087 --> 00:31:38.777
on some level we think, "Oh my God!"

879
00:31:38.777 --> 00:31:40.897
You know, I didn’t. I knew right away.

880
00:31:40.897 --> 00:31:42.237
As soon as it happened,

881
00:31:42.237 --> 00:31:43.967
because of my intuition, my work,

882
00:31:43.967 --> 00:31:45.477
I knew exactly what it was.

883
00:31:45.477 --> 00:31:47.258
I knew it was a staged event,

884
00:31:47.258 --> 00:31:50.178
and I knew it was an attempt to sell fear.

885
00:31:50.568 --> 00:31:52.417
And more than that, what the Pleiadians said,

886
00:31:52.417 --> 00:31:56.007
"It was an attempt by global elite, using media,

887
00:31:56.007 --> 00:32:00.187
"to get everybody’s attention into one probable reality.

888
00:32:00.187 --> 00:32:03.298
"And in that probable reality, then they dedicated,

889
00:32:03.298 --> 00:32:06.887
"or they would dedicate a 9/11, or a Waco,

890
00:32:06.887 --> 00:32:09.327
"or an Oklahoma City, or any of these events,

891
00:32:09.327 --> 00:32:11.327
"any of the wars, any of the skirmishes,

892
00:32:11.327 --> 00:32:14.128
"would be dedicated by some beings,

893
00:32:14.128 --> 00:32:16.627
"some humans, to non-physical forces."

894
00:32:17.027 --> 00:32:20.737
They would say, "Here, we are offering you this life form."

895
00:32:20.737 --> 00:32:22.727
And you'd say, "Well, why is that important?"

896
00:32:22.727 --> 00:32:26.187
One of the things I’ve learned is that

897
00:32:26.187 --> 00:32:28.428
beings from other dimensions

898
00:32:28.428 --> 00:32:30.867
are very attracted to us by natural.

899
00:32:30.867 --> 00:32:31.597
This is natural.

900
00:32:31.597 --> 00:32:33.047
We flow in and out.

901
00:32:33.047 --> 00:32:35.887
And they're attracted to our life force and our vibration.

902
00:32:35.887 --> 00:32:38.048
And this is why, historically,

903
00:32:38.048 --> 00:32:40.667
virgins would be offered for sacrifice.

904
00:32:40.667 --> 00:32:41.888
Young children, virgins,

905
00:32:41.888 --> 00:32:43.957
because they had very pure energy.

906
00:32:43.957 --> 00:32:46.796
And when a body would be sacrificed,

907
00:32:46.796 --> 00:32:48.367
and the blood offered,

908
00:32:48.367 --> 00:32:49.966
the entities would just come pouring in

909
00:32:49.966 --> 00:32:51.817
because it’s food for them.

910
00:32:51.817 --> 00:32:54.317
So we have to counteract that.

911
00:32:54.317 --> 00:32:57.046
And part of my work has been to teach people

912
00:32:57.046 --> 00:32:59.426
to honor those times when the energies

913
00:32:59.426 --> 00:33:00.996
between heaven and Earth,

914
00:33:00.996 --> 00:33:03.466
cosmic and ourselves, flow.

915
00:33:03.466 --> 00:33:05.647
They really flow, like a Niagara Falls.

916
00:33:05.647 --> 00:33:08.426
And it’s our job to give thanks,

917
00:33:08.426 --> 00:33:11.176
and to pray, and to have gratitude.

918
00:33:12.726 --> 00:33:14.916
And to really condition what we want

919
00:33:14.916 --> 00:33:17.617
and set this season ahead by intention.

920
00:33:17.617 --> 00:33:19.957
And that’s the way we have to counter-act this.

921
00:33:19.957 --> 00:33:23.047
So it’s all sort of playing with the same materials,

922
00:33:23.047 --> 00:33:24.937
it’s just comes down to intentionality.

923
00:33:24.937 --> 00:33:28.488
<v Regina>And creating a new sense of values.</v>

924
00:33:28.488 --> 00:33:29.197
Real values.

925
00:33:29.197 --> 00:33:32.957
<v ->Yeah, and, I think people learn about values by example,</v>

926
00:33:32.957 --> 00:33:34.637
and certainly by role model.

927
00:33:34.637 --> 00:33:37.257
And when they see that someone has the courage to say,

928
00:33:37.257 --> 00:33:38.397
“The Emperor has no clothes,”

929
00:33:38.397 --> 00:33:40.506
then they may want to say it, too.

930
00:33:40.506 --> 00:33:43.176
We’re gonna be doing a lot of that, a lot.

931
00:33:43.556 --> 00:33:47.156
Astrologically, there's gonna be a lot of hard things

932
00:33:47.156 --> 00:33:50.547
that we’re gonna have to integrate.

933
00:33:50.547 --> 00:33:54.506
The people will because we’ve placed our belief and trust

934
00:33:54.506 --> 00:33:58.487
in something, people, situations, institutions,

935
00:33:58.487 --> 00:34:00.838
that don’t honor that trust.

936
00:34:00.838 --> 00:34:02.368
And yet, pretend they do.

937
00:34:02.368 --> 00:34:04.617
So this becomes a shock to people

938
00:34:04.617 --> 00:34:06.257
because we are trusting beings.

939
00:34:06.257 --> 00:34:08.897
We are really pretty good at heart, most of us.

940
00:34:08.897 --> 00:34:10.697
And so we project, "Oh, I wouldn't do this,

941
00:34:10.697 --> 00:34:12.656
"so nobody else would ever do this."

942
00:34:12.656 --> 00:34:15.976
And that’s part of the credibility of these global elite,

943
00:34:15.976 --> 00:34:19.177
is they know that, they all study psychology.

944
00:34:19.177 --> 00:34:20.857
They understand behavioral modification,

945
00:34:20.857 --> 00:34:22.306
they understand spirits,

946
00:34:22.306 --> 00:34:23.676
they understand astrology,

947
00:34:23.676 --> 00:34:24.916
they understand the whole scoop.

948
00:34:24.916 --> 00:34:26.597
They're occult practitioners

949
00:34:26.597 --> 00:34:28.077
and they know the story of the planet.

950
00:34:28.077 --> 00:34:31.336
They know the cycles, so they manipulate us.

951
00:34:31.336 --> 00:34:33.167
And the bigger question is,

952
00:34:33.167 --> 00:34:34.237
we have to ask ourselves,

953
00:34:34.237 --> 00:34:36.517
"If we create our own reality, individually,

954
00:34:36.517 --> 00:34:39.737
"and as a mass agreement,

955
00:34:39.737 --> 00:34:41.237
"why have we created this?"

956
00:34:41.237 --> 00:34:41.946
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

957
00:34:41.946 --> 00:34:43.465
<v Both>That's the big question.</v>

958
00:34:43.465 --> 00:34:45.036
<v ->It’s not like, let’s go after these people,</v>

959
00:34:45.036 --> 00:34:48.747
and can we hold new Nuremberg trials,

960
00:34:48.747 --> 00:34:51.797
and can we get all indignant about what they're doing?

961
00:34:51.797 --> 00:34:53.957
Well, you can waste your time doing that,

962
00:34:53.957 --> 00:34:55.617
but what’s the bigger picture here?

963
00:34:55.617 --> 00:35:00.217
Why have we, as a race of human beings,

964
00:35:00.217 --> 00:35:02.677
created this tyranny on our planet?

965
00:35:02.677 --> 00:35:05.417
And why is it that it is so pervasive

966
00:35:05.417 --> 00:35:07.417
that people are afraid to even see it?

967
00:35:07.417 --> 00:35:10.386
Or they don’t even think they have power to overcome it?

968
00:35:10.386 --> 00:35:13.626
So those are some really pressing questions.

969
00:35:13.626 --> 00:35:15.697
Really pressing issues.

970
00:35:15.697 --> 00:35:16.997
<v Regina>And we’re gonna be looking at all of them</v>

971
00:35:16.997 --> 00:35:18.357
in the next few years.

972
00:35:18.357 --> 00:35:20.976
<v ->And you will see more people come out.</v>

973
00:35:20.976 --> 00:35:25.347
You will see more people who know how to manage this energy.

974
00:35:25.347 --> 00:35:27.277
I’ve been doing my work, officially,

975
00:35:27.277 --> 00:35:29.177
for 20 years with the Pleiadians.

976
00:35:29.177 --> 00:35:32.577
So what I see from doing my work for the last 20 years,

977
00:35:32.577 --> 00:35:35.427
is that people who are willing to learn,

978
00:35:35.427 --> 00:35:37.477
and willing to change their beliefs,

979
00:35:37.477 --> 00:35:38.786
and willing to face up to,

980
00:35:38.786 --> 00:35:41.796
"Wow! I really created this and what can I do?

981
00:35:41.796 --> 00:35:42.946
"What’s the point of it?

982
00:35:42.946 --> 00:35:45.436
"What lesson can I get and how can I move on?"

983
00:35:45.436 --> 00:35:47.638
These people are getting really strong.

984
00:35:47.638 --> 00:35:49.227
They're getting really smart.

985
00:35:49.227 --> 00:35:50.777
They're totally intuitive.

986
00:35:50.777 --> 00:35:52.437
They are not...

987
00:35:52.437 --> 00:35:54.647
Most of the time they can’t be fleeced, anymore.

988
00:35:54.647 --> 00:35:55.798
Where before, they used to say,

989
00:35:55.798 --> 00:35:56.956
"Oh, isn’t this person great!"

990
00:35:56.956 --> 00:35:57.746
Or, "Look at this."

991
00:35:57.746 --> 00:35:58.636
They were so naive.

992
00:35:58.636 --> 00:36:00.887
And now they go, "Barbara, look at this."

993
00:36:00.887 --> 00:36:03.767
I just laugh because I’ve been very successful

994
00:36:03.767 --> 00:36:06.157
in being able to open up

995
00:36:06.157 --> 00:36:08.077
in those who wanted it.

996
00:36:08.077 --> 00:36:11.337
This freedom of thinking, this freedom of perception.

997
00:36:12.547 --> 00:36:14.736
It’s quiet. I don’t collect names.

998
00:36:14.736 --> 00:36:16.097
There's no dues.

999
00:36:16.097 --> 00:36:19.027
There's no lists of anybody, but they're everywhere.

1000
00:36:19.027 --> 00:36:19.916
They're all over the world.

1001
00:36:19.916 --> 00:36:21.457
<v Regina>So you feel hopeful?</v>

1002
00:36:21.457 --> 00:36:23.396
<v ->I feel very hopeful,</v>

1003
00:36:23.396 --> 00:36:26.597
and I feel that there's difficult times.

1004
00:36:26.597 --> 00:36:29.487
I don’t want to come off as just everything's gonna be fine.

1005
00:36:29.487 --> 00:36:32.236
It's gonna be really, really difficult.

1006
00:36:32.236 --> 00:36:35.457
However, there are so many brilliant people on the planet,

1007
00:36:35.457 --> 00:36:37.456
and they're waking up every day.

1008
00:36:38.066 --> 00:36:41.247
The process is, indeed, going to be a magnificent process.

1009
00:36:41.247 --> 00:36:44.437
Because I can feel what’s happened to me in my own life,

1010
00:36:44.437 --> 00:36:47.297
and how I’ve turned difficulty into victory,

1011
00:36:47.297 --> 00:36:51.497
and initiation into opening, into empowerment.

1012
00:36:51.497 --> 00:36:53.137
That’s really what it’s all about.

1013
00:36:53.137 --> 00:36:54.177
And as the Pleiadians would say,

1014
00:36:54.177 --> 00:36:57.377
"You know, you're really here to enjoy the body,

1015
00:36:57.377 --> 00:37:00.397
"create an experience, love."

1016
00:37:00.397 --> 00:37:02.737
They say that’s what we all come for, is love.

1017
00:37:02.737 --> 00:37:05.877
And we come to contribute to the creativity

1018
00:37:05.877 --> 00:37:07.886
of each of our perceptions and what we make.

1019
00:37:07.886 --> 00:37:11.257
We add to the creativity of the multi-verse.

1020
00:37:11.257 --> 00:37:12.537
And we're really here to heal.

1021
00:37:12.537 --> 00:37:14.236
This is what this time is about.

1022
00:37:14.236 --> 00:37:16.756
We're healing ourselves, we're healing our ancestors.

1023
00:37:16.756 --> 00:37:21.077
And by healing and eradicating this unnecessary fear,

1024
00:37:21.077 --> 00:37:24.257
I feel, personally, that it qualifies us

1025
00:37:24.257 --> 00:37:25.617
to meet other beings.

1026
00:37:26.037 --> 00:37:29.016
Until any initiation you meet your fear,

1027
00:37:29.016 --> 00:37:30.637
and you can’t get to the other side,

1028
00:37:30.637 --> 00:37:32.196
to those higher frequencies,

1029
00:37:32.196 --> 00:37:35.237
until you move through your fear.

1030
00:37:35.237 --> 00:37:36.938
And no one else can do it for us.

1031
00:37:36.938 --> 00:37:37.987
Every person has to do it themselves.

1032
00:37:37.987 --> 00:37:40.038
So moving through fear and deciding

1033
00:37:40.038 --> 00:37:42.457
that we're courageous and that we are creators,

1034
00:37:42.457 --> 00:37:45.946
and we can process it and go forward.

1035
00:37:45.946 --> 00:37:47.837
That’s taking us to the higher levels.

1036
00:37:47.837 --> 00:37:52.346
This is definitely going to be a fabulous time to be alive!

1037
00:37:53.016 --> 00:37:54.117
<v Regina>Thank you so much!</v>

1038
00:37:54.117 --> 00:37:55.468
<v ->You’re welcome.</v>
