00:00:00.708 --> 00:00:02.668
<v ->How would our world change if we could all use</v>

2
00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:05.249
our hearts and minds to focus our loving intent

3
00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:07.489
on the unwell aspects of our lives

4
00:00:07.489 --> 00:00:10.568
and transform them to a state of health and wholeness?

5
00:00:10.568 --> 00:00:13.129
I would say the effect would be earthshaking.

6
00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.409
Dr. Leonard Laskow has been doing just that

7
00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.148
for nearly 30 years and is now teaching others

8
00:00:18.148 --> 00:00:19.409
to do the same.

9
00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:22.509
He says it's possible because unconditional love

10
00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.198
is at the top of an innate hierarchy of energies.

11
00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:35.569
<v Voiceover>You didn't just,</v>

12
00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:37.688
you didn't wake up one day and decide,

13
00:00:37.688 --> 00:00:39.429
"I'm going to begin healing with love."

14
00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:43.209
You were in a standard medical practice as an OBGYN

15
00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:46.169
and something happened along the way

16
00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:49.089
that made an abrupt change in your plans

17
00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:50.489
for your medical future.

18
00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.509
And I'd like you to just start right there.

19
00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:54.509
<v ->Sure. (laughs)</v>

20
00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:58.448
Yes, I was in a very busy practice in San Francisco,

21
00:00:58.448 --> 00:01:02.028
and I was also on the faculty at UCSF

22
00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:05.028
and I was attending

23
00:01:05.028 --> 00:01:09.018
a two-week retreat.

24
00:01:09.248 --> 00:01:11.188
And during the course of the retreat

25
00:01:11.188 --> 00:01:14.447
I was meditating one evening and it was

26
00:01:14.447 --> 00:01:15.707
the middle of the night

27
00:01:15.707 --> 00:01:17.868
and it was dark in the room that I was meditating

28
00:01:17.868 --> 00:01:19.607
and there was no one else in the room,

29
00:01:19.607 --> 00:01:21.287
and suddenly it felt like,

30
00:01:21.287 --> 00:01:24.227
Oh, somebody just walked in and turned on the lights.

31
00:01:24.227 --> 00:01:26.028
So I opened my eyes,

32
00:01:26.028 --> 00:01:28.927
and the room was still dark and it was empty.

33
00:01:28.927 --> 00:01:31.367
I closed my eyes, and again,

34
00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:34.247
there was this inner luminosity.

35
00:01:34.247 --> 00:01:37.687
And then suddenly, I felt a presence,

36
00:01:37.687 --> 00:01:40.758
and I heard inside my head, a voice.

37
00:01:41.127 --> 00:01:45.658
And this voice, I say a voice, but it was awesome

38
00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:49.477
in it's presentation and it said,

39
00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:54.257
"Your work is to heal with love."

40
00:01:55.228 --> 00:01:58.337
And tears started to roll down my cheeks.

41
00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:01.087
Hair stood up in the back of my head.

42
00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:04.227
And I said, "Oh, so I'm worthy."

43
00:02:04.227 --> 00:02:05.527
And this voice said,

44
00:02:05.527 --> 00:02:09.846
"You are no more or less worthy

45
00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:12.046
than anyone else."

46
00:02:12.046 --> 00:02:16.116
"Your work is to heal with love."

47
00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:19.066
<v Voiceover>Well that's grounding.</v>

48
00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:22.146
<v ->It was so profound, when I said, "Oh I'm worthy,"</v>

49
00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:25.546
that was the little egoic me coming and saying,

50
00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:27.486
"Oh, am I good enough for this?"

51
00:02:27.486 --> 00:02:31.197
This presence would have nothing to do with ego.

52
00:02:31.587 --> 00:02:33.166
It was so clear.

53
00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:35.286
But it was so profound that I couldn't

54
00:02:35.286 --> 00:02:37.636
speak of this for years.

55
00:02:37.826 --> 00:02:39.547
You know, because it was so sacred.

56
00:02:39.547 --> 00:02:43.226
And at the time I didn't fully know what it meant

57
00:02:43.226 --> 00:02:44.006
because I was ...

58
00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:45.446
<v Voiceover>Was it somewhat disconcerting to you</v>

59
00:02:45.446 --> 00:02:47.106
in that you didn't know what it meant,

60
00:02:47.106 --> 00:02:51.046
and yet you felt this deep emotional response and truth?

61
00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:51.686
<v ->Yeah.</v>

62
00:02:51.686 --> 00:02:54.456
Well, it was such a gift of grace.

63
00:02:55.186 --> 00:02:58.066
But I didn't feel, I didn't feel pressured

64
00:02:58.066 --> 00:02:59.927
to go out and do something,

65
00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:02.426
I just knew that if I received this grace

66
00:03:02.426 --> 00:03:06.296
then everything else would unfold gracefully.

67
00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:09.727
And in fact, that's ultimately what happened.

68
00:03:09.727 --> 00:03:10.806
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about what happened</v>

69
00:03:10.806 --> 00:03:12.066
from that point forward, then.

70
00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:14.106
When you really did start to look at,

71
00:03:14.106 --> 00:03:18.416
"Hmm, how do I go about this healing with love now?"

72
00:03:18.826 --> 00:03:21.216
And some of the, some of the ...

73
00:03:21.747 --> 00:03:23.066
There were probably some stops before

74
00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:25.246
you even got into your first experiments

75
00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:27.326
and bringing in the labs and petri dishes

76
00:03:27.326 --> 00:03:28.326
and all this.

77
00:03:28.326 --> 00:03:29.366
<v ->Sure, sure.</v>

78
00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:32.816
Well, initially, what happened again was grace.

79
00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:34.396
There was a ...

80
00:03:34.806 --> 00:03:38.007
I went to another retreat about nine months later

81
00:03:38.007 --> 00:03:41.556
and there was a fellow who had metastatic cancer.

82
00:03:41.606 --> 00:03:44.376
He was a composer of children's songs.

83
00:03:44.786 --> 00:03:46.616
And he was my roommate.

84
00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:49.306
And he had ten baseball-sized lesions

85
00:03:49.306 --> 00:03:51.306
in one lung and seven in another.

86
00:03:51.306 --> 00:03:54.006
One kidney was completely obstructed with cancer,

87
00:03:54.006 --> 00:03:56.266
another was 50% functional.

88
00:03:56.266 --> 00:03:58.887
The middle of the first night he woke up

89
00:03:58.887 --> 00:04:01.826
and he was in pain, and he was having trouble breathing

90
00:04:01.826 --> 00:04:04.497
because of the metastasis.

91
00:04:04.626 --> 00:04:06.526
So I went over and I said, "Can I help?"

92
00:04:06.526 --> 00:04:09.006
And he said, "Anything, Doc, anything."

93
00:04:09.006 --> 00:04:11.266
And I sat down on his bed,

94
00:04:11.266 --> 00:04:14.567
and I just spontaneously visualized above my head

95
00:04:14.567 --> 00:04:16.856
this radiant sun,

96
00:04:17.086 --> 00:04:19.956
like a radiant light.

97
00:04:19.986 --> 00:04:21.226
And a beam of light coming down

98
00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:23.507
through the top of my head into my heart,

99
00:04:23.507 --> 00:04:26.846
overflowing out my shoulders, down my arms.

100
00:04:26.846 --> 00:04:30.567
And I just spontaneously, again this is where grace came in

101
00:04:30.567 --> 00:04:31.546
and guidance,

102
00:04:31.546 --> 00:04:34.286
I just put my hands on both sides of his chest

103
00:04:34.286 --> 00:04:36.666
and recreated this radiant sun,

104
00:04:36.666 --> 00:04:39.406
without any other intentionality.

105
00:04:39.406 --> 00:04:42.386
And after a few moments he started breathing more easily.

106
00:04:42.386 --> 00:04:45.757
And he said, "Thanks Doc, the pain is gone."

107
00:04:46.266 --> 00:04:50.556
And then he went to sleep that night and slept well.

108
00:04:50.826 --> 00:04:52.266
In the morning he wakes up and he says,

109
00:04:52.266 --> 00:04:55.437
"Doc, you're really a healer."

110
00:04:55.586 --> 00:04:58.006
And I remembered, "Healing with love."

111
00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:00.186
Something happened that night

112
00:05:00.186 --> 00:05:01.666
that I couldn't understand.

113
00:05:01.666 --> 00:05:04.506
It was not in my textbook of medicine.

114
00:05:04.506 --> 00:05:07.306
If you look up the index of the textbook of medicine

115
00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:09.786
you don't find the word love.

116
00:05:09.786 --> 00:05:12.346
And yet, something very profound happened.

117
00:05:12.346 --> 00:05:14.566
And he did well for the next few days,

118
00:05:14.566 --> 00:05:18.776
and then he left to go back to Harvard

119
00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:21.246
to receive some chemotherapy.

120
00:05:21.246 --> 00:05:23.426
And I hugged him, we said good-bye.

121
00:05:23.426 --> 00:05:26.716
I thought, I don't know that I'd ever see him again.

122
00:05:27.566 --> 00:05:29.726
But that started this whole process.

123
00:05:29.726 --> 00:05:31.207
Something had happened.

124
00:05:31.207 --> 00:05:34.857
Anyway, just to make the story short,

125
00:05:35.486 --> 00:05:37.946
ten years later I was at a conference.

126
00:05:37.946 --> 00:05:41.036
Here's a fellow singing children's songs.

127
00:05:41.326 --> 00:05:44.936
And I said, "Could it possibly be him?"

128
00:05:45.527 --> 00:05:47.846
And I went over to him and I said,

129
00:05:47.846 --> 00:05:49.566
"Do you remember me?"

130
00:05:49.566 --> 00:05:51.667
And he said, "Doc! You pulled me through

131
00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:53.847
"that night when I was going under."

132
00:05:53.847 --> 00:05:57.166
And we hugged, there were some tears.

133
00:05:57.166 --> 00:06:00.207
And he told me what had happened

134
00:06:00.207 --> 00:06:03.181
when he went back to Harvard.

135
00:06:03.181 --> 00:06:05.721
He was receiving chemotherapy, and he felt

136
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:09.402
it was destroying the remaining quality of life for him.

137
00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:13.041
So he decided, and I'm not encouraging this of course,

138
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:15.341
by any means, but he pulled out the IV,

139
00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:17.681
said, "I don't want any more chemotherapy,"

140
00:06:17.681 --> 00:06:21.610
Said, "If I'm gonna leave then so be it."

141
00:06:21.901 --> 00:06:23.181
And he put on headphones,

142
00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:25.801
started listening to classical music,

143
00:06:25.801 --> 00:06:27.980
with some guided imagery.

144
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.141
And he had an epiphany.

145
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:33.311
He felt an exquisite sense of peace.

146
00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:38.491
He knew, beyond any cognitive knowing,

147
00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:40.631
that who he was

148
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:43.691
was awareness itself.

149
00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:47.291
And it didn't matter what happened to the physical body.

150
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.821
That was six weeks after we had worked together,

151
00:06:51.821 --> 00:06:53.521
so obviously, first of all,

152
00:06:53.521 --> 00:06:56.382
there's nothing that I did personally.

153
00:06:56.382 --> 00:06:59.241
So it wasn't a personal issue.

154
00:07:02.801 --> 00:07:07.331
But a radiologist took some x-rays of him a day after that

155
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:08.400
and came running down the hall saying,

156
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.780
there must be some mistake,

157
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.120
this couldn't be you.

158
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.110
Because everything was gone.

159
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.060
And it was what we call a spontaneous remission,

160
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.960
in medicine, which means we don't know

161
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.729
what the heck happened.

162
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.150
And so he lived for ten years after that.

163
00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:27.599
<v Voiceover>What a fabulous start to healing with love.</v>

164
00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:29.739
This brings us to the notion of love,

165
00:07:29.739 --> 00:07:32.380
because this is a very misunderstood word.

166
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.260
It's a very, very limited, it's a cut-and-paste word we use

167
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.040
for, "Oh, I love this spaghetti."

168
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.240
to something as profound as a body going into

169
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.020
spontaneous healing.

170
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.379
So obviously there's something about this

171
00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:48.040
we're not fully grawking or we don't have a capacity

172
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.740
to full express.

173
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.780
<v ->Right.</v>

174
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.179
<v Voiceover>And I wanted to just,</v>

175
00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:55.300
I lifted this from your book by the way,

176
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.080
it's part of a sentence that you wrote

177
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.110
that just struck me so deeply,

178
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.420
because it rings true for me.

179
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.400
"Love is the awareness of relatedness,

180
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.920
and the impulse toward unity."

181
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.160
<v ->Yes.</v>

182
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.000
<v Voiceover>Now this is what you're talking about</v>

183
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.740
in healing, this is what we call unconditional love.

184
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.400
This is not sentimental love.

185
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.600
<v ->That's right.</v>

186
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.599
That's right.

187
00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:22.179
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about the nature</v>

188
00:08:22.179 --> 00:08:23.660
of the kind of love first

189
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.319
so we have a clear working definition

190
00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:27.000
of what you're talking about in your book.

191
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.680
<v ->Yeah, I think this is really,</v>

192
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.779
this is really very, very important because

193
00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:34.979
it's a word that's what you'd sometimes call

194
00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:37.380
a portmanteau word, like a suitcase word.

195
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.960
You put everything into it,

196
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.399
and you just put the label on it

197
00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:41.859
and you call it love.

198
00:08:41.859 --> 00:08:44.720
"Let's make love." Whatever it is.

199
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.160
What I mean by it,

200
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.380
and that was part of the definition,

201
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:53.351
is an awakening to oneness at the deepest level.

202
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.680
But less than the deepest level,

203
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.130
it's an awareness of connectedness.

204
00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:03.880
It's an acknowledgement of the unity of everything.

205
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.610
But you can feel connected with something that you're eating

206
00:09:09.239 --> 00:09:11.780
you can feel connected with nature.

207
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.240
You can feel connected with the divine.

208
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.199
So there are different levels.

209
00:09:16.199 --> 00:09:20.970
So love is about, unconditioned love

210
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.830
resolves duality into unity.

211
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.341
But conditioned love allows you

212
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:32.391
to relate within the duality,

213
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.361
things within the duality relating to each other.

214
00:09:35.361 --> 00:09:37.491
So I love ...

215
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.540
A particular food.

216
00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.400
<v Voiceover>Pizza.</v>

217
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.040
<v ->Yeah, I love pizza.</v>

218
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.681
I love ice cream.

219
00:09:47.681 --> 00:09:51.130
Meaning, I want to merge with it.

220
00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:53.491
I want to become one with it.

221
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.921
So whenever you feel ...

222
00:09:54.921 --> 00:09:56.060
<v Voiceover>Which is indeed what happens.</v>

223
00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.480
<v ->You eat it.</v>

224
00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.480
So whatever you feel love with,

225
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.030
you want to merge with, you want to become one with.

226
00:10:04.221 --> 00:10:06.960
Again, you can become one with the divine,

227
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.280
become one with a person,

228
00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.980
become one with nature,

229
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.760
whatever it is that you want to become one with.

230
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.531
It also is the key to healing

231
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.640
because you want to become one

232
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.881
with whatever it is that you want to heal,

233
00:10:22.881 --> 00:10:25.650
rather than deny it, resist it,

234
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.500
suppress it, project it onto others,

235
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.560
become victimized by it, so on and so forth.

236
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.640
If instead, you accept it for what it is,

237
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.220
and then merge with it,

238
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.600
become one with it.

239
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.740
<v Voiceover>I wanted to talk about that</v>

240
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.060
because that seems to be really key in this process,

241
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.901
this whole notion of that and moving into resonance

242
00:10:45.901 --> 00:10:49.690
which seems to be everything really.

243
00:10:50.881 --> 00:10:54.721
Let's talk about how that shows up in a person's life.

244
00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:58.290
You already mentioned the things that people tend to do.

245
00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.700
Which is anger, denial, fear, all these normal things

246
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.380
that set up illness to begin with,

247
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.920
is the exact way in which we respond

248
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.140
once an illness has made itself known to us, right?

249
00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.100
<v ->Yeah.</v>

250
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.301
Well, you know you mentioned resonance.

251
00:11:11.301 --> 00:11:14.649
Because resonance is

252
00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:17.409
a real key to healing.

253
00:11:18.578 --> 00:11:20.599
One of the classic examples of resonance,

254
00:11:20.599 --> 00:11:22.759
of course, is with two tuning forks

255
00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:25.059
that both have the same frequency.

256
00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:28.339
Like an A tuning fork and if you strike one A tuning fork

257
00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:30.199
and bring it next to another one,

258
00:11:30.199 --> 00:11:34.609
it induces a vibration in the other one.

259
00:11:35.099 --> 00:11:38.359
But if it's a C tuning fork and you strike an A tuning fork

260
00:11:38.359 --> 00:11:40.719
and you bring it over there, it won't vibrate.

261
00:11:40.719 --> 00:11:44.409
So only similars vibrate with one another.

262
00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:45.819
So they vibrate.

263
00:11:45.819 --> 00:11:50.819
So we can't equate love with resonance per say,

264
00:11:51.039 --> 00:11:54.289
because for example, if you're angry,

265
00:11:54.619 --> 00:11:57.619
if you have anger that's unresolved within you

266
00:11:57.619 --> 00:12:01.409
and you walk into a room and there are angry people

267
00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:05.319
you might get angry at them or with them

268
00:12:05.319 --> 00:12:08.588
because it activates through resonance

269
00:12:08.899 --> 00:12:10.669
that anger.

270
00:12:10.999 --> 00:12:15.419
So resonance by itself is not an example of love.

271
00:12:15.419 --> 00:12:19.539
When you are loving, resonance is always present.

272
00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:21.578
<v Voiceover>Right, it's a component of the process.</v>

273
00:12:21.578 --> 00:12:24.239
<v ->It's a component, always a component</v>

274
00:12:24.239 --> 00:12:25.939
as long as there are two.

275
00:12:25.939 --> 00:12:30.909
Now what love is always seeking is unity.

276
00:12:31.539 --> 00:12:33.339
So that's what love does.

277
00:12:33.339 --> 00:12:35.269
It wants to merge.

278
00:12:35.359 --> 00:12:39.949
Once it merges, it in a way even disappears.

279
00:12:40.179 --> 00:12:43.059
You can use the word love to describe oneness

280
00:12:43.059 --> 00:12:47.669
because love reminds you of the one.

281
00:12:47.859 --> 00:12:49.399
That's the function of love

282
00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:52.799
is for you to remember the oneness

283
00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:56.168
because there's an apparent separation.

284
00:12:56.438 --> 00:13:00.989
We live in a world of apparent separation,

285
00:13:01.119 --> 00:13:06.119
and love reminds you, it remembers the original,

286
00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:08.579
it awakens you to oneness.

287
00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:13.579
So it brings back the members that were apparently separate

288
00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:15.609
but never were.

289
00:13:15.639 --> 00:13:18.979
See, love doesn't create unity because unity always is.

290
00:13:18.979 --> 00:13:23.969
But it reminds us of that unity because we've forgotten it.

291
00:13:24.699 --> 00:13:27.879
As part of the human condition when we came in

292
00:13:27.879 --> 00:13:30.089
we forgot the oneness.

293
00:13:30.859 --> 00:13:35.279
It's part of the play, the dance, the lela,

294
00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:39.279
of life itself, movement.

295
00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:40.538
<v Voiceover>And it seems we're in a time where</v>

296
00:13:40.538 --> 00:13:44.747
people en mass are attempting to remember.

297
00:13:45.778 --> 00:13:47.078
<v ->That's what's happening.</v>

298
00:13:47.078 --> 00:13:49.598
<v Voiceover>Yes, this is the time of remembering.</v>

299
00:13:49.598 --> 00:13:52.128
And so you've taken it ...

300
00:13:52.438 --> 00:13:54.198
By the way, we need to mention,

301
00:13:54.198 --> 00:13:56.918
this isn't something you began a few years ago,

302
00:13:56.918 --> 00:13:58.458
we're going back 25 years.

303
00:13:58.458 --> 00:14:00.517
You were quite a bit ahead of the game

304
00:14:00.517 --> 00:14:02.458
when you began understanding these things

305
00:14:02.458 --> 00:14:04.497
and actually applying them.

306
00:14:04.497 --> 00:14:07.878
So now that I think we have a proper working description

307
00:14:07.878 --> 00:14:09.357
of what love is,

308
00:14:09.357 --> 00:14:11.698
let's go into some of the early experiments

309
00:14:11.698 --> 00:14:14.158
where you weren't just using a placebo effect.

310
00:14:14.158 --> 00:14:15.718
And maybe even explain the difference between

311
00:14:15.718 --> 00:14:19.678
a placebo effect and what you were doing with cells,

312
00:14:19.678 --> 00:14:20.737
living cells.

313
00:14:20.737 --> 00:14:21.418
<v ->Sure.</v>

314
00:14:21.418 --> 00:14:24.878
Well, what I noticed, just since we mentioned my practice,

315
00:14:24.878 --> 00:14:29.638
was when I started doing some of this work

316
00:14:29.638 --> 00:14:31.338
and after all that happened,

317
00:14:31.338 --> 00:14:33.738
the miracles were starting to happen,

318
00:14:33.738 --> 00:14:36.598
when I started exploring in my practice selectively

319
00:14:36.598 --> 00:14:37.738
with patients,

320
00:14:37.738 --> 00:14:41.638
And I noticed that a lot of the stress

321
00:14:41.638 --> 00:14:43.258
that people were feeling,

322
00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:46.958
and almost all the suffering and many illnesses,

323
00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.938
not all illnesses, but many illnesses,

324
00:14:48.938 --> 00:14:52.058
were associated with a perceived sense of separation

325
00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:55.138
that people experienced of one part of themselves

326
00:14:55.138 --> 00:14:59.588
from another that was too painful to hold in consciousness.

327
00:14:59.798 --> 00:15:01.958
You know, they may have had a deep wound

328
00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.478
early in childhood, very common.

329
00:15:04.478 --> 00:15:07.137
It didn't have to be a real wound,

330
00:15:07.137 --> 00:15:09.258
just the way it was perceived.

331
00:15:09.258 --> 00:15:10.498
It could have been.

332
00:15:10.498 --> 00:15:12.518
Or it could have gone back to the time when they

333
00:15:12.518 --> 00:15:15.648
were in their mother's womb.

334
00:15:16.098 --> 00:15:18.657
And they pick up the feelings of the mother

335
00:15:18.657 --> 00:15:20.618
at a preverbal state

336
00:15:20.618 --> 00:15:22.698
and then attribute that to themselves,

337
00:15:22.698 --> 00:15:25.618
"Somehow I'm not okay. I'm not good enough."

338
00:15:25.618 --> 00:15:29.918
"I'm a girl and they wanted a boy."

339
00:15:29.918 --> 00:15:31.858
"I'm not wanted."

340
00:15:31.858 --> 00:15:34.998
Sometimes they feel the fear the mother has

341
00:15:34.998 --> 00:15:38.038
about her capability as a mother,

342
00:15:38.038 --> 00:15:40.098
if it's a first child for example,

343
00:15:40.098 --> 00:15:41.548
and they feel,

344
00:15:41.918 --> 00:15:45.638
"How am I going to survive if she feels that way?

345
00:15:45.638 --> 00:15:48.837
"So I'm not going to say that she's inadequate,

346
00:15:48.837 --> 00:15:51.858
"I'll feel there's something wrong with me."

347
00:15:51.858 --> 00:15:53.638
Now this is not a cognitive process,

348
00:15:53.638 --> 00:15:56.778
but this is what turns out to be one of the

349
00:15:56.778 --> 00:16:01.778
experiential roots of a lot of our diseases,

350
00:16:02.478 --> 00:16:04.698
illnesses I should say, rather than diseases,

351
00:16:04.698 --> 00:16:08.588
illnesses and most of our suffering.

352
00:16:09.658 --> 00:16:12.878
And also our sense of separation from others,

353
00:16:12.878 --> 00:16:15.318
from our environment, our world,

354
00:16:15.318 --> 00:16:18.018
and ultimately our separation from

355
00:16:18.018 --> 00:16:20.297
the divine, our true nature.

356
00:16:20.297 --> 00:16:25.167
So I started doing this work and was getting some

357
00:16:25.658 --> 00:16:27.518
wonderful results in practice.

358
00:16:27.518 --> 00:16:29.518
And I said, "Well, wait a minute,

359
00:16:29.518 --> 00:16:31.198
"My work is to heal with love

360
00:16:31.198 --> 00:16:34.988
"and the world doesn't need another OBGYN.

361
00:16:35.038 --> 00:16:38.838
"This is my calling now, I've been given this great gift

362
00:16:38.838 --> 00:16:42.108
"of knowing what my calling is.

363
00:16:42.818 --> 00:16:45.418
"But how much of what's happening here

364
00:16:45.418 --> 00:16:47.018
"is the placebo effect?"

365
00:16:47.018 --> 00:16:48.598
You give somebody a sugar pill

366
00:16:48.598 --> 00:16:51.898
and they respond as if it's medication

367
00:16:51.898 --> 00:16:56.898
and that belief system actually effects the expression

368
00:16:57.018 --> 00:17:00.148
of their genes.

369
00:17:00.497 --> 00:17:02.537
There's a new science called epigenetics,

370
00:17:02.537 --> 00:17:04.477
which is a reflection of this.

371
00:17:04.477 --> 00:17:05.477
<v Voiceover>Bruce Lipton's work.</v>

372
00:17:05.477 --> 00:17:06.817
<v ->Bruce Lipton's work.</v>

373
00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:08.797
Wonderful example of that.

374
00:17:10.647 --> 00:17:14.097
I said, "I've got to show myself

375
00:17:14.097 --> 00:17:15.157
"that there's something more.

376
00:17:15.157 --> 00:17:17.717
"I knew that there was something beyond belief."

377
00:17:17.717 --> 00:17:19.177
Is what I'm really saying.

378
00:17:19.177 --> 00:17:21.097
It's not just the belief system,

379
00:17:21.097 --> 00:17:24.677
there's something about the interaction of my consciousness

380
00:17:24.677 --> 00:17:26.937
or I could say this consciousness,

381
00:17:26.937 --> 00:17:29.077
and the consciousness of whatever it is

382
00:17:29.077 --> 00:17:30.317
that I'm focusing on,

383
00:17:30.317 --> 00:17:35.177
whether it be something that's organic, alive,

384
00:17:35.177 --> 00:17:37.367
or non-organic.

385
00:17:37.417 --> 00:17:39.327
Such as water even.

386
00:17:39.357 --> 00:17:42.637
So I decided to go into the laboratory.

387
00:17:42.637 --> 00:17:44.377
I fortunately had a number of friends

388
00:17:44.377 --> 00:17:46.557
who were scientists, well-known scientists

389
00:17:46.557 --> 00:17:47.957
in the Bay area,

390
00:17:47.957 --> 00:17:51.357
who worked at some major universities in the Bay area.

391
00:17:51.357 --> 00:17:53.637
And I started doing research with them,

392
00:17:53.637 --> 00:17:56.347
first working on bacteria,

393
00:17:56.797 --> 00:17:58.777
I wanted to see what the impact

394
00:17:58.777 --> 00:18:01.877
of focusing on bacteria would be.

395
00:18:01.877 --> 00:18:04.757
Would love have an impact in the same way

396
00:18:04.757 --> 00:18:09.417
that this, you could say this love that came through

397
00:18:09.417 --> 00:18:12.767
in the form of this radiant sun,

398
00:18:12.817 --> 00:18:15.486
and the space that was just created,

399
00:18:15.537 --> 00:18:18.156
and the grace that was just created,

400
00:18:18.156 --> 00:18:21.957
could that somehow be transferred

401
00:18:21.957 --> 00:18:24.637
to a single-celled organism that was beyond

402
00:18:24.637 --> 00:18:26.627
the placebo effect?

403
00:18:26.657 --> 00:18:28.677
And in fact that's what we found.

404
00:18:28.677 --> 00:18:33.597
What I did was I started looking at the bacteria

405
00:18:33.597 --> 00:18:37.007
under the microscope in a petri dish,

406
00:18:37.357 --> 00:18:39.877
and just to get a sense of what they look like

407
00:18:39.877 --> 00:18:42.317
and this was the salmonella that causes

408
00:18:42.317 --> 00:18:44.227
dysentery in humans.

409
00:18:44.277 --> 00:18:48.487
I looked at it and suddenly had this epiphany,

410
00:18:48.916 --> 00:18:52.987
you have as much right to exist as I do,

411
00:18:53.537 --> 00:18:56.397
because we were created by the same source,

412
00:18:56.397 --> 00:18:57.817
the same creator.

413
00:18:57.817 --> 00:19:00.577
It's just my human perspective that says

414
00:19:00.577 --> 00:19:03.767
there's something wrong with you.

415
00:19:04.037 --> 00:19:05.837
We'll put a name on you,

416
00:19:05.837 --> 00:19:07.117
we'll give you a label,

417
00:19:07.117 --> 00:19:08.817
we'll call it a pathogen.

418
00:19:08.817 --> 00:19:11.877
Later on we call it cancer, you know?

419
00:19:11.877 --> 00:19:13.637
But it exists.

420
00:19:13.637 --> 00:19:15.597
It was created by the same source.

421
00:19:15.597 --> 00:19:16.337
<v Voiceover>And it's struggling</v>

422
00:19:16.337 --> 00:19:17.437
for its own survival.

423
00:19:17.437 --> 00:19:20.807
<v ->Whatever exists wants to persist.</v>

424
00:19:21.257 --> 00:19:23.297
It was just my human perspective,

425
00:19:23.297 --> 00:19:26.767
and something happened when that occurred.

426
00:19:27.697 --> 00:19:30.497
There was a total acceptance of its existence,

427
00:19:30.497 --> 00:19:32.657
an unconditioned acceptance.

428
00:19:32.657 --> 00:19:35.696
And my awareness began to vibrate

429
00:19:35.696 --> 00:19:37.677
at the same frequency as it,

430
00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:41.667
without any distorted filters or conditioning.

431
00:19:42.037 --> 00:19:43.437
<v Voiceover>I wanted to ask you ...</v>

432
00:19:43.437 --> 00:19:45.137
<v ->And as we came into resonance.</v>

433
00:19:45.137 --> 00:19:47.197
<v Voiceover>Right, that's where I started really</v>

434
00:19:47.197 --> 00:19:48.637
perking up while reading your book,

435
00:19:48.637 --> 00:19:50.217
on this notion of resonance,

436
00:19:50.217 --> 00:19:52.976
but how was it that you were able to determine

437
00:19:52.976 --> 00:19:55.037
within your own being that you had reached

438
00:19:55.037 --> 00:19:59.137
that resonance field with that bacteria or cancer cell?

439
00:19:59.137 --> 00:20:00.917
<v ->Ah, that's a wonderful question,</v>

440
00:20:00.917 --> 00:20:05.516
but there was just a oneness,

441
00:20:05.516 --> 00:20:07.316
I would say.

442
00:20:07.316 --> 00:20:08.196
<v Voiceover>You felt this?</v>

443
00:20:08.196 --> 00:20:09.896
<v ->Yeah, there was just space.</v>

444
00:20:09.896 --> 00:20:10.776
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

445
00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:11.976
<v ->There was just oneness.</v>

446
00:20:11.976 --> 00:20:12.836
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

447
00:20:12.836 --> 00:20:13.956
<v ->Is what it was.</v>

448
00:20:13.956 --> 00:20:15.616
<v Voiceover>Where it didn't feel as though it was ...</v>

449
00:20:15.616 --> 00:20:17.116
<v ->I shifted into a non ...</v>

450
00:20:17.116 --> 00:20:21.275
It was a non-ordinary state, we became one

451
00:20:21.275 --> 00:20:23.775
in those moments.

452
00:20:23.775 --> 00:20:24.895
We became one.

453
00:20:24.895 --> 00:20:27.315
And then what I learned was,

454
00:20:27.315 --> 00:20:32.315
if I introduce an intention in that field of oneness,

455
00:20:33.075 --> 00:20:37.094
now this is a deeper state of resonance

456
00:20:37.094 --> 00:20:39.344
called coherence,

457
00:20:40.234 --> 00:20:45.234
where not only are we vibrating together,

458
00:20:45.814 --> 00:20:48.394
but there's also, we come into what's called

459
00:20:48.394 --> 00:20:49.853
phase together.

460
00:20:49.853 --> 00:20:53.694
It's a stronger form of resonance that's characteristic

461
00:20:53.694 --> 00:20:55.874
of lasers for example.

462
00:20:55.874 --> 00:20:58.614
And when you come into that stronger form

463
00:20:58.614 --> 00:21:01.594
of resonance called coherence,

464
00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:03.934
the energy is squared.

465
00:21:03.934 --> 00:21:07.374
Which is why lasers are sometimes used to burn holes

466
00:21:07.374 --> 00:21:10.034
through steel and shoot down missiles

467
00:21:10.034 --> 00:21:11.774
and so on and so forth.

468
00:21:11.774 --> 00:21:15.043
So in effect, I became

469
00:21:15.553 --> 00:21:18.953
a human laser in that moment.

470
00:21:18.953 --> 00:21:21.853
Now it's not just me that's capable of this,

471
00:21:21.853 --> 00:21:23.833
we're all, this is our birthright.

472
00:21:23.833 --> 00:21:27.393
We're all capable of coming into resonance.

473
00:21:27.393 --> 00:21:30.813
Coming into a oneness, essentially,

474
00:21:30.813 --> 00:21:34.053
because oneness is our underlying essential nature.

475
00:21:34.053 --> 00:21:37.293
The oneness of that bacteria and my consciousness

476
00:21:37.293 --> 00:21:40.093
at that level were the same.

477
00:21:40.093 --> 00:21:42.133
And then I introduced an intention,

478
00:21:42.133 --> 00:21:45.793
I unconditionally accepted the presence of this bacteria.

479
00:21:45.793 --> 00:21:49.643
Now when you feel unconditionally accepted,

480
00:21:49.693 --> 00:21:54.693
as you are, totally 100%, what you would feel is love.

481
00:21:56.033 --> 00:21:59.193
So unconditional acceptance is another way

482
00:21:59.193 --> 00:22:01.253
of talking about love.

483
00:22:04.663 --> 00:22:08.013
The bacteria in that laboratory, very interestingly,

484
00:22:08.013 --> 00:22:11.073
a lot of people in the lab were looking at ways

485
00:22:11.073 --> 00:22:12.693
of destroying it, killing it,

486
00:22:12.693 --> 00:22:15.053
the same way that they do with cancer cells.

487
00:22:15.053 --> 00:22:18.613
And those cancer cells and that bacteria,

488
00:22:18.613 --> 00:22:21.123
they resist that.

489
00:22:21.233 --> 00:22:23.013
But when they're loved,

490
00:22:23.013 --> 00:22:25.633
they're totally accepted for what they are,

491
00:22:25.633 --> 00:22:28.453
they release their resistance and they're more open

492
00:22:28.453 --> 00:22:30.733
and when I worked with that bacteria

493
00:22:30.733 --> 00:22:33.523
I wasn't trying to kill it anymore.

494
00:22:33.653 --> 00:22:35.893
Because I just acknowledged its existence,

495
00:22:35.893 --> 00:22:39.473
that's all I wanted to do was reduce its growth rate.

496
00:22:39.473 --> 00:22:40.793
That's all.

497
00:22:40.793 --> 00:22:43.673
Now in the body, if you reduce the growth rate

498
00:22:43.673 --> 00:22:47.113
of a bacteria or cancer cells, so on,

499
00:22:47.113 --> 00:22:52.113
then the immune system, with the killer cells,

500
00:22:52.593 --> 00:22:53.893
the T cells and so on,

501
00:22:53.893 --> 00:22:58.153
can take over and can bring that into balance and harmony

502
00:22:58.153 --> 00:23:00.153
and control the disease.

503
00:23:00.153 --> 00:23:03.013
You don't have to destroy it, per se.

504
00:23:03.013 --> 00:23:06.013
So that's what I found was that I could reduce

505
00:23:06.013 --> 00:23:08.833
the growth rate of the bacteria

506
00:23:08.833 --> 00:23:12.182
by 50% relative to controls.

507
00:23:12.872 --> 00:23:14.052
<v Voiceover>I was reading that in the book,</v>

508
00:23:14.052 --> 00:23:16.182
I thought that this is ...

509
00:23:16.652 --> 00:23:20.072
A lot of people talk about love heals,

510
00:23:20.072 --> 00:23:23.192
however, you went in the lab to really prove it

511
00:23:23.192 --> 00:23:24.393
before you even got going,

512
00:23:24.393 --> 00:23:26.801
and there's a part of this you're talking about that

513
00:23:26.801 --> 00:23:30.660
I want to get a little bit more into for just a moment.

514
00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.500
<v ->Sure.</v>

515
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.600
<v Voiceover>You've gone into resonance and full accpetance</v>

516
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.490
and coherence with the cells.

517
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.240
What is it in the consciousness of the cells

518
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.690
that will then say, "Okay,

519
00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.620
"I'm open to your intention."

520
00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.980
What happens there that you can see?

521
00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.200
It can be mystical.

522
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.260
It doesn't matter where you're coming from on this

523
00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.790
we have pretty sophisticated viewers watching right now.

524
00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.220
What is that thing that happens

525
00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:02.060
that allows those single cells to be open to your intention

526
00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.760
which might be going in a diametrically opposed direction

527
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.460
to where they were headed.

528
00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:10.010
<v ->Well, you know, that's a wonderful question.</v>

529
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.140
See these are single cells,

530
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.871
and in a sense they've been isolated.

531
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.800
And they recognize your consciousness,

532
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.320
my consciousness, this consciousness,

533
00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.170
coming from a

534
00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.300
collective that's in touch with,

535
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.240
aware of unity, oneness.

536
00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.560
Which is what it ultimate wants to evolve too.

537
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:38.370
From that separate sense of itself, separate cell,

538
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:44.980
our bodies are composed of 50-100 trillion cells,

539
00:24:45.759 --> 00:24:49.039
but they're not separate, they're in this organism

540
00:24:49.039 --> 00:24:53.048
and this organism is part of

541
00:24:53.338 --> 00:24:55.137
a collective of humanity

542
00:24:55.137 --> 00:24:57.777
and humanity is part of a collective of the universe

543
00:24:57.777 --> 00:25:00.018
and universes and so on.

544
00:25:01.258 --> 00:25:06.168
But by virtue of the fact that I'm coming from a place of

545
00:25:06.418 --> 00:25:10.458
aware unity, there's a dominion.

546
00:25:10.458 --> 00:25:12.118
If we use that word.

547
00:25:12.118 --> 00:25:16.418
A dominion over the consciousness of the single cell

548
00:25:16.418 --> 00:25:19.498
in the same way that you can work with

549
00:25:20.028 --> 00:25:24.127
entities that are disincarnate,

550
00:25:25.197 --> 00:25:29.727
they use the word exorcisms in religious circles.

551
00:25:30.276 --> 00:25:34.277
But you have dominion over whatever feels separate

552
00:25:34.277 --> 00:25:36.807
because they're living in illusion.

553
00:25:37.137 --> 00:25:38.697
They're living in a trance.

554
00:25:38.697 --> 00:25:41.817
So when you come from this sense of wholeness

555
00:25:41.817 --> 00:25:46.707
there is a natural dominion that listens

556
00:25:46.877 --> 00:25:50.017
to the direction that evolution,

557
00:25:50.017 --> 00:25:52.797
that it wants to inherently move toward.

558
00:25:52.797 --> 00:25:55.657
And so that cell inherently wanted to move

559
00:25:55.657 --> 00:25:57.057
toward that unity

560
00:25:57.057 --> 00:26:01.406
and will accept that guidance to reduce its direction.

561
00:26:01.936 --> 00:26:03.217
So that's what happened.

562
00:26:03.217 --> 00:26:06.297
And then I did the work, of course, with cancer cells.

563
00:26:06.297 --> 00:26:10.197
And there I was exploring different intentions to see,

564
00:26:10.197 --> 00:26:13.417
first of all, if you just casually talk to a cell

565
00:26:13.417 --> 00:26:15.817
in that state, that loving state,

566
00:26:15.817 --> 00:26:17.097
it's one thing,

567
00:26:17.097 --> 00:26:20.807
but if you actually have a stronger intention,

568
00:26:21.017 --> 00:26:24.937
intention has both energy and information in it

569
00:26:24.937 --> 00:26:28.457
and the energy part of it is the desire part,

570
00:26:28.457 --> 00:26:30.017
the feeling.

571
00:26:30.017 --> 00:26:33.857
So if the more energy you put into the intention,

572
00:26:33.857 --> 00:26:36.386
which is with feeling,

573
00:26:36.557 --> 00:26:40.887
the more powerful the impact of that intention.

574
00:26:40.937 --> 00:26:43.937
If it's not just the thought, but also a feeling.

575
00:26:43.937 --> 00:26:47.937
<v Voiceover>You define it as a persistent, focused desire,</v>

576
00:26:47.937 --> 00:26:50.787
which feels absolutely correct.

577
00:26:51.537 --> 00:26:52.076
<v ->Right.</v>

578
00:26:52.076 --> 00:26:53.496
<v Voiceover>Desire, people get confused about</v>

579
00:26:53.496 --> 00:26:55.116
the word desire as well.

580
00:26:55.116 --> 00:26:56.536
<v ->That's right, that's right.</v>

581
00:26:56.536 --> 00:26:59.296
Yeah, well a desire is a movement towards something.

582
00:26:59.296 --> 00:27:01.435
Or a movement away from something.

583
00:27:01.435 --> 00:27:04.176
It's a movement, all desire is about movement

584
00:27:04.176 --> 00:27:08.666
toward the object of your desire or away from something.

585
00:27:08.936 --> 00:27:10.836
Move toward or away from.

586
00:27:10.836 --> 00:27:14.185
But it's a movement, and that movement is energy.

587
00:27:14.656 --> 00:27:18.256
And so you're moving toward a particular goal

588
00:27:18.256 --> 00:27:20.566
with the intention.

589
00:27:20.616 --> 00:27:24.456
So I decided to explore different kinds of intention

590
00:27:24.456 --> 00:27:27.535
and I won't go into details,

591
00:27:27.535 --> 00:27:29.176
some of the intentions I explored were

592
00:27:29.176 --> 00:27:31.376
"Let God's will flow through these hands."

593
00:27:31.376 --> 00:27:33.076
<v Voiceover>I love those experiments,</v>

594
00:27:33.076 --> 00:27:35.756
I like the stats, I like the outcome.

595
00:27:35.756 --> 00:27:37.996
If you want to share what the intention was

596
00:27:37.996 --> 00:27:39.376
and what the actual outcome was

597
00:27:39.376 --> 00:27:41.216
because I found it interesting.

598
00:27:41.216 --> 00:27:43.136
<v ->Okay, well the most powerful intention</v>

599
00:27:43.136 --> 00:27:47.066
that I found when working with the cancer cells was,

600
00:27:47.696 --> 00:27:50.696
"Return to the natural order harmony,

601
00:27:50.696 --> 00:27:54.866
"a growth rate of your pre-hyperactive cell line."

602
00:27:55.396 --> 00:27:59.076
In other words, give them real direction of the way to go.

603
00:27:59.076 --> 00:28:00.436
<v Voiceover>Very clear and specific.</v>

604
00:28:00.436 --> 00:28:03.256
<v ->Yeah, "Of your pre-hyperactive cell line."</v>

605
00:28:05.296 --> 00:28:07.236
I initially used the word pre-cancer,

606
00:28:07.236 --> 00:28:09.896
but then I said, "Let's not use that label."

607
00:28:09.896 --> 00:28:12.306
They were just more active.

608
00:28:13.156 --> 00:28:16.076
And return to that natural order harmony.

609
00:28:16.076 --> 00:28:19.056
So that was the most powerful of the intentions.

610
00:28:19.056 --> 00:28:20.616
Then I wanted to explore,

611
00:28:20.616 --> 00:28:23.896
what's the relationship between a thought-form intention,

612
00:28:23.896 --> 00:28:27.466
such as what I gave you, and an image.

613
00:28:27.556 --> 00:28:30.605
So if I held an image

614
00:28:31.695 --> 00:28:35.085
of what I wanted as an end result,

615
00:28:35.195 --> 00:28:36.655
what was the result of that?

616
00:28:36.655 --> 00:28:40.115
When I compared when I just did the thought-form

617
00:28:40.115 --> 00:28:44.174
I got a 20% inhibition of growth rate

618
00:28:44.174 --> 00:28:46.815
relative to contemporaneous controls

619
00:28:46.815 --> 00:28:50.445
measured by the uptake of radioactive thymidine

620
00:28:52.155 --> 00:28:55.274
in the DNA of these growing cancer cells.

621
00:28:55.274 --> 00:28:57.594
We used a scintillation counter and so on.

622
00:28:57.594 --> 00:29:00.964
Very sophisticated analysis here.

623
00:29:01.314 --> 00:29:04.113
But what we found was a 20% reduction.

624
00:29:04.113 --> 00:29:09.113
Now if we added imagery to that thought-form,

625
00:29:09.654 --> 00:29:11.124
we doubled it.

626
00:29:11.354 --> 00:29:12.814
<v Voiceover>That's an astounding ...</v>

627
00:29:12.814 --> 00:29:15.434
<v ->So thought plus imagery.</v>

628
00:29:15.434 --> 00:29:16.714
<v Voiceover>40 plus percent?</v>

629
00:29:16.714 --> 00:29:17.814
<v ->40%.</v>

630
00:29:17.814 --> 00:29:19.113
And then we found,

631
00:29:19.113 --> 00:29:21.194
and this is what made for the elegant,

632
00:29:21.194 --> 00:29:25.943
is if I used imagery with a reverse intent,

633
00:29:26.614 --> 00:29:31.424
to actually stimulate the growth of these cancer cells,

634
00:29:32.114 --> 00:29:34.494
we found that we could do that as well.

635
00:29:34.494 --> 00:29:37.444
So we could inhibit or stimulate.

636
00:29:37.914 --> 00:29:41.693
We stimulated the growth rate by 15%

637
00:29:41.693 --> 00:29:44.114
relative to contemporaneous controls.

638
00:29:44.114 --> 00:29:48.603
And that's when I knew that love had a real impact.

639
00:29:49.574 --> 00:29:52.894
Love plus intention had a real impact

640
00:29:54.994 --> 00:29:58.354
on the growth of cancer cells and bacteria.

641
00:29:58.354 --> 00:30:01.394
And I subsequently did research with DNA

642
00:30:01.394 --> 00:30:03.364
and even water.

643
00:30:03.555 --> 00:30:04.853
Even water.

644
00:30:04.853 --> 00:30:07.164
We were able to change the

645
00:30:09.294 --> 00:30:12.304
optical density of water.

646
00:30:12.353 --> 00:30:15.033
Actually changing the angle between

647
00:30:15.033 --> 00:30:18.654
the oxygen and the two hydrogen ions

648
00:30:18.654 --> 00:30:21.934
in such a way that it was reflected in some of the

649
00:30:21.934 --> 00:30:24.944
devices that we use to measure it.

650
00:30:25.534 --> 00:30:28.434
And also it changed the acidity of the water,

651
00:30:28.434 --> 00:30:30.774
the solubility, and the surface tension.

652
00:30:30.774 --> 00:30:34.333
So, you know, we're not just talking about love as

653
00:30:35.103 --> 00:30:38.704
something that's the stuff of poets and mystics here.

654
00:30:38.734 --> 00:30:42.314
This is something that was real impact

655
00:30:42.314 --> 00:30:45.603
on living and non-living systems.

656
00:30:45.714 --> 00:30:48.034
And that's when I decided to leave my practice

657
00:30:48.034 --> 00:30:50.044
and say, "Okay."

658
00:30:51.154 --> 00:30:52.794
Of course colleagues were saying,

659
00:30:52.794 --> 00:30:56.213
"You're selling one of the best practices

660
00:30:56.213 --> 00:31:00.004
"in San Francisco to do what?"

661
00:31:00.034 --> 00:31:00.634
You know?

662
00:31:00.634 --> 00:31:02.614
<v Voiceover>I'm sure they did.</v>

663
00:31:03.034 --> 00:31:05.014
<v ->But this is what I ...</v>

664
00:31:05.014 --> 00:31:06.294
I had that calling.

665
00:31:06.294 --> 00:31:07.894
Your work was to heal with love,

666
00:31:07.894 --> 00:31:10.954
and then I wrote the book called Healing With Love.

667
00:31:10.954 --> 00:31:13.073
And it wasn't that easy because the editors

668
00:31:13.073 --> 00:31:15.654
at Harper said, "No, you can't use that title,

669
00:31:15.654 --> 00:31:20.114
"It's too new-agey nobodies gonna, Healing with Love."

670
00:31:20.114 --> 00:31:22.674
I said, "It has to be that."

671
00:31:22.674 --> 00:31:24.194
I kept insisting and finally they said,

672
00:31:24.194 --> 00:31:26.814
"Okay, we're gonna give in to this guy

673
00:31:26.814 --> 00:31:28.194
"and let him do it."

674
00:31:28.194 --> 00:31:30.314
So that's why the book is called Healing with Love.

675
00:31:30.314 --> 00:31:31.994
<v Voiceover>And in this book you,</v>

676
00:31:31.994 --> 00:31:34.194
it is chock a block with information,

677
00:31:34.194 --> 00:31:37.194
it's chock a block with the protocols,

678
00:31:37.194 --> 00:31:39.194
the actual protocols that you developed

679
00:31:39.194 --> 00:31:40.553
over a period of time

680
00:31:40.553 --> 00:31:44.594
so that it's quite accessible to the person

681
00:31:44.594 --> 00:31:47.754
reading it to be able to start integrating

682
00:31:47.754 --> 00:31:49.414
these practices into their own lives

683
00:31:49.414 --> 00:31:50.794
for their own self-healing,

684
00:31:50.794 --> 00:31:53.474
or to use in the healing of others as well.

685
00:31:53.474 --> 00:31:54.674
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

686
00:31:54.674 --> 00:31:56.434
<v Voiceover>And it's okay, on camera to say healing,</v>

687
00:31:56.434 --> 00:31:57.314
isn't it.

688
00:31:57.314 --> 00:31:58.874
<v ->Yes, yeah.</v>

689
00:31:58.874 --> 00:32:00.904
Yeah, exactly.

690
00:32:01.274 --> 00:32:05.013
What I did was I developed these protocols.

691
00:32:05.013 --> 00:32:08.434
I called the work holoenergetics,

692
00:32:08.434 --> 00:32:10.633
healing with the energy of the whole

693
00:32:10.633 --> 00:32:12.874
that's greater than the sum of the parts,

694
00:32:12.874 --> 00:32:15.974
because I mentioned,

695
00:32:15.974 --> 00:32:20.364
a lot of illness was associated with the

696
00:32:21.754 --> 00:32:25.134
illusion and the sense of separation

697
00:32:25.134 --> 00:32:28.044
of one part of ourselves, from another,

698
00:32:28.274 --> 00:32:29.714
ourselves from others,

699
00:32:29.714 --> 00:32:33.024
and from our connection with our central nature.

700
00:32:33.314 --> 00:32:34.724
And so

701
00:32:38.664 --> 00:32:43.664
if separation is an apparency, an illusion

702
00:32:44.714 --> 00:32:46.974
and you're maintaining this separation,

703
00:32:46.974 --> 00:32:48.784
it must take energy.

704
00:32:48.834 --> 00:32:51.114
In fact, it takes an enormous amount of energy

705
00:32:51.114 --> 00:32:53.414
to maintain the illusion of separation.

706
00:32:53.414 --> 00:32:55.234
It takes an enormous amount of energy

707
00:32:55.234 --> 00:32:59.164
to keep those wounds suppressed,

708
00:32:59.434 --> 00:33:01.574
buried, disowned,

709
00:33:01.574 --> 00:33:04.364
and even to project it onto others.

710
00:33:04.714 --> 00:33:08.024
In the form of victim and so on and so forth.

711
00:33:08.374 --> 00:33:11.394
So I thought, well if we could release this energy

712
00:33:11.394 --> 00:33:14.214
of separation by bringing people back into wholeness,

713
00:33:14.214 --> 00:33:16.494
into an awareness of their essential nature,

714
00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:19.033
all this energy would be available for healing

715
00:33:19.033 --> 00:33:22.404
because healing occurs naturally in the body.

716
00:33:22.433 --> 00:33:24.334
The body knows how to heal.

717
00:33:24.334 --> 00:33:28.384
And if you can release the energy of separation,

718
00:33:28.754 --> 00:33:30.414
through love,

719
00:33:30.414 --> 00:33:33.034
bringing that which appears to be separate

720
00:33:33.034 --> 00:33:35.633
back into unity, into wholeness,

721
00:33:35.633 --> 00:33:37.814
this energy of love is released

722
00:33:37.814 --> 00:33:40.294
and facilitates the healing process.

723
00:33:40.294 --> 00:33:43.704
It actually profoundly facilitates the healing process.

724
00:33:44.174 --> 00:33:46.234
So, in other words, there are times when just

725
00:33:46.234 --> 00:33:48.804
that release through love

726
00:33:48.934 --> 00:33:51.264
is sufficient for healing.

727
00:33:52.594 --> 00:33:55.514
Physical, literal physical healing,

728
00:33:55.514 --> 00:33:57.394
emotional healing, mental healing.

729
00:33:57.394 --> 00:34:00.134
Just that release of energy is enough.

730
00:34:00.134 --> 00:34:02.924
In spiritual healing, it's ...

731
00:34:03.334 --> 00:34:05.914
In other words, love is not necessary for healing,

732
00:34:05.914 --> 00:34:08.214
because the body knows how to heal.

733
00:34:08.214 --> 00:34:10.913
People could be angry and full of hate,

734
00:34:10.913 --> 00:34:12.884
and they'll still heal.

735
00:34:13.434 --> 00:34:17.274
But love by itself is sufficient to stimulate

736
00:34:17.274 --> 00:34:18.894
the healing process.

737
00:34:18.894 --> 00:34:19.733
That's what I learned.

738
00:34:19.733 --> 00:34:21.534
Then in spiritual healing,

739
00:34:21.534 --> 00:34:24.964
in the deeper holoenergetic healing work,

740
00:34:26.014 --> 00:34:29.914
love is both necessary and sufficient,

741
00:34:29.914 --> 00:34:33.984
in spiritual healing, love is necessary and sufficient.

742
00:34:34.514 --> 00:34:35.544
Both.

743
00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:38.493
<v Voiceover>Now when we talk about going through</v>

744
00:34:38.493 --> 00:34:41.153
these various processes of healing,

745
00:34:41.153 --> 00:34:42.994
one of the areas that ...

746
00:34:42.994 --> 00:34:46.194
There's one little story that you tell in there

747
00:34:46.194 --> 00:34:50.014
about unconditional love being more than sufficient

748
00:34:50.014 --> 00:34:50.994
in this case,

749
00:34:50.994 --> 00:34:52.994
and it's a fun story because it has to do with

750
00:34:52.994 --> 00:34:55.353
a professional basketball player.

751
00:34:55.353 --> 00:34:57.594
<v ->Oh yeah, Sleepy Floyd.</v>

752
00:34:57.594 --> 00:34:58.634
<v Voiceover>Sleepy Floyd.</v>

753
00:34:58.634 --> 00:34:59.653
I love that story.

754
00:34:59.653 --> 00:35:01.334
Can you talk about that just because I think

755
00:35:01.334 --> 00:35:04.574
everybody watching this can really feel this.

756
00:35:04.574 --> 00:35:07.874
<v ->Right, now this was, he was on the professional</v>

757
00:35:07.874 --> 00:35:11.413
basketball team the Golden State Warriors,

758
00:35:13.983 --> 00:35:16.875
they were behind and they were playing in the championship

759
00:35:16.875 --> 00:35:20.674
and somebody put up a sign that said,

760
00:35:20.674 --> 00:35:24.644
"Sleepy, win or lose we love you."

761
00:35:25.314 --> 00:35:29.944
And he saw that sign and something happened within him.

762
00:35:30.314 --> 00:35:31.474
And he said it didn't matter,

763
00:35:31.474 --> 00:35:33.614
since it was "win or lose we love you."

764
00:35:33.614 --> 00:35:36.474
it didn't matter what happened.

765
00:35:36.474 --> 00:35:39.674
And he suddenly went on to set a record,

766
00:35:39.674 --> 00:35:42.434
they won the game, the championship,

767
00:35:42.434 --> 00:35:44.773
and he set a record for the most points scored

768
00:35:44.773 --> 00:35:46.174
in a quarter.

769
00:35:46.174 --> 00:35:47.434
<v Voiceover>What, 29 points in a quarter?</v>

770
00:35:47.434 --> 00:35:49.854
<v ->Yeah, 29 points in a quarter.</v>

771
00:35:49.854 --> 00:35:53.914
And he said something shifted for him when he saw that

772
00:35:53.914 --> 00:35:57.643
and he felt unconditionally loved.

773
00:35:58.533 --> 00:36:02.564
And that put him, again,

774
00:36:03.154 --> 00:36:06.884
into not only an altered state,

775
00:36:07.034 --> 00:36:09.864
but at one with source.

776
00:36:09.914 --> 00:36:12.044
And he couldn't miss.

777
00:36:12.534 --> 00:36:14.173
No matter what he did,

778
00:36:14.173 --> 00:36:18.074
because it wasn't him as a personality,

779
00:36:18.074 --> 00:36:19.714
wasn't him as an ego,

780
00:36:19.714 --> 00:36:23.144
it was him simply at one with source.

781
00:36:23.654 --> 00:36:24.814
So no matter what he did.

782
00:36:24.814 --> 00:36:25.594
<v Voiceover>In that state of unity.</v>

783
00:36:25.594 --> 00:36:27.574
<v ->He was in a total state of unity,</v>

784
00:36:27.574 --> 00:36:30.894
so that whatever was wanted happened.

785
00:36:30.894 --> 00:36:32.694
That's the manifestation,

786
00:36:32.694 --> 00:36:35.094
and that actually is the way healing works.

787
00:36:35.094 --> 00:36:37.314
When you enter into that state of unity,

788
00:36:37.314 --> 00:36:38.794
through love,

789
00:36:38.794 --> 00:36:40.394
then whatever is wanted,

790
00:36:40.394 --> 00:36:43.594
whatever is for the highest good, happens.

791
00:36:43.594 --> 00:36:45.954
In this case, the highest good was for him to score

792
00:36:45.954 --> 00:36:50.954
those 29 points and manifest unconditioned love.

793
00:36:51.573 --> 00:36:52.634
In action.

794
00:36:52.634 --> 00:36:53.834
<v Voiceover>And it is interesting for that,</v>

795
00:36:53.834 --> 00:36:57.054
that being the macro type of scenario

796
00:36:57.054 --> 00:36:59.334
to the micro scenario.

797
00:36:59.334 --> 00:37:02.114
What if every cell in our body felt that love?

798
00:37:02.114 --> 00:37:03.594
<v ->Exactly.</v>

799
00:37:03.594 --> 00:37:05.504
Exactly.

800
00:37:05.594 --> 00:37:07.574
And so I developed some processes,

801
00:37:07.574 --> 00:37:09.434
one I call the tracing process.

802
00:37:09.434 --> 00:37:11.474
The holoenergetic tracing process,

803
00:37:11.474 --> 00:37:14.654
where you actually go back to the experiential root

804
00:37:14.654 --> 00:37:18.274
of an issue, maybe even in your mother's womb

805
00:37:18.274 --> 00:37:20.734
or every early in childhood

806
00:37:20.734 --> 00:37:22.493
and deeply experience that.

807
00:37:22.493 --> 00:37:25.695
And then what it is that started you

808
00:37:25.695 --> 00:37:28.734
into that separative process.

809
00:37:28.734 --> 00:37:31.014
Experience where you separated out.

810
00:37:31.014 --> 00:37:34.674
It could have been an actual event that happened.

811
00:37:34.674 --> 00:37:36.894
It could have been a misperception

812
00:37:36.894 --> 00:37:40.413
or an interpretation that became crystallized as a belief.

813
00:37:40.413 --> 00:37:42.534
<v Voiceover>And so much of it really is a perception issue</v>

814
00:37:42.534 --> 00:37:44.034
<v ->It is, it is.</v>

815
00:37:44.034 --> 00:37:47.874
Yeah, I remember when I was in Sri Lanka,

816
00:37:47.874 --> 00:37:50.164
I went to an elephant farm

817
00:37:50.974 --> 00:37:53.394
and these elephants were moving big logs

818
00:37:53.394 --> 00:37:56.614
and there was one huge male elephant

819
00:37:56.614 --> 00:37:59.133
that was often on the side there

820
00:37:59.133 --> 00:38:00.814
and they said, "Don't go near him.

821
00:38:00.814 --> 00:38:03.674
"He's a tough character."

822
00:38:03.674 --> 00:38:07.173
And we looked over and we saw that he had

823
00:38:07.173 --> 00:38:10.554
a chain around his leg and it was tied to a little tree,

824
00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:13.614
I mean they're used to carrying these huge logs.

825
00:38:13.614 --> 00:38:17.054
I said, "He's tied to this little tree."

826
00:38:17.054 --> 00:38:21.174
They said, "He's been tied to that tree since he was young

827
00:38:21.174 --> 00:38:24.414
"and if we tied him to one of those big trees

828
00:38:24.414 --> 00:38:26.654
"he'd pull it out by the roots.

829
00:38:26.654 --> 00:38:28.794
"But as long as he's tied to that little tree,

830
00:38:28.794 --> 00:38:31.674
"he believes that he doesn't have the strength

831
00:38:31.674 --> 00:38:32.913
"to do that."

832
00:38:32.913 --> 00:38:36.414
And I looked, that's the power of belief.

833
00:38:36.414 --> 00:38:38.974
And that's what we do in our lives.

834
00:38:38.974 --> 00:38:43.634
We have these unconscious early issues and beliefs

835
00:38:43.634 --> 00:38:47.794
that keep us limited at that level.

836
00:38:47.794 --> 00:38:50.034
So I developed this tracing process

837
00:38:50.034 --> 00:38:52.754
which allows us to go back to those experiential roots

838
00:38:52.754 --> 00:38:56.274
and pull them up by the root

839
00:38:56.274 --> 00:38:59.284
and then replace them with

840
00:39:00.074 --> 00:39:03.034
what we really, really wanted to feel and believe

841
00:39:03.034 --> 00:39:04.394
at that time.

842
00:39:04.394 --> 00:39:06.913
It's actually, when we say we wanted to feel,

843
00:39:06.913 --> 00:39:11.094
it turns out that it's what our soul really wants to feel

844
00:39:12.454 --> 00:39:16.172
as it expresses itself in this body, in this form,

845
00:39:16.172 --> 00:39:17.312
in this lifetime.

846
00:39:17.312 --> 00:39:18.331
What does it want to feel.

847
00:39:18.331 --> 00:39:20.432
And each of us has the unique combination

848
00:39:20.432 --> 00:39:25.091
of about five to six to seven feelings

849
00:39:25.091 --> 00:39:28.492
that we want to explore and express and experience

850
00:39:28.492 --> 00:39:29.751
this lifetime.

851
00:39:29.751 --> 00:39:32.132
Like our own soul fingerprint,

852
00:39:32.132 --> 00:39:36.232
which comes up in the course of this tracing process.

853
00:39:38.562 --> 00:39:41.451
And it's done in a field of coherent love.

854
00:39:41.451 --> 00:39:43.831
That's the secret that makes it work.

855
00:39:43.831 --> 00:39:46.491
It has to be done in a coherent field of love

856
00:39:46.491 --> 00:39:48.840
so the practitioner,

857
00:39:49.571 --> 00:39:52.190
the most important quality of the practitioner

858
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:56.501
is to be able to develop this field of coherent love.

859
00:39:57.031 --> 00:40:01.031
And then I also found, I developed another process

860
00:40:01.031 --> 00:40:04.151
the holoenergetic forgiveness process.

861
00:40:04.151 --> 00:40:05.751
Which is extraordinarily powerful

862
00:40:05.751 --> 00:40:08.341
because you need to forgive.

863
00:40:08.351 --> 00:40:11.471
It seems like you're forgiving the other,

864
00:40:11.471 --> 00:40:14.051
for what they did or didn't do.

865
00:40:14.051 --> 00:40:16.611
But it's really an internal process

866
00:40:16.611 --> 00:40:18.971
and it has nothing to do with the other person

867
00:40:18.971 --> 00:40:20.571
because everything that's going on

868
00:40:20.571 --> 00:40:24.271
is taking place right now, right here within you.

869
00:40:24.271 --> 00:40:27.321
So it's all really about you.

870
00:40:27.471 --> 00:40:30.411
And the most important person to forgive, actually

871
00:40:30.411 --> 00:40:32.051
is you.

872
00:40:32.051 --> 00:40:35.591
But you as the little one inside yourself,

873
00:40:35.591 --> 00:40:37.791
you as the adolescent teenager,

874
00:40:37.791 --> 00:40:41.110
and you as the adult for the things you did

875
00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:43.811
or didn't do that were not loving.

876
00:40:43.811 --> 00:40:46.351
Things that you felt ashamed of,

877
00:40:46.351 --> 00:40:48.111
things that you felt guilty.

878
00:40:48.111 --> 00:40:50.530
Because that's what's separating you

879
00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:52.151
from your essential nature.

880
00:40:52.151 --> 00:40:53.970
These are some of the veils.

881
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:56.830
And then the deeper veils are when you start to realize

882
00:40:56.830 --> 00:41:00.751
you're identifying who you are

883
00:41:00.751 --> 00:41:03.231
with your mind-made self.

884
00:41:03.231 --> 00:41:05.361
With the little me

885
00:41:05.691 --> 00:41:09.611
that has thoughts that come that are not even your thoughts

886
00:41:09.611 --> 00:41:11.731
Feelings that are not even your feelings.

887
00:41:11.731 --> 00:41:14.091
And then they may be yours, but they come and they go

888
00:41:14.091 --> 00:41:18.561
and you say, "I'm the story, this whole story.

889
00:41:19.231 --> 00:41:22.511
"And I'm the beliefs that I have

890
00:41:22.511 --> 00:41:24.810
"that are conscious or unconscious.

891
00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:27.151
"I'm the judgements that I have about myself

892
00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:28.410
"and other people."

893
00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:31.051
So when you see that and transcend it

894
00:41:31.051 --> 00:41:34.091
then the inner light of your true nature

895
00:41:34.091 --> 00:41:35.431
can shine forth.

896
00:41:35.431 --> 00:41:39.031
Start to dissolve these veils that separate us

897
00:41:39.031 --> 00:41:40.731
from our essential nature.

898
00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:45.250
So these processes really allow that to happen,

899
00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:47.291
but again, the key is

900
00:41:48.161 --> 00:41:50.731
that the practitioner who does this

901
00:41:50.731 --> 00:41:53.791
be in a state of coherent love.

902
00:41:53.791 --> 00:41:56.031
So that's the key to this whole process.

903
00:41:56.031 --> 00:41:58.611
<v Voiceover>You're very, very good in this book</v>

904
00:41:58.611 --> 00:42:01.770
and very clearly articulating the pathways

905
00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:03.411
into these states,

906
00:42:03.411 --> 00:42:06.231
and also tools to be able to develop this

907
00:42:06.231 --> 00:42:08.111
if it's not something you've already experienced

908
00:42:08.111 --> 00:42:09.610
and doesn't come easily.

909
00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:12.671
The book really is full of step-by-step,

910
00:42:12.671 --> 00:42:14.931
every tool right down into some of the tools

911
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:18.271
that you say are in the book are very helpful

912
00:42:18.271 --> 00:42:20.861
if not necessary,

913
00:42:20.951 --> 00:42:23.350
and that is going into the work of breathing,

914
00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:25.471
for example, using breathing even

915
00:42:25.471 --> 00:42:27.951
in the development of intuition.

916
00:42:27.951 --> 00:42:30.850
You also talk about the four Rs and

917
00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:33.130
we don't need to go into them right now, do we?

918
00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:33.851
Or do we?

919
00:42:33.851 --> 00:42:34.490
<v ->No, no, no.</v>

920
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:36.071
<v ->Yeah, we don't need to because that's part of that</v>

921
00:42:36.071 --> 00:42:39.790
recognition, resonance, release, and reformation

922
00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:41.071
during the healing process,

923
00:42:41.071 --> 00:42:43.051
and that's really, I think people can ...

924
00:42:43.051 --> 00:42:44.331
We can save that for the book.

925
00:42:44.331 --> 00:42:47.231
But let's talk a little bit about the breathing,

926
00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:48.571
the breath and the process.

927
00:42:48.571 --> 00:42:50.631
<v ->Yeah, well you know,</v>

928
00:42:52.451 --> 00:42:55.311
breath is really another way of looking at spirit

929
00:42:55.311 --> 00:42:57.251
that's why the way inspiration,

930
00:42:57.251 --> 00:43:00.351
taking in spirit when you breath in

931
00:43:00.351 --> 00:43:03.411
and expiration, you're breathing out spirit,

932
00:43:03.411 --> 00:43:05.111
when you're breathing in, breathing out.

933
00:43:05.111 --> 00:43:06.731
And what I started to do,

934
00:43:06.731 --> 00:43:10.351
I started to do some research at UC Davis,

935
00:43:12.241 --> 00:43:15.310
seeing what happens if I breath in through one nostril

936
00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:17.600
and out through another.

937
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:20.090
There's an ancient technique

938
00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:23.090
where you close one nostril and breath in

939
00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:25.310
through the alternate nostril,

940
00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:29.939
and then breath out through the other nostril.

941
00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:34.349
And what I found when I hooked myself up

942
00:43:34.349 --> 00:43:35.989
to an electrocardiogram,

943
00:43:35.989 --> 00:43:39.990
worked with a professor of physiology at the university,

944
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:41.769
medical physiology.

945
00:43:43.039 --> 00:43:45.690
Because it seemed to me that if I was picking up my hand

946
00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:49.061
I was activating the contralateral hemisphere,

947
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:51.090
that's not a good way to do this

948
00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:54.410
if we want to create balance in both hemispheres.

949
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:57.109
So I thought, well, let's just imagine

950
00:43:57.109 --> 00:44:00.030
the breath coming in and leaving,

951
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:02.749
and coming in and leaving alternately.

952
00:44:02.749 --> 00:44:04.449
<v Voiceover>So don't touch your nostrils then</v>

953
00:44:04.449 --> 00:44:06.290
in the process of this alternate breathing.

954
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:08.470
<v ->Yeah, imagine it and feel the hairs,</v>

955
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:10.550
feel the cool air coming in,

956
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:14.340
and then feel it coming out a little warmer

957
00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:15.569
and such.

958
00:44:15.569 --> 00:44:17.469
And if you just imagine it,

959
00:44:17.469 --> 00:44:21.049
and I have these pictures, graphs in the book,

960
00:44:21.049 --> 00:44:23.589
of both hemispheres coming into a beautiful

961
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:24.669
state of balance.

962
00:44:24.669 --> 00:44:27.248
And when that happens something,

963
00:44:27.248 --> 00:44:30.369
a phenomenon appears called the blue pearl,

964
00:44:30.369 --> 00:44:34.769
which is described in some of the eastern literature.

965
00:44:34.769 --> 00:44:37.469
When both hemispheres come into balance.

966
00:44:37.469 --> 00:44:39.549
And so you can bring both hemispheres

967
00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:43.989
into balance in a beautiful way through breathing alone.

968
00:44:43.989 --> 00:44:46.009
And you can also bring both hemispheres

969
00:44:46.009 --> 00:44:48.528
into balance by breathing in and out

970
00:44:48.528 --> 00:44:50.419
through your heart.

971
00:44:50.529 --> 00:44:54.389
Now you can breath in and out through the alternate nostrils

972
00:44:54.389 --> 00:44:56.769
and then you can imagine simultaneously

973
00:44:56.769 --> 00:44:59.709
breathing in through both nostrils,

974
00:44:59.709 --> 00:45:02.729
bringing your breath up to the center of your forehead here,

975
00:45:02.729 --> 00:45:04.148
and releasing your breath through the

976
00:45:04.148 --> 00:45:05.728
center of your forehead,

977
00:45:05.728 --> 00:45:09.538
and that opens up your intuitive senses,

978
00:45:09.788 --> 00:45:12.768
in a very elegant and powerful way.

979
00:45:12.768 --> 00:45:16.668
You can also bring your breath up through both nostrils

980
00:45:16.668 --> 00:45:17.888
to the center of your forehead

981
00:45:17.888 --> 00:45:21.028
and release your breath into the space

982
00:45:21.028 --> 00:45:22.488
in the back of your head.

983
00:45:22.488 --> 00:45:25.808
There's an area called the third ventricle here,

984
00:45:25.808 --> 00:45:28.728
but you just imagine it also has space in it

985
00:45:28.728 --> 00:45:30.888
and you breath into that space

986
00:45:30.888 --> 00:45:33.628
and that opens you to a different form

987
00:45:33.628 --> 00:45:36.588
of intuitive guidance as well.

988
00:45:36.588 --> 00:45:38.647
Then you can release your breath

989
00:45:38.647 --> 00:45:40.808
into the top of your head, the crown,

990
00:45:40.808 --> 00:45:45.808
and that opens you directly to divine connection.

991
00:45:47.448 --> 00:45:48.921
And then you can also release your breath

992
00:45:48.921 --> 00:45:50.861
into your heart space.

993
00:45:50.861 --> 00:45:55.130
It's a beautiful space in the back of your heart,

994
00:45:56.001 --> 00:45:57.981
you're not aware of it normally,

995
00:45:57.981 --> 00:46:00.080
but if you imagine that there's a space

996
00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.201
in the back of your heart

997
00:46:01.201 --> 00:46:03.821
and you breath through the center of your chest

998
00:46:03.821 --> 00:46:05.162
into that space

999
00:46:06.972 --> 00:46:09.301
and bring your awareness to that space

1000
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:10.240
in the back of your heart

1001
00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:14.220
and start to look at everything from the space

1002
00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:15.940
in the back of your heart,

1003
00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:19.079
from the space in the back of your heart.

1004
00:46:19.079 --> 00:46:20.960
So that the space becomes the context

1005
00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.600
and everything else is in the foreground,

1006
00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.359
that's the background and everything is in the foreground,

1007
00:46:26.359 --> 00:46:27.980
everything looks different.

1008
00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:30.400
<v Voiceover>You've become an observer of a different type.</v>

1009
00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.840
<v ->You've become the observer, the witness,</v>

1010
00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.030
in a different way.

1011
00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:38.779
You become the aware witness from that space

1012
00:46:38.779 --> 00:46:40.759
in the back of your heart.

1013
00:46:40.759 --> 00:46:41.740
<v Voiceover>And how do you apply ...</v>

1014
00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:43.519
<v ->And you can listen to music that way,</v>

1015
00:46:43.519 --> 00:46:45.580
you can do healing that way,

1016
00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:48.340
you can enter into relationship

1017
00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:51.320
from the space in the back of your heart.

1018
00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.800
<v Voiceover>I can feel that as we're talking.</v>

1019
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.180
<v ->Exactly. Exactly.</v>

1020
00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:57.280
If you close your eyes and you open them,

1021
00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.760
you tune into that space in the back of your heart

1022
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:02.280
you bring your awareness into that space

1023
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.440
and then you open your eyes

1024
00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.820
and you start to look at an object,

1025
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.200
from that space,

1026
00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.400
<v Voiceover>It's like you go into instant resonance.</v>

1027
00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:11.560
<v ->Instant resonance.</v>

1028
00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:15.850
Because it's a portal to oneness.

1029
00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:20.379
To your essential nature, to presence,

1030
00:47:20.379 --> 00:47:24.430
all these terms that represent unity,

1031
00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.160
awareness, essentially.

1032
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.450
And it's so easy to do.

1033
00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:31.020
This is what I have developed

1034
00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:34.040
and I teach in my seminars and workshops now,

1035
00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:37.040
which I'm giving around the world.

1036
00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.460
<v Voiceover>Yeah, you've progressed this work,</v>

1037
00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:39.520
let's talk about that.

1038
00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.400
Because I highly recommend, everybody just go

1039
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.159
to your site, pick up a copy of the book

1040
00:47:44.159 --> 00:47:46.300
so you can be guided through all of this

1041
00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.740
because we would be talking for days

1042
00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:50.560
to cover everything in this book

1043
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.260
and all of the tools that you're offering us.

1044
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.420
So let's talk about where you're going

1045
00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:55.360
with it now.

1046
00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:59.060
<v ->Yeah, well, I realize that we're here</v>

1047
00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:00.680
for a short period of time,

1048
00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.840
even if it's a hundred years

1049
00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.900
or if they extend our life here

1050
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.681
on earth for 150 years.

1051
00:48:10.681 --> 00:48:13.171
It's a short time.

1052
00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:15.060
We're essentially born to live,

1053
00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.200
but we were also born to die.

1054
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.580
But is there a part of us that's immortal,

1055
00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:24.459
that was never born and never dies

1056
00:48:24.459 --> 00:48:27.060
that just passes through this body?

1057
00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:31.810
This loving awareness is what we might talk about,

1058
00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:33.799
this loving awareness.

1059
00:48:33.799 --> 00:48:38.539
And so I decided that the progression of my work

1060
00:48:38.539 --> 00:48:42.550
is to really heal into wholeness through love,

1061
00:48:43.579 --> 00:48:46.130
through that awareness of unity.

1062
00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.139
And you know, it's interesting

1063
00:48:48.139 --> 00:48:51.420
because there are a number of paths

1064
00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:52.580
to wholeness.

1065
00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:54.940
One of the paths is through love,

1066
00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:57.450
another is through truth.

1067
00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:03.929
And this path of so-called action,

1068
00:49:04.519 --> 00:49:07.398
just doing good deeds, service,

1069
00:49:07.398 --> 00:49:08.979
doing good deeds.

1070
00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:12.099
The yogic path, so to speak.

1071
00:49:12.099 --> 00:49:15.219
But I realized as I was starting to explore this

1072
00:49:15.219 --> 00:49:19.789
that I know that love seeks unity,

1073
00:49:20.619 --> 00:49:24.629
and in the same way, knowing seeks truth.

1074
00:49:27.579 --> 00:49:30.999
What we're interest in when we look at knowing

1075
00:49:30.999 --> 00:49:34.469
is we're not interested in knowing falsehood,

1076
00:49:34.819 --> 00:49:36.599
because falsehood doesn't exist.

1077
00:49:36.599 --> 00:49:38.419
We're only interested in knowing truth

1078
00:49:38.419 --> 00:49:41.909
so loving seeks truth.

1079
00:49:43.738 --> 00:49:47.879
It's searching, it's seeking, it's desiring,

1080
00:49:47.879 --> 00:49:50.699
as we mentioned before, desire involves movement,

1081
00:49:50.699 --> 00:49:53.819
there's a movement toward unity,

1082
00:49:53.819 --> 00:49:58.819
there's an impulse to merge, subject-object into one

1083
00:49:59.759 --> 00:50:01.499
so that there's no longer a subject,

1084
00:50:01.499 --> 00:50:03.979
no longer an object, there's only one.

1085
00:50:03.979 --> 00:50:06.119
That's what love does.

1086
00:50:06.119 --> 00:50:07.378
<v Voiceover>No better immune system booster,</v>

1087
00:50:07.378 --> 00:50:08.178
that's for sure.

1088
00:50:08.178 --> 00:50:09.818
(laughs)

1089
00:50:09.818 --> 00:50:14.377
<v ->But once love finds</v>

1090
00:50:14.377 --> 00:50:16.256
the unity that it seeks,

1091
00:50:16.256 --> 00:50:19.497
all movement toward unity stops

1092
00:50:19.497 --> 00:50:22.307
and what's left is stillness,

1093
00:50:22.817 --> 00:50:24.677
just that stillness.

1094
00:50:24.677 --> 00:50:28.827
And the same thing with knowing.

1095
00:50:29.117 --> 00:50:31.306
Knowing is seeking truth.

1096
00:50:31.357 --> 00:50:35.336
And when it finds that truth, it moves toward that truth,

1097
00:50:35.336 --> 00:50:39.907
all seeking the truth stops.

1098
00:50:40.997 --> 00:50:43.577
And there's only that same stillness,

1099
00:50:43.577 --> 00:50:45.947
that's why Jesus said,

1100
00:50:49.537 --> 00:50:51.437
"Truth will set you free."

1101
00:50:51.437 --> 00:50:54.457
Even if it's the truth that you have cancer,

1102
00:50:54.457 --> 00:50:56.797
or that you're going to die in a minute,

1103
00:50:56.797 --> 00:50:59.996
it's the most amazing thing when you finally accept

1104
00:50:59.996 --> 00:51:03.547
instead of resist the truth.

1105
00:51:04.037 --> 00:51:05.687
You're free.

1106
00:51:06.338 --> 00:51:10.507
And another word for that stillness is peace.

1107
00:51:10.797 --> 00:51:14.077
Another word for that stillness is joy.

1108
00:51:15.737 --> 00:51:19.215
That stillness is beyond quality

1109
00:51:19.215 --> 00:51:21.996
it's beyond description or words,

1110
00:51:21.996 --> 00:51:26.236
and yet, when we want to describe it as an experience

1111
00:51:26.236 --> 00:51:28.176
when we have an experience of that which is beyond

1112
00:51:28.176 --> 00:51:31.366
experience, we use these words,

1113
00:51:31.696 --> 00:51:36.566
freedom, peace, joy, oneness, love.

1114
00:51:37.136 --> 00:51:40.056
We're all using all these words to describe that which

1115
00:51:40.056 --> 00:51:42.186
is beyond description.

1116
00:51:42.196 --> 00:51:47.196
But the fact is, it's all, they all lead to the one.

1117
00:51:48.596 --> 00:51:50.956
Truth and, at the highest level,

1118
00:51:50.956 --> 00:51:53.866
truth and love are one.

1119
00:51:54.736 --> 00:51:58.336
So we have different ways, and it's not an exclusive path,

1120
00:51:58.336 --> 00:52:03.336
people combine truth and love and service,

1121
00:52:04.796 --> 00:52:08.096
and everyone has their unique way of experiencing,

1122
00:52:08.096 --> 00:52:10.435
expressing that oneness.

1123
00:52:10.435 --> 00:52:12.136
<v Voiceover>Well you certainly have your unique way</v>

1124
00:52:12.136 --> 00:52:14.235
of doing it and you're doing some profound good

1125
00:52:14.235 --> 00:52:15.096
on the planet.

1126
00:52:15.096 --> 00:52:18.276
Again, we'll put everybody in touch with your work

1127
00:52:18.276 --> 00:52:19.096
so they can find out,

1128
00:52:19.096 --> 00:52:21.836
because you're doing quite a few lectures

1129
00:52:21.836 --> 00:52:23.216
and workshops now,

1130
00:52:23.216 --> 00:52:25.736
and with the new work that you've progressed into.

1131
00:52:25.736 --> 00:52:27.796
And I have to say, just sitting here with you,

1132
00:52:27.796 --> 00:52:31.276
it's almost hard to be engaged in a conversation with you

1133
00:52:31.276 --> 00:52:34.195
because you have this profound energy

1134
00:52:34.195 --> 00:52:37.796
that automatically moves me into resonance with you

1135
00:52:37.796 --> 00:52:39.756
to where it's almost a hypnotic state.

1136
00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:41.436
A very expansive hypnotic state.

1137
00:52:41.436 --> 00:52:44.096
It's like, I could just sit here and stare at you

1138
00:52:44.096 --> 00:52:46.296
the entire time and not say a word.

1139
00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:48.156
<v ->Sure, it's oneness, it's oneness.</v>

1140
00:52:48.156 --> 00:52:50.756
<v Voiceover>Yes, you have a very, very lovely energy.</v>

1141
00:52:50.756 --> 00:52:51.675
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1142
00:52:51.675 --> 00:52:54.476
<v Voiceover>Obviously that's why that night</v>

1143
00:52:54.476 --> 00:52:57.776
when they said, whether you're any more important

1144
00:52:57.776 --> 00:53:00.276
or not, or worthy than the rest

1145
00:53:00.276 --> 00:53:04.036
you certainly had the capability of opening profoundly

1146
00:53:04.036 --> 00:53:06.356
into this understanding of resonance

1147
00:53:06.356 --> 00:53:08.435
and beyond into love and unity.

1148
00:53:08.435 --> 00:53:10.616
So I see why you're the one they tapped on the shoulder

1149
00:53:10.616 --> 00:53:13.596
and said, "You will be healing with love."

1150
00:53:13.596 --> 00:53:16.536
So with that said, we'll turn everybody onto your work here

1151
00:53:16.536 --> 00:53:18.956
and thank you so much for the time,

1152
00:53:18.956 --> 00:53:21.256
I just really enjoyed sitting with you.

1153
00:53:21.256 --> 00:53:22.136
<v ->It was the same.</v>

1154
00:53:22.136 --> 00:53:24.416
It was like sitting with oneself.

1155
00:53:26.946 --> 00:53:28.325
Thank you.

1156
00:53:29.115 --> 00:53:31.355
<v ->Dr. Laskow's book, Healing with Love</v>

1157
00:53:31.355 --> 00:53:33.835
is available through Amazon and other booksellers.

1158
00:53:33.835 --> 00:53:36.295
It details how each one of us can tap into this

1159
00:53:36.295 --> 00:53:38.474
field of resonance and love for healing

1160
00:53:38.474 --> 00:53:39.895
our own lives and bodies,

1161
00:53:39.895 --> 00:53:41.175
and those of others.

1162
00:53:41.175 --> 00:53:44.085
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
