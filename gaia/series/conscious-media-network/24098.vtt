1
00:00:00.491 --> 00:00:01.971
<v ->Imagine lying in your bed,</v>

2
00:00:01.971 --> 00:00:03.811
and suddenly becoming paralyzed,

3
00:00:04.251 --> 00:00:07.945
and transported to a time 5,000 years into the future,

4
00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:09.865
where you're experiencing life through the eyes

5
00:00:09.865 --> 00:00:11.555
and body of a stranger.

6
00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:12.726
Well, this is what happened

7
00:00:12.726 --> 00:00:14.566
to anthropologist Hank Wesselman,

8
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.026
a scientist who spent 25 years

9
00:00:17.026 --> 00:00:18.566
working in the fossil beds,

10
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.786
at the East Africa's Rift Valley,

11
00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:22.476
alongside the Leakey family.

12
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:24.787
These visionary experiences

13
00:00:24.787 --> 00:00:26.729
put him on an entirely new path,

14
00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:29.089
in his investigations into the evolution

15
00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:31.279
of human beings and our consciousness,

16
00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.351
both from the past,

17
00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:33.981
and into the future.

18
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:44.991
Your background is that as an anthropologist,

19
00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:46.651
and paleontologist.

20
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:50.497
But not an ordinary story, academically or otherwise,

21
00:00:50.497 --> 00:00:53.339
because you began having some experiences

22
00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:55.519
that were really quite extraordinary,

23
00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.939
that started taking you and your work

24
00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:01.449
in an entirely new direction, or a parallel direction.

25
00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.939
And this is chronicled in your book "Spiritwalker,"

26
00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:05.539
which I read several years ago.

27
00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:07.740
Fantastic book, very engaging.

28
00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.420
What happened that began this path of your work?

29
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.770
<v ->Well, in those days, back in the early 70's,</v>

30
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.370
I got into anthropology,

31
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.762
and for the past 30 years or so,

32
00:01:20.762 --> 00:01:23.262
I've been a member of a team of scientists,

33
00:01:23.512 --> 00:01:25.755
investigating those eroded landscapes

34
00:01:25.755 --> 00:01:28.235
of the Great Rift Valley in Eastern Africa,

35
00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:30.019
looking for the evidence,

36
00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:33.225
for the earliest ancestors of humanity.

37
00:01:33.975 --> 00:01:35.615
We've essentially been looking for the missing link,

38
00:01:35.615 --> 00:01:38.145
that Charles Darwin said we would eventually find.

39
00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:41.535
And so, in the early 70's, I was drawn into this work,

40
00:01:41.535 --> 00:01:43.717
as a graduate student out of UC Berkeley.

41
00:01:44.523 --> 00:01:46.839
And, I found myself rubbing elbows with

42
00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:49.143
individuals like Louis and Mary Leakey,

43
00:01:49.143 --> 00:01:50.639
and their son Richard,

44
00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:53.609
Don Johanson, the man who would later find Lucy.

45
00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.305
And I was operating at the highest levels of science.

46
00:01:57.015 --> 00:01:59.802
But it was out there in the deserts of Southwestern Ethiopia

47
00:01:59.802 --> 00:02:02.250
that I began to have what could broadly be called

48
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.252
"visionary experiences".

49
00:02:04.818 --> 00:02:06.882
Now in those days, I had no idea

50
00:02:06.882 --> 00:02:09.316
what visionary experiences were.

51
00:02:09.767 --> 00:02:11.471
You know, I wasn't one of those individuals

52
00:02:11.471 --> 00:02:13.523
who studied for years

53
00:02:13.523 --> 00:02:15.495
at the knees of the wisdom masters,

54
00:02:15.495 --> 00:02:17.236
practicing meditation and yoga,

55
00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:19.602
hoping for transcendent experiences.

56
00:02:19.602 --> 00:02:21.243
You know, this was not my path.

57
00:02:21.243 --> 00:02:23.800
I worshiped solely at the altar of science.

58
00:02:24.237 --> 00:02:28.542
And so, when these early epiphanies occurred for me,

59
00:02:28.542 --> 00:02:30.036
out in the bush in Africa,

60
00:02:30.506 --> 00:02:31.854
I took note of them.

61
00:02:32.254 --> 00:02:34.257
I thought about them a great deal.

62
00:02:34.295 --> 00:02:36.647
And I kind of made cryptic notes in my journals.

63
00:02:36.647 --> 00:02:38.466
This isn't the sort of thing you share with your colleagues

64
00:02:38.466 --> 00:02:41.316
in the field of Paleo-Anthropology, alright?

65
00:02:42.236 --> 00:02:44.353
10 years later, in Berkeley,

66
00:02:44.353 --> 00:02:46.505
I had finished my doctoral dissertation.

67
00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:48.337
I'd gotten my PhD.

68
00:02:48.977 --> 00:02:51.798
I was converting my dissertation into a monograph,

69
00:02:51.798 --> 00:02:53.707
which was published in Switzerland.

70
00:02:54.778 --> 00:02:56.450
And one morning at dawn,

71
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:00.764
on the heels of a joyous marital encounter...

72
00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:04.055
<v Regina>Okay, I know what you're talking about.</v>

73
00:03:04.055 --> 00:03:04.751
<v ->Okay?</v>

74
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:06.365
At four o'clock in the morning,

75
00:03:06.365 --> 00:03:10.013
I was precipitated into a visionary state of consciousness,

76
00:03:10.493 --> 00:03:13.512
which was quite frightening initially, because,

77
00:03:13.512 --> 00:03:15.977
suddenly, my physical body was invaded,

78
00:03:15.977 --> 00:03:19.675
by feelings of power or force, or pressure.

79
00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:22.579
It was like I was inside an invisible fist,

80
00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:23.957
which was squeezing.

81
00:03:24.523 --> 00:03:27.665
And I discovered my body was completely paralyzed.

82
00:03:27.933 --> 00:03:30.307
I couldn't even breathe effectively.

83
00:03:30.307 --> 00:03:32.429
I remember gulping for air.

84
00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.691
And as my eyelids fluttered, my room disappeared.

85
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:40.246
I'm lying in bed next to my wife, while this is going on.

86
00:03:40.926 --> 00:03:45.663
And I find myself in this dark forest at night.

87
00:03:45.663 --> 00:03:46.711
Black on black.

88
00:03:46.711 --> 00:03:49.987
I could see trees against the blackness of the night.

89
00:03:49.987 --> 00:03:53.867
And I could smell this very sweet scent,

90
00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:56.579
that suggested flowering trees.

91
00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.728
And I'm hear-- you know,

92
00:03:58.728 --> 00:04:01.726
I can feel these enormous feelings of power.

93
00:04:01.726 --> 00:04:04.630
I mean, it's-- you know, the word ecstasy doesn't come close

94
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.680
to what this really felt like.

95
00:04:07.774 --> 00:04:09.594
But my curiosity clicked on.

96
00:04:09.952 --> 00:04:13.414
I discovered my intentions, my thoughts,

97
00:04:13.414 --> 00:04:15.406
were enough to move me here and there.

98
00:04:15.406 --> 00:04:16.732
If I wanted to see something,

99
00:04:17.092 --> 00:04:19.651
I would drift in that direction, and I would see it.

100
00:04:20.221 --> 00:04:21.474
It was in this state,

101
00:04:21.474 --> 00:04:23.226
that I was brought face to face

102
00:04:23.226 --> 00:04:25.540
with what indigenous tribal people would call

103
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.258
a "spirit".

104
00:04:28.244 --> 00:04:30.099
Now, nothing in my training at UC Berkeley

105
00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:31.792
prepared me for this experience.

106
00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:32.700
(Regina chuckles)

107
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.524
Alright?

108
00:04:33.953 --> 00:04:36.435
I was face to face with something truly formidable.

109
00:04:36.435 --> 00:04:38.705
It looked like a gigantic shadow.

110
00:04:39.465 --> 00:04:41.997
I was aware of Jung's concept of the shadow.

111
00:04:41.997 --> 00:04:43.753
This was not a projection of myself,

112
00:04:43.753 --> 00:04:45.051
I knew quite clearly.

113
00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:47.471
This was a large, tall silhouette,

114
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:49.498
that looked somewhat like a keyhole,

115
00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:51.720
with a little head at the top, shoulders,

116
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.654
and then went all the way down to the ground.

117
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.779
I was face to face with this thing,

118
00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:00.251
and the thought occurred to me that this,

119
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:01.057
whatever it was,

120
00:05:01.057 --> 00:05:02.663
could be the source of the sensations

121
00:05:02.663 --> 00:05:04.079
that I was experiencing.

122
00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:08.435
With that thought, the (mumbles) was turned up, alright?

123
00:05:08.435 --> 00:05:11.104
And I found myself lifted off the ground,

124
00:05:11.104 --> 00:05:13.106
and gently rotated in space,

125
00:05:13.106 --> 00:05:15.592
with lightning flashing out of my fingertips

126
00:05:15.592 --> 00:05:16.832
and off my shoulders.

127
00:05:18.012 --> 00:05:19.732
It coulda been very frightening,

128
00:05:19.732 --> 00:05:21.290
if I wasn't so curious.

129
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.048
I mean, this is what has been my cross to bear.

130
00:05:23.048 --> 00:05:25.713
This is what got me in to science, my curiosity.

131
00:05:25.713 --> 00:05:26.766
I'm a scholar.

132
00:05:28.486 --> 00:05:31.341
This episode came to an end.

133
00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:34.714
And it peaked my curiosity beyond anything else

134
00:05:34.714 --> 00:05:36.264
I'd experienced in my life.

135
00:05:36.264 --> 00:05:38.385
I mean, when you've had the direct experience of spirit,

136
00:05:38.385 --> 00:05:39.562
everything is different.

137
00:05:40.255 --> 00:05:41.679
I had another one, a week later.

138
00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.985
And then a real beauty, about six months later,

139
00:05:44.985 --> 00:05:47.086
just to make sure I was paying attention.

140
00:05:47.242 --> 00:05:50.517
On which, I was taken on a cosmic tour of the universe.

141
00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:53.150
I was taken places and shown things,

142
00:05:53.495 --> 00:05:54.902
which were clearly not here.

143
00:05:54.902 --> 00:05:57.080
They're clearly, if we could use this term,

144
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.826
extraterrestrial.

145
00:05:59.412 --> 00:06:01.788
I was shown extraterrestrial life forms.

146
00:06:01.788 --> 00:06:03.591
Extraterrestrial landscapes.

147
00:06:03.972 --> 00:06:05.494
And at the end of this experience,

148
00:06:05.494 --> 00:06:07.946
I was brought back to my body.

149
00:06:08.232 --> 00:06:09.424
My body wasn't going anywhere.

150
00:06:09.424 --> 00:06:11.416
This was my mind, which was flying.

151
00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.253
I was brought back to my body,

152
00:06:13.253 --> 00:06:14.934
in bed, in Berkeley,

153
00:06:14.934 --> 00:06:16.685
on a foggy Berkeley morning.

154
00:06:17.475 --> 00:06:20.008
And, nothing was ever quite the same,

155
00:06:20.008 --> 00:06:21.648
for me, again, after that.

156
00:06:22.502 --> 00:06:24.158
Now, having had these experiences,

157
00:06:24.158 --> 00:06:25.392
I wanted more.

158
00:06:25.766 --> 00:06:27.746
And I wanted it from direct experience.

159
00:06:27.746 --> 00:06:28.934
I didn't wanna read about it.

160
00:06:28.934 --> 00:06:30.384
I wanted to have it.

161
00:06:30.758 --> 00:06:32.592
But I couldn't seem to turn it on again.

162
00:06:33.158 --> 00:06:35.702
Now I took a lot of workshops in Shamanism.

163
00:06:35.702 --> 00:06:37.992
I knew about Shamans, by this time.

164
00:06:37.992 --> 00:06:40.022
As an anthropologist, I would know that.

165
00:06:40.772 --> 00:06:42.130
Now, in the Western world,

166
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.504
when we use the word "shaman," most of us tend to conjure up

167
00:06:45.504 --> 00:06:49.186
an image of a masked and tribal person,

168
00:06:49.186 --> 00:06:51.266
dancing around the fire in the dark,

169
00:06:51.526 --> 00:06:54.115
involved in some mysterious ritual,

170
00:06:54.475 --> 00:06:55.968
accompanied by drum beats.

171
00:06:55.968 --> 00:06:57.658
And that's not a bad description.

172
00:06:58.506 --> 00:07:00.825
But the mask, the costume, the ritual,

173
00:07:00.825 --> 00:07:02.803
these are all cultural things.

174
00:07:03.297 --> 00:07:05.652
And inside that cultural shell,

175
00:07:06.761 --> 00:07:08.738
there's an individual, a man or a woman,

176
00:07:08.738 --> 00:07:10.884
who has a set of very real skills.

177
00:07:11.786 --> 00:07:13.466
Now, all true Shamans

178
00:07:14.246 --> 00:07:16.877
learn or discover that they have this ability

179
00:07:16.877 --> 00:07:19.887
to achieve these expanded awareness states.

180
00:07:20.213 --> 00:07:21.797
We could call then trance states.

181
00:07:21.797 --> 00:07:24.109
But I don't tend to use the word trance, because,

182
00:07:24.109 --> 00:07:26.631
trance implies that you're unconscious.

183
00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:28.902
And this is quite the reverse.

184
00:07:29.225 --> 00:07:32.045
In these states, I was super-conscious.

185
00:07:32.045 --> 00:07:33.321
I was super-conscious.

186
00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:34.997
My consciousness expanded,

187
00:07:34.997 --> 00:07:36.917
beyond my wildest imaginings.

188
00:07:37.483 --> 00:07:39.474
Well, this is what typifies the Shaman.

189
00:07:39.474 --> 00:07:42.505
The Shaman achieves these expanded awareness states.

190
00:07:43.489 --> 00:07:44.629
And it's in these states,

191
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:46.837
that they disassociate their conscious awareness,

192
00:07:46.837 --> 00:07:48.719
away from their physical body.

193
00:07:49.237 --> 00:07:52.405
And literally enter into, or journey into,

194
00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:53.885
an alternate reality,

195
00:07:53.885 --> 00:07:56.535
which indigenous people call the "Spirit World".

196
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:58.061
They call it the Spirit World,

197
00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.823
because they encounter spirits there.

198
00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:01.253
The spirits of nature,

199
00:08:01.253 --> 00:08:02.285
the spirits of animals,

200
00:08:02.285 --> 00:08:04.016
the spirits of plants,

201
00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:08.165
the spirits of higher divine beings,

202
00:08:08.165 --> 00:08:09.615
the angelic forces,

203
00:08:09.845 --> 00:08:11.957
those compassionate beings who are poised,

204
00:08:11.957 --> 00:08:14.245
just beyond the edges of the reality,

205
00:08:14.245 --> 00:08:16.047
that we all take so much for granted.

206
00:08:16.205 --> 00:08:18.351
Poised to help us in various ways.

207
00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:19.909
In other words, these are

208
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:22.877
ancient human archetypal experiences,

209
00:08:23.497 --> 00:08:26.849
which the rich diversity of cave and rock art reveals

210
00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:29.907
has been going on for at least 40 to 50,000 years.

211
00:08:31.073 --> 00:08:33.995
Now, I sensed that I was being drawn in this direction,

212
00:08:33.995 --> 00:08:37.261
so I began to take workshops in Shamanism,

213
00:08:37.261 --> 00:08:40.098
and I learned that the Shaman is really a public servant.

214
00:08:41.498 --> 00:08:43.485
The Shaman is able to do various things,

215
00:08:43.485 --> 00:08:44.790
on behalf of others.

216
00:08:45.404 --> 00:08:47.766
Restore power to those who've lost it.

217
00:08:47.973 --> 00:08:50.539
They're able to access information through divination,

218
00:08:50.539 --> 00:08:51.593
from these spirits.

219
00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:53.695
Information of meaning to their client,

220
00:08:53.695 --> 00:08:55.121
who comes to them for help.

221
00:08:55.807 --> 00:08:58.003
They're able to do healing work on various levels,

222
00:08:58.003 --> 00:09:02.301
physical, spiritual, mental, emotional and energetic.

223
00:09:02.991 --> 00:09:04.471
And initially, of course,

224
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:07.459
as we get drawn into this unusual practice,

225
00:09:08.499 --> 00:09:12.311
we access this experience on behalf of ourselves.

226
00:09:12.311 --> 00:09:14.159
But we find ourselves, ultimately,

227
00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:17.145
drawn in the direction of being of service for others.

228
00:09:17.145 --> 00:09:18.908
And the Spiritwalker story,

229
00:09:18.908 --> 00:09:21.884
is really the story of how I was drawn into this world.

230
00:09:22.764 --> 00:09:24.889
Now, when I lived in Hawaii, right?

231
00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:26.713
This is really the core of that book.

232
00:09:27.763 --> 00:09:30.348
One morning, at four o'clock in the morning,

233
00:09:30.768 --> 00:09:32.211
two, three years later,

234
00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:36.421
the feelings of paralysis appeared in my body once again.

235
00:09:37.563 --> 00:09:39.061
Now, I was waiting for this.

236
00:09:39.723 --> 00:09:41.297
I'd been trying to turn this on again,

237
00:09:42.007 --> 00:09:44.243
for almost three years.

238
00:09:44.243 --> 00:09:45.749
I was waiting for this.

239
00:09:45.952 --> 00:09:49.850
And when it happened, there was a side of me that said,

240
00:09:50.501 --> 00:09:51.458
"Yes!"

241
00:09:51.976 --> 00:09:53.176
You know, that's how I felt.

242
00:09:53.506 --> 00:09:55.823
Now, my conscious awareness, once again,

243
00:09:55.823 --> 00:09:58.009
was drawn out of my physical body,

244
00:09:58.009 --> 00:10:00.158
and I found myself traveling

245
00:10:00.468 --> 00:10:03.547
through this inter-dimensional latticework.

246
00:10:03.957 --> 00:10:08.434
It looked like a matrix, or a grid, or a spider web perhaps.

247
00:10:08.434 --> 00:10:09.263
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

248
00:10:09.263 --> 00:10:10.528
<v ->And it was made of light.</v>

249
00:10:10.528 --> 00:10:13.969
And I seemed to be traveling along a line of light,

250
00:10:13.969 --> 00:10:17.180
towards one of these curious light objects,

251
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.433
that looked very much like the new moon,

252
00:10:19.944 --> 00:10:21.536
in the sense that it was a crescent,

253
00:10:21.536 --> 00:10:22.871
that began to open.

254
00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:24.301
And as the crescent opened,

255
00:10:24.301 --> 00:10:26.005
I began to head right for it, and--

256
00:10:26.005 --> 00:10:27.061
(snaps fingers)

257
00:10:27.471 --> 00:10:29.512
I went through, and I blacked out.

258
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:31.244
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

259
00:10:31.244 --> 00:10:34.253
<v ->Now, when my conscious awareness clicked on again,</v>

260
00:10:35.753 --> 00:10:37.778
I was in somebody else's body.

261
00:10:38.752 --> 00:10:40.514
<v Regina>Whose, and where, and when?</v>

262
00:10:41.008 --> 00:10:43.005
<v ->Well, this is where it gets really tricky.</v>

263
00:10:43.005 --> 00:10:43.769
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

264
00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:45.415
<v ->I wasn't prepared for this experience.</v>

265
00:10:45.755 --> 00:10:47.948
And my first impulse was shock.

266
00:10:48.778 --> 00:10:51.154
Now, my limited experience with meditation--

267
00:10:51.154 --> 00:10:55.738
I was a very poor Zen student, for about 25 years.

268
00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:58.138
I say, poor Zen student, because I never really developed

269
00:10:58.138 --> 00:11:00.032
the discipline to go sit in the Zen dome.

270
00:11:00.032 --> 00:11:02.406
My business has been out there in the world at large.

271
00:11:03.502 --> 00:11:05.927
But my experience with meditation allowed me

272
00:11:05.927 --> 00:11:07.775
to become completely passive,

273
00:11:07.775 --> 00:11:09.175
and to sit quietly within,

274
00:11:09.775 --> 00:11:11.350
and look out through this man's eyes,

275
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.280
at a world I had never seen before.

276
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.191
I discovered almost immediately,

277
00:11:15.191 --> 00:11:17.927
that I could access his thoughts, his emotions,

278
00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:20.361
his feelings, his memories, his judgments.

279
00:11:20.687 --> 00:11:22.596
I began to track his thought train,

280
00:11:22.596 --> 00:11:24.504
as though I cou-- or my own.

281
00:11:25.244 --> 00:11:27.972
Now, he was unaware of the fact that I was there.

282
00:11:29.242 --> 00:11:30.419
At that time.

283
00:11:30.419 --> 00:11:31.161
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

284
00:11:31.161 --> 00:11:31.745
<v ->In the beginning.</v>

285
00:11:31.745 --> 00:11:33.144
He was unaware of me.

286
00:11:33.567 --> 00:11:37.089
This man is a man of Hawaiian ancestry.

287
00:11:37.492 --> 00:11:39.262
But he's not living in Hawaii.

288
00:11:39.262 --> 00:11:42.278
He's living somewhere on the coast of Western North America,

289
00:11:42.748 --> 00:11:45.424
in a slice of time which is different from this one.

290
00:11:46.478 --> 00:11:48.859
If I've got this right, and I believe I do,

291
00:11:49.238 --> 00:11:53.409
this man lives in a time 247 generations

292
00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:56.270
after the collapse of Western civilization.

293
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.012
After the collapse of the world

294
00:11:58.012 --> 00:11:59.654
that we all take so much for granted.

295
00:11:59.884 --> 00:12:01.255
Now, if you multiply this out,

296
00:12:01.255 --> 00:12:04.569
this comes out to, roughly, 5,000 years.

297
00:12:05.729 --> 00:12:06.944
If I've got this right,

298
00:12:07.694 --> 00:12:09.587
I was having a look at the future,

299
00:12:09.587 --> 00:12:12.149
5,000 years into the future,

300
00:12:12.517 --> 00:12:15.194
through the eyes and soul of a man,

301
00:12:16.485 --> 00:12:20.320
who seemed very familiar to me, in the beginning.

302
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.209
Now, in this first episode, I was merged with this man,

303
00:12:24.209 --> 00:12:25.779
for 18 hours of his time,

304
00:12:26.129 --> 00:12:28.121
as he was leaving his community,

305
00:12:28.741 --> 00:12:32.586
and engaging on a voyage of geographic investigation,

306
00:12:32.586 --> 00:12:36.004
into the interior of the lost continent of America.

307
00:12:36.378 --> 00:12:38.970
Now, when I talk about this with big conferences,

308
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.202
there's still a side of Hank Wesselman, the scientist,

309
00:12:41.202 --> 00:12:42.498
that steps back and says,

310
00:12:42.498 --> 00:12:44.826
"Hank, did you really say that to these people?

311
00:12:44.826 --> 00:12:48.042
"Time traveling, involved with spirit possession.

312
00:12:48.042 --> 00:12:49.986
"Possessing another man's body,

313
00:12:49.986 --> 00:12:52.640
"looking out through his eyes and soul at another world?"

314
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.474
<v Regina>I'll bet the quantum physicists are saying,</v>

315
00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:57.756
"Entirely possible, not just possible, probable,

316
00:12:57.756 --> 00:13:01.752
"that time is not linear, and to be able to experience

317
00:13:01.752 --> 00:13:04.506
"an existence in the past or the future or the present

318
00:13:04.506 --> 00:13:06.100
"is all one," right?

319
00:13:06.186 --> 00:13:08.346
<v ->Well I didn't know very much about the quantum world then.</v>

320
00:13:08.346 --> 00:13:08.850
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

321
00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.500
<v ->I didn't know about the zero point field, for example.</v>

322
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.254
<v Regina>Yes, exactly.</v>

323
00:13:11.254 --> 00:13:13.776
<v ->And that's the field I was accessing, to find this man.</v>

324
00:13:13.776 --> 00:13:14.524
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

325
00:13:14.634 --> 00:13:16.811
<v ->Now, Spiritwalker is the story</v>

326
00:13:16.811 --> 00:13:20.404
of how I had 12 of these episodes over a four year period,

327
00:13:20.404 --> 00:13:22.238
while living on my farm in Hawaii.

328
00:13:22.876 --> 00:13:26.230
So, in a sense, the whole story takes place in Hawaii.

329
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.660
But it also takes place in the future,

330
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.763
as this man engages this-- in this extraordinary journey,

331
00:13:32.763 --> 00:13:35.483
across the wilderness of North America,

332
00:13:36.253 --> 00:13:40.257
and finds the descendants of our once great civilization.

333
00:13:40.257 --> 00:13:41.207
He finds them.

334
00:13:41.207 --> 00:13:42.740
Now, I wouldn't dream of spoiling this

335
00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.252
interesting story for your readers because this is all

336
00:13:45.252 --> 00:13:48.244
very carefully laid-out in this book Spiritwalker,

337
00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:50.760
in which I try to weave together

338
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.250
these numinous epiphanies,

339
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.172
with my ordinary life,

340
00:13:55.172 --> 00:13:57.764
looking for patterns of reason and causality.

341
00:13:57.764 --> 00:13:58.504
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

342
00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:00.331
See, the scientist is always trying to figure it out.

343
00:14:00.331 --> 00:14:01.243
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

344
00:14:01.483 --> 00:14:04.709
<v ->And so, that book is really my personal journal,</v>

345
00:14:04.709 --> 00:14:06.501
of my Shamanic initiation crisis.

346
00:14:06.501 --> 00:14:08.257
<v Regina>It's a fabulous book, mmhmm.</v>

347
00:14:08.257 --> 00:14:10.787
<v ->The second book in the trilogy, Medicinemaker,</v>

348
00:14:10.787 --> 00:14:12.775
is about how I became a Medicine Man.

349
00:14:12.775 --> 00:14:14.223
It's really about my recovery.

350
00:14:14.733 --> 00:14:17.713
And the third book, Visionseeker, is about training.

351
00:14:17.713 --> 00:14:20.237
It's about my training in the Shamanic tradition,

352
00:14:20.237 --> 00:14:23.292
and Nainoa's training in the Kahuna tradition.

353
00:14:23.714 --> 00:14:27.058
And these books contain a lot of secret knowledge,

354
00:14:27.725 --> 00:14:29.904
of the Kahuna mystics of Polynesia,

355
00:14:29.904 --> 00:14:32.246
which is not generally published.

356
00:14:33.476 --> 00:14:36.328
Now, this brings us to a very sticky point.

357
00:14:36.498 --> 00:14:38.296
I was aware, in publishing these books,

358
00:14:38.296 --> 00:14:39.974
that I was trespassing.

359
00:14:40.467 --> 00:14:42.340
<v Regina>Trespassing on ancient and</v>

360
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.828
closed tradition? Or what?

361
00:14:43.828 --> 00:14:46.588
<v ->I was sharing knowledge from the Kahuna tradition--</v>

362
00:14:46.588 --> 00:14:47.278
<v Regina>Yes, right.</v>

363
00:14:47.278 --> 00:14:48.372
<v ->which has never been--</v>

364
00:14:48.372 --> 00:14:49.058
much of which has never been published.

365
00:14:49.058 --> 00:14:50.242
<v Regina>Right, yes.</v>

366
00:14:50.502 --> 00:14:52.698
<v ->And I knew that sooner or later,</v>

367
00:14:53.493 --> 00:14:56.672
the Kahunas were gonna come to look me over,

368
00:14:56.672 --> 00:14:58.026
to see if I was real.

369
00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.672
<v Regina>And?</v>

370
00:14:59.672 --> 00:15:02.301
<v ->Well, Spiritwalker came out in 1995,</v>

371
00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:03.501
and it made a huge splash.

372
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:06.311
In fact, it's been published in 13 languages abroad.

373
00:15:07.261 --> 00:15:11.281
In 1996, I was invited to speak at an institute in Hawaii,

374
00:15:11.281 --> 00:15:12.643
the New Millennium Institute,

375
00:15:12.643 --> 00:15:14.918
which, at that time, was based in a Frank Lloyd Wright house

376
00:15:14.918 --> 00:15:17.530
on the big island of Hawaii, up in Waimea,

377
00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.392
where the Parker Ranch is headquartered.

378
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.498
They heard about me,

379
00:15:21.498 --> 00:15:23.376
and they invited me to come and speak.

380
00:15:24.254 --> 00:15:26.028
So I checked it out, you know.

381
00:15:26.028 --> 00:15:27.737
I usually check things like this out,

382
00:15:27.737 --> 00:15:31.502
with my spirits, who wander around with me now,

383
00:15:31.502 --> 00:15:33.576
advising me as teachers and helpers.

384
00:15:33.854 --> 00:15:36.062
So I just kind of turned my attention in their direction,

385
00:15:36.062 --> 00:15:37.536
and they gave it the thumbs up.

386
00:15:38.126 --> 00:15:40.023
So my wife Jill and I left our kids

387
00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:41.630
at the Kanoa Beach Hotel.

388
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:42.806
You know, you can do that in Hawaii.

389
00:15:42.806 --> 00:15:44.678
I just alerted the staff that the children were

390
00:15:44.678 --> 00:15:46.494
going to be at the hotel for the day, and,

391
00:15:46.494 --> 00:15:48.150
don't give them too much in the way of dessert.

392
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.198
And they, the whole hotel, took care of our kids.

393
00:15:50.198 --> 00:15:50.798
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

394
00:15:50.798 --> 00:15:52.142
<v ->So we went up to Waimea.</v>

395
00:15:53.002 --> 00:15:56.752
And as we arrived, it started to rain torrentially.

396
00:15:56.752 --> 00:15:59.304
Now, in Hawaii, this is a very propitious sign,

397
00:15:59.964 --> 00:16:01.243
because it's known,

398
00:16:01.494 --> 00:16:03.081
that when the Gods come,

399
00:16:03.081 --> 00:16:05.636
they always come with clouds and rain.

400
00:16:06.009 --> 00:16:08.937
And on this occasion, the clouds came down to the earth,

401
00:16:08.937 --> 00:16:11.361
and rained torrentially, for about 15 minutes,

402
00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:11.739
(snaps fingers)

403
00:16:11.739 --> 00:16:12.917
then stopped.

404
00:16:13.207 --> 00:16:14.252
Good sign.

405
00:16:14.492 --> 00:16:15.258
<v Regina>(mumbles)</v>

406
00:16:15.258 --> 00:16:16.729
<v ->On this occasion, about 15 people</v>

407
00:16:16.729 --> 00:16:18.132
came to hear what I had to say.

408
00:16:18.752 --> 00:16:21.109
And I was talking about the transformational community.

409
00:16:21.109 --> 00:16:23.469
I was talking about this very interesting slice

410
00:16:24.019 --> 00:16:25.428
of Western society,

411
00:16:25.763 --> 00:16:27.266
who are involved in the kinds of work

412
00:16:27.266 --> 00:16:29.378
that we're doing together today, alright?

413
00:16:29.378 --> 00:16:32.064
People who are interested in what we're exploring.

414
00:16:33.274 --> 00:16:35.652
Just before I began my talk, the door opened.

415
00:16:36.092 --> 00:16:38.835
And in comes this big Hawaiian man.

416
00:16:39.003 --> 00:16:40.791
Now this man's about a head taller than me.

417
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:42.471
He's got a big ponytail down his back,

418
00:16:42.471 --> 00:16:44.767
a great big white beard down his front,

419
00:16:44.767 --> 00:16:47.103
a big walking stick in front of him.

420
00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:50.238
And he had four more Hawaiian men with him,

421
00:16:50.238 --> 00:16:52.265
all of whom had beards and ponytails,

422
00:16:52.495 --> 00:16:54.447
and I'm going, "uhhhhhhhhh."

423
00:16:54.447 --> 00:16:55.959
<v Regina>(laughs) You'd better be for real.</v>

424
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:58.606
<v ->I knew that the time had come.</v>

425
00:16:58.606 --> 00:16:59.216
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

426
00:16:59.216 --> 00:17:00.812
<v ->That they had come to look me over.</v>

427
00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:03.356
Now these guys also had their wives with them.

428
00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:04.388
This was a good sign.

429
00:17:04.388 --> 00:17:06.812
This meant I wasn't gonna be turned into a pillar of salt,

430
00:17:06.812 --> 00:17:08.084
at least not that day.

431
00:17:09.254 --> 00:17:11.219
So, this man was introduced to me.

432
00:17:11.219 --> 00:17:12.767
He has since passed over,

433
00:17:12.767 --> 00:17:14.277
so I can use his name.

434
00:17:14.555 --> 00:17:16.187
His name was Hale Makua.

435
00:17:16.187 --> 00:17:18.921
Hale Kaohalani Makua.

436
00:17:18.921 --> 00:17:23.259
Seven generation direct descendant of King Kamehameha Nui,

437
00:17:23.969 --> 00:17:25.339
on his mother's side.

438
00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:27.267
And seven generation direct descendant

439
00:17:27.267 --> 00:17:29.031
of High Chief Kīwalaʻō,

440
00:17:29.265 --> 00:17:31.007
who was Kamehameha's cousin,

441
00:17:31.007 --> 00:17:32.437
who Kamehameha killed,

442
00:17:32.437 --> 00:17:34.717
to become the Moi, the King.

443
00:17:35.959 --> 00:17:38.053
In other words, this man Makua,

444
00:17:38.053 --> 00:17:40.107
had an exceptional genealogy.

445
00:17:40.121 --> 00:17:40.671
<v Regina>Right.</v>

446
00:17:40.671 --> 00:17:42.973
<v ->I'd been hearing about this guy for years.</v>

447
00:17:43.233 --> 00:17:45.433
This wasn't just any Kahuna who came to hear

448
00:17:45.433 --> 00:17:46.629
what I had to say.

449
00:17:46.886 --> 00:17:48.535
This was the Big Kahuna.

450
00:17:48.535 --> 00:17:49.635
<v Regina>The big Kahuna. (laughs)</v>

451
00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:51.257
<v ->This was the Big Kahuna.</v>

452
00:17:51.257 --> 00:17:53.039
This is a good time to have spirit helpers.

453
00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:55.877
So I breathed a quiet prayer to myself,

454
00:17:55.877 --> 00:17:57.735
asking for support.

455
00:17:57.735 --> 00:17:58.957
Launched into my talk.

456
00:18:00.007 --> 00:18:01.471
And about an hour and a half later,

457
00:18:01.471 --> 00:18:02.813
I came to the end,

458
00:18:02.813 --> 00:18:05.057
and I'm watching Makua all of this time.

459
00:18:05.057 --> 00:18:06.553
He's listening very seriously to what--

460
00:18:06.553 --> 00:18:07.609
everything I'm saying.

461
00:18:08.479 --> 00:18:10.189
When I came to the end of my talk,

462
00:18:11.449 --> 00:18:14.163
I had this feeling that he wanted to say something.

463
00:18:14.753 --> 00:18:16.481
It was an intuitive hit.

464
00:18:17.191 --> 00:18:19.778
And so I asked him, "Makua, I'm having this feeling

465
00:18:19.778 --> 00:18:21.502
"that there's something you would like to say."

466
00:18:22.638 --> 00:18:25.762
Makua, you know, sort of looked down and smiled, and--

467
00:18:26.232 --> 00:18:28.666
Now, this was a man who traveled with 27 generations

468
00:18:28.666 --> 00:18:32.340
of his ancestral spirits in constant attendance upon him.

469
00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.012
He kind of leaned over this way,

470
00:18:35.012 --> 00:18:37.514
as though someone was talking in that ear.

471
00:18:37.514 --> 00:18:39.346
Then he kind of leaned over this way,

472
00:18:39.346 --> 00:18:41.092
as though someone were talking in this ear.

473
00:18:41.744 --> 00:18:43.952
And he smiled, and he stood up.

474
00:18:45.024 --> 00:18:46.806
And he looked at me, and he said,

475
00:18:47.756 --> 00:18:49.424
"A friend of mine sent me your book.

476
00:18:50.744 --> 00:18:51.740
"And I read it.

477
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:55.934
<v Regina>That's it.</v>

478
00:18:56.494 --> 00:18:57.082
<v ->Silence--</v>

479
00:18:57.082 --> 00:18:57.510
(Regina laughs)

480
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.508
in the room.

481
00:18:58.508 --> 00:19:01.316
I mean, this was high noon in Polynesia, you know, this wa--

482
00:19:01.316 --> 00:19:02.724
<v Regina>You're waiting for the rest of the story.</v>

483
00:19:02.724 --> 00:19:04.804
<v ->Oh, my God, they're waiting for the other shoe to drop.</v>

484
00:19:05.244 --> 00:19:07.110
He looked at me very seriously, and he said,

485
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.432
"I read it again, just to make sure I got it right.

486
00:19:10.254 --> 00:19:11.752
"And then I went down to the ocean.

487
00:19:11.822 --> 00:19:12.590
"I went down to the beach,

488
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.728
"and I took your book, and I put it down on the sand."

489
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:15.784
This is in Spiritwalker.

490
00:19:17.454 --> 00:19:18.946
"And I called on the ancestors."

491
00:19:19.766 --> 00:19:21.534
He said, "I called on the ancestors,

492
00:19:21.534 --> 00:19:23.222
"and we had a talk about you."

493
00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.164
He looked at me seriously, and he said,

494
00:19:26.164 --> 00:19:28.530
"The ancestors asked me what your name is,

495
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.484
"and I told them your name is Wesselman.

496
00:19:30.484 --> 00:19:31.732
"Hank Wesselman."

497
00:19:32.742 --> 00:19:34.716
And he smiled at this point.

498
00:19:35.259 --> 00:19:38.279
Now, I'm gonna say something from a place of sharing,

499
00:19:38.279 --> 00:19:39.545
not from a place of ego.

500
00:19:39.801 --> 00:19:41.033
He looked at me and he said,

501
00:19:41.033 --> 00:19:42.155
"The ancestors told me

502
00:19:42.155 --> 00:19:43.699
"I wasn't pronouncing your name right.

503
00:19:44.025 --> 00:19:47.153
"They told me your name is Vessel-man."

504
00:19:47.303 --> 00:19:48.734
<v Regina>Vesselman, ah.</v>

505
00:19:48.734 --> 00:19:49.767
<v Hank>That you are the vessel--</v>
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

506
00:19:49.767 --> 00:19:50.801
<v ->Like the canoe.</v>

507
00:19:50.801 --> 00:19:53.199
And he's looking at me, to see if I'm getting it yet.

508
00:19:53.199 --> 00:19:55.091
And of course, I'm going into shock,

509
00:19:55.091 --> 00:19:57.263
because I'd been expecting him to condemn me.

510
00:19:57.263 --> 00:19:57.819
<v Regina>Right.</v>

511
00:19:57.819 --> 00:19:59.623
<v ->I'd been expecting him to say,</v>

512
00:19:59.623 --> 00:20:00.701
"Look, you're not Hawaiian.

513
00:20:00.701 --> 00:20:01.669
"Stop writing about us."

514
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:03.209
<v Regina>(laughs) You'd been dreading the day</v>

515
00:20:03.209 --> 00:20:04.705
the Kahunas would find you.

516
00:20:04.705 --> 00:20:06.399
<v ->Well, you know, there are all these well-intentioned</v>

517
00:20:06.399 --> 00:20:08.489
outsiders who've written books on Huna.

518
00:20:08.489 --> 00:20:09.083
<v Regina>Right.</v>

519
00:20:09.083 --> 00:20:10.189
<v ->Now, for starters,</v>

520
00:20:10.725 --> 00:20:13.879
Huna is not the word for the Hawaiian spiritual tradition.

521
00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:15.705
So whenever you read a book on Huna,

522
00:20:15.705 --> 00:20:17.443
it's written by an outsider,

523
00:20:17.779 --> 00:20:19.247
who doesn't know the deep knowledge.

524
00:20:20.477 --> 00:20:22.605
This man is watching me, as all these thoughts

525
00:20:22.605 --> 00:20:24.607
are going through my mind, right?

526
00:20:25.487 --> 00:20:26.676
And he says, "Don't worry.

527
00:20:26.676 --> 00:20:28.920
"We Hawaiians don't write. We talk.

528
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.785
"And we share what we find in our hearts with eachother.

529
00:20:32.505 --> 00:20:36.183
"But in your tradition, it's in your culture to write.

530
00:20:36.503 --> 00:20:39.538
"And so the ancestors have asked me to say to you, today,

531
00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:41.496
"in front of all these people here,

532
00:20:41.496 --> 00:20:44.136
"that everything you wrote in your book is true.

533
00:20:44.136 --> 00:20:46.182
"And we Hawaiians support you.

534
00:20:46.182 --> 00:20:47.634
"Keep spreading the word.

535
00:20:47.634 --> 00:20:48.844
"You're making my job easy."

536
00:20:48.844 --> 00:20:49.834
(Regina laughs softly)

537
00:20:49.834 --> 00:20:52.034
Now this was the beginning of a most unusual friendship.

538
00:20:52.744 --> 00:20:55.943
Makua walked over to me, laughing-- everybody was crying,

539
00:20:55.943 --> 00:20:58.033
because this was such a moving experience.

540
00:20:58.733 --> 00:21:00.182
He walked over to me and said,

541
00:21:00.522 --> 00:21:02.625
"We should have a meeting before you leave the island."

542
00:21:04.215 --> 00:21:05.295
We had our meeting.

543
00:21:05.837 --> 00:21:08.433
He and his partner Nina, me and my wife Jill.

544
00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:11.909
We met right on the edge of the Kilauea crater.

545
00:21:12.499 --> 00:21:16.423
That big active volcano on Mauna Loa's Southeastern side.

546
00:21:16.996 --> 00:21:19.752
We spent a whole day together, getting to know eachother.

547
00:21:20.472 --> 00:21:23.493
And at the end of that day, he gave me a gift.

548
00:21:24.233 --> 00:21:27.607
He gave me a bowl, a Hawaiian wooden bowl.

549
00:21:28.655 --> 00:21:29.832
And he said to me,

550
00:21:30.252 --> 00:21:32.437
"When each one of us comes into the world,

551
00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:35.033
"we came in with a bowl of light.

552
00:21:36.015 --> 00:21:39.477
"This is the light that's the gift from our oversoul,

553
00:21:40.041 --> 00:21:41.239
"our higher self,

554
00:21:41.239 --> 00:21:43.891
"which divided itself, before we came in,

555
00:21:43.891 --> 00:21:46.011
"and sent in a seed of its light."

556
00:21:46.619 --> 00:21:49.303
He said, "That bowl of light nourishes us and sustains us

557
00:21:49.303 --> 00:21:50.807
"as we pass through life.

558
00:21:51.459 --> 00:21:53.989
"But every time we step into the negative polarity,

559
00:21:54.729 --> 00:21:57.521
"every time we injure someone with our thoughts,

560
00:21:57.521 --> 00:21:59.277
"or our words, or our deeds.

561
00:21:59.555 --> 00:22:02.070
"every time we take something that doesn't belong to us,

562
00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.878
"every time we achieve success at the expense of

563
00:22:04.878 --> 00:22:06.492
"somebody else's failure,

564
00:22:07.232 --> 00:22:08.926
"it's like you put a stone in your bowl,

565
00:22:08.926 --> 00:22:10.474
"and some of your light goes out."

566
00:22:11.324 --> 00:22:12.534
He said, "Life is long,

567
00:22:12.534 --> 00:22:15.394
"and surely, surely, our bowl of light

568
00:22:15.394 --> 00:22:17.184
"begins to fill up with stones,

569
00:22:17.682 --> 00:22:19.802
"until there's almost no light coming out anymore."

570
00:22:20.586 --> 00:22:21.958
He said, "You know what you do then?"

571
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.244
And of course, my wife and I are hanging on every word.

572
00:22:25.244 --> 00:22:26.094
I said, "What?"

573
00:22:26.094 --> 00:22:27.076
He said, "That's easy."

574
00:22:27.076 --> 00:22:28.924
And he picked up the wooden bowl, and he turned it over,

575
00:22:28.924 --> 00:22:30.112
and he said, "You just dump them--

576
00:22:30.112 --> 00:22:31.124
<v Regina>Dumped out all the rocks. (laughs)</v>

577
00:22:31.124 --> 00:22:32.606
<v ->Dumped out all the rocks.</v>

578
00:22:32.884 --> 00:22:34.034
And he laughed.

579
00:22:34.034 --> 00:22:36.132
He said, "But when you reach that point,

580
00:22:37.482 --> 00:22:39.998
"that's when you become a spiritual warrior."

581
00:22:40.634 --> 00:22:42.892
Now, he used this word "warrior" with deliberation,

582
00:22:43.212 --> 00:22:45.142
because Makua was in the Marine Corp,

583
00:22:45.142 --> 00:22:47.782
and he was a warrior, right?

584
00:22:47.782 --> 00:22:49.674
90 tours of duty in Vietnam.

585
00:22:49.674 --> 00:22:50.268
<v Regina>Mmm.</v>

586
00:22:50.268 --> 00:22:52.138
<v ->Five wars, starting with Beirut.</v>

587
00:22:52.138 --> 00:22:52.919
<v Regina>Mmm.</v>

588
00:22:52.919 --> 00:22:54.129
<v ->He was a warrior.</v>

589
00:22:55.489 --> 00:22:58.025
He said, "When you become a spiritual warrior,

590
00:22:58.025 --> 00:22:59.255
"your path is narrow.

591
00:22:59.468 --> 00:23:03.592
"And it's constrained by three sacred directives."

592
00:23:04.462 --> 00:23:05.616
<v Hank>They call them kapus--</v>
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

593
00:23:05.616 --> 00:23:07.014
<v Hank>in Hawaiian.</v>
<v Regina>Right.</v>

594
00:23:07.014 --> 00:23:08.584
<v ->Three sacred kapus.</v>

595
00:23:08.584 --> 00:23:10.028
He said, "The first kapu.

596
00:23:11.478 --> 00:23:14.074
"Love all that you see,

597
00:23:15.254 --> 00:23:16.516
"with humility."

598
00:23:18.466 --> 00:23:20.041
Love what you see.

599
00:23:20.666 --> 00:23:22.250
Get in touch with your aloha,

600
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:25.321
and extend that aloha to all that you see,

601
00:23:25.954 --> 00:23:27.868
cause that's where you find your humility.

602
00:23:28.191 --> 00:23:29.981
That can only be done through humility.

603
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:32.863
He said, "I've worked on that one for seven years."

604
00:23:34.615 --> 00:23:35.789
"Number two.

605
00:23:36.485 --> 00:23:41.025
"Live all that you feel, with reverance."

606
00:23:42.315 --> 00:23:44.083
Live what you feel with reverance.

607
00:23:44.229 --> 00:23:46.407
This reverance, this act of respect,

608
00:23:46.407 --> 00:23:48.879
this is where indigenous mind begins.

609
00:23:49.267 --> 00:23:50.653
You see, Western mind,

610
00:23:51.743 --> 00:23:53.997
Western mind begins with dominion.

611
00:23:54.507 --> 00:23:55.840
Control.

612
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:58.986
Indigenous mind begins with respect.

613
00:23:59.704 --> 00:24:00.702
With reverance.

614
00:24:02.416 --> 00:24:04.558
He said, "I've worked on that one for seven years."

615
00:24:05.342 --> 00:24:07.066
Then finally, "Number three.

616
00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:12.696
"Know all that you possess, with discipline."

617
00:24:14.516 --> 00:24:16.716
Cause this is where you find your self discipline.

618
00:24:16.716 --> 00:24:19.114
If you're gonna walk the spiritual path,

619
00:24:19.734 --> 00:24:22.152
you have to come from a place of self discipline.

620
00:24:22.152 --> 00:24:24.140
Otherwise, nothing works right.

621
00:24:25.012 --> 00:24:27.606
So, he laid these three directives on me.

622
00:24:27.986 --> 00:24:31.018
And you know, I'm thinking, "Wow, this is really something."

623
00:24:31.018 --> 00:24:32.668
This was the beginning of our friendship,

624
00:24:32.668 --> 00:24:36.100
and over an eight year period, until he passed in 2004,

625
00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.102
whenever my wife and I went to Hawaii,

626
00:24:38.102 --> 00:24:40.280
we would spend anywhere from a day to

627
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.052
two or three, four days with him and his partner Nina.

628
00:24:43.472 --> 00:24:46.504
And during this time, he shared with me

629
00:24:46.504 --> 00:24:48.762
an enormous amount of knowledge,

630
00:24:48.762 --> 00:24:50.478
from the Kahuna tradition,

631
00:24:50.478 --> 00:24:52.402
none of which has been published, and of course,

632
00:24:53.482 --> 00:24:55.219
I don't know if any of it ever will be.

633
00:24:55.219 --> 00:24:56.947
But in the workshops and seminars,

634
00:24:57.937 --> 00:25:00.229
very often we get into discussions.

635
00:25:00.573 --> 00:25:03.113
So it becomes shared in the oral tradition.

636
00:25:03.113 --> 00:25:03.653
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

637
00:25:03.653 --> 00:25:05.197
<v ->Which is the way that it always was.</v>

638
00:25:05.197 --> 00:25:05.893
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

639
00:25:05.893 --> 00:25:07.105
<v ->You know, when we teach at Esalen,</v>

640
00:25:07.105 --> 00:25:08.139
when we teach at Omega,

641
00:25:08.139 --> 00:25:09.415
when we teach at Crossings,

642
00:25:09.415 --> 00:25:11.373
when we teach in Hawaii, you know.

643
00:25:11.373 --> 00:25:14.651
All of these seminar and workshop centers

644
00:25:14.651 --> 00:25:18.611
allow us to come and share what we have to offer.

645
00:25:20.261 --> 00:25:22.256
Now, you wanted to talk about the soul.

646
00:25:22.256 --> 00:25:24.558
<v Regina>Yes, and in the Kahuna tradition,</v>

647
00:25:24.558 --> 00:25:26.492
and in what you have learned,

648
00:25:26.492 --> 00:25:30.138
again, without revealing anything that should be--

649
00:25:30.138 --> 00:25:31.590
should not be passed on,

650
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:37.009
the Kahuna tradition has particular understanding

651
00:25:37.009 --> 00:25:39.613
of the soul, its parts and its functions.

652
00:25:40.089 --> 00:25:43.037
And so, I wanted you to talk about that a little bit,

653
00:25:43.037 --> 00:25:43.609
if you will.

654
00:25:43.609 --> 00:25:44.973
<v ->Well, it was through my experiences,</v>

655
00:25:44.973 --> 00:25:46.535
which are recorded in the Vision--

656
00:25:46.535 --> 00:25:48.554
in the Spiritwalker trilogy,

657
00:25:49.273 --> 00:25:52.220
that I learned that the Hawaiians understand

658
00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.574
that we have, not one, but three souls.

659
00:25:55.724 --> 00:25:57.993
I also discovered that the Inuit

660
00:25:58.473 --> 00:25:59.951
believe we have three souls.

661
00:25:59.951 --> 00:26:00.611
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

662
00:26:00.611 --> 00:26:02.569
The Lakota, three souls.

663
00:26:02.569 --> 00:26:04.535
The Cherokee, three souls.

664
00:26:04.535 --> 00:26:07.757
The Orisha tradition of Africa, three souls.

665
00:26:07.757 --> 00:26:10.682
The Shuar of the Amazon, three souls.

666
00:26:11.471 --> 00:26:12.615
Now this is quite interesting.

667
00:26:12.615 --> 00:26:17.081
I have no idea how widely this knowledge was once held,

668
00:26:17.081 --> 00:26:19.985
in the indigenous world, because so much has been lost,

669
00:26:19.985 --> 00:26:21.819
through Christian missionary activity.

670
00:26:22.812 --> 00:26:24.550
But if I were to summarize the way in which

671
00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:27.048
the Kahunas view the three souls,

672
00:26:27.048 --> 00:26:28.598
we could begin with the higher self,

673
00:26:28.598 --> 00:26:29.838
the oversoul.

674
00:26:30.006 --> 00:26:31.862
The immortal, spiritual soul.

675
00:26:32.756 --> 00:26:35.176
Which is who we are there, right?

676
00:26:35.176 --> 00:26:38.973
That soul exists always, eternally, in the upper worlds.

677
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.984
In what Judeo Christians call "Heaven".

678
00:26:41.984 --> 00:26:43.775
And Islamic people call "Paradise".

679
00:26:43.775 --> 00:26:45.689
That aspect of our self resides there.

680
00:26:45.689 --> 00:26:46.393
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

681
00:26:46.753 --> 00:26:48.498
Now before we come into life,

682
00:26:48.758 --> 00:26:50.771
the oversoul divides itself,

683
00:26:50.771 --> 00:26:53.747
and it sends down a seed of its energy.

684
00:26:53.957 --> 00:26:55.771
This is very much like a hologram,

685
00:26:55.771 --> 00:26:58.908
in the sense that that seed contains everything,

686
00:26:58.908 --> 00:27:01.262
which is recorded in the oversoul field.

687
00:27:02.742 --> 00:27:05.713
Interestingly, the vehicle of transfer

688
00:27:05.713 --> 00:27:08.573
to the new embodiment for a new life,

689
00:27:09.482 --> 00:27:10.597
is the breath.

690
00:27:11.557 --> 00:27:13.669
What the Hawaiians call the "Ha".

691
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:14.439
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

692
00:27:14.439 --> 00:27:15.319
<v ->Ha.</v>

693
00:27:15.319 --> 00:27:17.387
Ha, as in, aloha.

694
00:27:17.777 --> 00:27:19.786
Alo means face to face.

695
00:27:19.786 --> 00:27:22.421
Ha is the divine breath of life.

696
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.027
And when I say aloha to you, it means,

697
00:27:25.217 --> 00:27:27.011
"The God in me greets the Goddess in you."

698
00:27:27.491 --> 00:27:28.391
Alright?

699
00:27:28.933 --> 00:27:31.269
Now, the vehicle of transfer, the breath.

700
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:35.497
When the embodiment is being born from its mother's womb,

701
00:27:35.497 --> 00:27:37.293
and it takes its first breath,

702
00:27:37.293 --> 00:27:38.437
(breathes in deeply)

703
00:27:38.977 --> 00:27:42.639
that seed of light descends and takes up residence.

704
00:27:43.062 --> 00:27:43.774
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

705
00:27:44.214 --> 00:27:47.840
Now, as this seed of light comes into the new being,

706
00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:48.896
for the new life,

707
00:27:48.896 --> 00:27:51.731
it encounters a distinct and separate soul,

708
00:27:51.731 --> 00:27:53.249
which is already in residence.

709
00:27:53.709 --> 00:27:56.684
This is the soul of the body, the body soul,

710
00:27:56.684 --> 00:27:59.090
what Hawaiians call "unihipili".

711
00:27:59.478 --> 00:28:01.378
There are lots of fancy words for these

712
00:28:01.378 --> 00:28:02.646
different aspects of the self.

713
00:28:02.646 --> 00:28:04.450
We'll just use the term body soul.

714
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.184
Now, the body soul find its source

715
00:28:07.504 --> 00:28:10.173
from mom and dad.

716
00:28:10.781 --> 00:28:13.487
Because in the same way that there's a genetic template,

717
00:28:13.487 --> 00:28:16.061
that accompanies the sperm and the egg,

718
00:28:16.061 --> 00:28:20.008
there's also a psychic, spiritual, energetic template,

719
00:28:20.008 --> 00:28:22.529
that accompanies the sperm and the egg.

720
00:28:22.529 --> 00:28:26.775
And that spiritual complex merges at fertilization,

721
00:28:26.775 --> 00:28:28.229
to form a unity.

722
00:28:28.733 --> 00:28:31.439
And its within that body soul,

723
00:28:31.439 --> 00:28:34.497
within that energetic, spiritual component,

724
00:28:35.237 --> 00:28:38.407
that the embryo grows into a fetus which eventually

725
00:28:38.407 --> 00:28:40.057
takes form as the individual

726
00:28:40.057 --> 00:28:41.979
who's ready to be born into life.

727
00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:46.570
Now, this body soul contains all ancestral imprints,

728
00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:48.910
from both the mother's and father's lineages.

729
00:28:49.038 --> 00:28:51.168
This is why we do things which are reminiscent of

730
00:28:51.168 --> 00:28:53.268
this ancestor or that ancestor.

731
00:28:53.268 --> 00:28:54.562
<v Regina>Not just genetically,</v>

732
00:28:54.562 --> 00:28:56.784
but also socially and learned behaviors.

733
00:28:56.784 --> 00:28:57.708
<v Hank>Patterns of behavior--</v>

734
00:28:57.708 --> 00:28:58.412
<v Regina>Patterns of behavior, yes.</v>

735
00:28:58.412 --> 00:28:59.380
<v ->Patterns of expression.</v>

736
00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.634
Patterns of character.

737
00:29:00.634 --> 00:29:01.316
<v Regina>Right.</v>

738
00:29:01.316 --> 00:29:01.764
<v ->Right?</v>

739
00:29:01.764 --> 00:29:02.774
<v Regina>Belief systems.</v>

740
00:29:02.774 --> 00:29:03.936
<v ->That's right.</v>

741
00:29:04.226 --> 00:29:06.621
Now, the body soul has very specific functions.

742
00:29:06.767 --> 00:29:08.483
If I were to just list them on my fingers.

743
00:29:08.733 --> 00:29:11.761
Number one, this is where your memory banks are stored.

744
00:29:12.261 --> 00:29:13.721
This is where your memories are.

745
00:29:14.481 --> 00:29:17.085
Number two, it's the source of all of our

746
00:29:17.085 --> 00:29:18.625
emotions and feelings,

747
00:29:18.625 --> 00:29:21.387
which is why Deepak and others call it the emotional body.

748
00:29:21.991 --> 00:29:23.069
Number three.

749
00:29:23.489 --> 00:29:28.245
It's the aspect of ourselves, which perceives the other.

750
00:29:28.245 --> 00:29:29.409
The other world out there,

751
00:29:29.409 --> 00:29:31.759
as well as the other in there.

752
00:29:31.759 --> 00:29:33.993
It's the interface between the self and the other,

753
00:29:33.993 --> 00:29:34.957
the perceiver.

754
00:29:36.057 --> 00:29:39.441
Number four, the entire operation of the physical body,

755
00:29:39.441 --> 00:29:41.751
including its repair and restoration,

756
00:29:41.751 --> 00:29:43.335
is under its direct control.

757
00:29:43.335 --> 00:29:46.283
That means, the inner healer, is in the body soul.

758
00:29:46.283 --> 00:29:48.154
The body soul is programmed to do this.

759
00:29:48.964 --> 00:29:52.115
Number five, all of our habitual and learned behavior

760
00:29:52.115 --> 00:29:53.875
emerges from the body soul,

761
00:29:53.875 --> 00:29:55.723
because the body soul function is memory.

762
00:29:56.493 --> 00:29:59.518
Number six, it's programmed to grow,

763
00:29:59.518 --> 00:30:01.767
to increase and become more.

764
00:30:01.767 --> 00:30:04.482
It's not programmed to repress, deny and contain.

765
00:30:04.482 --> 00:30:05.230
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

766
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.256
<v ->Alright? Which is why we get into so much trouble--</v>

767
00:30:07.256 --> 00:30:07.718
<v Regina>Right.</v>

768
00:30:07.718 --> 00:30:11.222
<v ->when we repress, deny, or hold negative memories,</v>

769
00:30:11.222 --> 00:30:13.514
negative emotions, negative thoughts within us.

770
00:30:13.514 --> 00:30:14.362
<v Regina>Disease is the result--</v>

771
00:30:14.362 --> 00:30:15.506
<v Hank>It disrupts--</v>
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

772
00:30:15.506 --> 00:30:16.246
<v ->the pattern.</v>

773
00:30:16.246 --> 00:30:18.010
The matrix of our energetic field,

774
00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:19.804
which is a precursor to illness.

775
00:30:19.804 --> 00:30:20.390
<v Regina>Right.</v>

776
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.579
<v ->Finally, the body soul is very much like</v>

777
00:30:25.579 --> 00:30:29.107
a good servant, a faithful servant, or a good computer.

778
00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:31.321
In fact, your body soul is kind of like

779
00:30:31.321 --> 00:30:32.715
your inner hard drive,

780
00:30:33.521 --> 00:30:34.929
in the sense that it's programmed

781
00:30:34.929 --> 00:30:36.689
with all the evolutionary software,

782
00:30:36.999 --> 00:30:40.300
that this embodiment needs to get through life successfully.

783
00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:42.272
The acquiring of new skills,

784
00:30:42.272 --> 00:30:43.834
the acquiring of new abilities,

785
00:30:43.834 --> 00:30:46.518
learning new things, that's all programmed in

786
00:30:46.518 --> 00:30:47.868
through the body soul.

787
00:30:48.881 --> 00:30:51.226
The body soul is very impressed by anything physical.

788
00:30:51.519 --> 00:30:53.220
Ritual, ceremony.

789
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.157
Basketball games, football games,

790
00:30:56.157 --> 00:30:58.071
this is all impressive to the body soul.

791
00:30:58.071 --> 00:31:00.473
<v Regina>And anything of a sensorial nature, right?</v>

792
00:31:00.713 --> 00:31:02.139
<v Hank>Love making.</v>
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

793
00:31:02.479 --> 00:31:06.644
<v ->You see, the body soul is the sender and receiver</v>

794
00:31:06.644 --> 00:31:11.044
of all psychic and Shamanic experiences, which is why

795
00:31:11.044 --> 00:31:13.776
it was on the heels of a joyous marital encounter,

796
00:31:13.776 --> 00:31:16.632
that I began to go into these visionary experiences.

797
00:31:16.907 --> 00:31:18.780
See, sexuality is one of the gateways

798
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.496
to transcendent experiences.

799
00:31:20.496 --> 00:31:24.784
It's probably the most easily accessible one to us,

800
00:31:24.784 --> 00:31:26.546
and one of the most pleasurable.

801
00:31:27.006 --> 00:31:29.475
That's cause the body soul is motivated by pleasure.

802
00:31:29.962 --> 00:31:34.662
See, the oversoul is motivated by creation.

803
00:31:35.534 --> 00:31:39.450
The oversoul is the creator of who and what we are.

804
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:43.119
It's our personal creator, our God self.

805
00:31:44.196 --> 00:31:46.901
And the body soul is kind of like the servant.

806
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:51.953
Now, between the body soul and the oversoul seed,

807
00:31:51.953 --> 00:31:55.129
the third soul comes into being in response to life.

808
00:31:55.267 --> 00:31:56.581
This is the mental soul.

809
00:31:57.453 --> 00:31:59.045
What the Hawaiians call "uhane".

810
00:32:00.401 --> 00:32:03.071
The mental soul is what Freud called "ego",

811
00:32:03.493 --> 00:32:06.121
and what Jung called the conscious mind.

812
00:32:06.421 --> 00:32:09.223
In fact, the body-- the mental soul, right?

813
00:32:09.223 --> 00:32:11.819
The body soul is what we call subconscious--

814
00:32:11.819 --> 00:32:13.469
well, unconscious mind.

815
00:32:13.469 --> 00:32:13.975
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

816
00:32:13.975 --> 00:32:14.987
<v ->Or the "id" of Freud.</v>

817
00:32:14.987 --> 00:32:15.669
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

818
00:32:16.239 --> 00:32:19.487
The mental soul is the conscious mind, or the ego.

819
00:32:19.487 --> 00:32:22.424
And the mental soul, again, has very specific functions.

820
00:32:22.835 --> 00:32:24.207
It's our inner director.

821
00:32:25.263 --> 00:32:25.869
Alright?

822
00:32:25.869 --> 00:32:28.245
It's the aspect of our self that thinks,

823
00:32:28.245 --> 00:32:31.993
analyzes, integrates, and makes decisions.

824
00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.682
It's the aspect of our self that receives information

825
00:32:35.682 --> 00:32:37.464
from a variety of sources,

826
00:32:37.774 --> 00:32:39.292
through the body soul,

827
00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:41.820
analyzes that information, integrates it,

828
00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.283
and makes decisions about it.

829
00:32:43.283 --> 00:32:44.845
<v Regina>So, in essence, we would have there the--</v>

830
00:32:44.845 --> 00:32:46.561
what we would call the conscious mind--

831
00:32:46.561 --> 00:32:47.881
which I find ironic--

832
00:32:47.881 --> 00:32:49.685
the subconscious mind in the body,

833
00:32:49.685 --> 00:32:51.489
<v Regina>and the super-conscious mind--</v>
<v Hank>That's it.</v>

834
00:32:51.489 --> 00:32:52.479
<v Regina>in the spirit.</v>

835
00:32:52.479 --> 00:32:53.381
<v ->That's it.</v>

836
00:32:53.381 --> 00:32:55.185
<v Regina>Even though the conscious mind is probably</v>

837
00:32:55.185 --> 00:32:57.531
the most limited in scope, in a way,

838
00:32:57.531 --> 00:32:58.617
but it is at the helm.

839
00:32:58.617 --> 00:32:59.827
<v Hank>That's it.</v>
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

840
00:32:59.827 --> 00:33:02.093
<v ->In many ways, the so-called unconscious or subconscious</v>

841
00:33:02.093 --> 00:33:03.965
is much more conscious than the conscious mind.

842
00:33:03.965 --> 00:33:04.689
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

843
00:33:04.689 --> 00:33:06.251
<v ->Cause it's multi-tracking, all the time.</v>

844
00:33:06.251 --> 00:33:06.845
<v Regina>Right.</v>

845
00:33:06.845 --> 00:33:07.923
<v ->It's aware of all sorts of things,</v>

846
00:33:07.923 --> 00:33:09.375
that we're not consciously aware of.

847
00:33:10.995 --> 00:33:14.156
Now, the conscious mind is also the source of our volition,

848
00:33:14.491 --> 00:33:16.158
and our intentionality,

849
00:33:16.504 --> 00:33:18.834
which means, it's your inner CEO.

850
00:33:18.834 --> 00:33:19.692
Your inner Chief.

851
00:33:19.692 --> 00:33:20.888
Your inner director.

852
00:33:21.474 --> 00:33:24.931
And the decisions that it makes, in full awareness or not,

853
00:33:24.931 --> 00:33:26.733
are what steer it successfully,

854
00:33:27.065 --> 00:33:29.053
or unsuccessfully, through life.

855
00:33:29.475 --> 00:33:31.301
Cause we're here to learn lessons.

856
00:33:31.301 --> 00:33:32.775
It's all about learning our lessons,

857
00:33:32.775 --> 00:33:34.579
and becoming more than we were.

858
00:33:34.579 --> 00:33:35.679
<v Regina>And yet, at the same time,</v>

859
00:33:35.679 --> 00:33:38.519
it's somewhat of a slave to the subconscious mind.

860
00:33:39.249 --> 00:33:41.530
<v ->It's in relationship with the subconscious mind.</v>

861
00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:42.340
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

862
00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:43.933
<v ->See, the three souls,</v>

863
00:33:43.933 --> 00:33:46.881
oversoul, body soul and mental soul,

864
00:33:46.881 --> 00:33:48.335
are in relationship.

865
00:33:48.335 --> 00:33:49.015
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

866
00:33:49.015 --> 00:33:51.409
<v ->And when those three souls are aligned,</v>

867
00:33:51.409 --> 00:33:54.328
fully expressed, fully aware, fully

868
00:33:55.545 --> 00:33:57.379
disciplined, could we say?

869
00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:01.726
This is the stage, which the Buddha called "enlightenment".

870
00:34:01.726 --> 00:34:02.312
<v Regina>Right.</v>

871
00:34:02.752 --> 00:34:05.495
<v ->Because everything becomes possible at that point.</v>

872
00:34:05.495 --> 00:34:07.114
And the symbol of the Buddha,

873
00:34:07.114 --> 00:34:09.532
seated in deep meditation,

874
00:34:09.532 --> 00:34:11.426
fully awakened, fully aware,

875
00:34:11.936 --> 00:34:15.179
is the symbol which the Hawaiians call Kanaloa.

876
00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:17.753
Kanaloa is the God of the ocean.

877
00:34:17.753 --> 00:34:19.200
The God of the deep sea.

878
00:34:19.737 --> 00:34:23.372
And Kanaloa is the great sustainor and progenitor of life.

879
00:34:23.372 --> 00:34:26.223
In fact, in Polynesian mythology,

880
00:34:26.223 --> 00:34:29.105
Kanaloa is one of the star people, who came here,

881
00:34:29.105 --> 00:34:30.931
with his wife Mar-i-u-la,

882
00:34:30.931 --> 00:34:33.703
and found this place to be good,

883
00:34:33.703 --> 00:34:36.255
dove deep into the ocean, and then,

884
00:34:36.255 --> 00:34:38.389
the other princes of heaven went back

885
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:40.171
and brought all of the other souls here.

886
00:34:40.761 --> 00:34:43.003
It's a very beautiful creation story,

887
00:34:43.533 --> 00:34:45.878
in which we, literally, came as seeds of life,

888
00:34:45.878 --> 00:34:47.528
from across the universe.

889
00:34:47.528 --> 00:34:49.420
And we were brought here by high guardians,

890
00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.356
who knew our purpose and our destiny.

891
00:34:51.356 --> 00:34:52.676
<v Regina>And it's interesting because,</v>

892
00:34:52.676 --> 00:34:55.573
in different traditions, the same story is reflected,

893
00:34:55.962 --> 00:34:57.061
just different names.

894
00:34:57.061 --> 00:34:58.447
<v ->That's it, you see, and,</v>

895
00:34:58.447 --> 00:35:00.745
in Judeo Christianity, for example, it's agreed,

896
00:35:00.745 --> 00:35:02.987
that God breathes life into form.

897
00:35:03.261 --> 00:35:05.893
And the same word is used for spirit and breath.

898
00:35:05.893 --> 00:35:09.281
Spiritus, in latin, means both "spirit" and "breath".

899
00:35:09.281 --> 00:35:12.691
In Hebrew, ruach, ruach,

900
00:35:12.691 --> 00:35:15.507
is the word for breath and the word for spirit.

901
00:35:15.507 --> 00:35:16.255
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

902
00:35:16.255 --> 00:35:18.079
But you see, in the inner mystical tradition,

903
00:35:18.199 --> 00:35:20.766
it's not some monotheistic creator God

904
00:35:20.766 --> 00:35:23.098
that was invented by the organized priesthoods

905
00:35:23.098 --> 00:35:24.984
of our hierarchical religions.

906
00:35:24.984 --> 00:35:27.014
It's not this monotheistic creator God,

907
00:35:27.014 --> 00:35:28.510
who breathed life into us.

908
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:30.564
It's our own personal God self.

909
00:35:30.734 --> 00:35:31.534
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

910
00:35:31.534 --> 00:35:33.902
<v ->And the oversoul, right, the oversoul,</v>

911
00:35:34.472 --> 00:35:36.923
is-- it serves as the source,

912
00:35:36.923 --> 00:35:39.299
of who and what we are as we come into life.

913
00:35:39.779 --> 00:35:42.907
And at the end of life, when the physical embodiment dies,

914
00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:46.872
the soul cluster detaches with the last breath,

915
00:35:47.485 --> 00:35:49.419
when you release your last breath,

916
00:35:49.419 --> 00:35:52.707
and it returns to its source in the upper world.

917
00:35:52.707 --> 00:35:55.253
And so, everything that we have done and become,

918
00:35:55.253 --> 00:35:59.109
including our ability to make choices and to create,

919
00:35:59.109 --> 00:36:00.561
a function of the ego,

920
00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:03.275
is incorporated into the oversoul,

921
00:36:03.275 --> 00:36:06.872
which grows, increases, and becomes more, in response.

922
00:36:07.263 --> 00:36:09.407
<v Regina>So, a question here at this point then.</v>

923
00:36:09.976 --> 00:36:12.728
On the path to, as you say in the Buddha's tradition,

924
00:36:12.728 --> 00:36:14.356
what is called enlightenment,

925
00:36:14.356 --> 00:36:16.748
where the three parts of the being are in harmony

926
00:36:16.958 --> 00:36:18.800
and relationship to eachother,

927
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.382
were the three tenants that the Kahuna gave you,

928
00:36:22.382 --> 00:36:24.758
about loving all that's in front of you,

929
00:36:24.758 --> 00:36:26.432
with humility and so forth.

930
00:36:26.776 --> 00:36:30.518
Would you say that these are, in essence,

931
00:36:30.518 --> 00:36:33.840
pathways to that state of harmonizing?

932
00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.767
<v ->Yes I would.</v>

933
00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.687
Yes I would, and

934
00:36:36.687 --> 00:36:40.149
once you understand those three directives,

935
00:36:41.019 --> 00:36:43.105
our path becomes very narrow.

936
00:36:43.105 --> 00:36:43.415
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

937
00:36:43.415 --> 00:36:44.663
<v Hank>Cause it's contrained by--</v>
<v Regina>Very clear.</v>

938
00:36:44.663 --> 00:36:47.617
<v ->humility, by reverance, and by discipline.</v>

939
00:36:48.527 --> 00:36:52.467
And we function by offering aloha, love.

940
00:36:52.784 --> 00:36:55.033
We live-- this is what Joseph Campbell meant,

941
00:36:55.033 --> 00:36:57.642
when he said, "Follow your bliss, and you can't go wrong."

942
00:36:58.733 --> 00:36:59.988
And we have to know,

943
00:36:59.988 --> 00:37:03.754
we have to achieve self knowledge, self realization.

944
00:37:04.482 --> 00:37:07.130
And when we achieve that, when we know who we are,

945
00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:11.096
we experience authentic initiation.

946
00:37:11.745 --> 00:37:13.341
<v Regina>Because the obstacles, in essence,</v>

947
00:37:13.341 --> 00:37:14.518
have been removed.

948
00:37:15.233 --> 00:37:16.487
<v Hank>That's right.</v>
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

949
00:37:16.487 --> 00:37:17.719
<v ->It's not so much about memorizing</v>

950
00:37:17.719 --> 00:37:19.539
sacred texts or scriptures.

951
00:37:19.539 --> 00:37:22.031
It's more about the removal of obstacles.

952
00:37:22.031 --> 00:37:22.965
<v Regina>Right.</v>

953
00:37:22.975 --> 00:37:25.771
<v ->This is the spiritual path at its best.</v>

954
00:37:25.771 --> 00:37:28.895
And for me, the world of the Shaman just opened this up.

955
00:37:28.895 --> 00:37:31.777
Because the Shaman's world is about direct experience.

956
00:37:31.777 --> 00:37:33.581
Direct experience of spirit.

957
00:37:34.241 --> 00:37:36.510
You know, Ken Wilber has it-- you know,

958
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:40.234
many of your listeners and watchers, you know,

959
00:37:40.234 --> 00:37:41.532
are aware of Ken Wilber,

960
00:37:41.532 --> 00:37:44.583
as one of the greatest philosophical minds of our time.

961
00:37:44.583 --> 00:37:47.333
Getting through his really thick books is a slug.

962
00:37:47.983 --> 00:37:51.301
He said some-- he organized something in one of his books,

963
00:37:51.491 --> 00:37:52.873
I'm not sure which one it was,

964
00:37:52.873 --> 00:37:54.787
in which he outlined the various stages

965
00:37:54.787 --> 00:37:56.691
of spiritual unfolding.

966
00:37:56.877 --> 00:37:58.132
Had four stages.

967
00:37:58.277 --> 00:38:01.629
Number one, spiritual unfolding begins with belief.

968
00:38:02.519 --> 00:38:04.086
Now you can have mystical beliefs,

969
00:38:04.086 --> 00:38:05.230
you could have mythic beliefs,

970
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.440
you could have religious beliefs,

971
00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.694
you could have scientific beliefs,

972
00:38:07.694 --> 00:38:08.994
rational beliefs.

973
00:38:09.244 --> 00:38:11.508
Beliefs are great, as far as they go.

974
00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.634
But not much in your life is gonna change

975
00:38:13.634 --> 00:38:14.934
in response to them.

976
00:38:14.934 --> 00:38:15.556
You know, you can believe

977
00:38:15.556 --> 00:38:17.993
in the existence of spirits for 25 years,

978
00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.442
and not much changes.

979
00:38:19.442 --> 00:38:21.202
Your life just goes on as before.

980
00:38:21.742 --> 00:38:25.833
So, in the end, beliefs begin to flag, right?

981
00:38:25.833 --> 00:38:27.131
They begin to fail us.

982
00:38:27.131 --> 00:38:29.471
This is when the second stage steps in.

983
00:38:30.234 --> 00:38:31.099
Faith.

984
00:38:32.411 --> 00:38:36.137
Faith soldiers on, when beliefs no longer compel us.

985
00:38:36.261 --> 00:38:37.369
Have faith.

986
00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.001
Now, faith can take you in two different directions.

987
00:38:40.521 --> 00:38:44.594
In one direction, faith spirals you back into belief.

988
00:38:45.224 --> 00:38:48.767
This is fundamentalism, and in my humble opinion,

989
00:38:49.227 --> 00:38:50.065
it's a trap,

990
00:38:50.879 --> 00:38:54.055
because it will not take you into what you're looking for.

991
00:38:54.707 --> 00:38:56.577
When faith is doing its job, it takes you

992
00:38:56.577 --> 00:38:59.081
in the other direction, into the third stage,

993
00:38:59.081 --> 00:39:00.677
which is direct experience.

994
00:39:01.461 --> 00:39:04.029
And when you've had direct experience of spirit,

995
00:39:04.209 --> 00:39:07.269
It takes you immediately into the fourth and final stage,

996
00:39:07.269 --> 00:39:09.169
which is personal transformation.

997
00:39:09.489 --> 00:39:10.849
That's really the goal.

998
00:39:11.215 --> 00:39:13.385
And it happens, moment by moment.

999
00:39:13.385 --> 00:39:14.001
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1000
00:39:14.001 --> 00:39:15.937
<v ->It's not some great, all-embracing</v>

1001
00:39:15.937 --> 00:39:18.081
enlightenment Satori experience,

1002
00:39:18.081 --> 00:39:19.523
that you get sitting in the temple.

1003
00:39:19.523 --> 00:39:22.435
<v Regina>And it happens, decision by decision--</v>

1004
00:39:22.775 --> 00:39:23.459
<v ->Happens washing the dishes.</v>

1005
00:39:23.459 --> 00:39:24.671
<v Regina>Every encounter you have.</v>

1006
00:39:24.671 --> 00:39:25.441
<v ->Changing the diapers.</v>

1007
00:39:25.441 --> 00:39:26.497
<v Regina>Exactly, changing the diapers--</v>

1008
00:39:26.497 --> 00:39:27.069
<v ->Sure.</v>

1009
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.773
<v Regina>And how you perceive it.</v>

1010
00:39:27.773 --> 00:39:29.271
How you choose to perceive it.

1011
00:39:29.271 --> 00:39:32.591
And this transformation actually has physical manifestations

1012
00:39:32.591 --> 00:39:34.541
and this is the part I'd like to--

1013
00:39:34.541 --> 00:39:36.297
unless you want to continue on that path for a moment,

1014
00:39:36.297 --> 00:39:38.067
<v Hank>Let's go on.</v>
<v Regina>I'd like to go to this--</v>

1015
00:39:38.067 --> 00:39:41.021
I'd like to take the logical extension from here, which is,

1016
00:39:41.941 --> 00:39:45.243
some brave-- some brainwave work,

1017
00:39:45.243 --> 00:39:46.923
that you've had done on you,

1018
00:39:47.233 --> 00:39:49.029
and what the results were,

1019
00:39:49.029 --> 00:39:53.550
after all of these experiences and openings, unto yourself.

1020
00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.153
What happened with that?

1021
00:39:55.959 --> 00:39:58.505
<v ->Boy, this is where the scientist just sparkles.</v>

1022
00:39:58.745 --> 00:40:03.289
In 1996, something very unusual dropped into my lap.

1023
00:40:03.289 --> 00:40:05.441
I got a large manila envelope.

1024
00:40:05.991 --> 00:40:08.270
And I looked at the return address, and it said,

1025
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:10.104
"Department of Psychiatry,

1026
00:40:10.104 --> 00:40:12.590
"University of Illinois in Chicago"

1027
00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.612
Addressed to Dr. Hank Wesselman.

1028
00:40:15.612 --> 00:40:17.834
So I opened it up, and a bunch of reprints fall out--

1029
00:40:17.834 --> 00:40:18.890
One of them is in French--

1030
00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:19.902
and a cover letter.

1031
00:40:20.272 --> 00:40:21.791
And I look at the cover letter, it says,

1032
00:40:21.791 --> 00:40:22.803
"Dear Dr. Wesselman".

1033
00:40:22.803 --> 00:40:24.127
I look at the bottom, it says,

1034
00:40:24.127 --> 00:40:26.786
"Sincerely, Norman S. Dunn, PhD,

1035
00:40:26.786 --> 00:40:29.402
"Co-Director of the Brain Function Lab

1036
00:40:29.402 --> 00:40:32.108
"and Department of Psychiatry, blah, blah, blah".

1037
00:40:32.468 --> 00:40:34.503
So I go back up to the top, and he says,

1038
00:40:34.503 --> 00:40:35.423
"Dear Dr. Wesselman,

1039
00:40:35.423 --> 00:40:37.741
"I just read your book Spiritwalker,

1040
00:40:37.741 --> 00:40:39.053
"and you might be interested to know,

1041
00:40:39.053 --> 00:40:41.473
"that I think I have a very good handle

1042
00:40:41.473 --> 00:40:43.219
"on what you're experiencing."

1043
00:40:43.449 --> 00:40:45.767
Now, in that book, I had tried very hard to

1044
00:40:45.767 --> 00:40:49.217
describe my mystical experiences, as they happened.

1045
00:40:49.217 --> 00:40:49.701
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1046
00:40:49.701 --> 00:40:52.657
<v ->He was able to read my descriptions, and he said to me,</v>

1047
00:40:52.657 --> 00:40:53.991
"You might be interested to know,

1048
00:40:53.991 --> 00:40:55.223
"that back in the 50's,

1049
00:40:55.223 --> 00:40:59.623
"there was a French researcher named Uri Gastaut."

1050
00:41:00.013 --> 00:41:02.795
Uri Gastaut was the world's foremost investigative,

1051
00:41:02.795 --> 00:41:05.051
temporal lobe, epilepsy, at that time.

1052
00:41:05.241 --> 00:41:08.645
He was particularly interested in the

1053
00:41:09.996 --> 00:41:11.459
"samadhi" experience.

1054
00:41:12.485 --> 00:41:14.761
The samadhi experience, which is considered to be

1055
00:41:14.761 --> 00:41:17.991
the direct conscious connection with the Godhood.

1056
00:41:17.991 --> 00:41:18.469
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1057
00:41:18.469 --> 00:41:19.497
<v ->Alright?</v>

1058
00:41:19.497 --> 00:41:22.055
He knew that people who have epileptic seizures,

1059
00:41:22.515 --> 00:41:25.672
went down into theta brainwave patterns,

1060
00:41:26.482 --> 00:41:31.018
in which visionary experience often accompanied the seizure.

1061
00:41:31.018 --> 00:41:31.752
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1062
00:41:31.752 --> 00:41:33.222
<v ->Now, in a nutshell,</v>

1063
00:41:33.222 --> 00:41:36.116
delta waves fire when we're asleep.

1064
00:41:36.116 --> 00:41:39.196
They're at roughly, one to three cycles per second.

1065
00:41:39.196 --> 00:41:41.022
That's Hertz, one to three Hertz.

1066
00:41:41.022 --> 00:41:43.146
Theta waves are just above those,

1067
00:41:43.516 --> 00:41:47.538
at four to seven Hertz, four to seven cycles, per second,

1068
00:41:47.538 --> 00:41:50.794
where meditators go, zen masters go,

1069
00:41:50.794 --> 00:41:54.072
Yogis go there, psychic healers, trance mediums,

1070
00:41:54.072 --> 00:41:54.994
Shamans go there.

1071
00:41:54.994 --> 00:41:56.310
I mean, this has been measured.

1072
00:41:56.932 --> 00:41:59.118
Above theta waves are alpha waves,

1073
00:41:59.118 --> 00:42:01.018
which are kind of like a resting state.

1074
00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:02.264
You're awake and you're aware,

1075
00:42:02.264 --> 00:42:04.838
but you haven't had your first latte, okay?

1076
00:42:04.838 --> 00:42:07.165
So you're not particularly doing anything.

1077
00:42:07.165 --> 00:42:10.481
But then, they fire at roughly eight to 13 per second,

1078
00:42:10.481 --> 00:42:13.189
and above those, are the beta brainwaves states,

1079
00:42:13.189 --> 00:42:14.949
where we're focused, where we're conscious,

1080
00:42:14.949 --> 00:42:15.895
where we're doing things.

1081
00:42:15.895 --> 00:42:17.637
We're concentrating, you're working.

1082
00:42:17.637 --> 00:42:20.955
Roughly 13 to 20, 25 per second,

1083
00:42:20.955 --> 00:42:24.981
generating, roughly, eight to 10 to 15 microvolts

1084
00:42:24.981 --> 00:42:26.991
of amplitude in the brain.

1085
00:42:27.687 --> 00:42:31.130
This man went to India, looking for a guru,

1086
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:34.669
who could achieve the samadhi ecstasy at will.

1087
00:42:35.028 --> 00:42:36.311
And he found one.

1088
00:42:36.931 --> 00:42:39.042
He found a guru in an ashram in India,

1089
00:42:39.042 --> 00:42:42.628
who was teaching Kundalini yoga, Kriya yoga.

1090
00:42:43.518 --> 00:42:46.821
And he ran some tests, using an EEG machine,

1091
00:42:47.241 --> 00:42:50.468
and an EMG machine, to measure muscle tension.

1092
00:42:50.708 --> 00:42:53.736
Now, the EEG machine, he hooked up all the guru students.

1093
00:42:53.736 --> 00:42:55.188
None of 'em could do it.

1094
00:42:55.738 --> 00:42:56.777
But the guru could.

1095
00:42:57.967 --> 00:43:00.121
And when the guru allowed himself to be measured

1096
00:43:00.121 --> 00:43:01.881
for his brainwaves,

1097
00:43:02.511 --> 00:43:04.460
he went into the samadhi ecstasy state,

1098
00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.540
and his brainwaves went way out beyond beta.

1099
00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.562
They didn't drop down into theta.

1100
00:43:09.562 --> 00:43:12.482
They went out to 30 and 40 Hertz.

1101
00:43:13.232 --> 00:43:14.491
That's way out there.

1102
00:43:14.491 --> 00:43:14.975
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1103
00:43:14.975 --> 00:43:18.221
<v ->Generating between 30 and 40, 50 microvolts of amplitude.</v>

1104
00:43:18.221 --> 00:43:18.834
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1105
00:43:18.834 --> 00:43:19.907
<v ->He did it twice.</v>

1106
00:43:20.477 --> 00:43:23.154
Now, nobody in the neuro-physiological community

1107
00:43:23.154 --> 00:43:25.033
had ever seen this before.

1108
00:43:25.033 --> 00:43:26.881
So Gastaut published it, in French,

1109
00:43:26.881 --> 00:43:28.201
in a peer-reviewed journal,

1110
00:43:28.511 --> 00:43:32.794
and that journal, that article, really stood unchallenged,

1111
00:43:32.794 --> 00:43:34.158
for more than 40 years.

1112
00:43:34.158 --> 00:43:35.574
Cause nobody knew what to do with it.

1113
00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.788
It became known as the Gamma rhythm.

1114
00:43:38.238 --> 00:43:39.944
I say that because we know more about it today.

1115
00:43:39.944 --> 00:43:40.790
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1116
00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.958
But when Norman Dunn wrote to me, he said,

1117
00:43:42.958 --> 00:43:44.630
"This is what I think you're doing.

1118
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:45.708
"I think you're going out into these

1119
00:43:45.708 --> 00:43:47.272
"40 Hertz brainwave states.

1120
00:43:47.272 --> 00:43:49.402
"I'd like to run some tests on your brain."

1121
00:43:49.968 --> 00:43:52.396
So I thought, "This is really, really great."

1122
00:43:52.396 --> 00:43:53.342
(Regina chuckles)

1123
00:43:53.342 --> 00:43:54.926
You know, I was hoping somebody in the scientific community

1124
00:43:55.506 --> 00:43:58.513
would, you know, pick up on this book.

1125
00:44:00.003 --> 00:44:02.800
To make a long story short, he came here to Sacramento.

1126
00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:05.616
He wired my brain for sound, so to speak.

1127
00:44:05.616 --> 00:44:07.332
And we ran tests on my brain.

1128
00:44:07.332 --> 00:44:10.170
He got all my brainwaves, in resting states,

1129
00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:12.306
and beta states and theta states.

1130
00:44:12.306 --> 00:44:15.142
No epileptic form patterns, nor any brain disease,

1131
00:44:15.142 --> 00:44:16.660
No tumors, nothing like that--

1132
00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:17.672
<v Regina>So your baseline.</v>

1133
00:44:17.672 --> 00:44:19.674
<v ->He said, "Alright, I want you to see you</v>

1134
00:44:19.674 --> 00:44:21.214
"access this state."

1135
00:44:21.214 --> 00:44:22.974
Now, I could do this for him,

1136
00:44:22.974 --> 00:44:26.986
because over 10 years of having these experiences,

1137
00:44:26.986 --> 00:44:30.388
my body soul retained the frequency of vibration,

1138
00:44:30.388 --> 00:44:32.016
for these deep trance states,

1139
00:44:32.016 --> 00:44:34.810
in which I go into this state where I become paralyzed,

1140
00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:37.318
(mumbles), I can do it now,

1141
00:44:37.318 --> 00:44:39.050
at any time, any place.

1142
00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.344
So I opened up that inner doorway,

1143
00:44:41.344 --> 00:44:43.006
which is how I think of it,

1144
00:44:43.006 --> 00:44:46.280
and allowed the power to flood into my body.

1145
00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.714
And I held it for about 15 seconds,

1146
00:44:48.714 --> 00:44:51.134
trying not to move, because you're not supposed to move,

1147
00:44:51.134 --> 00:44:53.290
with all these wires going off my head.

1148
00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.468
He's sitting behind me watching the computer.

1149
00:44:56.728 --> 00:44:59.072
He comes-- I come out of it, I close it down,

1150
00:44:59.072 --> 00:45:01.231
and I turn and I said, "Did you get anything?"

1151
00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:02.680
And he says to me,

1152
00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:04.908
"You can really do this, can't you?"

1153
00:45:05.228 --> 00:45:06.524
And I'm thinking to myself,

1154
00:45:06.524 --> 00:45:08.980
"Why would I say I could do this if I couldn't do this?

1155
00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:09.882
"Why would I waste his time, and mine?"

1156
00:45:09.882 --> 00:45:11.532
<v Regina>(laughs) Embarrass yourself.</v>

1157
00:45:11.532 --> 00:45:12.726
<v ->I suppose there are a lot of people</v>

1158
00:45:12.726 --> 00:45:13.788
who think they can do it.

1159
00:45:13.788 --> 00:45:14.426
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1160
00:45:14.426 --> 00:45:15.981
<v ->Then he asked me a very male question.</v>

1161
00:45:15.981 --> 00:45:17.349
He said, "Can you do it again?

1162
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:18.061
(Regina laughs)

1163
00:45:18.061 --> 00:45:20.020
"Cause the guru could only do it twice."

1164
00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.842
So over the next hour,

1165
00:45:21.842 --> 00:45:24.174
I opened and closed that inner doorway,

1166
00:45:24.174 --> 00:45:25.692
a dozen more times,

1167
00:45:25.692 --> 00:45:27.738
giving him 13, a baker's dozen.

1168
00:45:28.048 --> 00:45:30.533
And in all 13 of these trials,

1169
00:45:30.533 --> 00:45:34.229
my brain was going out to 40 and 50 Hertz,

1170
00:45:34.229 --> 00:45:37.705
generating between 50 and 60 microvolts of amplitude.

1171
00:45:37.705 --> 00:45:38.519
<v Regina>Wow.</v>

1172
00:45:38.519 --> 00:45:41.819
<v ->With maximum effect focused in the prefrontals,</v>

1173
00:45:41.819 --> 00:45:43.227
and frontal lobes,

1174
00:45:43.777 --> 00:45:45.432
and the visual cortex in the back.

1175
00:45:45.432 --> 00:45:47.214
In other words, it wasn't in the temporal lobes at all.

1176
00:45:47.214 --> 00:45:47.758
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1177
00:45:48.008 --> 00:45:48.798
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1178
00:45:48.798 --> 00:45:51.501
Now, this, to me, was absolutely beautiful, because,

1179
00:45:51.501 --> 00:45:54.820
this was validation for everything that I had written about

1180
00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.499
in my book Spiritwalker.

1181
00:45:56.988 --> 00:45:59.248
And in fact, there's a chapter in my third volume,

1182
00:45:59.248 --> 00:46:00.524
Visionseeker--

1183
00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:01.712
the chapter is called

1184
00:46:01.712 --> 00:46:03.670
The Gateway to Transcendent Experience,

1185
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:06.134
in which all of this brainwave work is recorded,

1186
00:46:06.134 --> 00:46:07.512
with references.

1187
00:46:07.512 --> 00:46:07.944
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1188
00:46:07.944 --> 00:46:09.302
<v ->Scientific references.</v>

1189
00:46:09.302 --> 00:46:10.116
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1190
00:46:10.116 --> 00:46:12.911
<v ->Now, he came over to my house afterwards, for lunch.</v>

1191
00:46:13.241 --> 00:46:16.150
And he looked at my wife, and he said to Jill, he said,

1192
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:17.734
"You have a very unusual husband."

1193
00:46:17.734 --> 00:46:20.022
Of course my wife is looking at him as if to say,

1194
00:46:20.022 --> 00:46:21.320
"Tell me something else I don't know."

1195
00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.060
(Regina laughs)

1196
00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.388
Because she'd been there with me,

1197
00:46:23.388 --> 00:46:24.256
through all of this, you see.

1198
00:46:24.256 --> 00:46:25.012
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1199
00:46:25.732 --> 00:46:28.463
He said, "No," he said, "when I was working in Brazil,

1200
00:46:28.463 --> 00:46:30.069
"on an NIH Grant"--

1201
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:34.711
He was working on trance mediums, Shamans, psychic healers,

1202
00:46:35.261 --> 00:46:38.298
recording topographical brain maps.

1203
00:46:38.298 --> 00:46:41.598
He had brain maps on over 100 subjects, in altered states.

1204
00:46:41.598 --> 00:46:44.722
That's a big sample.

1205
00:46:44.722 --> 00:46:47.801
He said he'd only been able to find 13 other people,

1206
00:46:48.213 --> 00:46:51.255
who could achieve these 40 Hertz brainwaves states,

1207
00:46:51.255 --> 00:46:52.694
these Gamma rhythm states.

1208
00:46:53.119 --> 00:46:54.633
And here comes the kicker.

1209
00:46:56.259 --> 00:47:01.259
All 13 of them have had the alien abduction experience.

1210
00:47:03.139 --> 00:47:04.753
<v Regina>That's interesting.</v>

1211
00:47:04.937 --> 00:47:05.792
<v ->Isn't this interesting?</v>

1212
00:47:05.792 --> 00:47:07.254
<v Regina>Very much, yes.</v>

1213
00:47:07.254 --> 00:47:09.132
<v ->They all claim that they couldn't do it,</v>

1214
00:47:09.132 --> 00:47:11.161
until they'd had this experience.

1215
00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:12.326
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1216
00:47:12.986 --> 00:47:16.243
And, like me, they could step into it, out of it, at will.

1217
00:47:16.243 --> 00:47:19.433
Like me, they claimed to talk to spirits, to see them,

1218
00:47:19.433 --> 00:47:20.555
to interact with them.

1219
00:47:20.555 --> 00:47:22.953
Some of them even claimed to speak directly with God.

1220
00:47:22.953 --> 00:47:23.701
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1221
00:47:23.701 --> 00:47:24.427
<v ->Alright?</v>

1222
00:47:24.427 --> 00:47:25.523
They were able to do various things,

1223
00:47:25.523 --> 00:47:26.855
like healing work, for others.

1224
00:47:26.855 --> 00:47:27.793
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1225
00:47:27.793 --> 00:47:29.795
<v ->And of course, this all makes a lot of sense,</v>

1226
00:47:29.795 --> 00:47:32.787
once you understand-- and this is known now--

1227
00:47:32.787 --> 00:47:35.119
that the physical structure of the brain--

1228
00:47:35.119 --> 00:47:36.791
and I'm talking about the cerebrum--

1229
00:47:37.511 --> 00:47:41.736
can change its structure in as little as 15 minutes,

1230
00:47:41.736 --> 00:47:45.058
in response to a powerful altered state of consciousness.

1231
00:47:45.058 --> 00:47:45.828
<v Regina>Hmmm.</v>

1232
00:47:45.828 --> 00:47:47.742
<v ->This is how learning is laid down.</v>

1233
00:47:47.742 --> 00:47:48.512
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1234
00:47:48.512 --> 00:47:50.558
<v ->The physical structure of the brain</v>

1235
00:47:50.558 --> 00:47:53.732
actually changes, and rewiring occurs,

1236
00:47:53.732 --> 00:47:56.630
and once that happens, you've got the program.

1237
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:58.632
You've essentially been programmed.

1238
00:47:59.242 --> 00:48:02.244
<v Regina>So, is this something that has to happen</v>

1239
00:48:02.244 --> 00:48:03.696
personally and organically?

1240
00:48:03.696 --> 00:48:05.104
Or is this a place people, then,

1241
00:48:05.104 --> 00:48:07.238
can take themselves or learn from books,

1242
00:48:07.238 --> 00:48:09.020
such as your series of books?

1243
00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:11.007
<v ->I'll tell you what I think.</v>

1244
00:48:11.007 --> 00:48:12.652
I think that most of us

1245
00:48:12.652 --> 00:48:15.195
have a program on our inner hard drive.

1246
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:17.300
Alright?

1247
00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:18.768
But like most programs on a hard drive,

1248
00:48:18.768 --> 00:48:19.892
you get a new computer.

1249
00:48:19.892 --> 00:48:21.597
You turn it on, you wanna set up your email or

1250
00:48:21.597 --> 00:48:22.807
<v Hank>your internet--</v>
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1251
00:48:22.807 --> 00:48:24.567
<v ->You know, the Safari, you know--</v>

1252
00:48:24.567 --> 00:48:25.799
<v Regina>You need your programming manual.</v>

1253
00:48:25.799 --> 00:48:27.735
<v ->Right, I mean, who knows what this computer can do?</v>

1254
00:48:27.735 --> 00:48:28.395
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1255
00:48:28.395 --> 00:48:29.385
<v ->You know, you don't really know,</v>

1256
00:48:29.385 --> 00:48:31.123
and like most programs, it just sits there,

1257
00:48:31.123 --> 00:48:32.619
until you double-click it and bring it up.

1258
00:48:32.619 --> 00:48:33.405
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1259
00:48:33.705 --> 00:48:36.775
<v ->See, for me, sexuality double-clicked my program.</v>

1260
00:48:37.275 --> 00:48:41.474
The drum, the rattle, can double-click the program.

1261
00:48:41.702 --> 00:48:44.042
Hallucinogens, physical exhaustion,

1262
00:48:44.042 --> 00:48:46.660
dancing, singing, chanting.

1263
00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:49.322
All of these are ways of double-clicking the program.

1264
00:48:49.992 --> 00:48:52.730
This is a learned skill that improves with practice,

1265
00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:54.754
and this is what I do in my workshops.

1266
00:48:55.024 --> 00:48:56.387
You know, for those who are interested,

1267
00:48:56.387 --> 00:48:58.293
my website is sharedwisdom.com,

1268
00:48:58.293 --> 00:48:59.133
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1269
00:48:59.133 --> 00:49:02.124
<v ->And, you know, our schedule is constantly changing,</v>

1270
00:49:02.764 --> 00:49:04.541
from moment to moment, so--

1271
00:49:04.541 --> 00:49:05.531
<v Regina>And you're all over, you're--</v>

1272
00:49:05.531 --> 00:49:06.209
I've seen your workshops--

1273
00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:07.011
<v ->It's a good way to check in.</v>

1274
00:49:07.011 --> 00:49:08.501
Well, I do about 40 workshops a year.

1275
00:49:08.501 --> 00:49:09.513
<v Regina>Right, all over the world, truly.</v>

1276
00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:10.371
<v ->All over the world.</v>

1277
00:49:10.371 --> 00:49:10.987
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1278
00:49:10.987 --> 00:49:12.945
And this is an international audience, well,

1279
00:49:13.955 --> 00:49:15.797
not only do you have your workshops going,

1280
00:49:15.797 --> 00:49:18.483
but you're still getting your fingernails dirty,

1281
00:49:18.723 --> 00:49:21.231
and you're on your way to Ethiopia,

1282
00:49:21.231 --> 00:49:24.135
and this is an incredibly exciting project.

1283
00:49:24.135 --> 00:49:26.247
Tell-- if you'd tell us a little bit about

1284
00:49:26.247 --> 00:49:28.139
what you're working on and the scope of it,

1285
00:49:28.139 --> 00:49:30.119
which is massive,

1286
00:49:30.119 --> 00:49:32.209
and how this interfaces with your other

1287
00:49:32.209 --> 00:49:34.101
internal, spiritual work.

1288
00:49:34.491 --> 00:49:36.035
<v ->Well, in my scientific work,</v>

1289
00:49:36.035 --> 00:49:37.467
I mentioned at the beginning,

1290
00:49:37.467 --> 00:49:39.827
that I have been involved with this interesting crew,

1291
00:49:39.827 --> 00:49:41.291
for the last 30 years,

1292
00:49:41.291 --> 00:49:43.484
doing paleo-anthropological field work.

1293
00:49:43.865 --> 00:49:47.898
In 1994 and '95, I was in the field in Ethiopia,

1294
00:49:47.898 --> 00:49:49.768
in the middle of Awash Valley,

1295
00:49:49.768 --> 00:49:51.682
with an expedition which was headed

1296
00:49:51.682 --> 00:49:54.136
by Dr. Tim White of UC Berkeley,

1297
00:49:54.136 --> 00:49:57.900
and Dr. Berhane Asfaw of the Ethiopian National Museum.

1298
00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:01.098
And we uncovered the fossilized remains

1299
00:50:01.508 --> 00:50:04.772
of an early human which is so primitive,

1300
00:50:04.772 --> 00:50:07.522
that this may, in fact, be the famous "missing link,"

1301
00:50:07.522 --> 00:50:10.826
that Charles Darwin predicted we would eventually find.

1302
00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:13.534
We have, roughly, half of a skeleton,

1303
00:50:13.534 --> 00:50:16.124
which is a million and a half years older than Lucy,

1304
00:50:16.124 --> 00:50:19.160
for your listeners who know about Lucy.

1305
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:22.966
It's been named in the Genus Ardipithecus,

1306
00:50:23.256 --> 00:50:24.748
and the species ramidus.

1307
00:50:24.748 --> 00:50:26.398
Ardipithecus ramidus,

1308
00:50:26.398 --> 00:50:30.556
and since '94, '95, we've actually got an earlier form of it

1309
00:50:30.556 --> 00:50:32.536
called Ardipithecus kadabba,

1310
00:50:32.536 --> 00:50:36.364
which is around 5.7, 5.8 million,

1311
00:50:36.364 --> 00:50:38.718
close to the six million year time mark.

1312
00:50:38.718 --> 00:50:40.786
Now the reason this is interesting is that

1313
00:50:40.786 --> 00:50:42.392
molecular biology

1314
00:50:42.392 --> 00:50:44.768
has shown that human beings and the african apes

1315
00:50:44.768 --> 00:50:46.792
are remarkably close.

1316
00:50:46.792 --> 00:50:51.258
We actually share 98.6%

1317
00:50:51.258 --> 00:50:52.938
of our DNA in common,

1318
00:50:52.938 --> 00:50:54.152
with chimpanzees,

1319
00:50:54.513 --> 00:50:57.717
which means that the relationship between us is very close.

1320
00:50:57.717 --> 00:50:59.741
It means, in molecular terms,

1321
00:50:59.741 --> 00:51:01.963
that there had to be a division,

1322
00:51:01.963 --> 00:51:03.613
between the ape lineage,

1323
00:51:03.613 --> 00:51:05.791
and the lineage which would evolve into humans,

1324
00:51:06.991 --> 00:51:09.368
somewhere, maybe, seven million,

1325
00:51:09.368 --> 00:51:10.886
maybe six million years ago,

1326
00:51:10.886 --> 00:51:13.517
and we seem to have found

1327
00:51:13.517 --> 00:51:14.813
the dividing point.

1328
00:51:14.813 --> 00:51:17.937
We seem to have found that first species

1329
00:51:17.937 --> 00:51:20.489
that is moving towards something which is going to

1330
00:51:20.489 --> 00:51:22.469
manifestly become human.

1331
00:51:22.989 --> 00:51:26.137
Now this, when it's published,

1332
00:51:27.233 --> 00:51:29.947
in 2006, 2007,

1333
00:51:30.492 --> 00:51:32.634
it's going to make the front cover of every newspaper

1334
00:51:32.634 --> 00:51:34.262
and every magazine in the world.

1335
00:51:34.262 --> 00:51:36.505
Because this is the earliest ancestor.

1336
00:51:37.012 --> 00:51:39.731
My job is to go to these sites where

1337
00:51:39.731 --> 00:51:41.755
major discoveries have been found,

1338
00:51:41.755 --> 00:51:44.197
and reconstruct the Paleo-environments,

1339
00:51:44.197 --> 00:51:46.859
of those sites at the time they were laid down.

1340
00:51:47.239 --> 00:51:49.194
So I go and I take all the sediments,

1341
00:51:49.194 --> 00:51:52.142
and pass them through very fine screens with water.

1342
00:51:52.142 --> 00:51:56.102
I literally wash the sands, and the clays, and the silts.

1343
00:51:56.102 --> 00:51:58.148
And this allows all the fine grain sediments

1344
00:51:58.148 --> 00:51:59.886
to go through the screens,

1345
00:51:59.886 --> 00:52:02.598
and it retains all the courser gravels,

1346
00:52:02.998 --> 00:52:05.364
which contain the bones of very small mammals,

1347
00:52:05.364 --> 00:52:08.762
like bats, shrews, rodents, small carnivores.

1348
00:52:08.762 --> 00:52:09.659
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1349
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:14.380
<v ->Now, these small mammals are very habitat specific.</v>

1350
00:52:14.767 --> 00:52:18.015
Unlike elephants, that live lives of very long duration

1351
00:52:18.015 --> 00:52:19.761
in huge (mumbles) ranches,

1352
00:52:19.761 --> 00:52:22.726
you know, rodents only live to be two or three years old,

1353
00:52:22.726 --> 00:52:25.466
and they tend to be very habitat specific.

1354
00:52:25.771 --> 00:52:27.702
So you get specific kinds in forests,

1355
00:52:27.702 --> 00:52:30.012
specific kinds in patchy environments,

1356
00:52:30.012 --> 00:52:32.220
specific kinds in places where it's moist,

1357
00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:34.412
places where it's dry, in savannahs,

1358
00:52:34.412 --> 00:52:37.226
in arid zones, in deserts, and so forth.

1359
00:52:37.496 --> 00:52:39.714
If I can find them, I can tell a great deal about

1360
00:52:39.714 --> 00:52:42.200
the environment at the time it was laid down.

1361
00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:46.688
So, I went out into the desert, in '94, '95, '96,

1362
00:52:46.688 --> 00:52:48.282
with the expedition,

1363
00:52:48.282 --> 00:52:50.746
and I was fantastically successful.

1364
00:52:50.916 --> 00:52:53.760
Now, we would never say that we used magic to do this.

1365
00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:56.632
But, you know, the fact is, that, we--

1366
00:52:56.632 --> 00:53:00.968
I was able to recover almost 2,000 fossil specimens,

1367
00:53:00.968 --> 00:53:01.978
in a very short period of time,

1368
00:53:01.978 --> 00:53:03.510
(Regina chuckles)

1369
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:06.764
representing about 40 different species of small mammals,

1370
00:53:06.764 --> 00:53:08.754
in all sorts of different families,

1371
00:53:08.754 --> 00:53:10.998
and all sorts of different groups.

1372
00:53:10.998 --> 00:53:13.792
I mean, bats, shrews, rodents and so forth.

1373
00:53:13.792 --> 00:53:17.070
So I'm in the last stages of my analysis now,

1374
00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:20.760
of this fossilized material.

1375
00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.634
This fossil fauna, really.

1376
00:53:22.634 --> 00:53:26.002
And it will probably result in a monograph that will

1377
00:53:26.002 --> 00:53:28.510
end up in describing about,

1378
00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:31.018
maybe 20 new species of fossil mammals.

1379
00:53:31.018 --> 00:53:31.744
<v Regina>Hmmm.</v>

1380
00:53:31.744 --> 00:53:34.098
<v ->And, so I'm off to Ethiopia for a month,</v>

1381
00:53:34.098 --> 00:53:36.584
to use a digital camera,

1382
00:53:36.584 --> 00:53:39.736
and a big binocular microscope combination,

1383
00:53:39.736 --> 00:53:42.238
to photograph all of these small fossils,

1384
00:53:42.238 --> 00:53:45.498
so that eventually we will get them all on the internet.

1385
00:53:45.498 --> 00:53:49.762
It's part of a large complex called RHOI.

1386
00:53:49.762 --> 00:53:53.982
The RHOI is the Research Hominids Origins Initiative,

1387
00:53:54.408 --> 00:53:56.474
and it's going to be a ma-- it's a major research--

1388
00:53:56.474 --> 00:53:58.276
international research project,

1389
00:53:58.276 --> 00:54:00.524
of which I'm a member of that team.

1390
00:54:00.524 --> 00:54:03.280
And so I'll be in Ethiopia for about a month,

1391
00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.030
doing research,

1392
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:06.724
and then I'll be stopping in France,

1393
00:54:07.034 --> 00:54:08.858
at the University of Poitiers,

1394
00:54:08.858 --> 00:54:11.060
and the Naturalized Museum in Paris,

1395
00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:12.226
on my way home.

1396
00:54:12.226 --> 00:54:13.876
<v Regina>So is this more or less your day job?</v>

1397
00:54:13.876 --> 00:54:15.900
Or do these two branch off? (laughs)

1398
00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:17.352
<v ->I know, that's an interesting question.</v>

1399
00:54:17.352 --> 00:54:18.320
<v Regina>I mean, it sounds like some of your</v>

1400
00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:19.948
unseen helpers are helping you,

1401
00:54:20.988 --> 00:54:23.324
assemble these specimens.

1402
00:54:23.474 --> 00:54:25.002
<v ->Well, you know, I'm very clear.</v>

1403
00:54:25.002 --> 00:54:25.590
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1404
00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:27.438
When I'm doing science, I'm doing science.

1405
00:54:27.438 --> 00:54:27.856
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1406
00:54:27.856 --> 00:54:31.466
I'm very highly trained at the level of intellect, right?

1407
00:54:31.466 --> 00:54:32.972
<v Regina>Right.</v>
<v Hank>That mental soul.</v>

1408
00:54:32.972 --> 00:54:34.954
When I'm working in the world of the Shaman,

1409
00:54:35.224 --> 00:54:37.250
I'm using my body soul,

1410
00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:39.012
because that's where the doorway is.

1411
00:54:39.262 --> 00:54:40.924
And when that doorway opens,

1412
00:54:40.924 --> 00:54:43.388
I connect with my spiritual friends,

1413
00:54:43.388 --> 00:54:46.226
and invite them to come in to be of service to people.

1414
00:54:46.746 --> 00:54:47.924
Things happen.

1415
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:51.572
You know, when the bridge is formed, miracles occur.

1416
00:54:51.742 --> 00:54:53.948
And over the years we've been doing this work,

1417
00:54:53.948 --> 00:54:57.263
we usually do healing rituals, as part of every workshop.

1418
00:54:57.263 --> 00:54:58.703
You know, I've watched people with

1419
00:54:58.703 --> 00:55:01.585
very serious life-threatening illnesses recover,

1420
00:55:01.585 --> 00:55:03.609
as a result of a single healing ritual.

1421
00:55:03.609 --> 00:55:06.337
I mean we're talking about recovery from things like cancer,

1422
00:55:06.757 --> 00:55:11.757
lupus, Crohn's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis.

1423
00:55:12.746 --> 00:55:15.034
Now, I'm not claiming to be able to work miracles.

1424
00:55:15.034 --> 00:55:17.190
Because I'm very clear on the fact that I'm

1425
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:19.412
really not doing anything at all.

1426
00:55:19.412 --> 00:55:22.206
It's the others, who come in,

1427
00:55:22.206 --> 00:55:24.736
who seem to be able to come in and do this work,

1428
00:55:24.736 --> 00:55:27.354
on behalf of individuals who are healed.

1429
00:55:27.354 --> 00:55:28.872
<v Regina>But you, you use drumming and such, too.</v>

1430
00:55:28.872 --> 00:55:29.378
<v ->We do.</v>

1431
00:55:29.378 --> 00:55:31.710
<v Regina>So people are in a very open, expansive state,</v>

1432
00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:35.014
which allows them to be, maybe a little bit more receptive?

1433
00:55:35.204 --> 00:55:35.692
<v ->We do.</v>

1434
00:55:35.692 --> 00:55:37.540
In fact, we use the whole group.

1435
00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:38.112
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1436
00:55:38.112 --> 00:55:40.454
<v ->Because, by the time you have 30 people,</v>

1437
00:55:40.454 --> 00:55:42.578
in a focused altered state,

1438
00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.224
focusing their compassionate feelings,

1439
00:55:45.224 --> 00:55:47.374
for the individual who is suffering,

1440
00:55:47.374 --> 00:55:50.828
that individual's body soul picks up on this.

1441
00:55:50.828 --> 00:55:51.422
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1442
00:55:51.422 --> 00:55:53.864
<v ->Because the body soul is the perceiver of what's seen,</v>

1443
00:55:53.864 --> 00:55:55.294
and what is unseen.

1444
00:55:55.294 --> 00:55:58.396
And so the body soul will internalize all this

1445
00:55:58.396 --> 00:56:01.476
energetic assistance from all these people in the room,

1446
00:56:01.476 --> 00:56:03.434
including all the spirits in the room,

1447
00:56:03.434 --> 00:56:07.658
restore the matrix of that person's energy screen,

1448
00:56:07.658 --> 00:56:09.000
or pattern, what's--

1449
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:09.616
<v Regina>Grid.</v>

1450
00:56:09.616 --> 00:56:10.540
<v Hank>if you will.</v>
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1451
00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:12.008
<v ->Their energy grid.</v>

1452
00:56:12.008 --> 00:56:15.512
And once the screen has been restored,

1453
00:56:15.512 --> 00:56:18.264
once the soul has been restored, essentially,

1454
00:56:18.264 --> 00:56:20.264
the body tends to recover.

1455
00:56:20.974 --> 00:56:23.193
So, you know, I've been drawn into the world

1456
00:56:23.193 --> 00:56:24.711
of the Shamanic healer.

1457
00:56:25.211 --> 00:56:26.936
And for the Shamanic healer,

1458
00:56:28.246 --> 00:56:30.267
they have a very interesting perspective

1459
00:56:30.267 --> 00:56:32.793
on how healing actually works.

1460
00:56:32.793 --> 00:56:36.687
They understand that, all illness usually finds its source

1461
00:56:36.687 --> 00:56:38.447
in three primary causes.

1462
00:56:38.447 --> 00:56:39.581
Disharmony,

1463
00:56:40.251 --> 00:56:41.143
fear,

1464
00:56:41.755 --> 00:56:43.017
and soul loss.

1465
00:56:43.683 --> 00:56:46.121
Soul loss is the most dangerous of these.

1466
00:56:46.121 --> 00:56:48.627
Soul loss is a state that we experience,

1467
00:56:48.627 --> 00:56:51.134
when we've had a serious trauma,

1468
00:56:52.065 --> 00:56:55.189
Okay, when we have lost a loved one.

1469
00:56:55.189 --> 00:56:57.279
When we've been in a serious car accident,

1470
00:56:57.279 --> 00:56:58.993
had a serious surgery.

1471
00:56:59.493 --> 00:57:00.737
When we've been molested--

1472
00:57:00.737 --> 00:57:01.327
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1473
00:57:01.327 --> 00:57:02.273
<v ->or raped.</v>

1474
00:57:02.273 --> 00:57:04.203
Or when we've been in combat.

1475
00:57:04.203 --> 00:57:04.737
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1476
00:57:04.737 --> 00:57:05.595
<v ->Right?</v>

1477
00:57:05.595 --> 00:57:08.807
Very often parts of the self disassociate and leave,

1478
00:57:08.807 --> 00:57:10.378
in response to the trauma.

1479
00:57:10.378 --> 00:57:10.903
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1480
00:57:10.903 --> 00:57:12.625
<v ->The Shaman is the specialist,</v>

1481
00:57:12.625 --> 00:57:15.143
in restoring that person's power,

1482
00:57:15.143 --> 00:57:17.277
extracting intrusive elements,

1483
00:57:17.277 --> 00:57:19.235
like negative thoughts and feelings,

1484
00:57:19.235 --> 00:57:21.853
and then restoring the person's soul--

1485
00:57:21.853 --> 00:57:23.657
the fabric of the person's soul--

1486
00:57:23.657 --> 00:57:25.527
through soul retrieval work.

1487
00:57:25.527 --> 00:57:26.913
This is the work my wife does.

1488
00:57:27.253 --> 00:57:28.343
Jill Kuykendall.

1489
00:57:28.343 --> 00:57:29.865
She's very good at it.

1490
00:57:30.257 --> 00:57:31.170
And once again, you know,

1491
00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:32.734
if people come to our website,

1492
00:57:32.734 --> 00:57:33.958
sharedwisdom.com,

1493
00:57:33.958 --> 00:57:34.762
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1494
00:57:34.762 --> 00:57:35.996
<v ->They can look at her page,</v>

1495
00:57:35.996 --> 00:57:37.638
and see what it is that she does.

1496
00:57:37.638 --> 00:57:38.518
<v Regina>Very good.</v>

1497
00:57:38.518 --> 00:57:41.862
Well, I'm hoping this is only the first of many discussions.

1498
00:57:41.862 --> 00:57:42.764
<v ->Hey, me too.</v>

1499
00:57:42.764 --> 00:57:45.030
<v Regina>Time permitting, because you're on fire,</v>

1500
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:46.460
both on the Shamanic path,

1501
00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:48.154
and you're going to be making the headlines

1502
00:57:48.154 --> 00:57:52.114
on your other work as well, it sounds like, in 2006 and '07,

1503
00:57:52.114 --> 00:57:54.382
so we're going to pester you and stay with you

1504
00:57:54.382 --> 00:57:55.722
wherever we can.

1505
00:57:55.722 --> 00:57:58.185
<v ->Well, thank you very much for the time. (claps hands)</v>

1506
00:57:58.185 --> 00:57:58.999
<v Regina>Thank you.</v>

1507
00:58:02.239 --> 00:58:03.927
When Hank is not out on a dig,

1508
00:58:03.927 --> 00:58:05.687
he spends much of his time on the road,

1509
00:58:05.687 --> 00:58:07.535
lecturing and teaching workshops.

1510
00:58:07.535 --> 00:58:09.713
So please take a look at our events calendar,

1511
00:58:09.713 --> 00:58:11.869
to see where he'll be appearing next.

1512
00:58:11.869 --> 00:58:14.087
Until next time, thanks for watching.

1513
00:58:14.087 --> 00:58:18.598
(modern electronic keyboard music)
