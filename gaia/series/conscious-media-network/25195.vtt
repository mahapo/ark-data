00:00:13.777 --> 00:00:15.577
<v ->One of my great fascinations in life</v>

3
00:00:15.577 --> 00:00:17.817
has been the origins of humankind.

4
00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:18.757
Every now and again,

5
00:00:18.757 --> 00:00:20.117
I come across a body of work

6
00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:22.017
that both deepens my understanding

7
00:00:22.017 --> 00:00:24.496
and validates what I've already learned.

8
00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:26.296
While at the Edgar Cayce Institute,

9
00:00:26.296 --> 00:00:27.817
I had the opportunity to speak

10
00:00:27.817 --> 00:00:29.417
with John Van Auken,

11
00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:31.016
who is a Cayce scholar,

12
00:00:31.016 --> 00:00:33.616
having studied the works for more than 40 years.

13
00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:35.936
John offers us a glimpse into our development

14
00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:37.997
as a species, as few do,

15
00:00:37.997 --> 00:00:40.587
and one that I resonate with deeply.

16
00:00:41.476 --> 00:00:43.077
<v Voiceover>I've wanted to talk to you for a while</v>

17
00:00:43.077 --> 00:00:44.477
about a lot of different things,

18
00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.457
but since we have just a short period of time,

19
00:00:46.457 --> 00:00:48.717
we're going to get right to one of my passions,

20
00:00:48.717 --> 00:00:53.496
which is speaking through Edgar Cayce's lens

21
00:00:53.496 --> 00:00:56.697
and whatever you've overlayed on that

22
00:00:56.697 --> 00:00:57.677
through the years,

23
00:00:57.677 --> 00:00:59.717
and you've been involved since you were 16 years old,

24
00:00:59.717 --> 00:01:00.657
so it's been a while.

25
00:01:00.657 --> 00:01:01.297
<v ->Yeah. Mm-hm.</v>

26
00:01:01.297 --> 00:01:02.236
<v Voiceover>With the Edgar Cayce readings.</v>

27
00:01:02.236 --> 00:01:04.357
You're one of the top scholars

28
00:01:04.357 --> 00:01:06.777
on the Edgar Cayce readings in the world.

29
00:01:06.777 --> 00:01:09.056
I'd like to talk about the origins

30
00:01:09.056 --> 00:01:10.977
of the human species,

31
00:01:10.977 --> 00:01:12.977
our multi-dimensional origins,

32
00:01:12.977 --> 00:01:15.077
so we can talk about where we came from,

33
00:01:15.077 --> 00:01:16.176
what we've descended to,

34
00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:19.317
and, to me, most importantly,

35
00:01:19.317 --> 00:01:24.157
what we're emerging back into as of who we truly are.

36
00:01:24.157 --> 00:01:26.433
So let's just start with the beginning.

37
00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:27.759
<v ->Alright.</v>

38
00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.799
Well, from Edgar Cayce's perspective,

39
00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.879
there was an involution into matter

40
00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:38.119
before the evolution up through matter.

41
00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.499
So even though all of us are very familiar

42
00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:42.179
with the evolution,

43
00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.099
not too many of us are aware

44
00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:48.785
of the the involution out of energy, mind, spirit,

45
00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:50.665
into matter,

46
00:01:50.665 --> 00:01:54.785
and that we existed for a long time,

47
00:01:54.785 --> 00:01:57.945
long before we became physical

48
00:01:57.945 --> 00:02:01.345
and into these physical vehicles that we use.

49
00:02:01.345 --> 00:02:04.285
The mind, the spirit, the life essence,

50
00:02:04.285 --> 00:02:06.805
or as the Egyptians call it, the ka,

51
00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:10.165
existed long before.

52
00:02:10.165 --> 00:02:12.325
Then some of us,

53
00:02:12.325 --> 00:02:16.165
not all of the children of God,

54
00:02:16.165 --> 00:02:18.425
came into the physical dimension,

55
00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:20.665
gradually made a transition,

56
00:02:20.665 --> 00:02:23.465
and Edgar explains it was like

57
00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:26.225
the crystallization of thought.

58
00:02:26.225 --> 00:02:28.685
Thought took on thought form,

59
00:02:28.685 --> 00:02:31.845
and we manifested into the form.

60
00:02:31.845 --> 00:02:33.885
And like Carl Jung talks about,

61
00:02:33.885 --> 00:02:36.065
at some point, we only projected

62
00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:38.585
a portion of our whole being,

63
00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:40.125
and so behind the veil,

64
00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:42.765
we have to get in touch with the other portion of us

65
00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:45.225
if we want full consciousness.

66
00:02:45.225 --> 00:02:46.405
<v Voiceover>And that's been true</v>

67
00:02:46.405 --> 00:02:48.045
really from the beginning of our--

68
00:02:48.045 --> 00:02:50.825
in our physical flesh incarnations

69
00:02:50.825 --> 00:02:52.265
as we've never--

70
00:02:52.265 --> 00:02:54.565
well, some, some people have been

71
00:02:54.565 --> 00:02:58.145
able to connect with and bring through their full being.

72
00:02:58.145 --> 00:02:58.945
<v ->Yes.</v>

73
00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:00.085
<v Voiceover>But not most.</v>

74
00:03:00.085 --> 00:03:00.645
<v ->Right.</v>

75
00:03:00.645 --> 00:03:01.885
<v Voiceover>And so let's talk</v>

76
00:03:01.885 --> 00:03:03.905
about what happened then

77
00:03:03.905 --> 00:03:05.145
through the early stages

78
00:03:05.145 --> 00:03:08.205
of the development of the human society consciousness,

79
00:03:08.205 --> 00:03:11.445
maybe starting with Mu or Lemuria.

80
00:03:11.445 --> 00:03:12.805
<v ->Uh-huh.</v>

81
00:03:12.805 --> 00:03:17.325
Well, on the descent out of spirit in to matter,

82
00:03:17.325 --> 00:03:20.645
or out of pure energy in to matter,

83
00:03:20.645 --> 00:03:23.965
we had great awareness

84
00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:27.205
of the forces of nature and the cosmos,

85
00:03:27.205 --> 00:03:30.425
and so that's why, when you look around our planet,

86
00:03:30.425 --> 00:03:32.865
you see all these megalithic structures

87
00:03:32.865 --> 00:03:36.945
of such sophisticated construction and engineering

88
00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:40.925
and oriented towards celestial events.

89
00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:43.105
What were these primitives doing?

90
00:03:43.105 --> 00:03:44.285
I mean, according to evolution,

91
00:03:44.285 --> 00:03:45.945
they should be planting corn,

92
00:03:45.945 --> 00:03:48.785
and they're out there building megalithic structures

93
00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:52.725
oriented to celestial objects and events

94
00:03:52.725 --> 00:03:56.345
and important cycles.

95
00:03:56.345 --> 00:03:57.845
This, according to Cayce,

96
00:03:57.845 --> 00:04:00.345
was a period in which great wisdom

97
00:04:00.345 --> 00:04:03.825
and high cultural sophistication occurred.

98
00:04:03.825 --> 00:04:06.885
However, he says we weren't as dense

99
00:04:06.885 --> 00:04:09.365
in matter as we are now,

100
00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:12.645
so it might be tricky finding bones of us.

101
00:04:12.645 --> 00:04:14.245
<v Voiceover>Mm-hm, good point.</v>

102
00:04:14.245 --> 00:04:15.645
<v ->When actually, yeah.</v>

103
00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:17.925
When actually there might be more of us

104
00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:20.025
in spirit, in subtle matter.

105
00:04:20.025 --> 00:04:22.925
In fact, Lemuria is believed

106
00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:25.845
to have gotten its name from lemur

107
00:04:25.845 --> 00:04:29.005
but not the little creature in Madagascar.

108
00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:31.885
Lemur also means ghost,

109
00:04:31.885 --> 00:04:33.965
and that was more likely our nature.

110
00:04:33.965 --> 00:04:36.345
We were like ghosts, spirits,

111
00:04:36.345 --> 00:04:37.905
but we were able to function,

112
00:04:37.905 --> 00:04:40.145
to move the forces of matter

113
00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:43.525
using cosmic energies and all.

114
00:04:43.525 --> 00:04:45.445
And we could move stones

115
00:04:45.445 --> 00:04:47.425
that weighed 70 tons

116
00:04:47.425 --> 00:04:49.845
to build the Great Pyramid's King's Chamber

117
00:04:49.845 --> 00:04:53.205
or other structures.

118
00:04:53.205 --> 00:04:57.465
The Obelisk of Hapshetsut in Karnak

119
00:04:57.465 --> 00:05:00.765
is still an engineering marvel.

120
00:05:00.765 --> 00:05:02.165
How could they even raise it?

121
00:05:02.165 --> 00:05:04.505
It weighs so much and is so tall,

122
00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:07.365
it would break if you tried to just raise it.

123
00:05:07.365 --> 00:05:09.665
How could all of this occur?

124
00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:12.845
We understood those forces back then.

125
00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:15.085
The deeper you moved into matter,

126
00:05:15.085 --> 00:05:18.865
the more you lost awareness of the cosmic dynamics

127
00:05:18.865 --> 00:05:23.865
and your connection or harmony with nature forces.

128
00:05:23.885 --> 00:05:25.865
And then you became more physical,

129
00:05:25.865 --> 00:05:28.945
and these things became very difficult to build.

130
00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:32.425
<v Voiceover>You've been featured on "Ancient Aliens"</v>

131
00:05:32.425 --> 00:05:34.305
because you understand the Cayce readings

132
00:05:34.305 --> 00:05:37.125
in a lot of very complex manners,

133
00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:40.302
and this might be a good place to ask you,

134
00:05:40.302 --> 00:05:44.082
often times these various feats

135
00:05:44.082 --> 00:05:46.642
that would have required other technologies

136
00:05:46.642 --> 00:05:48.522
and understanding of cosmic forces

137
00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:51.182
and the movement of energy that were emloyed

138
00:05:51.182 --> 00:05:53.302
for feats as what you just spoke of

139
00:05:53.302 --> 00:05:55.771
are attributed to visiting,

140
00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:58.771
third-dimensional alien species.

141
00:05:58.771 --> 00:05:59.711
<v ->Mm-hm.</v>

142
00:05:59.711 --> 00:06:00.891
<v Voiceover>Now where does what your saying</v>

143
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:02.311
dovetail with some of that?

144
00:06:02.311 --> 00:06:06.551
<v ->Well, fortunately, Zecharia Sitchin and I</v>

145
00:06:06.551 --> 00:06:08.931
had many conversations about aliens.

146
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:09.871
<v Voiceover>Oh, you did?</v>

147
00:06:09.871 --> 00:06:10.411
<v ->Oh, yeah.</v>

148
00:06:10.411 --> 00:06:11.631
<v Voiceover>Oh, you got into it with him.</v>

149
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:13.091
<v ->Yeah, well, we had a good fortune</v>

150
00:06:13.091 --> 00:06:14.771
to share a lot of our thoughts,

151
00:06:14.771 --> 00:06:17.731
and he really appreciated Edgar's perspective

152
00:06:17.731 --> 00:06:19.990
and also Edgar's timing,

153
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.771
which is often more ancient than most archaeologists--

154
00:06:22.771 --> 00:06:23.211
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

155
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:24.311
<v ->would accept.</v>

156
00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:27.411
The key perspective from Cayce

157
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:31.431
is definitely there are aliens to this planet.

158
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:33.110
He even gave a little reading

159
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.191
for a Mayan princess who had reincarnated

160
00:06:36.191 --> 00:06:38.811
and said that she was in the Mayan lands

161
00:06:38.811 --> 00:06:41.031
when this planet was being visited

162
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:44.211
from other worlds, other planets.

163
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:46.171
They do exist.

164
00:06:46.171 --> 00:06:48.610
However, the factor we miss often

165
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.011
is that we were those aliens.

166
00:06:53.011 --> 00:06:53.831
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

167
00:06:53.831 --> 00:06:54.500
Yes.

168
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.060
Now there are others--

169
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.379
<v Voiceover>And that's a very important point.</v>

170
00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:57.620
<v ->Very important point.</v>

171
00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.339
(both laugh)

172
00:06:58.339 --> 00:06:59.920
<v Voiceover>There's no one native to this planet.</v>

173
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.220
<v ->Right, right.</v>

174
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.280
(both laugh)

175
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.080
That is very true.

176
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.999
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

177
00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:06.700
Okay, so we are very--

178
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.259
and my understanding also

179
00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:10.820
is, depending on the individiual

180
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.760
that's sitting in front of you,

181
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.020
you could have had your origins

182
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.760
in many different ways.

183
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.359
<v ->Yes.</v>

184
00:07:16.359 --> 00:07:18.400
<v Voiceover>And be here and now human.</v>

185
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.840
We're all kind of in the same dilemma now.

186
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.400
<v ->Right.</v>

187
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.460
<v Voiceover>Encased in this body,</v>

188
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.059
trying to figure out where we came from,

189
00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:23.760
what we're doing here,

190
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.019
and how to get back.

191
00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:25.400
<v ->Right.</v>

192
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.100
Exactly.

193
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.579
In fact, Edgar Cayce would sometimes

194
00:07:28.579 --> 00:07:30.520
start one of his psychic readings

195
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.820
by saying, "Oh, a Uranian, how refreshing."

196
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.640
<v Voiceover>(laughs)</v>

197
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.439
<v ->And the lady would say,</v>

198
00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:37.900
"No, I was from New Jersey."

199
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.220
(both laugh)

200
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.940
No, your soul was from way out there.

201
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.460
<v Voiceover>Well, let me ask you that.</v>

202
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.660
I mean, this is a little,

203
00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.779
we're going off the track just a bit,

204
00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:49.040
but not really.

205
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.599
What kind of influences was he seeing in individuals

206
00:07:52.599 --> 00:07:54.500
in terms of various kind of star seed

207
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.740
or planetary sourcing, so to speak.

208
00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.700
<v ->The uniqueness of Edgar Cayce</v>

209
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.359
was that he didn't just focus on reincarnation

210
00:08:03.359 --> 00:08:05.099
and previous lives.

211
00:08:05.099 --> 00:08:05.400
<v Voiceover>Mm-hm.</v>

212
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.880
<v ->He focused on what he called sojourns in other realms.</v>

213
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.680
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

214
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.239
<v ->When we're not here,</v>

215
00:08:11.239 --> 00:08:15.440
it's not like we're in stasis or some suspended state.

216
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.979
We're active elsewhere in the cosmos.

217
00:08:18.979 --> 00:08:21.440
We're children of the celestial realms,

218
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.640
and so we can be very active.

219
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.020
So for him, he could sense

220
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.980
that you were going through the stargate of Arcturus.

221
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:30.960
And you would say,

222
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.320
"But, no, I was in bed in my home last night."

223
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.059
And he would say, "No, your soul was free

224
00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:36.360
and doing this."

225
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.159
But when death occurs, you also can do that

226
00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.038
and have experiences elsewhere.

227
00:08:42.038 --> 00:08:44.699
Prior to coming here, you've had experiences

228
00:08:44.699 --> 00:08:46.438
all over the universe.

229
00:08:46.438 --> 00:08:48.619
You're part of the infinite,

230
00:08:48.619 --> 00:08:50.958
but now you're finitely expressed,

231
00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.719
but that infinite influence is still with you,

232
00:08:53.719 --> 00:08:55.298
and Edgar saw that.

233
00:08:55.298 --> 00:08:56.998
<v Voiceover>And that becomes very confusing</v>

234
00:08:56.998 --> 00:08:58.939
to people who are readers

235
00:08:58.939 --> 00:09:00.339
who don't understand this,

236
00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:03.679
who are reading for other individuals intuitively,

237
00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:06.577
and they often times will go off on tangents

238
00:09:06.577 --> 00:09:08.696
because, oh goodness, I see you

239
00:09:08.696 --> 00:09:10.917
from this other planetary system.

240
00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:11.376
<v ->Mm-hm.</v>

241
00:09:11.376 --> 00:09:12.637
<v Voiceover>That could be between lives</v>

242
00:09:12.637 --> 00:09:14.217
prior to the existence on Earth,

243
00:09:14.217 --> 00:09:16.036
dream time, or anything?

244
00:09:16.036 --> 00:09:16.956
<v ->Yes.</v>

245
00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:17.577
Exactly.

246
00:09:17.577 --> 00:09:18.376
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

247
00:09:18.376 --> 00:09:19.317
<v ->Exactly.</v>

248
00:09:19.317 --> 00:09:22.577
In fact, Cayce would say not everything is karma

249
00:09:22.577 --> 00:09:24.617
from a previous life.

250
00:09:24.617 --> 00:09:27.176
A lot of what you have in your energetics

251
00:09:27.176 --> 00:09:31.636
and your urges and dynamics are celestial experiences

252
00:09:31.636 --> 00:09:33.557
that influence you,

253
00:09:33.557 --> 00:09:34.757
and that's why he thought,

254
00:09:34.757 --> 00:09:37.276
like Carl Jung, the depth psychologist, thought,

255
00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:41.777
that astronomical dynamics were important

256
00:09:41.777 --> 00:09:44.317
to an individual because,

257
00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:46.696
not because of where the star was when they were born,

258
00:09:46.696 --> 00:09:48.697
but because the individual experienced

259
00:09:48.697 --> 00:09:50.936
that planet dimension.

260
00:09:50.936 --> 00:09:51.457
<v Voiceover>Mm-hm.</v>

261
00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:53.577
<v ->Or that star constellation,</v>

262
00:09:53.577 --> 00:09:55.556
which we call the sign,

263
00:09:55.556 --> 00:09:57.797
and all of these things actually came

264
00:09:57.797 --> 00:09:59.417
from the Pleiades or something

265
00:09:59.417 --> 00:10:01.657
and had that experience within them

266
00:10:01.657 --> 00:10:03.537
now incarnate.

267
00:10:03.537 --> 00:10:05.476
So not everything was past life.

268
00:10:05.476 --> 00:10:09.477
It could be what you did in these sojourns elsewhere.

269
00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.345
<v Voiceover>Well, when we're looking then</v>

270
00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:16.626
at our emergence or our evolution

271
00:10:16.626 --> 00:10:19.545
into and through the physical

272
00:10:19.545 --> 00:10:21.346
and these various other influences

273
00:10:21.346 --> 00:10:22.305
that have come along

274
00:10:22.305 --> 00:10:23.826
and always been with us on Earth,

275
00:10:23.826 --> 00:10:26.046
including other third-dimensional entities

276
00:10:26.046 --> 00:10:29.286
with spaceships that are advanced and sophisticated,

277
00:10:29.286 --> 00:10:31.326
there are a lot of different theories.

278
00:10:31.326 --> 00:10:33.446
If you go to the conspiracy community,

279
00:10:33.446 --> 00:10:35.886
you're going to hear that there are races

280
00:10:35.886 --> 00:10:37.846
from other planetary systems

281
00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:40.546
that sought to exploit the nature

282
00:10:40.546 --> 00:10:42.666
of our forgetfulness

283
00:10:42.666 --> 00:10:45.545
and keep human consciousness constricted.

284
00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:49.425
First of all, what are your thoughts on that?

285
00:10:51.765 --> 00:10:54.946
<v ->Aliens are not innately brilliant.</v>

286
00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:55.926
<v Voiceover>(laughs)</v>

287
00:10:55.926 --> 00:10:57.485
<v ->They are just like us.</v>

288
00:10:57.485 --> 00:10:58.046
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

289
00:10:58.046 --> 00:10:59.825
<v ->Some of us have got it together,</v>

290
00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:02.746
and some us are wacky, way-out lost.

291
00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:04.366
(both laugh)

292
00:11:04.366 --> 00:11:08.026
There's free will in all the entities in the whole cosmos,

293
00:11:08.026 --> 00:11:09.686
and you have to understand

294
00:11:09.686 --> 00:11:12.025
that, just because they're speaking

295
00:11:12.025 --> 00:11:13.346
from another dimension,

296
00:11:13.346 --> 00:11:16.227
doesn't mean they're that much brighter than you.

297
00:11:16.227 --> 00:11:16.758
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

298
00:11:16.758 --> 00:11:17.718
(both laugh)

299
00:11:17.718 --> 00:11:19.797
<v ->So caution is called for.</v>

300
00:11:19.797 --> 00:11:20.818
<v Voiceover>So, yes,</v>

301
00:11:20.818 --> 00:11:23.238
exploitation is certainly a possibility.

302
00:11:23.238 --> 00:11:23.637
<v ->Yes.</v>

303
00:11:23.637 --> 00:11:24.398
<v Voiceover>We do it to each other.</v>

304
00:11:24.398 --> 00:11:25.037
<v ->Oh yes.</v>

305
00:11:25.037 --> 00:11:25.678
<v Voiceover>We do it to other species.</v>

306
00:11:25.678 --> 00:11:27.158
Other species do it to us.

307
00:11:27.158 --> 00:11:27.518
<v ->Yes.</v>

308
00:11:27.518 --> 00:11:28.677
<v Voiceover>And have done it to us.</v>

309
00:11:28.677 --> 00:11:29.077
<v ->Yes.</v>

310
00:11:29.077 --> 00:11:30.677
<v Voiceover>And so we look at that,</v>

311
00:11:30.677 --> 00:11:34.018
and often times, a lot of energy has gone,

312
00:11:34.018 --> 00:11:36.638
in recent times, to trying to figure

313
00:11:36.638 --> 00:11:37.678
that piece out,

314
00:11:37.678 --> 00:11:39.018
and how do you resist and grow

315
00:11:39.018 --> 00:11:42.418
beyond the strangle hold other species may have

316
00:11:42.418 --> 00:11:44.884
over our developing consciousness.

317
00:11:44.884 --> 00:11:48.297
But in truth, there has to be a much more efficient way

318
00:11:48.297 --> 00:11:50.224
to move beyond any kind of challenge

319
00:11:50.224 --> 00:11:51.524
that could be out there

320
00:11:51.524 --> 00:11:54.164
because there are certainly plenty of the other assisting.

321
00:11:54.164 --> 00:11:56.524
Can you talk to us now about--

322
00:11:56.524 --> 00:11:58.144
let's go a little further into Atlantis,

323
00:11:58.144 --> 00:11:59.523
in through the Atlantean times,

324
00:11:59.523 --> 00:12:02.014
Egypt, and kind of emerging back

325
00:12:02.014 --> 00:12:03.824
with some of those forces and beyond.

326
00:12:03.824 --> 00:12:07.543
<v ->Well, interesting, as the Hopi legends hold,</v>

327
00:12:07.543 --> 00:12:09.464
the door to the other dimensions

328
00:12:09.464 --> 00:12:11.644
was open in the ancient times.

329
00:12:11.644 --> 00:12:13.664
You could come and go.

330
00:12:13.664 --> 00:12:15.064
Unlike the way it is today

331
00:12:15.064 --> 00:12:18.323
where you are sealed into this physical vehicle.

332
00:12:18.323 --> 00:12:21.544
Once your soft spots seal over in your baby body,

333
00:12:21.544 --> 00:12:24.184
you're encased for an incarnation.

334
00:12:24.184 --> 00:12:26.383
According to these ancient legends,

335
00:12:26.383 --> 00:12:29.224
that was not the case in ancient times.

336
00:12:29.224 --> 00:12:32.424
So you could manifest here

337
00:12:32.424 --> 00:12:34.963
and sojourn and be active and dynamic,

338
00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:37.823
meet others, develop relationships with them,

339
00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:40.524
but you could also withdraw.

340
00:12:40.524 --> 00:12:41.944
Edgar used the phrase

341
00:12:41.944 --> 00:12:44.343
for an Atlantean priestess one time.

342
00:12:44.343 --> 00:12:46.004
He said she withdrew

343
00:12:46.004 --> 00:12:48.383
to the deeper meditations in Jupiter.

344
00:12:48.383 --> 00:12:48.884
<v Voiceover>Mm-hm.</v>

345
00:12:48.884 --> 00:12:50.104
<v ->And everybody went, "What?"</v>

346
00:12:50.104 --> 00:12:50.924
(both laugh)

347
00:12:50.924 --> 00:12:51.624
<v Voiceover>What's that mean?</v>

348
00:12:51.624 --> 00:12:52.264
(both laugh)

349
00:12:52.264 --> 00:12:52.883
I get it.

350
00:12:52.883 --> 00:12:53.243
<v ->Yeah.</v>

351
00:12:53.243 --> 00:12:55.863
But that's what you could do in those days.

352
00:12:55.863 --> 00:12:57.044
It's different now.

353
00:12:57.044 --> 00:12:58.864
We've come very deep into matter.

354
00:12:58.864 --> 00:13:00.744
We are really encased in matter,

355
00:13:00.744 --> 00:13:04.104
and it requires a lot of practice and development

356
00:13:04.104 --> 00:13:07.223
and soul growth and mental expansion

357
00:13:07.223 --> 00:13:11.584
in order to feel the true self free of matter.

358
00:13:11.584 --> 00:13:12.424
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

359
00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:16.223
<v ->But even the Hopi legend says the door was closed.</v>

360
00:13:16.223 --> 00:13:19.303
So now it's even harder to do.

361
00:13:19.303 --> 00:13:20.582
But that's gonna change.

362
00:13:20.582 --> 00:13:22.202
The new age that's coming

363
00:13:22.202 --> 00:13:26.443
is an age of release of the bondage of matter

364
00:13:26.443 --> 00:13:30.043
and physicality and self-consciousness

365
00:13:30.043 --> 00:13:33.603
into more luminescence, expanse of consciousness,

366
00:13:33.603 --> 00:13:35.783
and Edgar actually says

367
00:13:35.783 --> 00:13:38.963
the people of the earth are going to meet

368
00:13:38.963 --> 00:13:40.562
the people of the universe.

369
00:13:40.562 --> 00:13:41.563
<v Voiceover>Mm-hm.</v>

370
00:13:41.563 --> 00:13:42.563
<v ->Now that's interesting</v>

371
00:13:42.563 --> 00:13:44.222
because I thought we were the only ones around.

372
00:13:44.222 --> 00:13:45.223
(both laugh)

373
00:13:45.223 --> 00:13:46.163
<v Voiceover>No.</v>

374
00:13:46.163 --> 00:13:46.983
<v ->No.</v>

375
00:13:46.983 --> 00:13:49.343
<v Voiceover>Okay, so,</v>

376
00:13:49.343 --> 00:13:51.043
in the Cayce readings,

377
00:13:51.043 --> 00:13:52.783
as we go through this period

378
00:13:52.783 --> 00:13:54.563
where we were much more expanded

379
00:13:54.563 --> 00:13:57.963
and still had the ability to come and go, so to speak,

380
00:13:57.963 --> 00:14:00.743
there were these cycles that happened,

381
00:14:00.743 --> 00:14:03.462
these cycle of greed, of corruption, of destruction;

382
00:14:03.462 --> 00:14:05.783
some of it natural, some of it not natural,

383
00:14:05.783 --> 00:14:06.923
and I think he--

384
00:14:06.923 --> 00:14:07.983
tell me if I'm wrong on this--

385
00:14:07.983 --> 00:14:10.242
did he say that the Atlantean cultures

386
00:14:10.242 --> 00:14:14.283
were reconstructed and then fell three times?

387
00:14:14.283 --> 00:14:15.323
<v ->Yeah.</v>

388
00:14:15.323 --> 00:14:16.303
You're exactly right.

389
00:14:16.303 --> 00:14:19.343
Edgar Cayce's story of Atlantis

390
00:14:19.343 --> 00:14:23.943
is a story of high, marvelous, idealistic culture

391
00:14:23.943 --> 00:14:27.602
around 200,000 B.C.

392
00:14:27.602 --> 00:14:32.263
But gradually, reaching closer to 50,000 B.C.,

393
00:14:32.263 --> 00:14:34.233
it lost its way.

394
00:14:34.233 --> 00:14:37.829
It became more violent, more self-centered,

395
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:39.569
more aggressive,

396
00:14:39.569 --> 00:14:41.549
more dense into matter,

397
00:14:41.549 --> 00:14:44.349
and their beautiful crystal that they had used

398
00:14:44.349 --> 00:14:46.169
for healing and rejuvenation

399
00:14:46.169 --> 00:14:48.689
became the death ray.

400
00:14:48.689 --> 00:14:51.809
They started to use it to kill, to destroy

401
00:14:51.809 --> 00:14:55.269
instead of all the healing and the illumination.

402
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:57.920
Edgar said they could touch the crystal

403
00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.269
and their minds could expand

404
00:14:59.269 --> 00:15:01.809
into the collective conscious, the universal.

405
00:15:01.809 --> 00:15:04.549
They could put their bodies near the radiation

406
00:15:04.549 --> 00:15:06.549
of the crystal that was being channeled

407
00:15:06.549 --> 00:15:08.949
and rejuvenate the cells of their body,

408
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:13.589
but eventually, as they deteriorated in their awareness,

409
00:15:13.589 --> 00:15:16.069
they began to use the radiation

410
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:17.369
coming through the crystal

411
00:15:17.369 --> 00:15:20.589
to actually destroy things.

412
00:15:20.589 --> 00:15:21.849
<v Voiceover>Was this more having to do</v>

413
00:15:21.849 --> 00:15:24.149
with competition, military, commerce,

414
00:15:24.149 --> 00:15:26.529
domination of land mass?

415
00:15:26.529 --> 00:15:27.409
<v ->Exactly.</v>

416
00:15:27.409 --> 00:15:31.769
It had more to do with this development

417
00:15:31.769 --> 00:15:34.589
of we and them

418
00:15:34.589 --> 00:15:36.569
when all was actually one.

419
00:15:36.569 --> 00:15:40.189
The development of mine and yours,

420
00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:42.989
and mine is always bigger than yours,

421
00:15:42.989 --> 00:15:46.669
and that energy started to distort

422
00:15:46.669 --> 00:15:50.969
their awareness of this harmonic oneness.

423
00:15:50.969 --> 00:15:53.549
And they became more individualized,

424
00:15:53.549 --> 00:15:56.049
and in that case, they could turn others

425
00:15:56.049 --> 00:15:57.569
into the enemy,

426
00:15:57.569 --> 00:16:00.929
and destroying them was just what you did

427
00:16:00.929 --> 00:16:01.589
because their--

428
00:16:01.589 --> 00:16:02.509
<v Voiceover>You justified it.</v>

429
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:04.069
<v ->You justified it, right.</v>

430
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:05.289
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

431
00:16:05.289 --> 00:16:07.469
I really should have asked you

432
00:16:07.469 --> 00:16:08.629
one other thing prior to this,

433
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:10.109
but it's not a bad time to ask,

434
00:16:10.109 --> 00:16:11.109
and that is,

435
00:16:11.109 --> 00:16:12.809
okay, as we look at what was happening

436
00:16:12.809 --> 00:16:15.109
to the psyche of humankind during Atlantis,

437
00:16:15.109 --> 00:16:17.529
what happened with Lemuria

438
00:16:17.529 --> 00:16:18.969
toward the end of Lemuria?

439
00:16:18.969 --> 00:16:19.649
Because my understanding

440
00:16:19.649 --> 00:16:21.669
is it actually bridged over into the Atlantean period.

441
00:16:21.669 --> 00:16:23.669
<v ->Yeah, you're correct.</v>

442
00:16:23.669 --> 00:16:26.889
In the Cayce model, or story,

443
00:16:26.889 --> 00:16:31.409
Lemuria, or Mu, was the most ancient location

444
00:16:31.409 --> 00:16:34.549
of the first contact on this planet,

445
00:16:34.549 --> 00:16:35.989
and the culture developed there,

446
00:16:35.989 --> 00:16:38.649
and it was high-level culture.

447
00:16:38.649 --> 00:16:40.909
But we were more like spirits.

448
00:16:40.909 --> 00:16:42.829
We weren't real physical beings,

449
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:46.369
more like ghosts or spirits.

450
00:16:46.369 --> 00:16:49.089
Atlantis developed a long time later.

451
00:16:49.089 --> 00:16:51.549
Lemuria went on for, according to Cayce,

452
00:16:51.549 --> 00:16:52.769
millions of years.

453
00:16:52.769 --> 00:16:53.929
<v Voiceover>Yes, many millions, yes.</v>

454
00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:54.369
<v ->Yeah.</v>

455
00:16:54.369 --> 00:16:57.289
But Atlantis, only a few hundred thousand years.

456
00:16:57.289 --> 00:17:01.249
But Atlantis developed to develop a physical vehicle.

457
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:04.709
Now the Mayans tell the story this way:

458
00:17:04.709 --> 00:17:06.849
The children of God withdrew

459
00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:10.609
into the seven caves to powwow with Mother God

460
00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:13.009
as to the situation they had gotten into.

461
00:17:13.009 --> 00:17:14.989
And they told her, we're in trouble here.

462
00:17:14.989 --> 00:17:18.949
And she said, "You need a perfect vehicle,

463
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:20.649
a perfect form."

464
00:17:20.649 --> 00:17:22.749
<v Voiceover>And this is in Lemurian times still?</v>

465
00:17:22.749 --> 00:17:23.329
<v ->Yes.</v>

466
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.769
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

467
00:17:23.769 --> 00:17:24.549
<v ->Still in Lemurians times.</v>

468
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:25.209
<v Voiceover>Yes, yes.</v>

469
00:17:25.209 --> 00:17:25.889
I get that.

470
00:17:25.889 --> 00:17:28.029
<v ->But the Atlantean development of the perfect body</v>

471
00:17:28.029 --> 00:17:31.769
was what the Mayans called the Blue Maize People,

472
00:17:31.769 --> 00:17:33.849
perfect in every way.

473
00:17:33.849 --> 00:17:36.789
And that was the first physical vehicle

474
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:41.769
that was ideally arranged for the children of God to use

475
00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:45.949
rather than the various animals and plant kingdom,

476
00:17:45.949 --> 00:17:48.029
they used their material forms,

477
00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:49.509
but there was no material form

478
00:17:49.509 --> 00:17:52.149
for these children of God,

479
00:17:52.149 --> 00:17:53.809
these spirits of the creator.

480
00:17:53.809 --> 00:17:57.405
They required a different arrangement,

481
00:17:57.405 --> 00:17:59.365
but the creator, according to Cayce,

482
00:17:59.365 --> 00:18:00.725
never thought they'd even want to come

483
00:18:00.725 --> 00:18:02.305
to this mundane world. (laughs)

484
00:18:02.305 --> 00:18:02.885
<v Voiceover>Mm-hm.</v>

485
00:18:02.885 --> 00:18:04.105
There was some confusion there.

486
00:18:04.105 --> 00:18:04.585
<v ->Yeah.</v>

487
00:18:04.585 --> 00:18:06.065
<v Voiceover>This was an interesting experiment.</v>

488
00:18:06.065 --> 00:18:07.285
<v ->Right.</v>

489
00:18:07.285 --> 00:18:08.825
But when it became evident

490
00:18:08.825 --> 00:18:10.505
they wanted to come here,

491
00:18:10.505 --> 00:18:12.205
a form had to be made for them

492
00:18:12.205 --> 00:18:14.525
to manifest three dimensionally.

493
00:18:14.525 --> 00:18:17.285
And that was in the legend of the Maya,

494
00:18:17.285 --> 00:18:18.905
the Blue Maize People.

495
00:18:18.905 --> 00:18:19.765
<v Voiceover>Very interesting.</v>

496
00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:20.985
<v ->Perfect in every way.</v>

497
00:18:20.985 --> 00:18:23.145
<v Voiceover>I had an experience years ago</v>

498
00:18:23.145 --> 00:18:25.345
where I was taken into a far memory

499
00:18:25.345 --> 00:18:26.345
that shocked me

500
00:18:26.345 --> 00:18:28.765
where I was a young male

501
00:18:28.765 --> 00:18:30.945
and it was a time before eyesight had developed

502
00:18:30.945 --> 00:18:33.365
fully, full-spectrum of color.

503
00:18:33.365 --> 00:18:34.445
I didn't have full-spectrum;

504
00:18:34.445 --> 00:18:35.885
everything was beige and brown.

505
00:18:35.885 --> 00:18:38.085
The only color there was a little bit of purple,

506
00:18:38.085 --> 00:18:39.925
and that was in the large bird,

507
00:18:39.925 --> 00:18:41.745
much larger than a condor.

508
00:18:41.745 --> 00:18:43.685
And I used to, for kicks,

509
00:18:43.685 --> 00:18:45.105
set my body down

510
00:18:45.105 --> 00:18:46.945
and then get out of the body

511
00:18:46.945 --> 00:18:48.225
and go with the bird,

512
00:18:48.225 --> 00:18:51.745
and, with permission, we'd fly around together.

513
00:18:51.745 --> 00:18:52.885
And you could see other birds

514
00:18:52.885 --> 00:18:55.245
who were being occupied in the same way.

515
00:18:55.245 --> 00:18:58.025
And then come back.

516
00:18:58.025 --> 00:18:59.965
The thing about going in to far memory

517
00:18:59.965 --> 00:19:01.685
is sometimes you don't exactly know

518
00:19:01.685 --> 00:19:02.625
where you were.

519
00:19:02.625 --> 00:19:03.125
<v ->Uh-huh.</v>

520
00:19:03.125 --> 00:19:04.005
<v Voiceover>I've always guessed</v>

521
00:19:04.005 --> 00:19:05.725
it was probably Lemurian times.

522
00:19:05.725 --> 00:19:06.505
<v ->Right.</v>

523
00:19:06.505 --> 00:19:07.765
<v Voiceover>Which would that have been</v>

524
00:19:07.765 --> 00:19:10.725
when this kind of thing was possible for us to do?

525
00:19:10.725 --> 00:19:11.505
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

526
00:19:11.505 --> 00:19:12.425
That's what Cayce said.

527
00:19:12.425 --> 00:19:12.925
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

528
00:19:12.925 --> 00:19:15.505
<v ->The spirits, having no physical vehicle,</v>

529
00:19:15.505 --> 00:19:17.685
would move their essence

530
00:19:17.685 --> 00:19:19.225
and their sensory perception

531
00:19:19.225 --> 00:19:22.985
into an existing physical form in this dimension,

532
00:19:22.985 --> 00:19:25.005
such as a bird,

533
00:19:25.005 --> 00:19:27.105
such as half-horse, half-man,

534
00:19:27.105 --> 00:19:29.045
you know, all of these sort of creatures

535
00:19:29.045 --> 00:19:30.905
in our mythology

536
00:19:30.905 --> 00:19:33.185
were this sort of merging,

537
00:19:33.185 --> 00:19:34.265
and that couldn't be

538
00:19:34.265 --> 00:19:36.385
because the arrangement was everything

539
00:19:36.385 --> 00:19:38.965
was supposed to give seed to itself,

540
00:19:38.965 --> 00:19:41.465
so we needed an ideal vehicle

541
00:19:41.465 --> 00:19:44.585
for these spirits to use

542
00:19:44.585 --> 00:19:46.325
rather than those that belonged

543
00:19:46.325 --> 00:19:47.945
to the felines or the canines.

544
00:19:47.945 --> 00:19:48.545
<v Voiceover>To others.</v>

545
00:19:48.545 --> 00:19:49.385
<v ->Yeah, you're not supposed to--</v>

546
00:19:49.385 --> 00:19:49.965
<v Voiceover>That's rude.</v>

547
00:19:49.965 --> 00:19:51.385
You're not supposed to be riding in them,

548
00:19:51.385 --> 00:19:52.345
but it was fun.

549
00:19:52.345 --> 00:19:53.245
(both laugh)

550
00:19:53.245 --> 00:19:53.985
<v ->Right, right.</v>

551
00:19:53.985 --> 00:19:55.085
<v Voiceover>Just for brief periods.</v>

552
00:19:55.085 --> 00:19:56.445
No harm done. (laughs)

553
00:19:56.445 --> 00:19:57.045
<v ->Uh-huh.</v>

554
00:19:57.045 --> 00:19:57.765
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

555
00:19:57.765 --> 00:19:59.285
Okay, so now we go back through

556
00:19:59.285 --> 00:20:00.245
the Atlantean period.

557
00:20:00.245 --> 00:20:01.805
We see the evolution of consciousness

558
00:20:01.805 --> 00:20:04.965
and selfishness, greed, me, you,

559
00:20:04.965 --> 00:20:07.945
and now we're starting to get into territory

560
00:20:07.945 --> 00:20:09.565
that feels more familiar to us.

561
00:20:09.565 --> 00:20:12.185
So let's talk about the migration then

562
00:20:12.185 --> 00:20:14.865
after the Atlantean period into Egypt,

563
00:20:14.865 --> 00:20:18.265
and what was really trying to be redeemed

564
00:20:18.265 --> 00:20:19.605
during that period.

565
00:20:19.605 --> 00:20:21.945
We always think of Egypt as bringing great darkness,

566
00:20:21.945 --> 00:20:23.745
but there were beautiful light cycles there.

567
00:20:23.745 --> 00:20:24.745
<v ->Oh, yeah.</v>

568
00:20:24.745 --> 00:20:27.245
One of the key transitions

569
00:20:27.245 --> 00:20:32.005
occurred in Atlantis in 106,000 B.C.

570
00:20:32.005 --> 00:20:36.685
And it was the desire to manifest

571
00:20:36.685 --> 00:20:40.925
the yin and yang in individual forms

572
00:20:40.925 --> 00:20:45.823
instead of a hermaphroditic, singular form.

573
00:20:45.823 --> 00:20:48.883
And Edgar Cayce's readings tell us

574
00:20:48.883 --> 00:20:53.523
the story that the yin was separated out

575
00:20:53.523 --> 00:20:56.383
and given a form that reflected the yin,

576
00:20:56.383 --> 00:20:58.343
and therefore, a woman's body,

577
00:20:58.343 --> 00:21:00.463
everything is internalized.

578
00:21:00.463 --> 00:21:03.143
She is within the cycles of the moon,

579
00:21:03.143 --> 00:21:05.683
she conceives within herself,

580
00:21:05.683 --> 00:21:08.803
she gestates in the hidden place of her womb,

581
00:21:08.803 --> 00:21:12.063
the child grows, life is in there, it comes out,

582
00:21:12.063 --> 00:21:15.643
then she brings forth nourishment from within.

583
00:21:15.643 --> 00:21:17.003
All this is the yin.

584
00:21:17.003 --> 00:21:20.083
The male form, the yang form, was projected,

585
00:21:20.083 --> 00:21:21.423
with the phallus,

586
00:21:21.423 --> 00:21:23.463
the idea of he's the sword carrier,

587
00:21:23.463 --> 00:21:24.863
the plower of the field,

588
00:21:24.863 --> 00:21:28.143
and all of this dynamic externalized energy.

589
00:21:28.143 --> 00:21:29.783
These were the yin and yang

590
00:21:29.783 --> 00:21:32.827
separated into individual forms.

591
00:21:32.827 --> 00:21:34.403
At first, this was a good idea

592
00:21:34.403 --> 00:21:36.003
because, like in Genesis,

593
00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:38.803
the Lord said, "They are lonesome here."

594
00:21:38.803 --> 00:21:42.243
So He cast the deep sleep over the androgynous Adam

595
00:21:42.243 --> 00:21:44.303
and pulls out the feminine.

596
00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:45.763
And the Hebrew word used

597
00:21:45.763 --> 00:21:47.903
when they first pull her out is kava,

598
00:21:47.903 --> 00:21:49.883
which means the life giver,

599
00:21:49.883 --> 00:21:51.103
and that's, for all of us,

600
00:21:51.103 --> 00:21:54.783
that's our intuitive, deep inner self.

601
00:21:54.783 --> 00:21:56.363
And it creates a separate form,

602
00:21:56.363 --> 00:21:58.583
and the two become help-meets to one another

603
00:21:58.583 --> 00:22:00.523
in this realm of duality

604
00:22:00.523 --> 00:22:03.343
and individual manifestation.

605
00:22:03.343 --> 00:22:07.383
It's lonesome to be encased in one individual form

606
00:22:07.383 --> 00:22:08.863
when you were collective.

607
00:22:08.863 --> 00:22:10.463
In Egypt, they called them

608
00:22:10.463 --> 00:22:13.183
the Daughters of Isis, the Sons of Rama

609
00:22:13.183 --> 00:22:14.643
because they flew together.

610
00:22:14.643 --> 00:22:18.403
They were all one in a big, harmonious collective.

611
00:22:18.403 --> 00:22:21.563
But now you're individualized all by yourself in here.

612
00:22:21.563 --> 00:22:24.023
So it was better to create companionship,

613
00:22:24.023 --> 00:22:25.443
and that was done.

614
00:22:25.443 --> 00:22:27.843
However, that became--

615
00:22:27.843 --> 00:22:28.683
<v Voiceover>Things happen.</v>

616
00:22:28.683 --> 00:22:29.403
<v ->Yeah.</v>

617
00:22:29.403 --> 00:22:30.203
(both laugh)

618
00:22:30.203 --> 00:22:31.623
<v Voiceover>Marid happens.</v>

619
00:22:31.623 --> 00:22:32.643
<v ->Right.</v>

620
00:22:32.643 --> 00:22:33.563
That's right.

621
00:22:33.563 --> 00:22:34.543
(both laugh)

622
00:22:34.543 --> 00:22:35.883
A lot of problems develop,

623
00:22:35.883 --> 00:22:39.843
and Egypt comes along to correct all of these problems.

624
00:22:39.843 --> 00:22:41.423
And, according to Cayce,

625
00:22:41.423 --> 00:22:44.823
the temples sacrifice and the temple beautiful

626
00:22:44.823 --> 00:22:46.443
were two temples that were arranged

627
00:22:46.443 --> 00:22:48.563
to help clear up the problems.

628
00:22:48.563 --> 00:22:52.023
The temple of sacrifice was to purify the form

629
00:22:52.023 --> 00:22:56.243
of any thought forms or remaining essences

630
00:22:56.243 --> 00:23:00.183
of animal influences from pushing your spirit

631
00:23:00.183 --> 00:23:01.663
into animal forms

632
00:23:01.663 --> 00:23:04.563
before you had an individual human body.

633
00:23:04.563 --> 00:23:06.703
So they would cleanse the consciousnesses

634
00:23:06.703 --> 00:23:11.403
and the vibratory essence of the being to purify.

635
00:23:11.403 --> 00:23:13.866
Then, in the temple beautiful,

636
00:23:13.866 --> 00:23:16.550
they would accentuate the seven spiritual sinners,

637
00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:19.330
the shakras, the lotuses, and all this

638
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:23.770
to bring about a really good physical form

639
00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:28.450
that you could use to manifest your full soul abilities,

640
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.010
and those were the two temples

641
00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.970
and the way they worked it.

642
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:34.710
They also tried to set up a new ideal.

643
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:37.370
According to Cayce, there was no

644
00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:40.750
organic family at the time.

645
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:44.550
Families were collectives of multiple peoples,

646
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:47.270
and the Egyptians came up with the idea

647
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:52.270
of the genetic father

648
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:53.630
and the genetic mother

649
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.730
could stay together for the child

650
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:56.950
that they produced,

651
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.510
rather than putting it into the collective childcare

652
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:01.610
that was the normal process.

653
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:05.610
And so they began to create unique individual families

654
00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.190
of the man, the woman, and the offspring.

655
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.030
And that was unique in Egypt,

656
00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.430
but it actually worked well

657
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:13.690
because it made everybody feel

658
00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:17.310
more cared for personally,

659
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.070
and it developed a strength bond

660
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.050
we call family,

661
00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:22.650
and then all the people connected

662
00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.010
to that genetic thing were strong.

663
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:26.850
Whereas before, it was just a collection

664
00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:30.170
of multiple souls in a group.

665
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:31.930
And this helped a bit,

666
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.410
and so purifying the body,

667
00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:37.810
giving a sense of family

668
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:41.030
and the generations of family,

669
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.630
and all of this helped the souls

670
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.990
orient themselves better in this world.

671
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:48.110
<v Voiceover>And that was well depicted</v>

672
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:49.890
during Akhenaten's time,

673
00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:52.170
where they started showing the pharoah

674
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.070
and his wife and their children together,

675
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.310
which really hadn't been done,

676
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.870
and you don't see in previous hieroglyphics, do you?

677
00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:00.390
Is that kind of the beginning

678
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.450
of bringing that together,

679
00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:02.130
or am I mistaken?

680
00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:02.670
<v ->Not really.</v>

681
00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:03.630
You actually do see in previous ones.

682
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:04.370
<v Voiceover>Do you?</v>

683
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:04.950
<v ->Yeah.</v>

684
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:05.790
<v Voiceover>That's maybe just</v>

685
00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:06.630
the most well-known.

686
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:07.410
<v ->Oh, yes.</v>

687
00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:07.970
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

688
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:08.930
<v ->No question about it.</v>

689
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.890
And Nefertiti was the wife.

690
00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:12.610
I mean, Nefertiti, you know.

691
00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:15.670
Her bust is considered among, say,

692
00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.730
Tut's mask, the second is Nefertiti's bust.

693
00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:19.310
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

694
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:20.670
<v ->Of the greatest artifacts of Egypt.</v>

695
00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:21.430
<v Voiceover>But you're saying</v>

696
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.590
far prior to that in the Egyptian culture,

697
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.870
this family sense was developed,

698
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.670
and we don't see those depictions as easily now.

699
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:31.430
<v ->No, they're there.</v>

700
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.470
<v Voiceover>How far back do they go?</v>

701
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:35.090
<v ->Far back.</v>

702
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:36.030
<v Voiceover>Yeah, I wouldn't know.</v>

703
00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.710
<v ->You actually see the pharaoh and the queen</v>

704
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.690
and the children of the pharaoh and queen,

705
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.290
you actually see drawings, sculptures,

706
00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:46.950
carvings on the walls, papyruses.

707
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:50.150
<v Voiceover>And what are we looking at B.C.?</v>

708
00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:51.530
<v ->What do you mean?</v>

709
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:54.330
<v Voiceover>I mean how many millennia back?</v>

710
00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:54.990
<v ->For Egypt?</v>

711
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.570
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

712
00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:56.770
<v ->Oh, my gosh.</v>

713
00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:58.850
Here's where we get into difficulty.

714
00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:00.570
<v Voiceover>Everybody starts arguing over that.</v>

715
00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:01.230
<v ->Right.</v>

716
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:04.690
Archaeologically speaking, so far,

717
00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:06.690
when you're looking at bones only

718
00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:09.610
and stone stuff, you're talking

719
00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.410
about 2, 3,000 B.C.,

720
00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:14.270
but from Edgar Cayce's perspective,

721
00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.470
you're talking 11, 12,000 B.C.

722
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:21.550
He actually dates the Great Flood legend

723
00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:24.530
that cleansed the earth of the original nephilim

724
00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:28.250
and all the other creatures, half-horse, half-man,

725
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.350
half-fish, half-woman,

726
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.290
all of these mess that in Genesis Six,

727
00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.330
God says, I'm gonna start over,

728
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:37.570
I'm gonna cleanse the world.

729
00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:41.090
He dates that at 22,800 B.C.

730
00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:42.610
<v Voiceover>Okay.</v>

731
00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.750
<v ->Then he dates the re-peopling of the earth</v>

732
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:48.210
to around 12,000 B.C.,

733
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.870
and they were coming back in

734
00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.930
with new, intense purpose,

735
00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:57.490
an intense desire to get it right,

736
00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.370
and they started building temples

737
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:00.670
all around the planet.

738
00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:02.010
Many cultures started building.

739
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:02.590
<v Voiceover>Mm-hm.</v>

740
00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:03.670
South America, Central America, yeah.

741
00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:04.690
<v ->Right.</v>

742
00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:09.690
And Egypt was one of those major new efforts,

743
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:13.810
and everything was to idealize

744
00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:18.490
the human body as a great temple,

745
00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:22.130
and beauty was respected and honored.

746
00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.890
Health was honored, almost worshipped,

747
00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:27.130
to have a beautiful form

748
00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:29.250
and to give birth to beautiful forms

749
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:30.750
that weren't contaminated

750
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.860
was the ideal.

751
00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.630
And then they kept writing the story,

752
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.270
like in the Egyptian Book of the Dead,

753
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:38.090
they kept producing the story

754
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.490
that we were actually celestial beings,

755
00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:42.710
heavenly beings

756
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:45.430
with the Ka, the spirit,

757
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.010
the soul, the Ba,

758
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:48.890
and if those two were united,

759
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:53.550
the Akh, which literally was the star being,

760
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:56.150
and the Akh had a star body.

761
00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.450
That's how idealistic they had each of us.

762
00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:00.670
It was just amazing.

763
00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:01.470
And when you died,

764
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:03.850
they had all this transition you had to make

765
00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:06.570
to reawaken to all those influences,

766
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:09.870
to go through the levels of heaven to reconnect,

767
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.990
and when you brought your soul and your spirit together,

768
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.870
you awakened your akh, your star being,

769
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:18.730
and its star body, the kab.

770
00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:19.910
Star body.

771
00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:21.830
So they had a picture of us

772
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.390
that we've forgotten completely

773
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:24.270
because we're pretty sure

774
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:26.590
we got a personality and a physical body,

775
00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:27.990
and that's it.

776
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:29.470
Maybe you have a soul,

777
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.790
maybe it survives the death of the body,

778
00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:33.310
but pretty much, it's over.

779
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:34.870
(both laugh)

780
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:36.190
<v Voiceover>Okay, so we're looking closer</v>

781
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:37.650
to 12,000 years ago,

782
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.690
and Robert Schoch, for example,

783
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:41.650
talks about the watermarking

784
00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:44.330
along the side of some of the artifacts,

785
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:45.710
the Sphinx in particular,

786
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:48.910
at being at least 12,000 years old,

787
00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:50.490
meaning it's possible that could have been there

788
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.190
prior to that even.

789
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:53.210
Is that possible?

790
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:56.230
<v ->Even the most scientific archaeologists</v>

791
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:59.970
acknowledge that tropical rainfall

792
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:04.910
occurred in Egypt in 11 to 9,000 B.C.

793
00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.730
because of the way the trade winds blew

794
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:10.110
and brought the rains.

795
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:11.450
But they thought the Sphinx

796
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:12.810
was built much later,

797
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:14.910
but now, when you look at the erosion

798
00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:17.110
on the Sphinx's pit walls

799
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:18.650
and on the back of the Sphinx,

800
00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:21.190
you see water runoff erosion,

801
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:23.010
not wind erosion.

802
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:24.770
Well, that throws it back towards

803
00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:28.250
7, 9,000, maybe 11,000 B.C.

804
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:31.470
Then, down in the southern tips of Egypt

805
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.230
near the Sudan border,

806
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:36.050
they found Nabta Playa, Stonehenge.

807
00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:38.030
The Egyptian Stonehenge.

808
00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:41.430
And they're dating that around 4, 5,000 B.C.,

809
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:43.670
and they believe that culture existed

810
00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.790
long before they built that stone complex,

811
00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:50.710
and they might have been the carriers, orally,

812
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.590
of the Book of the Dead

813
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.730
because the Egyptians who first carved it

814
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.330
in the Pyramids in Saqqara

815
00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:00.530
said they got it from previous culture

816
00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.870
and that it was only an oral tradition

817
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:05.450
and they put it down in writing.

818
00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:07.150
And in it is the description

819
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:11.050
of how to die to be reborn.

820
00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:12.710
Reborn in other dimensions,

821
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:16.570
to ascend up into the realms of the godlings,

822
00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:18.570
of the great God,

823
00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:21.970
and to awaken your akh, your star being,

824
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.150
and be among the stars again.

825
00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:26.390
This fits with the Mayan's story

826
00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:29.330
that the great winged serpent God,

827
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:32.510
Q'uq'umatz of the K'iche Mayan,

828
00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:36.290
or Quetzalcoatl of the Aztecs,

829
00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:38.010
asked all the children of God

830
00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:40.010
to put their hearts into the sacred fire

831
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.890
to spread more light on the earth.

832
00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:44.770
When they did, they went to the edge of heaven,

833
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:47.450
looked down, all the stars came out,

834
00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:50.430
and each one of us is one of those stars.

835
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:52.730
The Egyptians believed the same thing.

836
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:55.130
That's why the ceilings of their tombs,

837
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:56.790
they're all painted with stars.

838
00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:01.610
We are star beings incarnating temporarily.

839
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:05.470
But there's a star out there that is us, a light.

840
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:06.510
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

841
00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.890
And my understanding is,

842
00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:09.610
and I haven't read this in Cayce's work,

843
00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:11.770
that there has been,

844
00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:14.390
and we see much evidence of it in other places,

845
00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:18.130
but there has been something left for us

846
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:19.470
underneath the Pyramids,

847
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.110
underneath the paws of the Sphinx,

848
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:24.050
that we're apparently--

849
00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:25.830
I mean, it's understood there's something under there,

850
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:27.210
we know that now.

851
00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:28.130
Did Cayce ever talk

852
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.530
about what has been left behind for us

853
00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.150
in either of those places?

854
00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:32.570
<v ->Yes.</v>

855
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:33.890
<v Voiceover>For our awakening now.</v>

856
00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:34.590
<v ->Yeah.</v>

857
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:39.570
Now, in Cayce's story of all of this,

858
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:43.190
once the Atlanteans realized they were losing,

859
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:45.850
that they had destroyed their continent,

860
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:49.590
that they now were destroying the remnant islands,

861
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:51.910
and the earthquakes and volcanoes

862
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:54.510
and even meteor showers were becoming

863
00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:56.530
greater than ever before,

864
00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.510
they knew they had to do something

865
00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:01.390
to record their story

866
00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:05.450
and what the original legend of human beings was.

867
00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:09.190
And they made three sets of stone tablets.

868
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:12.470
And they sent three priests out to hide them

869
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:14.990
in three locations on this planet.

870
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:18.270
And Edgar said all three will be found,

871
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:21.130
so eventually, we will find these stone tablets.

872
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:23.930
There are 32 stone tablets in each set.

873
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:27.350
One of the sets was put in the Yucatan area

874
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:29.090
of the Mayan lands.

875
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:30.170
<v Voiceover>Puuc Hills.</v>

876
00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:32.010
<v ->Yeah, yeah.</v>

877
00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:36.570
The other one was in a temple of Autlan in Atlantis,

878
00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:40.270
but that temple sunk, so it's underneath the water,

879
00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:42.270
and the third set was put

880
00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.690
off the right front paw of the Sphinx.

881
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:45.430
<v Voiceover>Of the Sphinx.</v>

882
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:46.470
<v ->In Egypt.</v>

883
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:48.710
And Edgar gives more details

884
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:50.210
and talks more about this,

885
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:54.030
but eventually, we will find these stone now

886
00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:56.110
with carved hieroglyphs.

887
00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:59.330
He says they are of the language of the Atlanteans,

888
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:00.350
but he says back then,

889
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:02.350
the Tower of Babel had not occurred,

890
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:05.930
so there was one language all around the planet.

891
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.450
But they will be able to be translated.

892
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:09.990
They will require a little work,

893
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:11.250
but once you translate it,

894
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:13.910
you will have the singular ancient language

895
00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:15.490
of the entire planet

896
00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.710
because everyone spoke the same language.

897
00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:19.550
He did, however, say the Atlanteans

898
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:20.750
had a slight dialect.

899
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:22.370
<v Voiceover>(laughs)</v>

900
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:24.910
So the Dead Sea scrolls were an appetizer?

901
00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:25.670
<v ->Yeah.</v>

902
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:26.390
<v Voiceover>(laughs)</v>

903
00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:29.210
<v ->Let's hope it doesn't take as long to translate these</v>

904
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:31.190
as it did the Dead Sea scrolls.

905
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:32.790
<v Voiceover>Well let's hope we're all on the same page</v>

906
00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:35.070
and want to see the information come forth,

907
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:38.150
at least our consciousness has at least evolved that far

908
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:39.350
by the time we find them.

909
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.970
<v ->Right.</v>

910
00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:41.630
<v Voiceover>So that's something for us all</v>

911
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:42.590
to look forward to.

912
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:43.330
<v ->Yes.</v>

913
00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:44.490
<v Voiceover>In this life or another,</v>

914
00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:45.370
we'll find it.

915
00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:46.070
<v ->And do you know</v>

916
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:47.950
the archaeologist,

917
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:50.310
the real scientific archaelolgists

918
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.990
believe there are hidden records

919
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:53.490
on the Gize Plateau.

920
00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:57.150
They're the records of Thoth, or Hermes.

921
00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:58.770
They're the Emerald Tablets.

922
00:33:58.770 --> 00:33:59.410
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

923
00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:01.250
<v ->Well, I don't care what you call them,</v>

924
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:02.850
but if we find them,

925
00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:05.310
let's translate them quickly and publish them.

926
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.070
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

927
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:09.570
And many, many courses of study

928
00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:11.890
and people studying the Emerald Tablets,

929
00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:14.150
and yeah, Keys of Enoch and such.

930
00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:15.450
<v ->Right.</v>

931
00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:19.410
<v Voiceover>Alright, so now I'd like to talk about,</v>

932
00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:21.160
we have Edgar Cayce,

933
00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.650
who had this phenomenal ability

934
00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:24.966
to essentially open to any and all information.

935
00:34:24.966 --> 00:34:26.746
Nothing was hidden from him

936
00:34:26.746 --> 00:34:29.186
as a channel of that information.

937
00:34:29.186 --> 00:34:30.606
What is he saying,

938
00:34:30.606 --> 00:34:33.346
and what are you observing in your own work,

939
00:34:33.346 --> 00:34:34.046
you own life,

940
00:34:34.046 --> 00:34:36.166
and through the people you are in contact with

941
00:34:36.166 --> 00:34:38.306
as to our potential right now.

942
00:34:38.306 --> 00:34:41.186
Where are we, what do we--

943
00:34:41.186 --> 00:34:43.406
how far are we away

944
00:34:43.406 --> 00:34:45.586
from being able to start embodying

945
00:34:45.586 --> 00:34:46.706
that trade ourselves

946
00:34:46.706 --> 00:34:49.666
of surrendering to the conscious mind,

947
00:34:49.666 --> 00:34:51.486
the great cosmic mind?

948
00:34:51.486 --> 00:34:52.866
<v ->Right, right.</v>

949
00:34:52.866 --> 00:34:56.826
I am always asked, how close are we

950
00:34:56.826 --> 00:34:59.326
to the great illumination and liberation

951
00:34:59.326 --> 00:35:00.946
from this situation,

952
00:35:00.946 --> 00:35:03.646
and the truth is,

953
00:35:03.646 --> 00:35:05.166
all the prophecies,

954
00:35:05.166 --> 00:35:07.146
from the archangel Gabriel

955
00:35:07.146 --> 00:35:09.526
to Daniel in the Old Testament,

956
00:35:09.526 --> 00:35:12.546
even Jesus's comments and Matthew 24

957
00:35:12.546 --> 00:35:15.726
and the revelation, Nostradamus,

958
00:35:15.726 --> 00:35:18.406
even the little prophecies from Mary,

959
00:35:18.406 --> 00:35:20.366
the mother of Jesus,

960
00:35:20.366 --> 00:35:23.006
the Bishop of Ireland, Malachy,

961
00:35:23.006 --> 00:35:25.626
who prophesied the whole reign of the popes.

962
00:35:25.626 --> 00:35:27.226
There are only two more left,

963
00:35:27.226 --> 00:35:29.646
the current one and one more.

964
00:35:29.646 --> 00:35:32.886
All these prophecies are pointing

965
00:35:32.886 --> 00:35:34.286
to our times.

966
00:35:34.286 --> 00:35:34.786
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

967
00:35:34.786 --> 00:35:36.506
<v ->Now, how long it will be, I'm not sure.</v>

968
00:35:36.506 --> 00:35:39.466
Cayce says we're in a transition period.

969
00:35:39.466 --> 00:35:44.226
He actually says that the time, times, and half-times

970
00:35:44.226 --> 00:35:48.506
that Gabriel told Daniel would be the length are over.

971
00:35:48.506 --> 00:35:50.306
That's a major statement.

972
00:35:50.306 --> 00:35:51.366
They're over.

973
00:35:51.366 --> 00:35:54.366
We are in the transition to the new era,

974
00:35:54.366 --> 00:35:57.526
and that new era is going to be as a thousand years

975
00:35:57.526 --> 00:36:00.266
in which no evil will be on the planet,

976
00:36:00.266 --> 00:36:01.206
no temptation.

977
00:36:01.206 --> 00:36:02.886
A golden age.

978
00:36:02.886 --> 00:36:05.646
Now, in the Marian prophecies,

979
00:36:05.646 --> 00:36:08.846
you get the sense that she's warning everybody.

980
00:36:08.846 --> 00:36:10.726
You can't come into this era

981
00:36:10.726 --> 00:36:13.266
with any sort of darkness still in your heart,

982
00:36:13.266 --> 00:36:15.346
so get all of your bitterness out,

983
00:36:15.346 --> 00:36:17.266
process it all.

984
00:36:17.266 --> 00:36:19.446
The Ancient Egyptians were the same way.

985
00:36:19.446 --> 00:36:23.566
They looked to the dung beetle as a sign of resurrection,

986
00:36:23.566 --> 00:36:26.206
and they knew dung was gonna happen,

987
00:36:26.206 --> 00:36:29.666
but if you, like the little, humble dung beetle,

988
00:36:29.666 --> 00:36:33.406
rolled your problems towards the rising sun

989
00:36:33.406 --> 00:36:35.426
and planted a seed of resurrection,

990
00:36:35.426 --> 00:36:39.066
when that dung ball got hot and that seed exploded,

991
00:36:39.066 --> 00:36:41.846
you'd lift out into your higher level

992
00:36:41.846 --> 00:36:44.566
and leave all the dung of your life behind you.

993
00:36:44.566 --> 00:36:45.486
That's the thing.

994
00:36:45.486 --> 00:36:47.826
So sometimes in the dark problems,

995
00:36:47.826 --> 00:36:49.526
in the bitter feelings you have,

996
00:36:49.526 --> 00:36:51.166
in the regrets,

997
00:36:51.166 --> 00:36:53.506
in the unfulfilled dreams and all,

998
00:36:53.506 --> 00:36:56.586
if you'll process those and let go of those,

999
00:36:56.586 --> 00:36:58.986
you will lift yourself into a condition,

1000
00:36:58.986 --> 00:37:01.166
you can go into the new era.

1001
00:37:01.166 --> 00:37:04.646
The Egyptians said your heart has to be light.

1002
00:37:04.646 --> 00:37:06.346
They would put a feather on one scale

1003
00:37:06.346 --> 00:37:07.706
and your heart on the other,

1004
00:37:07.706 --> 00:37:09.086
and it had to be lighter than the feather.

1005
00:37:09.086 --> 00:37:09.706
<v Voiceover>Than the feather, yes.</v>

1006
00:37:09.706 --> 00:37:12.746
<v ->Or you couldn't go in to the heavenly dimensions.</v>

1007
00:37:12.746 --> 00:37:14.506
So if your heart's heavy,

1008
00:37:14.506 --> 00:37:16.586
work on lightening it up.

1009
00:37:16.586 --> 00:37:18.586
And then you can go into this next stage,

1010
00:37:18.586 --> 00:37:19.646
and it's a long period.

1011
00:37:19.646 --> 00:37:21.506
You can reincarnate multiple times;

1012
00:37:21.506 --> 00:37:23.146
it's a long period.

1013
00:37:23.146 --> 00:37:24.546
<v Voiceover>And that's what I've heard</v>

1014
00:37:24.546 --> 00:37:26.026
by another wise being

1015
00:37:26.026 --> 00:37:28.706
was simply if we can look at each other

1016
00:37:28.706 --> 00:37:30.026
without judgement,

1017
00:37:30.026 --> 00:37:31.546
just start not judging

1018
00:37:31.546 --> 00:37:34.166
and understanding we are each other's brother and sister,

1019
00:37:34.166 --> 00:37:35.406
and we've all been through

1020
00:37:35.406 --> 00:37:38.466
this very long and arduous journey together

1021
00:37:38.466 --> 00:37:42.326
and have that just compassion for the other,

1022
00:37:42.326 --> 00:37:43.986
that that's the first key.

1023
00:37:43.986 --> 00:37:44.606
That's it

1024
00:37:44.606 --> 00:37:45.206
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1025
00:37:45.206 --> 00:37:45.746
<v Voiceover>Really.</v>

1026
00:37:45.746 --> 00:37:46.726
If we can accomplish that,

1027
00:37:46.726 --> 00:37:48.286
then we've lightened our heart to that extent.

1028
00:37:48.286 --> 00:37:49.206
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

1029
00:37:49.206 --> 00:37:49.666
That's it.

1030
00:37:49.666 --> 00:37:50.686
<v Voiceover>Is that your experience?</v>

1031
00:37:50.686 --> 00:37:52.906
<v ->It sounds so simple, doesn't it?</v>

1032
00:37:52.906 --> 00:37:53.746
<v Voiceover>But it's not easy.</v>

1033
00:37:53.746 --> 00:37:55.166
<v ->No, it's not easy.</v>

1034
00:37:55.166 --> 00:37:56.206
<v Voiceover>We've been programmed</v>

1035
00:37:56.206 --> 00:37:57.386
through out incarnations

1036
00:37:57.386 --> 00:38:00.146
with a lot of stuff lurking there in the subconscious

1037
00:38:00.146 --> 00:38:02.686
that we're reacting to and not even knowing why.

1038
00:38:02.686 --> 00:38:03.586
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1039
00:38:03.586 --> 00:38:05.086
Edgar Cayce was once asked

1040
00:38:05.086 --> 00:38:08.606
how the high priest RaTa rejuvenated his body,

1041
00:38:08.606 --> 00:38:10.926
and when he answered, I was stunned.

1042
00:38:10.926 --> 00:38:13.086
The answer was he let go

1043
00:38:13.086 --> 00:38:15.786
of the things that had aged him.

1044
00:38:15.786 --> 00:38:17.826
We hold on to those little things.

1045
00:38:17.826 --> 00:38:19.986
I remember what you said. (laughs)

1046
00:38:19.986 --> 00:38:22.106
I remember what you did.

1047
00:38:22.106 --> 00:38:23.846
I feel this, I feel that.

1048
00:38:23.846 --> 00:38:26.886
If you let go of those, you lighten the body.

1049
00:38:26.886 --> 00:38:27.426
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1050
00:38:27.426 --> 00:38:28.446
<v ->You can renew it.</v>

1051
00:38:28.446 --> 00:38:30.246
But if you keep the body weighed down

1052
00:38:30.246 --> 00:38:31.906
with all those things--

1053
00:38:31.906 --> 00:38:33.406
<v Voiceover>Great anti-aging protocol.</v>

1054
00:38:33.406 --> 00:38:34.086
<v ->Yes.</v>

1055
00:38:34.086 --> 00:38:36.286
(both laugh)

1056
00:38:36.286 --> 00:38:37.106
<v Voiceover>On that thought,</v>

1057
00:38:37.106 --> 00:38:39.466
any final thoughts of what you yourself

1058
00:38:39.466 --> 00:38:41.046
when you're working with some of the people

1059
00:38:41.046 --> 00:38:42.686
here at the Institute

1060
00:38:42.686 --> 00:38:44.706
or whether you're out speaking to large groups

1061
00:38:44.706 --> 00:38:46.706
that, besides what you just said,

1062
00:38:46.706 --> 00:38:48.766
that you would like to put out

1063
00:38:48.766 --> 00:38:51.606
as a potential seed to plant for this transition

1064
00:38:51.606 --> 00:38:52.806
in each one of us?

1065
00:38:52.806 --> 00:38:53.486
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1066
00:38:53.486 --> 00:38:57.026
I actually think, despite all the stuff

1067
00:38:57.026 --> 00:38:59.506
that's going on in the world,

1068
00:38:59.506 --> 00:39:01.546
we are making great progress

1069
00:39:01.546 --> 00:39:04.086
because right now, you can't get into a fight

1070
00:39:04.086 --> 00:39:05.746
on this planet without the rest of us

1071
00:39:05.746 --> 00:39:07.486
sticking our nose into your fight

1072
00:39:07.486 --> 00:39:08.766
and trying to break it up.

1073
00:39:08.766 --> 00:39:10.226
And you can't starve somewhere

1074
00:39:10.226 --> 00:39:12.366
without us dropping food from the sky

1075
00:39:12.366 --> 00:39:13.626
if we can pull it off.

1076
00:39:13.626 --> 00:39:13.922
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

1077
00:39:13.922 --> 00:39:15.702
<v ->Even though the bad guys are trying to steal it.</v>

1078
00:39:15.702 --> 00:39:16.062
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

1079
00:39:16.062 --> 00:39:16.782
(both laugh)

1080
00:39:16.782 --> 00:39:17.722
<v ->That we'll do everything.</v>

1081
00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:18.562
<v Voiceover>Or stop the delivery.</v>

1082
00:39:18.562 --> 00:39:19.642
<v ->Right.</v>

1083
00:39:19.642 --> 00:39:23.182
So I think there's actually a growing sense

1084
00:39:23.182 --> 00:39:25.742
of the people of the planet.

1085
00:39:25.742 --> 00:39:28.842
Now you just let one alien show up,

1086
00:39:28.842 --> 00:39:31.182
and we'll all feel like we're one people.

1087
00:39:31.182 --> 00:39:32.282
(both laugh)

1088
00:39:32.282 --> 00:39:33.422
<v Voiceover>That has been suggested</v>

1089
00:39:33.422 --> 00:39:35.382
by the military industrial complex.

1090
00:39:35.382 --> 00:39:38.142
(both laugh)

1091
00:39:38.142 --> 00:39:38.562
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1092
00:39:38.562 --> 00:39:39.562
There are many ways

1093
00:39:39.562 --> 00:39:42.162
that you can see certain progress occurring.

1094
00:39:42.162 --> 00:39:42.722
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

1095
00:39:42.722 --> 00:39:44.382
<v ->Even though there's a lot of darkness.</v>

1096
00:39:44.382 --> 00:39:45.242
At the last minute

1097
00:39:45.242 --> 00:39:48.242
the darkness is at its peak of resistance,

1098
00:39:48.242 --> 00:39:51.162
when the light is ready to break totally through,

1099
00:39:51.162 --> 00:39:53.122
and I think we're dealing with that a lot.

1100
00:39:53.122 --> 00:39:54.702
<v Voiceover>I agree with you.</v>

1101
00:39:54.702 --> 00:39:55.922
I can feel that.

1102
00:39:55.922 --> 00:39:56.382
<v ->Good.</v>

1103
00:39:56.382 --> 00:39:57.182
<v Voiceover>And thank you so much.</v>

1104
00:39:57.182 --> 00:39:58.902
It's been absolutely as delightful

1105
00:39:58.902 --> 00:40:01.202
as I had expected to sit with you.

1106
00:40:01.202 --> 00:40:01.922
<v ->You're welcome.</v>

1107
00:40:01.922 --> 00:40:02.782
<v Voiceover>Thank you, John.</v>

1108
00:40:02.782 --> 00:40:03.262
<v ->Uh-huh.</v>

1109
00:40:03.262 --> 00:40:04.082
It's been good.

1110
00:40:05.942 --> 00:40:08.274
<v ->John has authored 17 books on Cayce's work,</v>

1111
00:40:08.274 --> 00:40:10.614
as well as appearing on several DVDs.

1112
00:40:10.614 --> 00:40:12.894
I highly recommend that you go to his website

1113
00:40:12.894 --> 00:40:14.934
at johnvanauken.com

1114
00:40:14.934 --> 00:40:17.354
or to edgarcayce.org to connect

1115
00:40:17.354 --> 00:40:18.894
with his body of work.

1116
00:40:18.894 --> 00:40:20.714
In addition, he's created his own system

1117
00:40:20.714 --> 00:40:22.554
of reaching into your soul

1118
00:40:22.554 --> 00:40:23.954
for your greater understanding,

1119
00:40:23.954 --> 00:40:26.134
which you can also find on his website.

1120
00:40:26.134 --> 00:40:27.494
Meanwhile, you might also enjoy

1121
00:40:27.494 --> 00:40:29.314
my interview with Sidney Kirkpatrick,

1122
00:40:29.314 --> 00:40:31.394
who chronicled the life of Edgar Cayce

1123
00:40:31.394 --> 00:40:33.314
in fascinating detail.

1124
00:40:33.314 --> 00:40:34.094
Until next time,

1125
00:40:34.094 --> 00:40:36.524
thanks for watching CMN.
