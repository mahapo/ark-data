00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.845 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
John Burke has

00:00:01.845 --> 00:00:04.100 align:middle line:84%
stumbled upon some profound
information regarding

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.470 align:middle line:84%
many of the sacred
sites around the world.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.700 align:middle line:84%
After spending years in
R&D in the seed industry,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.200 align:middle line:84%
John discovered that
the energetic output

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.880 align:middle line:84%
of many of the
world's sacred sites

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.450 align:middle line:84%
also served to charge
the indigenous seeds.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.030 align:middle line:84%
This translates to
greater yield of crops.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.880 align:middle line:84%
To his astonishment, he even
found ancient seed depositories

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.380 align:middle line:84%
at key energetic locations on
sites, such as Avery, England.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.260 align:middle line:84%
These findings have opened up
a question as to whether or not

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.038 align:middle line:84%
some of these sites
may have been designed

00:00:33.038 --> 00:00:35.030 align:middle line:84%
for just such
purposes in times when

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.022 align:middle line:90%
there was a shortage of food.

00:00:37.022 --> 00:00:41.504 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:41.504 --> 00:00:44.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.770 align:middle line:10%
You have a very interesting take
on what the ancient structures,

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.660 align:middle line:10%
the ancient sites
around the world

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.130 align:middle line:10%
may have also been used for, if
not in some cases, created for.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.010 align:middle line:10%
So let's start kind of at
the beginning with your--

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.730 align:middle line:10%
the discovery of the
electrical and electromagnetic

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.400 align:middle line:10%
emanations coming from these
incredible sacred sites

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:10%
of the world.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.400 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHN BURKE: Well,
the beginning, for me,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.480 align:middle line:10%
was 1993, because this was
really an accidental discovery

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.290 align:middle line:10%
using a magnetometer on the
stones at Avebury Henge,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.960 align:middle line:10%
and finding that there seemed
to be some sort of pattern

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.830 align:middle line:10%
to the magnetic poles of
the stones themselves.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.740 align:middle line:10%
And that was enough to
intrigue us to spend

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.290 align:middle line:10%
five weeks that summer--

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.940 align:middle line:10%
my co-author Kai
Hallberg and myself--

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.880 align:middle line:10%
in the field taking 1,000
measurements on 66 stones

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.040 align:middle line:10%
to ultimately determine
that, sure enough,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:10%
of the hundreds of stones
that originally made up

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.170 align:middle line:10%
this giant forerunner
of Stonehenge,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.040 align:middle line:10%
the 66 that remain literally
all have their north poles

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.780 align:middle line:10%
pointed in the same direction.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.450 align:middle line:10%
And this can't be a
question of chance.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:10%
And furthermore, these
stones get larger

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.470 align:middle line:10%
as you approach the entrance.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:10%
And it's not only true here
in Avebury but in Carnac,

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.200 align:middle line:10%
France on a far
bigger scale, where

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.457 align:middle line:10%
there's 11,000 stones
in kilometer-long rows.

00:02:10.457 --> 00:02:12.540 align:middle line:10%
And the importance about
the thing growing larger,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.580 align:middle line:10%
as it goes, is that it will
move electrified air ions along

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.960 align:middle line:10%
through the air and end up
acting as a very low energy

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:10%
supercollider, if you will.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.832 align:middle line:84%
It's the same principle that
a supercollider runs on.

00:02:26.832 --> 00:02:29.040 align:middle line:10%
And of course, they weren't
doing high energy physics

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:10%
there, but what they were
doing is gathering these ions

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.070 align:middle line:10%
in order to enhance the
performance of the seeds.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.911 align:middle line:10%
And this would do
that very efficiently.

00:02:36.911 --> 00:02:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
let's get into that.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some of
the sites around the world

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.330 align:middle line:84%
that you visited, because
we don't have your slideshow

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.130 align:middle line:90%
to show right now.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.177 align:middle line:84%
So there's some really
wonderful imagery in there.

00:02:46.177 --> 00:02:47.760 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
some of the sites

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.960 align:middle line:84%
you've been to to measure
the electromagnetic outputs,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.730 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people think of
these as more in new age terms.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sacred sites-- go.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.500 align:middle line:90%
You sit down.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.300 align:middle line:90%
You meditate.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.310 align:middle line:90%
But why?

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.074 align:middle line:90%
Well, you can tell people why.

00:03:01.074 --> 00:03:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BURKE: Because
they're all based

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:84%
on very special type
of geological ground

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.000 align:middle line:84%
that does give off
electromagnetic,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.880 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't so much
give it off as what

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.260 align:middle line:84%
it does is it uses special types
of ground that already enhance

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.350 align:middle line:84%
the natural electromagnetic
forces of the earth,

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.790 align:middle line:90%
in particular the daily changes.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And then they build these
structures in such a way

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:84%
that they further enhance up
to several hundred percent

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.340 align:middle line:84%
these natural electrical and
magnetic fluctuations that

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.440 align:middle line:84%
take place everywhere
around the world,

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.190 align:middle line:84%
every day in the
hours before dawn.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.220 align:middle line:84%
That's the earth's
magnetic field changing,

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and it changes most dramatically
in these pre-dawn hours.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is interesting,
because throughout all

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:84%
of the cultures
historically, that's

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.610 align:middle line:84%
when the various masters, the
monks, the yogis, et cetera

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:90%
go into their meditation.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BURKE: Precisely.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
question of where--

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.930 align:middle line:84%
it's a simple matter of
physics called induction.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Whenever there is a
change in magnetic field,

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.810 align:middle line:84%
it generates in an electrical
field in anything present

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.370 align:middle line:90%
that will conduct electricity.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.964 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, the brain
conducts it very well.

00:04:10.964 --> 00:04:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.190 align:middle line:84%
So you've been to
how many sites?

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And how many sites have
you personally measured,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.839 align:middle line:84%
and also, how many sites
do you know of that

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.450 align:middle line:90%
have been measured to have this?

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And include the most
famous sites in the world.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BURKE: Well, I've
measured over 80 sites

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.750 align:middle line:90%
between my partner and myself.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And then the French
sites I was referring

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:84%
to were measured by a
Belgian engineer, who

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.290 align:middle line:90%
came before me, Pierre Moreau.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.030 align:middle line:90%
He passed away a few years ago.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.560 align:middle line:90%
But he was an engineer.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:84%
He happened to choose
the same instruments,

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and he spent his summer
vacation every year

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:84%
for 33 years
studying these sites

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and finding out
that in every case,

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.400 align:middle line:84%
it's the oldest and
most densely populated

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.110 align:middle line:84%
of megalithic
sites in the world,

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.350 align:middle line:90%
probably, starting in 4800, BC.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.577 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
things were built where

00:05:03.577 --> 00:05:04.660 align:middle line:90%
there were these special--

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Carnac
you're referring to?

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BURKE: Carnac, exactly.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Carnac.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And what he found was all of
the major structures at Carnac

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.280 align:middle line:84%
were located where there were
these special geologically

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.190 align:middle line:90%
generated energy gradients.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, where your
work gets really interesting--

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Did you have something
more you were going to say?

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.646 align:middle line:84%
>>BURKE: No, just that then,
I, myself, have visited

00:05:23.646 --> 00:05:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Central America,
North America, Europe,

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and one thing I always
like to emphasize

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.230 align:middle line:84%
is that we Americans
tend to think

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.680 align:middle line:84%
that to go visit
one of these sites,

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.110 align:middle line:84%
you've got to get on a
plane and go overseas.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.480 align:middle line:10%
And the fact is that
with these rock chambers

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.440 align:middle line:10%
we have in the Northeastern US
and the mounds that still exist

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.890 align:middle line:10%
in the hundreds throughout
the central United States,

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.120 align:middle line:10%
as well as certain vision
quest sites in the West, 2/3

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.580 align:middle line:10%
of the American population
is within a few hours'

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.580 align:middle line:10%
drive of one of these
type of structures.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.880 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, one
appendix of our book

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.550 align:middle line:10%
lists them
alphabetically by state.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, very good.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:02.500 align:middle line:90%
That's good to know.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BURKE: And how to get there
and what their hours are,

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.720 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:10%
And we have another
appendix, then,

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:10%
that tells people how they
can get their own instruments,

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:10%
and go out, and either confirm
or refute our measurements.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And the overlay
here, which is so interesting,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.080 align:middle line:10%
is once you started
noticing this,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.240 align:middle line:10%
you put a whole
agricultural overlay

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.610 align:middle line:10%
to this, which
really, everyone's

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.180 align:middle line:10%
excited about your work, because
this isn't something that's

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.880 align:middle line:10%
ordinarily thought of
in terms of Egyptology

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.150 align:middle line:10%
and the study of Avebury,
Glastonbury, Stonehenge,

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.950 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.540 align:middle line:10%
But tell us about how this
came together for you-- seeds--

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.240 align:middle line:10%
and this particular energetic
dynamic of these sites.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.200 align:middle line:10%
>>BURKE: Sheer luck
is the short answer.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.790 align:middle line:10%
That's where I feel blessed
to have had this kind of luck.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.820 align:middle line:10%
I was working for a
company at the time that

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.500 align:middle line:10%
uses these very weak
electron showers in the air,

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.960 align:middle line:10%
actually, to improve
the production

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.166 align:middle line:10%
of agricultural seed.

00:07:00.166 --> 00:07:01.540 align:middle line:10%
And we knew that
it would make it

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.310 align:middle line:10%
more stress tolerance, and most
important, increase yields.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.670 align:middle line:10%
And that has been confirmed in
hundreds of third party tests,

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.230 align:middle line:10%
including universities,
et cetera.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.380 align:middle line:10%
So I was in that
frame of mind, when

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.780 align:middle line:10%
I stumbled onto these sites,
got interested in them,

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.750 align:middle line:10%
and then began
reading up on them

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.790 align:middle line:10%
and finding out
something very peculiar

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.270 align:middle line:10%
that the chronology of these
sites, when you look at it,

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.990 align:middle line:10%
repeatedly is that there was
a group of people undergoing

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.030 align:middle line:10%
food pressure, a food crisis.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.940 align:middle line:10%
They needed desperately
to raise their yields,

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.470 align:middle line:10%
because before 1000, BC,
fertilizer and crop rotation

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.260 align:middle line:10%
were unknown everywhere
in the world.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.500 align:middle line:10%
And so they were
desperate for any way

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.440 align:middle line:10%
to produce increased
food production,

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.410 align:middle line:10%
and they start building these
enormous structures, which

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.330 align:middle line:10%
are perfectly designed to
maximize these forces that we

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.740 align:middle line:10%
know can improve
food production.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.610 align:middle line:10%
So then the next thing we were
tempted to do and started doing

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.920 align:middle line:10%
was bringing the actual
seed to the actual sites

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.150 align:middle line:10%
and seeing extremely dramatic
increases, because we

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:11.050 align:middle line:10%
used the same old, if
you would, heirloom seeds

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.880 align:middle line:10%
that were used by
the builders, which

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.260 align:middle line:10%
are much weaker than
today's modern seed.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.520 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Indigenous seed,
thousands of year old seed.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.320 align:middle line:10%
>>BURKE: Yeah.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.060 align:middle line:10%
Well, in the case, for example,
in the Northeast, we used--

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.820 align:middle line:10%
it's seed that goes
back to 700, AD.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.090 align:middle line:10%
But it was the seed used by
the Native American builders

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.220 align:middle line:10%
at the same time
period as the ones who

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.660 align:middle line:10%
put up these structures.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.809 align:middle line:10%
And we've also done it
with beans and wheat, which

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:38.530 align:middle line:10%
was the primary staple
in most of Europe,

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.950 align:middle line:10%
and gotten anywhere
from modest increases

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:46.510 align:middle line:10%
to, with the Indian seed
corn, in particular, though,

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.120 align:middle line:10%
that across the board,
the results were

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.975 align:middle line:10%
to double or triple
the yield of the seeds.

00:08:51.975 --> 00:08:53.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes,
absolutely amazing

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.610 align:middle line:10%
when you see the
photographs of what

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.220 align:middle line:10%
happens in the seeds after being
on these ancient structures,

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.680 align:middle line:10%
and for a relatively short
period of time, the exposure,

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.490 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:04.600 align:middle line:10%
>>BURKE: Just 20 to 70 minutes
has been more than enough.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.860 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely amazing.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.984 align:middle line:10%
>>BURKE: That surprised us.

00:09:06.984 --> 00:09:09.400 align:middle line:84%
We thought we might have to
take hours or days, but it--

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, something's
just occurring to me

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.370 align:middle line:90%
as we're talking.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.455 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, we're
at CPAC, and we're

00:09:14.455 --> 00:09:16.780 align:middle line:84%
with some of the top
Egyptologists in the world,

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean arguably.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BURKE: Literally.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Literally.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.470 align:middle line:10%
And while it may not
be correct to say

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.260 align:middle line:10%
that the pyramids of Giza
were developed simply

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:10%
for enhanced seed
for the region,

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:36.100 align:middle line:10%
it might very
easily be said that

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.542 align:middle line:10%
whoever it was that was able
to help engineer these pyramids

00:09:39.542 --> 00:09:40.750 align:middle line:10%
and who have that knowledge--

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.630 align:middle line:10%
I mean like Quetzalcoatl
and characters

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:10%
throughout history that came
and taught indigenous peoples

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.490 align:middle line:10%
about agriculture,
architecture, et

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle line:10%
cetera in their
own myth and lore,

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:10%
perhaps the very same
forces did teach,

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:10%
have brought that knowledge
throughout history

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.090 align:middle line:10%
to all these regions
of the world,

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.990 align:middle line:10%
teaching people how to enhance
their own crops, how to--

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:10%
yes.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.940 align:middle line:10%
>>BURKE: Well, the
best example of all

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.760 align:middle line:10%
are these stone chambers, as
we call them in the Northeast,

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.210 align:middle line:10%
that we did our own experiments
on and got these results, that

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.520 align:middle line:10%
are called dolmens
in the old world.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're built in the
thousands from Ireland to India

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
over a 3,000-mile expanse
over a 6,000-year history.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they look kind
of like stone tables or--

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BURKE: Sometimes.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And others like
beehive-shaped chambers, yes.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And the point was if you want
to argue that these things were

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.860 align:middle line:84%
cultural, you have
to realize that there

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.650 align:middle line:84%
was no single culture
dominating that period

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.046 align:middle line:90%
for that length of time.

00:10:40.046 --> 00:10:41.920 align:middle line:84%
So that gave us all the
more reason to think,

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, there's a
functional aspect

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.460 align:middle line:90%
here behind these things.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So in Egypt, Egypt also met
the profile, as it turned out,

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.870 align:middle line:84%
of these construction of
the first massive pyramids

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.670 align:middle line:84%
beginning when
there were starting

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:01.600 align:middle line:84%
to be food crises on
hand, because the Nile was

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:84%
no longer consistently
flooding and bringing

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.040 align:middle line:84%
the fertilizing muck
up onto the soil.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.140 align:middle line:10%
And there were
famines that are still

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:15.340 align:middle line:10%
detectable on the historic
record, if you will,

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.470 align:middle line:10%
beginning to develop
as a result of that,

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:20.530 align:middle line:10%
because when you don't have
some form of fertilizer,

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.002 align:middle line:10%
the soil's exhausted in as
little as two to three years.

00:11:23.002 --> 00:11:25.210 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And your population
is burgeoning, perhaps.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:26.830 align:middle line:10%
>>BURKE: Yes, exactly.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:28.390 align:middle line:10%
Where there's full
time agriculture,

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.820 align:middle line:10%
there's always a
growing population.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.840 align:middle line:84%
So that deadly combination
eventually reaches a climax,

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.690 align:middle line:84%
and it was right
at that time when

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Imhotep, the most brilliant
Egyptian ever to live,

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.200 align:middle line:84%
was called in by King
Djoser to start this crash

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.000 align:middle line:84%
campaign of building
these giant pyramids,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.610 align:middle line:84%
because most of those giant ones
were built in 150-year period,

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.760 align:middle line:84%
as if there was great
urgency to get them done.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.280 align:middle line:10%
And the argument that they
were built as tombs just

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.100 align:middle line:10%
doesn't wash, because not only
has a body never been found,

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.960 align:middle line:10%
but a pharaoh built
three of them.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.626 align:middle line:10%
And I don't think he
needed three tombs.

00:12:03.626 --> 00:12:07.550 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And it doesn't wash
with any of the gentlemen

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:08.800 align:middle line:10%
here at the conference at all.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.600 align:middle line:10%
>>BURKE: Exactly.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.410 align:middle line:10%
There seems to be unanimity
on that point here.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:16.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, Egypt gave me a hard time
for a long while, because you

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.150 align:middle line:10%
can't do what we did, for
example, with the Mayan

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:23.440 align:middle line:10%
pyramids at Tikal, where we
brought the seed to the top

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.360 align:middle line:10%
and exposed them
to these energies

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.110 align:middle line:10%
and got even more dramatic
improvements than I've

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:30.640 align:middle line:10%
been mentioning.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.760 align:middle line:10%
And on top of that, we got to
see that there is a continuing

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.110 align:middle line:10%
tradition with the Mayans.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.350 align:middle line:10%
They still bring their seed
to the top of pyramids,

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.486 align:middle line:10%
but they bring them
to the wrong pyramids.

00:12:40.486 --> 00:12:41.860 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Because
it's only lore,

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.480 align:middle line:10%
and they don't
really understand.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.700 align:middle line:10%
They don't have necessarily
the instrumentation

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.110 align:middle line:10%
to be able to see the output.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.910 align:middle line:10%
>>BURKE: Yes.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.110 align:middle line:10%
Somewhere along the
line, there was probably

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.710 align:middle line:10%
a shaman or a priest, who
died at the wrong time

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.690 align:middle line:10%
before he could pass
the knowledge along.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And all they have
left is the tradition.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.940 align:middle line:84%
But so the question was then,
what were the Egyptian pyramids

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:02.740 align:middle line:90%
all about?

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.420 align:middle line:84%
You can't carry
anything to the top.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.660 align:middle line:10%
But when you begin
looking at the geology

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.870 align:middle line:10%
of the areas like
the Giza Plateau

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.000 align:middle line:10%
and the whole West
Bank of the Nile,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.390 align:middle line:10%
the geology begins to make
a very strong suggestion

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.690 align:middle line:10%
about them being possibly
about something else entirely.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.290 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Because the geology
is very energy-saturated.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BURKE: Yes, because
the banks of the Nile

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.880 align:middle line:90%
are the limestone aquifers.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And when the level of
the Nile rises and falls,

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.980 align:middle line:84%
you've got a lot of water
passing through limestone,

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.570 align:middle line:84%
which is known to produce
strong electric ground

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:90%
current naturally.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's known to
physics, and we've

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.760 align:middle line:84%
measured it ourselves in England
at Silbury Hill, the largest

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.880 align:middle line:90%
hill in England.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a
good situation there

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.620 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of ground charge,
and what's interesting

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.290 align:middle line:84%
then is they chose to build
those giant pyramids out

00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:00.040 align:middle line:84%
of a type of limestone that
it was what was closest,

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:84%
but at Giza, but not
necessarily at the other places.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.760 align:middle line:84%
But the type of limestone
they built for the core

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:11.480 align:middle line:84%
was dolomite, which has
especially high metal content.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.940 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's
got a special name.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.720 align:middle line:84%
It's got I think 25%
manganese content.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, it
will conduct electricity

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.650 align:middle line:90%
extremely well.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Then, they went to all that
trouble to go across the river

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and get the Tora limestone,
which, granted, is whiter,

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.280 align:middle line:90%
and it's prettier.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, for the facing.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BURKE: Right.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Then they encase it in that, and
that the blocks, if you recall,

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.650 align:middle line:84%
that they went to
so much trouble

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.191 align:middle line:84%
that all these years
later, you can't

00:14:37.191 --> 00:14:38.570 align:middle line:90%
get a razor blade in between.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:39.528 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:14:39.528 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BURKE: Well, that
is almost pure CaCO3.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.020 align:middle line:84%
It's almost-- there's
almost no metal in that,

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:84%
so by comparison, it's a poor
conductor of electricity.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:54.430 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a similar
situation to an insulated wire.

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:57.910 align:middle line:84%
All the negative energy
gathered in the ground

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.010 align:middle line:84%
from the water running
through the limestone

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:04.870 align:middle line:84%
concentrates at the top and this
wrapping of the Tora limestone

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.340 align:middle line:90%
prevents it from leaking off.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And then finally,
at the top, it looks

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:15.130 align:middle line:84%
like they would add either
metal or golden capstones.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is
that 50 days a year,

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:22.750 align:middle line:84%
there's a Saharan wind called
the Khamsin blowing out

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:23.860 align:middle line:90%
of the desert.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's extremely highly
positively charged.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And the very shape
of a pyramid will

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:36.410 align:middle line:84%
concentrate the field lines of
the atmosphere at the point.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:84%
So we've got this
tremendous concentration

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.590 align:middle line:84%
of negative charge at the
bottom, positive charge

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:45.050 align:middle line:84%
at the top, and if that
becomes strong enough,

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:49.590 align:middle line:84%
it'll so excite and electrify
the air, it will begin to glow.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And we get what we
call brush discharge.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, the important thing
about brush discharge

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.210 align:middle line:84%
is, sure, it makes a very
impressive religious monument.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And awe is part of a
religious monument,

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and that's possibly
one of the reasons.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.920 align:middle line:84%
But when there's
brush discharge,

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:84%
it changes the
nitrogen in the air.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Regular nitrogen in
the air is common,

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.820 align:middle line:90%
but it's useless to plants.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.990 align:middle line:84%
When it's ionized, as it
always is in brush discharge,

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:19.530 align:middle line:84%
it's converted to nitrate,
which is the primary component

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:20.330 align:middle line:90%
of fertilizer.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, primary
nutrient in fertilizer.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.720 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BURKE: So what we
were looking at, then,

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.060 align:middle line:84%
is at least 50
days a year, you've

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.040 align:middle line:84%
got a fertilizing
wind blowing off

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.150 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids that
just happens to occur

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:36.840 align:middle line:90%
when the Nile is at its lowest.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the ground
energy is at its strongest,

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:41.820 align:middle line:90%
and the fields are exposed.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And they only started doing
that after they needed

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:48.870 align:middle line:84%
the fertilizer, and then
they located those pyramids

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:middle line:90%
downwind from the farms.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And as the situation
got more desperate,

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.000 align:middle line:84%
they expanded the farmland
continually to the north.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you watch the
chronology of the pyramids,

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.396 align:middle line:84%
each new one would be
planted further north.

00:17:03.396 --> 00:17:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It makes
a lot of sense

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:08.339 align:middle line:84%
that that had to have
been at least one,

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:12.480 align:middle line:84%
if not the primary motivation
for a lot of these structures.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.160 align:middle line:10%
>>BURKE: Well, one
of the things I

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.310 align:middle line:10%
like to think about as an
analogy on that subject

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.980 align:middle line:10%
is to think about
ourselves today.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.903 align:middle line:84%
We're the same people
they were in the sense

00:17:21.903 --> 00:17:23.069 align:middle line:90%
that we have the same brain.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:24.485 align:middle line:84%
We just work in
different mediums.

00:17:24.485 --> 00:17:26.960 align:middle line:90%


00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:31.030 align:middle line:10%
The biggest structures in the
world today built by humankind

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.890 align:middle line:10%
are undoubtedly
hydroelectric dams.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.040 align:middle line:10%
And why are we willing to go
to such mind-boggling effort

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.140 align:middle line:10%
in building some of these dams?

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.900 align:middle line:10%
Because we know we're going
to get a very physical return

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:10%
in the form of
electricity, which

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.470 align:middle line:10%
is the lifeblood of our
industrial civilization.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.200 align:middle line:10%
And by comparison, looking
into specialty structures

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.930 align:middle line:10%
like the giant
pyramids, I wonder

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:58.460 align:middle line:10%
if they weren't able to
mobilize a population to such

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.620 align:middle line:10%
an extreme degree,
because they, too,

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:05.030 align:middle line:10%
knew they were going to get an
absolutely physical reward back

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:08.510 align:middle line:10%
in terms of fertility,
which is the lifeblood

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.970 align:middle line:10%
of any agricultural
civilization.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:11.900 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Makes sense.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.600 align:middle line:10%
And what's interesting, and
you and I talked about this off

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.330 align:middle line:10%
camera a minute beforehand,
is we're at a time now,

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.550 align:middle line:10%
where people are becoming--
people who are waking up,

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:20.350 align:middle line:10%
anyway--

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.060 align:middle line:10%
are becoming extremely concerned
about the quality of their food

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:10%
supplies.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.280 align:middle line:10%
We're talking
about denuded land.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.530 align:middle line:10%
It's just chemical-enhanced,
irradiated, you name it.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.160 align:middle line:10%
So we're not looking
at whole foods anymore.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:10%
And just recently,
I stumbled across,

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:10%
in one of the Waldorf
School Gardens, a man who

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:10%
is building on one of the
largest Waldorf School

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:10%
properties in the US,
building a perfect golden,

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:48.380 align:middle line:10%
meaning proportioned,
pyramid, glass sides,

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:10%
in which to actually--

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.020 align:middle line:10%
I think it's a type of
polymer, some kind of plastic

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.690 align:middle line:10%
that the sun passes
through with ease

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.790 align:middle line:10%
and still allows for
the nutrient absorption

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:00.880 align:middle line:10%
from the plants.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.452 align:middle line:84%
He's building a
perfect pyramid, and he

00:19:03.452 --> 00:19:05.660 align:middle line:84%
said the yields they're
getting out of these pyramids

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:06.800 align:middle line:90%
are unbelievable.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BURKE: Yes.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:84%
That was very
entertaining to hear.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.840 align:middle line:90%
I've always wondered about that.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.298 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I mean it seems like
that might be giving us hope

00:19:14.298 --> 00:19:17.190 align:middle line:10%
for how we can take
control of our own--

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.500 align:middle line:10%
the fertility of our own food
supply back into our own hands.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.149 align:middle line:84%
You can make these
things yourself.

00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BURKE: Yeah, I
was unaware of that.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And I am unaware
of any mechanism

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.530 align:middle line:90%
by which that could take place.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:30.987 align:middle line:90%
But data is data.

00:19:30.987 --> 00:19:32.320 align:middle line:90%
If he's doing that, then there--

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's saying the
yields are up to three times

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:37.287 align:middle line:84%
what you get by growing normally
in any other greenhouse.

00:19:37.287 --> 00:19:38.870 align:middle line:10%
>>BURKE: And that's
fascinating, then,

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:10%
because the kind of yield
increases we saw out

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:48.500 align:middle line:10%
of pyramids in South America,
these dolmen or stone chambers

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.022 align:middle line:10%
in the Northeast ran
two to three times.

00:19:51.022 --> 00:19:51.980 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's amazing.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:57.320 align:middle line:10%
I mean not only are we getting
a fresh new view of sacred sites

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.990 align:middle line:10%
and practical uses to
ancient civilizations here,

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:10%
but we might be--

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:01.610 align:middle line:10%
yes, go ahead.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.910 align:middle line:10%
>>BURKE: Yeah.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.310 align:middle line:10%
Well, I was going to say one
of the quotes in our book

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:09.140 align:middle line:10%
is from one of the more famous
Native American religious

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.710 align:middle line:10%
experts from the
University of Chicago.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.680 align:middle line:10%
And his statement that
we quote is simply

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.170 align:middle line:10%
that for the Native
Americans, there

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:22.540 align:middle line:10%
was no difference between the
physical and the spiritual,

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.970 align:middle line:10%
and that, furthermore,
the chief motive,

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:29.000 align:middle line:10%
the chief responsibility of
Native American religion,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.432 align:middle line:10%
at least in North America, was
to make the crops grow better.

00:20:34.432 --> 00:20:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and we need to make

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:37.750 align:middle line:90%
our crops grow better today.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BURKE: We've still
got the situation

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:43.780 align:middle line:84%
of a continually growing
population and food

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.420 align:middle line:84%
supply that's going to
be very hard to keep up

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.310 align:middle line:90%
with that population.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this
ancient technology,

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.420 align:middle line:84%
this wisdom that you've
stumbled across here,

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:84%
this finding may
very well be part

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.400 align:middle line:84%
of the salvation of our
being able to sustain

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.600 align:middle line:90%
our own cultures in the future.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.380 align:middle line:10%
>>BURKE: We'd be particularly
happy to see it used in Africa,

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:07.060 align:middle line:10%
especially sub-Saharan Africa,
because we make the biggest

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:10.300 align:middle line:10%
differences where there are
the biggest stress guard--

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.560 align:middle line:10%
the biggest stresses.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the biggest need

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:17.080 align:middle line:84%
is to find something
that can help

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.900 align:middle line:84%
farmers increase their
yields under extremely

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.400 align:middle line:90%
poor conditions.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And we have no patents
even pending in Africa.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.480 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be making
any money on this,

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.880 align:middle line:84%
but the company
would love to see

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.980 align:middle line:90%
that technology go that way.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.200 align:middle line:84%
It could be packed on the
back of a pickup truck,

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.850 align:middle line:84%
driven from village
to village, and you

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.210 align:middle line:84%
could treat an entire village's
seed in probably a day or two,

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:41.320 align:middle line:90%
and move on.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.615 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely fabulous.

00:21:42.615 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:90%
