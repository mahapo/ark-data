00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>If you've not
already done so, try

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.670 align:middle line:84%
to view Bruce Lipton's interview
prior to viewing this one.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.470 align:middle line:84%
These two often make their
presentations to the public

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.620 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Lipton's work
in cellular biology

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.890 align:middle line:84%
and our body's interface with
our deepest belief systems

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.150 align:middle line:84%
leads directly into
Rob Williams' work

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.960 align:middle line:84%
in reprogramming our
subconscious beliefs.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.570 align:middle line:84%
These are the beliefs that
essentially run our lives.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Like the operating
system of your computer,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.420 align:middle line:84%
sometimes these beliefs
corrupt our hard drives,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.780 align:middle line:84%
created illness, a
lack of joy, and more.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Williams came from
both a business background

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and a second career
as a psychoanalyst

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.600 align:middle line:84%
before coming to the
realization that there

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.940 align:middle line:84%
was a large piece of
the story missing.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.566 align:middle line:84%
Here he talks about that
important missing piece.

00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:51.650 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Question number one, what are
these subconscious beliefs?

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Where do these
subconscious beliefs

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:84%
come from-- before we
talk about how we're

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:84%
going to relieve
ourselves of them--

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.270 align:middle line:84%
and how do they actually affect
the programming of our bodies

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:84%
as well as, obviously,
our psychology in life?

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.514 align:middle line:84%
Largely they come
from our childhood.

00:01:13.514 --> 00:01:15.680 align:middle line:84%
That's where, at a period
from the time you're born,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.138 align:middle line:84%
in fact prior to
when you're born--

00:01:17.138 --> 00:01:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Bruce spoke about that
aspect of in utero training.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.580 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of nature's
head start program

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.612 align:middle line:84%
when you're interacting with
the world of your mother,

00:01:25.612 --> 00:01:27.820 align:middle line:84%
because you're carried for
nine months in that world,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.540 align:middle line:84%
and you can start to
pick up what reality

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:84%
is going to be like when
you come out of the womb.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And then from that
moment on, the programs

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.500 align:middle line:84%
continue literally for
the rest of your life.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that
really count the most

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.640 align:middle line:84%
are from about that time
when you show up in the world

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.240 align:middle line:84%
and take your first breath
and about six years old,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.630 align:middle line:90%
five, six years old.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.290 align:middle line:84%
That's a highly programmable
time as far as brains go.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.140 align:middle line:84%
We just take in information
as kids like little sponges.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Reality is just
everything around us.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And if the authority
figures, which in that case

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.715 align:middle line:84%
usually represent your parents,
they tell you something,

00:01:59.715 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:90%
you don't even question it.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you don't even have the
brain capacity to question it.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.990 align:middle line:84%
You just take it in,
assume it's true,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:84%
and start operating out of
this set of perceptions,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.539 align:middle line:90%
this reality.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And actually, in
your childhood that

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.297 align:middle line:84%
may serve you very
well, especially if you

00:02:13.297 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:84%
get old enough to
talk about it later,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.850 align:middle line:84%
which means you
survived your child.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
So the beliefs are very
useful in childhood

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.660 align:middle line:84%
but maybe not necessarily
so useful later on

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.150 align:middle line:84%
when maybe you outgrow them
and your environment changes

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.600 align:middle line:84%
and what you learned as a
child as survival and coping

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.810 align:middle line:84%
mechanisms is now
really something that's

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.610 align:middle line:84%
in your way, something
that detracts

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.930 align:middle line:90%
from your life as an adult.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.680 align:middle line:84%
So most of the programs
are installed very early

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.940 align:middle line:90%
in childhood.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>And this really becomes, more
or less, a filter, as you say,

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.200 align:middle line:84%
to how you view the
rest of your life

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and your perceptions of
the world around you?

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.680 align:middle line:84%
If you think of yourself
as a camera, as an example,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.682 align:middle line:84%
and reality is out
there and your camera's

00:02:49.682 --> 00:02:51.140 align:middle line:84%
going to take a
picture of reality,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.306 align:middle line:84%
well, if you didn't have
any filters on your camera,

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:56.000 align:middle line:84%
you'd take a picture of exactly
what reality looked like.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.850 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is almost
no one can take that picture

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.320 align:middle line:84%
without the filter part,
which is in between the camera

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:90%
itself and reality.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So you see reality
through a set of filters,

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and those filters I just
call belief systems.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.590 align:middle line:84%
They're things that
totally color what you see.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.960 align:middle line:84%
The notion of seeing the world
through rose-colored glasses,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.860 align:middle line:84%
it's a cliche maybe
and a metaphor,

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.380 align:middle line:84%
but the reality is if you have
a set of beliefs they're just

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.610 align:middle line:90%
like a prescription for glasses.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.350 align:middle line:84%
When you look out through the
world, you see not the world

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.190 align:middle line:84%
You see yourself through
the world the way

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.720 align:middle line:84%
you've been
programmed to see it.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's your reality.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>So most of us
are really a result

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.350 align:middle line:84%
of, to one degree or another,
unconscious parenting.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's as unconscious
as their parents

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.081 align:middle line:84%
were and the
parents before them.

00:03:45.081 --> 00:03:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>For people who are
thinking, gosh, my parents

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.910 align:middle line:84%
are my problem, they
really messed me up,

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and if only I could just now
get back at my parents, no.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:90%
It's pointless, for one thing.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, you would
have to go back all the way

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.520 align:middle line:84%
to the very first cell
that ever divided,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.353 align:middle line:84%
because you can explain
why your parents got

00:04:01.353 --> 00:04:04.280 align:middle line:84%
to be the way they are if you
follow the software being,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.007 align:middle line:84%
essentially, transferred from
generation to generation.

00:04:07.007 --> 00:04:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And eventually what happens
is you end up with it.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And the big deal is
that can be stopped

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.230 align:middle line:84%
at any particular
generation with what we now

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.910 align:middle line:84%
know about beliefs and
how to change them.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.505 align:middle line:90%
>>And this is your specialty.

00:04:18.505 --> 00:04:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
you for a minute

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and how you came upon
this career path that

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:90%
is helping so many people now.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I didn't start
this way, that's for sure.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I was just like most
other the people in the United

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.740 align:middle line:84%
States with the family
interested in making a living

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.430 align:middle line:90%
and providing for my family.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I did that through
the corporate world

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.871 align:middle line:84%
here in the United States in
several different iterations

00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:44.370 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.800 align:middle line:84%
But the last one was in
the television business,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.810 align:middle line:84%
actually in the cable
television business.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.332 align:middle line:84%
I was general manager for
a cable television company.

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:53.040 align:middle line:84%
It was communications,
but not exactly, I

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.060 align:middle line:84%
think, what I was ultimately
trying to be interested in

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:90%
and to do.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a point at
which I arrived emotionally

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.936 align:middle line:84%
and spiritually where
that version of me

00:05:04.936 --> 00:05:06.310 align:middle line:84%
just didn't fit
anymore and there

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.760 align:middle line:84%
was a sort of
spiritual emergence.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.470 align:middle line:84%
I had to move out
of that environment

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.097 align:middle line:84%
in order to do what I
knew I was here to do.

00:05:13.097 --> 00:05:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
exactly what it was.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.230 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that
wasn't the endpoint.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.250 align:middle line:84%
So I had a kind of movement
out of that whole industry

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
into a deep need to make more
of a difference in the world.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.605 align:middle line:84%
And so I left that
corporate environment

00:05:27.605 --> 00:05:29.860 align:middle line:90%
and went into psychotherapy.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
There's no logical connection
there, except for moving out

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.670 align:middle line:84%
of one environment and
into something else,

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
birthing myself into
something that almost

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.615 align:middle line:84%
felt like the opposite of
my corporate environment.

00:05:38.615 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:84%
The corporate environment
really felt more

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.940 align:middle line:84%
like I was a cog in a wheel,
just sort of a meaningless

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.050 align:middle line:84%
was piece of machinery and that
I could be easily replaced.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't feel as a human
being that that was right,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.520 align:middle line:84%
that that's the
way we really are.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I moved into
this other profession.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.160 align:middle line:84%
In the process of
doing that, there

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.700 align:middle line:84%
was an enormous series
of very real transitions,

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.567 align:middle line:84%
very painful, difficult
times, actually.

00:06:04.567 --> 00:06:05.900 align:middle line:90%
But I can look back on that now.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.330 align:middle line:84%
I have no regrets whatsoever
about the difficulty of that

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.292 align:middle line:84%
because of what I
get to do now, which

00:06:11.292 --> 00:06:13.000 align:middle line:84%
is the most precious
thing I can imagine,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and that is being partnered
with other people that

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.370 align:middle line:84%
want to become the best version
of themselves that they can be.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>And were you finding that
traditional psychotherapy

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.460 align:middle line:90%
was lacking?

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>Enormously.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.574 align:middle line:90%
I went to graduate school.

00:06:25.574 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, what I got
out of graduate school

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.690 align:middle line:84%
was and advanced
degree in counseling.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.500 align:middle line:84%
I wished I'd gotten more of
an education in counseling.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.500 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out it was much
more of the old paradigm

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:84%
than where we are now, built
much more on the process

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.300 align:middle line:90%
itself was the whole business.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.540 align:middle line:90%
That was what was functional.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.460 align:middle line:90%
That's what you should do.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And one of my
professors actually

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.797 align:middle line:84%
said, well, Rob, you
should be in therapy

00:06:48.797 --> 00:06:49.880 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a good thing.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:51.970 align:middle line:90%
Just to do it.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.007 align:middle line:84%
And I, coming from a
business background,

00:06:55.007 --> 00:06:56.590 align:middle line:84%
always felt like,
well, wait a minute.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.400 align:middle line:90%
How about the results?

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.430 align:middle line:84%
How about the time when
you accomplish something,

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.929 align:middle line:84%
there's an endpoint, and then
you move on to something else?

00:07:01.929 --> 00:07:05.160 align:middle line:84%
There was no such point in
traditional mainstream therapy.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.990 align:middle line:84%
There was only the
continuation of this activity

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.640 align:middle line:90%
called psychotherapy.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.590 align:middle line:90%
So I was at odds with myself.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.300 align:middle line:84%
I had this results-oriented
business background,

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and I had a
process-oriented education.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And the reconciliation
turns out to be the work

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.790 align:middle line:84%
that I do now, the
PSYCH-K work, because it

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.540 align:middle line:84%
is highly
results-oriented but has

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.830 align:middle line:84%
a deep sense of
profound connection

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.095 align:middle line:84%
and respect for people
that I work with.

00:07:32.095 --> 00:07:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>And the segue between the
two, as I understand it,

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.300 align:middle line:84%
was this mysterious medical
artform known as kinesiology.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.016 align:middle line:90%
--call it.

00:07:41.016 --> 00:07:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, kinesiology is
just one small aspect

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.840 align:middle line:84%
of PSYCH-K. Actually, it's
the communication piece.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.450 align:middle line:84%
It's the thing that links you
up to your subconscious mind,

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.570 align:middle line:84%
where really all the
power and the action is.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And kinesiology
hadn't been used much

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.000 align:middle line:84%
at all in the
psychological realm

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.496 align:middle line:84%
but much more so if you
went to see a chiropractor

00:07:57.496 --> 00:07:59.860 align:middle line:84%
or you went to see a
nutritionist or somebody who

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.200 align:middle line:84%
was using it to access
information that was more

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.510 align:middle line:90%
on a physical level.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.330 align:middle line:84%
The psychological use
is quite different.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>Explain what that piece is.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Because didn't you have
an experience with it

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.650 align:middle line:84%
that you thought, hmm, this
isn't making sense, that

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.220 align:middle line:84%
kind of spurred you on to
learn more about the body's

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.030 align:middle line:84%
subconscious information
that it retains?

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, what happened to me is
I got introduced in kinesiology

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.260 align:middle line:84%
through a discipline called
educational kinesiology,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.190 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful discipline
designed, really,

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.789 align:middle line:84%
to help eradicate learning
disabilities in children.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And my bent in life wasn't
just eradicating disabilities

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.122 align:middle line:84%
in children, although it's
an admirable honorable goal,

00:08:38.122 --> 00:08:39.538 align:middle line:84%
but it was
psycho-spiritual growth

00:08:39.538 --> 00:08:41.169 align:middle line:84%
and accelerating that
in as many people

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:42.760 align:middle line:90%
on the planet as possible.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And so when I saw
the kinesiology work,

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.455 align:middle line:84%
I saw muscle testing work,
I was very confused by it.

00:08:48.455 --> 00:08:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I'd never seen anything
like it at all,

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.700 align:middle line:90%
and I was highly skeptical.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.512 align:middle line:84%
So it took quite a while for me
to be convinced of its efficacy

00:08:54.512 --> 00:08:56.470 align:middle line:84%
that it actually could
work and it was actually

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.710 align:middle line:84%
tapping into a part
of me that could make

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.130 align:middle line:84%
a difference in my physiology
and my behavior and so on.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.760 align:middle line:84%
But when I finally
got to that point,

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.220 align:middle line:84%
it was revelatory,
because at that point

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I saw how it fit into
what I wanted to do,

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.960 align:middle line:84%
in terms of accelerating
psycho-spiritual growth.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a communication system.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>>So just take a
moment, if you would,

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.540 align:middle line:84%
to briefly explain what it
is for people who have never

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:84%
heard of the word
kinesiology before we go on

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.760 align:middle line:84%
to talk about how this
communication system plays

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.850 align:middle line:90%
into what you do.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are lots of
forms of kinesiology,

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:26.570 align:middle line:84%
so it's not quite
as straightforward

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.970 align:middle line:84%
an answer as I
suspect you'd like.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.979 align:middle line:84%
It turns out applied kinesiology
is one version of it,

00:09:31.979 --> 00:09:34.270 align:middle line:84%
and that was really the father
of all the kinesiologies

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.940 align:middle line:84%
in the United States, and
that was used primarily

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:37.740 align:middle line:90%
by chiropractors.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.351 align:middle line:84%
But out of that grew lots
of forms of kinesiology.

00:09:41.351 --> 00:09:43.350 align:middle line:84%
If you look in the
dictionary under kinesiology,

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.260 align:middle line:84%
you'll find the study
of muscle movement.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not exactly
the way it's used,

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.860 align:middle line:84%
but that's the technical
description of it.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.840 align:middle line:84%
It's used, more or
less, for communication

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.980 align:middle line:84%
with the subconscious mind,
with what some people call

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.590 align:middle line:90%
the wisdom of the body.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And in PSYCH-K, it's used
directly with communication

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.440 align:middle line:84%
with the subconscious
to find out

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.880 align:middle line:84%
if beliefs that you're
holding are desirable.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.500 align:middle line:84%
People are like,
gee, most of us have

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.810 align:middle line:84%
read lots of self-help books
and taken lots of training

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and really got pretty much
smarter over the years,

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.790 align:middle line:84%
if we've paid attention to
our lives and the lessons

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.020 align:middle line:84%
that life teachers and that
other people who are teachers

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:18.900 align:middle line:90%
teach us.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And yet somehow
what I noticed was

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.610 align:middle line:84%
there's often a huge
gap between your wisdom

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.200 align:middle line:90%
and what your life looks like.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>And that's where the
changing of beliefs comes in.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.205 align:middle line:90%
So what is kinesiology?

00:10:33.205 --> 00:10:35.050 align:middle line:90%
How does it function?

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.200 align:middle line:90%
What does it look like?

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the short name for
kinesiology is muscle testing.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually a fairly
straightforward process.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.240 align:middle line:84%
It's done in lots
of different ways,

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.820 align:middle line:84%
but a simple example would
be if I put my arm out

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and have another person
pressing gently down on my arm

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.320 align:middle line:84%
while I'm pushing up
against their pressure,

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.630 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious mind has
to send an electrical signal

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.610 align:middle line:84%
to my muscles set, in this
case the muscles of my left arm

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.680 align:middle line:84%
here, to make sure that I
can maintain the pressure up

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.250 align:middle line:90%
against the pressure going down.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I go into
conflict, as an example,

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:04.910 align:middle line:84%
that signal is
reduced dramatically.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And when so, even with the same
amount of pressure downward,

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.480 align:middle line:84%
I have no longer the ability
to resist that pressure,

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.570 align:middle line:90%
so my arm goes down.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, it's setting
up a communication system

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.290 align:middle line:84%
that lets you know if
an idea that you're

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:84%
holding in your
mind stresses you.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.136 align:middle line:84%
You can also use
it with something

00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:20.730 align:middle line:84%
called self-referential
statements.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.720 align:middle line:84%
That's a fancy word for
things I think about myself.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.740 align:middle line:84%
So if I say my name is
Rob and somebody tests me,

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.120 align:middle line:84%
as long as my subconscious
mind is aligned with that name

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.800 align:middle line:84%
as being my name, I'll
maintain a strong response.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.550 align:middle line:84%
But if I try to get
away with lying,

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:37.690 align:middle line:84%
if I say my name is
Regina and I press down,

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.109 align:middle line:84%
and if I'm really
concentrating on being Regina,

00:11:40.109 --> 00:11:41.900 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see
weakness in my response

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:42.774 align:middle line:90%
rather than strength.

00:11:42.774 --> 00:11:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Because my subconscious
mind has to do two things.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.890 align:middle line:84%
It checks its files, just
like in a computer, for name,

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:50.390 align:middle line:90%
and the name file crashes.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And also, in this case, the
gender file would crash.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.789 align:middle line:84%
So the weak response is actually
created by a weakened signal.

00:11:55.789 --> 00:11:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Really we shouldn't
call it muscle testing.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.150 align:middle line:90%
We should call it mind testing.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>So now let this take
us forward to beliefs

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and using this as
one of the tools

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.250 align:middle line:84%
that you use to reveal
the hidden beliefs that

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.050 align:middle line:84%
are contained within
your entire being

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and reflected through
the muscle testing.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.360 align:middle line:84%
In a way, you can
reveal the beliefs.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.580 align:middle line:84%
In PSYCH-K, it's less
about revealing the beliefs

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.890 align:middle line:84%
as it is finding out
what you don't believe

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.840 align:middle line:84%
without necessarily knowing
what all those beliefs are.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.070 align:middle line:84%
The easy way to find out if this
particular discipline applies

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:31.870 align:middle line:84%
in your life is just
to look at your life.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Take a common sense
rational look and say, hmm,

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:90%
what's working?

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.630 align:middle line:90%
What's not working?

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And that will tell
you, maybe not

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:39.680 align:middle line:84%
in detail, what
your beliefs are.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.650 align:middle line:84%
But they'll tell where you have
life-enhancing, things that

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:45.070 align:middle line:84%
support what you want, and
life-sabotaging beliefs

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.540 align:middle line:90%
or life-limiting beliefs.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.760 align:middle line:84%
So take a couple of
examples that you've

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.600 align:middle line:84%
had through the years that were
really profound where you had

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.520 align:middle line:84%
this incongruency between
what the person thought

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.195 align:middle line:84%
they believed and what their
subconscious mind was playing

00:13:01.195 --> 00:13:03.410 align:middle line:84%
out and how it was
affecting their lives.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, simple things,
like thinking

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.460 align:middle line:84%
that you're capable of
influencing your world,

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.430 align:middle line:84%
saying I'm capable of
influencing my life,

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.870 align:middle line:84%
or I'm a positive thinking
person, or I believe in God,

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.572 align:middle line:84%
or I'm capable of standing
up in front of groups

00:13:17.572 --> 00:13:19.530 align:middle line:84%
and speaking, whatever
your belief is, whatever

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.450 align:middle line:84%
your desire is, whatever
your skills or desire is,

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.980 align:middle line:84%
you can formulate
a belief statement

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.925 align:middle line:90%
that affirms that that's true.

00:13:25.925 --> 00:13:27.550 align:middle line:84%
It may be true
consciously, by the way.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:29.133 align:middle line:84%
Because there's two
levels of beliefs.

00:13:29.133 --> 00:13:31.450 align:middle line:84%
There's conscious beliefs
and subconscious beliefs.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.652 align:middle line:84%
Conscious beliefs may
actually be completely

00:13:33.652 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:84%
different than your
subconscious beliefs.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's often
the case in life.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:42.340 align:middle line:84%
When people find themselves
aspiring to some goal

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.817 align:middle line:84%
and finding themselves
just sabotaging themselves

00:13:44.817 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:84%
right and left, usually
it's because there's

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.358 align:middle line:84%
a discrepancy between
their consciousness

00:13:48.358 --> 00:13:50.030 align:middle line:84%
desires and their
subconscious beliefs.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.560 align:middle line:84%
So with muscle
testing, you could

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.120 align:middle line:84%
affirm anything
you'd want out loud

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:90%
that would represent your goal.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:55.940 align:middle line:90%
We could muscle test that.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.590 align:middle line:84%
If the muscle response is
weak to your statement,

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:02.110 align:middle line:84%
we know you have at least one,
but probably more than one,

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.340 align:middle line:84%
self-sabotaging belief at
the subconscious level.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And then the PSYCH-K, which
is more than just the muscle

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.680 align:middle line:84%
testing, actually
moves in to connection

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.840 align:middle line:84%
with the subconscious,
offers it a variety of ways

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.730 align:middle line:84%
to make that change
to internalize

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.022 align:middle line:84%
the new and desirable belief,
in which case we do that.

00:14:19.022 --> 00:14:20.771 align:middle line:84%
And it generally only
takes a few minutes.

00:14:20.771 --> 00:14:22.650 align:middle line:84%
It sounds amazing, but
it's absolutely true.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:24.286 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, compared to a
lifetime of talk, yes,

00:14:24.286 --> 00:14:24.740 align:middle line:90%
it does sound amazing.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:25.482 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:14:25.482 --> 00:14:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know it has a lot
to do with the processing

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.507 align:middle line:84%
capacity of the subconscious
compared to the conscious mind.

00:14:30.507 --> 00:14:32.590 align:middle line:84%
As an example, what we're
learning in neuroscience

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:37.360 align:middle line:84%
is that conscious mind processes
roughly 40 bits of information

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.000 align:middle line:90%
per second.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.480 align:middle line:84%
If you think of this
in computer jargon,

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.230 align:middle line:84%
this'll make a little
bit of sense to you.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.900 align:middle line:90%
So 40.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Think of 40 bits of
information for a second.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Now compare that
to the subconscious

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.570 align:middle line:84%
mind, 40 million bits of
information, a million to one.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.472 align:middle line:90%
In other words a million times--

00:14:52.472 --> 00:14:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>Everything that it's sense.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.150 align:middle line:90%
It senses all this information.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:56.810 align:middle line:84%
It can also
manipulate information

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.520 align:middle line:84%
a million times faster
than the conscious mind.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So no wonder it's taken
so long in the last 30,

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.550 align:middle line:84%
40 years in sort of mainstream
psychotherapy operating

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:84%
at the conscious
level to make changes.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.450 align:middle line:84%
For heaven's sake, we've been
looking in the wrong place.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:12.850 align:middle line:84%
We should have been paying
a lot more attention

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.780 align:middle line:84%
to the subconscious mind,
where all the power is,

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.289 align:middle line:84%
all the juice is,
and all capability

00:15:16.289 --> 00:15:18.330 align:middle line:84%
is, because it's even your
subconscious mind that

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.079 align:middle line:84%
holds the beliefs that
you want to change.

00:15:20.079 --> 00:15:23.520 align:middle line:84%
So PSYCH-K is a discipline
that gives you access directly

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.390 align:middle line:90%
to your subconscious mind.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.390 align:middle line:84%
You're essentially
finding out what

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.100 align:middle line:90%
the readout is at that level.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you do,
if you have beliefs

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:32.870 align:middle line:84%
that are no longer
serving you, who you are

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.630 align:middle line:84%
or who you're
becoming, those are

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.456 align:middle line:90%
readily available to change.

00:15:36.456 --> 00:15:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>Now talk about how
your beliefs then

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:45.170 align:middle line:84%
are influencing what happens
in your body by way of dis-ease

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.170 align:middle line:84%
and how you would go about
approaching that when

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:84%
you have something
that is a very

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.047 align:middle line:84%
seriously worrying
type of condition.

00:15:53.047 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>So you're talking about worry
as in anxiety about something?

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>No, I'm talking
physical, something

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.090 align:middle line:84%
that's a significant enough
condition you're thinking,

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:01.340 align:middle line:84%
all right, I don't want to
just take a pill for it.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.810 align:middle line:84%
I really want to approach
it from a deeper level.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:06.100 align:middle line:90%
How does that look?

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.046 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, it looks like a field
called psychoneuroimmunology,

00:16:09.046 --> 00:16:10.420 align:middle line:84%
but I'll break
that down for you.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.160 align:middle line:90%
That's the mind/body connection.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.180 align:middle line:84%
That's where your mind
and your perception

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.070 align:middle line:84%
actually turn into
biological response, chemical

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.560 align:middle line:90%
response in your body.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And what this field
of study has learned--

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.987 align:middle line:84%
and it's been in this country
for about 40-some years now,

00:16:23.987 --> 00:16:25.570 align:middle line:84%
so there's actually
a lot of research.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:27.130 align:middle line:84%
You don't see it
in the mainstream,

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:30.090 align:middle line:84%
but there are thousands
of research projects

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.880 align:middle line:84%
that have been done
showing that there's

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:84%
this definite connection
between perception and biology--

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.690 align:middle line:84%
and what some of that shows is
that a disease process-- let's

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.730 align:middle line:84%
take cancer as an
example-- may have

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:84%
a very specific personality
profile of people

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.920 align:middle line:90%
who tend to get cancer.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not a genetic thing, as
Bruce said in his presentation,

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.882 align:middle line:84%
but what it is is
a perceptual thing.

00:16:51.882 --> 00:16:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And those perceptions, remember,
are handed down generation

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.070 align:middle line:90%
after generation.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.140 align:middle line:84%
That's what crosses
generational gaps is

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.500 align:middle line:90%
how you perceive the world.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So cancer patients,
for instance,

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:01.906 align:middle line:84%
one of the salient
features of cancer patients

00:17:01.906 --> 00:17:05.609 align:middle line:84%
is long-held anger and
resentment unexpressed.

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle line:84%
So when you hold
anger in your body,

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:84%
even though the anger may be
about someone else or about

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.411 align:middle line:84%
some other circumstances
outside of yourself,

00:17:13.411 --> 00:17:15.369 align:middle line:84%
that's not the part that
responds to the anger.

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:18.280 align:middle line:84%
If you hold it
inside, you're the one

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.759 align:middle line:84%
that experiences what you
may wish somebody else were

00:17:20.759 --> 00:17:23.300 align:middle line:84%
experiencing, if it's somebody
you're angry at that's somehow

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.170 align:middle line:84%
violated you or
betrayed you in some way

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.650 align:middle line:90%
and you're angry at them.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:27.819 align:middle line:90%
Anger's an odd thing.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:30.319 align:middle line:84%
It's like drinking poison and
then waiting for somebody else

00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:30.930 align:middle line:90%
to die.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.930 align:middle line:90%
You've got to get rid of it.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And so the beauty of that
is you can actually do that.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.060 align:middle line:84%
You can change your
beliefs in a way that

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.500 align:middle line:84%
allows you to express your
anger in appropriate ways

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't stay
inside you, turn

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:84%
into chemistry that's what's
called an immune suppressor,

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.187 align:middle line:84%
literally suppresses your
immune system's capacity

00:17:49.187 --> 00:17:51.020 align:middle line:84%
to handle the cancer
cells that are produced

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.670 align:middle line:84%
all the time in
the physical body.

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Cancer cells are always
in everybody's body,

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.450 align:middle line:84%
but if your immune
system's working properly

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:58.910 align:middle line:90%
it's not a problem.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:02.120 align:middle line:84%
When it's not, when
the system's capability

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.480 align:middle line:84%
to handle those cells
is reduced sufficiently,

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.055 align:middle line:84%
then opportunistic organisms
like cancer can show up.

00:18:08.055 --> 00:18:10.427 align:middle line:84%
>>So have you worked with
cases where the cancer has

00:18:10.427 --> 00:18:13.480 align:middle line:84%
been reversed by deprogramming
the subconscious mind?

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Does that then deprogram
the physiological response?

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.240 align:middle line:84%
There is a direct correlation
between the expression

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.824 align:middle line:84%
in the body and
the belief systems.

00:18:21.824 --> 00:18:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I have had experience
with cancer patients,

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.039 align:middle line:84%
with people who have
tumors that went away,

00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:84%
people that have had
all manner of disease.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Crohn's disease is
another, supposedly

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:31.430 align:middle line:90%
an incurable disease.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:32.400 align:middle line:90%
Not the case.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.500 align:middle line:84%
What's incurable is our
attitude that these things

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.404 align:middle line:90%
are incurable.

00:18:37.404 --> 00:18:38.820 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be
the toughest part

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.140 align:middle line:84%
is people say, well,
you can't cure this,

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and then that becomes
a belief system.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.358 align:middle line:84%
And in mainstream medicine,
that's a belief system that is,

00:18:45.358 --> 00:18:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I think, inadvertently
but I'm unnecessarily

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.010 align:middle line:84%
perpetrated by
authority figures.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:52.552 align:middle line:84%
And then people just
internalize that

00:18:52.552 --> 00:18:54.926 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, I guess if the
doctor says it's incurable,

00:18:54.926 --> 00:18:55.460 align:middle line:90%
it must be.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.960 align:middle line:84%
That's the same as
a death sentence.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you, say,
had belief systems

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.840 align:middle line:84%
that you were born
into through family

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and that you have reinforced
with your own experience

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.900 align:middle line:84%
in life, it's taken a
long time for your being

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.430 align:middle line:84%
to come to some of these
beliefs that have created,

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.170 align:middle line:84%
for example this kind
of anger, now it's

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:84%
expressing itself
in cancer, you say

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.340 align:middle line:84%
that you can go in and
reprogram the subconscious

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.020 align:middle line:90%
mind in minutes literally?

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:22.520 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>>How does that work?

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>Because we're not dealing with
mind in the normal Newtonian

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.340 align:middle line:90%
way of thinking about it.

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.250 align:middle line:84%
We've developed psychologies
around parts in my head.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.130 align:middle line:84%
There's my mother part
and my father part

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and the child part and the
teenager part and all that.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:84%
We've anthropomorphized
what really is the case.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not a Newtonian
world in our head.

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a quantum world.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And that quantum
world means that it's

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.390 align:middle line:90%
energy we're dealing with.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.810 align:middle line:84%
You don't have little Kodak
moments stuck in your head.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:50.980 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to go in and
find the pictures, anymore

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.313 align:middle line:84%
than you would look in a
computer and find the documents

00:19:53.313 --> 00:19:56.100 align:middle line:84%
that you see represented
as icons on your desktop.

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.110 align:middle line:84%
The truth is they're
really photons

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:84%
of light, energy held in
certain configurations.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:01.800 align:middle line:90%
Those are the memories.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And so what you do
is with kinesiology

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.570 align:middle line:90%
you can access the subconscious.

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:07.930 align:middle line:84%
You can deal directly with
it in a universal language

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:08.940 align:middle line:90%
of connection.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.559 align:middle line:84%
You can then rewrite
the software,

00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:11.850 align:middle line:90%
just like you would a computer.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.090 align:middle line:84%
The computer doesn't care
what software is in there.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.173 align:middle line:84%
You just need to know how
to operate the computer.

00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:20.270 align:middle line:84%
PSYCH-K's like an owner's
manual for your brain.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>>So let's talk about how much
of the subconscious versus

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.530 align:middle line:84%
the conscious, is it
something like 95%--

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Bruce was saying something like
95% of what we think we believe

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.040 align:middle line:84%
or what we actually believe
and our body is carrying is

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.570 align:middle line:90%
actually subconscious then.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely true.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the most outrageous number
carefully kept as a secret.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:40.900 align:middle line:84%
It seems that
hardly anybody knows

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.720 align:middle line:84%
this, that anywhere
from 95% to 99%

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.560 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
our awareness is not

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.210 align:middle line:84%
conscious at the
conscious level.

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:50.644 align:middle line:84%
It's subconscious,
below the level

00:20:50.644 --> 00:20:53.060 align:middle line:84%
of your conscious awareness,
which means most of our lives

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.580 align:middle line:90%
are being run on autopilot.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.270 align:middle line:84%
We're more stimulus
response machines.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Something happens
in the environment,

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.170 align:middle line:84%
signals something to
us, we interpret it

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.810 align:middle line:84%
based on our belief systems,
and we do it subconsciously.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:04.226 align:middle line:84%
And then by the
time we get around

00:21:04.226 --> 00:21:07.330 align:middle line:84%
to actually taking action and we
think that action is conscious,

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:09.796 align:middle line:84%
it's as if you sort of
jump on the bandwagon

00:21:09.796 --> 00:21:11.420 align:middle line:84%
at the very last
minute thinking you've

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.920 align:middle line:84%
determined where
you're going to go.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.930 align:middle line:84%
The determination's
already been made.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>>So with PSYCH-K,
you go in, and you're

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:19.510 align:middle line:84%
able, through the tools
such as kinesiology,

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.082 align:middle line:84%
to determine what
your actual belief

00:21:21.082 --> 00:21:22.290 align:middle line:90%
systems are within the being.

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>Correct.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>And then you're able to
help make a shift within that.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.745 align:middle line:90%
>>Right, yes.

00:21:27.745 --> 00:21:30.245 align:middle line:84%
>>And then you're able to test
afterwards and get validation

00:21:30.245 --> 00:21:32.290 align:middle line:84%
that that shift has
actually occurred?

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.290 align:middle line:84%
What I love about
it is that you get

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.880 align:middle line:84%
to use a physical
process like kinesiology,

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.137 align:middle line:84%
an objective measure
of a subject of change.

00:21:40.137 --> 00:21:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't really see the
change going on in somebody's

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.494 align:middle line:84%
mind, but you can
see the effect.

00:21:44.494 --> 00:21:46.660 align:middle line:84%
It's really not that different
than quantum physics.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.800 align:middle line:84%
They'll show you the beginning
part and an end part,

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.466 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of it
is kind of a mystery.

00:21:50.466 --> 00:21:51.502 align:middle line:90%
It's all hypothesis.

00:21:51.502 --> 00:21:54.085 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to see the middle
part, what's actually going on

00:21:54.085 --> 00:21:55.860 align:middle line:84%
in the mind during the change,
because it doesn't have

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.068 align:middle line:84%
anything to do with the fact
that it's going to work.

00:21:58.068 --> 00:21:59.580 align:middle line:84%
But you need to
test that it worked.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>So the notion
that you need to be

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:05.040 align:middle line:84%
aware of all of the factors
that have brought you down

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.510 align:middle line:84%
to this point is
really not true then.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.252 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go
over it cognitively?

00:22:09.252 --> 00:22:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, see, that's
the difference.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.800 align:middle line:84%
You do have to be aware,
but not cognitively.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
beautiful statement.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.549 align:middle line:84%
The part of you that has to
know what those programs are

00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:90%
is the subconscious part.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And by definition,
that's below the level

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.210 align:middle line:90%
of your conscious awareness.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Consciously no,
most of the time you

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.204 align:middle line:84%
don't need to know anything
about dragging yourself back

00:22:25.204 --> 00:22:27.703 align:middle line:84%
through your childhood and going
through who do what to whom

00:22:27.703 --> 00:22:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and who should blame or
forgive and all that stuff.

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:30.451 align:middle line:90%
Irrelevant.

00:22:30.451 --> 00:22:32.366 align:middle line:84%
You're dealing directly
with the subconscious.

00:22:32.366 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:84%
The information is
stored in files, just

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:35.300 align:middle line:90%
like in your computer.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.126 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to read every
document before you delete it.

00:22:38.126 --> 00:22:39.500 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
change it, you may

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.895 align:middle line:84%
have to edit it a little
bit, and we do that sometimes

00:22:41.895 --> 00:22:43.180 align:middle line:90%
in PSYCH-K as well.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.400 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part, all that
remains at the subconscious

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.090 align:middle line:90%
level, the effect is conscious.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.020 align:middle line:84%
That's what you see in
terms of the change.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And the good news is, once
again, you're doing all of this

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.030 align:middle line:84%
at 40 million bits of
information processing

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.300 align:middle line:90%
power per second.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.250 align:middle line:84%
That's why you can take beliefs
that have been with you for 30,

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:02.830 align:middle line:84%
40, 50 years and change them
in a matter of a few moments.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:06.657 align:middle line:84%
>>So you can go in and
make agreements or at least

00:23:06.657 --> 00:23:08.490 align:middle line:84%
determine whether or
not the subconscious is

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:12.150 align:middle line:84%
willing to make that
agreement to shift.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever run into situations
where the subconscious simply

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.540 align:middle line:84%
is not in agreement
and says do what

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:84%
you like but we like
it the way it is?

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>Not quite like that.

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.311 align:middle line:84%
There are times when
the subconscious

00:23:23.311 --> 00:23:25.382 align:middle line:90%
mind can't make the change.

00:23:25.382 --> 00:23:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't brought up the
subject yet of the other part

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.930 align:middle line:84%
of you that's involved
with all this.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:32.090 align:middle line:84%
That's your superconscious
mind, your higher self,

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:33.596 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual
component of PSYCH-K.

00:23:33.596 --> 00:23:34.095 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:34.095 --> 00:23:38.239 align:middle line:84%
And in PSYCH-K, one of
the key pieces of it

00:23:38.239 --> 00:23:40.530 align:middle line:84%
is somebody comes in and they
want to change something.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:41.860 align:middle line:84%
They've got some
disease process going on

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.568 align:middle line:84%
or some behavioral
problem, and they say,

00:23:43.568 --> 00:23:45.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
this way anymore.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.780 align:middle line:84%
What I learned a long time to
go through a very personal, very

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.590 align:middle line:84%
moving experience
that I had taught

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:53.440 align:middle line:84%
me don't judge people
by how they show up.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Don't judge them by what
they bring in as a symptom.

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Because from the
spiritual point of view,

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't really believe that
things happen accidentally.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.030 align:middle line:84%
I think everything has
purpose and meaning, including

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:06.080 align:middle line:84%
what looks like
disease, including

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.530 align:middle line:84%
what looks like
dysfunction or disability.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes a
disability is really

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.120 align:middle line:90%
an ability to do something else.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.995 align:middle line:84%
It has forced a
person into a way

00:24:13.995 --> 00:24:15.640 align:middle line:84%
of seeing life for
a way of being.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.600 align:middle line:84%
They never would have gone there
had they stayed in some sort

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.240 align:middle line:90%
of "normal," quote, unquote--

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>>The proverbial wake-up
call, as it were, oftentimes.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And some people seem to be
born with the wake-up call.

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.740 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you this story,
because this will, I think,

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.215 align:middle line:84%
exemplify perhaps
what I'm getting at.

00:24:31.215 --> 00:24:32.700 align:middle line:90%
It was so profound.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.110 align:middle line:84%
I was living in the city
at the time, a large city,

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:37.140 align:middle line:90%
and I lived near a high school.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was in my car, and I
had stopped at a red light,

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.300 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sitting at this
red light simply waiting

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.170 align:middle line:84%
for the light to change,
like you would do.

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.770 align:middle line:84%
In the crosswalk
come a bunch of kids,

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:50.910 align:middle line:84%
one adult from the area
of the high school,

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:55.800 align:middle line:84%
and they were kids that must've
been from a special ed class.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And so they had a couple
of Down Syndrome kids.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.170 align:middle line:90%
They had a one instructor.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.370 align:middle line:84%
They had two or three
kids in wheelchairs.

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:05.089 align:middle line:84%
And this one kid looked to
be about 15 years old or so,

00:25:05.089 --> 00:25:06.630 align:middle line:84%
and he was strapped
in the wheelchair

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.260 align:middle line:90%
because he was spastic.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.020 align:middle line:84%
So he was flailing
around like this.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.400 align:middle line:84%
His body, involuntarily
the muscles were moving.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And I watched him
as he went across.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And just in my own mind, the
privacy of my own thoughts,

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.322 align:middle line:84%
I looked at him and
I said in my mind,

00:25:19.322 --> 00:25:20.780 align:middle line:84%
jeez, thank you
God for not letting

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.440 align:middle line:90%
me have to live like that.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
I swear to you,

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.560 align:middle line:84%
this kid, who was going
like this, shot around

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.450 align:middle line:84%
and his eyes locked
on my eyes in the car.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And in silence, as if he
were sitting in the car,

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I heard in my head
don't feel sorry for me.

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:40.550 align:middle line:90%
I chose this body.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:43.350 align:middle line:90%
This is my last time here.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:44.677 align:middle line:90%
And I immediately was--

00:25:44.677 --> 00:25:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>You're giving me chills.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.630 align:middle line:90%
>>--just chilled.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.020 align:middle line:90%
And I said, namaste, master.

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.430 align:middle line:84%
My recognition of the divinity
in him and our connection--

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.550 align:middle line:84%
no longer would I
ever pity anybody

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.070 align:middle line:84%
who came to see me for
any possible reason.

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:59.210 align:middle line:84%
It was the most profound
experience and lesson

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.345 align:middle line:84%
that I needed at that
time in my career.

00:26:01.345 --> 00:26:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Because when people
came in, I thought,

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:04.880 align:middle line:84%
how unfortunate,
how bad, how this.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.470 align:middle line:90%
No, this was no accident.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And this was a being that no
longer needed the physical body

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.370 align:middle line:90%
to express in reality.

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:12.600 align:middle line:90%
It was his last time.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.920 align:middle line:90%
He was checking out.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.740 align:middle line:84%
He came in and chose
that experience

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.690 align:middle line:84%
so he didn't get preoccupied
with physicality.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:20.040 align:middle line:90%
It was a glorious experience.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.861 align:middle line:84%
>>And talk about the notion
of that connectedness,

00:26:22.861 --> 00:26:25.216 align:middle line:84%
that unconscious
superconscious connectedness

00:26:25.216 --> 00:26:26.415 align:middle line:90%
between the two of you.

00:26:26.415 --> 00:26:26.955 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:26:26.955 --> 00:26:27.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.050 align:middle line:90%
He was a master.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:30.270 align:middle line:84%
That's why I said
thank you, master.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:33.670 align:middle line:84%
It was an acknowledgement that
at that moment I had decided

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.839 align:middle line:84%
and he had decided to have
our consciousness cross paths.

00:26:36.839 --> 00:26:38.130 align:middle line:90%
Because that was a bifurcation.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:39.379 align:middle line:90%
That was a split point for me.

00:26:39.379 --> 00:26:40.997 align:middle line:84%
That was a learning
experience that he

00:26:40.997 --> 00:26:42.330 align:middle line:90%
could give me in that condition.

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:44.145 align:middle line:84%
And it was so profound
and so atypical.

00:26:44.145 --> 00:26:46.030 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't somebody
I was talking to who

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:48.490 align:middle line:84%
was disabled in a
wheelchair or something.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:51.590 align:middle line:84%
This was a complete
flash in my mind

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:54.996 align:middle line:84%
with this being so clear
to give me that message.

00:26:54.996 --> 00:26:56.120 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen him before.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.160 align:middle line:90%
He disappeared.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I was on stun-- somebody
beeped behind me

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.319 align:middle line:84%
to get the car to go--
because of the nature

00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:02.110 align:middle line:90%
of that experience.

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:04.070 align:middle line:84%
But from that point
on, I was always

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:06.690 align:middle line:84%
able to see through
the distortion

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:09.480 align:middle line:84%
of the physical presentation
to the divinity in the people I

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.630 align:middle line:84%
was working with, always
looked for the divine.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>So this is a good
time now to talk

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.260 align:middle line:84%
about the overlay of
the superconscious.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.550 align:middle line:84%
The superconscious mind
in this case in PSYCH-K

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:24.820 align:middle line:84%
provides a very, very important
protocol, if you will.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.520 align:middle line:84%
If someone comes and says,
I want to make a change,

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.650 align:middle line:84%
one of the steps you
have to go through

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:32.540 align:middle line:84%
in every PSYCH-K process
that will facilitate

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.760 align:middle line:84%
this sort of change is
to ask the subconscious

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.687 align:middle line:84%
if it's safe and appropriate
to make this particular change.

00:27:38.687 --> 00:27:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's wording
that's specific to that,

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.330 align:middle line:84%
but safe and appropriate
are the two key words there.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:44.840 align:middle line:84%
It means you're asking the
subconscious mind this question

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.966 align:middle line:84%
and using muscle testing
as a collaborative effort.

00:27:46.966 --> 00:27:48.881 align:middle line:84%
That's the way you can
get a physical response

00:27:48.881 --> 00:27:49.892 align:middle line:90%
from the superconscious.

00:27:49.892 --> 00:27:52.350 align:middle line:84%
You ask the superconscious mind
is it safe and appropriate,

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:54.460 align:middle line:84%
meaning it will bring
this person no harm,

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:55.360 align:middle line:90%
first and foremost.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.021 align:middle line:84%
Even if Hippocratic Oath
in medicine is do no harm.

00:27:58.021 --> 00:27:59.270 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that profoundly.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.120 align:middle line:84%
It's so important in PSYCH-K
and all of the healing work

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.404 align:middle line:84%
that healers and energy
workers are doing.

00:28:04.404 --> 00:28:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And the second one
is appropriate,

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.552 align:middle line:84%
meaning in the context of
your life, the big picture,

00:28:08.552 --> 00:28:10.760 align:middle line:84%
not just the small picture
of what you want right now

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.620 align:middle line:84%
and the wheel squeaking
and fix it doctor and make

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.380 align:middle line:90%
the symptom go away or it hurts.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.770 align:middle line:84%
This is, in the context
of your life path

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:20.510 align:middle line:84%
and contract here
as a human being,

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.032 align:middle line:90%
is this appropriate to do.

00:28:22.032 --> 00:28:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And so you're muscle testing
that for a yes or no response.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:26.364 align:middle line:84%
You've already set up
a communication system.

00:28:26.364 --> 00:28:27.470 align:middle line:90%
That's the kinesiology.

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:30.212 align:middle line:84%
But once you've made
this level of linkup,

00:28:30.212 --> 00:28:32.670 align:middle line:84%
you can get a direct response
through the subconscious that

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:34.910 align:middle line:84%
controls the muscle movement
from the superconscious that

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:36.940 align:middle line:84%
works with the subconscious
to give you that signal,

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and you can find out
whether this is even

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:39.730 align:middle line:90%
an appropriate thing to get.

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:41.620 align:middle line:90%
You know the cliche.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:42.800 align:middle line:90%
Be careful what you ask for.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:43.750 align:middle line:90%
You might get it.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.041 align:middle line:84%
And how many times have we
chased something, caught it,

00:28:46.041 --> 00:28:47.410 align:middle line:90%
and said, what was I thinking?

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:48.868 align:middle line:84%
>>And going through
this, your life

00:28:48.868 --> 00:28:51.320 align:middle line:84%
may be turned upside
down for a while.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.340 align:middle line:84%
But that is only in
cooperation with what

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.062 align:middle line:84%
is for your highest
good, you're saying?

00:28:55.062 --> 00:28:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>That's correct.

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:57.050 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
what you're going to do

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:58.890 align:middle line:84%
is necessarily going to
be comfortable or easy,

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:00.382 align:middle line:84%
but it does mean
it's appropriate,

00:29:00.382 --> 00:29:02.590 align:middle line:84%
and it does mean in the
[? belong pool, ?] it's safe.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.520 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm here to
learn life lessons,

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.150 align:middle line:84%
if my primary goal is really
a spiritual experience

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:10.100 align:middle line:84%
in human body form, I
want to stay on track.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:13.230 align:middle line:84%
I want to accelerate my personal
growth in the right direction.

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get distracted,
go down these little rivulets

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:17.213 align:middle line:84%
and bang into walls and
have to come back and find

00:29:17.213 --> 00:29:18.090 align:middle line:90%
the river again.

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:21.030 align:middle line:84%
I want to stay in the river,
and I want to stay in the flow.

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.500 align:middle line:84%
So this first question in
the permission protocols that

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.900 align:middle line:84%
PSYCH-K uses lets you
know whether this is even

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.390 align:middle line:84%
a worthwhile activity or whether
you should just say, hmm--

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>>Not yet.

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>--not yet or not now
or, yeah, you don't know,

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.010 align:middle line:90%
but you don't do it right then.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:34.960 align:middle line:84%
The second level
of connection, you

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.666 align:middle line:84%
get permission that's
superconscious,

00:29:36.666 --> 00:29:37.790 align:middle line:90%
commitment is subconscious.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:39.331 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious
mind's going to need

00:29:39.331 --> 00:29:41.980 align:middle line:84%
to carry out the actual
changing of the beliefs

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.941 align:middle line:84%
necessary to make
your new belief true.

00:29:43.941 --> 00:29:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And the commitment
statement is more

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.800 align:middle line:84%
like every part of this system,
meaning the mind/body system is

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.279 align:middle line:84%
ready, willing, and able
to make this change now,

00:29:52.279 --> 00:29:53.320 align:middle line:90%
ready, willing, and able.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.030 align:middle line:84%
If any part, any component that,
not ready or not willing or not

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:57.864 align:middle line:84%
able, any one of those
is not going to work,

00:29:57.864 --> 00:30:00.529 align:middle line:84%
you get to know ahead of time so
you don't waste your time going

00:30:00.529 --> 00:30:02.950 align:middle line:84%
through some meaningless
activity to make a change

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.160 align:middle line:90%
and then have it not work.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.390 align:middle line:84%
So it literally
works every time,

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:09.569 align:middle line:84%
because in the final
analysis the muscle testing

00:30:09.569 --> 00:30:10.860 align:middle line:90%
will let you know if it worked.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Because what it does is
downloads new potential

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:15.710 align:middle line:84%
in the form of a
new belief system,

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:17.370 align:middle line:84%
that if you choose
to actualize it

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:21.750 align:middle line:84%
you still have free will, even
though it's maybe 1% to 5%

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:22.290 align:middle line:90%
of the time.

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:25.140 align:middle line:84%
The last step in almost
all PSYCH-K activities

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.930 align:middle line:84%
is once the new potential is
downloaded via these processes

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:30.470 align:middle line:84%
in engaging the
subconscious mind

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:32.344 align:middle line:84%
and introducing a new
belief, it's volition.

00:30:32.344 --> 00:30:34.510 align:middle line:84%
You go back to your conscious
mind, and you say, OK.

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:36.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like getting
software in your computer.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.010 align:middle line:90%
I get a new software package.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.010 align:middle line:90%
I put it in my computer.

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:40.610 align:middle line:84%
A little icon shows
up on the desktop.

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:42.485 align:middle line:84%
Now if I just sit there
and look at that icon

00:30:42.485 --> 00:30:44.445 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, do your
stuff, go ahead, go ahead,

00:30:44.445 --> 00:30:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't do anything
and I'm whining about it, hey,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.691 align:middle line:84%
the problem isn't
the icon, is it?

00:30:48.691 --> 00:30:49.190 align:middle line:90%
It's me.

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:50.356 align:middle line:90%
I never clicked on the icon.

00:30:50.356 --> 00:30:51.950 align:middle line:90%
I never engaged the potential.

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.960 align:middle line:84%
So in PSYCH-K, the last
step is an action step.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.810 align:middle line:84%
You put your
potential into action.

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So personal
responsibility is key.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:59.850 align:middle line:90%
Action it is important.

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:03.490 align:middle line:84%
But now where you used to feel
a self-sabotaging kind of energy

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:05.367 align:middle line:84%
every time you try
to accomplish a goal,

00:31:05.367 --> 00:31:06.950 align:middle line:84%
instead of being
able to get your goal

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.600 align:middle line:84%
every manner of excuse
and problem would come up,

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and it just didn't
seem to work out,

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:14.390 align:middle line:84%
now you get internal support
where there was originally

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.260 align:middle line:90%
all this resistance.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>How can a person who
isn't near a practitioner

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:25.720 align:middle line:84%
of this type, for example, find
their way to their own answers?

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.710 align:middle line:90%
Is this possible?

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Is it always going
to work better

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.770 align:middle line:84%
in tandem with another
human being facilitating,

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:34.601 align:middle line:84%
or can we do this to a fair
extent even on our own?

00:31:34.601 --> 00:31:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>You can do it on your own, and
it's best learned in a group.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.776 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
the first immersion

00:31:39.776 --> 00:31:41.400 align:middle line:84%
in the notion of what
all this is about

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.164 align:middle line:84%
should be under the auspices
of a certified instructor.

00:31:44.164 --> 00:31:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And there are instructors
all over the country

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.020 align:middle line:90%
and now even in Europe.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So the idea here is
learn it properly.

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:55.660 align:middle line:84%
In that class, you'll be taught
some self-testing processes so

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.820 align:middle line:84%
that you can, in fact,
do it with yourself.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:01.450 align:middle line:84%
But even then, my best
advice is find a friend

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:04.220 align:middle line:84%
to share the information with
that can do the muscle testing

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:04.940 align:middle line:90%
process with you.

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.800 align:middle line:84%
It only takes a couple
minutes for a person

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.580 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to
muscle test properly.

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.040 align:middle line:84%
You have all the
instructions in it

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.540 align:middle line:84%
from that workshops
that you take.

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:13.140 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to
go down these sheets

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and just read right off the
sheets and do it step-by-step.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.952 align:middle line:84%
It's designed to be a
personal transformation.

00:32:17.952 --> 00:32:19.660 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to create
a situation where

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.535 align:middle line:84%
you have to go find
somebody who's an expert.

00:32:21.535 --> 00:32:22.930 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty of
that out there,

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and that's not
what this is about.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>So we're basically
all walking around,

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:32.800 align:middle line:84%
for the most part-- it's a
rare person, I would assume,

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.090 align:middle line:84%
that's walking around
without these sorts

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:37.380 align:middle line:90%
of internal conflicts going on.

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
disease, this is

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:43.980 align:middle line:84%
where our lack of peace
and harmony comes from.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really the
reprogramming of the one area

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.310 align:middle line:84%
that's going to change
all of this in our lives.

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:53.765 align:middle line:84%
Is this correct, or is that
too simplistic a statement?

00:32:53.765 --> 00:32:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>>A little too
simplistic, in the sense

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:56.806 align:middle line:84%
you can't be sure
that one area is

00:32:56.806 --> 00:32:58.320 align:middle line:90%
connected to all other areas.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.550 align:middle line:90%
Many times that is the case.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:01.970 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you may
have a health issue,

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:04.520 align:middle line:84%
but it turns out it's related
to your spiritual views,

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.260 align:middle line:90%
not directly related to health.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Many systems focus
on the symptom

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:10.910 align:middle line:90%
and pretend it's the cause.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:12.590 align:middle line:90%
It's almost never the cause.

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Almost always the
symptom is the messenger.

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:18.780 align:middle line:84%
The cause is you
interpreting the message.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>Have you ever
seen examples where

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:21.690 align:middle line:84%
people are bringing
forward something

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:23.450 align:middle line:84%
that sounds like what
we would classically

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:27.060 align:middle line:84%
refer to as an experience
from another place and time,

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.930 align:middle line:84%
spontaneously perchance, and
it's affecting what's going on

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:33.440 align:middle line:84%
and a belief system
held in this time?

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.420 align:middle line:84%
When I first got
into all this, I

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.140 align:middle line:84%
didn't know PSYCH-K. PSYCH-K
didn't happen till about 1988,

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and it was a series of
sort of cosmic downloads

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.430 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:44.810 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't me sitting
down thinking it all up.

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:47.540 align:middle line:84%
It was a series of patterns
over the course of about two

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:50.960 align:middle line:84%
or three months that literally
showed up in my head.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.660 align:middle line:84%
I went and typed them into my
computer, and then I read them,

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and then I practiced them
to find out if they worked.

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And they would do no
harm and would they

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.180 align:middle line:84%
be beneficial and all
that, I had no idea.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I'd never had an
experience like that.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.390 align:middle line:90%
>>A superconscious download.

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:01.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it was.

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:03.350 align:middle line:84%
In retrospect, now I
can say what it was.

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:04.950 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I hadn't
had any of those

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:07.230 align:middle line:84%
that I knew about or was
consciously aware of,

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and at that time
I didn't know what

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:10.564 align:middle line:90%
to do with the information.

00:34:10.564 --> 00:34:14.949 align:middle line:84%
But the point of it all
is that before PSYCH-K I

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:16.969 align:middle line:84%
started exploring
past life therapy-- it

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:19.040 align:middle line:84%
was very popular at the
time-- and also doing

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.030 align:middle line:90%
future progressions.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.139 align:middle line:90%
I

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Was doing hypnosis at the
time, so a friend of mine and I

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.730 align:middle line:84%
would regress ourselves
back to whenever

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:27.790 align:middle line:84%
and progress ourselves to,
perhaps, a version of ourselves

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:28.870 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was fascinating and very
interesting and educational.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And as far as my left
brain goes, so to speak,

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.780 align:middle line:84%
the why is this and how
is it and all of that,

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:42.280 align:middle line:84%
it was like mind
candy, very enjoyable.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.120 align:middle line:84%
But in the final analysis,
Regina, actually it

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.940 align:middle line:84%
boils down to I'm here
now this version of me,

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.980 align:middle line:84%
and that's connected
in both directions

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.270 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously to
other versions of me.

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And so when I do
the PSYCH-K work

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:57.270 align:middle line:84%
with myself, which I do
on a fairly regular basis,

00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:00.810 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm giving a gift to
future mes and previous mes

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:03.042 align:middle line:90%
from my point of view.

00:35:03.042 --> 00:35:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>And it sounds like you're
giving the gift to people

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:06.874 align:middle line:84%
so that they can
share with each other.

00:35:06.874 --> 00:35:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is perhaps
the most fabulous part of what

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:12.980 align:middle line:84%
you're doing is to
help people to learn

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.230 align:middle line:84%
to listen to their
own inner wisdom.

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like
your group of people

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:19.340 align:middle line:84%
is doing a beautiful job in
helping facilitate people

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.840 align:middle line:84%
to learn this and
share it with others.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>It's absolutely the case.

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.779 align:middle line:84%
The real gift I
get back is knowing

00:35:24.779 --> 00:35:27.070 align:middle line:84%
that other people are taking
responsibility and control

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:28.120 align:middle line:90%
of their own lives.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.950 align:middle line:84%
They've given up what I call
the plague of powerlessness,

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:32.610 align:middle line:84%
the notion that I
can't do anything,

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:34.730 align:middle line:84%
I have to go find some
expert to do it for me,

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:36.420 align:middle line:84%
that power's always
externalized.

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.490 align:middle line:84%
In psychological terms, we
call it the locus of control

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:40.490 align:middle line:90%
is externalized.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:43.890 align:middle line:84%
We want to re-internalize it
know, that guru means, gee,

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:45.300 align:middle line:90%
you are you.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.190 align:middle line:84%
The guru is inside
you, and look inside.

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:49.900 align:middle line:84%
That's the last
place most people

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.170 align:middle line:90%
think to look for wisdom.

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:54.310 align:middle line:84%
PSYCH-K is not a powerful
tool in and of itself.

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:55.740 align:middle line:90%
It has no indigenous power.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.660 align:middle line:84%
But what it does do
and where it has power

00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.115 align:middle line:84%
is in introducing you
to your own power,

00:36:00.115 --> 00:36:03.260 align:middle line:84%
re-introducing you to the
power that was always there

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:06.380 align:middle line:90%
and you've forgotten about it.

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Really, at its core, on a
global transformational level,

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:13.860 align:middle line:84%
PSYCH-K is accessing the last
frontier of freedom many of us

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.940 align:middle line:84%
have, no matter what
country you live in,

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and there it's the
frontier the mind.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:23.690 align:middle line:84%
That is not yet something that
can be legislated or imprisoned

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:25.780 align:middle line:84%
or controlled in
any significant way.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.490 align:middle line:84%
The last bit of
freedom is to recognize

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:30.570 align:middle line:84%
who we are as divine beings
having a human experience,

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
all the power is.

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.340 align:middle line:84%
If we go there and each
of us in our own way

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.945 align:middle line:84%
takes responsibility for
being the best we can be,

00:36:36.945 --> 00:36:39.644 align:middle line:84%
you never have to deliberately
talk to anybody else.

00:36:39.644 --> 00:36:41.310 align:middle line:84%
You just have to be
the best you can be.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.351 align:middle line:84%
These subconscious minds
we've been talking about

00:36:43.351 --> 00:36:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and superconscious minds have
created a benevolent conspiracy

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.340 align:middle line:84%
to let us out of prison, a
prison of our own making,

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:54.410 align:middle line:84%
of our own minds, and of the
enculturation process of fear.

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's what permeates
most of the planet right now.

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:00.694 align:middle line:84%
Fear will not only keep you in
a prison of your own thinking,

00:37:00.694 --> 00:37:02.360 align:middle line:84%
but it will suppress
your immune system,

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.590 align:middle line:84%
make you much more likely
to get diseases than before.

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:09.330 align:middle line:84%
So the best thing we can do
is to be the best we can be,

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:11.480 align:middle line:84%
and that's to clean up
your subconscious mind,

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.810 align:middle line:84%
come into a deep knowing
and understanding

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:15.260 align:middle line:84%
of who you are as
a divine being,

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.420 align:middle line:84%
and that your
power is limitless.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.695 align:middle line:84%
Once you get that,
we're all free.

00:37:19.695 --> 00:37:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>Anybody trying
to regulate this?

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:25.920 align:middle line:84%
