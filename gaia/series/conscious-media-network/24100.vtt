1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.240
<v Interviewer>Most of you have heard about</v>

2
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.127
the power of intention by now.

3
00:00:03.127 --> 00:00:05.421
Some of you have even created visioning boards,

4
00:00:05.421 --> 00:00:08.322
where you paste up images of the life you want to live.

5
00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:09.762
Some of you have probably even

6
00:00:09.762 --> 00:00:11.639
seen the results of your efforts.

7
00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.681
But for many, the images on the dream board remain elusive.

8
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:18.049
Hale Dwoskin, author of "The Sedona Method,"

9
00:00:18.049 --> 00:00:20.214
says that's because you must first release

10
00:00:20.214 --> 00:00:22.486
the self-limiting chat from your mind,

11
00:00:22.486 --> 00:00:24.182
so that it can really hear the messages

12
00:00:24.182 --> 00:00:26.059
you're wanting it to carry out.

13
00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:31.977 line:15% 
(smooth jazz keyboard)

14
00:00:35.023 --> 00:00:37.412
<v Interviewer>So, Hale at this time your name is</v>

15
00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:39.876
more or less synonymous with The Sedona Method,

16
00:00:39.876 --> 00:00:41.248
now obviously.

17
00:00:41.248 --> 00:00:42.015
<v ->Yes.</v>

18
00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:43.535
<v Interviewer>But it didn't start that way.</v>

19
00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:45.326
There was a man who was very influential

20
00:00:45.326 --> 00:00:47.045
in your life that really helped you

21
00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:49.029
off the ground and started this.

22
00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:51.473
Can you talk a little bit about how this came to be?

23
00:00:51.473 --> 00:00:54.630
<v ->Sure, The Sedona Method was inspired</v>

24
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.688
by a man named Lester Levenson,

25
00:00:56.688 --> 00:01:00.016
who back in 1952, was sent home to die

26
00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:01.776
from a second coronary.

27
00:01:01.776 --> 00:01:03.429
But rather than give up, he decided

28
00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.701
to go back to the lab within himself

29
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:08.677
and he started a process of self-inquiry.

30
00:01:08.677 --> 00:01:11.066
Asking himself questions like, "Who am I?"

31
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.596
And, "What's this world?"

32
00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:13.928
"What is happiness?"

33
00:01:13.928 --> 00:01:16.705
"What's my relationship to this whole thing?"

34
00:01:16.705 --> 00:01:20.278
He discovered that we all have this natural ability

35
00:01:20.278 --> 00:01:23.243
to discharge, or let go of, the excess baggage

36
00:01:23.243 --> 00:01:25.270
that we usually carry around.

37
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.774
When he discovered that, rather than

38
00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:28.864
just using it to feel a little better,

39
00:01:28.864 --> 00:01:31.861
since he had this death sentence from his doctors,

40
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:34.905
he decided to just keep going with it.

41
00:01:34.905 --> 00:01:36.835
In just three months, he went from

42
00:01:36.835 --> 00:01:40.555
a physical and emotional basket case, literally.

43
00:01:41.072 --> 00:01:42.875
Not only did he have coronary disease,

44
00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:47.451
but he had perforated ulcers, diverticulitis, migraines ...

45
00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:49.936
<v Interviewer>I read the list of ailments, unbelievable.</v>

46
00:01:49.936 --> 00:01:52.101
He was a walking nightmare physically.

47
00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:55.270
<v ->Yeah, and he had had four years of therapy</v>

48
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.499
with an associate of Freud who said,

49
00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:00.153
after four years of trying to help Lester,

50
00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:02.174
"Lester, sorry some people can't be helped."

51
00:02:02.174 --> 00:02:03.226
(laughing)

52
00:02:03.226 --> 00:02:04.452
<v Interviewer>Okay.</v>

53
00:02:04.452 --> 00:02:06.329
<v ->So, he wasn't in great shape.</v>

54
00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.303
He went from that, in three months

55
00:02:08.303 --> 00:02:10.414
of using what he had discovered,

56
00:02:10.414 --> 00:02:12.974
into a state of profound peacefulness.

57
00:02:12.974 --> 00:02:15.321
That he lived in another forty-two years,

58
00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:18.236
after the doctors had given him just weeks to live.

59
00:02:18.236 --> 00:02:21.212
And, what he discovered is that

60
00:02:21.212 --> 00:02:22.930
he could teach this to others.

61
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.881
He discovered it by trial and error.

62
00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:27.345
For about twenty years, he worked with people

63
00:02:27.345 --> 00:02:29.969
on a one to one basis, and in small groups,

64
00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.689
trying to help them discover what he had discovered.

65
00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.102
Then in the early seventies, with the assistance

66
00:02:36.102 --> 00:02:38.843
of some of the people who he'd been working with,

67
00:02:38.843 --> 00:02:41.552
he developed it into a do it yourself system,

68
00:02:41.552 --> 00:02:43.462
that we now call The Sedona Method.

69
00:02:43.462 --> 00:02:48.357
I met Lester back in 1976, at a seminar I organized

70
00:02:48.357 --> 00:02:50.661
for another seminar leader.

71
00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:52.976
Lester came as his guest, I didn't even

72
00:02:52.976 --> 00:02:55.397
notice him in the seminar, but Lester and I

73
00:02:55.397 --> 00:02:57.114
and the seminar leader and one or two

74
00:02:57.114 --> 00:03:00.271
other people went out to lunch.

75
00:03:00.271 --> 00:03:05.271
I was so moved by what he was a living example of.

76
00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.655
There was this presence of awareness, this silence,

77
00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:11.460
this peace, this joy, this love,

78
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.689
that I could tell was unshakable.

79
00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.566
I had seen a lot of teachers, both from

80
00:03:15.566 --> 00:03:18.478
the east and the west before.

81
00:03:18.478 --> 00:03:21.049
No one was really a living example.

82
00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.555
They were still aspiring themselves.

83
00:03:23.555 --> 00:03:26.456
That got my attention.

84
00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:29.251
I decided to take the course, and before the course

85
00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:32.013
was even over, I realized that this

86
00:03:32.013 --> 00:03:34.957
is what I came here to dedicate my life to.

87
00:03:34.957 --> 00:03:37.421
<v Interviewer>That's wonderful and you were a young man.</v>

88
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:38.626
<v ->Oh, I was only twenty-two.</v>

89
00:03:38.626 --> 00:03:39.693
<v Interviewer>Exactly.</v>

90
00:03:39.693 --> 00:03:41.527
That's fabulous to have found your path,

91
00:03:41.527 --> 00:03:43.247
your dharma, so early in life.

92
00:03:43.247 --> 00:03:45.274
<v ->I've been very, very fortunate.</v>

93
00:03:45.274 --> 00:03:47.684
Because I got to work with Lester as my mentor

94
00:03:47.684 --> 00:03:51.865
for eighteen years, and then before he died,

95
00:03:51.865 --> 00:03:53.583
he passed all his copyrights to me

96
00:03:53.583 --> 00:03:56.089
and asked me to continue getting out

97
00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:58.222
what he had developed and continue

98
00:03:58.222 --> 00:04:00.089
improving on it myself.

99
00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:02.169
So that's what I've been doing.

100
00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.071
<v Interview>You've been doing this professionally</v>

101
00:04:04.071 --> 00:04:05.767
for what, twenty-five, twenty-six years?

102
00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:08.764
<v ->Well, I've been doing it since 1976.</v>

103
00:04:08.764 --> 00:04:10.503
<v Interviewer>Okay, so a long time.</v>

104
00:04:10.503 --> 00:04:12.935
<v ->Not all the time full-time professionally,</v>

105
00:04:12.935 --> 00:04:17.020
but it's been a full-time thing since '87.

106
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.932
<v Interviewer>Okay, so you know your stuff.</v>

107
00:04:19.932 --> 00:04:21.321
(laughing)

108
00:04:21.321 --> 00:04:22.645
<v ->I hope so.</v>

109
00:04:22.645 --> 00:04:23.829
<v Interviewer>As you read through the book,</v>

110
00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:26.709
it becomes pretty clear that sadly,

111
00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:29.685
our emotions, conscious and unconscious,

112
00:04:29.685 --> 00:04:31.402
seem to be working against us,

113
00:04:31.402 --> 00:04:33.834
and creating stress in our lives.

114
00:04:33.834 --> 00:04:36.103
Clogging up the superhighway

115
00:04:36.103 --> 00:04:38.633
of the joy of life, and so forth.

116
00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:41.693
Some of the concepts that you talk about in there

117
00:04:41.693 --> 00:04:44.850
at face value, when you first hear it, you think, "Hmm?"

118
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.706
And you're intrigued to go further, you think,

119
00:04:46.706 --> 00:04:48.071
"What's that mean?"

120
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:49.565
One of them I was reading, this is toward

121
00:04:49.565 --> 00:04:50.931
the early part of your book, it says,

122
00:04:50.931 --> 00:04:52.883
when you really reach the core of people ...

123
00:04:52.883 --> 00:04:55.432
We tend to think we're really messed up at the core.

124
00:04:55.432 --> 00:04:58.056
But you're saying, when you reach the real core

125
00:04:58.056 --> 00:04:59.314
what's there is peace.

126
00:04:59.314 --> 00:05:00.562
<v ->Yes.</v>

127
00:05:00.562 --> 00:05:03.890
Everyone naturally, is the presence of awareness.

128
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.885
Is beingness, or peace, or bliss,

129
00:05:05.885 --> 00:05:06.834
or whatever you want to call it.

130
00:05:06.834 --> 00:05:08.604
There are many words to describe it.

131
00:05:08.604 --> 00:05:12.615
That is already here, already now.

132
00:05:12.615 --> 00:05:15.057
In fact, that can't go anywhere,

133
00:05:15.057 --> 00:05:18.078
because it's everywhere present.

134
00:05:18.078 --> 00:05:21.663
It's all knowing, it's actually all-knowingness.

135
00:05:21.663 --> 00:05:24.372
And all power, and that's right at our core.

136
00:05:24.372 --> 00:05:28.256
But what we do, is we look away from it.

137
00:05:28.256 --> 00:05:32.800
We actually believe that the thoughts that we have,

138
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.103
and the feelings that we have, rather than

139
00:05:35.103 --> 00:05:38.794
simply being objects, arising in this awareness

140
00:05:38.794 --> 00:05:41.631
that we are, we believe that is us.

141
00:05:41.631 --> 00:05:43.210
And because we believe we are these

142
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.177
simple objects that are arising

143
00:05:47.177 --> 00:05:49.311
in this presence that we are,

144
00:05:49.311 --> 00:05:50.889
we start identifying with them.

145
00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.470
It actually starts at about age two and a half.

146
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.873
<v Interviewer>I was going to say, do you mind</v>

147
00:05:54.873 --> 00:05:57.315
doing the chronology for us a bit?

148
00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:58.143
<v ->Oh, sure.</v>

149
00:05:58.143 --> 00:05:59.390
<v Interviewer>On how this develops</v>

150
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.507
from the point of birth.

151
00:06:00.507 --> 00:06:02.673
We all innately know it, but sometimes

152
00:06:02.673 --> 00:06:05.692
it's nice to hear it in a crystallized form like this.

153
00:06:05.692 --> 00:06:06.460
<v ->Sure.</v>

154
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.150
Well, we come in and for the first couple

155
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.043
of years of life, we're simply living presence.

156
00:06:14.043 --> 00:06:17.115
There's seeing, there's hearing, there's feeling,

157
00:06:17.115 --> 00:06:19.995
there's reacting, it's all going on naturally,

158
00:06:19.995 --> 00:06:23.355
but without this imagined separate person

159
00:06:23.355 --> 00:06:25.957
taking credit for it.

160
00:06:25.957 --> 00:06:29.466
And then what happens over time

161
00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:31.994
our parents convince us that there's

162
00:06:31.994 --> 00:06:34.949
somebody here separate from everybody else.

163
00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:36.730
And it's done very simply, we say,

164
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.519
"Hale," we say, "Daddy," "Mommy."

165
00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:42.586
"Daddy," "Mommy."

166
00:06:42.586 --> 00:06:45.764
We do this thing with ourselves

167
00:06:45.764 --> 00:06:48.249
where we're getting programmed

168
00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:50.318
to believe that there's actually someone here.

169
00:06:50.318 --> 00:06:53.753
Then, what happens after that,

170
00:06:53.753 --> 00:06:56.099
we start relating to everything in the third person.

171
00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:57.817
'Cause we still don't believe it.

172
00:06:57.817 --> 00:07:01.411
So, it's "Hale's toy," and "Hale wants to do this."

173
00:07:01.411 --> 00:07:03.875
Then at around age two or two and a half.

174
00:07:03.875 --> 00:07:04.963
<v Interviewer>Terrible twos.</v>

175
00:07:04.963 --> 00:07:05.827
(laughing)

176
00:07:05.827 --> 00:07:07.939
<v ->Right, the terrible twos.</v>

177
00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:12.939
It goes from, "Hale's toy," to "my toy."

178
00:07:13.005 --> 00:07:16.738
Once it becomes my toy, at the same time

179
00:07:16.738 --> 00:07:19.341
you start believing firmly in this belief

180
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:21.655
that there's a me and others.

181
00:07:21.655 --> 00:07:24.236
There's a me and other than me.

182
00:07:24.236 --> 00:07:27.645
But it's just a belief, it's brainwashing.

183
00:07:27.645 --> 00:07:32.645
That brainwashing, that belief, is very transparent.

184
00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:36.072
Even in this moment, there is only hearing,

185
00:07:36.072 --> 00:07:39.432
seeing, feeling, being, it's all happening

186
00:07:39.432 --> 00:07:41.853
effortlessly and spontaneously.

187
00:07:41.853 --> 00:07:44.519
So what The Sedona Method allows you to do,

188
00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:48.466
is start to let go of that self-hypnosis.

189
00:07:48.466 --> 00:07:52.551
Start to let go of all the beliefs

190
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:55.484
that are causing us to look away from this

191
00:07:55.484 --> 00:07:57.681
presence of awareness that we are.

192
00:07:57.681 --> 00:07:58.726
<v Interviewer>It seems the word that</v>

193
00:07:58.726 --> 00:08:01.329
comes up frequently in all the questions is "Now."

194
00:08:01.329 --> 00:08:02.093
<v ->Right.</v>

195
00:08:02.093 --> 00:08:03.366
<v Interviewer>You start with "now,"</v>

196
00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:06.534
and a lot of people must have initial issues

197
00:08:06.534 --> 00:08:08.400
with this because they start to realize

198
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.000
they're never in the now.

199
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.280
"What do you mean how do I feel?"

200
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.955
"You mean this very second?"

201
00:08:12.955 --> 00:08:13.765
(laughing)

202
00:08:13.765 --> 00:08:15.148
Because it's always projected into

203
00:08:15.148 --> 00:08:15.929
the future or past.

204
00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:19.226
<v ->Yes but, the past is only a projection of the mind,</v>

205
00:08:19.226 --> 00:08:20.550
and so is the future.

206
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:21.478
There is only now.

207
00:08:21.478 --> 00:08:23.750
You can only think about the past now.

208
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.982
You can only think about the future now.

209
00:08:26.982 --> 00:08:30.256
You can only do anything about anything now.

210
00:08:30.256 --> 00:08:32.688
You can't go into the past.

211
00:08:32.688 --> 00:08:35.877
It's in our language, it's another mistake in our language.

212
00:08:35.877 --> 00:08:37.658
You actually cannot go into the past

213
00:08:37.658 --> 00:08:39.429
or go into the future.

214
00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:42.842
Where you are is here, now.

215
00:08:42.842 --> 00:08:44.047
And that's always the case.

216
00:08:44.047 --> 00:08:46.021
No matter how lost you are in your stories.

217
00:08:46.021 --> 00:08:49.967
No matter how much you've identified with your suffering.

218
00:08:49.967 --> 00:08:52.356
Even that's always happening now.

219
00:08:52.356 --> 00:08:54.681
But, our suffering, and the stories

220
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:57.124
we tell ourselves about our suffering,

221
00:08:57.124 --> 00:08:59.886
makes us believe that there's this chronology.

222
00:08:59.886 --> 00:09:03.107
And that we're the story, as opposed to

223
00:09:03.107 --> 00:09:07.615
the presence of awareness, that is here, now.

224
00:09:08.015 --> 00:09:11.866
And as you recognize that you're not the story,

225
00:09:11.866 --> 00:09:13.818
you're not memory.

226
00:09:13.818 --> 00:09:17.156
What you are is simply present here, now.

227
00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:21.413
As you recognize it, it's very easy to simply live that.

228
00:09:21.413 --> 00:09:24.261
What The Sedona Method does is, it shows you

229
00:09:24.261 --> 00:09:27.793
how to let go of all those reference points.

230
00:09:27.793 --> 00:09:29.819
How to let go of all those crystallizations.

231
00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.675
How to let go of all those beliefs,

232
00:09:31.675 --> 00:09:34.182
feelings and thoughts from the past.

233
00:09:34.182 --> 00:09:36.710
That cause you to actually believe you're separate

234
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.867
and that you have to suffer.

235
00:09:39.377 --> 00:09:41.353
<v Interviewer>And very effectively.</v>

236
00:09:41.353 --> 00:09:44.041
It's very elegant in its simplicity as well.

237
00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:48.002
You have to do the work, but it's very achievable.

238
00:09:48.002 --> 00:09:48.812
<v ->Yes.</v>

239
00:09:48.812 --> 00:09:50.757
<v Interviewer>Either through audio, or in person.</v>

240
00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:52.239
Or through the books.

241
00:09:52.239 --> 00:09:55.019
Just on that subject now, this is a wee bit of a side,

242
00:09:55.019 --> 00:09:57.373
then I wanna go right back where you were a second ago.

243
00:09:57.373 --> 00:09:59.464
This whole subject of now.

244
00:09:59.464 --> 00:10:02.343
With children in particular, one of the things

245
00:10:02.343 --> 00:10:05.618
I noticed in my own self as I was going

246
00:10:05.618 --> 00:10:07.591
through the educational system as a child,

247
00:10:07.591 --> 00:10:10.236
was the total lack of presence in the now.

248
00:10:10.236 --> 00:10:10.940
<v ->Right.</v>

249
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.257
<v Interviewer>Bored, tune-out.</v>

250
00:10:12.257 --> 00:10:13.313
<v ->Right, right. (speech overlapping)</v>

251
00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:14.203
<v Interviewer>Unless it was science.</v>

252
00:10:14.203 --> 00:10:16.035
I loved science and art, hated everything else.

253
00:10:16.035 --> 00:10:18.051
So the classes were interminable

254
00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:19.791
and of course my grades were poor.

255
00:10:19.791 --> 00:10:20.523
<v ->Right.</v>

256
00:10:20.523 --> 00:10:21.843
<v Interviewer>Except for the few that I loved.</v>

257
00:10:21.843 --> 00:10:26.843
I started sharing with my son, if you can be here now.

258
00:10:27.133 --> 00:10:29.394
If you can be in that class now, listening,

259
00:10:29.394 --> 00:10:33.245
tuned in to that teacher, the class time flies by,

260
00:10:33.245 --> 00:10:34.493
the A's are automatic.

261
00:10:34.493 --> 00:10:37.053
Everything seems to be automatic if you

262
00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:39.207
truly show up in the present.

263
00:10:39.207 --> 00:10:40.210
<v ->Right.</v>

264
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.831
Well, it is already automatic.

265
00:10:41.831 --> 00:10:42.514
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

266
00:10:42.514 --> 00:10:46.428
<v ->The presence of awareness or the present moment,</v>

267
00:10:46.428 --> 00:10:49.638
is already always taking care of itself.

268
00:10:49.638 --> 00:10:51.398
It doesn't need our help.

269
00:10:51.398 --> 00:10:52.401
That's a lie.

270
00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:53.649
<v Interviewer>Just dialing into it</v>

271
00:10:53.649 --> 00:10:55.910
and hanging there with it, instead of

272
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.321
allowing one's self to become distracted.

273
00:10:58.321 --> 00:11:00.454
<v ->I understand, but you don't really need to dial into it.</v>

274
00:11:00.454 --> 00:11:02.054
Again, it just is.

275
00:11:02.054 --> 00:11:03.238
<v Interviewer>(speech overlapping) It just exists.</v>

276
00:11:03.238 --> 00:11:06.885
The more any efforting to be is

277
00:11:06.885 --> 00:11:09.925
a denial of that which you already are.

278
00:11:09.925 --> 00:11:14.737
So everytime we're trying to get to here and now,

279
00:11:14.737 --> 00:11:16.411
we're looking away.

280
00:11:16.411 --> 00:11:17.147
Think about it.

281
00:11:17.147 --> 00:11:18.491
<v Interviewer>So, it's the absence of not trying</v>

282
00:11:18.491 --> 00:11:19.494
to leave here and now.

283
00:11:19.494 --> 00:11:20.582
<v ->Right, exactly.</v>

284
00:11:20.582 --> 00:11:21.828
Well, boredom comes from,

285
00:11:21.828 --> 00:11:23.727
"Gee, I'd rather be doing something else."

286
00:11:23.727 --> 00:11:24.655
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

287
00:11:24.655 --> 00:11:25.892
<v ->I love this quote.</v>

288
00:11:25.892 --> 00:11:27.375
"Do what you do when you're doing it."

289
00:11:27.375 --> 00:11:28.996
"And don't do what you're not doing,"

290
00:11:28.996 --> 00:11:30.041
"when you're not doing it."

291
00:11:30.041 --> 00:11:31.182
<v Interviewer>That's very good.</v>

292
00:11:31.182 --> 00:11:33.406
Very true, very useful.

293
00:11:33.406 --> 00:11:36.993
(laughing)

294
00:11:36.993 --> 00:11:39.597
<v ->Because what happens is, we rarely do that.</v>

295
00:11:39.597 --> 00:11:43.202
Most of us are so busy projecting into the future,

296
00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:45.709
or regretting something from the past,

297
00:11:45.709 --> 00:11:49.005
that we miss the presence that is here,

298
00:11:49.005 --> 00:11:51.885
the presence that is now.

299
00:11:51.885 --> 00:11:53.346
The problem with the educational system

300
00:11:53.346 --> 00:11:56.472
is it's all future driven.

301
00:11:56.472 --> 00:11:59.384
There's nothing about the educational system

302
00:11:59.384 --> 00:12:00.888
that even pays attention to

303
00:12:00.888 --> 00:12:03.256
what's actually happening here now.

304
00:12:03.256 --> 00:12:05.261
It's all based on what was or what might be.

305
00:12:05.261 --> 00:12:06.466
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

306
00:12:06.466 --> 00:12:08.621
<v ->And it's all about information.</v>

307
00:12:08.621 --> 00:12:11.522
And information is easily or readily available.

308
00:12:11.522 --> 00:12:13.058
We live in the internet age.

309
00:12:13.058 --> 00:12:15.895
So, why are we trying to accumulate information?

310
00:12:15.895 --> 00:12:16.684
That's dumb.

311
00:12:16.684 --> 00:12:17.730
<v Interviewer>Right, exactly.</v>

312
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.884
<v ->What we need to know is how to use the information,</v>

313
00:12:19.884 --> 00:12:22.135
how to access the information, and how to

314
00:12:22.135 --> 00:12:24.737
really just be present with what is.

315
00:12:24.737 --> 00:12:27.297
So that our intuitive knowingness and our

316
00:12:27.297 --> 00:12:31.012
clear reason, can simply function naturally.

317
00:12:31.012 --> 00:12:32.419
That's what's here.

318
00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:35.075
The more you let go, using The Sedona Method,

319
00:12:35.075 --> 00:12:37.528
what you do is you uncover your

320
00:12:37.528 --> 00:12:40.568
intuitive knowing and your clear reason.

321
00:12:40.568 --> 00:12:42.484
Because that's all right here, right now.

322
00:12:42.484 --> 00:12:43.899
<v Interviewer>It already exists, if you don't</v>

323
00:12:43.899 --> 00:12:44.703
obscure it with past present.

324
00:12:44.703 --> 00:12:45.646
<v ->Exactly.</v>

325
00:12:45.646 --> 00:12:47.640
<v Interviewer>Let's go back onto the track again.</v>

326
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.264
One of the things you mention in this book,

327
00:12:50.264 --> 00:12:52.867
you talk about, is that feelings actually lie.

328
00:12:52.867 --> 00:12:54.861
Now a lot of us, a lot of different techniques

329
00:12:54.861 --> 00:12:56.344
tell you, "You gotta get to the feelings."

330
00:12:56.344 --> 00:12:57.325
"That's where the truth is."

331
00:12:57.325 --> 00:12:58.690
You're saying, "Not necessarily."

332
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.621
"Feelings lie."

333
00:13:00.621 --> 00:13:02.754
<v ->Well, actually I agree with them,</v>

334
00:13:02.754 --> 00:13:04.354
but that's only a starting point.

335
00:13:04.354 --> 00:13:06.701
There are a lot of techniques out there

336
00:13:06.701 --> 00:13:09.324
that try to get you to feel what you're feeling.

337
00:13:09.324 --> 00:13:11.692
And if you're not even feeling what you're feeling,

338
00:13:11.692 --> 00:13:13.111
then you're really lost.

339
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:14.455
(laughing)

340
00:13:14.455 --> 00:13:16.193
So the first step in The Sedona Method,

341
00:13:16.193 --> 00:13:18.359
is to actually notice what's here now.

342
00:13:18.359 --> 00:13:21.046
The sensations, which we make up

343
00:13:21.046 --> 00:13:23.510
into stories, which turn into feelings.

344
00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.465
The pictures, and all the sounds,

345
00:13:26.465 --> 00:13:27.649
which are just our thoughts.

346
00:13:27.649 --> 00:13:29.334
That's what's here now.

347
00:13:29.334 --> 00:13:30.774
That's all effortless.

348
00:13:30.774 --> 00:13:32.843
It's simply arising by itself.

349
00:13:32.843 --> 00:13:36.936
And you don't have to ...

350
00:13:40.003 --> 00:13:42.776
That's just the beginning.

351
00:13:42.776 --> 00:13:44.557
If you're really present with that,

352
00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:46.040
and welcome it, it starts to dissolve.

353
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.503
That's one of the ways that we use The Sedona Method,

354
00:13:48.503 --> 00:13:53.197
by simply welcoming whatever it is that's here now.

355
00:13:53.197 --> 00:13:55.052
Most of us are resisting what's here now.

356
00:13:55.052 --> 00:13:57.324
'Cause we're wanting it to be different than the way it is.

357
00:13:57.324 --> 00:13:58.604
<v Interviewer>Or we feel it's too painful to bear</v>

358
00:13:58.604 --> 00:13:59.532
in the moment.

359
00:13:59.532 --> 00:14:00.300
<v ->Right.</v>

360
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.017
<v Interviewer>Don't want to open up that can of worms ...</v>

361
00:14:02.017 --> 00:14:02.828
<v ->Right, exactly.</v>

362
00:14:02.828 --> 00:14:04.918
But the pain in the moment is

363
00:14:04.918 --> 00:14:06.518
always referencing the past.

364
00:14:06.518 --> 00:14:07.382
<v Interviewer>Yes.</v>

365
00:14:07.382 --> 00:14:10.707
<v ->There's nothing unbearable, if you're fully present.</v>

366
00:14:11.588 --> 00:14:14.361
Or, let me rephrase that.

367
00:14:14.361 --> 00:14:16.654
You are always fully presence,

368
00:14:16.654 --> 00:14:19.001
but the more aware you are,

369
00:14:19.001 --> 00:14:20.643
of this presence that you are,

370
00:14:20.643 --> 00:14:24.056
the less identified you are with whatever is arising.

371
00:14:24.056 --> 00:14:27.288
So, the body may be in pain, and so what?

372
00:14:27.288 --> 00:14:31.075
Your life may not be going the way you choose, and so what?

373
00:14:31.075 --> 00:14:35.277
When you're okay, whether it's going your way or not,

374
00:14:35.277 --> 00:14:37.090
then you can do your best to have it

375
00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:38.594
turn out the way you want.

376
00:14:38.594 --> 00:14:40.194
But you're not attached to the outcome.

377
00:14:40.194 --> 00:14:45.194
So, things naturally flow in a more positive direction

378
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.236
and the suffering, which comes from believing

379
00:14:48.236 --> 00:14:52.024
there's a me, separate from everything else ...

380
00:14:52.024 --> 00:14:53.955
It starts to dissolve.

381
00:14:53.955 --> 00:14:55.921
<v Interviewer>Can you use the computer analogy,</v>

382
00:14:55.921 --> 00:14:56.749
you write about?

383
00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:57.574
<v ->Sure.</v>

384
00:14:57.574 --> 00:14:58.926
<v Interviewer>And our emotions, 'cause I think</v>

385
00:14:58.926 --> 00:15:00.242
most people can understand that.

386
00:15:00.242 --> 00:15:00.927
Visceral.

387
00:15:00.927 --> 00:15:02.174
<v ->Yes it is, it's very ...</v>

388
00:15:02.174 --> 00:15:03.033
(laughing)

389
00:15:03.033 --> 00:15:05.550
So, what happens in a computer

390
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.174
is that if you have too many programs

391
00:15:08.174 --> 00:15:11.258
running at the same time, the computer

392
00:15:11.258 --> 00:15:12.815
slows down and slows down

393
00:15:12.815 --> 00:15:15.791
and slows down, until it finally crashes.

394
00:15:15.791 --> 00:15:20.569
And what happens with a computer

395
00:15:20.569 --> 00:15:23.172
is very similar to what happens with the mind.

396
00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:26.051
Anything that's unresolved from the past.

397
00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:29.166
Our past problems, our past regrets.

398
00:15:29.166 --> 00:15:31.278
Anything that we're thinking about

399
00:15:31.278 --> 00:15:33.784
that doesn't have to do with right now.

400
00:15:33.784 --> 00:15:38.778
All that is robbing our processing ability, our memory.

401
00:15:38.778 --> 00:15:42.330
It causes us to slow down and for most of us,

402
00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.167
it eventually causes us to crash and burn.

403
00:15:45.167 --> 00:15:49.188
But when you let go, what happens ...

404
00:15:49.188 --> 00:15:50.437
<v Interviewer>Is that in essence,</v>

405
00:15:50.437 --> 00:15:51.385
closing out the programs?

406
00:15:51.385 --> 00:15:55.570
<v ->Yes, you save the wisdom.</v>

407
00:15:56.877 --> 00:15:59.640
That's naturally there, because it is you.

408
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.178
Wisdom is your beingness.

409
00:16:02.178 --> 00:16:05.282
It is your knowingness, so you can't lose the wisdom.

410
00:16:05.282 --> 00:16:07.981
But all the suffering and all that power

411
00:16:07.981 --> 00:16:11.202
that's being sucked into, all these things from the past.

412
00:16:11.202 --> 00:16:15.991
All the energy, that should be just used to live life now,

413
00:16:15.991 --> 00:16:19.329
which is going into all this anticipation and regret.

414
00:16:19.329 --> 00:16:23.585
That dissolves and then you have this tremendous energy,

415
00:16:23.585 --> 00:16:26.465
and tremendous awareness of what is,

416
00:16:26.465 --> 00:16:28.012
to deal with what's here now.

417
00:16:28.012 --> 00:16:31.394
And then you deal with it a lot more effectively.

418
00:16:31.394 --> 00:16:34.668
You basically turn off all those programs

419
00:16:34.668 --> 00:16:36.034
that are running in the background

420
00:16:36.034 --> 00:16:39.009
and you simply deal with life spontaneously,

421
00:16:39.009 --> 00:16:42.817
from your intuitive knowingness and your clear reason.

422
00:16:42.817 --> 00:16:44.248
<v Interviewer>This doesn't just</v>

423
00:16:44.248 --> 00:16:46.349
effect your emotional state of being.

424
00:16:46.349 --> 00:16:48.685
This effects our physical health as well.

425
00:16:48.685 --> 00:16:50.872
This must be one of the keys as to what

426
00:16:50.872 --> 00:16:53.538
Lester learned in his journey to healing.

427
00:16:53.538 --> 00:16:55.629
Having these open programs and everything

428
00:16:55.629 --> 00:16:56.536
(overlapping) clogging ...

429
00:16:56.536 --> 00:16:57.346
<v ->(overlapping) Yes.</v>

430
00:16:57.346 --> 00:16:58.530
<v Interviewer>... the pathways.</v>

431
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.226
Also effects very specifically,

432
00:17:00.226 --> 00:17:01.730
certain aspects of our health.

433
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.639
In particular, can you talk a little bit about

434
00:17:03.639 --> 00:17:04.752
how that works with the body?

435
00:17:04.752 --> 00:17:06.117
<v ->Sure.</v>

436
00:17:06.117 --> 00:17:09.231
Our immune system functions naturally.

437
00:17:09.851 --> 00:17:11.238
Everything about our body

438
00:17:11.238 --> 00:17:13.879
is designed to be self-sustaining.

439
00:17:14.535 --> 00:17:17.298
What happens is, when we're really stressed,

440
00:17:17.298 --> 00:17:20.572
we're really upset, we start interfering with

441
00:17:20.572 --> 00:17:22.993
our body's natural ability to heal.

442
00:17:22.993 --> 00:17:24.497
Even though The Sedona Method has

443
00:17:24.497 --> 00:17:28.188
never, ever attempted to treat, diagnose, cure

444
00:17:28.188 --> 00:17:31.740
or even advise about any kind of physical condition,

445
00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:36.740
we've seen people, even with long, "incurable,"

446
00:17:36.923 --> 00:17:41.403
conditions, have them either drop away completely

447
00:17:41.403 --> 00:17:44.304
or get much better.

448
00:17:44.304 --> 00:17:47.045
The one thing that's universal with The Sedona Method,

449
00:17:47.045 --> 00:17:49.488
is that anyone who applies it in the area of

450
00:17:49.488 --> 00:17:54.488
health and well-being, finds that disease

451
00:17:55.685 --> 00:17:56.559
is really two words.

452
00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:59.002
Dis and ease.

453
00:17:59.002 --> 00:18:01.030
So, you remove the dis.

454
00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.352
You stop dissing yourself.

455
00:18:02.352 --> 00:18:03.579
(laughing)

456
00:18:03.579 --> 00:18:08.293
What happens is, you discover that when

457
00:18:08.293 --> 00:18:10.757
you're not reacting to the symptoms,

458
00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:13.637
the symptoms themselves aren't that meaningful,

459
00:18:13.637 --> 00:18:16.303
aren't that important and don't cause suffering.

460
00:18:16.303 --> 00:18:19.396
It's all the reaction we have to the symptoms.

461
00:18:19.396 --> 00:18:21.882
It's all the projection we do around the symptoms.

462
00:18:21.882 --> 00:18:23.620
"Oh, that means this is gonna happen,"

463
00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.380
"or that's gonna happen."

464
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.375
That causes the suffering.

465
00:18:27.375 --> 00:18:29.102
It's all the anticipation of the future ...

466
00:18:29.102 --> 00:18:30.094
<v Interviewer>And then once you have a symptom,</v>

467
00:18:30.094 --> 00:18:31.513
you start having fear around it.

468
00:18:31.513 --> 00:18:32.301
<v ->Exactly.</v>

469
00:18:32.301 --> 00:18:33.246
<v ->Then what happens?</v>

470
00:18:33.246 --> 00:18:34.910
<v ->Right, it all collapses in on itself</v>

471
00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.214
and it just gets worse.

472
00:18:36.214 --> 00:18:38.763
With the The Sedona Method, you stop that process.

473
00:18:38.763 --> 00:18:41.898
Instead of getting lost in the story about,

474
00:18:41.898 --> 00:18:43.968
"I have this, or I have that."

475
00:18:43.968 --> 00:18:46.538
Most of us have these designer labels

476
00:18:46.538 --> 00:18:47.978
that we wear around when we've

477
00:18:47.978 --> 00:18:50.261
been diagnosed with something.

478
00:18:50.261 --> 00:18:51.743
Again, you can't ignore them.

479
00:18:51.743 --> 00:18:52.671
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

480
00:18:52.671 --> 00:18:55.316
<v ->But they're not good meditation points.</v>

481
00:18:55.316 --> 00:18:57.364
<v Interviewer>"I have fibromyalgia."</v>

482
00:18:57.364 --> 00:19:01.663
"I have post-traumatic stress disorder."

483
00:19:01.663 --> 00:19:02.559
<v ->Right.</v>

484
00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:03.518
<v Interviewer>You're talking about that.</v>

485
00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:04.468
<v ->Yes, exactly.</v>

486
00:19:04.468 --> 00:19:06.051
But here's the thing, most people

487
00:19:06.051 --> 00:19:07.852
live as though they are that.

488
00:19:07.852 --> 00:19:08.827
They don't just have it.

489
00:19:08.827 --> 00:19:10.516
<v Interviewer>(overlapping) Their designer label disease.</v>

490
00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:11.421
<v ->Yes, they are it.</v>

491
00:19:11.421 --> 00:19:14.002
"I'm a cancer patient."

492
00:19:14.002 --> 00:19:18.695
"I am" these things.

493
00:19:18.695 --> 00:19:21.287
And anything we add our "I am" to,

494
00:19:21.287 --> 00:19:22.685
takes over our awareness.

495
00:19:22.685 --> 00:19:24.050
<v Interviewer>The languaging here</v>

496
00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:25.724
is really important, isn't it?

497
00:19:25.724 --> 00:19:27.954
The "I am," can you talk about that?

498
00:19:27.954 --> 00:19:29.020
<v ->Well, sure.</v>

499
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.760
"I am" is simply the closest the mind can come

500
00:19:35.009 --> 00:19:37.996
to referring to the presence of awareness that you are.

501
00:19:37.996 --> 00:19:41.718
It isn't it, but it's the closest it can come.

502
00:19:41.718 --> 00:19:43.019
But what the mind generally does,

503
00:19:43.019 --> 00:19:47.499
is project that outwards, into the world.

504
00:19:47.499 --> 00:19:49.984
"I'm a man," "I'm a woman," "I'm sick,"

505
00:19:49.984 --> 00:19:52.747
"I'm happy," "I'm sad," "I'm right," "I'm wrong,"

506
00:19:52.747 --> 00:19:56.533
"I'm good, " "I'm bad", "I'm angry," "I'm sad."

507
00:19:56.533 --> 00:20:00.501
All that is a way of looking away

508
00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:02.911
from this presence of awareness that you are.

509
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:06.773
And is vesting your energy into

510
00:20:06.773 --> 00:20:10.036
creating this illusion of separation.

511
00:20:10.036 --> 00:20:11.551
<v Interviewer>Into creating a new program.</v>

512
00:20:11.551 --> 00:20:12.831
<v ->Right, exactly.</v>

513
00:20:12.831 --> 00:20:15.265
Not only creating a program, but getting lost in it.

514
00:20:15.265 --> 00:20:16.553
<v Interviewer>Getting lost in it.</v>

515
00:20:16.553 --> 00:20:17.315
<v ->Yeah.</v>

516
00:20:17.315 --> 00:20:19.087
<v Interviewer>And people have attachments</v>

517
00:20:19.087 --> 00:20:22.073
like this, I mean they have attachments to their stories.

518
00:20:22.073 --> 00:20:24.353
One of the people you write about in your book ...

519
00:20:24.353 --> 00:20:27.196
It was interesting because it showed how this works.

520
00:20:27.196 --> 00:20:29.105
Was the man who witnessed nine eleven.

521
00:20:29.105 --> 00:20:29.873
<v ->Right.</v>

522
00:20:29.873 --> 00:20:30.865
<v Interviewer>Do you want to share?</v>

523
00:20:30.865 --> 00:20:32.731
That's anecdotal, but would you like to share that?

524
00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:34.587
<v ->Sure, sure.</v>

525
00:20:34.587 --> 00:20:37.510
I was leading a ... we do seven day retreats

526
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:40.272
in Sedona, Arizona, and I was leading one.

527
00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:43.388
I think it was only about six weeks, after nine eleven.

528
00:20:43.388 --> 00:20:45.960
Interesting, it was the biggest one we've had

529
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.594
up until that point.

530
00:20:47.594 --> 00:20:49.599
Despite nine eleven and all the people

531
00:20:49.599 --> 00:20:52.383
being afraid of traveling, the retreat attendance

532
00:20:52.383 --> 00:20:53.748
actually went up.

533
00:20:53.748 --> 00:20:57.278
But any rate, one of the attendees at this retreat

534
00:20:57.278 --> 00:20:59.817
was actually there at nine eleven.

535
00:20:59.817 --> 00:21:03.230
He came out of the subway just as the

536
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.961
first plane hit the building.

537
00:21:05.961 --> 00:21:09.470
He actually saw people jumping out of buildings.

538
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:10.888
People running out of their shoes.

539
00:21:10.888 --> 00:21:12.862
The whole thing.

540
00:21:13.552 --> 00:21:16.606
He was severely traumatized by the whole thing.

541
00:21:16.606 --> 00:21:21.429
He knew this process, but he was a little stuck.

542
00:21:21.429 --> 00:21:23.712
Because he was feeling better, but still when

543
00:21:23.712 --> 00:21:25.685
he heard a loud noise or ...

544
00:21:25.685 --> 00:21:27.584
All the constant repetition we were

545
00:21:27.584 --> 00:21:28.864
going through at that time.

546
00:21:28.864 --> 00:21:29.813
<v Interviewer>With the media.</v>

547
00:21:29.813 --> 00:21:31.743
<v ->Was very traumatic.</v>

548
00:21:31.743 --> 00:21:34.996
What he didn't see, and a lot of us don't see

549
00:21:34.996 --> 00:21:38.447
when we're dealing with our problems.

550
00:21:38.447 --> 00:21:41.685
There was a subtle specialness about him

551
00:21:41.685 --> 00:21:43.029
because he was actually there.

552
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:45.258
He was actually witness to an event that

553
00:21:45.258 --> 00:21:47.114
the entire world knew about.

554
00:21:47.114 --> 00:21:49.639
There aren't many of those type of events.

555
00:21:49.639 --> 00:21:52.815
Because of that, he had really identified

556
00:21:52.815 --> 00:21:56.804
as being the special person who was at nine eleven.

557
00:21:56.804 --> 00:22:00.868
When he recognized that he had been puffing himself up,

558
00:22:00.868 --> 00:22:03.748
even though he was really traumatized.

559
00:22:03.748 --> 00:22:06.073
But that puff is where he was hooked.

560
00:22:06.073 --> 00:22:08.676
When he realized that he had been

561
00:22:08.676 --> 00:22:11.556
identifying as someone who was special

562
00:22:11.556 --> 00:22:15.705
and been at nine eleven, and he let that go.

563
00:22:15.705 --> 00:22:17.592
All the trauma left.

564
00:22:17.592 --> 00:22:20.376
I've seen that happen over and over

565
00:22:20.376 --> 00:22:22.136
and over again with people.

566
00:22:22.136 --> 00:22:25.741
People often will say they really

567
00:22:25.741 --> 00:22:27.714
want to let go of a problem,

568
00:22:27.714 --> 00:22:29.240
but because they've invested so much

569
00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.309
time and energy working on it.

570
00:22:31.309 --> 00:22:33.998
Because it's the way they're special and unique.

571
00:22:33.998 --> 00:22:36.515
<v Interviewer>The way they see and identify themselves.</v>

572
00:22:36.515 --> 00:22:37.464
<v ->Exactly.</v>

573
00:22:37.464 --> 00:22:40.248
Because often they've invested so much

574
00:22:40.248 --> 00:22:41.987
time and energy in it, that they

575
00:22:41.987 --> 00:22:43.992
don't even know there's anything more than that.

576
00:22:43.992 --> 00:22:46.237
Or beyond that.

577
00:22:46.237 --> 00:22:48.612
They become hesitant, or afraid to let it go.

578
00:22:48.612 --> 00:22:50.052
But when they let go of wanting to be

579
00:22:50.052 --> 00:22:51.929
that special someone who wins.

580
00:22:51.929 --> 00:22:55.001
Or that special someone who never can make money.

581
00:22:55.001 --> 00:22:56.996
Or that special someone who can

582
00:22:56.996 --> 00:22:59.939
never have the ideal relationship.

583
00:22:59.939 --> 00:23:02.979
Once you let that go, it's really easy.

584
00:23:02.979 --> 00:23:05.144
To discover what's actually here.

585
00:23:05.144 --> 00:23:08.461
'Cause in this moment, there's always infinite possibility.

586
00:23:08.461 --> 00:23:12.525
There's always the possibility of a positive creation.

587
00:23:12.525 --> 00:23:15.480
<v Interviewer>That brings us to the subject of certainty.</v>

588
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.754
That identification within themselves

589
00:23:18.754 --> 00:23:21.047
creates a certain kind of certainty

590
00:23:21.047 --> 00:23:24.716
about their outlook on life and who they are.

591
00:23:24.716 --> 00:23:26.370
And you're saying that we have to

592
00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:29.687
let go of the certainty in order to allow the true

593
00:23:29.687 --> 00:23:32.727
intuitive aspect to have space to come in?

594
00:23:32.727 --> 00:23:33.804
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>

595
00:23:33.804 --> 00:23:38.804
That certainty that we often have is artificial.

596
00:23:39.052 --> 00:23:42.134
We're basing it on what was.

597
00:23:42.134 --> 00:23:43.457
Then we don't realize why we're having

598
00:23:43.457 --> 00:23:46.379
such a hard time dealing with what is.

599
00:23:46.379 --> 00:23:50.358
There's a momentary sense of uncertainty

600
00:23:50.358 --> 00:23:53.931
that comes from letting go of referencing the past.

601
00:23:53.931 --> 00:23:56.064
But it's very momentary.

602
00:23:56.064 --> 00:23:58.570
When you live as presence awareness,

603
00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.056
when you're simply here now,

604
00:24:01.056 --> 00:24:04.212
there's almost no uncertainty about anything.

605
00:24:04.212 --> 00:24:05.720
You might not know the facts,

606
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.109
but you can always find out the facts.

607
00:24:08.109 --> 00:24:10.637
But there is this inner knowingness,

608
00:24:10.637 --> 00:24:13.869
this inner relaxation, this inner sense

609
00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:18.701
that you can handle whatever life brings up.

610
00:24:18.701 --> 00:24:22.711
Because there's no separation from the flow of living.

611
00:24:22.711 --> 00:24:24.898
You are the flow of living.

612
00:24:24.898 --> 00:24:29.537
Because of that, certainty, most of the time

613
00:24:29.537 --> 00:24:31.287
isn't even an issue.

614
00:24:31.287 --> 00:24:32.279
<v Interviewer>Right, and it's really a</v>

615
00:24:32.279 --> 00:24:35.233
smaller aspect of the mind speaking, isn't it?

616
00:24:35.233 --> 00:24:36.641
Where the other is the greater mind

617
00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:38.870
flowing through and beyond?

618
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.611
<v ->Well, actually the problem is that</v>

619
00:24:41.611 --> 00:24:43.466
the mind is closely aligned to this

620
00:24:43.466 --> 00:24:45.675
presence awareness that we are.

621
00:24:45.675 --> 00:24:49.483
It isn't the presence awareness, but it's closely aligned.

622
00:24:49.483 --> 00:24:51.157
It's filtering it all the time.

623
00:24:51.157 --> 00:24:53.994
It's labeling it, it's describing it.

624
00:24:53.994 --> 00:24:57.962
It's dividing it up.

625
00:24:57.962 --> 00:24:59.562
Because of that, it thinks it's special.

626
00:24:59.562 --> 00:25:00.789
Think it knows something.

627
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:01.973
<v Interviewer>Likes power.</v>

628
00:25:01.973 --> 00:25:04.125
(laughing)

629
00:25:04.125 --> 00:25:06.671
But all its power is artificial, it's all borrowed.

630
00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:08.197
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

631
00:25:08.197 --> 00:25:12.772
<v ->When you stop looking to the mind for the answer,</v>

632
00:25:12.772 --> 00:25:17.772
the answer is always already here, now.

633
00:25:19.617 --> 00:25:22.540
That's liberating because we spent so much

634
00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.748
of our time and energy, and also that goes back

635
00:25:24.748 --> 00:25:26.252
to our educational system.

636
00:25:26.252 --> 00:25:27.467
We've been trained to think that

637
00:25:27.467 --> 00:25:29.203
the answer is in the mind.

638
00:25:29.721 --> 00:25:30.627
But it isn't.

639
00:25:30.627 --> 00:25:32.878
The mind is a wonderful tool,

640
00:25:32.878 --> 00:25:34.830
but a terrible master.

641
00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.989
<v Interviewer>This just popped to mind.</v>

642
00:25:36.989 --> 00:25:38.185
Another example you give in the book

643
00:25:38.185 --> 00:25:39.956
was an engineer who was having

644
00:25:39.956 --> 00:25:42.836
a hard time letting go of his knowingness,

645
00:25:42.836 --> 00:25:45.407
his certainty, because his job depended on it.

646
00:25:45.407 --> 00:25:46.804
Do you recall this particular ...

647
00:25:46.804 --> 00:25:47.572
<v ->Oh, yes.</v>

648
00:25:47.572 --> 00:25:48.777
<v Interviewer>That's a really neat story.</v>

649
00:25:48.777 --> 00:25:49.726
You wanna share that ...

650
00:25:49.726 --> 00:25:50.378
<v ->Sure.</v>

651
00:25:50.378 --> 00:25:51.722
Actually, what's interesting is

652
00:25:51.722 --> 00:25:56.722
that most of us get lost in the mind

653
00:25:56.736 --> 00:25:58.230
through this mechanism.

654
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:59.595
We wanna figure things out.

655
00:25:59.595 --> 00:26:01.218
We wanna understand.

656
00:26:01.218 --> 00:26:03.404
That isn't certainty, that's the lack of certainty.

657
00:26:03.404 --> 00:26:04.727
We confuse it with certainty,

658
00:26:04.727 --> 00:26:06.146
but it has nothing to do with it.

659
00:26:06.146 --> 00:26:06.881
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

660
00:26:06.881 --> 00:26:08.791
<v ->So when we're wanting to understand.</v>

661
00:26:08.791 --> 00:26:11.694
To figure out something, or get the answer.

662
00:26:11.694 --> 00:26:14.808
We're looking away from the answer, in order to find it.

663
00:26:14.808 --> 00:26:17.752
And most people think, that's the only way to do it.

664
00:26:17.752 --> 00:26:20.632
But again, what happens when you let go

665
00:26:20.632 --> 00:26:22.189
of wanting to understand.

666
00:26:22.189 --> 00:26:24.930
When you let go of wanting to figure it out.

667
00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:27.896
When you let go of looking away from the answer.

668
00:26:27.896 --> 00:26:29.965
You discover the answer is already here.

669
00:26:29.965 --> 00:26:31.426
It's already now.

670
00:26:31.426 --> 00:26:33.570
It even works in practical things.

671
00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:38.231
Years ago, in a class I talked about

672
00:26:38.231 --> 00:26:40.460
this thing where if you let go of

673
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.521
wanting to figure it out, you'll get the answer.

674
00:26:43.521 --> 00:26:45.388
There was someone who fought me the whole class,

675
00:26:45.388 --> 00:26:47.521
because he was an engineer and he said,

676
00:26:47.521 --> 00:26:50.347
"No, that's not possible."

677
00:26:50.347 --> 00:26:54.287
What happened is, in between the two weekends of the course.

678
00:26:54.287 --> 00:26:56.059
Years ago we taught it over two weekends,

679
00:26:56.059 --> 00:26:58.918
now it's simply one weekend or an audio program.

680
00:26:58.918 --> 00:27:02.171
In between these two weekends,

681
00:27:02.171 --> 00:27:04.763
he was building a circuit board.

682
00:27:04.763 --> 00:27:06.597
This was before they did it in computer,

683
00:27:06.597 --> 00:27:08.485
they actually did it physically first.

684
00:27:08.485 --> 00:27:10.970
Then they did it by computer ...

685
00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:15.744
Right now they do it by computer.

686
00:27:15.744 --> 00:27:17.301
Then afterwards they build it physically.

687
00:27:17.301 --> 00:27:18.784
But there, they just built it physically.

688
00:27:18.784 --> 00:27:20.479
So, without all the right parts,

689
00:27:20.479 --> 00:27:23.327
he couldn't even test his theories.

690
00:27:23.327 --> 00:27:26.996
What he did, he was almost done with a circuit board

691
00:27:26.996 --> 00:27:28.690
that he needed to test.

692
00:27:30.754 --> 00:27:33.752
He went to this room that was filled

693
00:27:33.752 --> 00:27:37.047
from floor to ceiling with all of these little parts.

694
00:27:37.047 --> 00:27:37.794
<v Interviewer>Little drawers.</v>

695
00:27:37.794 --> 00:27:38.589
(laughing)

696
00:27:38.589 --> 00:27:40.457
<v ->Little drawers, right.</v>

697
00:27:40.457 --> 00:27:41.662
And bins.

698
00:27:41.662 --> 00:27:44.051
What happened is, he went to the bin,

699
00:27:44.051 --> 00:27:46.888
where it was supposed to be, and it was empty.

700
00:27:46.888 --> 00:27:49.320
But he was on a deadline, he needed to finish

701
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.040
what he was doing and he got really frustrated.

702
00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.565
He really wanted to figure out what to do.

703
00:27:53.565 --> 00:27:56.520
And he said, "Oh, I'm gonna prove him wrong."

704
00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.800
(laughing)

705
00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.400
"I'm gonna let go of wanting to figure out"

706
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.351
"and I'm sure that's not going to make any difference."

707
00:28:01.351 --> 00:28:05.202
So he let go of wanting to figure out where it might be

708
00:28:05.202 --> 00:28:09.682
and then he was intuitively guided to walk around

709
00:28:09.682 --> 00:28:12.497
the corner, reach up into another bin, which was

710
00:28:12.497 --> 00:28:14.492
labeled for something else.

711
00:28:14.492 --> 00:28:15.633
He had never done this before.

712
00:28:15.633 --> 00:28:17.969
He reached in and the first part he touched

713
00:28:17.969 --> 00:28:21.340
was a misplaced part that was the one he needed

714
00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.523
for the circuit board.

715
00:28:22.523 --> 00:28:23.355
<v Interviewer>Isn't that amazing?</v>

716
00:28:23.355 --> 00:28:24.315
<v ->And he was totally blown away,</v>

717
00:28:24.315 --> 00:28:25.702
because he was doing it to try to

718
00:28:25.702 --> 00:28:27.792
prove the whole theory wrong.

719
00:28:27.792 --> 00:28:29.286
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

720
00:28:29.286 --> 00:28:33.115
What's interesting about this, is science itself.

721
00:28:33.115 --> 00:28:34.853
I mean, he was obviously a man of science.

722
00:28:34.853 --> 00:28:35.600
<v ->Right.</v>

723
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.541
<v Interviewer>Science itself, the paradoxes.</v>

724
00:28:37.541 --> 00:28:42.053
Because it's dealing so much in their perceived certainties,

725
00:28:42.053 --> 00:28:45.509
that often the real information simply can't flow through

726
00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:47.109
in the educational system.

727
00:28:47.109 --> 00:28:50.127
Even in the world of science and research.

728
00:28:50.127 --> 00:28:51.503
<v ->Oh, absolutely.</v>

729
00:28:51.503 --> 00:28:55.986
Again, we're so used to looking away from the truth

730
00:28:55.986 --> 00:29:00.145
to find the truth, that even in science it goes ...

731
00:29:00.145 --> 00:29:02.929
Science is going much more rapidly today than it used to,

732
00:29:02.929 --> 00:29:05.734
because we don't accept all assumptions as true

733
00:29:05.734 --> 00:29:06.876
as much as we did.

734
00:29:06.876 --> 00:29:07.569
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

735
00:29:07.569 --> 00:29:08.849
<v ->But we still do it a lot.</v>

736
00:29:08.849 --> 00:29:11.479
And because of that, it slows things down.

737
00:29:11.479 --> 00:29:13.878
If everyone always thought out of the box,

738
00:29:13.878 --> 00:29:15.126
instead of in the box.

739
00:29:15.126 --> 00:29:16.353
Not that you ignore the box.

740
00:29:16.353 --> 00:29:19.169
You don't throw out your wisdom from the past.

741
00:29:19.169 --> 00:29:22.390
But you don't assume that the answer's back there.

742
00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:24.928
You realize the answer's always here now.

743
00:29:24.928 --> 00:29:28.875
So, what is it here now that can provide the solution?

744
00:29:28.875 --> 00:29:31.477
And, if you look, you'll find it.

745
00:29:31.477 --> 00:29:34.976
And it works in every area of your life.

746
00:29:34.976 --> 00:29:37.557
There's ... just a funny aside too.

747
00:29:37.557 --> 00:29:39.946
One of the reasons that we get stuck in life,

748
00:29:39.946 --> 00:29:42.154
is because we're wanting to figure out our problems.

749
00:29:42.154 --> 00:29:44.266
Wanting to understand what to do about them.

750
00:29:44.266 --> 00:29:46.218
Why they're there.

751
00:29:46.218 --> 00:29:47.818
A lot of therapy actually, goes

752
00:29:47.818 --> 00:29:50.740
down that path unsuccessfully.

753
00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:52.532
But, one of the things I discovered

754
00:29:52.532 --> 00:29:54.505
is that the only reason we want to

755
00:29:54.505 --> 00:29:56.692
figure out or understand a problem

756
00:29:56.692 --> 00:29:58.804
is because we're planning to have it again.

757
00:29:58.804 --> 00:29:59.934
<v Interviewer>Exactly.</v>

758
00:29:59.934 --> 00:30:00.958
That's very true.

759
00:30:00.958 --> 00:30:01.779
(laughing)

760
00:30:01.779 --> 00:30:03.209
Otherwise, why bother, it's history.

761
00:30:03.209 --> 00:30:05.043
<v ->Exactly.</v>

762
00:30:05.043 --> 00:30:06.900
<v Interviewer>This is interesting because</v>

763
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.378
when you're talking about that,

764
00:30:08.378 --> 00:30:09.926
when you're talking about science

765
00:30:09.926 --> 00:30:11.970
and the way we've been doing things.

766
00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:14.241
The thing that seems, we all have to overcome

767
00:30:14.241 --> 00:30:17.427
in one way or another, is the resistance our own

768
00:30:17.427 --> 00:30:19.182
beings put up, throw up,

769
00:30:19.182 --> 00:30:21.868
when we try to make these changes.

770
00:30:21.868 --> 00:30:23.970
Can you talk about the essence of that resistance,

771
00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:26.097
as you've seen it over the last twenty, thirty years

772
00:30:26.097 --> 00:30:27.074
in your practice.

773
00:30:27.074 --> 00:30:29.890
Well, the essence of resistance is thinking

774
00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:33.890
that we need to find something away from here and now.

775
00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:36.972
And because of that, we resist change.

776
00:30:36.972 --> 00:30:40.289
And change is on the surface of beingness,

777
00:30:40.289 --> 00:30:43.127
on the surface of what's unfolding here is natural.

778
00:30:43.127 --> 00:30:44.705
Everything is changing all the time,

779
00:30:44.705 --> 00:30:46.956
except that which you are.

780
00:30:46.956 --> 00:30:49.067
That never changes.

781
00:30:49.067 --> 00:30:51.510
When we try to impose that changelessness

782
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:55.552
that we are, on the ever-changing, it's hell.

783
00:30:55.552 --> 00:30:56.779
(laughing)

784
00:30:56.779 --> 00:30:59.286
We go, "No, this river needs to flow this way."

785
00:30:59.286 --> 00:31:01.472
"No, the earth needs to turn a little faster."

786
00:31:01.472 --> 00:31:03.051
That's us, trying to control time.

787
00:31:03.051 --> 00:31:05.696
"This needs to change, that needs to change."

788
00:31:05.696 --> 00:31:08.810
"I wish I could have changed what happened ten years ago."

789
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:12.816
All of that, is resistance to what is.

790
00:31:13.868 --> 00:31:17.931
That resistance to what is, obstructs

791
00:31:17.931 --> 00:31:20.149
our being able to function naturally.

792
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:23.696
However, resistance is just a feeling.

793
00:31:24.193 --> 00:31:25.739
It's not special, it's not meaningful.

794
00:31:25.739 --> 00:31:27.749
It's not important.

795
00:31:27.749 --> 00:31:29.679
With The Sedona Method, you learn

796
00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:32.047
to simply let it go, just like any other feeling.

797
00:31:32.047 --> 00:31:35.321
And when you let go of the feeling of resistance,

798
00:31:35.321 --> 00:31:38.777
you naturally find that you're simply flowing

799
00:31:38.777 --> 00:31:42.542
with the ever-changing unfolding of life.

800
00:31:42.542 --> 00:31:46.435
And you're responding appropriately from moment to moment.

801
00:31:46.435 --> 00:31:48.933
<v Interviewer>And then the intuition can come in.</v>

802
00:31:48.933 --> 00:31:50.437
Then you can allow yourself to start

803
00:31:50.437 --> 00:31:53.061
utilizing the magic that is there in the moment.

804
00:31:53.061 --> 00:31:53.964
<v ->Exactly.</v>

805
00:31:54.831 --> 00:31:57.223
<v Interviewer>You have four areas that you say</v>

806
00:31:57.223 --> 00:31:59.591
are the four big wants that everybody deals with.

807
00:31:59.591 --> 00:32:01.148
We don't have to go in great detail,

808
00:32:01.148 --> 00:32:02.332
but maybe if you can touch on

809
00:32:02.332 --> 00:32:03.676
each one of these big wants.

810
00:32:03.676 --> 00:32:06.108
Which actually end up impeding us often,

811
00:32:06.108 --> 00:32:07.900
from what we're truly desiring.

812
00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.244
<v ->Sure.</v>

813
00:32:09.244 --> 00:32:13.587
What happens is, after we start to think

814
00:32:13.587 --> 00:32:18.587
there is a me and other than me, we go deeper.

815
00:32:20.093 --> 00:32:21.672
One of the first things that happens

816
00:32:21.672 --> 00:32:24.569
is we feel the sense of separation.

817
00:32:25.012 --> 00:32:27.514
And the sense of separation is uncomfortable.

818
00:32:28.864 --> 00:32:30.517
Because we want to get back to that

819
00:32:30.517 --> 00:32:33.717
sense of oneness we had just before.

820
00:32:33.717 --> 00:32:35.808
We've started really buying in to this

821
00:32:35.808 --> 00:32:39.104
sense of me and other than me.

822
00:32:39.104 --> 00:32:40.618
Then a little deeper than that,

823
00:32:40.618 --> 00:32:43.306
is this sense of "I'm this body."

824
00:32:43.306 --> 00:32:45.450
And because I'm this body, not only

825
00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:49.023
am I a person, but I am this person only.

826
00:32:49.023 --> 00:32:52.242
This body, then everything becomes a threat.

827
00:32:53.395 --> 00:32:55.895
A little closer to the surface is,

828
00:32:55.895 --> 00:32:59.703
there's this feeling that if love is

829
00:32:59.703 --> 00:33:02.786
somehow outside of me, and I have to go find it.

830
00:33:02.786 --> 00:33:03.788
<v Interviewer>Yeah.</v>

831
00:33:03.788 --> 00:33:06.316
<v ->Also, if I get enough love, I'll be safe.</v>

832
00:33:06.316 --> 00:33:09.900
Then, mostly at the closest to the surface,

833
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:14.604
is this belief that things aren't right with the world.

834
00:33:14.604 --> 00:33:16.331
I need to fix it, I need to change it.

835
00:33:16.331 --> 00:33:18.693
I need to manipulate it.

836
00:33:18.693 --> 00:33:21.059
As you see through all these beliefs.

837
00:33:21.059 --> 00:33:24.366
As you start to dissolve them in your awareness.

838
00:33:24.366 --> 00:33:29.366
That helps you really be present with what is present

839
00:33:30.051 --> 00:33:31.702
from moment to moment.

840
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:34.918
<v Interviewer>Now this brings us to the big one.</v>

841
00:33:34.918 --> 00:33:38.000
The ability to manifest our lives properly.

842
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:38.694
<v ->Sure</v>

843
00:33:38.694 --> 00:33:40.070
<v Interviewer>The whole notion of "The Secret."</v>

844
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:42.534
It's very interesting, because while you do

845
00:33:42.534 --> 00:33:47.173
need to have clear intention, at the same time

846
00:33:47.173 --> 00:33:50.053
we talk about this acceptance and letting go.

847
00:33:50.053 --> 00:33:51.952
How does the dance ...

848
00:33:52.862 --> 00:33:54.760
Referring to "The Secret," because a lot of

849
00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.851
the viewers that are watching you right now

850
00:33:56.851 --> 00:33:59.038
a lot of our viewers have already seen that.

851
00:33:59.038 --> 00:34:01.544
So, let's talk about how this all works together then.

852
00:34:01.544 --> 00:34:02.685
<v ->Sure.</v>

853
00:34:04.385 --> 00:34:07.551
"The Secret" talks about the law of attraction.

854
00:34:07.551 --> 00:34:09.556
What you put out, comes back to you.

855
00:34:09.556 --> 00:34:13.758
On the level of the appearance that's absolutely true.

856
00:34:13.758 --> 00:34:17.310
The problem is, how most people try to approach

857
00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:22.310
manifestation, is simply by putting a happy face on top.

858
00:34:22.558 --> 00:34:23.784
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

859
00:34:23.784 --> 00:34:26.707
<v ->They feel scarce or they feel lonely.</v>

860
00:34:26.707 --> 00:34:30.376
They feel sick, all these things are inside.

861
00:34:30.376 --> 00:34:34.066
And they're manifesting in their lives.

862
00:34:34.066 --> 00:34:35.997
What they do, is they try to pretend,

863
00:34:35.997 --> 00:34:39.591
or they try to imagine, or they try to affirm

864
00:34:39.591 --> 00:34:41.458
that it's not true, but the mind

865
00:34:41.458 --> 00:34:42.802
just goes to war with that.

866
00:34:42.802 --> 00:34:45.234
And it takes a tremendous amount of effort

867
00:34:45.234 --> 00:34:47.463
and suffering and struggle to try

868
00:34:47.463 --> 00:34:49.415
to make a change that way.

869
00:34:49.415 --> 00:34:51.388
There are miracle stories that are

870
00:34:51.388 --> 00:34:52.998
happening from "The Secret,"

871
00:34:52.998 --> 00:34:54.897
but those are few and far between.

872
00:34:54.897 --> 00:34:58.012
Because, how most people live life,

873
00:34:58.012 --> 00:35:00.102
you can't simply put a happy face on it

874
00:35:00.102 --> 00:35:01.489
and expect everything to change.

875
00:35:01.489 --> 00:35:05.826
'Cause we're manifesting the sum total of our thinkingness.

876
00:35:06.813 --> 00:35:08.498
Ninety-nine percent of our thinkingness

877
00:35:08.498 --> 00:35:10.823
and feelingness is subconscious.

878
00:35:10.823 --> 00:35:13.031
Is below our conscious awareness.

879
00:35:13.031 --> 00:35:17.020
Our thoughts, our feelings, and our behavior

880
00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:21.137
are being motivated by this accumulation.

881
00:35:21.137 --> 00:35:24.177
So, what happens with The Sedona Method

882
00:35:24.177 --> 00:35:27.238
is we show you how to uncover this natural,

883
00:35:27.238 --> 00:35:30.075
creative power that you are.

884
00:35:30.075 --> 00:35:32.763
This natural knowingness that you are.

885
00:35:32.763 --> 00:35:34.907
This natural presence that you are.

886
00:35:34.907 --> 00:35:37.968
Then, just a mere effortless thought ...

887
00:35:37.968 --> 00:35:38.875
(Interviewer coughing)

888
00:35:38.875 --> 00:35:39.568
<v Interviewer>Excuse me.</v>

889
00:35:39.568 --> 00:35:40.453
<v ->No, that's okay.</v>

890
00:35:40.453 --> 00:35:43.355
... manifests either very quickly or immediately.

891
00:35:45.196 --> 00:35:50.091
Again, thoughts are more on the surface than feelings.

892
00:35:50.091 --> 00:35:51.851
Most scientists believe for some reason ...

893
00:35:51.851 --> 00:35:53.483
I don't know, they must have walked around

894
00:35:53.483 --> 00:35:54.806
with one of these clickers, I don't know

895
00:35:54.806 --> 00:35:55.616
how they figured it out.

896
00:35:55.616 --> 00:35:58.358
But we have fifty or sixty thousand thoughts a day.

897
00:35:58.358 --> 00:35:59.861
If you try to control, all those

898
00:35:59.861 --> 00:36:02.261
fifty or sixty thousand thoughts a day,

899
00:36:02.261 --> 00:36:03.488
that's a forever job.

900
00:36:03.488 --> 00:36:05.760
Plus, then you're having thoughts about the thoughts.

901
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.128
You're actually just increasing the accumulation

902
00:36:08.128 --> 00:36:09.941
and you're still walking away from the answer.

903
00:36:09.941 --> 00:36:10.847
(Interviewer laughing)

904
00:36:10.847 --> 00:36:11.615
<v Interviewer>True.</v>

905
00:36:11.615 --> 00:36:12.842
<v ->And you can wake up ...</v>

906
00:36:12.842 --> 00:36:14.101
Everyone's heard this expression.

907
00:36:14.101 --> 00:36:15.914
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

908
00:36:15.914 --> 00:36:17.812
You have that same feeling the whole day.

909
00:36:17.812 --> 00:36:20.394
For a lot of people, it's the same day ...

910
00:36:20.394 --> 00:36:22.431
They woke up on the wrong side of their life.

911
00:36:22.431 --> 00:36:24.479
(laughing)

912
00:36:24.479 --> 00:36:29.022
So the feelings are coloring the thoughts every moment.

913
00:36:29.022 --> 00:36:31.465
When you let go of the feelings,

914
00:36:31.465 --> 00:36:33.950
your thoughts naturally get more positive,

915
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:36.361
without any effort.

916
00:36:36.361 --> 00:36:39.102
In fact, one-third, over one-third

917
00:36:39.102 --> 00:36:42.429
of the teachers in "The Secret,"

918
00:36:42.429 --> 00:36:44.605
are using this process.

919
00:36:44.605 --> 00:36:45.469
<v Interviewer>The Sedona Method?</v>

920
00:36:45.469 --> 00:36:46.419
<v ->The Sedona Method.</v>

921
00:36:46.419 --> 00:36:47.507
<v Interviewer>It makes total sense.</v>

922
00:36:47.507 --> 00:36:48.253
<v ->Yes.</v>

923
00:36:48.253 --> 00:36:49.896
<v Interviewer>Because, I think</v>

924
00:36:49.896 --> 00:36:51.570
most of the people that you run into,

925
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:55.059
"Oh, I saw "The Secret," I'm doing my vision board."

926
00:36:55.059 --> 00:36:57.129
There lives may be absolutely miserable,

927
00:36:57.129 --> 00:36:59.103
but they're going to throw up all the pretty images

928
00:36:59.103 --> 00:37:01.055
from the magazines on the vision board.

929
00:37:01.055 --> 00:37:03.487
I'm not dissing that, I've done it for about

930
00:37:03.487 --> 00:37:07.017
twenty years myself, and manifested incredible things.

931
00:37:07.017 --> 00:37:09.142
But, what you say, is very clear.

932
00:37:09.142 --> 00:37:11.415
You have to also be clear within yourself,

933
00:37:11.415 --> 00:37:12.834
in order for that to start.

934
00:37:12.834 --> 00:37:13.559
<v ->Right.</v>

935
00:37:13.559 --> 00:37:14.508
Well, you don't have to.

936
00:37:14.508 --> 00:37:15.810
You can do the vision board,

937
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:17.879
but it will take a really long time

938
00:37:17.879 --> 00:37:22.503
and add a lot of extra suffering and stress, etc. to it.

939
00:37:22.503 --> 00:37:23.772
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

940
00:37:23.772 --> 00:37:25.200
<v ->All the techniques for visualization ...</v>

941
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.756
<v Interviewer>And then people give up.</v>

942
00:37:26.756 --> 00:37:27.529
<v ->Right, exactly.</v>

943
00:37:27.529 --> 00:37:28.438
Exactly.

944
00:37:28.438 --> 00:37:31.769
Because it adds so much extra work and time to it.

945
00:37:31.769 --> 00:37:34.233
Most people never see it through.

946
00:37:34.233 --> 00:37:37.528
But what happens is, when you use The Sedona Method,

947
00:37:37.528 --> 00:37:41.656
even though time is a concept, you collapse time.

948
00:37:41.656 --> 00:37:44.077
Because you're letting go of all the inner obstructions.

949
00:37:44.077 --> 00:37:46.488
When you let go of all the inner obstructions,

950
00:37:46.488 --> 00:37:50.844
manifestation becomes incredibly simple and easy, and fun.

951
00:37:51.831 --> 00:37:53.783
Part of the power of The Sedona Method,

952
00:37:53.783 --> 00:37:56.077
is we show you how to set your

953
00:37:56.077 --> 00:37:58.583
clear goals and intentions.

954
00:37:58.583 --> 00:38:02.391
And then let go of all the thoughts

955
00:38:02.391 --> 00:38:04.972
and feelings to the contrary.

956
00:38:04.972 --> 00:38:07.457
Because of that, it just simply ...

957
00:38:07.457 --> 00:38:11.432
It's like a vacuum, it pulls it into your awareness.

958
00:38:11.432 --> 00:38:13.180
<v Interviewer>It's beautiful.</v>

959
00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:16.401
I think this whole area, because "The Secret"

960
00:38:16.401 --> 00:38:20.326
has been so, sweeping around through 2006, certainly.

961
00:38:20.326 --> 00:38:23.206
And into 2007, around the internet.

962
00:38:23.206 --> 00:38:26.022
This is probably the easiest place to address

963
00:38:26.022 --> 00:38:29.201
the subject of manifestation, and on that note,

964
00:38:29.201 --> 00:38:32.400
is there anything final about our ability

965
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.683
to create the kind of life we want,

966
00:38:34.683 --> 00:38:36.581
utilizing The Sedona Method.

967
00:38:36.581 --> 00:38:37.669
And we're gonna make sure everybody

968
00:38:37.669 --> 00:38:40.410
knows how to get involved with that, in just a little bit.

969
00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:43.056
Any final thoughts, wrapping this all together?

970
00:38:43.056 --> 00:38:48.056
<v ->Well, first of all, remember that</v>

971
00:38:48.335 --> 00:38:50.959
feelings are just feelings.

972
00:38:50.959 --> 00:38:53.690
They're not facts, and they're not you,

973
00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:55.386
and you can let them go.

974
00:38:55.386 --> 00:38:58.479
One of the important pieces of manifestation

975
00:38:58.479 --> 00:39:02.169
is not just thinking it or seeing it, but feeling it.

976
00:39:02.169 --> 00:39:04.139
That's a very big part of "The Secret."

977
00:39:04.593 --> 00:39:06.214
But the only way that I've found,

978
00:39:06.214 --> 00:39:09.637
where you can really maintain that positive feeling

979
00:39:09.637 --> 00:39:11.919
about your goals and aspirations,

980
00:39:11.919 --> 00:39:13.155
is by letting go.

981
00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.734
If you try to force yourself to feel particular way,

982
00:39:16.734 --> 00:39:18.398
you just get more uncomfortable.

983
00:39:18.398 --> 00:39:20.008
You go to war with yourself.

984
00:39:20.008 --> 00:39:21.768
If you try to think a particular way,

985
00:39:21.768 --> 00:39:23.507
you just go to war with yourself.

986
00:39:23.507 --> 00:39:25.555
But if you let go of the suffering,

987
00:39:25.555 --> 00:39:27.090
if you let go of the doubt,

988
00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:28.477
if you let go of the fear,

989
00:39:28.477 --> 00:39:31.432
if you let go of all the feelings

990
00:39:31.432 --> 00:39:34.585
that are telling you can't have what it is you choose.

991
00:39:35.231 --> 00:39:38.345
Then manifestation becomes really easy.

992
00:39:38.345 --> 00:39:39.721
Really easy.

993
00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:43.893
At the same time, part of our goals process

994
00:39:43.893 --> 00:39:47.627
is about getting to what Lester Levenson called

995
00:39:47.627 --> 00:39:48.789
the "hootless state."

996
00:39:48.789 --> 00:39:50.720
<v Interviewer>Right, I was going to ask you about that.</v>

997
00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:51.786
Hootlessness.

998
00:39:51.786 --> 00:39:52.896
(laughing)

999
00:39:52.896 --> 00:39:53.877
<v ->Well it's a made up word.</v>

1000
00:39:53.877 --> 00:39:55.061
<v Interviewer>Right, exactly.</v>

1001
00:39:55.061 --> 00:39:57.562
<v ->But what he meant by that is this,</v>

1002
00:39:57.562 --> 00:40:00.132
a lot of people tell you you have to be

1003
00:40:00.132 --> 00:40:02.201
really passionate about your goals.

1004
00:40:02.201 --> 00:40:04.783
You really have to want them intently.

1005
00:40:04.783 --> 00:40:08.430
But in my experience, want equates to lack.

1006
00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:09.518
<v Interviewer>Right.</v>

1007
00:40:09.518 --> 00:40:10.628
<v ->Anytime you want something,</v>

1008
00:40:10.628 --> 00:40:11.961
you feel like you don't have it.

1009
00:40:11.961 --> 00:40:14.723
You have to go outside of yourself to get it.

1010
00:40:14.723 --> 00:40:17.624
But when you release with The Sedona Method,

1011
00:40:17.624 --> 00:40:20.110
on any goal, you get to the place where

1012
00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:23.933
you're okay, whether or not you manifest it.

1013
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.652
And two things happen.

1014
00:40:26.469 --> 00:40:30.427
In most cases, that makes it much easier to manifest.

1015
00:40:30.427 --> 00:40:32.006
The other thing that may happen though,

1016
00:40:32.006 --> 00:40:33.552
is you may discover that the goal

1017
00:40:33.552 --> 00:40:35.536
you were going for, wasn't really your goal.

1018
00:40:35.536 --> 00:40:37.467
It was you husband's goal, your wife's goal,

1019
00:40:37.467 --> 00:40:41.061
society's goal, your company's goal.

1020
00:40:41.061 --> 00:40:42.896
All these other outside forces.

1021
00:40:42.896 --> 00:40:45.477
Had nothing to do with what you really wanted.

1022
00:40:45.477 --> 00:40:47.354
So, what you may do, is actually discover

1023
00:40:47.354 --> 00:40:49.978
as you let go, that that isn't your goal.

1024
00:40:49.978 --> 00:40:54.298
Your goal is something much more right for you.

1025
00:40:54.298 --> 00:40:56.854
It clears out the uncertainty.

1026
00:40:57.468 --> 00:40:58.929
You get to a point where you know

1027
00:40:58.929 --> 00:41:01.115
you can create whatever you want,

1028
00:41:01.115 --> 00:41:03.206
but you don't always have to.

1029
00:41:03.206 --> 00:41:05.403
It's okay whether you create it or not.

1030
00:41:06.403 --> 00:41:09.364
What's even more pleasurable about

1031
00:41:09.364 --> 00:41:11.540
the whole experience is that most people

1032
00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.726
experience a tremendous amount of suffering,

1033
00:41:13.726 --> 00:41:15.465
in relationship to goals.

1034
00:41:15.465 --> 00:41:16.393
<v Interviewer>True.</v>

1035
00:41:16.393 --> 00:41:19.648
<v ->I mean ... I even just say goals in our courses</v>

1036
00:41:19.648 --> 00:41:20.597
and a lot of people go ...

1037
00:41:20.597 --> 00:41:21.483
(clenched groaning)

1038
00:41:21.483 --> 00:41:23.381
<v Interviewer>"Don't make me have to set</v>

1039
00:41:23.381 --> 00:41:24.501
more goals to fail.

1040
00:41:24.501 --> 00:41:25.610
(laughing)

1041
00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:26.400
Right.

1042
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.221
'Cause most people fail at them.

1043
00:41:27.221 --> 00:41:29.674
Because the traditional tools for achieving goals

1044
00:41:29.674 --> 00:41:31.818
are action, which is great, but without

1045
00:41:31.818 --> 00:41:34.389
combining it with releasing, it doesn't work as well.

1046
00:41:34.389 --> 00:41:36.831
Or visualization, or affirmation, and both of those

1047
00:41:36.831 --> 00:41:39.380
by themselves, are not as effective as

1048
00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.327
combining them with letting go.

1049
00:41:42.592 --> 00:41:46.304
One of the wonderful things about using The Sedona Method

1050
00:41:46.304 --> 00:41:49.045
to get what you want, to focus on goals,

1051
00:41:49.045 --> 00:41:52.313
is the process itself is extremely pleasurable.

1052
00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.615
That place where you're hootless about

1053
00:41:55.615 --> 00:41:58.254
whether you get it or not, is exquisite.

1054
00:41:58.698 --> 00:42:00.863
You're more likely to get what you want,

1055
00:42:00.863 --> 00:42:05.863
but most people suffer before, during, and even after,

1056
00:42:06.569 --> 00:42:08.382
they've achieved their goals.

1057
00:42:08.382 --> 00:42:11.241
Because, if you get your goal through effort,

1058
00:42:11.241 --> 00:42:15.123
if you get your goal through forcing and suffering,

1059
00:42:15.123 --> 00:42:17.182
you're already losing it as soon as you get it.

1060
00:42:17.182 --> 00:42:18.718
Because you feel like you have to protect it,

1061
00:42:18.718 --> 00:42:20.478
you're not sure of yourself.

1062
00:42:20.478 --> 00:42:21.992
You know it was so hard to create,

1063
00:42:21.992 --> 00:42:23.667
you don't know if you can create it again.

1064
00:42:23.667 --> 00:42:25.245
On and on and on.

1065
00:42:25.245 --> 00:42:27.378
But when you're okay, whether you create it or not,

1066
00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:30.066
then some goals happen and some goals don't.

1067
00:42:30.066 --> 00:42:33.554
But you feel whole, complete, and enough

1068
00:42:33.554 --> 00:42:36.318
within yourself, throughout the whole process.

1069
00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.735
<v Interviewer>Well that sums it up beautifully.</v>

1070
00:42:38.735 --> 00:42:40.665
Thank you so much for taking some time

1071
00:42:40.665 --> 00:42:42.031
to talk with us today.

1072
00:42:42.031 --> 00:42:43.311
I know it's going to do a lot of good

1073
00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:45.569
for a lot of us watching this.

1074
00:42:46.599 --> 00:42:50.256
We'll go ahead and put your website up.

1075
00:42:50.256 --> 00:42:51.006
<v ->Great.</v>

1076
00:42:51.006 --> 00:42:52.259
<v Interviewer>So everyone can see</v>

1077
00:42:52.259 --> 00:42:53.141
how to get a hold of you.

1078
00:42:53.141 --> 00:42:54.401
And how often do you have ...

1079
00:42:54.401 --> 00:42:56.000
I assume you have people conducting workshops

1080
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.442
all over the world right now?

1081
00:42:57.442 --> 00:42:58.167
<v ->Yes.</v>

1082
00:42:58.167 --> 00:42:59.553
We have workshops all over the world.

1083
00:42:59.553 --> 00:43:01.367
Then we have an audio program.

1084
00:43:01.367 --> 00:43:02.924
Most people learn The Sedona Method

1085
00:43:02.924 --> 00:43:04.801
either through The Sedona Method book

1086
00:43:04.801 --> 00:43:06.774
or through our audio program.

1087
00:43:06.774 --> 00:43:09.099
Actually, most people learn it through the audio program.

1088
00:43:09.839 --> 00:43:12.419
The audio program, really takes you step by step

1089
00:43:12.419 --> 00:43:14.201
through the process, so that you can

1090
00:43:14.201 --> 00:43:16.387
start to incorporate this into your life.

1091
00:43:16.387 --> 00:43:18.083
<v Interviewer>And you don't wanna rush this, right?</v>

1092
00:43:18.083 --> 00:43:19.054
<v ->No, there's no rush.</v>

1093
00:43:19.054 --> 00:43:19.768
(laughing)

1094
00:43:19.768 --> 00:43:21.017
<v Interviewer>It's not something where you</v>

1095
00:43:21.017 --> 00:43:21.962
read the book and you think I had a weekend,

1096
00:43:21.962 --> 00:43:23.312
I read that,that was great.

1097
00:43:23.312 --> 00:43:24.037
<v ->Right.</v>

1098
00:43:24.037 --> 00:43:25.203
<v Interviewer>It's not that kind of experience.</v>

1099
00:43:25.203 --> 00:43:27.400
<v ->No, actually one of the unique things</v>

1100
00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.053
about The Sedona Method, compared to

1101
00:43:29.053 --> 00:43:31.165
other self-help tools, is the results

1102
00:43:31.165 --> 00:43:32.878
actually increase over time.

1103
00:43:33.513 --> 00:43:36.233
Years ago, we did a study with the MONY Corporation,

1104
00:43:36.233 --> 00:43:39.571
Mutual of New York, and the field underwriters

1105
00:43:39.571 --> 00:43:41.640
that took The Sedona Method, outperformed

1106
00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:44.382
the control group by thirty-three percent.

1107
00:43:44.382 --> 00:43:47.859
The results went up by one-third, which is huge in sales.

1108
00:43:47.859 --> 00:43:50.557
But even more impressive was, it was broken down

1109
00:43:50.557 --> 00:43:53.085
into two three-month study groups.

1110
00:43:53.085 --> 00:43:53.874
The first three months,

1111
00:43:53.874 --> 00:43:55.965
the results went up twenty-two percent.

1112
00:43:55.965 --> 00:43:57.127
The second three months,

1113
00:43:57.127 --> 00:43:59.698
the results went up forty-four percent.

1114
00:43:59.698 --> 00:44:01.767
The average was thirty-three percent,

1115
00:44:01.767 --> 00:44:05.532
but their results actually went up over time.

1116
00:44:05.532 --> 00:44:08.273
Again, because we're showing you

1117
00:44:08.273 --> 00:44:11.174
how to change yourself from the inside out.

1118
00:44:11.174 --> 00:44:13.265
Most self-help is about trying to change yourself

1119
00:44:13.265 --> 00:44:17.074
from the outside in and it doesn't last.

1120
00:44:17.074 --> 00:44:18.834
(smooth jazz keyboard)

1121
00:44:18.834 --> 00:44:20.064
<v Interviewer>As Hale said, about a third</v>

1122
00:44:20.064 --> 00:44:22.274
of the people seen in the film, "The Secret,"

1123
00:44:22.274 --> 00:44:23.992
use this direct and simple method

1124
00:44:23.992 --> 00:44:26.200
of releasing the blocks in our consciousness.

1125
00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.501
So if you decide to give it a try,

1126
00:44:27.501 --> 00:44:28.898
you'll be in good company.

1127
00:44:28.898 --> 00:44:30.615
Meanwhile, if you're working on releasing

1128
00:44:30.615 --> 00:44:32.962
negative self-talk, you might also enjoy

1129
00:44:32.962 --> 00:44:36.578
the work of Byron Katie and Robert Tennyson Stevens,

1130
00:44:36.578 --> 00:44:38.209
both of whom are on this site.

1131
00:44:38.209 --> 00:44:40.972
Until next time, thanks for watching.

1132
00:44:40.972 --> 00:44:42.671
