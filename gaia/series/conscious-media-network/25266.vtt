00:00:00.427 --> 00:00:02.650 line:15% 
(light, uplifting music)

2
00:00:05.342 --> 00:00:07.742
<v ->How many times have you looked at a given painting,</v>

3
00:00:07.742 --> 00:00:10.015
situation or even object, and suddenly

4
00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:11.475
seen something new in it?

5
00:00:11.475 --> 00:00:14.814
Something that had been sitting in plain sight all along.

6
00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:16.499
This is always a bit of a shock as we wonder

7
00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:18.451
why we couldn't see it to begin with.

8
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.157
Well, many people have the same reaction

9
00:00:20.157 --> 00:00:22.738
when exposed to Dr. John Rush's newest book,

10
00:00:22.738 --> 00:00:25.842
"Mushroom in Christian Art." Yep, mushrooms.

11
00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:27.816
When John and other academics began seeing

12
00:00:27.816 --> 00:00:30.269
the images of mushrooms surrounding Jesus

13
00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.327
and embedded in the folding of his clothes

14
00:00:32.327 --> 00:00:34.695
and in church stained glass and so forth,

15
00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:37.447
an astounding array of questions was posed.

16
00:00:37.447 --> 00:00:39.740
This connection between psychoactive mushrooms

17
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.103
and Jesus is the subject of this fascinating work.

18
00:00:44.103 --> 00:00:47.036
John, I don't think I'm the first person to have pondered

19
00:00:47.036 --> 00:00:51.356
even as a young one how these people in times past

20
00:00:51.356 --> 00:00:54.673
were able to access certain visions and so forth.

21
00:00:54.673 --> 00:00:56.667
And the whole notion that we so readily accept

22
00:00:56.667 --> 00:01:01.667
visions as fact throughout our various religious texts.

23
00:01:01.947 --> 00:01:04.528
I've always found fascinating just in and of itself.

24
00:01:04.528 --> 00:01:07.450
But, then, you're taking that to a different level

25
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.480
that actually makes more sense to me.

26
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.730
There's a way to expand the mind and have visions

27
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.354
and I think most of the people watching this

28
00:01:15.354 --> 00:01:18.118
would already be on board with that concept.

29
00:01:18.118 --> 00:01:20.410
<v ->Yeah, it's an age-old phenomenon</v>

30
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.522
of using these substances.

31
00:01:22.522 --> 00:01:26.873
I think probably one of the first to sciences was botany.

32
00:01:26.873 --> 00:01:29.593
Our ancient ancestors, particularly Homo erectus

33
00:01:29.593 --> 00:01:32.377
leaving Africa would have bumped into new foods.

34
00:01:32.377 --> 00:01:33.966
They weren't fussy about what they ate,

35
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:36.825
and they tried a lot of things.

36
00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:38.958
And certainly, they would've bumped into cannabis,

37
00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:42.070
they would've bumped into these different types of

38
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.915
mind-altering mushrooms and so on.

39
00:01:43.915 --> 00:01:46.880
There's just a lot of plants out there that would be

40
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.401
a part of their everyday habitat that they would

41
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:53.442
wander through, and they would try these things.

42
00:01:55.424 --> 00:01:59.826
They probably early on would not have connected the mushroom

43
00:01:59.826 --> 00:02:01.896
to any type of deity or anything like that,

44
00:02:01.896 --> 00:02:03.602
but, it was a means to an end.

45
00:02:03.602 --> 00:02:05.799
It was a conduit to get there.

46
00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.799
And we can see in the ancient shamans,

47
00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.778
particularly in the caves in France and Spain,

48
00:02:13.778 --> 00:02:16.715
the images of the shaman.

49
00:02:16.715 --> 00:02:21.715
At the Trois FrÃ¨res Cave, for example,

50
00:02:21.818 --> 00:02:26.818
we see a shaman dressed in an animal suit, and so on.

51
00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:30.565
This would be a way to commune with the other side,

52
00:02:30.565 --> 00:02:33.146
or to make the animals come back for another meal,

53
00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:34.595
of course the other a meal.

54
00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:36.397
But, you need to have them come back.

55
00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:37.399
And then, as time goes on,

56
00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:41.719
we get into agriculture and the story changes,

57
00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:45.463
the myth changes to match up with agriculture.

58
00:02:45.463 --> 00:02:47.351
And these people continued to use these.

59
00:02:47.351 --> 00:02:49.868
I mean anything useful is going to stick around.

60
00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:51.948
And these people wouldn't have understood

61
00:02:51.948 --> 00:02:56.716
the chemicals in these mushrooms or plants,

62
00:02:56.716 --> 00:02:58.732
and they would've thought that it was a way

63
00:02:58.732 --> 00:03:02.124
to deal with God, and it never stopped.

64
00:03:02.124 --> 00:03:06.384
We go from shamans to priests, if you will.

65
00:03:06.384 --> 00:03:11.103
When you get into the literature of ancient Mesopotamia,

66
00:03:11.103 --> 00:03:15.551
Sumer and so forth, all the kings had connected to

67
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:19.774
the courts soothsayers or seers or priests,

68
00:03:19.774 --> 00:03:21.374
we can call them that.

69
00:03:21.374 --> 00:03:23.379
And they looked to these priests to commune with

70
00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.491
the other side to come back with a message

71
00:03:25.491 --> 00:03:28.340
that he would then bring to the people.

72
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.014
And then, of course, the king would act

73
00:03:30.014 --> 00:03:31.102
on that message and you know,

74
00:03:31.102 --> 00:03:32.628
"I'm sorry I have to torture you,

75
00:03:32.628 --> 00:03:35.056
"but the God told me to do it so I'll do it."

76
00:03:35.056 --> 00:03:36.393
So, they're off the hook in terms of

77
00:03:36.393 --> 00:03:38.483
really anything that they did.

78
00:03:38.483 --> 00:03:40.819
<v Regina>No liability when in that state.</v>

79
00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.154
<v ->No liability whatsoever.</v>

80
00:03:42.154 --> 00:03:47.154
And you get people thinking that when they read these texts,

81
00:03:47.721 --> 00:03:50.952
whether it's the Bible or the Koran even,

82
00:03:50.952 --> 00:03:52.947
that they're reading history.

83
00:03:52.947 --> 00:03:55.795
It's not history, and it's a mistake to read it that way.

84
00:03:55.795 --> 00:03:59.336
There's bits and pieces of history in it, but, we can see,

85
00:03:59.336 --> 00:04:03.527
or at least I can see, for example, the Old Testament.

86
00:04:03.527 --> 00:04:05.127
They didn't start assembling that thing

87
00:04:05.127 --> 00:04:08.788
until probably after 586 BC.

88
00:04:08.788 --> 00:04:11.079
So, they were exiled to Babylon.

89
00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.087
They were there for 26 years, they picked up the stories.

90
00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.081
<v Regina>We're talking 18, 20 generations after</v>

91
00:04:16.081 --> 00:04:18.353
supposedly the time of Christ, for example.

92
00:04:18.353 --> 00:04:22.758
<v ->Yeah, right. This would be a time period</v>

93
00:04:22.758 --> 00:04:24.817
of upheaval for them.

94
00:04:24.817 --> 00:04:26.417
They have to start wondering why

95
00:04:26.417 --> 00:04:27.675
they're getting beat up all the time.

96
00:04:27.675 --> 00:04:28.933
Of course, they couldn't get along with anybody

97
00:04:28.933 --> 00:04:30.213
because they thought they were the best thing

98
00:04:30.213 --> 00:04:32.528
on the face of the planet.

99
00:04:32.528 --> 00:04:37.295
And during their exile to Babylon, in that 26 years,

100
00:04:37.295 --> 00:04:39.109
they picked up a lot of the stories that,

101
00:04:39.109 --> 00:04:40.367
you know, are ancient.

102
00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:42.927
You know, the Noah story and so on.

103
00:04:42.927 --> 00:04:44.751
And then, they incorporated them in.

104
00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:48.823
But, most of the deities and most of the rituals

105
00:04:48.823 --> 00:04:50.188
come out of Egypt.

106
00:04:50.188 --> 00:04:52.380
And I say that because they lived in Egypt

107
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.652
for hundreds and hundreds of years.

108
00:04:54.652 --> 00:04:58.108
And we can read between the lines

109
00:04:58.108 --> 00:04:59.996
and actually some of the literature,

110
00:04:59.996 --> 00:05:04.027
as you've read in the book, indicates people

111
00:05:04.027 --> 00:05:06.097
using some sort of substance.

112
00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:08.657
You know, the "smoke in the tent" business,

113
00:05:08.657 --> 00:05:10.683
this type of thing.

114
00:05:10.683 --> 00:05:13.595
So, it's an age-old phenomena.

115
00:05:13.595 --> 00:05:16.974
The people didn't understand what was in these substances.

116
00:05:16.974 --> 00:05:18.680
And therefore, they thought they were

117
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.443
communing with God, or at least the other side.

118
00:05:21.443 --> 00:05:25.101
<v Regina>And just from another perspective,</v>

119
00:05:25.101 --> 00:05:28.760
it's not to say that there aren't people who can see things.

120
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.621
There are seers, but, there are also those in, say,

121
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:36.993
a given populace that can see as a result of having

122
00:05:36.993 --> 00:05:38.914
the aid of something that can loosen them

123
00:05:38.914 --> 00:05:40.021
from their everyday mind.

124
00:05:40.021 --> 00:05:40.853
<v ->Right.</v>

125
00:05:40.853 --> 00:05:42.783
<v Regina>No doubt, and this happens all the time.</v>

126
00:05:42.783 --> 00:05:45.407
Even today of course, people go on sacred journeys

127
00:05:45.407 --> 00:05:49.289
down into areas and South America to do Ayahuasca,

128
00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:50.751
and that's a very popular thing.

129
00:05:50.751 --> 00:05:52.372
Graham Hancock, we've interviewed him

130
00:05:52.372 --> 00:05:53.492
a couple of times on this.

131
00:05:53.492 --> 00:05:58.492
So, the desire to expand the mind I would think

132
00:05:58.793 --> 00:06:01.129
is something that's innate to the human condition.

133
00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:02.771
<v ->I believe, yeah.</v>

134
00:06:02.771 --> 00:06:04.584
<v Regina>However you do that, however that happens.</v>

135
00:06:04.584 --> 00:06:06.632
<v ->Yeah, Wade Davis made that point years ago</v>

136
00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:09.683
that it seems to be another sense that

137
00:06:09.683 --> 00:06:11.616
we have to alter our conscious.

138
00:06:11.616 --> 00:06:13.141
<v ->Little kids do it, they just do it,</v>

139
00:06:13.141 --> 00:06:14.112
<v Regina>That's right.</v>

140
00:06:14.112 --> 00:06:15.488
they get on the lawn, they spin around.

141
00:06:15.488 --> 00:06:16.651
They fall down, they laugh, you know.

142
00:06:16.651 --> 00:06:19.989
So, it is part of our need, a human need

143
00:06:19.989 --> 00:06:21.738
to alter our consciousness.

144
00:06:21.738 --> 00:06:23.178
Now, you're right, there are people

145
00:06:23.178 --> 00:06:25.845
who don't need substances to see.

146
00:06:25.845 --> 00:06:27.349
But, we're dealing with brain chemistry,

147
00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:28.447
so, that makes sense, too.

148
00:06:28.447 --> 00:06:30.847
I mean your brain chemistry's different than mine

149
00:06:30.847 --> 00:06:33.140
and Scott's and so on and so forth.

150
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.206
We're all different with this.

151
00:06:34.206 --> 00:06:37.961
And some people are more tuned to it than others.

152
00:06:37.961 --> 00:06:40.061
That's not to say that some of the people

153
00:06:40.061 --> 00:06:43.591
that they reference in the Bible weren't, you know,

154
00:06:43.591 --> 00:06:45.566
maybe they did this on their own.

155
00:06:45.566 --> 00:06:48.925
It seems to me though. that these people

156
00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:53.329
who have these experiences on their own without substances,

157
00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:54.951
you have to wait for that to happen.

158
00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:56.558
<v Regina>Yeah, it's not something that would just...</v>

159
00:06:56.558 --> 00:06:58.786
<v ->Right. And when the culture is in need,</v>

160
00:06:58.786 --> 00:07:00.290
you need something that will take you

161
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.464
to the other side so you can get that message.

162
00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.629
If the culture's in trouble, you've got to go to

163
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:07.477
some other place to get the boon, the message

164
00:07:07.477 --> 00:07:10.334
to bring the culture back into balance.

165
00:07:10.334 --> 00:07:12.436
<v Regina>Now, when you started looking at the mushroom</v>

166
00:07:12.436 --> 00:07:17.047
in Christian art, which we'll introduce at this point,

167
00:07:17.047 --> 00:07:22.047
did you start noticing historical evidence of change

168
00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:25.985
or upheaval at the time a lot of this pops up in the art?

169
00:07:25.985 --> 00:07:28.137
No pun intended, (laughs) but, the mushrooms,

170
00:07:28.137 --> 00:07:29.893
does it kind of go hand-in-hand that there was

171
00:07:29.893 --> 00:07:33.755
more seeing and vision work being done at a time when

172
00:07:33.755 --> 00:07:38.106
a particular cult or culture was experiencing some stress

173
00:07:38.106 --> 00:07:41.701
and had to essentially blossom or die?

174
00:07:41.701 --> 00:07:43.655
<v ->Yeah. I totally agree with that.</v>

175
00:07:43.655 --> 00:07:47.044
Most of these (clears throat) the writings, if you will,

176
00:07:47.044 --> 00:07:50.234
that we see in the Old Testament and the New Testament

177
00:07:50.234 --> 00:07:52.569
came out of extreme social stress.

178
00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:54.404
Like what's going on over in Egypt;

179
00:07:54.404 --> 00:07:57.625
I would not be a bit surprised if we don't start getting

180
00:07:57.625 --> 00:07:59.544
another myth that comes out of that

181
00:07:59.544 --> 00:08:01.486
as to why that's going on and so on.

182
00:08:01.486 --> 00:08:04.089
People seeing visions or whatever that goes with it.

183
00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:06.105
So, stress is an important component.

184
00:08:06.105 --> 00:08:08.152
When people aren't stressed and everything's fine

185
00:08:08.152 --> 00:08:09.517
and everything is in balance or whatever,

186
00:08:09.517 --> 00:08:10.594
you know, nothing happens.

187
00:08:10.594 --> 00:08:11.810
<v Regina>You don't tend to seek anything</v>

188
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:12.845
because you're comfortable.

189
00:08:12.845 --> 00:08:13.698
<v ->Right.</v>

190
00:08:13.698 --> 00:08:14.797
<v Regina>So, that makes sense,</v>

191
00:08:14.797 --> 00:08:15.714
and that's happening right now.

192
00:08:15.714 --> 00:08:17.037
People are seeking, expanding their consciousness

193
00:08:17.037 --> 00:08:18.071
in every way possible.

194
00:08:18.071 --> 00:08:21.890
<v ->Absolutely, 1960's and the early 70's, right.</v>

195
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.546
<v Regina>So, let's go back now into</v>

196
00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:26.380
the mushrooms in Christian art.

197
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.015
And I saw your lecture, I attended one of your

198
00:08:29.015 --> 00:08:31.148
college lectures about two months ago.

199
00:08:31.148 --> 00:08:34.422
And I was very curious about this, but, I have to say

200
00:08:34.422 --> 00:08:37.804
it was really kind of jaw-dropping to see something

201
00:08:37.804 --> 00:08:40.929
in some of those plates so obvious,

202
00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:44.406
and yet at the same time, it's not anything

203
00:08:44.406 --> 00:08:45.804
I would have questioned had I seen it

204
00:08:45.804 --> 00:08:48.375
before understanding this particular topic.

205
00:08:48.375 --> 00:08:49.846
I wouldn't have questioned why mushrooms

206
00:08:49.846 --> 00:08:54.210
pop up around the base of Jesus's or Moses

207
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.364
or whomever's robes.

208
00:08:56.364 --> 00:09:01.121
And in church art in general, even in stained glass,

209
00:09:01.121 --> 00:09:03.840
having mushrooms pop up in a scene.

210
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:08.256
I've never questioned why mushrooms are there. (laughs)

211
00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:09.515
<v ->Well, you don't expect it.</v>

212
00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:12.949
When you go into St. Mark's Basilica, it's so busy,

213
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:14.656
that you wouldn't know what to look for.

214
00:09:14.656 --> 00:09:16.362
Not only that, when you go into St. Mark's,

215
00:09:16.362 --> 00:09:17.760
I mean you're like cattle.

216
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.844
<v Regina>Yeah, that's true.</v>

217
00:09:19.844 --> 00:09:20.863
<v John>They kind of troop you through and get out,</v>

218
00:09:20.863 --> 00:09:22.100
you know, and bring in the next group.

219
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.028
And so you don't really have

220
00:09:23.028 --> 00:09:24.393
an awful lot of time to look at it.

221
00:09:24.393 --> 00:09:25.876
Well, I took pictures.

222
00:09:25.876 --> 00:09:28.457
So, when I got back to California after

223
00:09:28.457 --> 00:09:30.505
doing research here, there, and everywhere,

224
00:09:30.505 --> 00:09:32.339
I started looking at these images

225
00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:34.792
and blowing them up and taking a closer look.

226
00:09:34.792 --> 00:09:37.278
But, the starting point for all of this,

227
00:09:37.278 --> 00:09:39.891
the starting point really is John Allegro in his book,

228
00:09:39.891 --> 00:09:41.800
"The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross,"

229
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.270
which came out in 1970.

230
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.601
I was a graduate student at the time.

231
00:09:47.601 --> 00:09:50.513
I didn't exactly know what to think about it,

232
00:09:50.513 --> 00:09:53.681
but, I kept my eyes open for these things.

233
00:09:53.681 --> 00:09:55.569
He had one picture in the book which could be

234
00:09:55.569 --> 00:09:59.248
easily discredited, in a sense that they could say,

235
00:09:59.248 --> 00:10:00.563
"Oh, it's pagan art that just happened to be

236
00:10:00.563 --> 00:10:02.129
"left there because no one wanted to destroy it,"

237
00:10:02.129 --> 00:10:03.516
or whatever it was.

238
00:10:03.516 --> 00:10:08.516
But when I walked into St. Mark's Basilica and I saw Jesus

239
00:10:09.467 --> 00:10:13.596
with the mushroom in his hands surrounded by mushrooms...

240
00:10:13.596 --> 00:10:14.512
(Regina laughs)

241
00:10:14.512 --> 00:10:16.037
<v ->My God, I mean I had to you know...</v>

242
00:10:16.037 --> 00:10:17.019
<v Regina>You can't ignore that.</v>

243
00:10:17.019 --> 00:10:18.527
<v ->I can't ignore it.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

244
00:10:18.527 --> 00:10:23.527
<v ->And so, beginning in 2001 up until,</v>

245
00:10:24.137 --> 00:10:26.835
well, I guess the book went into publication.

246
00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:28.253
The first one, the "Failed God" book

247
00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:31.560
went into publication in 2008.

248
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.617
I've collected thousands of images.

249
00:10:33.617 --> 00:10:35.729
And not only that, I have friends who have

250
00:10:35.729 --> 00:10:40.124
hundreds and hundreds of images and they're not duplicates.

251
00:10:40.124 --> 00:10:42.278
I mean so, they're probably in all,

252
00:10:42.278 --> 00:10:43.740
at least with some of my friends,

253
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.203
we've probably got 4,000 images of this.

254
00:10:46.203 --> 00:10:47.441
These need to be explained.

255
00:10:47.441 --> 00:10:49.575
Now, my explanation may not be correct.

256
00:10:49.575 --> 00:10:50.469
<v Regina>Right.</v>

257
00:10:50.469 --> 00:10:52.539
<v ->But, we need to explain why the mushroom is there</v>

258
00:10:52.539 --> 00:10:55.419
because it's been ignored by the art historians

259
00:10:55.419 --> 00:10:58.021
for one reason or another; either political correctness

260
00:10:58.021 --> 00:11:01.989
or fear of losing their academic standing, I can't say.

261
00:11:01.989 --> 00:11:03.386
<v Regina>Well, some of them though,</v>

262
00:11:03.386 --> 00:11:06.704
you have to be headed in the right direction.

263
00:11:06.704 --> 00:11:09.900
The one on the cover of your book, for example,

264
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.051
with four different types of mushrooms,

265
00:11:12.051 --> 00:11:14.473
including a distinctly blue mushroom,

266
00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:16.529
notably I assume that's psilocybin.

267
00:11:16.529 --> 00:11:17.339
<v ->Probably, yeah.</v>

268
00:11:17.339 --> 00:11:19.089
<v Regina>And you have to wonder,</v>

269
00:11:19.089 --> 00:11:20.912
not just a mushroom, but, in the foreground,

270
00:11:20.912 --> 00:11:22.875
four different varieties of mushroom.

271
00:11:22.875 --> 00:11:25.168
The attention is being drawn to the mushroom

272
00:11:25.168 --> 00:11:26.789
in this particular scene.

273
00:11:26.789 --> 00:11:28.890
<v ->Yeah. So, the issue is what does it mean?</v>

274
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.933
And to me, these would be esoteric rites that

275
00:11:32.933 --> 00:11:35.231
the priests would be introduced to as they

276
00:11:35.231 --> 00:11:38.025
went up the scale, as they had more and more experience,

277
00:11:38.025 --> 00:11:39.412
and they would be brought in and they'd say,

278
00:11:39.412 --> 00:11:41.407
"Look at this image, tell me what's in the image."

279
00:11:41.407 --> 00:11:44.616
And with part of their ritual training to try to

280
00:11:44.616 --> 00:11:46.388
figure out what it's all about.

281
00:11:46.388 --> 00:11:50.353
At least that's my opinion, I may be wrong with all of this.

282
00:11:50.353 --> 00:11:54.897
But, I think the mushrooms are in the art

283
00:11:54.897 --> 00:11:57.543
for several reasons.

284
00:11:57.543 --> 00:11:59.548
Not only for training priests, but,

285
00:11:59.548 --> 00:12:04.524
I think the mushroom is the signature of God,

286
00:12:04.524 --> 00:12:06.796
because He's the one that inspired the art.

287
00:12:06.796 --> 00:12:08.855
Most of the art that you bump into

288
00:12:08.855 --> 00:12:12.428
over a period of 1,500, 1,600 years,

289
00:12:12.428 --> 00:12:15.424
there's no signature on it, you don't know did it.

290
00:12:15.424 --> 00:12:17.707
A lot of these were made in factories.

291
00:12:17.707 --> 00:12:19.742
The art is all commissioned.

292
00:12:19.742 --> 00:12:22.408
The motifs are all standard.

293
00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:25.437
There's no frivolity here.

294
00:12:25.437 --> 00:12:27.443
The artists themselves wouldn't dare put something

295
00:12:27.443 --> 00:12:30.205
in there that the pope or the bishop or the priest...

296
00:12:30.205 --> 00:12:31.666
<v Regina>Would disapprove of, sure.</v>

297
00:12:31.666 --> 00:12:32.786
<v ->They would be in a lot of trouble</v>

298
00:12:32.786 --> 00:12:34.216
to do something like that.

299
00:12:34.216 --> 00:12:36.882
And so, they're there not for whimsy,

300
00:12:36.882 --> 00:12:38.684
not just happenstance or whatever,

301
00:12:38.684 --> 00:12:40.188
they're there because they're motifs

302
00:12:40.188 --> 00:12:42.521
and they're there to communicate something.

303
00:12:42.521 --> 00:12:45.285
<v Regina>And I was reading one part of the book</v>

304
00:12:45.285 --> 00:12:47.418
where you mentioned that Joseph Campbell said

305
00:12:47.418 --> 00:12:51.245
it was the artist and the shaman throughout history

306
00:12:51.245 --> 00:12:53.911
which were the ones that preserved the icons

307
00:12:53.911 --> 00:12:57.762
and the embedded data, the encoded data.

308
00:12:57.762 --> 00:12:58.562
<v ->That's right.</v>

309
00:12:58.562 --> 00:12:59.478
<v Regina>A lot of it secret.</v>

310
00:12:59.478 --> 00:13:02.764
<v ->They kept the traditions alive, the original traditions.</v>

311
00:13:02.764 --> 00:13:05.686
The original tradition connected to Jesus,

312
00:13:05.686 --> 00:13:07.808
who I don't believe was a real person,

313
00:13:07.808 --> 00:13:09.558
but, it doesn't make any difference if he was or not,

314
00:13:09.558 --> 00:13:10.817
it's what he said.

315
00:13:10.817 --> 00:13:14.827
And if you read closely the Gospels in the New Testament,

316
00:13:14.827 --> 00:13:18.464
plus if you get into the Gnostic Gospels and so on,

317
00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:21.919
what you're seeing is that what was being said is

318
00:13:21.919 --> 00:13:26.238
be a decent person, seek knowledge, know yourself,

319
00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:29.673
emotional responsibility and behavioral responsibility,

320
00:13:29.673 --> 00:13:31.646
that was all that was said there.

321
00:13:31.646 --> 00:13:32.787
And of course, they couldn't sell that

322
00:13:32.787 --> 00:13:35.507
to the Roman government, they weren't going to

323
00:13:35.507 --> 00:13:37.799
be decent to anybody, so, it didn't stick.

324
00:13:37.799 --> 00:13:40.563
I'm not sure the message would stick today.

325
00:13:40.563 --> 00:13:42.963
Let's be decent people.
<v Regina>Right.</v>

326
00:13:42.963 --> 00:13:45.512
<v ->Well, a lot of people out there, thugs, if you will,</v>

327
00:13:45.512 --> 00:13:46.952
that want to control everything,

328
00:13:46.952 --> 00:13:48.584
so, it's not necessarily going to work.

329
00:13:48.584 --> 00:13:52.349
So, what happened, at least in my interpretation of this,

330
00:13:52.349 --> 00:13:56.734
by the early part of the fourth century,

331
00:13:56.734 --> 00:13:58.622
once some of the Christian cults

332
00:13:58.622 --> 00:14:02.237
became connected to the politic through Constantine,

333
00:14:02.237 --> 00:14:05.874
who I don't believe ever became a Christian.

334
00:14:05.874 --> 00:14:07.645
Constantine, what he was doing was

335
00:14:07.645 --> 00:14:08.904
saying to some of these groups,

336
00:14:08.904 --> 00:14:11.869
"You either settle down and join me,

337
00:14:11.869 --> 00:14:13.745
"or I'll get rid of all of you."

338
00:14:13.745 --> 00:14:15.452
And so, some of them saw an opportunity

339
00:14:15.452 --> 00:14:16.764
to connect themselves to the government

340
00:14:16.764 --> 00:14:19.696
and get some tax privileges.

341
00:14:19.696 --> 00:14:20.934
And that's what they did,

342
00:14:20.934 --> 00:14:23.409
and once they did that, they couldn't...

343
00:14:23.409 --> 00:14:25.947
Eusebius of Caeserea, for example,

344
00:14:25.947 --> 00:14:29.606
he couldn't find Jesus in the literature anywhere.

345
00:14:29.606 --> 00:14:32.251
Now, if this was a person who was, you know,

346
00:14:32.251 --> 00:14:34.202
raising people from the dead, healing the sick

347
00:14:34.202 --> 00:14:37.157
all over the place and doing these magical things,

348
00:14:37.157 --> 00:14:39.066
there would be evidence from him.

349
00:14:39.066 --> 00:14:42.106
He couldn't find any, so, he forged him into history.

350
00:14:42.106 --> 00:14:45.573
And we see this in Josephus's Jewish wars.

351
00:14:45.573 --> 00:14:49.135
There's a little brief paragraph in there about Jesus.

352
00:14:49.135 --> 00:14:52.410
The earlier editions of Josephus's work, it's not in there.

353
00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.340
And so, we know it's a forgery, and a lot of people

354
00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.081
attribute it to Eusebius.

355
00:14:57.081 --> 00:15:00.761
And so, once they connected it to the politic,

356
00:15:00.761 --> 00:15:04.228
what happened was the original message of human decency;

357
00:15:04.228 --> 00:15:07.182
know thyself, seek knowledge and whatever was perverted

358
00:15:07.182 --> 00:15:10.113
into a form of reformed Judaisim, really what it is.

359
00:15:10.113 --> 00:15:14.688
<v Regina>Right. And so, now let's get into,</v>

360
00:15:14.688 --> 00:15:18.389
that was around the fourth century.

361
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:20.629
Let's start talking about the ways in which

362
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:23.167
it started surfacing throughout the art, the mushroom,

363
00:15:23.167 --> 00:15:25.845
but, also some of the characters that

364
00:15:25.845 --> 00:15:27.327
you mentioned in the book were,

365
00:15:27.327 --> 00:15:28.532
I have this written down here.

366
00:15:28.532 --> 00:15:32.820
One was Apollinaris and the other...

367
00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.561
Well, let's talk about some of the other characters

368
00:15:35.561 --> 00:15:38.249
that you're saying are kind of allegorical

369
00:15:38.249 --> 00:15:40.403
to Christ's story as well.

370
00:15:40.403 --> 00:15:42.942
And you can even start from Egyptian times,

371
00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:46.668
and carry that forward as well.

372
00:15:46.668 --> 00:15:48.418
what are the characteristics where it keeps

373
00:15:48.418 --> 00:15:51.522
repeating itself and how it's shown up throughout history?

374
00:15:51.522 --> 00:15:53.858
<v ->I kind of have to start with the cults</v>

375
00:15:53.858 --> 00:15:58.455
in and around this area of certainly Lebanon,

376
00:15:58.455 --> 00:16:00.119
Syria, and this area.

377
00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:04.044
And certainly coming out of Egypt at this time period.

378
00:16:04.044 --> 00:16:06.807
At this time period, the Roman government's in trouble.

379
00:16:06.807 --> 00:16:09.302
I mean they're having to deal with people

380
00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:11.297
on all sides of them trying to raid in

381
00:16:11.297 --> 00:16:12.812
and so on and so forth.

382
00:16:12.812 --> 00:16:14.507
And a tremendous amount of stress,

383
00:16:14.507 --> 00:16:16.171
so we're back to stress there.

384
00:16:16.171 --> 00:16:17.697
What you had at that time were a bunch of

385
00:16:17.697 --> 00:16:21.963
small cults that developed in response to this stress.

386
00:16:21.963 --> 00:16:24.704
You had Christ cults, Jesus cults, gnostic cults,

387
00:16:24.704 --> 00:16:27.776
Manicheans, Zorasterterians.

388
00:16:27.776 --> 00:16:29.643
The different Jewish groups that are breaking off

389
00:16:29.643 --> 00:16:31.328
and so on and so forth.

390
00:16:31.328 --> 00:16:34.442
And these were only small groups of people.

391
00:16:34.442 --> 00:16:36.020
And I explain in the book why,

392
00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.481
and you can look at it mathematically

393
00:16:37.481 --> 00:16:40.308
as to what happens to these groups over time.

394
00:16:40.308 --> 00:16:45.308
But at any rate, these people were organizing

395
00:16:45.491 --> 00:16:48.862
around certain ideas, again being a decent person

396
00:16:48.862 --> 00:16:51.666
and so on and so forth.

397
00:16:51.666 --> 00:16:55.058
And what would happen is...

398
00:16:55.058 --> 00:17:00.058
What we have I think is a form of psychiatry in a way

399
00:17:00.658 --> 00:17:04.647
where people are introducing people to this new idea

400
00:17:04.647 --> 00:17:08.486
of human decency through these mind-altering substances.

401
00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:12.326
Now, the priest or someone like Jesus or whatever

402
00:17:12.326 --> 00:17:16.361
who's running these groups, if they don't train people

403
00:17:16.361 --> 00:17:18.601
to take over where they leave off,

404
00:17:18.601 --> 00:17:20.489
the group fissions, it falls apart.

405
00:17:20.489 --> 00:17:21.566
<v Regina>True today.</v>

406
00:17:21.566 --> 00:17:25.768
<v ->Yeah. And what we see in terms of persecution back then</v>

407
00:17:25.768 --> 00:17:29.160
were probably those splinter groups with leaders

408
00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.349
who did not know how to control people on these substances.

409
00:17:32.349 --> 00:17:34.387
I mean these substances were powerful

410
00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:35.954
mind-blowing things, and if you didn't have

411
00:17:35.954 --> 00:17:40.954
a specific ritual where there's a ritual initiation,

412
00:17:41.075 --> 00:17:43.743
content, ritual termination and so on,

413
00:17:43.743 --> 00:17:45.843
if you didn't have all that involved,

414
00:17:45.843 --> 00:17:47.817
these people are out there rolling around in the streets,

415
00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:50.772
probably out smashing idols, seeing demons

416
00:17:50.772 --> 00:17:51.934
and so on and so forth.

417
00:17:51.934 --> 00:17:53.983
These are the people that came to the attention

418
00:17:53.983 --> 00:17:55.486
and who were persecuted.

419
00:17:55.486 --> 00:17:58.365
I don't think as many were persecuted as they'd like to say,

420
00:17:58.365 --> 00:18:02.098
but, certainly a lot of them were.

421
00:18:02.098 --> 00:18:05.490
So, this is the start of these particular groups,

422
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.185
and there's a whole bunch of them.

423
00:18:07.185 --> 00:18:09.745
Now, in terms of personalities, there's absolutely

424
00:18:09.745 --> 00:18:12.284
no historical visibility for Jesus.

425
00:18:12.284 --> 00:18:16.625
There is no historical visibility for Paul,

426
00:18:16.625 --> 00:18:19.388
and they claim he wrote all this stuff.

427
00:18:19.388 --> 00:18:21.500
The face of Paul doesn't show up until

428
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.038
after the face of Jesus shows up.

429
00:18:24.038 --> 00:18:29.038
We don't have a face of Jesus until the late fourth century.

430
00:18:29.246 --> 00:18:32.362
The image of Paul I think shows up about 100 years later.

431
00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:34.335
Why not? Well, the story we're given is,

432
00:18:34.335 --> 00:18:36.136
"Well, we don't want them are worshiping idols,"

433
00:18:36.136 --> 00:18:37.843
idol worship and all that.

434
00:18:37.843 --> 00:18:39.806
Well, they had pictures of bishops,

435
00:18:39.806 --> 00:18:42.942
like Apollinaris and Calictus. Not Calictus.

436
00:18:45.448 --> 00:18:48.349
<v Regina>I have it written down here.</v>

437
00:18:48.349 --> 00:18:49.362
<v ->Forgetting his name right now.</v>

438
00:18:49.362 --> 00:18:50.386
<v Regina>Callixtus?</v>

439
00:18:50.386 --> 00:18:53.106
<v ->Yeah, Callixtus. We've got images of him.</v>

440
00:18:53.106 --> 00:18:55.420
Whether he was a real person or not, I don't know.

441
00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.385
See, the thing is if you can't verify these people,

442
00:18:58.385 --> 00:19:01.062
you can say, "Well, they were all persecuted

443
00:19:01.062 --> 00:19:02.481
"and their heads were cut off," and all this.

444
00:19:02.481 --> 00:19:04.476
You get some wonderful stories that particularly

445
00:19:04.476 --> 00:19:06.161
come out of the middle ages of this.

446
00:19:06.161 --> 00:19:08.593
You can't prove that any of these people really existed.

447
00:19:08.593 --> 00:19:10.671
And here's why.

448
00:19:10.671 --> 00:19:15.310
Who were the people who could read and write back then?

449
00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.548
The priests.

450
00:19:16.548 --> 00:19:17.892
<v Regina>Priests, the elite, yeah.</v>

451
00:19:17.892 --> 00:19:18.788
<v ->And they wrote their story.</v>

452
00:19:18.788 --> 00:19:20.089
We've got about 1,000 years of

453
00:19:20.089 --> 00:19:24.408
Catholic history that cannot be verified.

454
00:19:24.408 --> 00:19:28.355
Because nobody could criticize it, they couldn't read.

455
00:19:28.355 --> 00:19:29.101
<v Regina>They couldn't read it.</v>

456
00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:30.424
<v ->So, they couldn't criticize it.</v>

457
00:19:30.424 --> 00:19:34.434
And so, up until probably the 14th century,

458
00:19:34.434 --> 00:19:38.476
from the third century up to the 14th century,

459
00:19:38.476 --> 00:19:41.474
you've got a history which cannot be verified.

460
00:19:41.474 --> 00:19:43.223
<v Regina>And which would, one would have to</v>

461
00:19:43.223 --> 00:19:45.111
think be self-serving by nature.

462
00:19:45.111 --> 00:19:48.588
<v ->Oh, absolutely. History does not happen;</v>

463
00:19:48.588 --> 00:19:51.733
it's constructed in all cases by people.

464
00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:53.258
And they're all biased.

465
00:19:53.258 --> 00:19:57.024
<v Regina>Okay, let's take it from that perspective.</v>

466
00:19:57.024 --> 00:19:59.039
When you're looking at self-interest at the time,

467
00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:00.713
and I know you would have to break it down

468
00:20:00.713 --> 00:20:03.433
almost in blocks of history.

469
00:20:03.433 --> 00:20:07.454
What would the interest be in creating a personification

470
00:20:07.454 --> 00:20:09.545
of a being called "Jesus"?

471
00:20:09.545 --> 00:20:11.497
<v ->We have to make him real.</v>

472
00:20:11.497 --> 00:20:15.037
Maybe this is sort of a connection to the Greeks,

473
00:20:15.037 --> 00:20:18.547
if you will, you know, the skeptics.

474
00:20:18.547 --> 00:20:21.533
Maybe the science of the day and so on and so forth,

475
00:20:21.533 --> 00:20:23.166
but, Jesus had to be a real person.

476
00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:25.277
If they came out and said, "Jesus was a mushroom,"

477
00:20:25.277 --> 00:20:27.111
who's going to go for that?

478
00:20:27.111 --> 00:20:28.999
So, he's got to be a real person

479
00:20:28.999 --> 00:20:31.356
that people can identify with.

480
00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:32.972
And so, that's why they have to construct him

481
00:20:32.972 --> 00:20:35.788
into history, forge him into history.

482
00:20:35.788 --> 00:20:39.424
He couldn't just be a non-person.

483
00:20:39.424 --> 00:20:42.591
This is where the Trinity comes in.

484
00:20:42.591 --> 00:20:44.757
There are groups of people thought Jesus was

485
00:20:44.757 --> 00:20:47.338
only an experience that you had,

486
00:20:47.338 --> 00:20:50.026
and you pick up on this in the Gnostic Gospels,

487
00:20:50.026 --> 00:20:51.849
Gospel of Thomas, where they say,

488
00:20:51.849 --> 00:20:53.641
"When will we see you?"

489
00:20:53.641 --> 00:20:54.921
In other words, they're having an experience,

490
00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:56.307
they're hearing a voice.

491
00:20:56.307 --> 00:20:58.260
Or the sense of presence next to them,

492
00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:03.260
which is very common with the mushroom experience.

493
00:21:03.525 --> 00:21:06.677
So, you don't get in these things that

494
00:21:06.677 --> 00:21:09.119
anybody's really seeing him in some of these groups.

495
00:21:09.119 --> 00:21:10.771
They're experiencing him.

496
00:21:10.771 --> 00:21:12.499
And then, there's the groups that probably

497
00:21:12.499 --> 00:21:16.403
are the splinter groups who weren't the upper...

498
00:21:16.403 --> 00:21:18.451
You know, the priests and whatever were taken the mushrooms,

499
00:21:18.451 --> 00:21:20.531
but, the congregation were not,

500
00:21:20.531 --> 00:21:22.013
and they were told that he was a real person.

501
00:21:22.013 --> 00:21:22.952
So, then, you've got these groups

502
00:21:22.952 --> 00:21:24.552
that think he was a real person.

503
00:21:24.552 --> 00:21:25.778
And then, you got the other group

504
00:21:25.778 --> 00:21:29.093
that thinks he's a little bit of each. That's the Trinity.

505
00:21:29.093 --> 00:21:32.323
You know, this idea of something that's there,

506
00:21:32.323 --> 00:21:33.379
something that's not there,

507
00:21:33.379 --> 00:21:35.256
and something that ties them together,

508
00:21:35.256 --> 00:21:36.184
so that's the Trinity.

509
00:21:36.184 --> 00:21:41.048
And this is how they got around and absorbed these groups.

510
00:21:41.048 --> 00:21:42.572
One way to absorb them would be

511
00:21:42.572 --> 00:21:44.397
to pay attention to their best, tell them,

512
00:21:44.397 --> 00:21:46.818
"Okay, we'll build a story that incorporates it all,"

513
00:21:46.818 --> 00:21:47.586
and that's the Trinity.

514
00:21:47.586 --> 00:21:50.887
That came out in the Council of Nicaea.

515
00:21:50.887 --> 00:21:53.874
325 of the current era.

516
00:21:53.874 --> 00:21:56.252
<v Regina>And so, now they're starting to</v>

517
00:21:56.252 --> 00:21:58.631
gather in the splinter groups.

518
00:21:58.631 --> 00:21:59.847
<v ->Well, they're trying to.</v>

519
00:21:59.847 --> 00:22:01.456
Whatever they couldn't gather in,

520
00:22:01.456 --> 00:22:03.505
they went out and got rid of.

521
00:22:03.505 --> 00:22:06.245
You hear the stories about burning literature,

522
00:22:06.245 --> 00:22:09.967
I think probably most of it's in the Vatican.

523
00:22:09.967 --> 00:22:13.423
You know, a lot of these priests were pretty brutal,

524
00:22:13.423 --> 00:22:15.311
but, they weren't stupid.

525
00:22:15.311 --> 00:22:18.032
And they admired history and so on.

526
00:22:18.032 --> 00:22:19.760
so, they probably collected up a lot of these books.

527
00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.787
That's why we have the Gnostic Gospels,

528
00:22:21.787 --> 00:22:23.376
because they were buried in the desert

529
00:22:23.376 --> 00:22:26.608
and they weren't found until 1945 by a gentleman

530
00:22:26.608 --> 00:22:29.349
by the name of Mohammed Ali. He finds them.

531
00:22:29.349 --> 00:22:34.349
And then, once they're out there, much of it is lost.

532
00:22:34.929 --> 00:22:39.313
We only have 52 books out of the numbers that he found,

533
00:22:39.313 --> 00:22:41.478
and where the rest of it went, we don't really know.

534
00:22:41.478 --> 00:22:44.741
But, these splinter groups, those that would not

535
00:22:44.741 --> 00:22:47.825
come on board and join the club,

536
00:22:47.825 --> 00:22:50.576
they were probably destroyed.

537
00:22:50.576 --> 00:22:52.934
<v Regina>And as it is today,</v>

538
00:22:52.934 --> 00:22:56.101
it's not in the church's best interest,

539
00:22:56.101 --> 00:22:59.024
either economically or for matters of control

540
00:22:59.024 --> 00:23:02.522
to have people thinking independently,

541
00:23:02.522 --> 00:23:05.263
having their own direct experiences with God.

542
00:23:05.263 --> 00:23:08.101
You can't raise capital, and you can't maintain

543
00:23:08.101 --> 00:23:10.575
power over people, certainly if the people

544
00:23:10.575 --> 00:23:14.010
are to have their own directive experience, so...

545
00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:16.260
<v ->It can only be one celestial truth.</v>

546
00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:16.729
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

547
00:23:16.729 --> 00:23:18.233
<v ->And if people are having these experiences,</v>

548
00:23:18.233 --> 00:23:19.695
then they've got other celestial truth.

549
00:23:19.695 --> 00:23:21.145
They have to stop all that.

550
00:23:21.145 --> 00:23:22.926
So, the average person is told,

551
00:23:22.926 --> 00:23:25.614
"Well, you just have to believe this on faith.

552
00:23:25.614 --> 00:23:28.153
"And to have faith that it happened."

553
00:23:28.153 --> 00:23:30.905
Well, okay. I mean that's one way of doing it I suppose.

554
00:23:30.905 --> 00:23:33.068
But, you're right. I mean there's a vested interest here

555
00:23:33.068 --> 00:23:34.817
in maintaining all this.

556
00:23:34.817 --> 00:23:36.481
<v Regina>And keeping control of the people at the time.</v>

557
00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:38.795
<v ->Right. And so, you threaten them.</v>

558
00:23:38.795 --> 00:23:40.246
What you threaten them with today?

559
00:23:40.246 --> 00:23:41.984
Well, celestial punishment.

560
00:23:41.984 --> 00:23:42.923
<v Regina>Well, hellfire and damnation.</v>

561
00:23:42.923 --> 00:23:44.715
Yeah, punishment, absolutely.

562
00:23:44.715 --> 00:23:46.784
<v ->It's rejection in its highest form.</v>

563
00:23:46.784 --> 00:23:50.688
<v Regina>Which as you say in those a very early cults,</v>

564
00:23:50.688 --> 00:23:53.888
and I say "cult," I don't mean it in any kind of dark way,

565
00:23:53.888 --> 00:23:56.383
just a gathering of people who have a different agenda

566
00:23:56.383 --> 00:23:59.766
that's broken off from the norm.

567
00:23:59.766 --> 00:24:03.689
That these principles of love, brotherly love,

568
00:24:03.689 --> 00:24:05.961
and right down to hygiene and such were

569
00:24:05.961 --> 00:24:07.870
really very practical and very personal.

570
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.704
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

571
00:24:09.704 --> 00:24:11.464
<v Regina>And it certainly was no mechanism</v>

572
00:24:11.464 --> 00:24:12.585
for control of the people.

573
00:24:12.585 --> 00:24:14.717
<v ->Right. The basic mechanism for</v>

574
00:24:14.717 --> 00:24:17.788
controlling people is morality, which comes out of

575
00:24:17.788 --> 00:24:21.265
social necessity, not these religious traditions.

576
00:24:21.265 --> 00:24:22.353
<v Regina>Right.</v>

577
00:24:22.353 --> 00:24:24.145
<v ->I need to define religion for you here,</v>

578
00:24:24.145 --> 00:24:26.833
so that the viewer can understand

579
00:24:26.833 --> 00:24:28.678
what we're talking about.

580
00:24:28.678 --> 00:24:30.587
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam,

581
00:24:30.587 --> 00:24:33.787
in my interpretation of this are not religions.

582
00:24:33.787 --> 00:24:36.709
They are political systems.

583
00:24:36.709 --> 00:24:39.887
The original definition of religion had to do with

584
00:24:39.887 --> 00:24:42.000
one person's piety towards

585
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.548
a super-ordinate agencies, that's it.

586
00:24:44.548 --> 00:24:46.852
When these people start telling you where to pray,

587
00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:48.793
how to pray, what to eat, what to wear,

588
00:24:48.793 --> 00:24:50.542
who to hang out with, what to read,

589
00:24:50.542 --> 00:24:53.977
and who to vote for, is that religion?

590
00:24:53.977 --> 00:24:54.937
<v Regina>No, it's politics.</v>

591
00:24:54.937 --> 00:24:59.188
<v ->It's politics, and that's exactly what these groups do.</v>

592
00:24:59.188 --> 00:24:59.818
Now, you might say,

593
00:24:59.818 --> 00:25:01.950
"Buddhism, how does that fit into this?"

594
00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.019
Well, someone who gets into Buddhism,

595
00:25:04.019 --> 00:25:05.384
and the more they get into it,

596
00:25:05.384 --> 00:25:07.880
the more they lose themselves.

597
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.981
Same with Hinduism, same thing.

598
00:25:09.981 --> 00:25:12.605
And so, they sort of control you as well.

599
00:25:12.605 --> 00:25:13.970
I mean there's lots of nice things in there,

600
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:15.996
just like there's lots of nice things and Christianity.

601
00:25:15.996 --> 00:25:17.543
But, when you look at the bigger picture,

602
00:25:17.543 --> 00:25:19.964
it's not religion, it's a political system.

603
00:25:19.964 --> 00:25:23.089
<v Regina>Right. And so, now we have</v>

604
00:25:23.089 --> 00:25:26.321
the mushrooming of the Catholic Church,

605
00:25:26.321 --> 00:25:28.873
(both laugh)
as it were.

606
00:25:28.873 --> 00:25:32.062
And as the church gains more power and the others

607
00:25:32.062 --> 00:25:34.931
are really either destroyed, set aside, or...

608
00:25:34.931 --> 00:25:35.923
<v ->Demonized.</v>

609
00:25:35.923 --> 00:25:37.811
<v Regina>Demonized or brought into the church.</v>

610
00:25:37.811 --> 00:25:40.563
It obviously became clear then that if

611
00:25:40.563 --> 00:25:43.751
the sacred use of mushrooms, for example,

612
00:25:43.751 --> 00:25:46.652
mind-altering substances was to be used

613
00:25:46.652 --> 00:25:49.436
and it was to be preserved in that tradition

614
00:25:49.436 --> 00:25:51.185
historically and throughout the artwork,

615
00:25:51.185 --> 00:25:52.817
that it would have to be hidden.

616
00:25:52.817 --> 00:25:55.420
And now, this is where some interpretation

617
00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:59.836
comes into some of the (clears throat) plates that you have.

618
00:25:59.836 --> 00:26:01.723
And it's a beautiful disk in the back of the book that shows

619
00:26:01.723 --> 00:26:05.702
242 images of mushrooms in art throughout Europe.

620
00:26:05.702 --> 00:26:10.702
And I assume that's what happened at that time,

621
00:26:10.839 --> 00:26:13.090
and that's where the direct experience

622
00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.358
had to start going underground?

623
00:26:14.358 --> 00:26:17.591
<v ->Yeah, they had to maintain the image</v>

624
00:26:17.591 --> 00:26:22.080
of the mushroom in the art in some way.

625
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.502
The reason for this is if you eliminate the symbol,

626
00:26:24.502 --> 00:26:29.096
or you change the symbol, it loses its power.

627
00:26:29.096 --> 00:26:31.229
<v Regina>And it loses its historical accuracy,</v>

628
00:26:31.229 --> 00:26:32.691
if that's what was intended.

629
00:26:32.691 --> 00:26:34.025
<v ->Well, if that's what was intended.</v>

630
00:26:34.025 --> 00:26:38.505
I think the intent here is to indicate that

631
00:26:38.505 --> 00:26:43.475
the initial message that led the person

632
00:26:43.475 --> 00:26:45.587
to do the art came from God.

633
00:26:45.587 --> 00:26:47.986
And so, the mushroom then becomes

634
00:26:47.986 --> 00:26:50.141
the signature of God.

635
00:26:50.141 --> 00:26:55.141
(stammers) When you start looking at it that way,

636
00:26:57.031 --> 00:27:00.221
it is a way to preserve the old time religion

637
00:27:00.221 --> 00:27:01.906
that's connected to it, and that's the use

638
00:27:01.906 --> 00:27:03.249
of these substances.

639
00:27:03.249 --> 00:27:05.692
And the artists have done a marvelous job in doing this.

640
00:27:05.692 --> 00:27:07.622
<v Regina>Well, this has gone on in the research.</v>

641
00:27:07.622 --> 00:27:11.325
it went on over about 13, 14 centuries anyway?

642
00:27:11.325 --> 00:27:12.199
<v ->Mm-hmm.</v>

643
00:27:12.199 --> 00:27:14.588
<v ->And it was perpetuated not just out of Rome,</v>

644
00:27:14.588 --> 00:27:18.236
but, throughout Europe into the Celtic regions,

645
00:27:18.236 --> 00:27:19.985
the mushroom keeps popping up all over the place.

646
00:27:19.985 --> 00:27:22.140
<v ->Right, because it's a standard motif,</v>

647
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:26.993
it is part of the commissioned art,

648
00:27:26.993 --> 00:27:28.603
the way it was to be presented,

649
00:27:28.603 --> 00:27:33.603
and there's standard themes that we see;

650
00:27:33.743 --> 00:27:37.295
The birth of Jesus, we see mother Mary nursing Jesus.

651
00:27:37.295 --> 00:27:41.423
We see Jesus who is now getting older

652
00:27:41.423 --> 00:27:43.759
and he drops away from mother Mary

653
00:27:43.759 --> 00:27:45.711
and hooks onto Mary Magdalene.

654
00:27:45.711 --> 00:27:48.921
That makes them more human, manly, if you will.

655
00:27:48.921 --> 00:27:51.161
And then mother Mary comes back into the...

656
00:27:51.161 --> 00:27:54.466
The other thing that I found, which really connects

657
00:27:54.466 --> 00:27:59.309
a lot of this together, is that the Christians

658
00:27:59.309 --> 00:28:02.359
were seen as a weird bunch of people,

659
00:28:02.359 --> 00:28:04.237
doing something very strange.

660
00:28:04.237 --> 00:28:06.476
Now, when we look at the pagan cults, my gosh,

661
00:28:06.476 --> 00:28:07.372
they're doing everything.

662
00:28:07.372 --> 00:28:09.964
They have orgies to worship the deities,

663
00:28:09.964 --> 00:28:12.179
they're using substances to worship the deities,

664
00:28:12.179 --> 00:28:14.899
they're praying, begging, doing whatever.

665
00:28:14.899 --> 00:28:18.803
And what were they seeing in the Christians that was so odd?

666
00:28:18.803 --> 00:28:21.064
Well, what they were seeing was this:

667
00:28:21.064 --> 00:28:25.202
(clears throat) They would seek out the mushroom,

668
00:28:25.202 --> 00:28:27.378
they're going to seek out the teacher of righteousness,

669
00:28:27.378 --> 00:28:29.960
so, they've got to go to the sacred grove to find it.

670
00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.378
They have to have a ritual before they

671
00:28:31.378 --> 00:28:34.002
pull the mushroom out of the ground.

672
00:28:34.002 --> 00:28:35.772
You've got to dry it, you got to keep it away

673
00:28:35.772 --> 00:28:38.919
from slugs and flies and that type of thing.

674
00:28:38.919 --> 00:28:42.887
And then, you have to dry it, and then,

675
00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:45.084
there's a ritual for consuming it.

676
00:28:45.084 --> 00:28:48.881
Now, I may be wrong here, but, my interpretation is

677
00:28:48.881 --> 00:28:51.963
that this represents the stations of the cross

678
00:28:51.963 --> 00:28:53.670
in modern times.

679
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:56.313
It's an elaboration of it, certainly.

680
00:28:56.313 --> 00:28:59.426
But, it represents finding, locating.

681
00:28:59.426 --> 00:29:02.624
Pontius Pilate, "Are you God," he says to him.

682
00:29:02.624 --> 00:29:05.878
And Jesus says, "If you say so," and that condemns him.

683
00:29:05.878 --> 00:29:08.907
He didn't really say he was, if you will.

684
00:29:08.907 --> 00:29:11.157
And so, this, to me is a representation,

685
00:29:11.157 --> 00:29:16.157
and we see this in other cultures, of locating,

686
00:29:16.222 --> 00:29:21.222
harvesting, drying, and then consuming the mushroom.

687
00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:23.440
<v Regina>(stammers) It is fascinating,</v>

688
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.202
it doesn't take much to turn your vision that way

689
00:29:26.202 --> 00:29:28.783
when you started seeing the imagery in front of you.

690
00:29:28.783 --> 00:29:30.532
And what was interesting is this was

691
00:29:30.532 --> 00:29:33.476
not reflected in secular artwork.

692
00:29:33.476 --> 00:29:36.644
<v ->No, not at all. You do not see these images</v>

693
00:29:36.644 --> 00:29:37.892
in the secular art.

694
00:29:37.892 --> 00:29:39.630
They're just not there until recent times

695
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:41.764
when the church kind of lost control of the art.

696
00:29:41.764 --> 00:29:43.918
And then, you start to see it popping up.

697
00:29:43.918 --> 00:29:45.305
Now you see it all over the place, you know,

698
00:29:45.305 --> 00:29:49.145
Mario Brothers and their computer games,

699
00:29:49.145 --> 00:29:51.640
Walt Disney, I mean all this type of thing.

700
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.320
But, until that time, the church controlled the art

701
00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.659
and you do not see it in the secular, it's not there.

702
00:29:58.659 --> 00:30:01.197
<v Regina>No fungi.</v>
<v ->No fungi.</v>

703
00:30:01.197 --> 00:30:03.352
<v Regina>And one thing I heard your lecture on</v>

704
00:30:03.352 --> 00:30:06.562
which I thought was fascinating in kind of a contemporary,

705
00:30:06.562 --> 00:30:08.439
a little more contemporary spin on it

706
00:30:08.439 --> 00:30:11.883
was the notion of Father Christmas.

707
00:30:11.883 --> 00:30:13.163
<v ->Christmas, yes.</v>

708
00:30:13.163 --> 00:30:15.189
<v Regina>(laughs) And the mushroom.</v>

709
00:30:15.189 --> 00:30:16.917
And it's true, you do when you see these little

710
00:30:16.917 --> 00:30:20.288
European fairy tale books where Father Christmas appears,

711
00:30:20.288 --> 00:30:22.240
you do see mushrooms, that's rather common.

712
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.330
<v ->Yeah, the mushrooms are there.</v>

713
00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:25.407
<v Regina>I thought it was just because maybe</v>

714
00:30:25.407 --> 00:30:26.708
it was something, you know, set in Bavaria

715
00:30:26.708 --> 00:30:28.404
and there are a lot of mushrooms in the woods.

716
00:30:28.404 --> 00:30:30.740
<v ->It's starting to come out now who Santa Claus was.</v>

717
00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:31.508
(clears throat)

718
00:30:31.508 --> 00:30:32.692
<v Regina>Let's talk about, let's go to</v>

719
00:30:32.692 --> 00:30:34.985
really sacred territory; Santa Claus.

720
00:30:34.985 --> 00:30:37.949
<v ->Santa Claus. Santa Claus is a shaman.</v>

721
00:30:37.949 --> 00:30:39.751
And the way he's dressed in the red suit,

722
00:30:39.751 --> 00:30:44.751
of course this is a late 19th century image really.

723
00:30:45.212 --> 00:30:48.529
But, the shamans dressed in red suits.

724
00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:51.888
They were the red deer, if you will, they are wearing.

725
00:30:51.888 --> 00:30:53.552
They would wear these composites,

726
00:30:53.552 --> 00:30:57.082
oftentimes with the antlers and so on and so forth.

727
00:30:57.082 --> 00:30:58.618
Now, the story is this, now I don't know if

728
00:30:58.618 --> 00:31:01.156
this story is true or not, so we'll have to (clears throat)

729
00:31:01.156 --> 00:31:04.484
throw it up in the air and let people look at it.

730
00:31:04.484 --> 00:31:06.606
What the shamans would do in Europe,

731
00:31:06.606 --> 00:31:10.201
and this would be connected to Celtic times,

732
00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:15.140
more Saxon times really, Thor and all that.

733
00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.806
The shaman would go out in late fall,

734
00:31:17.806 --> 00:31:22.806
collect the mushrooms, and then in the winter solstice,

735
00:31:23.118 --> 00:31:24.398
he would go to the houses.

736
00:31:24.398 --> 00:31:25.870
And of course, they're all snowed in,

737
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:28.227
and so they all had openings in the roofs

738
00:31:28.227 --> 00:31:30.510
so they could get out of the houses during the winter.

739
00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.523
And so, he would go down there

740
00:31:31.523 --> 00:31:33.517
and he would hand out the mushrooms.

741
00:31:33.517 --> 00:31:35.491
Now, (clears throat) the mushroom itself

742
00:31:35.491 --> 00:31:40.491
grows synergistically on the roots of pine trees.

743
00:31:42.914 --> 00:31:46.145
And so, what's the connection to the pine tree?

744
00:31:46.145 --> 00:31:47.756
Well, you bring the pine tree into the house

745
00:31:47.756 --> 00:31:49.121
to get the gift under the tree.

746
00:31:49.121 --> 00:31:50.785
What's the gift? The mushroom.

747
00:31:50.785 --> 00:31:53.141
And of course it becomes elaborated and economic

748
00:31:53.141 --> 00:31:55.029
and so on these days, and so,

749
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:56.511
we get all these other types of gifts.

750
00:31:56.511 --> 00:31:59.764
But, the original gift under the tree was the mushroom.

751
00:31:59.764 --> 00:32:01.438
We can also see the different stages

752
00:32:01.438 --> 00:32:03.060
of the mushroom as it's growing.

753
00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.916
One of the first stages as it comes out of the ground,

754
00:32:04.916 --> 00:32:06.719
it looks like an egg. (clears throat)

755
00:32:06.719 --> 00:32:07.679
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

756
00:32:07.679 --> 00:32:08.831
<v ->You think that's connected to Easter,</v>

757
00:32:08.831 --> 00:32:11.834
and the Easter egg hunt?

758
00:32:11.834 --> 00:32:14.447
Easter is actually "Äostre,"

759
00:32:14.447 --> 00:32:17.540
was a Saxon goddess of fertility,

760
00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.981
and her symbol was the rabbit.

761
00:32:19.981 --> 00:32:22.253
And they did all kinds of things there.

762
00:32:22.253 --> 00:32:25.933
And that gets over into the sort of pagan ideas,

763
00:32:25.933 --> 00:32:29.400
but, Santa is a pagan deity that comes into Christmas,

764
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:33.367
or into the Christian tradition. Why is that?

765
00:32:33.367 --> 00:32:36.091
Well, the church was very good at

766
00:32:36.091 --> 00:32:38.289
absorbing these other traditions,

767
00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:40.890
and not destroying them right away.

768
00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:44.527
They tried to get rid of Christmas.

769
00:32:44.527 --> 00:32:48.815
They've tried to get rid of Halloween.

770
00:32:48.815 --> 00:32:53.764
Samhain, which is the Celtic All Hallows Eve,

771
00:32:53.764 --> 00:32:56.132
which "Halloween" stands for.

772
00:32:56.132 --> 00:32:57.390
They tried to get rid of that putting

773
00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:00.889
All Saints Day right next to it, which is November 1.

774
00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:02.979
They tried to do the same thing in Mexico

775
00:33:02.979 --> 00:33:05.038
with their Day of the Dead and whatnot.

776
00:33:05.038 --> 00:33:07.702
What happened to All Saints Day?

777
00:33:07.702 --> 00:33:11.063
I mean certainly in the Catholic Church, they recognize it,

778
00:33:11.063 --> 00:33:13.153
but, Halloween is still there because

779
00:33:13.153 --> 00:33:16.140
it speaks to something deep within us.

780
00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:18.230
And that is death.

781
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:19.905
I mean it's something we've been fascinated with,

782
00:33:19.905 --> 00:33:24.480
tried to understand demons and ancestors

783
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.627
and so on and so forth, and so, they can't get rid of it.

784
00:33:27.627 --> 00:33:31.733
Christmas, by absorbing that,

785
00:33:31.733 --> 00:33:34.154
they figured it would just fall apart over time,

786
00:33:34.154 --> 00:33:36.169
but, it never did.

787
00:33:36.169 --> 00:33:37.876
If you drive around and look at

788
00:33:37.876 --> 00:33:40.318
the different denominations,

789
00:33:40.318 --> 00:33:42.964
particularly the Fundamentalists,

790
00:33:42.964 --> 00:33:46.270
they don't call it "Halloween,"

791
00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:47.934
they call it "Harvest Day," you see.

792
00:33:47.934 --> 00:33:50.814
So, that's their way of trying to eliminate this

793
00:33:50.814 --> 00:33:53.267
from the Christian tradition.

794
00:33:53.267 --> 00:33:54.999
And also, in many of these churches,

795
00:33:54.999 --> 00:33:57.334
you don't even talk about Santa anymore,

796
00:33:57.334 --> 00:33:59.284
I mean because it is a pagan holiday.

797
00:33:59.284 --> 00:34:01.490
<v Regina>Right, right, and that</v>

798
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:03.847
has been brought to their attention.

799
00:34:03.847 --> 00:34:05.767
My son went to the Waldorf school.

800
00:34:05.767 --> 00:34:08.796
And quite a few of the parents who had not really looked

801
00:34:08.796 --> 00:34:13.511
into the nature of Rudolph Steiner's work

802
00:34:13.511 --> 00:34:16.252
were surprised along the way with certain of the holidays,

803
00:34:16.252 --> 00:34:19.196
including the harvest Festival, including May Day.

804
00:34:19.196 --> 00:34:21.126
May Day is highly celebrated.

805
00:34:21.126 --> 00:34:24.966
Beltane, essentially, a pagan holiday from Celtic times.

806
00:34:24.966 --> 00:34:27.611
<v ->You know what they used to do in Beltane?</v>

807
00:34:27.611 --> 00:34:32.111
You ready for this? They plowed the fields,

808
00:34:32.111 --> 00:34:34.874
and they're getting ready to plant the fields.

809
00:34:34.874 --> 00:34:36.657
They would build these little structures

810
00:34:36.657 --> 00:34:39.035
and then go out and collect cannabis

811
00:34:39.035 --> 00:34:41.350
which grew all over the place, and they would burn it

812
00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:43.131
in braziers in these little huts and they would

813
00:34:43.131 --> 00:34:45.168
climb in there and get pretty stoned,

814
00:34:45.168 --> 00:34:47.163
and then, go out and copulate in the fields.

815
00:34:47.163 --> 00:34:47.963
<v Regina>Yes.</v>
<v ->That's May Day.</v>

816
00:34:47.963 --> 00:34:49.051
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

817
00:34:49.051 --> 00:34:51.206
<v ->Now, that sounds pretty good to me.</v>

818
00:34:51.206 --> 00:34:52.688
<v Regina>I was aware of that, yes.</v>

819
00:34:52.688 --> 00:34:54.160
And the weather had warmed up,

820
00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.623
took the chill off a little bit.

821
00:34:55.623 --> 00:34:58.865
<v ->Yeah, yeah. So, you can see in the background,</v>

822
00:34:58.865 --> 00:35:01.788
a lot of these pagan traditions and (clears throat),

823
00:35:01.788 --> 00:35:04.818
as Campbell said, these things transform through time.

824
00:35:04.818 --> 00:35:05.671
<v Regina>Right.</v>

825
00:35:05.671 --> 00:35:08.135
<v ->And so, a lot of the bits and pieces have been lost.</v>

826
00:35:08.135 --> 00:35:11.391
Like "Hot Cross Buns," for example.

827
00:35:11.391 --> 00:35:16.391
This comes from the Saxon ox, the word for "ox" is "bund,"

828
00:35:20.723 --> 00:35:23.454
and during that May Day celebration,

829
00:35:23.454 --> 00:35:25.086
they would sacrifice an ox, and then they would

830
00:35:25.086 --> 00:35:27.784
make these little loaves of bread

831
00:35:27.784 --> 00:35:30.920
that were scored with the likeness of the ox.

832
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.319
These are our Hot Cross Buns today,

833
00:35:33.319 --> 00:35:34.909
so, (clears throat) people don't see

834
00:35:34.909 --> 00:35:36.050
the connection way back there,

835
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.468
because no one ever really talks about it anymore.

836
00:35:37.468 --> 00:35:39.922
But, if you dig in deep, you know,

837
00:35:39.922 --> 00:35:41.405
read people like Carl Ruck and whatever,

838
00:35:41.405 --> 00:35:44.274
you get the point of many of these things.

839
00:35:44.274 --> 00:35:46.791
<v Regina>But, would you say that the ones</v>

840
00:35:46.791 --> 00:35:49.073
that have persisted throughout time

841
00:35:49.073 --> 00:35:50.940
is because it's speaking to something

842
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:51.953
deeper in our psyche?

843
00:35:51.953 --> 00:35:52.732
<v ->Yes.</v>

844
00:35:52.732 --> 00:35:54.150
<v Regina>In most all cases?</v>
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

845
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:55.718
<v Regina>And in that sense, like you say,</v>

846
00:35:55.718 --> 00:35:58.172
it's not so much whether Jesus was

847
00:35:58.172 --> 00:36:01.222
a flesh and blood human, but, more what he is

848
00:36:01.222 --> 00:36:02.436
credited with having said.

849
00:36:02.436 --> 00:36:03.204
<v ->Right.</v>

850
00:36:03.204 --> 00:36:05.540
<v Regina>And I don't know if I'm misinterpreting</v>

851
00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:09.102
this in your book, but, as you were saying, as people take

852
00:36:09.102 --> 00:36:14.102
psilocybin or the, is it amanita muscaria is the name?

853
00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.073
<v ->Yeah, amanita muscaria.</v>

854
00:36:16.073 --> 00:36:19.027
<v Regina>And that particular mushroom, for example.</v>

855
00:36:19.027 --> 00:36:24.027
And have these the mind expanded types of experiences,

856
00:36:26.686 --> 00:36:28.776
they're meeting with what could be considered

857
00:36:28.776 --> 00:36:31.037
the Christ consciousness on the other side.

858
00:36:31.037 --> 00:36:33.448
<v ->Right, that other part of us.</v>

859
00:36:33.448 --> 00:36:34.152
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

860
00:36:34.152 --> 00:36:36.658
<v ->And (clears throat), that we say, first of all</v>

861
00:36:36.658 --> 00:36:38.685
that these substances are dangerous.

862
00:36:38.685 --> 00:36:39.826
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

863
00:36:39.826 --> 00:36:43.602
<v ->They're not to be true lightly.</v>

864
00:36:43.602 --> 00:36:46.354
Mescaline, for example, which is not European,

865
00:36:46.354 --> 00:36:49.436
it's a North American and Middle American

866
00:36:49.436 --> 00:36:53.436
and South American substance; that's a 12 hour trip.

867
00:36:53.436 --> 00:36:56.049
And if you're not in some sort of a ritual

868
00:36:56.049 --> 00:36:58.236
that goes along with it, I mean you don't know

869
00:36:58.236 --> 00:37:01.277
if you're a sleep, awake, what's happening,

870
00:37:01.277 --> 00:37:03.368
and people can go insane on this stuff.

871
00:37:03.368 --> 00:37:05.863
So, I don't want to, you know,

872
00:37:05.863 --> 00:37:07.410
the audience to think that you should

873
00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:08.733
go out and jump into this stuff.

874
00:37:08.733 --> 00:37:10.332
<v Regina>Yes, it's not casual drug use, absolutely.</v>

875
00:37:10.332 --> 00:37:11.986
<v ->No, it is not, it is not casual at all,</v>

876
00:37:11.986 --> 00:37:13.714
because you'll get in trouble with it.

877
00:37:13.714 --> 00:37:15.868
Well, look how people get an trouble with alcohol.

878
00:37:15.868 --> 00:37:19.057
Which should not be a casual substance as well,

879
00:37:19.057 --> 00:37:20.828
but, we've taken it out of the ritual context

880
00:37:20.828 --> 00:37:22.556
and people get in trouble with it.

881
00:37:22.556 --> 00:37:26.362
So, and original context, these can be very, very powerful

882
00:37:26.362 --> 00:37:31.135
and the mind-opening to whatever that other side of us is.

883
00:37:31.135 --> 00:37:33.119
And this is why these people took them

884
00:37:33.119 --> 00:37:35.317
and continue to take them.

885
00:37:35.317 --> 00:37:37.877
<v Regina>And to whatever else lies beyond that veil</v>

886
00:37:37.877 --> 00:37:39.828
once you pierce through in your own consciousness

887
00:37:39.828 --> 00:37:41.955
and whatever else might be lying just beyond that,

888
00:37:41.955 --> 00:37:44.798
by way of multi-dimensionality,

889
00:37:44.798 --> 00:37:47.091
one would have to assume there's all kinds of consciousness,

890
00:37:47.091 --> 00:37:48.659
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

891
00:37:48.659 --> 00:37:49.960
<v Regina>And all the different dimensions</v>

892
00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.240
surrounding us all the time.

893
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.280
<v ->Absolutely, the mind is an interesting organ</v>

894
00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.589
which we don't understand.

895
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:58.589
<v Regina>Yes. And in the end, this book is saying that</v>

896
00:38:01.802 --> 00:38:04.852
when you say Jesus was a mushroom,

897
00:38:04.852 --> 00:38:08.319
Jesus was an experience that people were

898
00:38:08.319 --> 00:38:10.825
taken through to as a result of

899
00:38:10.825 --> 00:38:13.641
ingesting these sacred substances.

900
00:38:13.641 --> 00:38:14.228
<v ->Correct.</v>

901
00:38:14.228 --> 00:38:18.332
<v Regina>And that wisdom and the beauty of that knowledge</v>

902
00:38:18.332 --> 00:38:22.193
wherever that came from, whether it's literally an entity

903
00:38:22.193 --> 00:38:24.028
in some other dimension or whether it's

904
00:38:24.028 --> 00:38:28.252
an aspect of self is the beauty of that experience

905
00:38:28.252 --> 00:38:31.781
that has been largely set aside for politics?

906
00:38:31.781 --> 00:38:32.710
Is that fair to say?

907
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.761
<v ->Yeah, what's interesting here is during the 60's,</v>

908
00:38:35.761 --> 00:38:37.104
of course the government came down

909
00:38:37.104 --> 00:38:39.419
really hard on people consuming cannabis

910
00:38:39.419 --> 00:38:41.392
and all these other substances.

911
00:38:41.392 --> 00:38:43.056
Because they were afraid that these people

912
00:38:43.056 --> 00:38:45.317
would have an experience that would lead people

913
00:38:45.317 --> 00:38:47.568
to overturn the government.

914
00:38:47.568 --> 00:38:49.744
But, who's running the government right now?

915
00:38:49.744 --> 00:38:51.184
Those people that were having these experiences

916
00:38:51.184 --> 00:38:53.690
back in the 60's and 70's,

917
00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:54.874
which is kind of interesting.

918
00:38:54.874 --> 00:38:56.954
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

919
00:38:56.954 --> 00:39:00.548
<v ->There's all kinds of ways of looking at this.</v>

920
00:39:00.548 --> 00:39:05.548
Let me make mention of the parables in the New Testament,

921
00:39:05.828 --> 00:39:09.630
and that you find in the Gnostic Gospels.

922
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:13.097
The purpose of the parables really was to see if someone

923
00:39:13.097 --> 00:39:17.715
was worthy or smart enough to have communion with God.

924
00:39:17.715 --> 00:39:19.528
Because not everyone was welcome.

925
00:39:19.528 --> 00:39:21.768
I mean you read in the New Testament of

926
00:39:21.768 --> 00:39:25.341
Jesus communicating with 5,000 or whatever.

927
00:39:25.341 --> 00:39:27.538
No way in the world would that ever happen.

928
00:39:27.538 --> 00:39:29.596
They government would not allow

929
00:39:29.596 --> 00:39:31.401
5,000 people to get together.

930
00:39:31.401 --> 00:39:32.989
How would they control them?

931
00:39:32.989 --> 00:39:35.708
With sticks and swords? Isn't going to work.

932
00:39:35.708 --> 00:39:37.106
And so, the parable was there

933
00:39:37.106 --> 00:39:38.652
to see if someone could answer it.

934
00:39:38.652 --> 00:39:40.859
If they could, then, they could have communion with God,

935
00:39:40.859 --> 00:39:41.969
so, not everyone was welcome.

936
00:39:41.969 --> 00:39:42.887
<v Regina>It's a coded language.</v>

937
00:39:42.887 --> 00:39:44.028
<v ->Yeah, it's a coded language.</v>

938
00:39:44.028 --> 00:39:46.950
Now, the book to read about this is "Pistis Sophia."

939
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:51.950
And in that (clears throat) you begin to see

940
00:39:52.688 --> 00:39:55.045
how this whole system worked.

941
00:39:55.045 --> 00:39:57.242
Now, who knows when it was really written,

942
00:39:57.242 --> 00:39:58.927
eighth century, ninth century or whatever,

943
00:39:58.927 --> 00:40:00.858
and things were added on later on.

944
00:40:00.858 --> 00:40:02.895
But, whoever wrote that had a pretty good idea

945
00:40:02.895 --> 00:40:04.798
as to what this was all about.

946
00:40:04.798 --> 00:40:09.798
In that particular text, it would be Gnostic,

947
00:40:09.918 --> 00:40:12.051
The people were told to write

948
00:40:12.051 --> 00:40:13.854
the things down that were told.

949
00:40:13.854 --> 00:40:15.763
And so, we're dealing with a literate group of people

950
00:40:15.763 --> 00:40:17.727
who are coming in to commune with God.

951
00:40:17.727 --> 00:40:20.434
And so, not everybody was welcome into these groups.

952
00:40:20.434 --> 00:40:25.394
Now, small little cults that we find around Israel

953
00:40:25.394 --> 00:40:28.455
and so on and so forth, most of the people

954
00:40:28.455 --> 00:40:30.887
coming into here could not read or write.

955
00:40:30.887 --> 00:40:34.452
But, if they could figure out the message in the parable,

956
00:40:34.452 --> 00:40:35.711
whatever the parable would be,

957
00:40:35.711 --> 00:40:37.663
then they could have communion.

958
00:40:37.663 --> 00:40:40.447
The rest, "We feel sorry for you, you're dumb and stupid,

959
00:40:40.447 --> 00:40:42.761
"and maybe later on, but not now."

960
00:40:42.761 --> 00:40:45.064
<v Regina>And comedian was a ritual.</v>

961
00:40:45.064 --> 00:40:46.953
<v ->It was a ritual that you were taken through,</v>

962
00:40:46.953 --> 00:40:48.617
and this is what I said earlier.

963
00:40:48.617 --> 00:40:50.323
If the person running the group,

964
00:40:50.323 --> 00:40:54.354
whether it was Jesus or whoever it might have been.

965
00:40:54.354 --> 00:40:57.319
John the Baptist, if he was a real person.

966
00:40:57.319 --> 00:41:01.682
If they did not train people to take over their position,

967
00:41:01.682 --> 00:41:05.201
if you did not have standard rituals (clears throat),

968
00:41:05.201 --> 00:41:09.468
if you do not have some way of financing the whole thing,

969
00:41:09.468 --> 00:41:11.622
once the original leader died,

970
00:41:11.622 --> 00:41:13.606
the whole thing would fall apart.

971
00:41:13.606 --> 00:41:16.143
Then, you get half-baked people out there

972
00:41:16.143 --> 00:41:18.244
running people through these rituals, and then,

973
00:41:18.244 --> 00:41:20.111
they start getting into trouble with it.

974
00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:21.412
And we see this today.

975
00:41:21.412 --> 00:41:22.530
<v Regina>Yeah, same thing,</v>

976
00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:23.586
I mean there is nothing reflected,

977
00:41:23.586 --> 00:41:24.716
in what you're talking about

978
00:41:24.716 --> 00:41:26.433
that's not reflect it in today's world.

979
00:41:26.433 --> 00:41:27.553
<v ->Right.</v>

980
00:41:27.553 --> 00:41:32.140
<v Regina>And you've taken so much of your</v>

981
00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.945
brain space and time to have created

982
00:41:34.945 --> 00:41:37.601
this incredible work which really takes people

983
00:41:37.601 --> 00:41:40.225
through all the different aspects of history,

984
00:41:40.225 --> 00:41:43.668
the various places in which this artwork starts appearing.

985
00:41:43.668 --> 00:41:47.839
The DVD has 242 images.
<v ->252 actually.</v>

986
00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:49.076
<v Regina>252, sorry about that.</v>

987
00:41:49.076 --> 00:41:51.764
And that's included with the book in the back.

988
00:41:51.764 --> 00:41:54.793
And really, it's a matter of meticulously going through

989
00:41:54.793 --> 00:41:56.190
and showing what was going on,

990
00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:58.953
what was the milieu of the day, who was in power,

991
00:41:58.953 --> 00:42:02.142
and the history surrounding the time

992
00:42:02.142 --> 00:42:04.627
when that particular piece of artwork

993
00:42:04.627 --> 00:42:06.067
appeared in that region.

994
00:42:06.067 --> 00:42:09.467
So, it's so saturated, like I said to you off-camera

995
00:42:09.467 --> 00:42:11.795
before we began, all we can do is just kind of

996
00:42:11.795 --> 00:42:15.155
set a stage for the subject, and people really

997
00:42:15.155 --> 00:42:18.344
need to just get the book and dig in to see

998
00:42:18.344 --> 00:42:19.966
the supporting material for that.

999
00:42:19.966 --> 00:42:22.184
And, that said,I think we've done a lovely job of

1000
00:42:22.184 --> 00:42:25.437
introducing the overlay, the context for all of this.

1001
00:42:25.437 --> 00:42:28.285
Now, any final thoughts before people

1002
00:42:28.285 --> 00:42:30.141
actually take this on and start looking?

1003
00:42:30.141 --> 00:42:33.757
<v ->You have to know what to look for in the motifs.</v>

1004
00:42:33.757 --> 00:42:36.177
And again, I'm certain that I'm wrong

1005
00:42:36.177 --> 00:42:38.630
on a few of these things, but, a lot of them I'm not.

1006
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:39.556
<v Regina>A lot of them are not obvious.</v>

1007
00:42:39.556 --> 00:42:41.659
You have to know what to look for, where to look for it,

1008
00:42:41.659 --> 00:42:43.269
When you see pointing in the images,

1009
00:42:43.269 --> 00:42:46.661
you have to know what that relates to.

1010
00:42:46.661 --> 00:42:49.242
When you see shoes, for example, in the images,

1011
00:42:49.242 --> 00:42:50.703
what does that mean?

1012
00:42:50.703 --> 00:42:54.586
A shoe is a transportation device.

1013
00:42:54.586 --> 00:42:57.572
Pontius Pilate, when you hear the name, that's a bridge.

1014
00:42:57.572 --> 00:42:59.119
And so, Pontius Pilate is a bridge

1015
00:42:59.119 --> 00:43:01.785
from the living to the non-living,

1016
00:43:01.785 --> 00:43:02.948
if you want to look at it that way.

1017
00:43:02.948 --> 00:43:05.432
So, there's a lot of motifs in here that you have to

1018
00:43:05.432 --> 00:43:07.054
really think about and know about

1019
00:43:07.054 --> 00:43:09.251
when you're looking at the art, or you'll miss it.

1020
00:43:09.251 --> 00:43:10.807
<v Regina>You do a good job of explaining it,</v>

1021
00:43:10.807 --> 00:43:12.983
though, in the book.

1022
00:43:12.983 --> 00:43:14.359
I thought you did a really good job.

1023
00:43:14.359 --> 00:43:16.129
<v ->Yeah, you know I put arrows on things,</v>

1024
00:43:16.129 --> 00:43:17.761
so that they can take a look at these

1025
00:43:17.761 --> 00:43:20.321
and then come to their own conclusions about this.

1026
00:43:20.321 --> 00:43:21.558
That's the main thing.

1027
00:43:21.558 --> 00:43:23.937
Read the book, come to your own conclusion on it.

1028
00:43:23.937 --> 00:43:26.176
<v Regina>Right. Well, I think it's fascinating work</v>

1029
00:43:26.176 --> 00:43:28.918
and it certainly brings into play for me,

1030
00:43:28.918 --> 00:43:32.192
a much more obvious explanation as to

1031
00:43:32.192 --> 00:43:35.019
why all the visioning was going on in the day.

1032
00:43:35.019 --> 00:43:35.990
<v ->Yeah. Oh, yeah.</v>

1033
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:37.536
<v Regina>(laughs) And goes on to this day.</v>

1034
00:43:37.536 --> 00:43:41.355
And thank you for becoming fascinated with

1035
00:43:41.355 --> 00:43:44.362
what I guess was once a very obscure subject

1036
00:43:44.362 --> 00:43:45.684
in bringing this to light.

1037
00:43:45.684 --> 00:43:48.767
I think especially you teach at a college,

1038
00:43:48.767 --> 00:43:50.207
and I would think that that generation

1039
00:43:50.207 --> 00:43:52.127
would be absolutely fascinated with this.

1040
00:43:52.127 --> 00:43:54.612
<v ->Yeah, I think when I first started mentioning this</v>

1041
00:43:54.612 --> 00:43:56.158
a few years ago, there was a lot of

1042
00:43:56.158 --> 00:43:57.908
skeptical eyes and whatnot.

1043
00:43:57.908 --> 00:44:01.193
And now, I don't think there's too many skeptics.

1044
00:44:01.193 --> 00:44:03.294
I mean there's a lot of people that are true believers

1045
00:44:03.294 --> 00:44:06.248
over there that perhaps don't like what I'm saying.

1046
00:44:06.248 --> 00:44:09.054
But, I'm not saying this maliciously.

1047
00:44:09.054 --> 00:44:12.936
In the "Failed God" book I was kind of malicious.

1048
00:44:12.936 --> 00:44:14.290
Because of what these systems are and

1049
00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:15.278
what they've done to people

1050
00:44:15.278 --> 00:44:17.347
and how they've controlled people.

1051
00:44:17.347 --> 00:44:19.427
And I look at Judaism, Christianity, Islam,

1052
00:44:19.427 --> 00:44:22.626
where they came from, what they stand for.

1053
00:44:22.626 --> 00:44:26.956
They are political systems, what their goals are and so on.

1054
00:44:26.956 --> 00:44:29.836
In this book, I simply looked at the material,

1055
00:44:29.836 --> 00:44:33.110
gave my opinion about it, and anyone can look at it

1056
00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:34.922
and they can come to their own conclusion.

1057
00:44:34.922 --> 00:44:36.180
<v Regina>As meanwhile, you've had a lot of</v>

1058
00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.133
your own direct experiences.

1059
00:44:38.133 --> 00:44:40.970
<v ->Absolutely. As an anthropologist,</v>

1060
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:43.848
our main methodology, if you will, of studying

1061
00:44:43.848 --> 00:44:45.833
is participant/observer.

1062
00:44:45.833 --> 00:44:47.177
If you don't participate...

1063
00:44:47.177 --> 00:44:49.556
I participated in a cult for three years.

1064
00:44:49.556 --> 00:44:51.710
So, I understand how these things work,

1065
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:53.524
at least how that one worked.

1066
00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:56.190
If you don't participate in the experiences

1067
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:58.206
with the substances, how can you know

1068
00:44:58.206 --> 00:45:00.851
how powerful they are, and so on?

1069
00:45:00.851 --> 00:45:02.632
But, how many times do you have to do it?

1070
00:45:02.632 --> 00:45:03.634
I mean you don't have to continually

1071
00:45:03.634 --> 00:45:06.642
take these substances to understand what they're all about.

1072
00:45:06.642 --> 00:45:09.298
<v Regina>And for you, did you have the,</v>

1073
00:45:09.298 --> 00:45:11.420
I say this loosely, religious experience

1074
00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:14.695
or the opening into the beyond,

1075
00:45:14.695 --> 00:45:16.274
knowledge beyond your neuro frame of reference?

1076
00:45:16.274 --> 00:45:18.397
<v ->Oh, absolutely, absolutely.</v>

1077
00:45:18.397 --> 00:45:22.888
With the amanita muscaria and the psilocybin,

1078
00:45:22.888 --> 00:45:25.829
the rituals that I participated in with those

1079
00:45:25.829 --> 00:45:29.562
were very profound, changed the way you see the world,

1080
00:45:29.562 --> 00:45:32.197
and see yourself.

1081
00:45:32.197 --> 00:45:34.235
And that's the danger in it, too.

1082
00:45:34.235 --> 00:45:35.674
Because someone could run you through

1083
00:45:35.674 --> 00:45:37.456
and really mess up your brain with it.

1084
00:45:37.456 --> 00:45:39.952
So you've got to trust people that you're with

1085
00:45:39.952 --> 00:45:41.477
during these rituals.

1086
00:45:41.477 --> 00:45:44.271
But, through my experiences with these,

1087
00:45:44.271 --> 00:45:48.506
I can identify with what they're saying in the Bible

1088
00:45:48.506 --> 00:45:50.586
in terms of the experiences that people are having,

1089
00:45:50.586 --> 00:45:55.586
whether it's Abraham or Moses or whatever it is.

1090
00:45:55.609 --> 00:45:57.643
And these are non-people.

1091
00:45:57.643 --> 00:45:59.222
There's no historical visibility

1092
00:45:59.222 --> 00:46:00.886
for these individuals at all.

1093
00:46:00.886 --> 00:46:04.980
And in both books I mention Moses as Akhenaten,

1094
00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:07.435
and the scholars know this.

1095
00:46:07.435 --> 00:46:08.779
<v Regina>Yes, I've read that before,</v>

1096
00:46:08.779 --> 00:46:10.101
Lawrence Gardner's work, too.

1097
00:46:10.101 --> 00:46:15.101
<v ->Underneath the lines, they say this is where</v>

1098
00:46:15.355 --> 00:46:18.447
(clears throat) Judaism came from, and so on.

1099
00:46:18.447 --> 00:46:19.663
But, for some reason, they don't want to

1100
00:46:19.663 --> 00:46:22.511
come right out and say it and put it in print

1101
00:46:22.511 --> 00:46:24.602
in bold type, if you will.

1102
00:46:24.602 --> 00:46:25.722
<v Regina>Right. Well, it would change</v>

1103
00:46:25.722 --> 00:46:27.268
the political game on the planet rather rapidly.

1104
00:46:27.268 --> 00:46:28.729
<v ->Absolutely, yeah.</v>

1105
00:46:28.729 --> 00:46:31.065
<v Regina>Yeah, well again, thank you for your time.</v>

1106
00:46:31.065 --> 00:46:33.433
And I encourage anyone that wants to look into it,

1107
00:46:33.433 --> 00:46:34.958
you've got a lot to look into here,

1108
00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:36.641
you well documented this.

1109
00:46:36.641 --> 00:46:37.536
<v ->Well, thank you very much,</v>

1110
00:46:37.536 --> 00:46:42.536
I appreciate you inviting me to talk, thanks.

1111
00:46:42.559 --> 00:46:44.959
<v ->You can do the research for yourself via John's book,</v>

1112
00:46:44.959 --> 00:46:48.767
and the companion CD, which shows over 200 illustrations,

1113
00:46:48.767 --> 00:46:50.186
and you can make your own mind up.

1114
00:46:50.186 --> 00:46:51.914
Meanwhile, for some similar perspectives

1115
00:46:51.914 --> 00:46:54.110
on early Christianity and Egypt,

1116
00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:56.692
you might also enjoy my interviews with Ralph Ellis.

1117
00:46:56.692 --> 00:46:59.717
Until next time, thanks for watching "CMN"
