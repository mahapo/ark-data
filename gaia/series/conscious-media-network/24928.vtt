00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>If you're a devotee
of Egyptology,

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.640 align:middle line:84%
you've likely seen "The
Mystery of the Sphinx"

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.870 align:middle line:84%
on the Discovery Channel, which
featured Dr. Robert Schoch's

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.690 align:middle line:84%
research as to the
true age of the Sphinx.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.210 align:middle line:84%
In our interview
with Dr. Schoch,

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.120 align:middle line:84%
he delves further into the
subject of ancient sites

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.020 align:middle line:84%
in sharing his
views as to how he

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.960 align:middle line:90%
believes these sites were used.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.130 align:middle line:84%
More so, he says
these sacred sites

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.580 align:middle line:84%
were chosen because of
their mystical properties

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.700 align:middle line:84%
and only enhanced
by the ancients

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.700 align:middle line:84%
in building some of the
world's greatest wonders

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.510 align:middle line:90%
on top of them.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:37.000 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.364 align:middle line:84%
>>I'm noticing a really
interesting trend

00:00:39.364 --> 00:00:40.530 align:middle line:90%
at the conference this year.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And when I was
listening to you talk,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.170 align:middle line:90%
it was exemplifying this a bit.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And that is that the scientific
community of yourself

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:84%
and some of your
compadres here have

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:84%
begun looking at
the notion that what

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:84%
we call the sacred sites
may actually be aligned more

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:84%
with natural
phenomena-- bumped up

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.610 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic
fields, for example.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little bit about
that from your own experience

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and what some of the
ramifications of that are?

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, from my own
experience-- as a geologist,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.230 align:middle line:84%
I always wondered
why do you have

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.870 align:middle line:84%
sacred sites in certain spots,
why were-- in some cases--

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle line:84%
the ancient peoples going
through extraordinary efforts

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.154 align:middle line:84%
to move blocks to
a certain spot.

00:01:24.154 --> 00:01:25.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why didn't
they just build

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.010 align:middle line:84%
where it was easier to
build-- that type of thing.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I always thought there
must be something--

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.490 align:middle line:90%
there must be some reason.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.956 align:middle line:84%
There must be some
rational reason

00:01:32.956 --> 00:01:34.330 align:middle line:84%
why they were
building where they

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.460 align:middle line:90%
were and not anywhere else.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what we're
finding with this geomagnetism,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.990 align:middle line:84%
for instance, and also
other physical parameters--

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:84%
but right now, we
seem to know the most

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.530 align:middle line:84%
about geomagnetic fluctuations--
that this, in fact, affects us.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.320 align:middle line:90%
And we are electrical organisms.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.100 align:middle line:84%
We are affected by magnetic
and electrical fields.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.450 align:middle line:84%
We realize that at a very
fundamental, cellular level.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it makes sense,
tied in with other research,

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:84%
that this does
affect consciousness,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.140 align:middle line:84%
does affect levels
of perception,

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.600 align:middle line:84%
does affect what
some people refer

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.160 align:middle line:84%
to as paranormal phenomena,
cyclical phenomena.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And what they were doing--
I believe at this point,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.530 align:middle line:84%
at least as a
working hypothesis--

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.080 align:middle line:84%
is that they were
finding sites that

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.426 align:middle line:84%
seemed to enhance
certain types of-- I'll

00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:26.570 align:middle line:84%
call it cyclical
phenomena, cyclical effects

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and, in some cases, taking
existing site like that

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.870 align:middle line:84%
and then further
building upon it

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.110 align:middle line:84%
with the sacred architecture,
with the megalithic structures,

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.070 align:middle line:84%
for instance, in various
cases, to further enhance what

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.756 align:middle line:90%
was already naturally there.

00:02:41.756 --> 00:02:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>And these people,
the ancients,

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.980 align:middle line:84%
didn't have, necessarily,
magnetometers or voltmeters.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.380 align:middle line:90%
They got it naturally.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.480 align:middle line:84%
They were able--
the shamanic forces.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.510 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
naturally pick it up.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And I don't necessarily
believe that everybody

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.710 align:middle line:84%
in a particular
ancient society was

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.240 align:middle line:84%
willing to do that or able
to do that, I should say,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.760 align:middle line:90%
but certainly some people were.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.260 align:middle line:84%
I think we have this
still in society today.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.062 align:middle line:84%
But one of the differences
is that, in our sort

00:03:09.062 --> 00:03:13.160 align:middle line:84%
of rationalistic, mechanistic
society, anyone that

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
claims to be able to
feel things or pick up

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.080 align:middle line:84%
certain sensations, as
a general rule of thumb,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.980 align:middle line:84%
modern, sort of traditional,
status quo society sort of

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.720 align:middle line:84%
laughs that off or, you
know, they're a little flaky,

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:90%
they're a little questionable.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not that hard
to do and it's not

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.330 align:middle line:84%
that hard to do
and replicate it.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And what you see
in other societies,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.640 align:middle line:84%
both contemporary
traditional societies

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and ancient
societies, I believe,

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.290 align:middle line:84%
is that people who had that
ability well-developed,

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.710 align:middle line:84%
they were held in high
esteem rather than being,

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.230 align:middle line:84%
in some cases, I hate to
say it, in modern societies,

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.050 align:middle line:84%
essentially being put in the
lunatic asylum or, at least,

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.152 align:middle line:84%
suggested that they
should be there.

00:03:57.152 --> 00:03:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>>Certainly, and
often these people

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.535 align:middle line:84%
were the priests
or the priestesses

00:04:00.535 --> 00:04:03.360 align:middle line:84%
or the shamans of the culture
and even into the Royalty,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.810 align:middle line:84%
which there's come indication
that they were actually

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:06.360 align:middle line:90%
initiates.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly, exactly, initiates.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And these were people that were
held in very, very high regard

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:84%
versus the opposite
that I'm afraid we

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.360 align:middle line:84%
see in modern
early 21st society,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.790 align:middle line:84%
generally-- not necessarily
people of a certain perception

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:84%
that I see at, for
instance, CPAK.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.562 align:middle line:84%
>>It's considered
esoteric still right now.

00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's becoming
more broad-based.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.660 align:middle line:84%
I think people are beginning
to get these-- they understand

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.540 align:middle line:90%
something feels a certain way.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't mind--
because you spent so much time

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.640 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt doing the incredible
work that we know you

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.720 align:middle line:84%
for-- let's focus a bit on the
pyramid-- the Great Pyramid,

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.160 align:middle line:84%
for example-- some of
the chambers and shafts

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Do you have some
specific ideas that

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.210 align:middle line:84%
are starting to sound
more real to you

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.140 align:middle line:84%
as to what these areas
might have been used for?

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>More and more, I
think, OK, besides-- I

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:84%
think there's two major
functions that were happening

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.360 align:middle line:84%
in the Great Pyramid-- not
necessarily simultaneously.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't think they were
simultaneous at all temporally.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And neither has anything
to do with being a tomb.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.290 align:middle line:84%
If it was ever used
as a tomb, that was--

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>That was one expensive
tomb, number one.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, exactly, exactly.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.670 align:middle line:84%
In the classic analogy,
I and other people

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.620 align:middle line:84%
have used is, well, maybe
some people were buried there

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.740 align:middle line:84%
at some point just
like cathedrals.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.360 align:middle line:84%
You have people
buried at cathedrals.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.490 align:middle line:84%
But we don't think of a
typical Western cathedral

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.480 align:middle line:84%
as being primarily
a tomb for a person

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.200 align:middle line:90%
or a tomb for several people.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:84%
So two major things I
think that are going on

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.620 align:middle line:84%
with the Great
Pyramid-- one is that it

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.590 align:middle line:84%
was used at early stage-- and
what I mean by early stage,

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.060 align:middle line:84%
before it looked like a
pyramid as we know it now,

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.270 align:middle line:84%
when it was essentially a
platform up to the 50th level

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.130 align:middle line:84%
or so-- the grand gallery
was open to the southern sky.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.120 align:middle line:84%
I think it was used
for what we would now

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:90%
call astronomical purposes.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Back then, it might
have been more

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.740 align:middle line:84%
what could be
considered, shall we say,

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.270 align:middle line:84%
astronomical-astrological
purposes.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
that is not horoscopes

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.630 align:middle line:84%
on an individual level
but tying the world

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.810 align:middle line:90%
into the larger cosmos.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.085 align:middle line:90%
>>The ages and constellations.

00:06:19.085 --> 00:06:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>The ages, the constellations,
the larger cosmos,

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.920 align:middle line:90%
and the larger cycle.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's amazing how
we are finding data today--

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:84%
in some cases very subtle--
but that our relationship,

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.690 align:middle line:84%
the relationship of the Earth,
and a person on the Earth,

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and the horizon of the
Earth at a certain time,

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:84%
relative, for instance,
to the galaxy,

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.530 align:middle line:84%
in the center of
the galaxy, actually

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.930 align:middle line:84%
has a subtle but
significant effect

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.720 align:middle line:84%
on our perception and
our consciousness.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>I was going to
ask you that next.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Can you expand on that,
because that's fascinating?

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.479 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
this conference is about,

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:02.650 align:middle line:84%
in essence, is the procession
of the equinox, which ties in.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>So I think these
large cosmic cycles--

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.630 align:middle line:84%
we are finding that they have a
subtle but important influence

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.650 align:middle line:90%
on consciousness.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And where you see this is
on the boundaries-- what

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.500 align:middle line:84%
I would call the boundaries
between the conventional--

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.980 align:middle line:84%
for instance, language
and talk and discussion--

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.352 align:middle line:84%
and what some people would
call intuitive aspects

00:07:22.352 --> 00:07:24.060 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
other people would call

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.687 align:middle line:84%
paranormal aspects of
consciousness, some people--

00:07:27.687 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:84%
one term that's used
for some of this,

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.480 align:middle line:84%
at least, is telepathic
communication.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that is
not literal-- one person

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:84%
reads another person's
mind-- but one person

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.260 align:middle line:84%
knows something sort of
instinctually about someone

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.460 align:middle line:84%
else who is maybe-- in most
cases-- close to them--

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:84%
personal friend or
family, that type

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:84%
of thing-- without the
normal channels of sense.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is
something that people

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.160 align:middle line:84%
laughed at for a long
time, in certain circles,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.850 align:middle line:84%
but it's also been
taken very seriously

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:01.070 align:middle line:84%
in certain circles--
rigorous scientific studies

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:05.680 align:middle line:84%
for a century now-- many
decades-- for a century or more

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.365 align:middle line:84%
now have been carried out--
that yes, it may be weak.

00:08:08.365 --> 00:08:10.050 align:middle line:90%
It may be a very weak signal.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.460 align:middle line:84%
It may be swamped
over by other things

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:18.320 align:middle line:84%
in our current state of
consciousness, but it is there.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore,
this weak signal

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.870 align:middle line:84%
is correlated with these cosmic
changes and these changes

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and these are
positioning, for instance,

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.700 align:middle line:84%
relative to the bigger galaxy,
the bigger universe, which

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.909 align:middle line:90%
is quite amazing.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>>It is amazing.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing people like
yourself and others

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.400 align:middle line:84%
that we've talked to-- people
who are steeped in science,

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.940 align:middle line:84%
rigorous science-- are now
saying, but hold on a minute,

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.520 align:middle line:90%
I've had these experiences.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>And also, it's very
interesting-- I've pointed this

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:53.190 align:middle line:84%
out in various talks
I've given-- that, to me,

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:55.800 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing, as
a scientist, when

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.560 align:middle line:84%
you get certain
sets of data-- data

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.190 align:middle line:84%
that was accumulated
over a period of more

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:84%
than 100 years of what we'll
call anomalous experiences,

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:10.700 align:middle line:84%
we'll call it telepathic
experiences-- typical cases are

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.150 align:middle line:84%
crisis experiences
where a mother realizes,

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.630 align:middle line:84%
she just instinctually
knows that something's

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.170 align:middle line:90%
wrong with her child.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Her child is hundreds
of miles away.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:84%
She has no reason to
think the child is sick

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.830 align:middle line:84%
or has an accident, but she
just knows something happened.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And then that's confirmed,
that that very time, the child

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:35.590 align:middle line:84%
broke his arm or was in
an accident or, worst case

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.090 align:middle line:90%
scenario, deceased.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are many rigorous,
well-corroborated cases

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.420 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, do we just dismiss them?

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>Most of us know someone
who has had this experience.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Or most of us have probably
had this experience ourself

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.730 align:middle line:90%
if we were to admit it.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And the typical
rational explanation

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.710 align:middle line:84%
is they're just
coincidence or it's fraud

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.239 align:middle line:84%
or it's faulty
recollections, not

00:09:59.239 --> 00:10:01.530 align:middle line:84%
that anyone is trying to
deceive someone purposefully--

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.500 align:middle line:84%
but they forgot that they had
heard about it first and then--

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.372 align:middle line:90%
and then thought about it.

00:10:07.372 --> 00:10:09.080 align:middle line:84%
But there are many
well-documented cases,

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:84%
especially-- and I find
it very interesting--

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.870 align:middle line:84%
especially late 19th century
cases-- before telephone,

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.600 align:middle line:84%
before telegraphs when
people were writing letters.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And it can be very
well-documented.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.060 align:middle line:84%
So you have a data
set like that.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Then, you have
independently, for instance,

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.570 align:middle line:84%
a data set of geomagnetic
fluctuations on Earth.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And when one starts to
correlate with the other one,

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:84%
to me, that's a very powerful
situation that very much says,

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.250 align:middle line:84%
well, this is a real phenomenon
in the physical world

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.640 align:middle line:84%
that is subject to
physical parameters

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.010 align:middle line:90%
and whatever is happening.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:46.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's not a radio signal.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.365 align:middle line:84%
And who knows what
it is but these

00:10:49.365 --> 00:10:51.530 align:middle line:90%
are large cyclical shifts.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:55.330 align:middle line:84%
But physical parameters
in the external world

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:84%
are affecting whatever
is going on here.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.100 align:middle line:84%
What are experiences
are, our consciousness.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.016 align:middle line:84%
>>And the nature of this
particular conference

00:11:03.016 --> 00:11:06.340 align:middle line:84%
is talking from many different
angles about the procession

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and what its influence on
mankind, on consciousness,

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.840 align:middle line:84%
bringing ancient
knowledge forward.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.310 align:middle line:90%
So what about the other part?

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:14.625 align:middle line:90%
Go back to the--

00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>The Great Pyramid,
I was about to say.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>>Back to the Great Pyramid
and that sarcophagus

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:84%
that couldn't get squeezed
through the opening

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.289 align:middle line:90%
into that chamber.

00:11:22.289 --> 00:11:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>So I think-- and
going back to what

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.740 align:middle line:84%
we're saying-- there's
two basic points I'll

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:90%
make about the Great Pyramid.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, one is that it was used for
astronomical observations tying

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.420 align:middle line:90%
to the larger cycle.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.540 align:middle line:84%
The second, I think, is that
they are demonstrating--

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.345 align:middle line:84%
the builders of
the Great Pyramid

00:11:37.345 --> 00:11:45.070 align:middle line:84%
are demonstrating incredible
feats of building, of coding,

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:49.024 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, a concept, if you
want to call it information.

00:11:49.024 --> 00:11:50.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
they were trying

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.690 align:middle line:84%
to get specific information to
us as much as a general concept

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:55.557 align:middle line:90%
that there--

00:11:55.557 --> 00:11:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>They're embedding some
information in that for future.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>>Exactly, some
information future--

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.840 align:middle line:84%
but sort of telling us that
the world was different

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.692 align:middle line:84%
back then so that we can have a
concept that it wasn't just-- I

00:12:07.692 --> 00:12:09.400 align:middle line:84%
hate to use the term--
but it wasn't just

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.570 align:middle line:90%
a bunch of primitive people.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think this ties in with
what I would see as another

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.270 align:middle line:84%
function of the Great Pyramid,
which is for ritualistic

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.440 align:middle line:84%
purposes-- I'll call
it that-- to, again,

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.600 align:middle line:84%
enhance consciousness and
to bring that enhancement

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:84%
to an individual
that's experiencing it,

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.920 align:middle line:84%
to go into the Great Pyramid--
which I've been there many

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.290 align:middle line:84%
times in all the
different chambers and--

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>Have you had some
experiences yourself in there?

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, yeah, it's a very--
I'll say it this way--

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.637 align:middle line:90%
very interesting place.

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>>Napoleon spent a night
in that sarcophagus

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and said it was the most
frightening experience.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>Exactly, and Napoleon
never really-- he

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.350 align:middle line:84%
was unwilling to
really talk in detail

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.440 align:middle line:84%
about exactly what
he experienced.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.800 align:middle line:90%
And this is Napoleon.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.040 align:middle line:90%
And he had strange experiences.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.260 align:middle line:84%
In the subterranean
chamber underneath,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.360 align:middle line:84%
well underneath the Great
Pyramid, which I think

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.734 align:middle line:84%
is probably the
earliest chamber,

00:13:04.734 --> 00:13:05.780 align:middle line:90%
the earliest part of it?

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:06.122 align:middle line:90%
>>And when would you date that?

00:13:06.122 --> 00:13:07.396 align:middle line:84%
Roughly how many years
ago, the earliest part?

00:13:07.396 --> 00:13:07.800 align:middle line:90%
Just, from what you know now.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>>Oh, that's really
hard to know.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think it definitely
goes into Predynastic time--

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:19.830 align:middle line:84%
so definitely 3500 or more
BC, just as a rough estimate

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:20.990 align:middle line:90%
but could be older.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.812 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's really hard to say.

00:13:23.812 --> 00:13:26.030 align:middle line:84%
But I think the main
point is that you're

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.630 align:middle line:84%
talking with the Great
Pyramid, as with so many

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:34.490 align:middle line:84%
incredible structures of
religious significance--

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:35.420 align:middle line:90%
I'll use that term.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.357 align:middle line:90%
You were talking a sacred site.

00:13:37.357 --> 00:13:39.190 align:middle line:84%
You were talking for
the Great Pyramid, what

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:84%
was a sacred mound
that they dug into when

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.160 align:middle line:90%
they did the descending passage.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So they made the
descending passage

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.602 align:middle line:84%
before the superstructure,
before what we now

00:13:49.602 --> 00:13:51.560 align:middle line:84%
know as the pyramid--
there was a sacred mound.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:84%
They built a descending
passage, going

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:84%
into what's known as the
subterranean chamber.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think they spent a
lot of time and energy--

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and that is perfectly
aligned, north and the south--

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and I mean, they weren't
doing this just randomly.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And many people have
expressed that they

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.110 align:middle line:84%
have very powerful
experiences, to this day,

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.745 align:middle line:90%
in the subterranean chambers.

00:14:15.745 --> 00:14:18.215 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is a
very ancient mound, very

00:14:18.215 --> 00:14:19.070 align:middle line:90%
ancient chamber.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And then, later, I believe that
they were adding to this mound.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.070 align:middle line:84%
They were building
the superstructure.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:28.680 align:middle line:84%
They were building it to use
as a astronomical observatory

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.030 align:middle line:84%
but also continued religious
purposes, ritualistic purposes,

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and what I would call initiation
purposes-- all of which,

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:41.510 align:middle line:84%
I feel, are to increase
cyclical phenomena,

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:45.740 align:middle line:84%
increase awareness, increase
consciousness, and increase

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.650 align:middle line:84%
our tie-- conscious and
sub-conscious and unconscious--

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:52.710 align:middle line:84%
tie to the larger picture,
the cosmos, the galaxies,

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:53.454 align:middle line:90%
the universe.

00:14:53.454 --> 00:14:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>And what do you see?

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Where are we right
now, as a species,

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.260 align:middle line:90%
in this whole continuum?

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>Hopefully, we're
ascending up again.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Because I think we've
gone through a stage

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.010 align:middle line:84%
and we're coming
out of a stage that

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.670 align:middle line:90%
was incredibly materialistic.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying there's
anything wrong with materialism

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:14.330 align:middle line:90%
to a certain extent.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's been
incredible benefits

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:22.140 align:middle line:84%
brought by modern technology
and modern society.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.650 align:middle line:84%
But when you lose sight of
other values and other aspects,

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:29.145 align:middle line:84%
those incredible benefits
can be turned for the worse.

00:15:29.145 --> 00:15:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>So do you think it
might be to our interest

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.060 align:middle line:84%
to start seeking out
places that are known

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.190 align:middle line:84%
for this magnetic or
geomagnetic kind of energetic?

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>>I think so.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.410 align:middle line:84%
I think, in general, it
might be beneficial to start

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:40.540 align:middle line:90%
seeking out-- yeah.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.527 align:middle line:90%
>>Make pilgrimages.

00:15:41.527 --> 00:15:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, pilgrimages.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And go back to pilgrimages
and the concept

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:48.890 align:middle line:84%
of sacred sites which do tie
in with these geomagnetic

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.970 align:middle line:90%
anomalies, in many cases.

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.600 align:middle line:84%
But just start
becoming more aware

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.630 align:middle line:84%
of the concept of the sacred,
the concept of consciousness.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that is
consciousness connectivity

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:07.600 align:middle line:84%
between individuals and from
humans to the rest of life,

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.350 align:middle line:84%
to the rest of the
universe, ultimately,

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.320 align:middle line:90%
the rest of the cosmos.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.170 align:middle line:84%
We have to realize, I
think-- and we're only

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.670 align:middle line:84%
starting to learn this-- that
what goes through one person's

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:19.510 align:middle line:90%
head doesn't stay there.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is a radical
notion, but it

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.530 align:middle line:84%
seems to be supported
by everything

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:27.300 align:middle line:84%
from certain interpretations
of quantum physics and quantum

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.660 align:middle line:84%
mechanics to what we're
seeing with these large-scale,

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.660 align:middle line:84%
consistent-- subtle but
consistent-- and statistically

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:84%
significant patterns of how
we're all tied together.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And we don't live in
a vacuum whatsoever.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And that was very much
the predominant paradigm,

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.810 align:middle line:84%
I think, in the past, that
individuals lived in vacuums

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and you could control--
in a physical sense--

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:56.910 align:middle line:90%
how you interacted.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.451 align:middle line:84%
But what was going through your
head, what you were thinking,

00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:02.235 align:middle line:84%
what your intentions
were-- didn't necessarily

00:17:02.235 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:90%
affect anything else.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:04.734 align:middle line:90%
And that's not true.

00:17:04.734 --> 00:17:05.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not true, at all.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>>It's amazing just how
much even this conference

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:09.589 align:middle line:90%
has changed in one year's time.

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And next year, even
more people will

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:14.310 align:middle line:84%
feel good about coming out
and speaking of these things.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:15.069 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So I hope it's
growing exponentially.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>From last year to this year,
I think it was a quantum leap.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.599 align:middle line:84%
And it was wonderful
seeing you here.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so
much for your time.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.049 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you very much.

00:17:26.049 --> 00:17:28.930 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>>If you're curious about the
topic of the new Egyptology

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.110 align:middle line:84%
as being presented by
a number of academics,

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.630 align:middle line:84%
you won't want to
miss our interview

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:39.110 align:middle line:84%
with his colleague, John Anthony
West, who also puts forth

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.780 align:middle line:84%
that the pyramids were built
in much more ancient times

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.130 align:middle line:84%
than believed and
for great purpose.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:45.940 align:middle line:84%
While attending the
CPAK conference,

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.030 align:middle line:84%
we also had a chance to speak
with Richard Hoagland, author

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.520 align:middle line:90%
of "The Monuments of Mars."

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.210 align:middle line:84%
I think you'll
like that one, too.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Until next time,
thanks for watching.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:05.184 align:middle line:90%
