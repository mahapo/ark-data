(ethereal instrumental music)

2
00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:07.508
<v ->Much can be explained regarding the</v>

3
00:00:07.508 --> 00:00:09.220
challenge of being human,

4
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.138
from the way in which we come into the world.

5
00:00:11.138 --> 00:00:14.019
That's according to Elena Tonetti Vladimirova.

6
00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:16.610
As a young Soviet woman from Siberia,

7
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.458
Elena sought enlightened answers

8
00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:21.315
about the soul, birth and creative community.

9
00:00:21.726 --> 00:00:24.540
She was magnetically attracted to a group of young people,

10
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.530
who chose to break out of the repression of Soviet life,

11
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.010
to create space for themselves, joy, and family.

12
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.444
With this intention, she came in contact

13
00:00:33.444 --> 00:00:35.041
with Igor Charkovsky,

14
00:00:35.124 --> 00:00:36.780
a Rasputin-like visionary,

15
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.436
who taught progressive young Soviets

16
00:00:38.436 --> 00:00:40.212
about underwater birthing,

17
00:00:40.212 --> 00:00:42.817
including birthing with dolphins.

18
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.308
Elena was by his side as his assistant for a few years,

19
00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:49.097
before stepping onto her own life long path,

20
00:00:49.097 --> 00:00:50.463
of conscious birthing.

21
00:00:52.925 --> 00:00:55.301
How pervasive is it,

22
00:00:55.301 --> 00:00:58.349
that each one of us walking around on this planet

23
00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:00.993
have experienced some sort of trauma,

24
00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:03.441
associated with our entry into the world,

25
00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:04.435
our births?

26
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:06.835
(Elena sighs heavily)

27
00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:10.415
<v ->To my estimation, it's about 98%</v>

28
00:01:11.253 --> 00:01:12.455
of people.

29
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:16.682
Legal statistics says 95%, but it's a fine line.

30
00:01:16.682 --> 00:01:18.986
Where do you draw the line, you know?

31
00:01:18.986 --> 00:01:23.462
Depends what do you use as a criteria of blissful birth,

32
00:01:23.462 --> 00:01:25.670
or just a normal birth, when,

33
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.110
you didn't show any kind of, um, you know, damage.

34
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.830
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

35
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.006
<v ->So--</v>

36
00:01:32.496 --> 00:01:34.556
<v Regina>But in reality, what's happening to us,</v>

37
00:01:34.556 --> 00:01:37.148
and the ways in which we've been brought into the world now,

38
00:01:37.148 --> 00:01:39.788
for the last few decades, in particular.

39
00:01:40.228 --> 00:01:41.859
And also, some of your own background,

40
00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:44.021
and the way people have been brought into the world.

41
00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:46.779
You came from a city in Siberia,

42
00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:48.493
that had their own practices.

43
00:01:48.763 --> 00:01:50.225
We know what the practices are in the United States,

44
00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:50.739
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

45
00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:52.203
<v ->and much of the West.</v>

46
00:01:52.203 --> 00:01:55.047
Talk about what has been, and what--

47
00:01:55.527 --> 00:01:58.419
the extent of the trauma, and its effect on our lives

48
00:01:58.419 --> 00:02:00.723
as a result of what we have been doing.

49
00:02:00.723 --> 00:02:02.355
<v ->Yeah, the--</v>

50
00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:05.468
It was not just inside Siberia.

51
00:02:05.468 --> 00:02:07.049
It was unanimous,

52
00:02:09.068 --> 00:02:13.981
spread through all 11 time zones in Russia.

53
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:15.007
That kind of practice.

54
00:02:15.227 --> 00:02:19.292
From the early '20's, the practice was that,

55
00:02:20.242 --> 00:02:22.378
all the babies were delivered in the

56
00:02:22.378 --> 00:02:24.508
State birth facility.

57
00:02:24.738 --> 00:02:28.798
It's that standard three-story building-- barrack basically.

58
00:02:28.798 --> 00:02:29.458
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

59
00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:32.458
<v ->The first floor was for abortions.</v>

60
00:02:32.778 --> 00:02:35.540
The abortions was the only known form

61
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.570
of birth control at that time.

62
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:38.410
<v Regina>And encouraged.</v>

63
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.306
<v ->In the generation of my mother,</v>

64
00:02:40.306 --> 00:02:41.002
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

65
00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:44.194
<v ->the average amount of abortions per woman</v>

66
00:02:44.194 --> 00:02:45.586
was 23.

67
00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:46.522
(Regina gasps)

68
00:02:46.522 --> 00:02:48.562
<v Elena>Done without anesth--</v>
<v Regina>Oh my--</v>

69
00:02:48.562 --> 00:02:49.642
<v ->any kind of anesthetics.</v>

70
00:02:49.642 --> 00:02:50.458
<v Regina>Oh my God--</v>
<v Elena>Yeah.</v>

71
00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:51.874
<v Regina>I had no idea that that was the--</v>
<v Elena>Yeah.</v>

72
00:02:51.874 --> 00:02:54.202
<v Regina>Why didn't they offer birth control?</v>

73
00:02:54.202 --> 00:02:54.778
Was there--

74
00:02:54.778 --> 00:02:55.508
<v ->It was not known of.</v>

75
00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:56.674
<v Regina>Were there condoms, or?</v>

76
00:02:57.744 --> 00:03:00.272
<v ->It was not known of, but also,</v>

77
00:03:00.912 --> 00:03:03.402
was scarcely available.

78
00:03:03.402 --> 00:03:04.022
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

79
00:03:04.022 --> 00:03:06.721
It was available, but, it was, you know.

80
00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:08.784
Soviet kind of condom. (laughs)

81
00:03:08.784 --> 00:03:09.696
<v Regina>Goodness.</v>

82
00:03:09.696 --> 00:03:12.249
So maybe it wasn't that well-made anyway. (laughs)

83
00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:13.223
No offense.

84
00:03:15.983 --> 00:03:19.074
<v ->It would be, you know, unthinkable,</v>

85
00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:22.266
to expect a Russian man to put one of those on.

86
00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:23.514
<v Regina>Okay, so we have psychology--</v>

87
00:03:23.514 --> 00:03:24.138
<v ->Right.</v>

88
00:03:24.138 --> 00:03:25.386
<v Regina>culture, a lot of things involved.</v>

89
00:03:25.386 --> 00:03:26.490
<v ->Also, right.</v>

90
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.426
Lots of things.

91
00:03:27.426 --> 00:03:29.226
Also, there was no Sex Ed.

92
00:03:29.226 --> 00:03:30.738
<v Regina>No sexual education, yeah.</v>

93
00:03:30.738 --> 00:03:32.562
There was no information about,

94
00:03:32.562 --> 00:03:34.818
why, when people get pregnant, so.

95
00:03:34.818 --> 00:03:36.618
<v Regina>So first floor is abortions--</v>

96
00:03:36.618 --> 00:03:37.098
<v ->Yeah.</v>

97
00:03:37.098 --> 00:03:39.402
<v Regina>And also, there is very little space,</v>

98
00:03:39.402 --> 00:03:41.394
so families couldn't have multiple children--

99
00:03:41.394 --> 00:03:42.018
<v ->Right.</v>

100
00:03:42.018 --> 00:03:44.301
Right, there is a saying in Russia.

101
00:03:44.301 --> 00:03:47.778
If you have a child, you are a good woman.

102
00:03:47.778 --> 00:03:50.706
If you have two children, you're a national hero.

103
00:03:50.706 --> 00:03:53.346
If you have three children, you're an idiot.

104
00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:54.834
<v Regina>Mmhmm, okay.</v>

105
00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:59.030
<v ->That was reflecting the situation, you know, was,</v>

106
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.069
(laughs) child-producing in Soviet Russia at the time.

107
00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.071
<v Regina>Well, and, we've ta-- we were talking earlier.</v>

108
00:04:05.071 --> 00:04:06.285
For practical reasons,

109
00:04:06.285 --> 00:04:08.517
if you're living in a postage stamp apartment,

110
00:04:08.517 --> 00:04:09.741
with your in-laws and everybody else--

111
00:04:09.741 --> 00:04:10.677
<v ->Right. Right.</v>

112
00:04:10.677 --> 00:04:12.765
<v Regina>in another barracks-like building--</v>

113
00:04:12.765 --> 00:04:13.197
<v ->Right.</v>

114
00:04:13.197 --> 00:04:14.745
<v Regina>you can't fit a lot of children in.</v>

115
00:04:14.745 --> 00:04:17.001
<v ->There's simply no physical space to put them--</v>

116
00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:17.685
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

117
00:04:17.685 --> 00:04:19.019
<v ->and the crib, there's-- you know.</v>

118
00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:19.813
Where do you put it?

119
00:04:19.813 --> 00:04:21.259
On the dining table?

120
00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.769
<v Regina>So you go to the abortion clinic on Floor One.</v>

121
00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:24.213
<v ->Yeah.</v>

122
00:04:24.213 --> 00:04:26.349
And every morning there would be

123
00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.013
lines curling up around the block,

124
00:04:29.013 --> 00:04:30.086
women

125
00:04:30.515 --> 00:04:32.978
waiting their turn to get

126
00:04:33.448 --> 00:04:34.406
an abortion.

127
00:04:34.406 --> 00:04:38.311
So basically, by the time a woman gets on the 2nd Floor--

128
00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:38.904
<v Regina>Which is--</v>

129
00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:40.622
<v ->where all the laboring women are--</v>

130
00:04:40.622 --> 00:04:41.512
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

131
00:04:41.972 --> 00:04:44.798
<v ->she already been in the 1st Floor a few times,</v>

132
00:04:44.798 --> 00:04:48.902
and she already has relationships with this building,

133
00:04:48.902 --> 00:04:50.702
and with that place, and with her--

134
00:04:50.702 --> 00:04:51.614
<v Regina>A very negative--</v>

135
00:04:51.614 --> 00:04:54.806
<v ->her ability to procreate.</v>

136
00:04:54.806 --> 00:04:55.598
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

137
00:04:55.598 --> 00:05:00.422
<v ->And, basically, that was not a happy place,</v>

138
00:05:00.422 --> 00:05:03.638
and it's just one big space where all this

139
00:05:03.638 --> 00:05:06.614
dozens of women are all in labor at the same time,

140
00:05:06.614 --> 00:05:08.352
completely stressed out,

141
00:05:09.014 --> 00:05:13.634
in those horrible bags of, you know,

142
00:05:14.274 --> 00:05:15.745
hospital robe.

143
00:05:16.195 --> 00:05:17.360
Shaved badly.

144
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.544
They would be shaved like, (pfffew) like this--

145
00:05:19.544 --> 00:05:20.000
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

146
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.256
<v ->with cuts and then--</v>

147
00:05:21.256 --> 00:05:22.123
<v ->You know, just--</v>

148
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.040
being basically abused by the personnel.

149
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.432
Called names.

150
00:05:26.432 --> 00:05:30.016
Being slapped sometimes, and, yelled at, and.

151
00:05:30.016 --> 00:05:33.322
And all the husbands are not even allowed in the building.

152
00:05:33.322 --> 00:05:33.872
<v Regina>Mmm.</v>

153
00:05:33.872 --> 00:05:36.224
<v ->They would be standing, a big crowd of men,</v>

154
00:05:37.254 --> 00:05:39.291
outside, you know, with flowers,

155
00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:41.043
just looking in the windows,

156
00:05:41.043 --> 00:05:41.645
<v Regina>Oh.</v>

157
00:05:41.645 --> 00:05:43.321
trying to find where his wife is,

158
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.827
and if--

159
00:05:45.507 --> 00:05:47.982
I remember those scenes from my childhood.

160
00:05:49.252 --> 00:05:51.999
Passing by-- riding in a trolley,

161
00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:58.242
looking, windows, covered with those pale scared faces,

162
00:05:58.242 --> 00:05:59.875
looking for their husbands.

163
00:06:01.505 --> 00:06:04.455
And the-- this crowd of husbands, and,

164
00:06:04.455 --> 00:06:07.519
it's cold, so, they would be in those black fur hats--

165
00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:09.082
<v Regina>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

166
00:06:09.082 --> 00:06:13.219
<v ->And coats, so it's this crowd of black men,</v>

167
00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.955
just writing on the snow, "I love you," and--

168
00:06:16.955 --> 00:06:17.531
<v Regina>Oh.</v>

169
00:06:17.531 --> 00:06:20.387
<v ->and sticking flowers in the snow, and,</v>

170
00:06:20.387 --> 00:06:24.110
it just was such a pathetic, pathetic scene.

171
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.620
Nobody was looking forward to going to this place,

172
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.439
and then, on the 3rd Floor,

173
00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:33.119
there would be all the babies,

174
00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:36.047
stored, you know, in their little boxes--

175
00:06:36.047 --> 00:06:36.743
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

176
00:06:36.743 --> 00:06:37.679
<v ->alone.</v>

177
00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:40.243
Babies were taken away for five days after birth.

178
00:06:40.243 --> 00:06:42.019
<v Regina>(gasps) Five days.</v>

179
00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:44.279
What was the thinking there?

180
00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.791
Besides to just break the bond with the mother?

181
00:06:47.791 --> 00:06:49.175
What could they be thinking?

182
00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:51.863
<v ->I don't think there was much thinking involved.</v>

183
00:06:51.863 --> 00:06:53.687
<v Regina>But what was the rationale for taking a--</v>

184
00:06:53.687 --> 00:06:54.959
when they need to nurse?

185
00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:56.447
<v ->To give the mother to rest.</v>

186
00:06:56.447 --> 00:06:57.479
Just to--

187
00:06:59.239 --> 00:07:00.775
"You should be resting." (laugh)

188
00:07:00.775 --> 00:07:02.335
<v Regina>Well, the baby needed</v>

189
00:07:02.335 --> 00:07:03.487
sustenance and bonding.

190
00:07:03.487 --> 00:07:04.975
<v ->Well, the baby needed sustenance,</v>

191
00:07:04.975 --> 00:07:07.501
and the mother needed, you know, to relieve her breasts,

192
00:07:07.501 --> 00:07:08.729
<v Regina>To bond, yes.</v>

193
00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:10.759
because by the time a baby is

194
00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:12.511
given to her five days later--

195
00:07:12.511 --> 00:07:13.303
<v Regina>Oh boy--</v>

196
00:07:13.303 --> 00:07:13.725
<v ->her-- the breasts are--</v>

197
00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:15.073
<v Regina>painful.</v>

198
00:07:15.487 --> 00:07:16.591
<v ->painful to look at,</v>

199
00:07:16.591 --> 00:07:19.714
nevermind put it into a baby's mouth, you know?

200
00:07:20.254 --> 00:07:23.767
And babies were given sugary water with tranquilizers

201
00:07:23.767 --> 00:07:26.383
the whole time, to keep them quiet.

202
00:07:26.773 --> 00:07:31.253
It's basically, that absurd twilight zone kind of

203
00:07:31.483 --> 00:07:33.431
reality of Mother Russia,

204
00:07:33.679 --> 00:07:38.063
that is the reflection of this orphanage mentality.

205
00:07:38.488 --> 00:07:43.172
This is the (laughs) you know, direct consequence,

206
00:07:43.492 --> 00:07:47.204
of the way babies were treated for few generations.

207
00:07:48.004 --> 00:07:49.852
Nothing makes much sense,

208
00:07:49.852 --> 00:07:51.484
and the main thing is,

209
00:07:51.484 --> 00:07:54.652
very difficult for people to come together,

210
00:07:54.652 --> 00:07:56.018
to do something.

211
00:07:56.018 --> 00:07:58.684
That's why, what I was describing earlier,

212
00:07:58.684 --> 00:08:01.396
has such an amazing meaning, because,

213
00:08:02.986 --> 00:08:05.146
the community is something that is

214
00:08:05.146 --> 00:08:08.194
so out of comfort zone for Russian people.

215
00:08:09.004 --> 00:08:13.846
That loneliness is programmed into our nervous system.

216
00:08:14.256 --> 00:08:17.977
It's basically, by the time five days are over,

217
00:08:18.747 --> 00:08:22.088
on baby's time, it equals to eternity.

218
00:08:22.088 --> 00:08:23.480
There is no

219
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.407
expectation

220
00:08:26.727 --> 00:08:29.709
by the time of, five days are over,

221
00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:31.557
the baby is not expecting

222
00:08:32.041 --> 00:08:35.010
that there is anybody, somebody, out there

223
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.546
in this whole universe,

224
00:08:36.966 --> 00:08:41.126
that will know how to meet baby's needs.

225
00:08:41.496 --> 00:08:43.890
<v Regina>What an enlightening story,</v>

226
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:44.946
that you've just shared.

227
00:08:44.946 --> 00:08:46.242
I had no idea.

228
00:08:46.242 --> 00:08:46.770
<v ->Yeah.</v>

229
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.498
<v Regina>I mean, we thought it was harsh,</v>

230
00:08:48.498 --> 00:08:51.378
in American hospitals, to have a baby delivered.

231
00:08:51.968 --> 00:08:53.418
And it's a different situation.

232
00:08:53.418 --> 00:08:57.882
But that is-- brought to my eyes just to hear you

233
00:08:58.242 --> 00:09:00.114
talk about how harsh that was.

234
00:09:00.114 --> 00:09:01.026
<v ->Yeah.</v>

235
00:09:01.026 --> 00:09:03.486
<v Regina>Then, so no surprise for you,</v>

236
00:09:03.486 --> 00:09:04.966
as a compassionate being--

237
00:09:04.966 --> 00:09:05.990
<v ->Yeah.</v>

238
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.498
<v Regina>who was already being exposed to,</v>

239
00:09:08.498 --> 00:09:10.770
whole new horizons of thinking,

240
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.258
and a mover and shaker,

241
00:09:12.258 --> 00:09:14.970
in the arena of creating new communities,

242
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.526
based on fundamental truths that are whole and good,

243
00:09:18.526 --> 00:09:19.498
<v ->Yeah.</v>

244
00:09:19.498 --> 00:09:21.010
<v Regina>that you would find yourself</v>

245
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.360
gravitating toward birth.

246
00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.898
And what was the step for you,

247
00:09:23.898 --> 00:09:26.791
that took you into conscious birth, then?

248
00:09:27.216 --> 00:09:29.640
<v ->Well, that's a thing that, um,</v>

249
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.823
I was deeply in love with my husband, who was,

250
00:09:35.728 --> 00:09:38.234
conducting these amazing

251
00:09:39.238 --> 00:09:41.037
games, the seminars--

252
00:09:41.037 --> 00:09:41.829
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

253
00:09:42.219 --> 00:09:46.165
<v ->He was absolutely dedicated to improving life,</v>

254
00:09:46.942 --> 00:09:49.220
in our Motherland.

255
00:09:49.979 --> 00:09:51.904
And that's actually where we met.

256
00:09:51.904 --> 00:09:56.904
I saw him at one of the games where I was invited to attend.

257
00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.896
And it just impressed me so deeply, and this whole,

258
00:09:59.896 --> 00:10:01.816
approach of trying to improve

259
00:10:01.816 --> 00:10:04.312
the quality of life of the people.

260
00:10:05.262 --> 00:10:08.727
And it was such an effective way of doing so.

261
00:10:09.254 --> 00:10:12.394
So, when I started traveling with him,

262
00:10:12.394 --> 00:10:14.068
conducting those games,

263
00:10:14.512 --> 00:10:18.538
at this time, I was asked to meet with this man,

264
00:10:18.538 --> 00:10:19.714
Igor Charkovsky.

265
00:10:19.714 --> 00:10:22.018
That he has some brilliant idea,

266
00:10:22.018 --> 00:10:24.051
but he's alone trying to,

267
00:10:24.516 --> 00:10:26.218
you know, promote it, for 20 years,

268
00:10:26.218 --> 00:10:27.878
and he's gotten nowhere with it.

269
00:10:27.878 --> 00:10:31.906
It's only five women who sort of are listening to him,

270
00:10:32.256 --> 00:10:36.472
and the rest of the world can not comprehend

271
00:10:36.472 --> 00:10:39.255
why a self-respecting laboring woman

272
00:10:39.255 --> 00:10:40.695
would get in the water.

273
00:10:40.695 --> 00:10:41.343
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

274
00:10:41.343 --> 00:10:42.737
<v ->You know, it's like,</v>

275
00:10:42.737 --> 00:10:44.175
"Could you please talk to him,

276
00:10:44.175 --> 00:10:46.047
"and I know that you are working with this,

277
00:10:46.047 --> 00:10:48.567
"brainstorming technologies, so"--

278
00:10:48.567 --> 00:10:49.143
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

279
00:10:49.143 --> 00:10:51.495
<v ->"could you maybe, help him to get his--</v>

280
00:10:52.245 --> 00:10:54.757
"Sounds like he's got something really good,

281
00:10:55.247 --> 00:10:57.003
"so maybe you could help him."

282
00:10:57.273 --> 00:10:59.367
So because the person I,

283
00:11:01.977 --> 00:11:04.816
the person who asked me, I respect him a lot,

284
00:11:04.816 --> 00:11:06.544
I agreed to meet with him.

285
00:11:06.964 --> 00:11:11.559
And our meeting lasted for four hours.

286
00:11:11.559 --> 00:11:15.075
In four hours, Igor Charkovsky basically downloaded

287
00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:19.278
about 25 years of his

288
00:11:21.265 --> 00:11:24.499
research in the field of prenatal psychology.

289
00:11:24.499 --> 00:11:27.907
And at that time, of course, there was no such term,

290
00:11:27.907 --> 00:11:29.443
prenatal psychology.

291
00:11:29.443 --> 00:11:32.707
Or, neither would he call it research.

292
00:11:32.707 --> 00:11:34.291
He was just basically,

293
00:11:35.741 --> 00:11:38.299
basically, connecting the dots.

294
00:11:39.249 --> 00:11:40.249
It was-- he--

295
00:11:40.249 --> 00:11:42.488
If there is a Siberian Shaman,

296
00:11:43.208 --> 00:11:47.272
ever, surviving, you know, all the hardships of

297
00:11:47.952 --> 00:11:49.192
Soviet reality,

298
00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:51.896
he is the one.

299
00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:54.160
He has this amazing ability

300
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.768
to perceive through time and space,

301
00:11:58.768 --> 00:12:01.000
to look into the past and the future.

302
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.760
He has one of those, really Earthy, Rasputin-type,

303
00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.904
kind of personalities, very,

304
00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:12.919
wild and socially inappropriate, but,

305
00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:16.735
absolutely brilliant healer and very powerful,

306
00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:19.759
charismatic being.

307
00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:22.471
But at the same time, he couldn't really,

308
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:27.240
communicate himself properly, with the,

309
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.699
speed of his downloads--

310
00:12:29.699 --> 00:12:30.347
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

311
00:12:30.347 --> 00:12:35.249
<v ->of what is, his speech would be, confused.</v>

312
00:12:35.249 --> 00:12:37.259
You know, in one sentence there would be

313
00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:39.507
pieces from five different realities, and--

314
00:12:39.507 --> 00:12:40.561
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

315
00:12:40.561 --> 00:12:42.491
<v ->of five different universes,</v>

316
00:12:42.491 --> 00:12:45.923
and it was really hard for him to communicate himself,

317
00:12:45.923 --> 00:12:49.451
but somehow I was able to understand what he was saying.

318
00:12:50.221 --> 00:12:54.784
And, by the time the four hours were over,

319
00:12:54.784 --> 00:12:56.024
I got the scoop.

320
00:12:56.024 --> 00:12:58.266
It was very clear to me that everything

321
00:12:58.266 --> 00:12:59.748
we're doing with our games,

322
00:12:59.748 --> 00:13:03.152
is just putting bandaids on big wounds that,

323
00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:07.272
you know, are being created over and over,

324
00:13:07.272 --> 00:13:09.710
with the birth of every citizen.

325
00:13:10.216 --> 00:13:12.368
So, everything we were doing,

326
00:13:12.368 --> 00:13:15.244
was absolutely inefficient,

327
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:20.560
because the mess keeps multiplying proportionately.

328
00:13:20.763 --> 00:13:23.835
And basically, he just said, you know,

329
00:13:23.835 --> 00:13:27.539
"If you want to get to the core of the problem,

330
00:13:27.539 --> 00:13:30.051
"you need to change the way we are born."

331
00:13:30.501 --> 00:13:34.779
And it was (sighs deeply) such a clear

332
00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:37.100
vision and understanding.

333
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.239
I went home, and I said,

334
00:13:38.239 --> 00:13:40.058
"This (laughs) is what we're doing now."

335
00:13:40.058 --> 00:13:40.490
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

336
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.505
<v ->So we started meeting weekly,</v>

337
00:13:42.976 --> 00:13:45.030
weekly, with our

338
00:13:45.482 --> 00:13:48.850
16-people strong team of--

339
00:13:49.756 --> 00:13:51.258
<v Regina>Game technicians, you called yourself,</v>

340
00:13:51.258 --> 00:13:51.984
<v ->Game technicians.</v>

341
00:13:51.984 --> 00:13:53.508
<v Regina>as I recall in our last talk, yes.</v>

342
00:13:53.508 --> 00:13:56.021
<v ->Yes, so, yeah, and,</v>

343
00:13:56.021 --> 00:13:59.210
spin that whole magic theater, into trying to figure out,

344
00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.394
how to, um,

345
00:14:01.974 --> 00:14:03.760
how to reach,

346
00:14:05.251 --> 00:14:07.068
the women, the young men.

347
00:14:07.068 --> 00:14:09.716
How to make them know about

348
00:14:09.996 --> 00:14:12.444
the implications of the quality of

349
00:14:12.444 --> 00:14:15.710
the way they conceive and gestate the new baby, and,

350
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:17.244
the way they give birth.

351
00:14:17.244 --> 00:14:20.323
How do we (laughs) spread the message?

352
00:14:20.323 --> 00:14:21.019
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

353
00:14:21.019 --> 00:14:22.747
<v ->And, pretty soon,</v>

354
00:14:23.477 --> 00:14:25.507
it was a whole movement.

355
00:14:25.507 --> 00:14:28.298
Classes were going, and,

356
00:14:28.771 --> 00:14:31.963
because nobody really knew anything about it,

357
00:14:31.963 --> 00:14:34.060
we had to, basically,

358
00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.252
invent, from scratch.

359
00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:40.091
We were looking for every piece of

360
00:14:40.246 --> 00:14:41.970
knowledge or advice.

361
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.594
Medical school did not provide any information,

362
00:14:45.594 --> 00:14:47.898
because it was all about how to manipulate

363
00:14:47.898 --> 00:14:49.722
the woman and the baby.

364
00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.616
And we were trying to find a way

365
00:14:51.616 --> 00:14:53.822
how to avoid any kind of

366
00:14:54.492 --> 00:14:56.976
manipulation or complication.

367
00:14:56.976 --> 00:14:59.898
So, Igor Charkovsky, of course,

368
00:14:59.898 --> 00:15:02.790
was the key person at that time, because,

369
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:06.834
with his ability to see, just--

370
00:15:06.834 --> 00:15:07.530
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

371
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:08.514
<v ->He is a seer, he's</v>

372
00:15:10.204 --> 00:15:11.392
just a psychic.

373
00:15:12.991 --> 00:15:14.246
(laughs) Genius.

374
00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:15.254
<v Regina>(mumbles) soul that can connect</v>

375
00:15:15.254 --> 00:15:16.636
information from everywhere, yeah.

376
00:15:16.636 --> 00:15:17.572
<v ->And he is a genius.</v>

377
00:15:17.572 --> 00:15:17.998
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

378
00:15:17.998 --> 00:15:18.940
<v ->He still is.</v>

379
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.282
He is now in his mid-70's, but,

380
00:15:21.282 --> 00:15:23.500
as strong and charismatic and

381
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.089
beautiful and powerful as he was--

382
00:15:26.089 --> 00:15:26.857
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

383
00:15:26.857 --> 00:15:29.000
<v ->thirty years ago, when I met him.</v>

384
00:15:32.769 --> 00:15:35.718
And basically, he was guiding us through

385
00:15:35.718 --> 00:15:38.608
understanding of how it is all connected.

386
00:15:38.608 --> 00:15:40.347
The continuing concept

387
00:15:40.347 --> 00:15:43.713
in the family female lineage.

388
00:15:44.008 --> 00:15:46.615
How a pregnant woman

389
00:15:47.003 --> 00:15:49.688
is a reflection of her

390
00:15:51.414 --> 00:15:54.344
past emotional and psychological

391
00:15:56.529 --> 00:15:59.119
landscape, and how that is affected

392
00:15:59.119 --> 00:16:03.017
by her mother's emotional life,

393
00:16:03.017 --> 00:16:05.695
and how that is affected by her grandmother's,

394
00:16:05.695 --> 00:16:07.491
and great-grandmother's.

395
00:16:07.491 --> 00:16:12.064
And how that lineage is absolutely intertwined,

396
00:16:12.489 --> 00:16:15.263
and pregnancy activates

397
00:16:15.263 --> 00:16:18.126
everything that was there unresolved,

398
00:16:18.126 --> 00:16:21.631
and left, sort of stagnant,

399
00:16:22.488 --> 00:16:24.480
for eons, who knows?

400
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.046
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

401
00:16:25.046 --> 00:16:30.046
<v ->And with Igor's ability to perceive that reality,</v>

402
00:16:30.302 --> 00:16:31.958
he was teaching us--

403
00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.610
With every woman, we would learn

404
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:38.740
a new world of connections and correlations,

405
00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:43.504
and how to neutralize the dependency from those

406
00:16:43.504 --> 00:16:46.277
past situations, and the past situation,

407
00:16:47.747 --> 00:16:52.747
could be basically anything, but, mainly the,

408
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:57.129
reason for complications at birth,

409
00:16:57.129 --> 00:16:59.841
was coming up as a betrayal of love.

410
00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:02.316
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

411
00:17:03.496 --> 00:17:04.544
<v ->Isn't that interesting?</v>

412
00:17:04.544 --> 00:17:05.408
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

413
00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:06.512
<v ->That it--</v>

414
00:17:06.512 --> 00:17:07.688
<v Regina>That's what he was seeing,</v>

415
00:17:07.688 --> 00:17:08.240
<v ->Yeah.</v>

416
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.200
<v Regina>in this continuum.</v>

417
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:09.896
<v ->Yeah.</v>

418
00:17:09.896 --> 00:17:10.592
<v Regina>A betrayal of love,</v>

419
00:17:10.592 --> 00:17:11.816
which almost every human being

420
00:17:11.816 --> 00:17:12.992
<v ->A betrayal of love, I know, yeah--</v>

421
00:17:12.992 --> 00:17:13.856
<v Regina>has experienced.</v>

422
00:17:13.856 --> 00:17:15.754
<v ->And it could be that</v>

423
00:17:15.754 --> 00:17:18.512
a woman's love was betrayed, or,

424
00:17:18.512 --> 00:17:19.892
she betrayed, um--

425
00:17:19.892 --> 00:17:20.504
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

426
00:17:20.504 --> 00:17:21.872
<v ->some true love.</v>

427
00:17:21.872 --> 00:17:25.208
And it could be, you know, at the age 13, or,

428
00:17:27.488 --> 00:17:29.550
first grade or something.

429
00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.566
Or their high school sweetheart.

430
00:17:32.746 --> 00:17:36.679
Or actually, directly with the father of the baby.

431
00:17:36.679 --> 00:17:40.423
Or when the mother was pregnant with this woman,

432
00:17:40.423 --> 00:17:43.111
so with the father of this woman.

433
00:17:43.491 --> 00:17:46.423
Or, the father of this baby, so--

434
00:17:46.423 --> 00:17:47.071
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

435
00:17:47.071 --> 00:17:50.361
<v ->It's like, a holographic</v>

436
00:17:50.951 --> 00:17:52.987
picture evolves, how,

437
00:17:52.987 --> 00:17:56.431
when you zoom in to one particular situation,

438
00:17:56.431 --> 00:17:58.327
and all of a sudden, um,

439
00:17:59.507 --> 00:18:03.058
the whole lifetime unfolds,

440
00:18:03.058 --> 00:18:05.746
in that one particular place.

441
00:18:05.746 --> 00:18:06.370
You know what I mean?

442
00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:06.874
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

443
00:18:06.874 --> 00:18:11.650
<v ->And, when we were learning,</v>

444
00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:15.275
how it all intertwined and connected,

445
00:18:15.275 --> 00:18:18.466
we started to learn, how do we undo,

446
00:18:18.466 --> 00:18:21.478
our dependency on that continue.

447
00:18:21.478 --> 00:18:24.442
How can we neutralize all the negativity

448
00:18:24.442 --> 00:18:27.442
that is stored in our genes and our cells,

449
00:18:27.442 --> 00:18:29.674
in our emotional body?

450
00:18:29.674 --> 00:18:34.674
And not only in our family lineage, but also, you know,

451
00:18:35.003 --> 00:18:39.428
in the parallel dimension from our past lives.

452
00:18:39.428 --> 00:18:40.100
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

453
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.828
<v ->So there is horizontal--</v>

454
00:18:41.828 --> 00:18:42.380
<v Regina>Huge part.</v>

455
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.196
<v ->and vertical part.</v>

456
00:18:43.196 --> 00:18:43.916
<v Regina>Exactly.</v>

457
00:18:43.916 --> 00:18:45.705
<v ->That we don't start,</v>

458
00:18:46.736 --> 00:18:50.135
with this, you know, pregnancy.

459
00:18:50.135 --> 00:18:51.071
<v Regina>And they're,</v>

460
00:18:51.071 --> 00:18:52.991
just like the intersection of the

461
00:18:52.991 --> 00:18:54.797
horizontal and the vertical,

462
00:18:54.797 --> 00:18:56.759
they're inextricably intertwined.

463
00:18:56.759 --> 00:18:58.219
The choice of that--

464
00:18:58.219 --> 00:18:58.559
<v ->Right.</v>

465
00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:00.119
<v Regina>bloodline, that DNA line.</v>

466
00:19:00.119 --> 00:19:00.791
<v ->Right.</v>

467
00:19:00.791 --> 00:19:02.375
<v Regina>The emotional connections of the past</v>

468
00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:03.815
and past lives, it's so complicated.

469
00:19:03.815 --> 00:19:04.295
<v ->Absolutely, absolutely.</v>

470
00:19:04.295 --> 00:19:05.567
<v Regina>So complex.</v>

471
00:19:05.567 --> 00:19:06.815
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

472
00:19:08.735 --> 00:19:10.660
The good news is,

473
00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.983
that all that complexity

474
00:19:13.496 --> 00:19:17.212
could be perceived from, the point is,

475
00:19:17.212 --> 00:19:19.343
whatever happened happened.

476
00:19:20.748 --> 00:19:24.421
Now, all we need to do is actually work with,

477
00:19:25.189 --> 00:19:26.796
not with what happened.

478
00:19:26.796 --> 00:19:27.396
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

479
00:19:27.396 --> 00:19:29.316
<v ->But how it is still holding us.</v>

480
00:19:30.246 --> 00:19:32.767
<v Regina>And this is what you worked with, he showed you--</v>

481
00:19:32.767 --> 00:19:33.121
<v ->Right.</v>

482
00:19:33.121 --> 00:19:35.473
<v Regina>or he, passed on to you, his understanding.</v>

483
00:19:35.473 --> 00:19:36.241
<v ->Yeah.</v>

484
00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:38.752
<v Regina>And, is that something you can go into?</v>

485
00:19:38.987 --> 00:19:42.479
Or is it something that's really so broad, it's more part of

486
00:19:42.479 --> 00:19:44.987
a course, you know, that people come to for--

487
00:19:44.987 --> 00:19:46.491
<v ->Right, it is part of the course.</v>

488
00:19:46.491 --> 00:19:47.113
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

489
00:19:47.113 --> 00:19:51.169
<v ->The thing that I can sort of</v>

490
00:19:51.169 --> 00:19:54.025
offer right now, is that,

491
00:19:54.025 --> 00:19:57.025
I don't do what he does,

492
00:19:57.025 --> 00:19:57.577
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

493
00:19:57.577 --> 00:19:58.849
<v ->because I'm not him.</v>

494
00:19:58.849 --> 00:19:59.425
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

495
00:19:59.425 --> 00:20:03.433
<v ->So, over the years, I developed my own way of</v>

496
00:20:03.433 --> 00:20:04.661
working with it,

497
00:20:04.951 --> 00:20:09.951
and it's just the piece of understanding

498
00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:12.961
how it all works and how it's all connected

499
00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:15.361
that's the basic gift.

500
00:20:15.361 --> 00:20:15.913
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

501
00:20:15.913 --> 00:20:18.721
<v ->And of course, there is some direct transmission,</v>

502
00:20:18.721 --> 00:20:20.641
because I worked closely with him.

503
00:20:20.641 --> 00:20:23.353
Basically, I was his right hand

504
00:20:23.353 --> 00:20:25.033
for a few years.

505
00:20:26.213 --> 00:20:28.656
And couldn't help it,

506
00:20:28.656 --> 00:20:32.010
but (laughs) get a lot of--

507
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:32.776
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

508
00:20:32.776 --> 00:20:35.982
<v ->pieces from that, but, basically,</v>

509
00:20:37.719 --> 00:20:41.256
what I do is, create a space

510
00:20:41.256 --> 00:20:44.022
for people to come in, and,

511
00:20:44.022 --> 00:20:46.424
I call that space the Birthing Field.

512
00:20:46.622 --> 00:20:48.212
So, I work with groups.

513
00:20:48.212 --> 00:20:50.912
I don't work with individuals.

514
00:20:50.912 --> 00:20:53.408
So when a group comes together,

515
00:20:53.408 --> 00:20:58.064
and we just start calling forth that

516
00:20:58.496 --> 00:21:00.632
vortex of energy that is

517
00:21:02.236 --> 00:21:05.317
spiraling the-- any birthing field.

518
00:21:05.494 --> 00:21:07.462
This is the thing, the birthing field

519
00:21:07.462 --> 00:21:11.725
is that powerful spiraling stream of energy.

520
00:21:12.278 --> 00:21:15.502
And um, create, um,

521
00:21:16.517 --> 00:21:18.719
create this group dynamic that,

522
00:21:18.719 --> 00:21:22.200
allows each individual in the group go,

523
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.072
right where they need to go.

524
00:21:24.072 --> 00:21:25.536
And that would be a different place,

525
00:21:25.536 --> 00:21:27.312
because they come from a different place,

526
00:21:27.312 --> 00:21:28.166
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

527
00:21:28.166 --> 00:21:29.951
<v ->with different kind of,</v>

528
00:21:30.474 --> 00:21:32.255
degree of, um,

529
00:21:32.628 --> 00:21:33.480
<v Regina>Trauma?</v>

530
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.688
<v ->trauma, with different level of their</v>

531
00:21:35.688 --> 00:21:37.728
own personal evolution, so,

532
00:21:37.728 --> 00:21:39.303
it's not up to me,

533
00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.856
to do something for them.

534
00:21:42.246 --> 00:21:44.472
It's their journey,

535
00:21:44.472 --> 00:21:46.128
so I'm just holding the space,

536
00:21:46.128 --> 00:21:47.712
for them to have their journey.

537
00:21:47.712 --> 00:21:48.720
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

538
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:50.184
Now,

539
00:21:51.014 --> 00:21:53.096
when we go into more the,

540
00:21:53.481 --> 00:21:56.168
are you, mostly,

541
00:21:57.756 --> 00:22:00.382
are you mostly suggesting that

542
00:22:00.382 --> 00:22:02.902
waterbirth is the way for people to go?

543
00:22:03.502 --> 00:22:05.158
Or is that--

544
00:22:05.948 --> 00:22:07.822
Let me start that again. (laughs)

545
00:22:08.952 --> 00:22:11.081
So after all these years of experience,

546
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:13.877
are you suggesting, then, that water birth would,

547
00:22:14.207 --> 00:22:15.209
for example,

548
00:22:15.519 --> 00:22:19.265
be the best avenue for all of us to be birthed through?

549
00:22:19.725 --> 00:22:20.584
<v ->No.</v>

550
00:22:20.584 --> 00:22:21.640
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

551
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.288
<v ->No, I absolutely do not promote or recommend</v>

552
00:22:25.288 --> 00:22:28.831
any particular kind of delivery.

553
00:22:29.486 --> 00:22:34.437
Water can be very helpful for a lot of women and babies,

554
00:22:34.437 --> 00:22:36.885
and it just, you know, anybody could--

555
00:22:38.005 --> 00:22:41.422
who likes taking a bath, would benefit from--

556
00:22:41.422 --> 00:22:41.926
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

557
00:22:41.926 --> 00:22:44.740
<v ->spending that time in a bath.</v>

558
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.746
But some babies are not water babies, and so--

559
00:22:47.746 --> 00:22:48.992
<v Regina>Okay, let's talk about that.</v>

560
00:22:48.992 --> 00:22:52.352
How do you know what is appropriate in that sense?

561
00:22:52.352 --> 00:22:55.040
How does the mother know whether this is a water baby,

562
00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.192
or not a water baby?

563
00:22:56.192 --> 00:22:56.750
<v ->Right.</v>

564
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.496
<v Regina>Would this be astrologically-based, or-- (laughs)</v>

565
00:22:59.746 --> 00:23:01.232
<v ->Yeah, I wouldn't know.</v>

566
00:23:01.232 --> 00:23:01.794
<v Regina>Right.</v>

567
00:23:01.794 --> 00:23:02.554
<v ->The baby would tell.</v>

568
00:23:02.554 --> 00:23:03.284
<v Regina>The bab-- mmhmm.</v>

569
00:23:03.284 --> 00:23:04.976
<v ->See, that's the whole point,</v>

570
00:23:05.496 --> 00:23:09.440
to develop such relationship with the baby,

571
00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.048
during pregnancy,

572
00:23:11.048 --> 00:23:14.480
that the baby will very clearly communicate

573
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.258
what kind of birth they want,

574
00:23:17.258 --> 00:23:19.344
whether it's in the water, or,

575
00:23:19.418 --> 00:23:22.464
in the forest in a cave,

576
00:23:22.682 --> 00:23:24.602
or in the bedroom in the quiet,

577
00:23:24.602 --> 00:23:27.014
with candles and soft music,

578
00:23:27.014 --> 00:23:28.769
or on a high mountain,

579
00:23:28.874 --> 00:23:31.265
or having a C-section.

580
00:23:31.442 --> 00:23:33.602
That's a possibility, too, that,

581
00:23:33.602 --> 00:23:36.506
that particular baby, you know,

582
00:23:36.506 --> 00:23:39.194
whatever their sole agenda is,

583
00:23:39.194 --> 00:23:41.042
that brings them here.

584
00:23:41.042 --> 00:23:44.368
Maybe they require a C-section in order to

585
00:23:45.948 --> 00:23:48.703
work with the set of circumstances.

586
00:23:48.703 --> 00:23:51.871
So, but I-- what I am promoting,

587
00:23:51.871 --> 00:23:55.999
is consciousness, in the process of

588
00:23:55.999 --> 00:23:57.944
creating the new person.

589
00:23:58.473 --> 00:24:00.392
Consciousness in the birth,

590
00:24:00.392 --> 00:24:02.216
consciousness in conception,

591
00:24:02.216 --> 00:24:04.424
in breastfeeding,

592
00:24:05.006 --> 00:24:07.253
and connecting with that child,

593
00:24:07.253 --> 00:24:11.624
so the child feels loved and tended to.

594
00:24:11.837 --> 00:24:14.648
So the mother would know what this baby needs.

595
00:24:15.515 --> 00:24:18.005
<v Regina>Let's talk about that, and,</v>

596
00:24:18.498 --> 00:24:22.620
just as a little aside from my own experience.

597
00:24:23.985 --> 00:24:26.882
I was told at a very young age I would never have children.

598
00:24:26.882 --> 00:24:29.186
Impossible, for my body to have children.

599
00:24:29.186 --> 00:24:31.538
However, I had dreams for about a dozen years,

600
00:24:31.538 --> 00:24:34.946
of this perfect little son, whom,

601
00:24:34.946 --> 00:24:37.518
as years have gone on, and I understand how the

602
00:24:37.518 --> 00:24:38.810
realms work much better,

603
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.967
I understand this being was working with me.

604
00:24:40.967 --> 00:24:42.431
The one who was to become my son

605
00:24:42.431 --> 00:24:43.991
was working with me from the other side,

606
00:24:43.991 --> 00:24:45.143
for many years--

607
00:24:45.143 --> 00:24:45.695
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

608
00:24:45.695 --> 00:24:49.871
<v Regina>right up to the moment of his own birth.</v>

609
00:24:50.245 --> 00:24:52.055
And I believe was instrumental

610
00:24:52.055 --> 00:24:54.119
in getting his father and I together, even,

611
00:24:54.119 --> 00:24:55.523
for a very specific purpose.

612
00:24:55.523 --> 00:24:56.087
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

613
00:24:56.087 --> 00:24:56.783
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

614
00:24:56.783 --> 00:24:57.479
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

615
00:24:57.479 --> 00:24:59.463
<v Regina>And, when the time came,</v>

616
00:24:59.463 --> 00:25:01.223
his only way to make it into the world

617
00:25:01.223 --> 00:25:03.343
was through a Cesarean Section.

618
00:25:03.725 --> 00:25:05.639
And, we had no choice.

619
00:25:05.639 --> 00:25:08.423
We'd both die, or he comes in this way.

620
00:25:08.423 --> 00:25:09.719
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

621
00:25:09.719 --> 00:25:12.527
<v Regina>And so, for a being that co--</v>

622
00:25:12.527 --> 00:25:15.191
it's not as though we have to feel as though

623
00:25:15.191 --> 00:25:16.919
we've robbed our child of something

624
00:25:16.919 --> 00:25:19.513
because we've chosen a certain way,

625
00:25:19.513 --> 00:25:21.743
or not-- in this case, not chosen a way

626
00:25:21.743 --> 00:25:22.513
for them to come in,

627
00:25:22.513 --> 00:25:24.311
because a soul is very resilient.

628
00:25:24.311 --> 00:25:25.055
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

629
00:25:25.055 --> 00:25:26.396
<v Regina>On the other hand,</v>

630
00:25:27.489 --> 00:25:31.013
being able to connect with that being consciously,

631
00:25:31.013 --> 00:25:32.069
prior to birth--

632
00:25:32.069 --> 00:25:33.039
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

633
00:25:33.039 --> 00:25:37.507
<v Regina>seems to me, to be a huge part of the journey</v>

634
00:25:37.507 --> 00:25:37.973
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

635
00:25:37.973 --> 00:25:39.029
<v Regina>of parenthood.</v>

636
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.605
<v ->Yeah.</v>

637
00:25:39.605 --> 00:25:41.093
<v Regina>Far before the body comes in.</v>

638
00:25:41.093 --> 00:25:41.597
<v ->Yeah.</v>

639
00:25:41.597 --> 00:25:42.893
<v Regina>And I used to talk to babies,</v>

640
00:25:42.893 --> 00:25:44.645
for my friends and sister,

641
00:25:44.645 --> 00:25:45.869
before the baby was born,

642
00:25:45.869 --> 00:25:47.761
within that one week window, I could--

643
00:25:47.761 --> 00:25:49.685
they would share with me what they were coming for,

644
00:25:49.685 --> 00:25:50.621
and so forth, I would,

645
00:25:50.621 --> 00:25:52.775
take notes in a meditation and then

646
00:25:52.775 --> 00:25:54.261
pass that to the parents,

647
00:25:54.261 --> 00:25:54.725
<v ->Yeah.</v>

648
00:25:54.725 --> 00:25:56.291
<v Regina>if they couldn't connect themselves.</v>

649
00:25:56.771 --> 00:25:57.749
But the reality is,

650
00:25:57.749 --> 00:26:00.605
we can all connect ourselves, can't we?

651
00:26:02.255 --> 00:26:03.845
<v ->Yeah, absolutely, and uh--</v>

652
00:26:03.845 --> 00:26:05.693
<v Regina>So let's talk about that part of how you</v>

653
00:26:05.693 --> 00:26:07.637
encourage people and help them.

654
00:26:08.467 --> 00:26:10.215
<v ->To connect with the baby? (laughs)</v>

655
00:26:10.403 --> 00:26:12.155
<v Regina>To connect with the whole field,</v>

656
00:26:12.155 --> 00:26:13.955
the conscious aspect of the birth,

657
00:26:13.955 --> 00:26:15.769
and learning to listen to the baby.

658
00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:16.525
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

659
00:26:16.525 --> 00:26:20.177
Well, the number one step is connect with yourself.

660
00:26:20.751 --> 00:26:25.687
So, emotional presence in the body is what needs to

661
00:26:27.227 --> 00:26:32.227
be developed or enforced or, created from scratch because,

662
00:26:32.575 --> 00:26:34.567
of our own birth trauma,

663
00:26:34.567 --> 00:26:38.503
most of us are not emotionally present in the body.

664
00:26:38.993 --> 00:26:43.993
And it's very different kind of quality of presence,

665
00:26:44.027 --> 00:26:46.341
than, for example, physical strength.

666
00:26:48.231 --> 00:26:51.773
I know a lot of very fit, very

667
00:26:52.733 --> 00:26:56.005
strong, you know, in great shape people, who are,

668
00:26:56.005 --> 00:26:58.771
completely emotionally checked out.

669
00:26:58.844 --> 00:27:00.116
They're clever.

670
00:27:00.116 --> 00:27:01.172
They're very--

671
00:27:01.172 --> 00:27:02.180
<v Regina>Their mind's functioning, yeah.</v>

672
00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.762
<v ->Yeah, the mind is functioning.</v>

673
00:27:03.762 --> 00:27:06.188
The cognitive function, you know.

674
00:27:06.188 --> 00:27:07.905
They can do business.

675
00:27:07.905 --> 00:27:09.417
They have good memory,

676
00:27:09.417 --> 00:27:12.777
and they're in beautiful physical shape,

677
00:27:12.777 --> 00:27:13.905
and they eat right,

678
00:27:13.905 --> 00:27:15.417
and they do yoga day and night.

679
00:27:15.417 --> 00:27:17.121
And at the same time,

680
00:27:17.921 --> 00:27:20.460
full of self-loathing, and,

681
00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:25.094
sort of, mistrust, and,

682
00:27:25.249 --> 00:27:28.443
inability to just relax and enjoy

683
00:27:28.443 --> 00:27:29.925
having that beautiful body.

684
00:27:30.755 --> 00:27:31.155
<v ->So this is--</v>

685
00:27:31.155 --> 00:27:31.443
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

686
00:27:32.235 --> 00:27:33.043
<v Regina>That's true.</v>

687
00:27:33.043 --> 00:27:34.491
<v ->This exact piece is missing,</v>

688
00:27:34.491 --> 00:27:38.032
the emotional presence in the body that,

689
00:27:38.255 --> 00:27:41.667
basically has another name of

690
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.011
loving yourself, and,

691
00:27:47.257 --> 00:27:51.361
just being deeply relaxed about being who you truly are.

692
00:27:51.361 --> 00:27:54.169
And for that, you need to know who you truly are.

693
00:27:54.169 --> 00:27:59.169
And that mechanism of not being in the body,

694
00:27:59.305 --> 00:28:03.769
is actually very simple function of our brain.

695
00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:06.505
When we are experiencing some

696
00:28:06.505 --> 00:28:10.801
emotional sensory overload--

697
00:28:10.801 --> 00:28:12.097
doesn't have to be emotional,

698
00:28:12.097 --> 00:28:15.601
it could be just a physiological threat--

699
00:28:15.601 --> 00:28:16.225
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

700
00:28:16.225 --> 00:28:17.353
<v ->Um, we check out.</v>

701
00:28:17.353 --> 00:28:18.409
<v Regina>Mmhmm, we do.</v>

702
00:28:18.409 --> 00:28:21.577
<v ->That's why lots of children don't remember the abuse.</v>

703
00:28:21.577 --> 00:28:24.713
That's why lots of victims of some horrifying

704
00:28:25.521 --> 00:28:26.602
rape or crime--

705
00:28:26.602 --> 00:28:27.946
<v Regina>It's a survival mechanism, sure.</v>

706
00:28:27.946 --> 00:28:28.714
<v ->They don't remember that.</v>

707
00:28:28.714 --> 00:28:31.750
And, if you would watch,

708
00:28:33.486 --> 00:28:38.244
a scene of hunt in the wildlife, on some Discovery channel,

709
00:28:38.244 --> 00:28:39.588
you would notice that,

710
00:28:39.588 --> 00:28:42.372
the moment the lion catches the gazelle,

711
00:28:42.372 --> 00:28:43.331
she goes,

712
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:45.228
you know, goes completely--

713
00:28:45.228 --> 00:28:46.258
<v Regina>Just like we do when it's our death.</v>

714
00:28:46.258 --> 00:28:46.970
<v ->Right.</v>

715
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.766
And she is still alive, right?

716
00:28:48.766 --> 00:28:49.258
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

717
00:28:49.258 --> 00:28:51.084
<v ->You can see her eyes are blinking,</v>

718
00:28:51.084 --> 00:28:52.716
and that she is still breathing,

719
00:28:52.716 --> 00:28:53.220
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

720
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.828
<v ->but she's not there.</v>

721
00:28:54.828 --> 00:28:55.380
<v Regina>No.</v>

722
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.280
<v ->Because nature assures that</v>

723
00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:02.482
we are not witnessing our body being

724
00:29:02.482 --> 00:29:03.588
torn to pieces--

725
00:29:03.588 --> 00:29:04.020
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

726
00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:05.244
<v ->you know, it's not nice.</v>

727
00:29:05.244 --> 00:29:07.764
So, this is what happens, that,

728
00:29:07.764 --> 00:29:09.684
that mechanism of checking out,

729
00:29:13.504 --> 00:29:17.836
is helping us not to deal with that sensory overload.

730
00:29:17.836 --> 00:29:20.812
But then, that which checked out,

731
00:29:20.812 --> 00:29:23.379
needs to be sort of, invited back.

732
00:29:24.744 --> 00:29:26.561
<v Regina>And, are you saying that many of us</v>

733
00:29:27.231 --> 00:29:29.850
checked out upon our entry into the world

734
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:31.146
through our own births?

735
00:29:31.966 --> 00:29:34.025
<v ->That is exactly what I'm saying, that,</v>

736
00:29:34.025 --> 00:29:34.913
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

737
00:29:34.913 --> 00:29:38.777
<v ->that when the delivery is too harsh,</v>

738
00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:41.010
for the baby's sensory apparatus,

739
00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:41.777
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

740
00:29:42.237 --> 00:29:44.729
<v ->They just check out, and,</v>

741
00:29:44.729 --> 00:29:47.705
then they don't know how to find their way back in.

742
00:29:48.275 --> 00:29:53.009
There is even a saying in English, that indicates that, um,

743
00:29:53.219 --> 00:29:54.749
"You scared the life out of me."

744
00:29:55.229 --> 00:29:55.721
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

745
00:29:55.721 --> 00:30:00.137
<v ->So what is it, that gets scared out?</v>

746
00:30:00.487 --> 00:30:01.241
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

747
00:30:01.741 --> 00:30:05.417
<v ->I believe that it's that connection with the soul,</v>

748
00:30:05.417 --> 00:30:07.385
that basically gets interrupted,

749
00:30:07.385 --> 00:30:10.947
and then the body is just dangling around, and,

750
00:30:13.889 --> 00:30:16.925
without a host.

751
00:30:17.705 --> 00:30:18.569
<v Regina>In a sense, yes,</v>

752
00:30:18.569 --> 00:30:21.859
or without it's, it's own spirit intact.

753
00:30:21.859 --> 00:30:22.265
<v ->Right.</v>

754
00:30:22.265 --> 00:30:24.209
<v Regina>And living through the physical.</v>

755
00:30:24.209 --> 00:30:26.743
<v ->Right. Right, yeah.</v>

756
00:30:26.743 --> 00:30:30.389
<v Regina>So, we understand some of what happens</v>

757
00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:32.525
in the trauma, which sounds--

758
00:30:33.225 --> 00:30:34.733
your description of what happened,

759
00:30:35.903 --> 00:30:39.939
in Russia, in the past, in the birthing centers,

760
00:30:39.939 --> 00:30:43.059
certainly exemplifies a very harsh reality.

761
00:30:43.059 --> 00:30:44.379
Now let's talk about

762
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:47.739
what a reality could look like, and does look like,

763
00:30:48.069 --> 00:30:50.792
in the work you do, and with the people you work with.

764
00:30:51.699 --> 00:30:56.168
<v ->Well, that reality is very beautiful. (laughs)</v>

765
00:30:56.691 --> 00:30:58.275
It's very beautiful.

766
00:30:58.275 --> 00:31:03.171
It's, first of all, the full program,

767
00:31:03.171 --> 00:31:05.163
includes conscious conception,

768
00:31:05.163 --> 00:31:09.075
which is a very deliberate connection

769
00:31:09.075 --> 00:31:11.547
with the spirit of the unborn child,

770
00:31:11.547 --> 00:31:16.547
and communion in the choice of

771
00:31:16.731 --> 00:31:20.528
how this baby to be born, when, where?

772
00:31:21.525 --> 00:31:23.737
Who is the other parent, (laughs) you know.

773
00:31:23.737 --> 00:31:24.492
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

774
00:31:24.492 --> 00:31:25.606
<v ->Who is the father?</v>

775
00:31:25.606 --> 00:31:26.503
Because that baby has a--

776
00:31:26.503 --> 00:31:28.421
<v Regina>So a woman can begin this before she</v>

777
00:31:28.421 --> 00:31:29.405
even has her mate.

778
00:31:29.405 --> 00:31:29.981
<v ->Yeah.</v>

779
00:31:29.981 --> 00:31:31.525
<v Regina>It's a process of life.</v>

780
00:31:31.525 --> 00:31:32.237
<v Elena>Yeah.</v>
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

781
00:31:32.237 --> 00:31:37.237
<v ->And even neuro-biology, basically, of the physiology,</v>

782
00:31:40.981 --> 00:31:43.820
the birth of the baby starts about

783
00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.796
two, three months, prior to conception, because,

784
00:31:46.796 --> 00:31:51.796
whatever the parents are doing, eating, not doing,

785
00:31:52.992 --> 00:31:55.373
thinking, you know, all of that,

786
00:31:55.373 --> 00:31:59.393
basically defines the quality of the sperm and the egg--

787
00:31:59.393 --> 00:31:59.693
<v Regina>Right.</v>

788
00:31:59.693 --> 00:32:01.949
<v ->that will meet at some point, and,</v>

789
00:32:03.709 --> 00:32:05.481
start creating that body.

790
00:32:05.481 --> 00:32:06.303
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

791
00:32:06.303 --> 00:32:09.876
<v ->So, the summary of it is,</v>

792
00:32:09.876 --> 00:32:11.504
it's not a moment too soon. (laughs)

793
00:32:11.504 --> 00:32:12.348
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

794
00:32:12.348 --> 00:32:15.437
<v ->If a couple is thinking about bringing a baby,</v>

795
00:32:15.437 --> 00:32:17.261
it's not a moment too soon.

796
00:32:17.261 --> 00:32:20.501
And by the time it's a week before giving birth,

797
00:32:20.971 --> 00:32:23.287
a lot of things are too late.

798
00:32:23.991 --> 00:32:25.903
We really need to

799
00:32:26.505 --> 00:32:27.693
bring it to schools.

800
00:32:28.253 --> 00:32:30.373
That's where it needs to start.

801
00:32:30.503 --> 00:32:35.503
The young girls, young boys, in their early teens,

802
00:32:35.606 --> 00:32:37.814
need to understand the responsibility,

803
00:32:37.814 --> 00:32:41.582
and the implications of that future decision

804
00:32:41.582 --> 00:32:42.998
they will have to make.

805
00:32:42.998 --> 00:32:47.270
And, statistically, in the U.S.,

806
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:51.703
by the time a young woman is pregnant with her first baby,

807
00:32:51.703 --> 00:32:56.204
she is exposed to over 100 horrifying, bloody,

808
00:32:56.501 --> 00:32:58.762
terrible scenes of births.

809
00:32:59.722 --> 00:33:04.478
So, basically, we're conditioning our young women

810
00:33:04.478 --> 00:33:05.995
to be scared of birth from the start.

811
00:33:05.995 --> 00:33:07.115
<v Regina>Well, yes.</v>

812
00:33:07.115 --> 00:33:09.755
And certainly Hollywood is one of the greatest culprits.

813
00:33:09.755 --> 00:33:11.699
Having women screaming, and

814
00:33:11.699 --> 00:33:12.515
<v ->Yeah.</v>

815
00:33:12.515 --> 00:33:13.787
<v Regina>saying, "I hate you," to her husband--</v>

816
00:33:13.787 --> 00:33:14.627
<v ->Right.</v>

817
00:33:14.627 --> 00:33:15.587
<v Regina>for doing this to her, and</v>

818
00:33:15.587 --> 00:33:16.355
<v ->Or looking stupid and ugly.</v>

819
00:33:16.355 --> 00:33:17.819
<v Regina>tearing-- oh, yes, all of the--</v>

820
00:33:17.819 --> 00:33:19.685
<v ->And, it, but especially,</v>

821
00:33:20.235 --> 00:33:24.432
the footage of the birth that they choose to show

822
00:33:24.432 --> 00:33:27.120
in 8th, 7th grade in Sex Ed class.

823
00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.320
<v Regina>Oh, yes, we've all seen that, yeah.</v>

824
00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:28.900
<v ->Yeah.</v>

825
00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.766
The-- what they're showing nowadays,

826
00:33:30.766 --> 00:33:33.467
girls are running out to puke in the bathroom

827
00:33:33.467 --> 00:33:34.307
when they see--

828
00:33:34.307 --> 00:33:35.041
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

829
00:33:35.525 --> 00:33:36.875
<v ->what's happening to women.</v>

830
00:33:36.875 --> 00:33:37.619
They choose--

831
00:33:37.619 --> 00:33:39.179
<v Regina>It's very painful for a girl to watch.</v>

832
00:33:39.179 --> 00:33:40.355
<v ->Right, and--</v>

833
00:33:40.355 --> 00:33:41.459
<v Regina>I can't imagine what it's like</v>

834
00:33:41.459 --> 00:33:42.491
for the boys to watch.

835
00:33:42.491 --> 00:33:44.411
<v ->And they're so impressionable.</v>

836
00:33:44.411 --> 00:33:45.511
They're so--

837
00:33:45.511 --> 00:33:47.963
they don't even have any other reference point,

838
00:33:47.963 --> 00:33:51.299
because everything they hear about it,

839
00:33:51.299 --> 00:33:55.139
from older sisters, from aunties, from the mother,

840
00:33:55.749 --> 00:33:59.714
supports that image of birth being absolutely

841
00:34:00.714 --> 00:34:03.287
unbearable and torturous.

842
00:34:03.287 --> 00:34:05.066
And, that's not the truth.

843
00:34:05.066 --> 00:34:05.927
<v Regina>No, and that's--</v>

844
00:34:05.927 --> 00:34:06.983
<v ->That's not the truth. (laughs)</v>

845
00:34:06.983 --> 00:34:09.503
<v Regina>When I was in that situation, of the trauma,</v>

846
00:34:09.503 --> 00:34:12.249
before my son was taken out of me,

847
00:34:12.249 --> 00:34:15.527
I went into a state of hypnosis, spontaneously,

848
00:34:15.527 --> 00:34:18.319
and it was in maximum contractions and labor.

849
00:34:18.319 --> 00:34:18.945
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

850
00:34:18.945 --> 00:34:19.501
<v Regina>It was beautiful.</v>

851
00:34:19.501 --> 00:34:22.247
I just felt like ocean waves running through my body.

852
00:34:22.247 --> 00:34:23.903
I felt no pain. None.

853
00:34:23.903 --> 00:34:25.223
<v ->That's exactly what it is.</v>

854
00:34:25.223 --> 00:34:28.166
The female body produces

855
00:34:28.506 --> 00:34:33.503
floods of oxytocin, which is the, "feel good" hormone.

856
00:34:33.503 --> 00:34:34.364
<v Regina>Yeah, it's great.</v>

857
00:34:34.364 --> 00:34:35.420
<v ->It's dopamine.</v>

858
00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:38.609
And the amount that is produced at birth,

859
00:34:38.956 --> 00:34:42.572
is basically, multiply any amount,

860
00:34:42.572 --> 00:34:44.348
that orgasmic sensation,

861
00:34:44.348 --> 00:34:44.900
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

862
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.944
<v ->in sexual experience are,</v>

863
00:34:46.944 --> 00:34:47.998
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

864
00:34:47.998 --> 00:34:49.124
<v ->being produced.</v>

865
00:34:49.124 --> 00:34:54.092
So basically, ecstasy and bliss and orgasm,

866
00:34:54.092 --> 00:34:57.236
in the-- during birth, is the norm.

867
00:34:57.236 --> 00:35:00.020
Physiologically, that's what's supposed to happen.

868
00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.532
<v Regina>But if you're conditioned to believe</v>

869
00:35:01.532 --> 00:35:02.512
you're going to be--

870
00:35:02.512 --> 00:35:02.980
<v ->Right.</v>

871
00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.466
<v Regina>screaming and sweating, and--</v>

872
00:35:04.466 --> 00:35:05.096
<v ->Right.</v>

873
00:35:05.096 --> 00:35:06.264
<v Regina>just wretching through the whole thing.</v>

874
00:35:06.264 --> 00:35:08.280
<v ->Exactly, that's the thing, that,</v>

875
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.220
our brain chemistry either produces

876
00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.064
dopamines or stress hormones.

877
00:35:13.064 --> 00:35:13.734
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

878
00:35:13.734 --> 00:35:15.274
It cannot do both.

879
00:35:15.274 --> 00:35:18.882
So if it is producing all the adrenaline,

880
00:35:18.882 --> 00:35:21.141
it can not produce oxytocin.

881
00:35:21.141 --> 00:35:22.878
And the thing is that,

882
00:35:22.878 --> 00:35:26.185
when we are, just, you know,

883
00:35:26.185 --> 00:35:30.075
a split second of production of any kind of adrenalines,

884
00:35:30.777 --> 00:35:32.187
our cervix locks.

885
00:35:33.244 --> 00:35:35.469
<v Regina>And the women in these hospitals</v>

886
00:35:35.469 --> 00:35:35.781
<v ->Right.</v>

887
00:35:35.781 --> 00:35:36.751
<v Regina>are running on adrenaline.</v>

888
00:35:36.751 --> 00:35:37.327
<v ->Exactly.</v>

889
00:35:37.327 --> 00:35:38.071
<v Regina>And fear.</v>

890
00:35:38.071 --> 00:35:38.767
<v ->Exactly.</v>

891
00:35:38.767 --> 00:35:40.447
That's what happens, because,

892
00:35:40.447 --> 00:35:45.447
that is, again, the very wise, merciful, mechanism

893
00:35:45.737 --> 00:35:49.035
of protecting the species.

894
00:35:49.249 --> 00:35:52.543
Because, imagine that you're there, in the bushes somewhere,

895
00:35:52.543 --> 00:35:54.067
trying to give birth,

896
00:35:54.067 --> 00:35:58.231
and you hear the sound or scent of a predator.

897
00:35:58.231 --> 00:36:00.605
You need to be able to run for your life.

898
00:36:00.839 --> 00:36:01.135
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

899
00:36:01.135 --> 00:36:02.599
<v ->And not drop the baby, right?</v>

900
00:36:02.599 --> 00:36:03.343
<v Regina>Right.</v>

901
00:36:03.343 --> 00:36:06.127
<v ->So that's the mechanism that the cervix just</v>

902
00:36:06.127 --> 00:36:07.853
closes completely.

903
00:36:08.969 --> 00:36:12.502
What needs to happen, if she manages to run away,

904
00:36:13.019 --> 00:36:17.846
within 30, 40 minutes, the oxytocin takes over,

905
00:36:18.227 --> 00:36:20.063
and cervix relaxes,

906
00:36:20.511 --> 00:36:22.820
and within an hour, it opens.

907
00:36:23.453 --> 00:36:23.963
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

908
00:36:24.991 --> 00:36:25.541
<v ->But, when you're--</v>

909
00:36:25.541 --> 00:36:26.499
<v Regina>But when you're lying in the hospital</v>

910
00:36:26.499 --> 00:36:27.499
on your back--

911
00:36:27.499 --> 00:36:28.465
<v ->Right. Right.</v>

912
00:36:28.465 --> 00:36:30.991
And the nurse comes in and starts asking you,

913
00:36:31.211 --> 00:36:33.240
"What is your social security number?"

914
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:33.518
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

915
00:36:33.518 --> 00:36:37.290
<v ->Or, comes with a needle, and,</v>

916
00:36:38.054 --> 00:36:39.974
"Well, this will make you feel better."

917
00:36:40.254 --> 00:36:43.526
It's really, very little option,

918
00:36:43.526 --> 00:36:45.878
that there is just some space to relax,

919
00:36:45.878 --> 00:36:50.006
and to just drop into that oxytocin production mode,

920
00:36:50.006 --> 00:36:52.002
when there is all the strangers coming in,

921
00:36:52.002 --> 00:36:53.534
and doing stuff to you.

922
00:36:53.534 --> 00:36:56.057
And the smells and the sounds of the hospital.

923
00:36:56.057 --> 00:36:56.822
<v Regina>And you're cold.</v>

924
00:36:56.822 --> 00:36:58.310
Usually you're cold in a little gown.

925
00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:00.812
<v ->You're cold, and you're uncomfortable, and--</v>

926
00:37:01.742 --> 00:37:02.270
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

927
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:04.358
<v ->It's very disorienting.</v>

928
00:37:04.358 --> 00:37:07.968
It's really, really difficult to get to that, you know--

929
00:37:08.498 --> 00:37:10.498
Cut the rest of the world and

930
00:37:10.498 --> 00:37:12.730
come back to your oxytocin production.

931
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:16.606
But that's exactly what will open the cervix.

932
00:37:17.245 --> 00:37:20.748
So, if that's not happening, then we need a

933
00:37:20.748 --> 00:37:24.204
a sharp metal object, to open that cervix.

934
00:37:25.254 --> 00:37:26.217
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

935
00:37:26.997 --> 00:37:29.784
And, the trauma begins,

936
00:37:29.784 --> 00:37:31.392
or the trauma has already begun,

937
00:37:31.392 --> 00:37:31.992
<v ->Yeah.</v>

938
00:37:31.992 --> 00:37:33.168
<v Regina>because the mother's in fear.</v>

939
00:37:33.168 --> 00:37:34.872
The baby is getting all those chemicals

940
00:37:34.872 --> 00:37:36.712
through their own system, as a result of that.

941
00:37:36.712 --> 00:37:37.943
<v ->Right, that's the thing,</v>

942
00:37:37.943 --> 00:37:39.925
that placenta does not filter

943
00:37:40.195 --> 00:37:42.197
a majority of the drug.

944
00:37:42.197 --> 00:37:42.725
<v Regina>Right.</v>

945
00:37:42.725 --> 00:37:45.917
<v ->And, it goes into baby's nervous system,</v>

946
00:37:45.917 --> 00:37:49.109
and disorients the baby, and there we go.

947
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:53.462
When the drug was introduced into the delivery room,

948
00:37:53.917 --> 00:37:57.744
in the '40's, there we go.

949
00:37:57.744 --> 00:37:59.926
The drug culture of the '60's.

950
00:38:00.503 --> 00:38:02.021
They're so related.

951
00:38:02.021 --> 00:38:05.358
They're-- basically, one is the direct result of the other.

952
00:38:06.033 --> 00:38:11.033
And I don't see why it's being so

953
00:38:11.156 --> 00:38:12.711
deliberately overlooked.

954
00:38:13.504 --> 00:38:14.285
<v Regina>Mmm.</v>

955
00:38:14.285 --> 00:38:16.922
<v ->The drug becomes the comfort zone.</v>

956
00:38:17.229 --> 00:38:21.472
It becomes limbic programming of the nervous system,

957
00:38:21.472 --> 00:38:23.440
that in order for us to feel good,

958
00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.980
we need to have some chemical induction.

959
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:26.944
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

960
00:38:26.944 --> 00:38:28.312
Now that makes perfect sense.

961
00:38:28.312 --> 00:38:28.967
<v ->Yeah.</v>

962
00:38:29.494 --> 00:38:30.573
<v Regina>So when you're taking--</v>

963
00:38:30.783 --> 00:38:34.249
Let's go back to, you and working with your people,

964
00:38:34.249 --> 00:38:37.368
that come to you in groups, and, you're--

965
00:38:37.368 --> 00:38:40.680
Now, let's say, you've already explained the value,

966
00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.260
and helped people understand the value of

967
00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.192
of clearing the space, and,

968
00:38:45.192 --> 00:38:47.592
what it's going to be to create the birthing field,

969
00:38:47.592 --> 00:38:49.464
and to begin connecting with the baby--

970
00:38:50.484 --> 00:38:53.563
the entity, the soul, that will become this little baby--

971
00:38:53.963 --> 00:38:58.061
prior to the birth, and begin intuiting what kind of birth

972
00:38:58.061 --> 00:39:01.539
this being is going to prefer on its arrival.

973
00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:03.998
What else happens in that period of time?

974
00:39:03.998 --> 00:39:05.750
<v ->Well, what needs to happen is,</v>

975
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:09.062
to actual manual adjustment,

976
00:39:09.062 --> 00:39:12.206
of the basic settings in the nervous system.

977
00:39:12.206 --> 00:39:15.614
Because, all that programming happens

978
00:39:15.614 --> 00:39:19.975
before the cognitive functions evolve in the cortex.

979
00:39:22.036 --> 00:39:25.081
So you can't really fix the problem,

980
00:39:25.081 --> 00:39:26.979
through cognitive process,

981
00:39:26.979 --> 00:39:28.825
through talking or thinking about it.

982
00:39:28.825 --> 00:39:30.760
You need to go to where

983
00:39:31.759 --> 00:39:34.335
the problem was created.

984
00:39:34.595 --> 00:39:36.150
<v Regina>You're talking about the parent.</v>

985
00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:37.218
<v ->Yeah.</v>

986
00:39:37.218 --> 00:39:39.280
<v Regina>The parent, in dealing with their own emotional--</v>

987
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:39.714
<v ->Yeah.</v>

988
00:39:39.714 --> 00:39:41.534
<v Regina>issues and such, that they're being to the table.</v>

989
00:39:41.534 --> 00:39:42.054
<v ->Yeah.</v>

990
00:39:42.054 --> 00:39:42.808
<v Regina>Okay.</v>

991
00:39:42.808 --> 00:39:46.188
<v ->Well, anybody who wants to alter their own basic settings.</v>

992
00:39:46.188 --> 00:39:46.864
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

993
00:39:46.864 --> 00:39:47.715
<v ->That's who I'm talking about.</v>

994
00:39:47.715 --> 00:39:48.555
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

995
00:39:48.785 --> 00:39:50.228
So what I'm saying is that

996
00:39:50.228 --> 00:39:52.194
you can't talk your way out of it.

997
00:39:52.754 --> 00:39:54.158
You need to

998
00:39:55.738 --> 00:39:59.463
tweak those basic settings in the nervous system,

999
00:39:59.463 --> 00:40:03.594
on the cellular level, on a much, sort of,

1000
00:40:05.007 --> 00:40:09.194
parallel reality, parallel world.

1001
00:40:09.194 --> 00:40:13.952
Because our limbic brain, where that imprinting happens,

1002
00:40:13.952 --> 00:40:16.318
is not connected with the cortex.

1003
00:40:16.318 --> 00:40:17.867
Again, due to that,

1004
00:40:18.958 --> 00:40:20.264
sensory overload,

1005
00:40:21.247 --> 00:40:22.891
in our formative period.

1006
00:40:23.954 --> 00:40:25.148
It divorces them.

1007
00:40:25.965 --> 00:40:27.852
Logic is in the cortex,

1008
00:40:28.274 --> 00:40:32.356
and the imprinting is in the limbic brain,

1009
00:40:32.356 --> 00:40:35.398
that governs the emotion and sensation.

1010
00:40:35.778 --> 00:40:38.769
<v Regina>So are you talking about physical manipulations?</v>

1011
00:40:41.012 --> 00:40:41.500
<v ->Well--</v>

1012
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.146
<v Regina>In working with the release? Or...</v>

1013
00:40:43.146 --> 00:40:44.654
<v ->That's the thing, that's--</v>

1014
00:40:44.654 --> 00:40:46.578
there is also a third player.

1015
00:40:46.578 --> 00:40:47.774
Reptilian brain.

1016
00:40:47.774 --> 00:40:48.216
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1017
00:40:48.216 --> 00:40:50.722
<v ->That is responsible for pure physiology.</v>

1018
00:40:50.722 --> 00:40:54.144
So, cognitive function is cortex.

1019
00:40:54.504 --> 00:40:57.582
Reptilian brain is pure physiology.

1020
00:40:58.294 --> 00:41:02.397
And limbic brain is the emotional body.

1021
00:41:03.238 --> 00:41:08.135
So, when you activate and work through

1022
00:41:08.135 --> 00:41:09.432
just one of them--

1023
00:41:09.432 --> 00:41:14.060
either talk therapy, or say through Reptilian brain.

1024
00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.764
when you try to access it through the body,

1025
00:41:16.764 --> 00:41:18.272
physical manipulation,

1026
00:41:18.272 --> 00:41:22.562
Yoga, dance, massage, Craniosacral, you know, all,

1027
00:41:23.752 --> 00:41:27.374
the work, the healing work, that addresses the body.

1028
00:41:27.733 --> 00:41:30.291
That's where it goes forever.

1029
00:41:30.504 --> 00:41:33.723
Because you either work with this one or with this one.

1030
00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:38.161
The trick is to work with them together,

1031
00:41:38.161 --> 00:41:39.339
at the same time.

1032
00:41:39.773 --> 00:41:41.671
<v Regina>And how do you work with the limbic?</v>

1033
00:41:41.971 --> 00:41:43.881
<v ->Well, yeah, that's the thing.</v>

1034
00:41:43.881 --> 00:41:46.975
Then you need to actually bring the whole team together.

1035
00:41:46.975 --> 00:41:47.599
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1036
00:41:47.599 --> 00:41:50.781
<v ->And make them in harmony.</v>

1037
00:41:50.901 --> 00:41:52.825
Make all the three voices,

1038
00:41:53.475 --> 00:41:56.231
sing in harmony, instead of in discord.

1039
00:41:56.231 --> 00:41:59.105
And that's exactly, you know,

1040
00:41:59.515 --> 00:42:01.327
that's exactly the metaphor.

1041
00:42:01.327 --> 00:42:03.537
It's all coming down to frequencies,

1042
00:42:03.537 --> 00:42:05.919
so we need to harmonize those frequencies.

1043
00:42:05.919 --> 00:42:06.781
Because,

1044
00:42:09.933 --> 00:42:12.169
most people don't have them harmonized.

1045
00:42:12.169 --> 00:42:13.053
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1046
00:42:13.053 --> 00:42:13.833
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1047
00:42:13.833 --> 00:42:16.581
So, the way I work with it,

1048
00:42:17.025 --> 00:42:19.163
I have about a dozen different

1049
00:42:20.743 --> 00:42:24.625
techniques or processes or exercises, whatever

1050
00:42:25.935 --> 00:42:27.896
word would work for them.

1051
00:42:27.896 --> 00:42:29.768
They're all very, very different.

1052
00:42:30.038 --> 00:42:34.136
But they take, on average, each one of them takes,

1053
00:42:34.136 --> 00:42:35.738
between two and three hours.

1054
00:42:36.504 --> 00:42:39.852
And they include a lot of

1055
00:42:39.852 --> 00:42:43.700
different ways that I address

1056
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.508
all three parts of the brain at the same time.

1057
00:42:46.508 --> 00:42:47.080
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1058
00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.212
<v ->Through very specific movement,</v>

1059
00:42:49.212 --> 00:42:50.486
very specific breathing,

1060
00:42:50.486 --> 00:42:52.618
very specific different kind of movement,

1061
00:42:52.618 --> 00:42:55.784
very specific different kind of breathing, and,

1062
00:42:56.482 --> 00:42:59.487
sort of, offering,

1063
00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:02.784
semi-hypnotic state at the same time.

1064
00:43:02.784 --> 00:43:03.252
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1065
00:43:03.252 --> 00:43:07.189
So, it's not done in a regular cognitive state of

1066
00:43:08.764 --> 00:43:09.804
<v Elena>mind.</v>
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1067
00:43:09.804 --> 00:43:11.900
<v ->But in the slightly altered state,</v>

1068
00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:16.264
where you can actually access the deeper memory,

1069
00:43:16.978 --> 00:43:19.706
from before the actual birth.

1070
00:43:19.706 --> 00:43:20.548
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1071
00:43:20.548 --> 00:43:22.054
So this is how you begin--

1072
00:43:22.054 --> 00:43:22.678
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1073
00:43:22.678 --> 00:43:25.322
<v Regina>to create this integration within the parent--</v>

1074
00:43:25.322 --> 00:43:26.156
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1075
00:43:26.156 --> 00:43:27.182
Mmhmm.

1076
00:43:27.182 --> 00:43:28.014
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1077
00:43:28.484 --> 00:43:33.111
So, between all of those experiences--

1078
00:43:33.111 --> 00:43:34.619
it's very experiential.

1079
00:43:34.619 --> 00:43:37.921
I do very little talking in my workshops, it's like,

1080
00:43:38.751 --> 00:43:40.728
do all the homework before you come,

1081
00:43:40.728 --> 00:43:43.172
because I don't really have time, we don't.

1082
00:43:43.172 --> 00:43:45.954
The shortest workshop is two days.

1083
00:43:45.954 --> 00:43:48.892
So we only have 16 hours, you know,

1084
00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:50.348
eight hour days, to,

1085
00:43:51.218 --> 00:43:53.487
bring you to completely different

1086
00:43:54.507 --> 00:43:58.118
quantum experience of owning your body, so,

1087
00:43:58.118 --> 00:44:00.640
the talking, you can do the reading,

1088
00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.070
you can watch my movie.

1089
00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:03.968
All the talking is sort of,

1090
00:44:04.948 --> 00:44:09.948
a preliminary pre-requisite for the workshop.

1091
00:44:10.487 --> 00:44:13.893
But in the workshop, it's mainly the

1092
00:44:18.733 --> 00:44:21.534
Self-assessment--

1093
00:44:21.534 --> 00:44:22.314
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1094
00:44:22.314 --> 00:44:24.680
<v ->of where you are, where you want to be,</v>

1095
00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.240
and getting there.

1096
00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.150
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1097
00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:31.589
And so, once the parent has gone through this,

1098
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:32.941
or person has gone through this,

1099
00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:36.139
who is not a parent-in-waiting yet (laughs),

1100
00:44:36.739 --> 00:44:38.530
what-- Let's talk about the next part,

1101
00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:40.142
which is then the bringing through

1102
00:44:40.142 --> 00:44:42.619
of the soul into the body.

1103
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:45.032
And the baby, bringing the body through.

1104
00:44:47.218 --> 00:44:47.996
The birth.

1105
00:44:48.038 --> 00:44:50.414
<v ->Well, what's there to talk about? (laughs)</v>

1106
00:44:50.658 --> 00:44:52.140
<v Regina>Yes. (laughs) So the parents prepared.</v>

1107
00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:53.766
You've now communicated with--

1108
00:44:53.766 --> 00:44:54.220
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

1109
00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.716
<v Regina>the being, and the being has told you,</v>

1110
00:44:56.716 --> 00:44:58.458
"I'm not a water baby."

1111
00:44:58.458 --> 00:44:58.990
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

1112
00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:00.694
<v Regina>"I wanna be in a nice, snuggly warm bed,</v>

1113
00:45:00.694 --> 00:45:03.138
"with feathers around me," or whatever they have said.

1114
00:45:03.748 --> 00:45:06.934
And then, are there some links in that process

1115
00:45:06.934 --> 00:45:10.260
that are then, or techniques that you share,

1116
00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:12.472
to keep the woman's body,

1117
00:45:12.472 --> 00:45:16.320
in this state of, as you say, this oxytocin-flowing

1118
00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.542
state of grace,

1119
00:45:17.542 --> 00:45:19.466
where you program it, so to speak,

1120
00:45:19.466 --> 00:45:22.118
to expect pleasure, instead of pain?

1121
00:45:23.238 --> 00:45:27.077
<v ->Well, I don't do anything, they--</v>

1122
00:45:27.967 --> 00:45:31.480
I don't go and create all those feathers for them.

1123
00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.076
It's--

1124
00:45:32.076 --> 00:45:33.678
<v Regina>But I mean, you've given them the--</v>

1125
00:45:33.678 --> 00:45:34.250
<v ->Right.</v>

1126
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:35.744
<v Regina>understanding this is possible.</v>

1127
00:45:35.744 --> 00:45:36.368
<v ->Right, right.</v>

1128
00:45:36.368 --> 00:45:37.278
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1129
00:45:37.278 --> 00:45:38.708
<v ->And then, they just need to</v>

1130
00:45:42.238 --> 00:45:44.962
maintenance is their own responsibility.

1131
00:45:44.962 --> 00:45:45.586
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1132
00:45:45.586 --> 00:45:46.978
(laughter)

1133
00:45:46.978 --> 00:45:48.290
I know that you're not going and

1134
00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:49.486
holding their hand through the birth.

1135
00:45:49.486 --> 00:45:51.478
That's not what I'm suggesting.

1136
00:45:51.478 --> 00:45:51.878
<v ->Yeah--</v>

1137
00:45:51.878 --> 00:45:53.256
<v Regina>But that process of,</v>

1138
00:45:53.256 --> 00:45:56.177
getting their mind confident and ready,

1139
00:45:56.177 --> 00:45:56.532
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1140
00:45:56.532 --> 00:45:58.664
<v Regina>and clear, to expect,</v>

1141
00:45:58.984 --> 00:46:02.359
an experience that is transformational,

1142
00:46:02.714 --> 00:46:04.600
more ecstatic than painful,

1143
00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:05.250
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1144
00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:07.788
<v Regina>and transmuting the pain into something</v>

1145
00:46:08.528 --> 00:46:11.584
more, not just manageable, but even ecstatic.

1146
00:46:11.584 --> 00:46:12.104
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1147
00:46:12.104 --> 00:46:12.910
<v Regina>Even orgasmic.</v>

1148
00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:14.230
So you've already--

1149
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:16.446
Your workshop-- you've already helped the people

1150
00:46:16.446 --> 00:46:17.356
on this level, to expect this,

1151
00:46:17.356 --> 00:46:17.974
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1152
00:46:17.974 --> 00:46:19.982
<v Regina>so this is the expectation.</v>

1153
00:46:19.982 --> 00:46:23.154
Let's talk about what happens when something goes wrong.

1154
00:46:23.154 --> 00:46:26.142
I think a lot of people in the Western culture,

1155
00:46:28.248 --> 00:46:31.196
don't embrace doing something different,

1156
00:46:31.196 --> 00:46:34.270
because, "oh my God, what if something went wrong,

1157
00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:34.754
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

1158
00:46:34.754 --> 00:46:37.148
"and I wasn't in the right place to have someone respond

1159
00:46:37.148 --> 00:46:38.682
"to the situation?"

1160
00:46:38.682 --> 00:46:40.684
I mean, it was through sheer intuition

1161
00:46:40.684 --> 00:46:42.454
that I happened to be in the hospital

1162
00:46:42.454 --> 00:46:43.752
when everything broke loose, and,

1163
00:46:43.752 --> 00:46:45.009
there was a team right there to--

1164
00:46:45.009 --> 00:46:45.705
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

1165
00:46:45.705 --> 00:46:46.919
<v Regina>get the baby out.</v>

1166
00:46:46.919 --> 00:46:49.343
But, that was because I am intuitive,

1167
00:46:49.343 --> 00:46:50.279
and I was listening,

1168
00:46:50.279 --> 00:46:52.281
and I happened to be on the way there anyway.

1169
00:46:52.281 --> 00:46:53.061
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

1170
00:46:53.061 --> 00:46:55.557
<v Regina>But, what about the average person that</v>

1171
00:46:55.557 --> 00:46:57.559
maybe doesn't feel confident in their intuition?

1172
00:46:57.559 --> 00:46:58.261
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

1173
00:46:59.471 --> 00:47:02.744
<v Regina>How, in this process, would you advise them,</v>

1174
00:47:02.744 --> 00:47:06.374
in the off chance something were to go wrong?

1175
00:47:06.774 --> 00:47:10.258
<v ->Well, again, I don't.</v>

1176
00:47:11.498 --> 00:47:14.734
That's the thing, that, there is,

1177
00:47:14.966 --> 00:47:19.507
My ability is limited by their own willingness

1178
00:47:19.507 --> 00:47:21.655
to open and,

1179
00:47:22.757 --> 00:47:26.530
and how much are they interested in

1180
00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:29.520
connecting with themselves, with their baby, you know.

1181
00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.860
There is not much I can do about it.

1182
00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:32.562
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1183
00:47:32.562 --> 00:47:34.356
<v ->What I am offering is,</v>

1184
00:47:34.776 --> 00:47:38.429
the two day workshop offers the equivalent of

1185
00:47:38.429 --> 00:47:39.703
getting a new software.

1186
00:47:39.703 --> 00:47:40.301
<v Regina>Right.</v>

1187
00:47:40.301 --> 00:47:41.549
<v ->For our hard drive.</v>

1188
00:47:41.549 --> 00:47:43.473
The second two days,

1189
00:47:43.473 --> 00:47:44.825
level two of my workshop,

1190
00:47:44.825 --> 00:47:48.699
is equivalent of installing of that software.

1191
00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:51.533
The next two days is,

1192
00:47:51.533 --> 00:47:54.653
learning to use it, and practicing.

1193
00:47:54.653 --> 00:47:58.865
So, this is basically, this is what I am offering.

1194
00:47:58.865 --> 00:47:59.645
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1195
00:47:59.645 --> 00:48:04.645
<v ->And this is what I am responsible for offering this.</v>

1196
00:48:05.027 --> 00:48:05.677
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1197
00:48:05.677 --> 00:48:06.743
So if they're--

1198
00:48:06.743 --> 00:48:08.537
<v ->And I have a pretty good track record.</v>

1199
00:48:08.537 --> 00:48:12.567
I think, maybe 98% success,

1200
00:48:12.567 --> 00:48:15.219
that nothing goes wrong in birth.

1201
00:48:15.219 --> 00:48:16.181
<v Regina>That's what I wanted to ask.</v>

1202
00:48:16.181 --> 00:48:17.611
If the people are prepared,

1203
00:48:17.611 --> 00:48:19.691
if the woman is prepared in this way,

1204
00:48:19.691 --> 00:48:22.707
if the body is relaxed and you allow natural processes,

1205
00:48:22.707 --> 00:48:23.279
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1206
00:48:23.279 --> 00:48:24.995
<v Regina>then you likely aren't going to run into</v>

1207
00:48:24.995 --> 00:48:26.061
those kinds of problems,

1208
00:48:26.061 --> 00:48:26.607
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1209
00:48:26.607 --> 00:48:28.505
<v Regina>unless you have a structural issue, like I have.</v>

1210
00:48:28.505 --> 00:48:30.195
<v ->Unless you have a mechanical,</v>

1211
00:48:30.195 --> 00:48:31.027
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1212
00:48:31.027 --> 00:48:33.289
<v ->or, sports injury, or--</v>

1213
00:48:33.289 --> 00:48:34.121
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1214
00:48:34.121 --> 00:48:36.837
You know, a car accident, or,

1215
00:48:36.837 --> 00:48:38.630
really just inborn,

1216
00:48:39.862 --> 00:48:43.424
some problem, with the pelvic floor, so.

1217
00:48:43.424 --> 00:48:44.594
<v Regina>So, in which case, you know--</v>

1218
00:48:44.594 --> 00:48:45.270
<v ->Right.</v>

1219
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.880
<v Regina>You should know that,</v>

1220
00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.662
and be aware, maybe, position yourself,

1221
00:48:47.662 --> 00:48:48.494
<v ->Exactly.</v>

1222
00:48:48.494 --> 00:48:49.924
<v Regina>so you're not far from help if you need it.</v>

1223
00:48:49.924 --> 00:48:50.808
<v ->Right, exactly.</v>

1224
00:48:50.808 --> 00:48:52.888
<v Regina>And still relax into the process and don't worry.</v>

1225
00:48:52.888 --> 00:48:55.072
<v ->Right, and even with C-section,</v>

1226
00:48:55.072 --> 00:48:56.918
it could be conscious C-section.

1227
00:48:56.918 --> 00:48:57.620
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1228
00:48:58.260 --> 00:48:59.373
<v ->Dimming the lights.</v>

1229
00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:02.359
Asking the delivery team,

1230
00:49:02.815 --> 00:49:04.791
be respectful and quiet.

1231
00:49:04.791 --> 00:49:07.781
They don't have to yell and,

1232
00:49:07.781 --> 00:49:09.393
"whooo, whoo," you know,

1233
00:49:09.393 --> 00:49:11.161
making all those loud noises.

1234
00:49:11.161 --> 00:49:13.059
They can be mindful,

1235
00:49:13.059 --> 00:49:13.553
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1236
00:49:13.553 --> 00:49:15.295
<v ->how they-- just put an instrument,</v>

1237
00:49:15.295 --> 00:49:17.011
instead of just throwing them and,

1238
00:49:17.011 --> 00:49:18.519
creating this big bang.

1239
00:49:18.519 --> 00:49:21.561
Or, you know,

1240
00:49:21.561 --> 00:49:25.071
not wiping the baby's skin like it's a kitchen counter,

1241
00:49:25.071 --> 00:49:30.071
and you know, making the baby just stress out,

1242
00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:32.585
from the crude handling.

1243
00:49:32.585 --> 00:49:33.131
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1244
00:49:33.131 --> 00:49:34.561
<v ->But treat the baby gently.</v>

1245
00:49:34.561 --> 00:49:36.667
Give baby a bath right away,

1246
00:49:36.667 --> 00:49:39.553
and put on momma's breast.

1247
00:49:39.553 --> 00:49:40.827
And breastfeed right away,

1248
00:49:40.827 --> 00:49:41.451
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1249
00:49:41.451 --> 00:49:42.517
<v ->and keep them together.</v>

1250
00:49:42.517 --> 00:49:45.429
And there is so many things that,

1251
00:49:49.249 --> 00:49:51.673
That could be done to

1252
00:49:51.673 --> 00:49:53.675
make even a C-section into

1253
00:49:53.675 --> 00:49:58.017
softer and more reasonable,

1254
00:49:58.017 --> 00:49:58.641
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1255
00:49:58.641 --> 00:49:59.993
<v ->from the baby's point of view.</v>

1256
00:49:59.993 --> 00:50:00.747
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1257
00:50:00.747 --> 00:50:01.813
<v ->experience.</v>

1258
00:50:04.523 --> 00:50:06.377
Circumcision, that's a big one.

1259
00:50:06.377 --> 00:50:07.469
<v Regina>Oh, boy.</v>

1260
00:50:07.469 --> 00:50:09.003
<v ->That's a big one, that,</v>

1261
00:50:09.003 --> 00:50:10.615
I don't know if you want to even go there, but--

1262
00:50:10.615 --> 00:50:12.461
<v Regina>Well, let's talk about voluntary C-section.</v>

1263
00:50:12.461 --> 00:50:14.307
A huge percentage of women say,

1264
00:50:14.307 --> 00:50:14.853
<v ->Right.</v>

1265
00:50:14.853 --> 00:50:16.257
<v Regina>"I wanna know when I'm having the baby.</v>

1266
00:50:16.497 --> 00:50:18.233
"I don't want it to go past a certain point."

1267
00:50:18.233 --> 00:50:19.117
<v ->Mmhmm.</v>

1268
00:50:19.117 --> 00:50:19.987
<v Regina>"Don't want those</v>

1269
00:50:19.987 --> 00:50:22.029
"last few weeks of stretch marks."

1270
00:50:22.029 --> 00:50:24.733
I mean, some really, a large perc--

1271
00:50:24.733 --> 00:50:25.981
and the doctors, themselves,

1272
00:50:25.981 --> 00:50:27.697
don't wanna be called out on the weekend.

1273
00:50:27.697 --> 00:50:28.321
<v ->Right.</v>

1274
00:50:28.751 --> 00:50:29.933
<v Regina>What do you have to say about this?</v>

1275
00:50:29.933 --> 00:50:32.843
<v ->Well, I want to say that,</v>

1276
00:50:33.253 --> 00:50:35.115
there is price for everything.

1277
00:50:35.115 --> 00:50:37.247
You know, the convenience of knowing

1278
00:50:37.247 --> 00:50:39.041
when exactly it happens,

1279
00:50:40.261 --> 00:50:43.434
might be inconvenience of then having

1280
00:50:43.434 --> 00:50:45.821
sleepness nights for the next two years.

1281
00:50:46.448 --> 00:50:48.925
Because the baby's digestive system

1282
00:50:48.925 --> 00:50:50.345
is compromised.

1283
00:50:50.355 --> 00:50:53.007
The breathing system is compromised.

1284
00:50:53.007 --> 00:50:57.843
Then, all the drama that comes with the baby

1285
00:50:57.843 --> 00:51:00.209
not going through the birth canal,

1286
00:51:00.209 --> 00:51:03.095
just because of the convenience of the timing.

1287
00:51:03.095 --> 00:51:07.827
It creates so many more inconveniences,

1288
00:51:07.827 --> 00:51:10.713
in handling that baby that

1289
00:51:10.713 --> 00:51:13.859
has a inactivated digestive system.

1290
00:51:13.859 --> 00:51:17.317
You know, it's really, it doesn't pay off.

1291
00:51:17.317 --> 00:51:18.669
And the thing is that,

1292
00:51:18.669 --> 00:51:20.957
it's a major abdominal surgery.

1293
00:51:20.957 --> 00:51:21.945
<v Regina>Yes, it is.</v>

1294
00:51:21.945 --> 00:51:24.389
<v ->It's a major abdominal surgery,</v>

1295
00:51:24.389 --> 00:51:29.389
that the woman's body gets an assault.

1296
00:51:29.953 --> 00:51:31.747
You know, on all systems.

1297
00:51:31.747 --> 00:51:36.531
So inconvenience in time, again, is not worth it.

1298
00:51:36.531 --> 00:51:38.949
If there is a way of avoiding it,

1299
00:51:39.879 --> 00:51:40.796
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1300
00:51:41.846 --> 00:51:45.367
<v ->I would encourage women to really do a research.</v>

1301
00:51:45.367 --> 00:51:48.123
First of all, there is a lot of research

1302
00:51:48.743 --> 00:51:50.334
available already.

1303
00:51:50.334 --> 00:51:52.908
There is 15 years of research on

1304
00:51:52.908 --> 00:51:55.827
birth psychology that come, that shows all the

1305
00:51:56.742 --> 00:52:00.231
very dramatic emotional, psychological,

1306
00:52:00.231 --> 00:52:03.403
physiological side effects,

1307
00:52:03.403 --> 00:52:05.410
for the baby and the mother.

1308
00:52:08.495 --> 00:52:09.730
Just, do your homework.

1309
00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:10.460
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1310
00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.570
<v ->This is what I basically want to say.</v>

1311
00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:14.627
If you're not

1312
00:52:16.765 --> 00:52:18.641
bound to have the C-section,

1313
00:52:18.641 --> 00:52:22.863
just because this is what is happening, with the baby.

1314
00:52:22.863 --> 00:52:24.059
And that's the thing that,

1315
00:52:24.059 --> 00:52:25.801
if baby doesn't want the C-section,

1316
00:52:25.801 --> 00:52:27.387
with that particular mother,

1317
00:52:27.387 --> 00:52:30.091
that baby would have chosen a different mother,

1318
00:52:30.091 --> 00:52:32.821
that would be able to avoid C-section.

1319
00:52:32.821 --> 00:52:33.471
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1320
00:52:33.471 --> 00:52:35.473
<v ->So, C-section is,</v>

1321
00:52:36.243 --> 00:52:39.510
the true medical indication for C-section is

1322
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:41.798
a very specific journey

1323
00:52:41.798 --> 00:52:42.474
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1324
00:52:42.474 --> 00:52:45.256
<v ->that both the mother and the baby are undertaking.</v>

1325
00:52:45.256 --> 00:52:45.958
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1326
00:52:45.958 --> 00:52:49.572
<v ->But if it's just laziness.</v>

1327
00:52:49.572 --> 00:52:54.044
If it's just a social kind of, fad.

1328
00:52:54.044 --> 00:52:57.346
I know that women in Brazil right now,

1329
00:52:57.746 --> 00:53:00.593
there is 90% C-section rate in Brazil.

1330
00:53:00.593 --> 00:53:01.399
<v Regina>Oh my God.</v>

1331
00:53:01.399 --> 00:53:04.025
<v ->And those underprivileged,</v>

1332
00:53:04.025 --> 00:53:06.235
that could not afford C-section,

1333
00:53:06.235 --> 00:53:10.203
they tattoo scars on their belly to pretend like they did.

1334
00:53:10.629 --> 00:53:12.169
(Regina sighs heavily)

1335
00:53:12.169 --> 00:53:13.017
Yeah.

1336
00:53:13.955 --> 00:53:14.560
<v Regina>Okay, well--</v>

1337
00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:15.803
<v ->It's gone that far.</v>

1338
00:53:15.803 --> 00:53:16.609
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1339
00:53:16.609 --> 00:53:20.327
<v ->And, even sometimes, they actually cut the skin,</v>

1340
00:53:20.327 --> 00:53:22.823
to make it like a real scar,

1341
00:53:22.823 --> 00:53:24.903
because it's a sign of prestige.

1342
00:53:24.903 --> 00:53:25.605
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1343
00:53:25.605 --> 00:53:29.297
<v ->That's a sign of privileged lifestyle, you know,</v>

1344
00:53:29.297 --> 00:53:30.961
to show up in your bikini with that--

1345
00:53:30.961 --> 00:53:31.951
<v Regina>Well, and to an up-and-coming nation--</v>

1346
00:53:31.951 --> 00:53:32.763
<v ->pretty scar.</v>

1347
00:53:32.763 --> 00:53:34.653
<v Regina>you know, we can't judge that.</v>

1348
00:53:34.653 --> 00:53:36.332
We don't understand the psychology.

1349
00:53:36.332 --> 00:53:36.948
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1350
00:53:36.948 --> 00:53:38.776
<v Regina>But, we can see it's another reflection--</v>

1351
00:53:38.776 --> 00:53:39.196
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1352
00:53:39.196 --> 00:53:39.996
<v Regina>just as Siberia.</v>

1353
00:53:39.996 --> 00:53:41.048
Just as the coldness--

1354
00:53:41.048 --> 00:53:41.712
<v ->Right.</v>

1355
00:53:41.712 --> 00:53:42.746
<v Regina>and harshness of the--</v>

1356
00:53:42.746 --> 00:53:43.244
<v ->Right.</v>

1357
00:53:43.244 --> 00:53:44.340
<v Regina>American experience,</v>

1358
00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:45.250
they're simply out of balance.

1359
00:53:45.250 --> 00:53:47.407
<v ->Right, and actually,</v>

1360
00:53:47.407 --> 00:53:49.487
a few Brazilian women told me

1361
00:53:49.487 --> 00:53:52.165
that their decision for C-section was because

1362
00:53:52.165 --> 00:53:54.531
Angelina Jolie had a C-section. (laughs)

1363
00:53:54.531 --> 00:53:55.467
<v Regina>Oh God. (laughs)</v>

1364
00:53:56.477 --> 00:53:57.388
<v ->They're so--</v>

1365
00:53:57.388 --> 00:53:58.782
<v Regina>Well, there ya go.</v>

1366
00:53:58.782 --> 00:54:00.920
Mmkay. So.

1367
00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:03.728
<v ->So, going back to</v>

1368
00:54:06.252 --> 00:54:10.732
the preparation for birth,

1369
00:54:10.732 --> 00:54:13.306
most of the complications are avoidable.

1370
00:54:13.306 --> 00:54:14.138
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1371
00:54:14.138 --> 00:54:15.750
<v ->Unless they are,</v>

1372
00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:18.769
physiological, mechanical.

1373
00:54:19.959 --> 00:54:22.370
Real, you know, health issue.

1374
00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:23.202
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1375
00:54:24.202 --> 00:54:26.923
<v ->Then, the great majority of them,</v>

1376
00:54:26.923 --> 00:54:28.876
is emotional and psychological.

1377
00:54:29.081 --> 00:54:30.095
<v Regina>And so, you say</v>

1378
00:54:30.095 --> 00:54:31.395
with the clients you've worked with,

1379
00:54:31.395 --> 00:54:33.111
you're talking a 98%.

1380
00:54:33.111 --> 00:54:33.735
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1381
00:54:33.735 --> 00:54:35.707
<v Regina>And would that be considered normal?</v>

1382
00:54:36.267 --> 00:54:37.037
Is that normal?

1383
00:54:37.037 --> 00:54:38.597
I mean, we know that, historically,

1384
00:54:38.597 --> 00:54:41.457
a lot of women died in childbirth in past times.

1385
00:54:41.457 --> 00:54:42.367
<v ->Uh, actually, no.</v>

1386
00:54:42.367 --> 00:54:43.355
<v Regina>Didn't they?</v>

1387
00:54:43.355 --> 00:54:44.473
<v ->No, it's a myth.</v>

1388
00:54:44.473 --> 00:54:45.175
<v Regina>Is that a myth?</v>

1389
00:54:45.175 --> 00:54:46.293
<v ->Yes, it is a myth, it's--</v>

1390
00:54:46.293 --> 00:54:47.203
<v Regina>You read all these...</v>

1391
00:54:47.203 --> 00:54:48.789
Now it's not true?

1392
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:52.169
Well, certainly in genealogy you run into some of this, but.

1393
00:54:52.169 --> 00:54:56.407
<v ->You know, it's a very convenient myth,</v>

1394
00:54:56.407 --> 00:54:59.449
that childbirth is inherently dangerous.

1395
00:54:59.449 --> 00:55:00.177
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1396
00:55:00.177 --> 00:55:01.399
<v ->But it's not the reality.</v>

1397
00:55:01.399 --> 00:55:02.595
The thing is that,

1398
00:55:02.595 --> 00:55:06.521
yes, we used to have high mortality.

1399
00:55:06.521 --> 00:55:11.201
But it's not due to the design of the procreation.

1400
00:55:11.201 --> 00:55:14.347
It's due to, malnutrition.

1401
00:55:14.347 --> 00:55:15.023
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1402
00:55:15.023 --> 00:55:17.805
<v ->Due to severe abuse of the woman.</v>

1403
00:55:17.805 --> 00:55:22.182
Due to wars, and plagues, and, just--

1404
00:55:22.182 --> 00:55:23.612
<v Regina>Lack of hygiene, many things.</v>

1405
00:55:23.612 --> 00:55:25.224
<v ->Hygiene is the biggest one.</v>

1406
00:55:25.224 --> 00:55:25.770
<v Regina>Yes, yeah.</v>

1407
00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:28.270
<v ->But also, just think about it.</v>

1408
00:55:29.238 --> 00:55:32.253
Throughout most of the history of humankind,

1409
00:55:32.253 --> 00:55:37.219
women were given into the wifely situation,

1410
00:55:37.219 --> 00:55:40.989
into wifely duty, before even childbearing age.

1411
00:55:40.989 --> 00:55:41.847
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1412
00:55:41.847 --> 00:55:43.329
Yes, so we can understand--

1413
00:55:43.329 --> 00:55:44.525
<v ->Just bring to consideration that--</v>

1414
00:55:44.525 --> 00:55:45.617
<v Regina>So there were other--</v>

1415
00:55:45.617 --> 00:55:46.279
<v ->Right.</v>

1416
00:55:46.279 --> 00:55:47.853
<v Regina>If you have a normal, healthy person,</v>

1417
00:55:47.853 --> 00:55:49.699
who has chosen their mate.

1418
00:55:49.699 --> 00:55:50.349
<v ->Right.</v>

1419
00:55:50.349 --> 00:55:52.819
<v Regina>And who is conceiving the baby out of love, and</v>

1420
00:55:52.819 --> 00:55:53.443
<v ->Right.</v>

1421
00:55:53.443 --> 00:55:54.825
<v Regina>going through this natural process,</v>

1422
00:55:54.825 --> 00:55:56.485
statistically, we should have what?

1423
00:55:56.485 --> 00:55:58.409
98%, like your success rate?

1424
00:55:58.409 --> 00:55:59.137
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1425
00:55:59.137 --> 00:55:59.657
Yeah.

1426
00:55:59.657 --> 00:56:00.295
<v Regina>That's beautiful.</v>

1427
00:56:00.295 --> 00:56:01.203
<v ->That's the thing, that,</v>

1428
00:56:01.203 --> 00:56:05.325
we don't have a good track record as a specie.

1429
00:56:05.325 --> 00:56:09.927
Our history is very violent, very, bloody,

1430
00:56:09.927 --> 00:56:13.879
and emotionally, not healthy, you know?

1431
00:56:13.879 --> 00:56:16.869
Historically, we are, for the first time,

1432
00:56:16.869 --> 00:56:20.777
where women can choose their partners.

1433
00:56:21.257 --> 00:56:25.891
Where bringing a baby in love is even an option.

1434
00:56:25.891 --> 00:56:26.723
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1435
00:56:26.723 --> 00:56:28.413
<v ->Because, if we think about,</v>

1436
00:56:28.413 --> 00:56:31.809
some village where a girl is given away,

1437
00:56:31.809 --> 00:56:33.592
basically into slavery.

1438
00:56:33.899 --> 00:56:37.357
Not only to the husband that she never saw before.

1439
00:56:37.357 --> 00:56:41.803
But to all his brothers, and all the wives of his brothers,

1440
00:56:41.803 --> 00:56:44.351
and the worst of all, his mother.

1441
00:56:44.351 --> 00:56:45.029
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1442
00:56:45.029 --> 00:56:48.074
<v ->And his father, then the auntie, so, basically.</v>

1443
00:56:49.474 --> 00:56:52.120
Is she happy being pregnant?

1444
00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:52.660
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1445
00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:54.944
<v ->Does she even want that baby?</v>

1446
00:56:54.944 --> 00:56:55.650
<v Regina>Right, that--</v>

1447
00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:56.202
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1448
00:56:56.202 --> 00:56:57.154
<v Regina>Thank you for explaining--</v>

1449
00:56:57.154 --> 00:56:57.434
<v ->Yes.</v>

1450
00:56:57.434 --> 00:56:58.748
<v Regina>all the factors that surround</v>

1451
00:56:58.748 --> 00:57:00.234
the mortality of the past.

1452
00:57:00.234 --> 00:57:00.946
<v Elena>Yes, and that's the thing--</v>
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1453
00:57:00.946 --> 00:57:02.246
<v ->If a woman is depressed.</v>

1454
00:57:02.246 --> 00:57:04.508
If she is completely disoriented.

1455
00:57:04.508 --> 00:57:07.264
If she's lonely, all her girlfriends are,

1456
00:57:07.264 --> 00:57:09.214
left back at home, you know.

1457
00:57:09.214 --> 00:57:10.748
Three days' horse ride.

1458
00:57:10.748 --> 00:57:11.450
<v Regina>Mmhmm.</v>

1459
00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:13.946
<v ->Or in African village, where there's--</v>

1460
00:57:13.946 --> 00:57:15.220
women are circumsized,

1461
00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:15.792
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1462
00:57:15.792 --> 00:57:18.366
<v ->and the childbirth is basically,</v>

1463
00:57:18.366 --> 00:57:21.408
the worst human torture possible,

1464
00:57:21.408 --> 00:57:22.006
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1465
00:57:22.006 --> 00:57:25.100
through a circumsized yoni.

1466
00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:25.776
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1467
00:57:25.776 --> 00:57:30.237
<v ->So, we don't really have</v>

1468
00:57:30.237 --> 00:57:32.905
a good historical

1469
00:57:33.695 --> 00:57:37.647
overview of what childbirth mortality would look like,

1470
00:57:37.647 --> 00:57:40.295
if women are in their power.

1471
00:57:40.755 --> 00:57:45.203
If women are emotionally healthy, and,

1472
00:57:45.945 --> 00:57:49.432
nutritionally supported.

1473
00:57:50.274 --> 00:57:52.042
And when they're not stressing out,

1474
00:57:52.042 --> 00:57:55.574
how they're gonna feed that baby, and, you know.

1475
00:57:55.574 --> 00:57:56.176
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1476
00:57:56.176 --> 00:57:57.233
<v ->Yeah.</v>

1477
00:57:57.233 --> 00:57:59.521
<v Regina>Well, all I can say, cause I know we are</v>

1478
00:57:59.521 --> 00:58:01.291
just about out of tape here, is,

1479
00:58:02.221 --> 00:58:02.953
thank you.

1480
00:58:02.953 --> 00:58:06.489
To thank you, for the many years you've put into this,

1481
00:58:06.489 --> 00:58:11.198
and helping us understand this and bring this back to

1482
00:58:11.198 --> 00:58:12.785
a joyful experience.

1483
00:58:13.965 --> 00:58:16.331
A powerful experience, that it should be.

1484
00:58:16.331 --> 00:58:17.033
<v ->Yes.</v>

1485
00:58:17.033 --> 00:58:18.047
<v Regina>And any final thoughts?</v>

1486
00:58:18.047 --> 00:58:19.165
We have just a couple minutes.

1487
00:58:19.165 --> 00:58:21.297
<v ->The final thought is that,</v>

1488
00:58:21.297 --> 00:58:24.547
that supreme intelligence that created

1489
00:58:24.547 --> 00:58:27.225
the miraculous bodies that we have,

1490
00:58:27.225 --> 00:58:30.787
that has built in mechanism for healing, for

1491
00:58:31.247 --> 00:58:33.203
amazing amount of pleasure.

1492
00:58:33.203 --> 00:58:35.673
Every skin-- every cell on our skin

1493
00:58:35.673 --> 00:58:37.259
has a pleasure receptacle.

1494
00:58:37.259 --> 00:58:40.405
It's, they're for a good reason, (laughs) trust me.

1495
00:58:40.745 --> 00:58:44.478
So, that supreme intelligence did not overlook

1496
00:58:44.747 --> 00:58:49.626
such a basic function as procreation.

1497
00:58:50.723 --> 00:58:51.607
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

1498
00:58:51.607 --> 00:58:54.285
<v ->Let's just trust that supreme intelligence</v>

1499
00:58:54.285 --> 00:58:56.443
that created us in the first place,

1500
00:58:56.443 --> 00:59:00.421
and it did not mean us to suffer through

1501
00:59:00.421 --> 00:59:02.684
creating the next generation.

1502
00:59:02.684 --> 00:59:06.817
We are meant to bring the next generation

1503
00:59:06.817 --> 00:59:08.637
in love and dignity.

1504
00:59:08.637 --> 00:59:10.795
And bring in heaven to Earth.

1505
00:59:11.715 --> 00:59:14.922
Just in one generation, this is where I'm standing.

1506
00:59:14.922 --> 00:59:16.716
This is what I'm working for.

1507
00:59:16.716 --> 00:59:20.278
I believe that we are 20 years away from heaven on Earth.

1508
00:59:20.968 --> 00:59:22.074
<v Regina>On that note,</v>

1509
00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:24.896
I'm with you on that one, and thank you,

1510
00:59:24.896 --> 00:59:27.360
so much for your wisdom and your time.

1511
00:59:27.678 --> 00:59:29.560
<v ->My pleasure. (laughs)</v>

1512
00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:32.553
It was my pleasure to speak with you.

1513
00:59:35.008 --> 00:59:37.502
<v ->You can learn more about Elena's birthing preparation,</v>

1514
00:59:37.502 --> 00:59:40.674
by going to her website at birthasweknowit.com.

1515
00:59:40.674 --> 00:59:42.807
She gives classes around the world,

1516
00:59:42.807 --> 00:59:45.224
which give prospective parents and singles both,

1517
00:59:45.224 --> 00:59:47.408
an opportunity to work through

1518
00:59:47.408 --> 00:59:49.358
our own birth-related trauma.

1519
00:59:49.358 --> 00:59:51.880
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

1520
00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:56.238
