00:00:01.473 --> 00:00:04.419 align:middle line:10%

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:24.534 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.534 --> 00:00:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever looked
at religious paintings

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.420 align:middle line:84%
and wondered what the halo means
or the glow that emanates from

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.610 align:middle line:90%
history's great sages?

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.720 align:middle line:84%
William Henry says,
in his newest book,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.750 align:middle line:84%
"The Light of Sion,"
that these are not simply

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.360 align:middle line:84%
depictions of an elevated
or saintly status,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.670 align:middle line:84%
but are, quite literally,
a garment of light

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.370 align:middle line:84%
that the great adepts used
to pass from one dimension

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Their roadway from
one field to another

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.420 align:middle line:90%
is what we call wormholes.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:84%
An amazing collection of
artwork helps tell the story

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:84%
and, according to
William, can facilitate

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.450 align:middle line:84%
our own internal shift
by simply gazing at them.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.080 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:84%
It's so nice sitting
with you again.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.120 align:middle line:84%
As always, your energy
just fills up the room

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:90%
with sparkles and intelligence.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And so what I thought
I'd do is I've already

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.950 align:middle line:84%
encouraged everyone that didn't
see the last interview to go

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.320 align:middle line:84%
ahead and pick up with that
one, because we're going

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.480 align:middle line:90%
to continue on from there.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.920 align:middle line:84%
You've down a lot
of work since then.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that's
really intriguing me is--

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:84%
and let's go back
to the wormhole.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.660 align:middle line:90%
We need to go back to Osiris.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back over
some of that and how

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.230 align:middle line:84%
that plays into the time of
Jesus as a star traveler,

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.580 align:middle line:84%
into Buddha, and a lot of
the Buddhist traditions,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and the iconography,
and the imagery

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.680 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing regarding
this body of light,

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.130 align:middle line:90%
and how it all ties together.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.070 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to
have you launch on it,

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.310 align:middle line:84%
from where we were,
and take it from there.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you for having
me on again, Regina.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.480 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
that, to begin.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:90%
And Scott, of course.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.420 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.350 align:middle line:84%
The basis of my work is
that stargates are real.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:90%
They were known to the ancients.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.130 align:middle line:84%
They were accessed
and utilized by what

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.170 align:middle line:90%
we think of as the gods.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.320 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that I've
kind of keyed in on--

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and people always ask me this--
is, is there a stargate device?

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean people talk
the Black Ops--

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.740 align:middle line:84%
they've got a stargate device,
and they're beaming into Mars,

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.770 align:middle line:90%
and all of this.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
I've never seen that.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any direct
evidence of that.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.150 align:middle line:84%
But what I do see
in the ancient world

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.270 align:middle line:84%
is an emphasis on
these gateways,

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.030 align:middle line:84%
but, most specifically,
whenever you see gateway stories

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.335 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient world--

00:02:34.335 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter if
it's Egypt, Iran, Iraq--

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
anywhere-- you're going to see
stories of transformation that

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.320 align:middle line:90%
go along with it.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Because the bottom line
message that the ancients had

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:84%
is that the stargate
device is us.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:90%
Our body is the stargate device.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.020 align:middle line:84%
They weren't looking for any
kind of a machine out here,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.960 align:middle line:84%
they were looking to master this
machine-- the human machine,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.670 align:middle line:84%
the human as E.J.
Gold called it--

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.550 align:middle line:84%
the biological
transformational apparatus.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.560 align:middle line:84%
From the soul's
perspective, our body

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:84%
is the ladder tower
or stairway to heaven.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And so what I've
been focusing on

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.470 align:middle line:84%
is, OK, let's find those stories
of transformation of the gods

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.272 align:middle line:84%
coming down and
perfecting humankind.

00:03:16.272 --> 00:03:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's the term
that they used.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important
word, as you

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.470 align:middle line:84%
begin doing this research--
the word perfect.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.400 align:middle line:84%
It means to make whole, to
make holy, to make complete.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the
stargate quest, if you will.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.120 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
access these gateways,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.052 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to go
as less than anything

00:03:35.052 --> 00:03:36.510 align:middle line:84%
less than a pure
being because it's

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.434 align:middle line:84%
going to be like
walking into a blender.

00:03:38.434 --> 00:03:40.350 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get your
feathers ruffled, OK?

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>> You're going to get
splattered all over the place.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.540 align:middle line:84%
So what we're
talking about here is

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.210 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate human
transformation--

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.510 align:middle line:84%
taking this body, spinning
it into a vortex of energy,

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.990 align:middle line:84%
which they call the rainbow
body, in the Tibetan tradition.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.480 align:middle line:84%
They call it Osiris or the
crossed body, in ancient Egypt.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.470 align:middle line:84%
It's the body of light, the
Resurrection body, the glory

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:90%
body, in Christianity.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.190 align:middle line:84%
All of these traditions
talk about it.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>> It's in the Maya
tradition, right?

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:84%
It's in the Mayan
tradition, too.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.190 align:middle line:84%
All these-- we call them
Resurrection teachings.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.430 align:middle line:84%
That sounds like a religious
word, it's really not.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.805 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
preparing yourself

00:04:14.805 --> 00:04:18.300 align:middle line:84%
for becoming a stargate
traveling, time traveler.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And these stories are
all over the place.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's artwork
that reflects this.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And this what I've been going
about trying to collect--

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:84%
this artwork-- because
that's primarily

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:84%
how this teaching
is transmitted.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not done
through books, it's

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.870 align:middle line:84%
done visually,
through coded artwork.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>> You've done a
beautiful, beautiful job

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:90%
on your collection.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.350 align:middle line:84%
This latest book--
just gorgeous.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.308 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, well, thank you.

00:04:39.308 --> 00:04:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, the texture and
the diversity of the type

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:84%
of imagery you have to support
this is really exceptional.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, the book is
called "The Secret of Sion,"

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.500 align:middle line:84%
the subtitle is, "Jesus'
Stargate, the Beaming Garment

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.790 align:middle line:84%
and the Galactic Core
in Ascension Art."

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to link those
three concepts together.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Jesus' stargate-- you'll see
this gateway in, especially,

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.470 align:middle line:84%
transfiguration
artwork of Jesus, where

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:84%
he takes the disciples up
to the top of the mountain

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and reveals himself
as a being of light.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.380 align:middle line:90%
He morphs.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.070 align:middle line:90%
The Greek word is metamorphosis.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.900 align:middle line:84%
He affects this transformation
and reveals his true self,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.837 align:middle line:90%
which is a light being.

00:05:18.837 --> 00:05:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me ask you a
question at this point--

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.280 align:middle line:84%
now what is it, in all of
this that you've discovered,

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.020 align:middle line:84%
that takes us beyond
something that's

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.250 align:middle line:84%
religious and metaphorical
into something real?

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, one, just the
sheer volume of these accounts

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.850 align:middle line:84%
tells me that it's a real
experience, plus, I mean,

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.510 align:middle line:84%
it's been duplicated
in modern times,

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.610 align:middle line:84%
according to the Tibetans, where
people do achieve the rainbow

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.650 align:middle line:90%
body in modern times.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.050 align:middle line:90%
It's an actual experience.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So I assume the fact that
these incidents have been

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.200 align:middle line:84%
recorded over vast
stretches of time,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.770 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
cultures of the world?

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Because a lot of
people think, oh,

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.030 align:middle line:90%
it's just metaphorical.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.300 align:middle line:90%
It's just--

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's not.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's a highly
energetic thing as well.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I use the term
the beaming garment

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.290 align:middle line:84%
because that's the term
they use in ancient Iran.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the idea is that when
they put on this light body

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.610 align:middle line:90%
garment, they literally beam.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:84%
They radiate light,
they glow rays.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.680 align:middle line:84%
That's the meaning of
the word to be glorious.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.370 align:middle line:84%
When God "comes in
glory" he's glowing rays.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Usually, rainbow colored
rays in the artwork

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.350 align:middle line:84%
because he's in
his rainbow body.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And this energy
is transmittable.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.440 align:middle line:84%
It goes from person to person,
generation to generation.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.060 align:middle line:84%
It goes vertically through time,
and then across generations,

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.590 align:middle line:90%
and across cultures.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And you see it all
over the place.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And that, again, assures me that
it's real and that any of us

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.200 align:middle line:84%
can reach that frequency as
well, because, again, it's

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:90%
a transmittable phenomenon.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the classic story of
this transmission is Elijah.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.040 align:middle line:84%
He's going to ascend into
the heavens in a whirlwind.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.900 align:middle line:84%
He's going to
enter heaven alive.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.250 align:middle line:90%
He didn't have to die first.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.490 align:middle line:90%
He's entering heaven alive.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's described as
ascending into the heavens

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.710 align:middle line:84%
in a whirlwind, which is
suggest some kind of a vortex,

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.040 align:middle line:90%
maybe a portal.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And as Elijah's ascending, he
turns to his priest, Elisha,

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
and transmits to him his holy
garment called his pallium.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And now Elisha takes over
this line of transmission.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, the idea is then that
Elijah then reincarnates

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.540 align:middle line:90%
as John the Baptist.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And what do you see
in baptism scenes?

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.450 align:middle line:84%
You see John the
Baptist baptizing

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Jesus in the River
Jordan, which, I think,

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.260 align:middle line:90%
is actually the Milky Way.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.230 align:middle line:84%
He's initiating him in some
kind of cosmic teaching

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.860 align:middle line:90%
about the Milky Way.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.770 align:middle line:84%
I suggest that because
the root of the word

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Jordan comes from the Babylonian
word [? Eridanu ?] which

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.350 align:middle line:90%
means river of life--

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.550 align:middle line:90%
dot, dot, dot-- the Milky Way.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So he's initiating something
about the Milky Way, probably

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.690 align:middle line:90%
some cosmic energy.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And you see an angel that's
waiting there, in these baptism

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:03.720 align:middle line:84%
scenes, to give Jesus
his beaming garment.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And then Jesus fully manifests
this at the transfiguration.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So we're showing that this is an
energetic thing, to begin with,

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:15.204 align:middle line:90%
and that it's transmittable.

00:08:15.204 --> 00:08:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Before we go
further into that,

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.890 align:middle line:84%
what is the resistance
in modern human beings?

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:25.290 align:middle line:84%
When we see this ancient,
medieval, Renaissance artwork

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.760 align:middle line:90%
that has these depictions--

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.770 align:middle line:84%
right down to depictions
of what look like UFO

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:90%
beaming down onto Mary--

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do we automatically
assume that this is

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:40.169 align:middle line:90%
the imaginings of savages?

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I think part of it--

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I show people
the transfiguration scenes,

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.750 align:middle line:90%
I say, this is within you.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.055 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're
supposed to be doing.

00:08:51.055 --> 00:08:53.430 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is we're like
the caterpillars looking up

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.010 align:middle line:84%
at the butterfly, saying,
you'll never get me up

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:90%
in one of those things.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a gap.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.560 align:middle line:90%
A big gap.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>> It's called belief,
it's called fear.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
this time is about--

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.160 align:middle line:84%
breaking down that fear
and closing that gap.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's just cultural
programming, basically.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we all grow up--

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.530 align:middle line:84%
at least in Western
civilization--

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.900 align:middle line:84%
with self-esteem problems,
self-confidence problems.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And to say that you can
become a Christ-like being

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.940 align:middle line:84%
sounds utterly
ridiculous to people.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.050 align:middle line:90%
How dare you who?

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:22.410 align:middle line:90%
Who do you think you are?

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Who do you think you are?

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>> At the same time, we're all
getting more comfortable with

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.280 align:middle line:84%
the notion that there is
something of a cosmic alignment

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.270 align:middle line:90%
that is lining up here.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>> That we are
looking at the sun--

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.010 align:middle line:84%
our sun-- and our galaxy moving
toward the galactic center.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And so even from
NASA's point of view,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:84%
you've got some energy
pulsing out of this center.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, you take that with
the overlay that if you're open

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.220 align:middle line:90%
to this--

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people watching
are already well open to this.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>> We are
multi-dimensional beings,

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle line:84%
even if we don't quite
grok what that means.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> How could we not be going
through something like this?

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And so part of
what we have to do

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.489 align:middle line:84%
is to take our identification
off the caterpillar

00:10:04.489 --> 00:10:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and begin to put it
on the butterfly.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the artwork
comes in because it gives us

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:90%
a focus, it gives us a target.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
creators of this artwork,

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.680 align:middle line:84%
they created it
with the intention

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:84%
that it would transmit to
you this holy vibration.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you're looking
at a transfiguration icon,

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.710 align:middle line:90%
it's not just a pretty picture.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.380 align:middle line:84%
According to the intention of
the artist that created it,

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.780 align:middle line:84%
they believed that
you could mirror

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:84%
the energy that's
being experienced

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.757 align:middle line:90%
by Jesus at that moment--

00:10:34.757 --> 00:10:36.840 align:middle line:84%
mentally, physically,
spiritually and emotionally.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is how they
transmitted this teaching.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:90%
It was through the artwork.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.020 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
written about it.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.561 align:middle line:84%
And they would have
expressions like,

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:48.600 align:middle line:84%
enter through the image and
the image itself will show you

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:90%
the way.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is why a
lot of this artwork

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:55.440 align:middle line:84%
has been coveted, by the way,
because all of these artists--

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one very good
example is John van Eyck.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:84%
When he introduced his
paintings, especially

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:84%
the "Mystic Lamb"
painting, it was sort of,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.765 align:middle line:84%
during the Renaissance, it was
"The Beatles on Ed Sullivan"

00:11:08.765 --> 00:11:09.565 align:middle line:90%
moment.

00:11:09.565 --> 00:11:10.365 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:10.365 --> 00:11:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, Tom Petty said, hey,
when The Beatles played on Ed

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Sullivan, they showed
us not only what to do,

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.380 align:middle line:90%
but how to do it.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the effect that
van Eyck had on Leonardo,

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.897 align:middle line:84%
on Botticelli, on Fra
Angelico and others.

00:11:24.897 --> 00:11:27.230 align:middle line:84%
It was like, wait a minute,
this art that we're creating

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.140 align:middle line:84%
is not just art, it
transmits this vibration.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes
it so powerful, and why,

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.720 align:middle line:84%
down through the ages,
it has been so popular,

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and been just
enormously admired.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you talk a
little bit about that?

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go back into
Jesus as the star traveler

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.660 align:middle line:84%
because this has such a huge
impact on such a large portion

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:48.800 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Very difficult to see
it that way, right?

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>> But let's look it down--

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.270 align:middle line:84%
as you say, Sandro
Botticelli and also da Vinci.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some of the
reflections of that influence

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.060 align:middle line:90%
on them, in their art.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have to bear in mind
that the de' Medici family,

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.610 align:middle line:84%
during the Renaissance, had
spent, in today's dollars,

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:84%
$50 million looking for
the Corpus Hermeticum,

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.440 align:middle line:84%
looking for the chemical
secrets of the ancients.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.450 align:middle line:90%
And they found it.

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And they began the process of
translating it and westernizing

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.150 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Then they would go to a master
artist, like Botticelli,

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:24.950 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, you're
the guy that's

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:28.850 align:middle line:84%
going to encode this for us
and carry it through the ages.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a really
wonderful example of this.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.890 align:middle line:84%
It's his "Pallas and
the Centaur" painting,

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:37.550 align:middle line:84%
where he shows Pallas Athena
in this transparent gown.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:39.050 align:middle line:90%
She has diamonds on her nipples.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.880 align:middle line:90%
A diamond crown on.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And she's in her transparent,
light body-- her ascension

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.220 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.678 align:middle line:84%
And to look at it
on one level, you

00:12:47.678 --> 00:12:50.505 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, wow, that's a beautiful
woman in a beautiful setting.

00:12:50.505 --> 00:12:52.130 align:middle line:84%
But then, once you
have the eyes to see

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.546 align:middle line:84%
and you know what
they were trying

00:12:53.546 --> 00:12:55.732 align:middle line:84%
to encode in the painting,
it suddenly comes alive.

00:12:55.732 --> 00:12:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And you're realizing,
hey, wait a minute,

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:84%
they're talking about putting
on the light garment here.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:01.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's the key secret.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.130 align:middle line:84%
It's always about
this beaming garment.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.260 align:middle line:84%
That's what, again, the
Iranian term for it.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.930 align:middle line:84%
They call it the robe of
glory, the shining garment,

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.360 align:middle line:84%
the robe of light,
the robe of sanctity.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.710 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds
of terms for it.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And it may be an actual garment,
but probably, more than likely,

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.980 align:middle line:90%
it's an energy.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a vibration.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Because it symbolized
a Greek word, which

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:26.000 align:middle line:84%
is the word "exousia,"
which means the power,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:84%
sovereignty,
capability, liberty.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have
this light body garment,

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.610 align:middle line:90%
you are a fully sovereign being.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle line:90%
And that's the objective here--

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.550 align:middle line:84%
to achieve this level of
sovereignty, this level

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:42.980 align:middle line:90%
of awakened consciousness.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that that
light garment you're speaking--

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.740 align:middle line:84%
because you're talking about
energetic components here--

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:54.680 align:middle line:84%
is simply the expanded
and refined human aura?

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And it does encompass the aura,
but it even goes beyond that.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they talk about it
manifesting as, literally,

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:05.150 align:middle line:84%
a body of light, called
the rainbow body.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.920 align:middle line:90%
And that's really the key.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's like an extension--
a much more powerful,

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.100 align:middle line:90%
visceral extension beyond that.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And so as we go back into
the story of Jesus as a stargate

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.110 align:middle line:84%
traveler and then into
the story of wormholes--

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.160 align:middle line:84%
essentially portals
or stargates.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're hearing
about this a lot.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's an
interesting being

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:32.671 align:middle line:84%
who's kind come on to the radar
in recent times, an entity that

00:14:32.671 --> 00:14:34.170 align:middle line:84%
brings through a
lot of information.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:35.712 align:middle line:90%
And the being's name is Ion.

00:14:35.712 --> 00:14:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And I just found about
him a couple months ago.

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.920 align:middle line:90%
It's a hoot to listen to--

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.100 align:middle line:84%
interesting information from
someone who sounds like you'd

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:84%
find him down at the barbecue,
somewhere in Tennessee.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.830 align:middle line:90%
And he's just very down home.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.980 align:middle line:84%
But he talks a lot about
stargates and saying,

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.300 align:middle line:90%
what's the problem?

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:90%
Human beings can do this.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.220 align:middle line:90%
They're all over the place.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about
your understanding

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:04.430 align:middle line:84%
about where are they,
other examples, and then

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.980 align:middle line:84%
leading into the story
of Jesus, of interface

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.320 align:middle line:84%
with these, and even
ordinary people, right

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.730 align:middle line:90%
into military Black Ops.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, I define a
stargate on three levels.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:16.160 align:middle line:84%
One, it's the connection
from the heart

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.550 align:middle line:84%
of one sun to the heart of
another sun, or star, or star

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.180 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, it's a place on
earth-- an energetic place--

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:84%
where the energy of a star or
star system rings in the soil--

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:84%
the Temple of Hathor
at Dendera comes

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.790 align:middle line:84%
to mind, which was built for an
alignment with the star Sirius.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So that, literally, during the
dog days, the energy of Sirius

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:84%
just comes right into the front
door of that temple, right

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.720 align:middle line:84%
into the Hypostyle Hall,
and then into the sanctuary.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And then Isis
manifests through that.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And so the Great Pyramid is
another good example of that.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Then a third layer of
definition of stargate

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:55.970 align:middle line:84%
is, literally, a
transportation portal,

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:84%
where you can go,
enter a place on Earth,

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and travel to other places
on the planet or other star

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:02.850 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.680 align:middle line:84%
So those are the three
levels of definition

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.320 align:middle line:90%
that I use for a stargate.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Also, I read that one of the
star gates was in the area--

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.420 align:middle line:84%
the ancient city of
Ur in Iran, which

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:21.720 align:middle line:84%
has been cordoned off as now
a US military installation.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>> A very ancient city.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.164 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know if you've
heard that as well,

00:16:26.164 --> 00:16:28.790 align:middle line:84%
but I had heard that that
is an ancient stargate,

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.580 align:middle line:84%
which I found interesting,
considering the military Black

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.610 align:middle line:90%
Ops aspect of this.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:34.100 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they do seem
to have a desire

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.560 align:middle line:90%
to control some of these areas.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And whether or not
it's because there's

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.200 align:middle line:84%
an actual, ancient
stargate device,

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.867 align:middle line:90%
I can't say that for sure.

00:16:43.867 --> 00:16:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you hear?

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's the rumor
you hear from that world,

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:48.470 align:middle line:90%
in terms of stargates?

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:50.765 align:middle line:84%
Because you hear from a
lot of different people.

00:16:50.765 --> 00:16:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I really try to
avoid that story, actually.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is because
it takes it off of us.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.260 align:middle line:84%
It's, oh, well, the Black Ops
guys, they've got this stuff,

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.060 align:middle line:90%
you can't have it.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>> And they can hoard it.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>> And they can hoard it.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.576 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's right.

00:17:05.576 --> 00:17:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you're following
that, you're not looking within

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:84%
yourself to develop yourself
in your own capability.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.650 align:middle line:90%
Because it's within you.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I think anybody that's
talking about Black Ops guys

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.510 align:middle line:84%
with stargates,
that's disinformation.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.060 align:middle line:84%
That's taking you
off the real path

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:24.173 align:middle line:84%
of your own, personal ascension
and what's capable within you.

00:17:24.173 --> 00:17:25.339 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a very good point.

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And so that's kind of
just where I draw the line.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, what I've
seen in the ancient world

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:32.540 align:middle line:84%
is the only way you're getting
through one of these gates

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.850 align:middle line:84%
is as a being of pure
light and pure love.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And I just don't see the US
military or these Black Ops

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.780 align:middle line:90%
people being in that business.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And nobody really has come
out with anything tangible out

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:44.510 align:middle line:90%
of it anyway.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.390 align:middle line:90%
It's all rumor.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:46.190 align:middle line:90%
It's always rumor.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all rumor.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.270 align:middle line:90%
It's all stories.

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:48.070 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet, you have been
in a situation or two where

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.210 align:middle line:84%
you've been maybe only one
degree of separation from these

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:54.947 align:middle line:90%
things actually happening.

00:17:54.947 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about some of that?

00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.410 align:middle line:84%
What does this look like from
a very humanistic perspective?

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>> What the stargates look like?

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:02.773 align:middle line:90%
What it looks like--

00:18:02.773 --> 00:18:04.670 align:middle line:84%
this rainbow body,
this transcending

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:08.090 align:middle line:84%
beyond physical death
without dying, so to speak.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can just
point you to the artwork,

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:13.490 align:middle line:84%
especially the
Tibetan tradition.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And what I've done is say, OK, I
started with this understanding

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.730 align:middle line:84%
that the Tibetans believe
that the human body can be

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:21.790 align:middle line:90%
spun into a vortex of energy.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.260 align:middle line:84%
You can accelerate the
vibration of the body

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.930 align:middle line:84%
until it manifests, ultimately,
as five colored rainbow

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.030 align:middle line:84%
light-- what they
call the rainbow body.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.067 align:middle line:84%
The body dissolves,
leaving behind

00:18:31.067 --> 00:18:32.900 align:middle line:84%
only hair, toe, and
finger nails, which have

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.120 align:middle line:90%
no nerves to be transmuted.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean, think about that--

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.640 align:middle line:84%
this incredibly powerful
teaching that the Tibetans

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.280 align:middle line:84%
have brought forward about
what our body really is.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.040 align:middle line:84%
It's meant to be spun into
this vortex of energy.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.740 align:middle line:84%
By the way, the Tibetans
teach that this is also

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.940 align:middle line:84%
taught in 13 star systems,
including our own.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.830 align:middle line:84%
This teaching did not
originate on earth.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.400 align:middle line:90%
It came from the stars.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:84%
They don't name the star
systems, but we can bet it

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.840 align:middle line:84%
involved Sirius,
Orion, the Pleiades.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.270 align:middle line:84%
That's a very good place
to start, right there.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, that's really a lot
of the deep history of Tibetan

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Buddhism, right?

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:11.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:12.960 align:middle line:90%
This is what it's all about.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.100 align:middle line:90%
And they teach--

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.891 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, they talk
about the star people.

00:19:14.891 --> 00:19:17.744 align:middle line:84%
They have artifacts that were
given to them by star people.

00:19:17.744 --> 00:19:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And they, furthermore,
tell you that the only way

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:23.300 align:middle line:84%
you're getting off this rock is
to achieve this rainbow body,

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.620 align:middle line:84%
the Resurrection body, the
glory body, the light body.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:84%
But what I've done is
say, well, OK, here's

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.260 align:middle line:84%
the Tibetan example of it, well,
then let's just come over here

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.420 align:middle line:90%
to the Christian example.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Why is it, when Jesus is
shown in his resurrected form,

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.920 align:middle line:84%
in his glory body, he's
always got rainbows around him

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.780 align:middle line:90%
or he's sitting on a rainbow?

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's because I believe
he's achieved the rainbow body.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you loop
through to ancient Egypt.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And you look at Osiris and his
tight fitting, white shroud

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.070 align:middle line:90%
called his crossed body.

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:54.390 align:middle line:84%
He's got all this energetic
stuff going on up here.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.190 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:59.000 align:middle line:84%
It matches the way the
Tibetans show the rainbow body.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.560 align:middle line:84%
So they call it
different things,

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.814 align:middle line:84%
but they're all talking
about the same thing.

00:20:03.814 --> 00:20:06.230 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about beings
who have come to this planet,

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:84%
and given us this teaching,
and have tried to nurture it,

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and to get it to be
kind of the accepted

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.380 align:middle line:90%
reality on this planet.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.410 align:middle line:90%
This is why we're here--

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:18.500 align:middle line:90%
to ultimately learn to ascend.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's talk about
how you see that.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.215 align:middle line:84%
After having
examined all of this,

00:20:22.215 --> 00:20:23.840 align:middle line:84%
when you're looking
at-- you're looking

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.800 align:middle line:84%
at beings, who, as I'm
understanding your work,

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:84%
have come through from
another dimensional field

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:84%
into this one at critical
periods of history

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.760 align:middle line:84%
to help us realign
with some higher truths

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.300 align:middle line:84%
for our own benefit in our
own journey back, right?

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that, more or less--

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:44.710 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's it.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:48.260 align:middle line:90%


00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.240 align:middle line:84%
At least from the
perspective of the research

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.370 align:middle line:84%
I did for "The Secret of
Sion," it almost appears

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:53.640 align:middle line:90%
to be a rescue mission.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, they're
not here for gold.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:58.010 align:middle line:90%
They're not here for gold.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>> They're not
here for gold, OK?

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.400 align:middle line:90%
They're here for souls.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:07.080 align:middle line:84%
They're here to help souls leave
this plane, this dimension.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And the way we do it
is through our body--

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.000 align:middle line:84%
by being in a body, and
being able to access

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.210 align:middle line:84%
the capability of the body to
spin itself into this vortex,

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.030 align:middle line:90%
and to open wormholes.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So now let's talk about it
on a little more personal level.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:84%
You've spent many years
studying all of this.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:27.556 align:middle line:84%
You have a particular
kind of vibrancy about you

00:21:27.556 --> 00:21:29.430 align:middle line:84%
that most people recognize
when they see you.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, well thank you.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>> You do.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And people comment
on it, you know?

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And you're well
respected in this field.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So I have to wonder,
have you, personally,

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.760 align:middle line:84%
been integrating
this information?

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.540 align:middle line:84%
What do you feel has been
driving you all this time?

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, what kind
of practice, if you

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.420 align:middle line:84%
want to call it a
practice, are you

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.180 align:middle line:84%
doing that is starting to
match into this energy?

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I work with
this artwork every day.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:58.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm staring at it constantly.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:59.620 align:middle line:90%
I have it on my phone.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.750 align:middle line:90%
I have it on my computer.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:02.620 align:middle line:90%
I have it all over my home.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.420 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.711 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what they tell
you you're supposed to do

00:22:05.711 --> 00:22:07.440 align:middle line:90%
is meditate on this artwork.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.590 align:middle line:90%
It literally is a meditation.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:12.130 align:middle line:84%
It's open eye
visualization or open eye

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:16.730 align:middle line:84%
meditation with the energy
kind of flowing through it.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe if I'm spending
hours every day interacting

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.922 align:middle line:84%
with this artwork,
and I'm teaching it,

00:22:23.922 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking to
people about it,

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.671 align:middle line:90%
it has to have an effect on me.

00:22:26.671 --> 00:22:28.310 align:middle line:90%
That would be common sense.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And all I can report is,
anecdotally, people tell me--

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.650 align:middle line:84%
the sensitive types,
who "can see"-- say,

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:84%
hey, we really see this energy
starting to come through you.

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And that makes me feel
great because it tells me,

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.890 align:middle line:84%
hey, what these ancient people
were teaching is actually--

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:45.990 align:middle line:90%
it's true.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.750 align:middle line:90%
And anybody can experience this.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And people have
been fairly willing--

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.158 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people that have been
exploring eastern traditions,

00:22:53.158 --> 00:22:56.100 align:middle line:84%
in particular have been
fairly willing to explore

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.260 align:middle line:84%
the same notion with
mandalas, for example.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.420 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So essentially, you're
saying that this art that these

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.100 align:middle line:84%
visionary artists brought
through is the same

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:06.900 align:middle line:90%
as a mandala.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what it is.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.630 align:middle line:84%
It's fully encoded
with the instructions.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.070 align:middle line:84%
The images themselves
will show you the way.

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.695 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to imprint
on your energy field.

00:23:15.695 --> 00:23:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And, at some point,
you become it.

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:22.230 align:middle line:84%
You just sort of reach,
maybe, a saturation point.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
trying to develop is--

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.440 align:middle line:84%
staring at artwork is
one thing, but what else

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.790 align:middle line:90%
can you do, in addition?

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.470 align:middle line:90%
And it's really pretty simple.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.320 align:middle line:84%
It's just try to be aligned
with truth as much as possible.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Speak truth, speak your truth.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.404 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole key.

00:23:39.404 --> 00:23:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because,
again, it all goes back

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:44.012 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient Egyptian
concept of the judgment day,

00:23:44.012 --> 00:23:45.970 align:middle line:84%
when your heart is weighed
against the feather.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:50.250 align:middle line:84%
All they wanted to know how
is, how light hearted are you?

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:51.450 align:middle line:90%
Are you a pure person?

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:52.690 align:middle line:90%
This is what it's all about.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is the
only way you're going

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:55.200 align:middle line:90%
to get through that gateway.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is a
really big point.

00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:00.450 align:middle line:84%
So many people, including a lot
of people watching this right

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:07.050 align:middle line:84%
now, are trying so hard to
analyze, and figure it out,

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:10.530 align:middle line:84%
and tiptoe through the
deceptions of the past

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:14.020 align:middle line:84%
that it becomes a journey that's
really not very light hearted.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.650 align:middle line:84%
People become
depressed, overwhelmed,

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:19.860 align:middle line:84%
they become very
heavy, and fearful.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:23.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, unfortunately, when
you open the Pandora's box,

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.700 align:middle line:84%
it seems like that's sort of
the first road people go down.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like an
initiation, isn't it?

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>> It is like an initiation.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about that from the
standpoint of people you know,

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.640 align:middle line:84%
and yourself, and moving
through that journey?

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And give people some
reference points.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, the key is, you
have to trust yourself

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.840 align:middle line:90%
through the whole process.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And part of what I
think helps people--

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it gets back
to that gap thing.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:84%
You're here, all that good
stuff you want is over here,

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.270 align:middle line:84%
but there's no bridge, there's
no rope, there's no ladder,

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:56.460 align:middle line:84%
there's no apparent way
to get across there.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.310 align:middle line:84%
It's that old, Indiana
Jones moment, right?

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Remember in "The Last Crusade,"
Indiana and his father,

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Sean Connery, are racing the
Nazis for the holy grail.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And they get to that temple,
and the Nazis shoot Sean

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Connery, and say,
Indiana, you want to save

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:12.480 align:middle line:90%
your father's life?

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.850 align:middle line:90%
Go get the holy grail.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:16.350 align:middle line:84%
So he goes through
several trials

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:17.790 align:middle line:84%
until he comes to
that place where

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.485 align:middle line:84%
he's on one side of
the gap or precipice

00:25:19.485 --> 00:25:22.867 align:middle line:84%
and the holy grail is
hidden in a cave over here.

00:25:22.867 --> 00:25:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And Indiana gets
there and he realizes

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:27.330 align:middle line:84%
that he can't use his
whip, he can't use his gun,

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:29.550 align:middle line:84%
he can't beat somebody
up, or steal something--

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.080 align:middle line:84%
all the usual ways
he used to get

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.070 align:middle line:90%
what he wanted in those movies.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And what he realizes is he's
got to get out of his head

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.600 align:middle line:84%
because his head can't find
a way to get across there.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And he's got to
go into his heart.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Actually, he's got to unite
the heart and the mind.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is what causes him
to take that first step.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:51.900 align:middle line:84%
But what Indiana had at that
moment is what a lot of people

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:55.630 align:middle line:84%
really need a lot
more of these days--

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:58.150 align:middle line:90%
and that's motivation.

00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:02.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Indiana was literally in
a life and death situation.

00:26:02.532 --> 00:26:04.990 align:middle line:84%
He could have sat there and
thought, you know, the old man,

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:06.160 align:middle line:90%
he's had a good life.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.000 align:middle line:90%
He had a good run.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.120 align:middle line:84%
He was just with that
beautiful Nazi woman

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.410 align:middle line:90%
that I was with, too.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:12.099 align:middle line:90%
Still not sure about that one.

00:26:12.099 --> 00:26:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think I'll just let him
take his chances with the Nazis

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.290 align:middle line:90%
and I'll do what I can.

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:17.730 align:middle line:90%
But he doesn't do that.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.880 align:middle line:84%
He gets motivated
not by the gap,

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.790 align:middle line:84%
he gets motivated by what's
on the other side of the gap--

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:27.540 align:middle line:84%
getting the holy grail and
saving his father's life.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's what motivated
him to take that step.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.280 align:middle line:90%
And that's kind of what we need.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Is we've got that--

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's what's
motivating you.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.478 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what's on the
other side of the gap?

00:26:37.478 --> 00:26:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, OK, life in
eternity as a star being

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.400 align:middle line:84%
traveling all these
stargates that

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.000 align:middle line:90%
link all these star systems.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it sounds like, wow,
really totally woo, woo.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:49.452 align:middle line:84%
But this is what the
ancient Egyptians

00:26:49.452 --> 00:26:51.660 align:middle line:84%
were teaching, this is what
the Sumerians were about,

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.640 align:middle line:84%
this is what the
Tibetans are about.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And esoteric Christianity
says the same thing.

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:57.810 align:middle line:90%
That's the real world.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.942 align:middle line:84%
This is the Hollywood movie
set that we're in, here.

00:27:00.942 --> 00:27:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're all the
players and we're

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.060 align:middle line:84%
trying to work our
way out of this story.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And we've been playing
very limited roles,

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:10.800 align:middle line:84%
with limited understanding,
with blinders on, so to speak.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's not all our
fault. I mean, part of it

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.260 align:middle line:90%
is it's a cosmic time clock.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.180 align:middle line:84%
As our sun and
solar system makes

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.727 align:middle line:84%
the orbit of the
galactic center,

00:27:19.727 --> 00:27:21.810 align:middle line:84%
we go through these periods
of light and darkness.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, fortunately, we're
entering a period of light here

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:27.969 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we're starting
to shine in this way.

00:27:27.969 --> 00:27:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>> In your presentation-- and
I mentioned it at the beginning

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.160 align:middle line:90%
of this interview--

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.300 align:middle line:84%
there is a powerful
energy emanating.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And the colors of
the NASA imagery

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.610 align:middle line:84%
of the energies
that are emanating

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:43.320 align:middle line:84%
from the galactic center,
these are the most--

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.300 align:middle line:84%
at least within the
visible spectrum--

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.690 align:middle line:84%
and we have to understand there
are dimensions of color beyond

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:50.370 align:middle line:84%
from what our little
eyes can pick up--

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.390 align:middle line:84%
they're the most
sublime colors that

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:54.655 align:middle line:84%
take us into the ultimate
areas of ourselves.

00:27:54.655 --> 00:27:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>> You're talking the
purples, pinks, and fuchsias.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Violets.

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:57.690 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:58.860 align:middle line:90%
The violets.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm blown away by that, what
a simple observation that.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not like an
icky, grey, pea green.

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>> In which case, I
don't want to go there.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.413 align:middle line:90%
Here's the center of our galaxy.

00:28:08.413 --> 00:28:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Look, it's
spectacularly beautiful.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>> And we're moving into that.

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:14.614 align:middle line:90%
We're aligning with it.

00:28:14.614 --> 00:28:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>> We're aligning with that.

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.530 align:middle line:90%
It used to be--

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:20.820 align:middle line:84%
as we know, we thought the sun
was the center of the universe.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Or at least the church
wanted us to believe that.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we refute
that and now we're

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.050 align:middle line:84%
starting to orient
ourselves towards the center

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:27.850 align:middle line:90%
of the galaxy.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
profound shift for us

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.190 align:middle line:84%
because, to me, it
represents a huge expansion

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:33.120 align:middle line:90%
in our consciousness.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.211 align:middle line:84%
As we start to align with
that galactic center,

00:28:36.211 --> 00:28:38.460 align:middle line:84%
then we can start harmonizing
with the energies coming

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.745 align:middle line:90%
from that place as well.

00:28:39.745 --> 00:28:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's talk
about you, personally.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.090 align:middle line:84%
You've been looking at these
iconic works for a long time

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:44.890 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And most of them that you
look at and interface with

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:48.930 align:middle line:90%
are in your book, I take it?

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:51.934 align:middle line:84%
"The Secret of
Sion," to me, is kind

00:28:51.934 --> 00:28:53.100 align:middle line:90%
of a portfolio of all of it.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>> That's kind of the
catalogue of all of it.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>> It's taken years
to collect those,

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:58.540 align:middle line:84%
to go take the pictures myself,
or find them in the museums,

00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:59.340 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the best of the best
of this ascension art

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.480 align:middle line:90%
that I've been able to find.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what have you
felt within your own being?

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Before we get onto
some of those pieces,

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:11.304 align:middle line:84%
what if you felt within your
own being in this journey?

00:29:11.304 --> 00:29:12.720 align:middle line:84%
How long have you
been doing this?

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.130 align:middle line:90%
And what are you feeling?

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, I started
my research quest in 1982,

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.970 align:middle line:84%
I started publishing in 1996,
and then really began working

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:23.430 align:middle line:84%
with the ascension and
transfiguration artwork

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:26.760 align:middle line:90%
and icons about five years ago.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And I definitely notice
a lightening of my energy

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and just my kind of
sense of humor, really.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what I
noticed about you, too.

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Because we're at
a conference here,

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.540 align:middle line:84%
right now, at The
Conscious Life Expo,

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.980 align:middle line:84%
but you're going to be on
an Ancient Aliens panel,

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.200 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be a lot
of fearful stuff thrown

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.510 align:middle line:84%
in there by various
people, but you always

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:53.010 align:middle line:84%
bring through everything in a
very sane and lighthearted way.

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:56.462 align:middle line:84%
>> And you feel different
than a lot of the speakers.

00:29:56.462 --> 00:29:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, well, thank you.

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, there are some other
beautiful beings here, too.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:29:59.550 align:middle line:90%
Gregg Braden's here.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:00.205 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, of course.

00:30:00.205 --> 00:30:00.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:00.870 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:02.203 align:middle line:90%
But do you know what I'm saying?

00:30:02.203 --> 00:30:04.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's what I'm saying
is what you say is very

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:06.890 align:middle line:90%
evident in being around you.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.725 align:middle line:84%
And so this lightness
of being is--

00:30:09.725 --> 00:30:12.420 align:middle line:84%
and this is really,
to me, critical--

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.270 align:middle line:84%
if you can find that
lightening of being inside,

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:19.720 align:middle line:84%
it, essentially, takes all
that incredible constriction

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.540 align:middle line:84%
that is happening in
the physical body,

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and in our electrical field,
even out into the auric field,

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:27.700 align:middle line:84%
it starts freeing
it, doesn't it?

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it does.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.300 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And it, obviously, I mean,
makes you more compassionate.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Part of the stargate metaphysics
is that, automatically, you're

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:39.210 align:middle line:84%
feeling more connected with
everybody that you encounter.

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:42.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a huge aspect
of this-- the oneness.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.007 align:middle line:84%
We're all in the
one ring together.

00:30:44.007 --> 00:30:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're experiencing
that, personally,

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.131 align:middle line:90%
as you go through this journey?

00:30:47.131 --> 00:30:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:51.310 align:middle line:90%
Because I know I've got help.

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:54.360 align:middle line:84%
I know there are these
immaterial light beings that

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.240 align:middle line:84%
are there, assisting,
cheering, routing.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.879 align:middle line:84%
>> For every person
on this planet.

00:30:58.879 --> 00:31:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>> For everybody on the planet.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And I know, beyond a shadow
of a doubt, that they're real.

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And so to be able to share
that message for people,

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:09.680 align:middle line:90%
just really is what drives me.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Has this opened up your
vision to where you can see

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.040 align:middle line:84%
somewhat into these other
dimensions now a bit?

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.910 align:middle line:84%
I've never been a seer
or anything like that.

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
feelers, knowers.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.830 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
knowers, who just know.

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:23.110 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.700 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm probably more in
the knower sort of category.

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.800 align:middle line:90%
So it's opened up your knowing.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:28.646 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely.

00:31:28.646 --> 00:31:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's opened
up my heart, too.

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Your sense of truth.

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:32.810 align:middle line:84%
You know truth when
you experience it,

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:33.850 align:middle line:90%
when you encounter it.

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So going back into
some of the imagery--

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.670 align:middle line:90%
gosh, I have the book.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:42.042 align:middle line:90%
It's right out of--

00:31:42.042 --> 00:31:44.250 align:middle line:84%
well, we could stop the
camera and I could go get it,

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:45.675 align:middle line:84%
but let's go for
my memory first.

00:31:45.675 --> 00:31:46.475 align:middle line:90%
The Magi.

00:31:46.475 --> 00:31:49.370 align:middle line:90%


00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:51.680 align:middle line:84%
You spent some time
talking about that

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.930 align:middle line:90%
and the star that guided them.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:53.729 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:53.729 --> 00:31:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And I would love it if you'd
share that with everybody.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.584 align:middle line:84%
The story, "The
Revelation of the Magi"

00:31:58.584 --> 00:32:02.120 align:middle line:84%
was kind of the real power
pack that prompted me

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.040 align:middle line:90%
to write "The Secret of Sion."

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:08.630 align:middle line:84%
I got an email from a trusted
friend a couple of years ago

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and she said, go get a copy of
"The Revelation of the Magi."

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:14.280 align:middle line:84%
It'll be important
to your future work.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.440 align:middle line:90%
So I went and got the book.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.730 align:middle line:90%
It was by Dr. Brett Landau.

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:21.290 align:middle line:84%
He was a Harvard
PhD candidate, who

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.510 align:middle line:84%
had heard about
this sixth century,

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:25.940 align:middle line:84%
gnostic text called "The
Revelation of the Magi"

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.584 align:middle line:84%
that had never been translated
into English before.

00:32:28.584 --> 00:32:29.750 align:middle line:90%
And he though, there you go.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.970 align:middle line:90%
There's my PhD dissertation.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And so he went over
to the Vatican,

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.200 align:middle line:84%
he went into the proverbial
basement of the Vatican,

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:40.430 align:middle line:84%
dug out this Syrian text,
and translated into English.

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it
said three things.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:44.450 align:middle line:84%
It's about the Magi
looking for the Christ

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:47.609 align:middle line:84%
child, which is, we all know,
the story of the three Magi.

00:32:47.609 --> 00:32:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I heard it in Sunday school.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.880 align:middle line:90%
From Sunday school.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.680 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:58.700 align:middle line:84%
But in this version of it, the
Magi are not following a star,

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:02.840 align:middle line:84%
they're following a star
child or a star being,

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.210 align:middle line:90%
who they identify as Jesus.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Jesus manifest before
them in a gateway.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:13.010 align:middle line:84%
What kind of a gateway does
a star child manifest through

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:15.530 align:middle line:90%
but a stargate?

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:18.772 align:middle line:84%
And he identifies himself
as a time traveler,

00:33:18.772 --> 00:33:20.480 align:middle line:84%
saying, hey, what
makes you think this is

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.730 align:middle line:90%
the first time I've been here?

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:25.340 align:middle line:84%
I've been here many times in the
past, many times in the future.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And that book, to me, was
an absolute validation

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.830 align:middle line:84%
of what I concluded
about the story of Jesus

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:33.230 align:middle line:84%
for a long time-- that he
was a stargate traveling

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:34.580 align:middle line:90%
time traveler.

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's the message
that has been lost.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was a clear
message from that.

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:42.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's written
in black and white

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.889 align:middle line:84%
that this is what we're
dealing with here.

00:33:43.889 --> 00:33:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And then on top of it, they talk
about this hallucinogenic star

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:49.380 align:middle line:84%
food that the star
child brings as well.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.410 align:middle line:84%
But that's a whole
other dimension of it.

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Magi go
back to their home,

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:59.970 align:middle line:84%
which they call Shir, in
"The Revelation of the Magi."

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's identified
as an easternmost land

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.520 align:middle line:90%
at the edge of the world.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
some kind of liminal place

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.560 align:middle line:84%
here, maybe another
dimensional world or something,

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.964 align:middle line:84%
that they're saying these
guys are crossing over from.

00:34:11.964 --> 00:34:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And when the star
child manifests,

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.770 align:middle line:84%
he offers to them
this star food.

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And so the Magi go
back to their home.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:21.409 align:middle line:84%
And other people are able to
have visions of the Christ

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:25.699 align:middle line:84%
child, the star child, after
they eat the star food, which

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:28.740 align:middle line:84%
sounds like something way
beyond the monatomic gold

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:29.540 align:middle line:90%
or the manna.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.440 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering if it
was monatomic gold.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.429 align:middle line:90%
It's something beyond this?

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's
something beyond that?

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.071 align:middle line:84%
I think we're talking
about some kind

00:34:35.071 --> 00:34:36.920 align:middle line:84%
of hallucinogenic
substance that they're

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.060 align:middle line:84%
using to produce these
visions and maybe even open

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:39.860 align:middle line:90%
these gateways.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.159 align:middle line:84%
It allowed people to
tap into that field,

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:43.250 align:middle line:90%
that dimensional field.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So I just started pulling on
the string of "The Revelation

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.090 align:middle line:84%
of the Magi" and it
started to really pull

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:51.290 align:middle line:90%
a whole lot together.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And so especially
what it revealed

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:59.910 align:middle line:84%
is that the Magi believed that
they were children of Seth.

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Now again, Sunday school--
we know about Adam and Eve,

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:06.224 align:middle line:84%
we know about Cain and Abel, we
don't hear so much about Seth.

00:35:06.224 --> 00:35:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>> We don't hear Seth.

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.700 align:middle line:90%
Who's Seth?

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.324 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out
Seth is the one that

00:35:09.324 --> 00:35:11.750 align:middle line:84%
got all of the Enlightenment
teachings from Adam and Eve.

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:13.250 align:middle line:84%
But what are those
teachings about?

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the story, Adam
and Eve were evicted

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:17.180 align:middle line:90%
from the Garden of Eden.

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Yahweh, the Old Testament
god, creates a gate

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:23.870 align:middle line:84%
at the east of Eden, puts
a flashing, revolving sword

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:28.010 align:middle line:84%
in the center of that gate, and
puts cherubim on either side,

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:31.890 align:middle line:84%
and forbids humankind to
return through that gate.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:35.810 align:middle line:84%
A second thing that Yahweh did
that most people forget about

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.876 align:middle line:84%
is he made coats of
skin for Adam and Eve.

00:35:38.876 --> 00:35:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Coats of skin--
what do you mean?

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Like buck skin or cow skin?

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:44.600 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:48.020 align:middle line:84%
In the esoteric
Judeo-Christian tradition,

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:51.050 align:middle line:84%
he's talking about
coats of human skin.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And then the question
arises, well,

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.350 align:middle line:84%
if they didn't have
coats of skin on them

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:55.891 align:middle line:84%
when they were in
the Garden of Eden,

00:35:55.891 --> 00:35:58.940 align:middle line:84%
then form exactly
were Adam and Eve in?

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer provided by
the esoteric Judeo-Christian

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.340 align:middle line:84%
tradition is they
were beings of light.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.080 align:middle line:90%
There were light beings.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was Seth who received
all of the light being teachings

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:11.870 align:middle line:90%
from Adam and Eve.

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's through the line of
Seth that the secrets of this

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:17.800 align:middle line:84%
radiant garment of light--
our true light body--

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.390 align:middle line:90%
was transmitted.

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you follow
that line, you

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:25.960 align:middle line:84%
follow figures like Enoch,
and Noah, and others.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And then ultimately,
they literally

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.720 align:middle line:84%
believe that Jesus was
another incarnation of Seth.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're talking about
inter-dimensional beings.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>> It's ETs.

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.317 align:middle line:90%
>> Jesus is an ET.

00:36:40.317 --> 00:36:42.400 align:middle line:84%
We've seen that bumper
sticker a lot and so forth.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.821 align:middle line:84%
>> But in reality, you're
talking about from another--

00:36:46.821 --> 00:36:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't like saying
higher or lower.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.159 align:middle line:84%
There's no good,
bad, high, or low.

00:36:50.159 --> 00:36:51.700 align:middle line:84%
It's just another
dimensional field--

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Another realm.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>> That has a certain amount
of knowledge that we can value.

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And the tip off for that--
in the Jesus story, anyway--

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:03.160 align:middle line:84%
is the number of times
that the heavens opened.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.410 align:middle line:84%
The heavens opened at
the baptism of Jesus,

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:08.110 align:middle line:84%
the heavens opened at the
crucifixion, the heavens opened

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:10.230 align:middle line:90%
at the Resurrection.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And what do you mean
the heavens open?

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:16.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when he appeared to
Paul on the road to Damascus,

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Paul described, suddenly,
everything's flashing around me

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and then here's
this light being.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:25.040 align:middle line:84%
"The Secret Book of John"
describes a similar type

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:25.840 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.230 align:middle line:84%
John is out in
middle of the desert.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:28.771 align:middle line:84%
He says, the heavens
open, and here's

00:37:28.771 --> 00:37:31.030 align:middle line:84%
this light being in front
of me, and it's Jesus.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, today, we don't talk
about the heavens opening,

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.980 align:middle line:84%
we talk about stargates,
and wormholes,

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and ripping holes in the
fabric of space time,

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:40.147 align:middle line:90%
traveling inner dimensionally.

00:37:40.147 --> 00:37:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And when looked at it
from that perspective,

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.990 align:middle line:84%
it's crystal clear
that we're dealing

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:48.550 align:middle line:84%
with inter-dimensional beings
here, who flash, appear, flash,

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:49.810 align:middle line:90%
they disappear.

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:51.830 align:middle line:84%
They can materialize
in human form.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.130 align:middle line:84%
They can eat, they
can make love,

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:56.220 align:middle line:84%
they can do all kinds
of things, then flash--

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.714 align:middle line:90%
they're out of here again.

00:37:57.714 --> 00:38:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll tell you what-- the
trippiest experience I've ever

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:04.840 align:middle line:84%
had in my entire life was in the
cave that John the Baptist is

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.400 align:middle line:84%
said to have done a lot of his
journey work in, at Ein Karem.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my gosh.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Outside of Jerusalem.

00:38:09.025 --> 00:38:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.093 align:middle line:90%
>> You wander through the hills.

00:38:11.093 --> 00:38:13.840 align:middle line:84%
You can see, that was quite a
journey on a donkey or on foot,

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:16.000 align:middle line:90%
down into Jerusalem.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.840 align:middle line:90%
But you talk about a cast of--

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.620 align:middle line:84%
because I do see
things, you know?

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:21.470 align:middle line:90%
Not crazy.

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And what a show of characters
that show up in that cave.

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And if I had that
experience-- many people

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.860 align:middle line:90%
are having that experience.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was fascinating in the
historical perspective of it

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:34.390 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So that gave me a little
extra credibility to John

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:45.610 align:middle line:84%
the Baptist's wanderings in the
desert and his hallucinations

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:48.760 align:middle line:84%
because I was not on anything,
and I was not hallucinating

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.830 align:middle line:84%
when I was in that
cave, and it was showing

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:52.450 align:middle line:90%
a cast of Egyptian characters.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:55.010 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of characters
were showing up in there.

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:55.640 align:middle line:90%
No kidding.

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:55.926 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:55.926 --> 00:38:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.580 align:middle line:90%
So

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>> But again, these are
inter-dimensional beings.

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Even there, in my experience,
those were inter-dimensional

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.080 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And so when we're looking at
this whole subject of interface

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:10.780 align:middle line:84%
with inter-dimensional beings,
where's the crossover point

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.510 align:middle line:84%
that we start understanding
we, ourselves,

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:17.160 align:middle line:90%
are multidimensional beings?

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Where does that
interface with it?

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:19.660 align:middle line:90%
That's the good question.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just,
at some point,

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.410 align:middle line:84%
it gets back to the gap,
where you're saying,

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:28.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is who I truly am,
and I have a higher self that's

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.850 align:middle line:84%
guiding me on this
path, and I just

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:32.625 align:middle line:90%
have to trust that this is--

00:39:32.625 --> 00:39:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>> We already know that
other part can do miracles.

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>> They're reported
in the news even.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:38.120 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that the human
being is capable of miracles,

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.190 align:middle line:84%
so one would have to say,
these aren't actually miracles,

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:44.620 align:middle line:84%
these are just what we're
capable of, but, normally,

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.777 align:middle line:84%
under more extreme
pressured situations.

00:39:47.777 --> 00:39:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, it's a
simplistic metaphor,

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.901 align:middle line:84%
but getting back to
the caterpillar--

00:39:50.901 --> 00:39:53.170 align:middle line:84%
we're all identifying
ourselves as the caterpillars

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:56.030 align:middle line:84%
and we've got to put our
emphasis on our butterfly

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.830 align:middle line:90%
selves.

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:58.496 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
trying to flesh out.

00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:01.210 align:middle line:84%
What is a fully
functioning human being?

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:05.920 align:middle line:84%
What is a fully
manifested human being?

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.060 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's a light being.

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.330 align:middle line:84%
It's an inter-dimensional
time traveler.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet all
this is happening.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:14.320 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like we have
a polarization of belief

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.160 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.356 align:middle line:90%
Because all of this--

00:40:16.356 --> 00:40:17.980 align:middle line:84%
there are people
attracted to your work

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:21.430 align:middle line:84%
and attracted to these messages
that things are changing

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:22.790 align:middle line:90%
and it's a good thing.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>> For every person that's in
that mind, we have one, or two,

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:29.920 align:middle line:84%
or three, or 10 people that
have gone down the rabbit hole

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.370 align:middle line:90%
of fear, of Armageddon.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Revelations, 2012.

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:35.650 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:36.720 align:middle line:90%
And the new one--

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.617 align:middle line:84%
I call it the
ascension deception.

00:40:38.617 --> 00:40:40.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are those
that are out there saying,

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.700 align:middle line:84%
hey, if you're following
the love and light path

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and the path of
ascension, guess what?

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.660 align:middle line:90%
That's a trap.

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:49.480 align:middle line:84%
These are some negative
ETs that have come in here

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.310 align:middle line:90%
and put this teaching here.

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you follow that path,
they're going to get you.

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:57.585 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, I
just can't go there.

00:40:57.585 --> 00:40:58.810 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I can't see it.

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:03.540 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's a lot of
dysfunction among "the gods."

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:05.160 align:middle line:90%
Same as here.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Same as here.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>> It's throughout the cosmos.

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:10.350 align:middle line:84%
But I still think that,
clearly, the love and light

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:14.110 align:middle line:90%
path is the one to follow.

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And again, the only way
you can go there or you can

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:21.540 align:middle line:84%
identify it really has to be
through our finer feelings.

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:22.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what you've been
really refining in yourself,

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:28.860 align:middle line:90%
is your ability to--

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.950 align:middle line:84%
and I've been working on the
same thing, for many years--

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.930 align:middle line:84%
feel your way into
what is truth.

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>> It's certainly truth for
you, at that moment in time.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And also, I mean,
we are antennas

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.390 align:middle line:84%
and we want to put ourselves
in the clearest place

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:47.250 align:middle line:84%
to receive these
higher energies coming

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:50.230 align:middle line:84%
from the center of the galaxy,
which is a huge part of it.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why the
clarity becomes so important.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.790 align:middle line:90%
And I call it the truth ray.

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:58.060 align:middle line:90%
We see it all the time.

00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we seem to be living
in a time-- or, at least,

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:03.527 align:middle line:84%
I believe we're living
in a time that--

00:42:03.527 --> 00:42:05.860 align:middle line:84%
it's uncomfortable for some
people to think about this--

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:07.680 align:middle line:84%
but if you've got secrets,
this is the time when they're

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.190 align:middle line:90%
going to be coming up and out.

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:09.660 align:middle line:90%
Oops.

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Oops.

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>> This is Revelations.

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>> This is it.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a time purification.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And that gets
uncomfortable, Joe Paterno.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.294 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, that's a good
example of a recent person.

00:42:19.294 --> 00:42:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>> He had to check
out right after that.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.140 align:middle line:90%
It was too much for his being.

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>> It was too much.

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:22.890 align:middle line:90%
Don't

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>> He died right after.

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:27.534 align:middle line:84%
Very, very sad,
but an example of--

00:42:27.534 --> 00:42:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>> He couldn't hold the
negativity and the deception

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:30.680 align:middle line:90%
in any longer.

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:30.920 align:middle line:90%
It killed him.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:31.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:32.290 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.390 align:middle line:84%
So now you have these beautiful
images that you look at.

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:39.552 align:middle line:84%
And let me ask you, what
are a few of your favorites

00:42:39.552 --> 00:42:41.010 align:middle line:84%
that are in the
book, that you feel

00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:42.630 align:middle line:90%
are some of the most powerful?

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And also, besides
the book, which

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:50.130 align:middle line:84%
has nice sized versions
of it, are there

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:53.460 align:middle line:84%
any kind of museum posters
and such that people

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:54.990 align:middle line:90%
can get their hands on?

00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:56.087 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:42:56.087 --> 00:42:56.980 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:57.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.160 align:middle line:90%
It's tough.

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>> So use the book.

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Use the book.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, they
can use the book.

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:01.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot cheaper, too.

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, the
book's full color.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.310 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>> You can get a couple
of copies and cut them up.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:06.796 align:middle line:90%
That's what people do.

00:43:06.796 --> 00:43:08.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they are almost
suitable for framing.

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:09.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.830 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I encourage that.

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I have digital versions
of it available, too,

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.980 align:middle line:90%
that you can take to FedEx.

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:16.620 align:middle line:90%
FedEx.

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>> And print them out.

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:22.170 align:middle line:84%
But part of the
challenge of our time--

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:24.750 align:middle line:84%
we're living in such an
image sensitive world--

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:27.450 align:middle line:84%
is, how do these museums
control this stuff?

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to get one out of the
J.P. Morgan museum in New York

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:31.740 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:32.827 align:middle line:90%
It's like pulling teeth.

00:43:32.827 --> 00:43:33.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's unreal.

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:34.964 align:middle line:90%
>> Just to license it?

00:43:34.964 --> 00:43:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Just to license it.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:36.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:36.720 align:middle line:90%
To share it.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>> To share it.

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Which one is it, in
case anyone's near there?

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:41.760 align:middle line:90%
Don't tell us.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.490 align:middle line:84%
We'll let you go through your
thing and then let us know.

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And so this is
what I go through.

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:48.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you got to
negotiate with the museums,

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:49.530 align:middle line:84%
you got to license it, or
you've got to get there

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:51.070 align:middle line:84%
and you take the
picture yourself.

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So this is part of
the service that I

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:55.440 align:middle line:84%
feel like I'm providing by
doing this-- it's finding it,

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and here it is, and then
putting it into a format

00:43:58.350 --> 00:43:59.760 align:middle line:90%
that people can use.

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And like I say, if you get
the e-book version of it,

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.640 align:middle line:84%
you can cut, and paste,
and put it on your--

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Screen saver.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>> On your screen saver.

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:10.102 align:middle line:90%
You can put it on your phone.

00:44:10.102 --> 00:44:11.310 align:middle line:90%
All of those kinds of things.

00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, very cool.

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:13.420 align:middle line:90%
That's a great way to use it.

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:16.410 align:middle line:84%
So what are, say, the top
three that people feed back

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:18.770 align:middle line:84%
to you that they're having
a lot of experiences with?

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, especially any of
the transfiguration images

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:21.810 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:23.820 align:middle line:84%
These are the ones where he's
up on the top of the mountain

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:25.320 align:middle line:84%
in the bright white
garment of white

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:26.910 align:middle line:84%
with the open
gateway behind him.

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:29.760 align:middle line:90%
Those are really special ones.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Also, I, personally, love the
Tibetan rainbow body images.

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And I've got several
of those in the book

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and then also on my
website, williamhenry.net.

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.889 align:middle line:84%
You can just get
lost in these images.

00:44:42.889 --> 00:44:44.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you really
see this swirling,

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:46.980 align:middle line:90%
the vortex of the rainbow body.

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And it just does-- it
just beams energy to you

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.050 align:middle line:90%
every time you look at them.

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:54.660 align:middle line:84%
So those are really
the key ones.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:58.409 align:middle line:84%
What people tell me, though,
is that a lot of people

00:44:58.409 --> 00:45:00.450 align:middle line:84%
grew up in the church,
and they see this artwork,

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:02.670 align:middle line:84%
and they're taught to be afraid
of it, and this sort of thing,

00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:04.795 align:middle line:84%
and what they tell me is
that I've kind of given it

00:45:04.795 --> 00:45:08.480 align:middle line:84%
back to them in a
much lighter format,

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.551 align:middle line:84%
where now they can
actually access it.

00:45:10.551 --> 00:45:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And now they start
studying it themselves.

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And that makes it
really exciting.

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:15.511 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there a lot of
people that were not raised

00:45:15.511 --> 00:45:19.680 align:middle line:84%
in the Judeo-Christian
system, religions?

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And they're still
comfortable with it?

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, sure.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:22.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:23.420 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>> This is going out on
a purely energetic level,

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:28.150 align:middle line:84%
so it's not like it requires
any previous belief systems.

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it doesn't it.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:30.270 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:32.480 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the energy is very pure.

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:33.331 align:middle line:90%
That's what I found.

00:45:33.331 --> 00:45:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Because the artists would go
into deep states of meditation.

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:37.080 align:middle line:90%
It's obvious.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Set the intention before
they would create this.

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was meant, really,
to be a fast track

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.261 align:middle line:90%
light to this divine energy.

00:45:45.261 --> 00:45:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Besides what you just said
a minute ago about the various

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.400 align:middle line:84%
traps people are falling
into, we're at a conference

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and there's every kind
of speaker under the sun.

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Half of it's on 2012
and the coming changes.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of thoughts around
that that you'd like to share?

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, I still
hold high hopes for 2012.

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Now that it's here, it's
kind of semi anti-climactic.

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good thing.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.162 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good thing.

00:46:15.162 --> 00:46:17.620 align:middle line:84%
As we've entered into it, it's
like, OK, so now we're here,

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:18.550 align:middle line:90%
now what?

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.730 align:middle line:84%
But you're feeling
the intensification

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:22.630 align:middle line:90%
of the energies?

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, without a doubt.

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Big time.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:24.690 align:middle line:90%
Without a doubt.

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And even in the work
of John Major Jenkins,

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:32.710 align:middle line:84%
he's saying this period of time,
even according to the Mayans,

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:36.910 align:middle line:84%
wasn't on the eve of
December 21st, 2012,

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:41.110 align:middle line:84%
this is over decades leading up
to and a few years following.

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:46.800 align:middle line:84%
What I've been doing and
what I've always done,

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:51.100 align:middle line:84%
in regards to 2012, is just
study the symbolism of it.

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:54.509 align:middle line:84%
And you have the
cosmic alignment,

00:46:54.509 --> 00:46:56.800 align:middle line:84%
the galactic alignment, which
they call the sacred tree

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.210 align:middle line:90%
or the cosmic cross--

00:46:58.210 --> 00:46:59.960 align:middle line:90%
the tree of life.

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Then they talk about an opening
in the center of the galaxy,

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:08.350 align:middle line:84%
out of which a serpent rope
emerges with Quetzalcoatl,

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:10.300 align:middle line:84%
the Mayan savior,
riding upon this.

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And John Jenkins first
suggested that that

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.200 align:middle line:90%
could, in fact, be a wormhole.

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.420 align:middle line:90%
But when he said that, back in--

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:18.040 align:middle line:84%
gosh, I've been
talking with John

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:21.500 align:middle line:90%
about this since 2001, 2002.

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.300 align:middle line:90%
10 years.

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:24.569 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:47:24.569 --> 00:47:26.110 align:middle line:84%
The idea of the
stargate and wormhole

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:29.930 align:middle line:84%
really wasn't all over the
place, like it is today.

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And I see that as an important
manifestation of the whole 2012

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:36.730 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon, that, yes,
this is the next step.

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing
it in commercials.

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I've been putting
this on my v-blog.

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Any time Verizon puts
out a new commercial,

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:46.840 align:middle line:84%
they've got the six arm
goddess with the phone,

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.475 align:middle line:90%
with the stargate behind her.

00:47:48.475 --> 00:47:49.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:49.275 --> 00:47:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Friskies cat food.

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Now they've got
Puss in Boots comes,

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:54.070 align:middle line:84%
he opens up the
rainbow ring, the cat

00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:56.826 align:middle line:84%
goes into the other dimensional
world, has the Friskies,

00:47:56.826 --> 00:47:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and then comes back
through the rainbow ring.

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:00.304 align:middle line:84%
It's like, there
it is, right there.

00:48:00.304 --> 00:48:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>> We should be getting
comfortable with the notions

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:04.679 align:middle line:84%
of wormholes, stargates,
and other dimensions by now.

00:48:04.679 --> 00:48:05.478 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:48:05.478 --> 00:48:06.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's in our commercial.

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>> And time traveling.

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:09.340 align:middle line:90%
It's in the movies, TVs.

00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:10.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's all
over the place now.

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And I see that-- that is a
really important kind of--

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:16.120 align:middle line:84%
put a check beside that one
because that's certainly

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.140 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, other than encouraging
people to pick up this book,

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:23.554 align:middle line:84%
which is-- like I said to
begin with, this is stunning.

00:48:23.554 --> 00:48:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Congratulations on the amount
of effort you put into this.

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>> It's beautiful.

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And I make take mine
and start cutting it up.

00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:29.636 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:48:29.636 --> 00:48:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>> I hope you do.

00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And see about it reflecting
on some of those images myself.

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Other than this, any
final words you'd

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.620 align:middle line:90%
like to share with people?

00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Just as I said earlier,
this is the time of truth.

00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And as much as possible,
speak truth, OK?

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:47.520 align:middle line:90%


00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.930 align:middle line:90%
At least this way I look at it--

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:52.480 align:middle line:84%
I think that the center
of the galaxy, based

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.220 align:middle line:84%
on the study I did
and the research I

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:55.870 align:middle line:84%
did for "The Secret
of Sion," I think

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:58.829 align:middle line:84%
that's where the throne
of God is located.

00:48:58.829 --> 00:49:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And so here are the
Mayans telling us

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:02.290 align:middle line:84%
we are in this rare
and special time,

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:04.820 align:middle line:84%
experiencing this alignment
with the center of the galaxy.

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you think of yourself
as standing, right now,

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:10.540 align:middle line:84%
before the throne of God and
everybody you talk to you

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:14.217 align:middle line:84%
is a manifestation of God,
how are you going to behave,

00:49:14.217 --> 00:49:15.550 align:middle line:90%
when you're standing before God?

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Are you going to lie?

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to be playing
tricks, and games, and all

00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:20.410 align:middle line:90%
of this?

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:21.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And that, I think, is what
I encourage people to do.

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Look in everybody's
eyes, and see

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:28.369 align:middle line:84%
that everybody is an expression
or a manifestation of God,

00:49:28.369 --> 00:49:30.160 align:middle line:84%
and how are you going
to behave when you're

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.540 align:middle line:90%
in front of the face of God?

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:33.937 align:middle line:84%
That's how we need to
be living at this time.

00:49:33.937 --> 00:49:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And maybe we need to send a
couple of copies to Wall Street

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.180 align:middle line:90%
and Capitol Hill.

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much, William.

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you very much.

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:43.568 align:middle line:90%
>> Pleasure, as always.

00:49:43.568 --> 00:49:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you,
everybody, for listening.

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.950 align:middle line:84%
