1
00:00:01.929 --> 00:00:04.669
<v ->You're about to meet the real X-Files guy.</v>

2
00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:06.369
His name is Russel Targ.

3
00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:08.489
Educated as a laser physicist,

4
00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:10.569
Russel's life took an interesting turn

5
00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:13.249
when he began his work for the famed SRI,

6
00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:15.149
Stanford Research Institute.

7
00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:18.429
He was the man who trained CIA spies to remote view

8
00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.389
into the military secrets, events, and strategies

9
00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:24.689
of the former Soviet Union, China, and other countries,

10
00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.649
which included viewing into the future.

11
00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:29.894
When all of the high intrigue had passed, however,

12
00:00:29.894 --> 00:00:33.534
he discovered that what mattered most was what he developed

13
00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:35.554
deep within himself from all those years

14
00:00:35.554 --> 00:00:38.554
sitting in the dark with spies in training,

15
00:00:38.554 --> 00:00:42.394
that of the journey inward to our true nature.

16
00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:50.122 line:15% 
Last time I interviewed you was 1984,

17
00:00:50.122 --> 00:00:52.802
when you're doing an experiment on remote viewing

18
00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:55.102
with the group in the Soviet Union,

19
00:00:55.102 --> 00:00:58.162
including the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

20
00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:00.462
Can you talk a little bit about those days

21
00:01:00.462 --> 00:01:03.522
at Stanford Research Institute and what you were doing

22
00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:07.102
as a psychic spy, the real X-Files, that is,

23
00:01:07.102 --> 00:01:08.342
but you are.

24
00:01:08.342 --> 00:01:11.682
<v ->Well, the work we did at SRI was the real X-Files,</v>

25
00:01:11.682 --> 00:01:13.822
because we were employed by the CIA

26
00:01:13.822 --> 00:01:16.302
and Defence Intelligence Agency

27
00:01:16.302 --> 00:01:20.202
to exactly teach their people how to get in touch

28
00:01:20.202 --> 00:01:23.582
with the part of themselves that's psychic, so that they

29
00:01:23.582 --> 00:01:27.942
and we could describe and experience what's going on

30
00:01:27.942 --> 00:01:29.882
in distant places, like China,

31
00:01:29.882 --> 00:01:32.282
and the Soviet Union, and so forth.

32
00:01:32.282 --> 00:01:37.162
We had a program at SRI for 25 years, supported by all

33
00:01:37.162 --> 00:01:41.622
of the government agencies dealing with intelligence,

34
00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:45.462
CIA, Defence Intelligence Agency, army intelligence,

35
00:01:45.462 --> 00:01:48.782
the Airforce, Navy, NASA,

36
00:01:48.782 --> 00:01:51.382
all of the alphabet groups

37
00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:54.820
supported us and we had more than 20 million dollar support

38
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.820
for those two decades to do applications for the government.

39
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.440
One of the best evidences for the existence

40
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.080
of psychic functioning is that we were able

41
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.220
to get our program renewed year after year.

42
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.800
Even if you're doing straight electrical engineering,

43
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.740
it's very hard to get two years in a row

44
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.180
to complete a program, let alone get 25 years

45
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.240
to carry on work.

46
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Regina>But clearly they were understanding</v>

47
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.280
the value of this information, even though

48
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.500
at that time, much of it--

49
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.740
You wrote a book with Keith Harary,

50
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.850
called the Mind Race, that I read back then

51
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.800
before interviewing you and this was some pretty wild stuff,

52
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.858
using non-local awareness, which we're now going

53
00:02:37.858 --> 00:02:39.298
to be talking about in a little bit

54
00:02:39.298 --> 00:02:42.718
through a different lens, but using this for purposes

55
00:02:42.718 --> 00:02:45.538
such as remote strangulation experiments

56
00:02:45.538 --> 00:02:48.118
during the Cold War on the Soviet side--

57
00:02:48.118 --> 00:02:50.158
<v ->We wanna be clear that we were</v>

58
00:02:50.158 --> 00:02:51.578
not doing remote strangulation--

59
00:02:51.578 --> 00:02:52.838
<v Regina>No, no.</v>
<v Russel>at SRI.</v>

60
00:02:52.838 --> 00:02:53.905
<v Regina>No.</v>

61
00:02:53.905 --> 00:02:56.007
You're right, you wrote about some of that phenomenon

62
00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:57.458
on the Soviet side though, right?

63
00:02:57.458 --> 00:03:02.058
<v ->That's right. Our work at SRI was to inflow information</v>

64
00:03:02.058 --> 00:03:05.678
from the distance and even from the future in some cases,

65
00:03:05.678 --> 00:03:08.318
so it was about psychic perception.

66
00:03:08.318 --> 00:03:13.098
The Soviets were interested in remote behavior modification.

67
00:03:13.098 --> 00:03:16.898
Can you have somebody like Nikolayev,

68
00:03:16.898 --> 00:03:20.358
the famous Soviet telepathy person,

69
00:03:20.358 --> 00:03:25.158
can you have him focus his attention on his friend

70
00:03:25.158 --> 00:03:28.218
in Leningrad and change his behavior?

71
00:03:28.218 --> 00:03:32.418
Finally, what Nikolayev decided would really work

72
00:03:32.418 --> 00:03:35.618
is he would just visualize strangling his friend

73
00:03:35.618 --> 00:03:37.018
and that worked.

74
00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:38.638
That caused his breathing to change

75
00:03:38.638 --> 00:03:42.278
and eventually his friend fell off his chair

76
00:03:42.278 --> 00:03:45.518
at University of Leningrad and they had

77
00:03:45.518 --> 00:03:47.238
to stop the experiment.

78
00:03:47.238 --> 00:03:48.738
That's all well documented.

79
00:03:48.738 --> 00:03:50.818
That would be an extreme example

80
00:03:50.818 --> 00:03:52.958
of remote behavior modification.

81
00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.238
<v Regina>But what you were doing is equally</v>

82
00:03:55.238 --> 00:03:56.618
as startling as that.

83
00:03:56.618 --> 00:03:59.978
In fact, I met with you, I think it was the day

84
00:03:59.978 --> 00:04:03.338
before you, and your daughter, and everybody took off

85
00:04:03.338 --> 00:04:07.738
for that experiment with a woman named Juna Davitashvili.

86
00:04:07.738 --> 00:04:08.778
Was that how you pronouced it?

87
00:04:08.778 --> 00:04:09.538
<v ->Davitashvili.</v>

88
00:04:09.538 --> 00:04:10.918
<v Regina>Yeah, something like that (laughing).</v>

89
00:04:10.918 --> 00:04:13.038
The remote viewing experiment you did with her,

90
00:04:13.038 --> 00:04:15.598
now she was Brezhnev's nurse at one time

91
00:04:15.598 --> 00:04:16.438
and did psychic healing.

92
00:04:16.438 --> 00:04:17.778
<v ->That's right, she was a psychic healer.</v>

93
00:04:17.778 --> 00:04:21.218
We chose her because she was well known to be psychic,

94
00:04:21.218 --> 00:04:25.058
but had never done this kind of remote viewing.

95
00:04:25.058 --> 00:04:28.198
We chose not to work with Nikolayev,

96
00:04:28.198 --> 00:04:30.618
the famous telepathy fellow,

97
00:04:30.618 --> 00:04:34.058
because our experience, my daughter

98
00:04:34.058 --> 00:04:37.258
and I had experienced that if people just do

99
00:04:37.258 --> 00:04:40.958
what we tell them, we can push them

100
00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.878
into a very psychic state that will result

101
00:04:43.878 --> 00:04:45.998
in a successful experiment.

102
00:04:45.998 --> 00:04:48.858
Juna had never done anything like this.

103
00:04:48.858 --> 00:04:51.698
We told Juna that we will take responsibility

104
00:04:51.698 --> 00:04:53.178
for this experiment.

105
00:04:53.178 --> 00:04:54.918
The two crazy Americans have come over

106
00:04:54.918 --> 00:04:58.978
with our film crew and with the film crew

107
00:04:58.978 --> 00:05:01.078
from the Soviet Academy of Sciences--

108
00:05:01.078 --> 00:05:02.258
<v Regina>The room was packed.</v>

109
00:05:02.258 --> 00:05:03.907
<v ->That's right.</v>

110
00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:05.797
Were you there?

111
00:05:05.797 --> 00:05:06.577
<v Regina>I saw the film.</v>

112
00:05:06.577 --> 00:05:07.977
I aired it first in the US,

113
00:05:07.977 --> 00:05:09.907
so I remember seeing all of this.

114
00:05:09.907 --> 00:05:13.610
<v ->We had a lot of people from Soviet Academy of Sciences.</v>

115
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.770
My daughter, Elizabeth, who's a psychiatrist,

116
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.590
also spoke Russian and she interviewed Juna

117
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.590
and asked Juna to describe her impressions right now

118
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.369
with regard to where someone

119
00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:29.449
in America would be hiding in two hours.

120
00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.778
We showed Juna a picture of that person

121
00:05:33.778 --> 00:05:36.138
and said, "You're not going to recognize this place,

122
00:05:36.138 --> 00:05:39.338
"of course, because we don't even know where he's gone

123
00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:41.238
"and you've never been to America.

124
00:05:41.238 --> 00:05:45.038
"If you just describe your impressions with regard

125
00:05:45.038 --> 00:05:48.598
"to where he is, our experience is that this experiment

126
00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:51.558
"will be successful" and that's sort of our mantra.

127
00:05:51.558 --> 00:05:53.658
That's what we tell people.

128
00:05:53.658 --> 00:05:58.198
Give up guessing and naming,

129
00:05:58.198 --> 00:06:01.178
and just tell us about your experience.

130
00:06:01.178 --> 00:06:06.178
If you surrender the reactive mind, the desire

131
00:06:06.238 --> 00:06:10.598
to give specific information, then you'll be able

132
00:06:10.598 --> 00:06:12.078
to describe the target.

133
00:06:12.078 --> 00:06:13.138
She did that very well.

134
00:06:13.138 --> 00:06:15.718
<v Regina>I still remember the drawing perfectly,</v>

135
00:06:15.718 --> 00:06:18.418
seeing the concentric circles, and the pier,

136
00:06:18.418 --> 00:06:21.038
and the water around when she chose the one target,

137
00:06:21.038 --> 00:06:24.113
which turned out to be Pier 39 in San Francisco.

138
00:06:24.113 --> 00:06:27.713
She couldn't understand these animals with glass eyes.

139
00:06:27.713 --> 00:06:28.773
<v ->That's exactly right.</v>

140
00:06:28.773 --> 00:06:29.713
<v Regina>The merry go round.</v>

141
00:06:29.713 --> 00:06:31.833
<v ->The merry go round had animals with glass eyes</v>

142
00:06:31.833 --> 00:06:35.433
and she drew all of that and talked about the glass eyes.

143
00:06:35.433 --> 00:06:36.733
It was really a very successful experiment.

144
00:06:36.733 --> 00:06:38.793
<v Regina>It was phenomenal, but what really blew my mind</v>

145
00:06:38.793 --> 00:06:40.713
at the time and I think is still hard for people

146
00:06:40.713 --> 00:06:43.313
to get their minds around is that that target

147
00:06:43.313 --> 00:06:45.673
had not been chosen yet.

148
00:06:45.673 --> 00:06:47.793
<v ->That's a very good observation.</v>

149
00:06:47.793 --> 00:06:51.073
As a way of adding security to the experiment,

150
00:06:51.073 --> 00:06:54.373
we said Juna will give her description and we will have

151
00:06:54.373 --> 00:06:58.273
that videotaped in Russia, and then two hours later,

152
00:06:58.273 --> 00:07:01.903
the traveler in San Francisco will throw a die

153
00:07:01.903 --> 00:07:05.273
on the floor and choose one of six targets

154
00:07:05.273 --> 00:07:08.313
that he had prepackaged in envelopes.

155
00:07:08.313 --> 00:07:12.653
If he throws target number six, he'll then go

156
00:07:12.653 --> 00:07:15.853
to the merry go round.

157
00:07:15.853 --> 00:07:16.893
<v Regina>Totally randomly--</v>

158
00:07:16.893 --> 00:07:19.413
<v ->At the time, Juna gave the description,</v>

159
00:07:19.413 --> 00:07:21.973
that target had not been chosen.

160
00:07:21.973 --> 00:07:24.913
The most important or the most interesting thing

161
00:07:24.913 --> 00:07:29.853
that we found in our work at Stanford is that describing

162
00:07:29.853 --> 00:07:33.173
something in the future is no more difficult

163
00:07:33.173 --> 00:07:36.493
than describing something that exists right now.

164
00:07:36.493 --> 00:07:39.653
That is to say it would be no harder for you

165
00:07:39.653 --> 00:07:43.773
to describe the picture on tomorrow's New York Times

166
00:07:43.773 --> 00:07:45.633
than it is to describe the picture

167
00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:47.893
in the envelope on the table today.

168
00:07:47.893 --> 00:07:49.873
<v Regina>Now, this has a lot of implications.</v>

169
00:07:49.873 --> 00:07:51.713
Where do we even begin with this one?

170
00:07:51.713 --> 00:07:53.973
Can you address that subject a little bit

171
00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:57.473
as the whole the subject of non-local awareness

172
00:07:57.473 --> 00:08:00.873
that's not limited by time or space,

173
00:08:00.873 --> 00:08:03.213
and then we need to start going toward

174
00:08:03.213 --> 00:08:04.232
what you're doing now.

175
00:08:04.232 --> 00:08:05.812
That was then.

176
00:08:05.812 --> 00:08:07.432
You've grown a lot; you've had a lot

177
00:08:07.432 --> 00:08:11.141
of your own personal revelations since then.

178
00:08:11.731 --> 00:08:16.185
<v ->Well, my job in the program we had at SRI</v>

179
00:08:16.185 --> 00:08:20.305
was to sit in the dark with CIA agents

180
00:08:20.305 --> 00:08:22.765
and other government scientists

181
00:08:22.765 --> 00:08:27.605
and help them to get in touch with their psychic abilities.

182
00:08:27.605 --> 00:08:31.465
I would lead them to have an experience

183
00:08:31.465 --> 00:08:35.385
of some distant place in the distance or in the future.

184
00:08:35.385 --> 00:08:37.245
Of course, I would never know the answer

185
00:08:37.245 --> 00:08:40.005
or would know anything about the answer,

186
00:08:40.005 --> 00:08:41.805
so I got to spend ten years sitting

187
00:08:41.805 --> 00:08:44.145
in the dark with my eyes shut as part

188
00:08:44.145 --> 00:08:47.485
of my spiritual training, paid for by the CIA.

189
00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:48.945
(Regina laughing)

190
00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:53.805
What became very clear to me in a realistic way

191
00:08:53.805 --> 00:08:58.705
is that we could not possibly be just physical beings,

192
00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:02.564
because our awareness is able to move through space

193
00:09:02.564 --> 00:09:05.683
and through time and describe what's happening

194
00:09:05.683 --> 00:09:09.683
at distant places, often quite accurately,

195
00:09:09.683 --> 00:09:11.783
and describe what's going to happen

196
00:09:11.783 --> 00:09:14.543
in the future, often quite accurately.

197
00:09:14.543 --> 00:09:18.083
For example, Ingo Swann, the famous New York psychic,

198
00:09:18.083 --> 00:09:19.543
who worked with us.

199
00:09:19.543 --> 00:09:21.483
Ingo Swann is really the inventor

200
00:09:21.483 --> 00:09:24.823
of remote viewing as we did at Stanford.

201
00:09:24.823 --> 00:09:28.343
He was once asked to describe what will be happening

202
00:09:28.343 --> 00:09:30.723
at a particular geographic coordinate,

203
00:09:30.723 --> 00:09:33.723
latitude and longitude, next Friday.

204
00:09:33.723 --> 00:09:37.243
Here we are on Monday and the CIA, in this case,

205
00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:39.943
wanted to know here are the coordinates.

206
00:09:39.943 --> 00:09:42.223
Something interesting is going to be happening there

207
00:09:42.223 --> 00:09:45.903
next Friday, can you tell us about that?

208
00:09:45.903 --> 00:09:49.163
Of course, Ingo didn't even know where it was

209
00:09:49.163 --> 00:09:53.723
and he said, "I see some kind of pyrotechnic display.

210
00:09:53.723 --> 00:09:55.923
"I need some colored pencils."

211
00:09:55.923 --> 00:09:59.743
What he drew was a beautiful fireworks display

212
00:09:59.743 --> 00:10:01.303
of the big cloud you get

213
00:10:01.303 --> 00:10:05.143
when you set off firecrackers, fireworks.

214
00:10:05.143 --> 00:10:09.343
As soon as they saw the picture that Ingo drew,

215
00:10:09.343 --> 00:10:14.343
they knew that the atomic bomb test they were interested in

216
00:10:14.903 --> 00:10:18.643
would be carried off and it would fail,

217
00:10:18.643 --> 00:10:22.723
because what Ingo had drawn is a nice

218
00:10:22.723 --> 00:10:26.943
multi-colored representation of a failed atomic bomb test

219
00:10:26.943 --> 00:10:29.763
where the uranium didn't explode,

220
00:10:29.763 --> 00:10:32.923
but was consumed in a fire.

221
00:10:32.923 --> 00:10:35.903
What he drew was a perfect artist representation

222
00:10:35.903 --> 00:10:40.023
of burning uranium, and he knew what was happening

223
00:10:40.023 --> 00:10:42.743
and what would happen a week in advance.

224
00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:44.403
<v Regina>It's amazing, because then you get</v>

225
00:10:44.403 --> 00:10:47.763
into subjects such as predetermination, et cetera,

226
00:10:47.763 --> 00:10:50.543
and I think we're all just struggling

227
00:10:50.543 --> 00:10:52.563
to figure out what we are.

228
00:10:52.563 --> 00:10:55.723
Some of these concepts, we can maybe understand

229
00:10:55.723 --> 00:10:57.483
in theory, but in practical terms,

230
00:10:57.483 --> 00:10:59.763
it is a little difficult to get our minds around,

231
00:10:59.763 --> 00:11:01.423
but you have gotten your mind around it

232
00:11:01.423 --> 00:11:03.823
to a large extent and you're now moving

233
00:11:03.823 --> 00:11:06.723
in a seperate direction from that.

234
00:11:06.723 --> 00:11:08.443
Not seperate in that that information

235
00:11:08.443 --> 00:11:10.903
and those talents, because you developed your own.

236
00:11:10.903 --> 00:11:13.063
You became a remote viewer yourself, right?

237
00:11:13.063 --> 00:11:14.923
<v ->Yes, occasionally.</v>

238
00:11:14.923 --> 00:11:17.363
It shows that even a scientist can be psychic

239
00:11:17.363 --> 00:11:18.183
(Regina laughing)

240
00:11:18.183 --> 00:11:19.903
if the necessity level is high enough.

241
00:11:19.903 --> 00:11:24.103
With regard to your other question about how does this work.

242
00:11:24.103 --> 00:11:27.463
As modern physics is beginning to get comfortable

243
00:11:27.463 --> 00:11:31.723
with the idea of non-locality, that is elementary particles

244
00:11:31.723 --> 00:11:34.923
separated from one another when they were born

245
00:11:34.923 --> 00:11:37.843
still remain connected as though they're part

246
00:11:37.843 --> 00:11:42.343
of the same energy configuration.

247
00:11:42.343 --> 00:11:45.203
This was understood or first enunciated

248
00:11:45.203 --> 00:11:49.493
in the late 1920s by Erwin Schrodinger.

249
00:11:50.783 --> 00:11:53.313
He's the one who perfected quantum mechanics

250
00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:55.253
with the wave equation.

251
00:11:55.253 --> 00:11:59.433
He was also the first person to talk about entanglement,

252
00:11:59.433 --> 00:12:01.713
the idea that when you send photons off

253
00:12:01.713 --> 00:12:05.433
in opposite directions and grab one of them,

254
00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:09.013
you will affect its twin who went in the other direction.

255
00:12:09.013 --> 00:12:13.243
Schrodinger was the first person to talk about that.

256
00:12:13.243 --> 00:12:18.243
Einstein wrote a paper with Podolsky and Rosen in 1935,

257
00:12:18.413 --> 00:12:23.144
known as the Einstein, Padolsky, Rosen or EPR Paper

258
00:12:23.144 --> 00:12:27.484
or at the time EPR Parodox, because Einstein felt

259
00:12:27.484 --> 00:12:30.164
that this conclusively showed there was something the matter

260
00:12:30.164 --> 00:12:34.164
with quantum mechanics since it implied

261
00:12:34.164 --> 00:12:37.444
that these photons traveling away from one another

262
00:12:37.444 --> 00:12:40.724
at the speed of light could still communicate.

263
00:12:40.724 --> 00:12:43.424
That appeared to violate relativity theory,

264
00:12:43.424 --> 00:12:45.424
which he knew worked quite well,

265
00:12:45.424 --> 00:12:47.404
so that was the parodox.

266
00:12:47.404 --> 00:12:51.423
In 1969, Freedman Clauser demonstrated

267
00:12:51.423 --> 00:12:56.303
at the UC Berkley campus that this connection did

268
00:12:56.303 --> 00:12:58.242
actually take place.

269
00:12:58.242 --> 00:13:01.942
Since then, other people, especially Nicolas Gisin

270
00:13:01.942 --> 00:13:06.562
in Switzerland showed that photons remain connected

271
00:13:06.562 --> 00:13:10.251
to one another over many kilometers.

272
00:13:11.361 --> 00:13:14.821
Gisin has the laser in Geneva, where he sent photons

273
00:13:14.821 --> 00:13:19.201
to the left, going off to Basel, and to the right,

274
00:13:19.201 --> 00:13:20.941
going off to Zurich.

275
00:13:20.941 --> 00:13:23.601
A physisist in Zurich turns a polarizer

276
00:13:23.601 --> 00:13:25.521
and something happened in Basel

277
00:13:25.521 --> 00:13:27.421
and there's no longer any argument

278
00:13:27.421 --> 00:13:30.301
about the existence of non-locality.

279
00:13:30.301 --> 00:13:30.961
<v Regina>Right.</v>

280
00:13:30.961 --> 00:13:34.881
<v ->Now, the Buddhist had talked about this 25 hundred years</v>

281
00:13:34.881 --> 00:13:37.861
before all these experiments,

282
00:13:37.861 --> 00:13:40.561
so in reading the Prajnaparamita,

283
00:13:40.561 --> 00:13:44.241
which is the writings of Buddha that came down to us,

284
00:13:44.241 --> 00:13:47.501
every page or two talks about the idea

285
00:13:47.501 --> 00:13:50.001
that separation is an illusion.

286
00:13:50.001 --> 00:13:52.041
Things appear separate from one another,

287
00:13:52.041 --> 00:13:54.261
but there's actually connection.

288
00:13:54.261 --> 00:13:58.561
We have many bodies but one conciousness.

289
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:04.422
It was a Hindu idea, pre-Buddhist idea,

290
00:14:04.422 --> 00:14:07.842
that Atman equaled Brahman, that the Atman,

291
00:14:07.842 --> 00:14:10.682
your soul, yourself, who you are,

292
00:14:10.682 --> 00:14:15.542
is one with Brahman, which is all of physical

293
00:14:15.542 --> 00:14:17.742
and nonphysical space-time.

294
00:14:17.742 --> 00:14:21.962
The idea that your awareness is one with all

295
00:14:21.962 --> 00:14:26.962
of physical reality is a 5,000-year-old idea.

296
00:14:27.322 --> 00:14:28.722
<v Regina>Right, and we're just getting around</v>

297
00:14:28.722 --> 00:14:32.382
to being able to validate that from the world of science.

298
00:14:32.382 --> 00:14:34.782
<v ->Modern physics finally has stood up</v>

299
00:14:34.782 --> 00:14:37.642
and said, "Yes, the Buddhists got it right."

300
00:14:37.642 --> 00:14:40.202
<v Regina>(laughing) Wouldn't it have been simple?</v>

301
00:14:40.202 --> 00:14:44.532
You talk about letting go of conditioning

302
00:14:44.532 --> 00:14:47.672
in the process of being able to embrace.

303
00:14:47.672 --> 00:14:51.572
Your subject now, the new book, the End of Suffering,

304
00:14:51.572 --> 00:14:54.692
in order to move toward a state where we can move

305
00:14:54.692 --> 00:14:57.192
beyond suffering, what was the genesis of that?

306
00:14:57.192 --> 00:15:00.472
I know you had some observations regarding

307
00:15:00.472 --> 00:15:03.112
some fellow employees at Lockheed and what would happen

308
00:15:03.112 --> 00:15:05.332
to them after their careers were over.

309
00:15:05.332 --> 00:15:09.452
Can you talk about that, give us some lineage on this idea?

310
00:15:09.452 --> 00:15:11.312
<v ->Yes, you actually asked me two--</v>

311
00:15:11.312 --> 00:15:13.072
<v Regina>Five questions at one time (laughing).</v>

312
00:15:13.072 --> 00:15:14.652
<v ->Two pretty unrelated questions.</v>

313
00:15:14.652 --> 00:15:15.572
<v Regina>Just pick one.</v>

314
00:15:15.572 --> 00:15:18.052
<v ->In the End of Suffering, I'm celebrating</v>

315
00:15:18.052 --> 00:15:22.312
a second century Buddhist teacher, named Nagarjuna.

316
00:15:22.312 --> 00:15:25.332
He in a way described very accurately

317
00:15:25.332 --> 00:15:27.492
how remote viewing works.

318
00:15:27.492 --> 00:15:30.472
He said you have to give up conditioned awareness.

319
00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:32.852
In conditioned awareness, you're responding

320
00:15:32.852 --> 00:15:37.052
to what your parents taught you, what television taught you,

321
00:15:37.052 --> 00:15:42.052
what teachers tell you, what society tells you is right,

322
00:15:42.132 --> 00:15:45.112
and most of all what your ego tells you.

323
00:15:45.112 --> 00:15:47.572
If you reside in conditioned awareness,

324
00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:50.912
you tend to be self-centered,

325
00:15:50.912 --> 00:15:55.661
self-pitying, suffering, and lonely.

326
00:15:55.719 --> 00:15:58.919
He said that if you want to expand your awareness

327
00:15:58.919 --> 00:16:02.239
to take part in the spaciousness that's available,

328
00:16:02.239 --> 00:16:05.459
you must move from conditioned awareness

329
00:16:05.459 --> 00:16:09.399
to naked awareness or non-local awareness.

330
00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:11.799
He talked about naked existence,

331
00:16:11.799 --> 00:16:14.829
in which you are flexible,

332
00:16:14.829 --> 00:16:17.759
and generous, and spacious,

333
00:16:17.759 --> 00:16:22.547
and loving, and joyous, and nonjudgemental,

334
00:16:22.547 --> 00:16:24.767
so you have an opportunity to experience things

335
00:16:24.767 --> 00:16:28.867
as they are rather than through your conditioning.

336
00:16:28.867 --> 00:16:33.227
In the conditioned state, even 15 hundred years ago,

337
00:16:33.227 --> 00:16:35.527
they were talking about the dangers of naming

338
00:16:35.527 --> 00:16:40.167
and grasping as a mechanism that causes you

339
00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:43.827
to interfere with what's actually happening.

340
00:16:43.827 --> 00:16:47.507
<v Regina>Taking that back to the other part</v>

341
00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:50.647
of the question that seemd totally unrelated,

342
00:16:50.647 --> 00:16:53.377
the experience that you noticed with your colleagues

343
00:16:53.377 --> 00:16:55.617
at Lockheed was an example of what happens

344
00:16:55.617 --> 00:16:58.717
when that identity is taken away from you.

345
00:16:58.717 --> 00:16:59.917
<v ->That's exactly right.</v>

346
00:16:59.917 --> 00:17:02.097
I spent a decade at Lockheed.

347
00:17:02.097 --> 00:17:05.012
I had an idea that you could put lasers on airplanes

348
00:17:05.012 --> 00:17:08.352
to detect windsheer and air turbulance

349
00:17:08.352 --> 00:17:11.252
and I had several programs with Lockheed working there.

350
00:17:11.252 --> 00:17:13.212
I went back to my roots

351
00:17:13.212 --> 00:17:17.712
after doing remote sensing with ESP,

352
00:17:17.712 --> 00:17:21.481
I went Lockheed to do remote sensing with lasers.

353
00:17:21.481 --> 00:17:26.321
Interestingly, remote sensing with ESP is more reliable,

354
00:17:26.321 --> 00:17:28.561
because the lasers don't work worth a damn

355
00:17:28.561 --> 00:17:31.701
when it's raining and the ESP works whether it's raining

356
00:17:31.701 --> 00:17:34.341
or the sun is shining.

357
00:17:34.341 --> 00:17:38.661
At Lockheed what I observed in my first years there

358
00:17:38.661 --> 00:17:42.801
as I would read the Lockheed newspaper week after week

359
00:17:42.801 --> 00:17:46.621
that there were pages called In Memorium,

360
00:17:46.621 --> 00:17:48.781
commemorating or celebrating the death

361
00:17:48.781 --> 00:17:51.761
of people, old employees.

362
00:17:51.761 --> 00:17:55.041
What I observed is a lot of them weren't very old.

363
00:17:55.041 --> 00:17:57.681
Lockheed has more or less

364
00:17:57.681 --> 00:18:00.891
mandatory retirement at 65.

365
00:18:00.891 --> 00:18:03.561
There was a huge over representation of people

366
00:18:03.561 --> 00:18:06.621
who were 67, 68 years old,

367
00:18:06.621 --> 00:18:11.461
which is to say the life expectancy--

368
00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:12.960
<v Regina>In the obituaries?</v>

369
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.280
<v ->In the obituaries.</v>

370
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.700
The actuarial life expectancy of a man

371
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.240
who lived to be 65 is 80.

372
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.640
The man has gotten past dying in the war,

373
00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.420
or car crashes, or hunting accidents, or drinking himself

374
00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.580
to death, all the things that kill men off,

375
00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.660
if you've gotten to be 65 and actually retired,

376
00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.820
you're expected to live for another 15 years,

377
00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.840
but these people were dying within two or three years.

378
00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.820
That's of course very alarming for a young employee.

379
00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.640
You don't have much to look forward to.

380
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.520
We worked with Boeing and McDonald Douglas.

381
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.973
Because of my experience with statistics

382
00:18:53.973 --> 00:18:57.153
and the ESP program, it was clear to me in looking

383
00:18:57.153 --> 00:19:00.373
at several years of past newspapers

384
00:19:00.373 --> 00:19:05.133
that there was a huge over representation of early deaths.

385
00:19:05.133 --> 00:19:07.333
In a certain sense, working aerospace

386
00:19:07.333 --> 00:19:10.113
was really hazardous to your health.

387
00:19:10.113 --> 00:19:12.933
What I discovered, talking to the human resources people

388
00:19:12.933 --> 00:19:17.503
is that the big aerospace companies were considering

389
00:19:17.503 --> 00:19:20.189
under-funding their pension programs,

390
00:19:20.189 --> 00:19:22.149
because no one was living long enough

391
00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:24.089
to actually collect the money.

392
00:19:24.089 --> 00:19:25.349
<v Regina>Jesus, did they tell the applicants</v>

393
00:19:25.349 --> 00:19:26.249
that in advance?

394
00:19:26.249 --> 00:19:29.489
<v ->No, that's something I discovered quite recently</v>

395
00:19:29.489 --> 00:19:33.749
in writing the End of Suffering is I wanted to document

396
00:19:33.749 --> 00:19:36.569
this material that I had picked up just from the newspapers.

397
00:19:36.569 --> 00:19:39.549
<v Regina>So they knew about this particular phenomenon,</v>

398
00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:41.369
that these people were dying shortly after retiring?

399
00:19:41.369 --> 00:19:42.029
<v ->Yes.</v>

400
00:19:42.029 --> 00:19:43.989
<v Regina>Why were they dying shortly after retirement?</v>

401
00:19:43.989 --> 00:19:45.409
In my opinion, they were dying

402
00:19:45.409 --> 00:19:49.109
because Lockheed is a good employer.

403
00:19:49.109 --> 00:19:52.369
People live there comfortably and are quite happy

404
00:19:52.369 --> 00:19:55.189
to have a business card that says, "I'm a Lockheed engineer"

405
00:19:55.189 --> 00:19:57.309
or "I'm a Boeing engineer."

406
00:19:57.309 --> 00:20:01.149
Then on the day they turn 65, Lockheed takes away

407
00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:04.149
your business card, tears it up,

408
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:06.589
and says suddenly you're no one,

409
00:20:06.589 --> 00:20:09.600
and they send the engineer home to annoy his wife.

410
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:14.600
Suddenly, after 25 or 30 years of being a well-respected

411
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.620
engineer and memeber of the community,

412
00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.060
he's suddenly nothing.

413
00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:23.100
He's lost who he is or he's lost his story of who he is.

414
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.180
The motivation, the thing that pushed me

415
00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.540
to write the End of Suffering is I began to see

416
00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.420
in a number of different instances how people

417
00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.760
experience suffering defending the story

418
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.210
of who they think they are.

419
00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:38.592
<v Regina>The conditioning you were talking about earlier.</v>

420
00:20:38.592 --> 00:20:40.092
<v ->That's right, defending the conditioning</v>

421
00:20:40.092 --> 00:20:42.032
of who they think they are.

422
00:20:42.032 --> 00:20:45.252
It's the idea of defending your business card.

423
00:20:45.252 --> 00:20:48.072
If you think who you are is what it says

424
00:20:48.072 --> 00:20:50.772
on your business card, I can guarantee

425
00:20:50.772 --> 00:20:52.612
that you're in for a lot of suffering,

426
00:20:52.612 --> 00:20:54.432
because that won't last.

427
00:20:54.432 --> 00:20:57.532
Similarly, if you think that who you are is what you see

428
00:20:57.532 --> 00:21:00.612
in the mirror in the morning, that's also gonna be

429
00:21:00.612 --> 00:21:04.112
a big disappointment, because that's gonna change.

430
00:21:04.112 --> 00:21:08.232
The thrust of this book is to encourage people

431
00:21:08.232 --> 00:21:11.392
to have a more spacious view to recognize

432
00:21:11.392 --> 00:21:15.112
that who they are is really a non-local awareness

433
00:21:15.112 --> 00:21:19.552
fortunate enough to reside as a body for this time,

434
00:21:19.552 --> 00:21:21.732
because we know bodies are hard to come by

435
00:21:21.732 --> 00:21:23.932
and we're very fortunate to have one.

436
00:21:23.932 --> 00:21:26.672
It allows us to share intimacy, and share love,

437
00:21:26.672 --> 00:21:30.092
and communicate with loved ones through having bodies,

438
00:21:30.092 --> 00:21:32.152
and we should take good care of them.

439
00:21:32.152 --> 00:21:35.212
I'm certainly not saying that we should neglect our body,

440
00:21:35.212 --> 00:21:38.592
but it's an error to think that's all of who you are.

441
00:21:38.592 --> 00:21:40.952
<v Regina>How do you, in this book,</v>

442
00:21:40.952 --> 00:21:45.672
progress people through, say, the process

443
00:21:45.672 --> 00:21:48.632
of letting go of conditioning and starting to move

444
00:21:48.632 --> 00:21:50.992
toward the understanding of themselves as something

445
00:21:50.992 --> 00:21:55.092
of non-local awareness as if we're spirit?

446
00:21:55.092 --> 00:21:57.992
<v ->Well, I have five steps very much in line</v>

447
00:21:57.992 --> 00:22:01.012
with the Buddhist eightfold path, but everyone's

448
00:22:01.012 --> 00:22:03.852
in a big hurry now, so I have five of them.

449
00:22:03.852 --> 00:22:06.672
<v Regina>(laughing) You cut it down to the fivefold path.</v>

450
00:22:06.672 --> 00:22:08.052
<v ->Gotta cut to the chase.</v>

451
00:22:08.052 --> 00:22:10.992
<v Regina>Sure you can't get it down to two or three?</v>

452
00:22:10.992 --> 00:22:14.251
<v ->The main one would be mindfulness,</v>

453
00:22:14.251 --> 00:22:17.020
which the Buddhists are very much in agreement with,

454
00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.900
in which you find a way to stop the ongoing chatter,

455
00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.740
that as most of us have well-functioning minds

456
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:27.040
for which we have not yet found the off switch.

457
00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:32.040
In order to stop suffering or take charge of your awareness,

458
00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.540
you have to find a way to stop the ongoing chatter

459
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.500
and people do that generally through

460
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.190
some kind of meditation practice.

461
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.660
<v Regina>Why do they have to stop the chatter?</v>

462
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:47.300
<v ->Because you have to be able to notice the spaciousness</v>

463
00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:48.840
in which you reside.

464
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.200
You have to notice there's something besides the checkbook,

465
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.440
the television--
<v Regina>Laundry.</v>

466
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.400
<v ->news and the ongoing chatter in your life.</v>

467
00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.080
You have to notice that there's something else happening.

468
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.580
Through this mindfulness, you get a chance to participate

469
00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:11.580
in transcendent knowing, and transcendent doing,

470
00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.944
and transcendent being.

471
00:23:13.944 --> 00:23:16.364
Transcendent knowing, as you've caught

472
00:23:16.364 --> 00:23:19.444
onto is non-local awareness.

473
00:23:19.444 --> 00:23:24.064
When you get control of your ongoing mental chatter

474
00:23:24.064 --> 00:23:27.604
and stop that, you can then experience the spaciousness

475
00:23:27.604 --> 00:23:31.164
that's available and discover that your awareness

476
00:23:31.164 --> 00:23:34.634
fills space-time and you can get

477
00:23:34.634 --> 00:23:37.951
off of this pity pot

478
00:23:37.951 --> 00:23:41.871
of self-centeredness and self-concern

479
00:23:41.871 --> 00:23:43.762
that tends to occupy us.

480
00:23:43.762 --> 00:23:45.222
<v Regina>That's boring anyway.</v>

481
00:23:45.222 --> 00:23:46.382
<v ->Very boring.</v>

482
00:23:46.382 --> 00:23:48.310
<v Regina>What's number two?</v>

483
00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.140
After mindfulness, where do you go after mindfulness?

484
00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.960
<v ->Mindfulness, well, I was gonna say part of this</v>

485
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.620
just briefly would be transcendent doing,

486
00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.820
which would involve spiritual healing,

487
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.680
and transcendent being, which participates

488
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.429
in this spacious existence.

489
00:24:09.019 --> 00:24:12.659
Emptiness is a very important part of the Buddhist teaching.

490
00:24:12.659 --> 00:24:17.339
In my mind, from my understanding of Buddhism,

491
00:24:17.339 --> 00:24:21.399
the idea of emptiness is the key Buddhist teaching.

492
00:24:21.399 --> 00:24:25.259
Of course, other Buddhist scholars may not agree with that,

493
00:24:25.259 --> 00:24:30.259
but it's the idea that we learn is

494
00:24:30.419 --> 00:24:32.299
that nothing is happening

495
00:24:32.299 --> 00:24:35.017
except to the extent that we give it meaning.

496
00:24:35.017 --> 00:24:37.917
That is, when the Buddhists talk about emptiness,

497
00:24:37.917 --> 00:24:42.917
they're not saying that there's no table here or no chair.

498
00:24:43.168 --> 00:24:46.408
What they're saying is that whatever you see exists

499
00:24:46.408 --> 00:24:49.518
only through the meaning that you give it.

500
00:24:50.738 --> 00:24:54.202
They're not saying the universe is empty of things.

501
00:24:54.202 --> 00:24:56.982
They're saying the universe is empty of meaning,

502
00:24:56.982 --> 00:24:59.142
apart from the meaning you assign it.

503
00:24:59.142 --> 00:25:01.082
<v Regina>But even in the physical world,</v>

504
00:25:01.082 --> 00:25:03.822
the whole notion that there's more space than matter

505
00:25:03.822 --> 00:25:06.162
to begin with, I mean, isn't this just a reflection

506
00:25:06.162 --> 00:25:08.210
somewhat of that?

507
00:25:11.454 --> 00:25:15.094
<v ->I think that scientists agree</v>

508
00:25:15.094 --> 00:25:16.805
that there's more space than matter.

509
00:25:16.805 --> 00:25:18.545
In fact, we're coming to understand

510
00:25:18.545 --> 00:25:20.485
that there's very little matter.

511
00:25:20.485 --> 00:25:25.445
The idea of emptiness apart from the assignment

512
00:25:25.445 --> 00:25:29.365
you give to it really reflects on things,

513
00:25:29.365 --> 00:25:32.185
such as if somebody comes up to me and says,

514
00:25:32.185 --> 00:25:33.945
"That's a stupid outfit you're wearing.

515
00:25:33.945 --> 00:25:36.905
"Why are you wearing those crazy outlandish clothes

516
00:25:36.905 --> 00:25:38.865
"that you're wearing?"

517
00:25:38.865 --> 00:25:42.765
I can take that insult and paste it into the big insult book

518
00:25:42.765 --> 00:25:46.945
that I carry in my backpack, or I can just laugh at them

519
00:25:46.945 --> 00:25:49.485
and realize that nothing at all happened.

520
00:25:49.485 --> 00:25:52.005
I have that choice.

521
00:25:52.005 --> 00:25:55.625
If you're driving in traffic, you can recognize

522
00:25:55.625 --> 00:25:59.505
that the traffic you're driving in is like Brownian motion,

523
00:25:59.505 --> 00:26:02.865
which is the random motion of little particles

524
00:26:02.865 --> 00:26:05.185
in a jar that Einstein wrote about.

525
00:26:05.185 --> 00:26:09.345
The particles in a jar move just from their kinetic energy.

526
00:26:09.345 --> 00:26:13.085
As you drive down the highway, the cars are moving

527
00:26:13.085 --> 00:26:14.825
just because of the random motions

528
00:26:14.825 --> 00:26:17.985
of the driver of those cars.

529
00:26:17.985 --> 00:26:21.145
Has nothing at all to do with you.

530
00:26:21.145 --> 00:26:25.205
As you drive down the street, you can personalize

531
00:26:25.205 --> 00:26:27.525
each person who cuts you off

532
00:26:27.525 --> 00:26:31.225
and give him a universal hand signal of displeasure,

533
00:26:31.225 --> 00:26:36.225
or blow your horn, or call out something

534
00:26:36.385 --> 00:26:39.765
expressing your anger, or you can just recognize

535
00:26:39.765 --> 00:26:41.945
that this is the random motion.

536
00:26:41.945 --> 00:26:44.845
It's certainly wise to pay attention as you're driving,

537
00:26:44.845 --> 00:26:48.025
but not to personalize what occurs.

538
00:26:48.025 --> 00:26:49.625
It's essentially random.

539
00:26:49.625 --> 00:26:51.945
<v Regina>This takes care of victimization. Gone.</v>

540
00:26:51.945 --> 00:26:53.885
<v ->That's right.</v>

541
00:26:53.885 --> 00:26:56.405
For example, I once drove from San Francisco

542
00:26:56.405 --> 00:26:57.985
to Los Angeles with a person

543
00:26:57.985 --> 00:27:00.845
who was a professional racecar driver.

544
00:27:00.845 --> 00:27:05.285
By the time we got to Los Angeles, I was quite surprised

545
00:27:05.285 --> 00:27:08.565
by the fact that nothing at all happened.

546
00:27:08.565 --> 00:27:10.485
No one ever blew his horn at us.

547
00:27:10.485 --> 00:27:12.345
We never blew our horn at anyone.

548
00:27:12.345 --> 00:27:14.585
There were no short stops.

549
00:27:14.585 --> 00:27:19.585
It was as though we just smoothly sailed our five hour trip

550
00:27:19.805 --> 00:27:21.605
from San Francisco to Los Angeles.

551
00:27:21.605 --> 00:27:23.465
<v Regina>Five hours, oh.</v>

552
00:27:23.465 --> 00:27:27.485
<v ->It was pretty fast.</v>

553
00:27:27.485 --> 00:27:28.605
<v Regina>Yeah, it was pretty fast.</v>

554
00:27:28.605 --> 00:27:29.539
I know, I've driven that trip.

555
00:27:29.539 --> 00:27:31.555
<v ->Maybe six, maybe six.</v>

556
00:27:32.635 --> 00:27:36.268
But it was a event free trip.

557
00:27:36.268 --> 00:27:39.210
<v Regina>Was that because that was your expectation?</v>

558
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.990
<v ->No, that's because the way he drives.</v>

559
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:45.128
I was his passenger.

560
00:27:45.128 --> 00:27:47.848
The driver just doesn't personalize anything.

561
00:27:47.848 --> 00:27:52.208
He's very vigilent and, as far as he's concerned,

562
00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:54.728
he's just driving through the rocks

563
00:27:54.728 --> 00:27:56.828
and he doesn't personalize any of the rocks.

564
00:27:56.828 --> 00:27:58.788
It's as though you're standing on the beach.

565
00:27:58.788 --> 00:28:01.948
You're walking down the beach and a wave knocks you over.

566
00:28:01.948 --> 00:28:04.308
Well, that happens from time to time,

567
00:28:04.308 --> 00:28:07.528
but nobody would foolishly get angry with the wave.

568
00:28:07.528 --> 00:28:09.388
You wouldn't take it personally.

569
00:28:09.388 --> 00:28:12.848
You walk on the beach from time to time, you'll get wet.

570
00:28:12.848 --> 00:28:13.588
<v Regina>Right.</v>

571
00:28:13.588 --> 00:28:16.748
But your fellow man, you take it personally.

572
00:28:16.748 --> 00:28:19.768
<v ->That's right, so we have the idea</v>

573
00:28:19.768 --> 00:28:22.268
of mindfulness to stop the chatter.

574
00:28:22.268 --> 00:28:27.268
Emptiness, which is the desire we have

575
00:28:27.668 --> 00:28:30.498
to avoid personalizing the things

576
00:28:30.498 --> 00:28:33.694
that happen to us in our lives.

577
00:28:33.694 --> 00:28:36.854
Now, compassion is the next step.

578
00:28:36.854 --> 00:28:40.054
In a compassionate life, you recognize

579
00:28:40.054 --> 00:28:43.154
that there's no separation between us.

580
00:28:43.154 --> 00:28:47.854
It's the Buddhist idea of one consciousness in many bodies.

581
00:28:47.854 --> 00:28:51.622
There is indeed suffering on the earth.

582
00:28:53.932 --> 00:28:57.572
What what we learn is what gives meaning to our life

583
00:28:57.572 --> 00:29:01.292
is that after you've had an oceanic connection

584
00:29:01.292 --> 00:29:03.752
with something bigger than yourself,

585
00:29:03.752 --> 00:29:06.492
you then wanna share that experience.

586
00:29:06.492 --> 00:29:08.492
You wanna let people know

587
00:29:08.492 --> 00:29:11.172
that they are not simply a physical body,

588
00:29:11.172 --> 00:29:16.172
but this feeling of residing in love,

589
00:29:16.592 --> 00:29:21.372
the flow of loving awareness really defines who you are.

590
00:29:21.372 --> 00:29:24.712
That experience is not outside yourself.

591
00:29:24.712 --> 00:29:27.392
That is, it's a mistake to look

592
00:29:27.392 --> 00:29:30.812
for a person to complete yourself.

593
00:29:30.812 --> 00:29:34.052
Just say, "Well, I'm a pretty good half a person.

594
00:29:34.052 --> 00:29:37.532
"If I could only find another half a person to complete me,

595
00:29:37.532 --> 00:29:39.112
"then everything would be perfect."

596
00:29:39.112 --> 00:29:41.052
Of course, that never works.

597
00:29:41.052 --> 00:29:44.732
It leads to resentment when she quits doing

598
00:29:44.732 --> 00:29:47.292
whatever it was she did to make you feel complete

599
00:29:47.292 --> 00:29:51.052
and that's why loving relationships turn

600
00:29:51.052 --> 00:29:54.572
to hateful relationships instantaniously,

601
00:29:54.572 --> 00:29:56.092
because you're dropped back to

602
00:29:56.092 --> 00:29:59.012
that annoying half a person status.

603
00:29:59.012 --> 00:30:02.912
It's all about defending your ego, defending your story.

604
00:30:05.862 --> 00:30:10.272
It's a idea in Judeo-Christian teaching

605
00:30:10.272 --> 00:30:12.352
as well as the Buddhist teaching

606
00:30:12.352 --> 00:30:17.352
that the kingdom of God is within you and not outside.

607
00:30:17.692 --> 00:30:20.342
One of the thrusts in the end of our book,

608
00:30:20.342 --> 00:30:23.712
in the End of Suffering is to argue

609
00:30:23.712 --> 00:30:26.952
in favor of the non-dual approach,

610
00:30:26.952 --> 00:30:31.541
the idea that you and the divine are one.

611
00:30:31.691 --> 00:30:35.871
As Thomas Aquinas and Saint Agustan argued

612
00:30:35.871 --> 00:30:38.491
that there's no happiness on this earth.

613
00:30:38.491 --> 00:30:41.611
You'll only be happy in the next life, where you become one

614
00:30:41.611 --> 00:30:46.211
with God, since you're all a bunch of sinners in this life.

615
00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:47.891
<v Regina>In the corporeal life, right.</v>

616
00:30:47.891 --> 00:30:50.861
<v ->In the coporeal life because Adam sinned,</v>

617
00:30:50.861 --> 00:30:52.851
you're never gonna know God, you're never

618
00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:56.671
gonna find happiness, and it will only come after you die.

619
00:30:56.671 --> 00:31:00.071
Agustan and Aquinas wrote extensively arguing

620
00:31:00.071 --> 00:31:05.000
about the hopeless of finding happiness in this life.

621
00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:13.210
The non-dual teaching is that you and divine are one.

622
00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:18.366
That is, in the dualistic teaching,

623
00:31:18.366 --> 00:31:21.706
you learn that God is omnipotent.

624
00:31:21.706 --> 00:31:26.706
I'm thinking the Mony Python Meaning of Life,

625
00:31:27.046 --> 00:31:30.126
when John Cleese walks into the big church

626
00:31:30.126 --> 00:31:32.086
and he said, "God, you're so big,

627
00:31:32.086 --> 00:31:35.526
"and so powerful, and so omnipotent.

628
00:31:35.526 --> 00:31:39.986
"I'm so small, and so puny, and so helpless.

629
00:31:39.986 --> 00:31:41.646
"Won't you help me?"

630
00:31:41.646 --> 00:31:42.786
That's the extreme.

631
00:31:42.786 --> 00:31:46.726
Monty Python gives an example of the extreme dualistic--

632
00:31:46.726 --> 00:31:48.226
<v Regina>Powerlessness.</v>

633
00:31:48.226 --> 00:31:49.286
<v ->Right, powerless.</v>

634
00:31:49.286 --> 00:31:53.706
Extreme dualistic picture of God is up there, powerful.

635
00:31:53.706 --> 00:31:57.466
You're a little ant down here

636
00:31:57.466 --> 00:31:58.946
and that caused a lot of suffering.

637
00:31:58.946 --> 00:32:00.666
That's the extreme dualistic picture

638
00:32:00.666 --> 00:32:03.966
and that's brought to us by Aristotle,

639
00:32:03.966 --> 00:32:08.966
who says a thing is either true or it's not true

640
00:32:09.285 --> 00:32:11.990
and it caused a lot of suffering to believe

641
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:14.810
that you're separated from the divine.

642
00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:16.650
The teachings of Christ, of course,

643
00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:19.530
and the teaching of the Buddhists is

644
00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:23.050
that you are one with the divine

645
00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:26.529
and that you are one with this flow of loving awareness,

646
00:32:26.529 --> 00:32:28.689
which is who you are.

647
00:32:28.689 --> 00:32:31.169
The Advaita Vedanta invites you to find out

648
00:32:31.169 --> 00:32:33.849
who you are is their principle teaching.

649
00:32:33.849 --> 00:32:37.429
That's one of the things that we're trying

650
00:32:37.429 --> 00:32:40.249
to do in this book is to get peole to ask the question

651
00:32:40.249 --> 00:32:43.069
who they are and we try and give some steps

652
00:32:43.069 --> 00:32:45.369
that allow people to do that.

653
00:32:45.369 --> 00:32:46.849
<v Regina>When you continue on</v>

654
00:32:46.849 --> 00:32:50.189
in these five of the eight (laughing)

655
00:32:50.189 --> 00:32:52.869
on the path is community and gratitude as well.

656
00:32:52.869 --> 00:32:54.509
Gratitude seems to be something that's coming up a lot--

657
00:32:54.509 --> 00:32:56.649
<v ->Well, community is critical in order</v>

658
00:32:56.649 --> 00:33:00.829
to find a spiritual community or a song-ga

659
00:33:00.829 --> 00:33:04.169
in which you can safely express and explore

660
00:33:04.169 --> 00:33:06.429
your spiritual desires and needs.

661
00:33:06.429 --> 00:33:08.169
It's very important to find--

662
00:33:08.169 --> 00:33:12.709
A investment club won't meet these needs, by the way.

663
00:33:12.709 --> 00:33:14.989
This has to be a safe place

664
00:33:14.989 --> 00:33:19.989
to explore your spiritual experiences.

665
00:33:20.969 --> 00:33:22.869
You see nothing I've talked about

666
00:33:22.869 --> 00:33:25.249
involves belief in anything at all.

667
00:33:25.249 --> 00:33:28.829
I am a fairly unreconstructed physisist.

668
00:33:28.829 --> 00:33:32.889
I've had some experiences in connection with my work

669
00:33:32.889 --> 00:33:37.749
at Stanford Research Institute doing psychic things

670
00:33:37.749 --> 00:33:41.489
and then I'm recapitulating what the Buddhists have taught

671
00:33:41.489 --> 00:33:45.549
in straight forward California English

672
00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:47.629
so that the people will have an idea

673
00:33:47.629 --> 00:33:50.409
that these experiences are available.

674
00:33:50.409 --> 00:33:54.929
The idea that God exists as an experience

675
00:33:54.929 --> 00:33:59.507
in consciousness, not as an entity out in space.

676
00:34:00.617 --> 00:34:01.657
<v Regina>Here now, all around.</v>

677
00:34:01.657 --> 00:34:05.777
<v ->Here now, available, this experience of the divine,</v>

678
00:34:05.777 --> 00:34:08.317
whether you wanna call it God, or Brahman,

679
00:34:08.317 --> 00:34:12.737
or spaciousness, but the experience of the divine,

680
00:34:12.737 --> 00:34:16.457
this loving syrup in which we can reside

681
00:34:16.457 --> 00:34:19.837
is available to us if we stop the chatter.

682
00:34:19.837 --> 00:34:23.957
One of the purposes of this book is to help people,

683
00:34:23.957 --> 00:34:28.957
first of all, give up the story, recognize that they are,

684
00:34:29.337 --> 00:34:32.957
basically, non-local awareness rather than

685
00:34:32.957 --> 00:34:35.537
what is says on the business card.

686
00:34:35.537 --> 00:34:38.557
The extent to which they identify personally

687
00:34:38.557 --> 00:34:40.957
with the business card is a source of suffering.

688
00:34:40.957 --> 00:34:44.957
Then we encourage them to move into the spaciousness

689
00:34:44.957 --> 00:34:49.957
as a way of life and give up the focus on the ego,

690
00:34:50.377 --> 00:34:53.616
self-centeredness, and self-pity

691
00:34:53.616 --> 00:34:57.836
and move into spaciousness with its generosity,

692
00:34:57.836 --> 00:35:01.576
and flexibility, and joyful life.

693
00:35:01.576 --> 00:35:03.176
<v Regina>And community and gratitude.</v>

694
00:35:03.176 --> 00:35:05.716
<v ->And gratitude, that's what we're offering.</v>

695
00:35:05.716 --> 00:35:07.036
That's the program.

696
00:35:07.036 --> 00:35:08.976
<v Regina>I can't imagine a message any more needed</v>

697
00:35:08.976 --> 00:35:11.436
than the end of suffering, because essentially,

698
00:35:11.436 --> 00:35:13.416
that takes us to a path of wholeness.

699
00:35:13.416 --> 00:35:14.816
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

700
00:35:14.816 --> 00:35:16.276
<v Regina>Well, thank you so much for your time.</v>
