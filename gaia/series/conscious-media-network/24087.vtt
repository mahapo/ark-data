00:00:01.431 --> 00:00:03.585
<v ->John Major Jenkins has made it his work</v>

2
00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:06.390
to understand a phenomenon that is making its way

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.303
into the consciousness of people around the world,

4
00:00:09.303 --> 00:00:12.482
the meaning behind the end date of the Mayan calendar,

5
00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:15.361
December 21st, 2012.

6
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:17.409
While many with a religious world view

7
00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:19.639
see it as synonymous with Armageddon,

8
00:00:19.639 --> 00:00:21.516
according to John Major Jenkins,

9
00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:25.185
there's an entirely different opportunity here for mankind.

10
00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:28.481
A scholar with a gentle and deeply insightful soul,

11
00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:30.550
John puts intelligence and grace

12
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.493
into this hotly debated subject.

13
00:00:32.493 --> 00:00:37.489 line:15% 
(peaceful music)

14
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:44.236
Let's begin with the increasing awareness

15
00:00:44.236 --> 00:00:47.062
of this date that is looming out there,

16
00:00:47.062 --> 00:00:50.550
which is the winter solstice of 2012.

17
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.304
Why has this become such a buzz now

18
00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:57.814
among the consciousness of people all over the world?

19
00:00:57.814 --> 00:00:59.819
<v ->Well, the end date of the Maya calendar,</v>

20
00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:04.533
December 21st, 2012 is a true artifact

21
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.124
of the Maya calendar tradition,

22
00:01:06.124 --> 00:01:08.531
and recently there's been increasing interest

23
00:01:08.531 --> 00:01:10.755
in what this is all about.

24
00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:13.309
As we get closer and closer to 2012,

25
00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:15.272
it's understandable that there's gonna be

26
00:01:15.272 --> 00:01:17.864
even more increasing interest around this.

27
00:01:17.864 --> 00:01:21.526
I think that people are very interested in this date

28
00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:26.488
because it is a symbol of our transformation.

29
00:01:26.488 --> 00:01:28.537
It is a symbol of

30
00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.424
a new chance to recreate our world.

31
00:01:35.424 --> 00:01:38.496
There's a lot of different perspectives on the 2012 date,

32
00:01:38.496 --> 00:01:41.792
and my research draws from information

33
00:01:41.792 --> 00:01:43.958
from the Maya creation mythology.

34
00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.977
And there are teachings encoded in the Maya creation myth

35
00:01:46.977 --> 00:01:50.747
that tell us about this whole idea of transformation

36
00:01:50.747 --> 00:01:55.251
and reconnecting with a higher transcendent wisdom.

37
00:01:56.262 --> 00:01:57.881
<v Voiceover>So it's being interpreted,</v>

38
00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:00.920
depending on an individual's belief system,

39
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.086
it's being interpreted any number of ways.

40
00:02:03.086 --> 00:02:05.677
Some people see it as a cataclysmic event

41
00:02:05.677 --> 00:02:06.915
where we're going to have nothing

42
00:02:06.915 --> 00:02:08.962
but death and destruction and challenge,

43
00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.733
and so forth leading up to it,

44
00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:12.142
and who knows what on the day,

45
00:02:12.142 --> 00:02:15.853
so that's more in the fearmongering category.

46
00:02:15.853 --> 00:02:19.106
Where the other camp is saying, "No, that's nonsense,

47
00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:20.408
"that's not what it's about,

48
00:02:20.408 --> 00:02:22.264
"it's simply the end of one time,

49
00:02:22.264 --> 00:02:23.981
"and the birth of another."

50
00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:28.162
Okay, so then let's go into how this came about

51
00:02:28.162 --> 00:02:30.935
to begin with in terms of the understanding.

52
00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:34.796
The Mayans were very astute observers of the stars,

53
00:02:34.796 --> 00:02:36.161
is that correct?

54
00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:38.135
<v ->Yeah, they were cosmologists,</v>

55
00:02:39.245 --> 00:02:40.934
they blended all these different things

56
00:02:40.934 --> 00:02:43.862
into one unified perspective.

57
00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:48.422
Their science and their religion was unified, you might say,

58
00:02:48.422 --> 00:02:51.516
so they sort of defy categorizing in a sense,

59
00:02:51.516 --> 00:02:54.001
but yeah, they were tuned into the stars,

60
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:57.478
and they were able to understand certain things

61
00:02:57.478 --> 00:02:59.995
about the great cycles of time,

62
00:02:59.995 --> 00:03:02.448
the great cycles that surround us.

63
00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:04.379
And they did tune into this big cycle,

64
00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.149
the precession of the equinoxes.

65
00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:07.611
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about that a little bit,</v>

66
00:03:07.611 --> 00:03:11.162
because that's starting to come up more often now.

67
00:03:11.162 --> 00:03:12.688
What exactly does that mean,

68
00:03:12.688 --> 00:03:14.437
the precession of the equinoxes?

69
00:03:14.437 --> 00:03:16.154
And then we'll talk about how they were able

70
00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:18.426
to kind of cast timelines in there.

71
00:03:18.426 --> 00:03:22.074
<v ->Sure, well precession is basically the fact</v>

72
00:03:22.074 --> 00:03:24.026
that the stars shift,

73
00:03:24.026 --> 00:03:26.788
so our orientation to the larger universe

74
00:03:26.788 --> 00:03:28.708
is constantly shifting.

75
00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:32.174
And the way that astronomers measure this

76
00:03:32.174 --> 00:03:34.468
is with the equinox point,

77
00:03:34.468 --> 00:03:36.910
so the position of the sun on the equinox

78
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.718
in relation to background features like the stars,

79
00:03:40.718 --> 00:03:42.691
is constantly shifting and that's why we're approaching

80
00:03:42.691 --> 00:03:44.643
the Age of Aquarius,

81
00:03:44.643 --> 00:03:46.595
is because the equinox is shifting

82
00:03:46.595 --> 00:03:49.816
into a new sign in the zodiac.

83
00:03:49.816 --> 00:03:52.098
Well, the Maya were tuned into this process,

84
00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:55.874
and a full cycle is 26,000 years.

85
00:03:55.874 --> 00:03:58.018
So, you know, astronomers recognize this,

86
00:03:58.018 --> 00:03:59.778
and they have their ways of calculating it,

87
00:03:59.778 --> 00:04:00.941
but what does it mean?

88
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:03.479
What does it mean for human beings on earth?

89
00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.986
<v Voiceover>When you go through a full 26,000 year cycle?</v>

90
00:04:05.986 --> 00:04:08.765
<v ->Exactly, and where are the beginning points,</v>

91
00:04:08.765 --> 00:04:09.857
where are the endpoints

92
00:04:09.857 --> 00:04:11.489
and the beginning points of this cycle?

93
00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.240
Well, the Maya had an insight about this cycle.

94
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.562
Their insight, I guess you'd basically say,

95
00:04:18.562 --> 00:04:20.876
that their perspective on this cycle

96
00:04:20.876 --> 00:04:22.967
is that it's not so much a circle,

97
00:04:22.967 --> 00:04:24.780
which it's hard to sort of figure out

98
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.190
where the beginning and end of a circle is.

99
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.233
It's more like a breathing out and a breathing in.

100
00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:34.326
So, human beings in human culture,

101
00:04:34.326 --> 00:04:39.259
and we on earth are coming into closer union,

102
00:04:40.745 --> 00:04:42.773
as we breathe in, in the cycle of precession,

103
00:04:42.773 --> 00:04:44.639
we're coming into closer union

104
00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.932
with our cosmic heart and source.

105
00:04:46.932 --> 00:04:49.772
And as we breathe out in the great cycle of precession,

106
00:04:49.772 --> 00:04:51.519
we're getting further and further away

107
00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:53.439
from our cosmic heart and source.

108
00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:54.783
So it's not so much a circle,

109
00:04:54.783 --> 00:04:57.898
it's a moving in and a moving out.

110
00:04:57.898 --> 00:04:59.711
And the insight that the Maya had

111
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:04.468
is that the beginning points of this great cycle

112
00:05:04.468 --> 00:05:07.124
is when we come into union

113
00:05:07.124 --> 00:05:09.609
with the center of our Milky Way galaxy.

114
00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:13.417
And that does happen, it happens once every 26,000 years,

115
00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:15.251
in the cycle of precession,

116
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:17.736
and that's what 2012 is really about,

117
00:05:17.736 --> 00:05:19.761
because in the years around 2012,

118
00:05:20.751 --> 00:05:23.305
the December solstice sun is lining up

119
00:05:23.305 --> 00:05:25.577
with the center of our Milky Way galaxy.

120
00:05:25.577 --> 00:05:26.793
<v Voiceover>So what you have done</v>

121
00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:28.980
is taken the ancient wisdom and knowledge

122
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.211
that's there for anyone to look at if they can interpret it

123
00:05:32.211 --> 00:05:34.259
in the tablets, et cetera,

124
00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:39.114
and you have overlaid it with some cool software

125
00:05:39.114 --> 00:05:41.204
called Easy Cosmos, basically,

126
00:05:41.204 --> 00:05:44.517
you've taken it and you've put the various,

127
00:05:44.517 --> 00:05:45.844
what would you call them,

128
00:05:45.844 --> 00:05:49.193
the fixed points in, to calculate what actually happens

129
00:05:49.193 --> 00:05:52.830
on the day of December 21st, 2012,

130
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.302
and what did you find?

131
00:05:54.302 --> 00:05:57.683
<v ->Well, I found that there's a very rare alignment</v>

132
00:05:57.683 --> 00:05:58.899
that's happening there,

133
00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:01.704
and the Maya were tuned into this alignment.

134
00:06:01.704 --> 00:06:03.635
And it's an astronomical fact

135
00:06:03.635 --> 00:06:07.048
that for many thousands of years,

136
00:06:07.048 --> 00:06:09.085
the December solstice sun,

137
00:06:09.085 --> 00:06:11.549
which the Maya called First Father,

138
00:06:11.549 --> 00:06:13.384
the First Solar Lord,

139
00:06:13.384 --> 00:06:16.445
has been slowly moving through the stars,

140
00:06:16.445 --> 00:06:18.215
through the constellations,

141
00:06:18.215 --> 00:06:21.821
and as we've been getting closer and closer to 2012,

142
00:06:21.821 --> 00:06:24.210
it's coming into union with the bright band

143
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.140
of the Milky Way galaxy.

144
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.084
And specifically, that part of the our Milky Way galaxy

145
00:06:29.084 --> 00:06:31.012
that contains the galactic center,

146
00:06:33.492 --> 00:06:36.134
it's right between Sagittarius and Scorpio.

147
00:06:36.134 --> 00:06:38.640
So in the years around 2012,

148
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.267
the First Solar Lord is lining up with the galactic center,

149
00:06:42.267 --> 00:06:44.265
and the galactic center, the Maya thought of

150
00:06:44.265 --> 00:06:47.824
as the Cosmic Womb of the Great Mother,

151
00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:50.565
the cosmic heart and source of the universe.

152
00:06:50.565 --> 00:06:53.648
So it's the union of Cosmic Mother and Cosmic Father,

153
00:06:53.648 --> 00:06:55.247
and that's what's culminating

154
00:06:55.247 --> 00:06:56.972
in the years around 2012.

155
00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:01.051
<v Voiceover>So, they created a calendar</v>

156
00:07:01.051 --> 00:07:03.760
that would lead us,

157
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.556
the people in this period of time,

158
00:07:06.556 --> 00:07:09.574
to these understandings when the time came,

159
00:07:09.574 --> 00:07:11.153
it appears.

160
00:07:11.153 --> 00:07:14.107
Can you just give us a very brief overview

161
00:07:14.107 --> 00:07:16.735
of how that calendar is constructed,

162
00:07:16.735 --> 00:07:19.771
and why you think they would have done that?

163
00:07:19.771 --> 00:07:23.440
Why they would have had such a far vision and bothered?

164
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.501
I mean, there's a lot of work that has gone into this,

165
00:07:26.501 --> 00:07:29.594
a lot of information left behind to be rediscovered.

166
00:07:29.594 --> 00:07:31.706
<v ->Well, to answer the first part,</v>

167
00:07:31.706 --> 00:07:33.402
or the second part first,

168
00:07:33.402 --> 00:07:36.207
it's because the alignment in question

169
00:07:36.207 --> 00:07:39.183
is like the supreme transformative moment

170
00:07:39.183 --> 00:07:40.548
for human history.

171
00:07:40.548 --> 00:07:43.919
And it's the supreme moment of opportunity

172
00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:48.441
for human beings to come back into union

173
00:07:48.441 --> 00:07:51.516
with our higher divine selves.

174
00:07:51.516 --> 00:07:56.505
And okay, to get into the Long Count calendar,

175
00:07:56.505 --> 00:08:00.184
is the calendar that's the 2012 calendar,

176
00:08:00.184 --> 00:08:04.643
and it's basically made up of five place values,

177
00:08:04.643 --> 00:08:06.691
and they're sort of like nested cycles

178
00:08:06.691 --> 00:08:08.525
of periods of days.

179
00:08:08.525 --> 00:08:13.101
The smallest cycle is the day cycle, the kin,

180
00:08:13.101 --> 00:08:14.669
and then there's 20 days,

181
00:08:14.669 --> 00:08:16.151
which is the uinal.

182
00:08:16.151 --> 00:08:18.007
Then there's 360 days,

183
00:08:18.007 --> 00:08:19.618
which is the tun period,

184
00:08:19.618 --> 00:08:21.772
it's almost a year, just under a year.

185
00:08:21.772 --> 00:08:25.879
And then 20 of those tuns is a katun,

186
00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:27.191
and that's just under 20 years,

187
00:08:27.191 --> 00:08:28.855
some people think that it relates

188
00:08:28.855 --> 00:08:31.948
to the conjunction cycles of Jupiter and Saturn,

189
00:08:31.948 --> 00:08:34.241
which is just under 20 years.

190
00:08:34.241 --> 00:08:38.448
And then the cycle of the baktun

191
00:08:38.448 --> 00:08:40.359
is 20 katuns,

192
00:08:40.359 --> 00:08:42.268
and that's just under 400 years.

193
00:08:42.268 --> 00:08:44.480
<v Voiceover>And that's 144,000 days?</v>

194
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.503
<v ->That's right.</v>

195
00:08:45.503 --> 00:08:47.075
<v Voiceover>Which is really quite interesting,</v>

196
00:08:47.075 --> 00:08:48.653
'cause this number appears in the bible,

197
00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:52.877
what is it that is sacred about 144,000?

198
00:08:52.877 --> 00:08:55.042
<v ->Well, I think it's one of those interesting numbers,</v>

199
00:08:55.042 --> 00:08:57.976
it's 12 squared times 1,000,

200
00:08:57.976 --> 00:09:00.898
so it's one of those interesting numerological numbers.

201
00:09:00.898 --> 00:09:04.450
And the Maya were very, very interested

202
00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:05.932
in how numbers relate

203
00:09:05.932 --> 00:09:08.748
to the sacred signs principles of the cosmos.

204
00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:11.809
They really had a sacred science,

205
00:09:11.809 --> 00:09:14.924
in which they understood how in nature,

206
00:09:14.924 --> 00:09:17.900
in plant growth, in the growth of trees,

207
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.242
in the unfolding of human beings,

208
00:09:21.742 --> 00:09:24.834
there are these number cycles,

209
00:09:24.834 --> 00:09:26.786
and they're not just simply numbers,

210
00:09:26.786 --> 00:09:28.940
these numbers have qualities.

211
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.988
Like, for example,

212
00:09:30.988 --> 00:09:34.243
the core building block of the Maya calendar systems

213
00:09:35.272 --> 00:09:39.725
is 13, it's a 13 base philosophy of time,

214
00:09:39.725 --> 00:09:41.282
you might say.

215
00:09:41.282 --> 00:09:43.490
And the reason why 13 is important to the Maya

216
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.436
is because there are 13 phases of the moon.

217
00:09:47.436 --> 00:09:49.324
This might seem a little counterintuitive

218
00:09:49.324 --> 00:09:52.684
because the moon cycle is 29.6 days,

219
00:09:52.684 --> 00:09:55.148
and half of that is 14.8,

220
00:09:55.148 --> 00:09:58.934
but the Maya were not interested in abstractions like that,

221
00:09:58.934 --> 00:10:00.854
you know, using numbers as some kind

222
00:10:00.854 --> 00:10:02.923
of calculational abstraction.

223
00:10:02.923 --> 00:10:07.541
What they actually saw is that when the moon first appears

224
00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:10.453
in the western sky as a little sliver,

225
00:10:10.453 --> 00:10:12.757
the first sliver of the new moon,

226
00:10:12.757 --> 00:10:15.264
it's actually like a day after a moon dark,

227
00:10:15.264 --> 00:10:17.173
so when they count from that first appearance

228
00:10:17.173 --> 00:10:18.238
of the new moon,

229
00:10:18.238 --> 00:10:20.288
1, 2, 3, 4, until it's full,

230
00:10:20.288 --> 00:10:22.037
it's 13 days.
<v Voiceover>13 days.</v>

231
00:10:22.037 --> 00:10:25.802
<v John>So that's really a philosophy in which</v>

232
00:10:25.802 --> 00:10:29.231
they see things unfolding to,

233
00:10:30.346 --> 00:10:31.903
it's really a philosophy of time

234
00:10:31.903 --> 00:10:36.543
in which things are born and they grow,

235
00:10:36.543 --> 00:10:39.178
and they maximize, and then they decay,

236
00:10:39.178 --> 00:10:41.961
and they decrease, and then they're reborn.

237
00:10:41.961 --> 00:10:43.977
So the moon waxes to fullness,

238
00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:46.580
and then another 13 days it wanes,

239
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.478
and then it's reborn at moon dark,

240
00:10:48.478 --> 00:10:51.983
and it's this beautiful cyclic cosmology of time.

241
00:10:52.989 --> 00:10:56.272
<v Voiceover>So it's not just the Mayans</v>

242
00:10:56.272 --> 00:10:58.782
that had this understanding either, is it?

243
00:11:00.046 --> 00:11:02.927
Isn't there evidence within Egyptology, et cetera,

244
00:11:02.927 --> 00:11:04.537
that this time was coming,

245
00:11:04.537 --> 00:11:06.884
perhaps counted a slightly different way?

246
00:11:06.884 --> 00:11:09.412
Can you comment on some of the other ancient cultures

247
00:11:09.412 --> 00:11:11.267
that had this same awareness

248
00:11:11.267 --> 00:11:13.401
and were astute observers of stars as well?

249
00:11:13.401 --> 00:11:16.974
<v ->Sure, sure, ancient cultures around the globe</v>

250
00:11:16.974 --> 00:11:20.067
were tuned into this insight,

251
00:11:20.067 --> 00:11:21.965
into the cyclic nature of time.

252
00:11:21.965 --> 00:11:23.853
And it works on the moon cycle,

253
00:11:23.853 --> 00:11:25.614
on the level of the moon cycle.

254
00:11:25.614 --> 00:11:27.470
It works in the solar year cycle,

255
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.774
and it works in these vast cycles of time

256
00:11:29.774 --> 00:11:31.907
like the precession of the equinoxes.

257
00:11:31.907 --> 00:11:35.219
For example, one example I would bring up would be

258
00:11:36.505 --> 00:11:39.683
the Hindu Yuga system.

259
00:11:39.683 --> 00:11:42.457
The Yugas are periods of time,

260
00:11:42.457 --> 00:11:45.475
and it's part of a world age doctrine,

261
00:11:45.475 --> 00:11:49.198
very much like the Maya had their own world age doctrine.

262
00:11:49.198 --> 00:11:51.491
And most world age doctrine's have to do with

263
00:11:51.491 --> 00:11:53.165
these vast cycles of time.

264
00:11:53.165 --> 00:11:54.253
<v Voiceover>Like the Bronze Age?</v>

265
00:11:54.253 --> 00:11:57.165
<v ->Yes, and most of these world age doctrines</v>

266
00:11:57.165 --> 00:12:00.994
are definitely connected with the precessional cycle.

267
00:12:00.994 --> 00:12:03.778
So the Yuga system, like the Greek system you mentioned

268
00:12:03.778 --> 00:12:05.987
in which, you know, you have the Golden Age,

269
00:12:05.987 --> 00:12:08.536
and the Silver Age, and the Bronze Age,

270
00:12:08.536 --> 00:12:10.285
and then the Iron Age,

271
00:12:10.285 --> 00:12:12.051
the Yuga system is like that.

272
00:12:14.041 --> 00:12:17.120
In the Yuga world age doctrine,

273
00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.541
basically about 13,000 years ago,

274
00:12:19.541 --> 00:12:21.301
there was a Golden Age,

275
00:12:21.301 --> 00:12:23.296
and human beings were connected

276
00:12:23.296 --> 00:12:25.877
into their cosmic heart and source.

277
00:12:25.877 --> 00:12:27.216
There was a direct,

278
00:12:31.008 --> 00:12:33.515
I guess you might say that the perennial wisdom

279
00:12:33.515 --> 00:12:36.693
was visible for all to see.

280
00:12:36.693 --> 00:12:39.744
<v Voiceover>And these were considered higher civilizations</v>

281
00:12:39.744 --> 00:12:41.546
as well, in terms of understandings,

282
00:12:41.546 --> 00:12:43.552
and mathematics, astronomy, et cetera.

283
00:12:43.552 --> 00:12:44.938
<v ->That's right.</v>

284
00:12:44.938 --> 00:12:46.474
And that's somewhat counterintuitive too,

285
00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:48.906
because today in the western science model,

286
00:12:48.906 --> 00:12:51.743
we have this idea of progress,

287
00:12:51.743 --> 00:12:55.412
that our primitive ancestors were less sophisticated

288
00:12:55.412 --> 00:12:57.545
than us in all ways.

289
00:12:57.545 --> 00:13:01.865
But this Hindu idea is actually the reverse of that,

290
00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:03.540
and I'll explain why in a moment,

291
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.955
it's because 13,000 years ago,

292
00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:09.598
if that was the Golden Age

293
00:13:09.598 --> 00:13:11.514
and human beings were much more sophisticated

294
00:13:11.514 --> 00:13:12.672
and enlightened,

295
00:13:12.672 --> 00:13:16.479
and you know, turned on at that time,

296
00:13:16.479 --> 00:13:19.060
then there's a degradation that took place.

297
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.533
<v Voiceover>Yes, the Dark Ages. (laughs)</v>

298
00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:21.752
<v ->The Dark Ages came,</v>

299
00:13:21.752 --> 00:13:24.425
we moved into greater years of spiritual degradation,

300
00:13:24.425 --> 00:13:25.993
and spiritual darkness.

301
00:13:25.993 --> 00:13:29.289
Well, that's just part of the natural cycles of time,

302
00:13:29.289 --> 00:13:31.369
because as with the moon cycle,

303
00:13:31.369 --> 00:13:35.199
half of that is cycle is when the moon is moving from full,

304
00:13:35.199 --> 00:13:37.482
to increasing darkness,

305
00:13:37.482 --> 00:13:40.105
and then it's reborn in complete darkness.

306
00:13:40.105 --> 00:13:42.473
And then, the other half of the cycle,

307
00:13:42.473 --> 00:13:45.673
and this is part of what 2012 is about,

308
00:13:45.673 --> 00:13:48.670
is the other phase or the other half

309
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.038
is the half in which we are increasing

310
00:13:51.038 --> 00:13:53.843
towards the next Golden Age.

311
00:13:53.843 --> 00:13:57.235
So 2012, really is sort of the anchor point

312
00:13:57.235 --> 00:13:58.792
of this shift.

313
00:13:58.792 --> 00:14:01.733
<v Voiceover>So you could say it's really the nadir.</v>

314
00:14:01.733 --> 00:14:06.333
(laughs) Which, I mean that has some golden lining to it,

315
00:14:06.333 --> 00:14:10.130
which is simply that we are able to start increasing

316
00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.933
our consciousness from that point forward,

317
00:14:11.933 --> 00:14:15.122
but it also means we've sunken to some pretty low depths

318
00:14:15.122 --> 00:14:16.489
of consciousness on one level.

319
00:14:16.489 --> 00:14:17.501
<v ->Yes, that's true,</v>

320
00:14:17.501 --> 00:14:20.637
but there's a very special energetic quality

321
00:14:20.637 --> 00:14:22.706
about the nadir,

322
00:14:22.706 --> 00:14:24.402
because it's the still point.

323
00:14:24.402 --> 00:14:27.891
It's analogous to, in Vipassana meditation,

324
00:14:27.891 --> 00:14:30.098
and this is why I used the analogy of the breathing out

325
00:14:30.098 --> 00:14:31.656
and breathing in earlier.

326
00:14:31.656 --> 00:14:33.352
In Vipassana meditation,

327
00:14:33.352 --> 00:14:35.943
which is based on focusing on the breath,

328
00:14:35.943 --> 00:14:40.263
there's a special focus on the breathing cycle,

329
00:14:40.263 --> 00:14:43.954
and the maximum outbreath is a still point,

330
00:14:43.954 --> 00:14:46.652
and that's analogous to what this nadir is about,

331
00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:48.924
the 2012 still point transition

332
00:14:48.924 --> 00:14:51.740
from increasing darkness to increasing light.

333
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.988
In that still point, we have a great opportunity

334
00:14:54.988 --> 00:14:57.457
to transcend time,

335
00:14:57.457 --> 00:15:00.199
to catch a glimpse of that perennial wisdom.

336
00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:01.585
<v Voiceover>And doesn't it appear</v>

337
00:15:01.585 --> 00:15:04.380
that there is a greater duality

338
00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:08.017
that also seems to be forming at this time,

339
00:15:08.017 --> 00:15:09.873
where you have consciousness that's shifting

340
00:15:09.873 --> 00:15:13.264
into really, almost a dullard status,

341
00:15:13.264 --> 00:15:17.243
our senses being so dulled by exterior stimuli

342
00:15:17.243 --> 00:15:18.309
in the material world,

343
00:15:18.309 --> 00:15:20.368
and then the other part, which are people

344
00:15:20.368 --> 00:15:22.459
who are really searching for something

345
00:15:22.459 --> 00:15:24.346
beyond the material world.

346
00:15:24.346 --> 00:15:26.597
It does seem some polarity is--

347
00:15:26.597 --> 00:15:28.410
<v ->That's kind of what I refer to</v>

348
00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.725
as the end times dynamic.

349
00:15:30.725 --> 00:15:32.559
At the end of a cycle,

350
00:15:32.559 --> 00:15:35.696
this is just sort of an insight into the energetic

351
00:15:35.696 --> 00:15:38.234
properties or things that emerge at the end of a cycle,

352
00:15:38.234 --> 00:15:40.485
like you say, there does seem to be

353
00:15:40.485 --> 00:15:42.618
an increasing polarity in the world today.

354
00:15:42.618 --> 00:15:45.178
Things are pulling apart and getting defined

355
00:15:45.178 --> 00:15:47.755
to opposite extremes.

356
00:15:47.755 --> 00:15:49.487
And that is just part of the process

357
00:15:49.487 --> 00:15:51.898
because out of that extreme duality,

358
00:15:51.898 --> 00:15:53.647
out of that extreme polarity,

359
00:15:53.647 --> 00:15:54.831
and there's a lot of craziness

360
00:15:54.831 --> 00:15:56.847
that happens during those times.

361
00:15:56.847 --> 00:15:59.311
A lot of the shadows in our civilization,

362
00:15:59.311 --> 00:16:00.750
and in our own personal lives,

363
00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.568
are coming out of the closet,

364
00:16:03.568 --> 00:16:06.117
screaming for attention, screaming to be integrated,

365
00:16:06.117 --> 00:16:08.485
so that we can achieve a kind of wholeness.

366
00:16:08.485 --> 00:16:10.458
And when these polarities reach

367
00:16:10.458 --> 00:16:13.668
their extreme maximum extension,

368
00:16:13.668 --> 00:16:17.498
it's in that middle, that middle point is found.

369
00:16:17.498 --> 00:16:20.697
So in a sense, like polarities as they manifest

370
00:16:20.697 --> 00:16:22.137
at the end of a historical cycle,

371
00:16:22.137 --> 00:16:24.164
like we have going on now,

372
00:16:24.164 --> 00:16:27.833
it can give rise to these crazy situations

373
00:16:27.833 --> 00:16:31.033
of like, if you're not with us, you're against us,

374
00:16:31.033 --> 00:16:32.451
or it's us against them,

375
00:16:32.451 --> 00:16:33.870
these kind of situations.

376
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.747
<v Voiceover>As evidenced everywhere right now.</v>

377
00:16:35.747 --> 00:16:37.976
<v ->But for those who can walk the middle path</v>

378
00:16:37.976 --> 00:16:40.184
and balance the two extremes,

379
00:16:40.184 --> 00:16:43.363
that's the path through to the future.

380
00:16:43.363 --> 00:16:45.240
<v Voiceover>And staying out of judgement</v>

381
00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.285
as to what's going on,

382
00:16:46.285 --> 00:16:48.749
because it's each individual soul's way

383
00:16:48.749 --> 00:16:50.493
of contending with it.

384
00:16:54.988 --> 00:16:58.073
There is the work of a man named John Derring,

385
00:16:58.073 --> 00:17:01.123
talking about other influences that are affecting this,

386
00:17:01.123 --> 00:17:03.886
so you're talking about the cosmological effect

387
00:17:03.886 --> 00:17:05.411
of the precession of the equinox,

388
00:17:05.411 --> 00:17:08.020
and the elders innate understanding,

389
00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.743
higher wisdom that we are experiencing right now.

390
00:17:11.743 --> 00:17:15.636
Basically, laying this out for us to see when the time came.

391
00:17:15.636 --> 00:17:16.958
But what about the notion,

392
00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.795
if you care to comment on other factors coming into play,

393
00:17:19.795 --> 00:17:21.833
such as electromagnetism?

394
00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:24.158
The magnetic fields that are going on,

395
00:17:24.158 --> 00:17:26.824
pulling further away as we reach the nadir,

396
00:17:26.824 --> 00:17:31.005
aren't the fields considered to be somewhat more dissipated,

397
00:17:31.005 --> 00:17:32.328
so to speak?

398
00:17:32.328 --> 00:17:34.220
The magnetic fields?

399
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.594
<v ->That could be from a scientific perspective,</v>

400
00:17:36.594 --> 00:17:39.634
as science tries to language or explain

401
00:17:39.634 --> 00:17:42.979
in empirical terms why there's so much

402
00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:46.082
accelerating transformation going on in the world today.

403
00:17:47.549 --> 00:17:49.959
You know, we can talk about magnetic fields,

404
00:17:49.959 --> 00:17:54.236
we can talk about electrical energetic fields,

405
00:17:54.236 --> 00:17:58.044
and as I see it in the great cycle of precession,

406
00:17:58.044 --> 00:18:01.340
we've been moving closer and closer

407
00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.774
towards that still point maximum.

408
00:18:04.774 --> 00:18:08.444
So, in one of my books, Galactic Alignment,

409
00:18:08.444 --> 00:18:12.390
I drew from a scientist and philosopher,

410
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.797
Oliver Reiser, he had this model in which

411
00:18:17.382 --> 00:18:20.891
once every precession cycle for some reason,

412
00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:22.534
the energetic fields of the earth,

413
00:18:22.534 --> 00:18:26.043
there's like this diminishing or this null point,

414
00:18:26.043 --> 00:18:29.733
and so the protective cover that the ionosphere,

415
00:18:29.733 --> 00:18:32.944
the magnetic belt around the earth protects us

416
00:18:32.944 --> 00:18:36.733
from all these incidental rays that could do great harm,

417
00:18:36.733 --> 00:18:40.133
that there's an evolutionary event that happens.

418
00:18:40.133 --> 00:18:42.778
And now, I personally think that this is kind of

419
00:18:42.778 --> 00:18:44.772
too ingrained in the Darwinian model

420
00:18:44.772 --> 00:18:47.674
of the evolution of physiological forms

421
00:18:47.674 --> 00:18:49.625
over vast periods of time.

422
00:18:49.625 --> 00:18:52.036
But I think that the human mind, consciousness,

423
00:18:52.036 --> 00:18:55.310
responds more quickly to these energetic changes.

424
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.561
So it is an astronomical fact

425
00:18:57.561 --> 00:19:00.515
that we are, in the years around 2012,

426
00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:03.459
are the axis of the solstices,

427
00:19:03.459 --> 00:19:06.990
the solstice axis, with precession is lining up

428
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.835
with the center of the Milky Way galaxy.

429
00:19:08.835 --> 00:19:10.851
Now to me, that is a very compelling,

430
00:19:10.851 --> 00:19:12.547
and very empirical,

431
00:19:12.547 --> 00:19:14.616
I mean, astronomers have calculated it,

432
00:19:14.616 --> 00:19:18.562
it to me is the empirical signifier.

433
00:19:18.562 --> 00:19:23.159
The event in which we sort of line up

434
00:19:23.159 --> 00:19:26.823
with that which can transform us.

435
00:19:27.949 --> 00:19:30.082
And I also just wanna say one other thing too,

436
00:19:30.082 --> 00:19:34.045
is that science is struggling to language these things,

437
00:19:35.229 --> 00:19:38.975
and I think that a really more interesting

438
00:19:40.492 --> 00:19:43.461
place to look is Native American traditions,

439
00:19:43.461 --> 00:19:45.530
because they have an intuition

440
00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.482
as to what these cycles (mumbles).

441
00:19:47.482 --> 00:19:49.146
They can look at the moon cycle,

442
00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:51.119
and they can meditate deeply,

443
00:19:51.119 --> 00:19:52.911
not just analyzing the moon cycle

444
00:19:52.911 --> 00:19:54.330
from a scientific perspective,

445
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:58.852
but meditate deeply on what the meaning of that cycle is,

446
00:19:58.852 --> 00:20:03.744
and thereby gain a real inner understanding in the heart

447
00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:07.476
about these larger cycles including the big cycle,

448
00:20:09.253 --> 00:20:12.638
towards which we are about to complete right now.

449
00:20:12.638 --> 00:20:14.516
<v Voiceover>And they have a beautiful saying,</v>

450
00:20:14.516 --> 00:20:15.796
you might know it by heart,

451
00:20:15.796 --> 00:20:17.630
I just remember little snippets of it,

452
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.233
talking about the elders released information

453
00:20:20.233 --> 00:20:23.059
to the public at large, which was very rare,

454
00:20:23.059 --> 00:20:24.915
talking about these times saying,

455
00:20:24.915 --> 00:20:27.496
"This is a time where we need to let go

456
00:20:27.496 --> 00:20:30.259
"of the grass on the banks of the rivers,

457
00:20:30.259 --> 00:20:32.978
"and allow ourselves to be swept into the river

458
00:20:32.978 --> 00:20:36.082
"without fear and see who's there with you."

459
00:20:36.082 --> 00:20:37.757
<v ->Beautiful, that's beautiful,</v>

460
00:20:37.757 --> 00:20:39.730
and it reminds me of the teaching

461
00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.959
that's encoded in the Maya creation myth,

462
00:20:41.959 --> 00:20:44.740
which really is a spiritual teaching.

463
00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.357
In my book, Maya Cosmogenesis 2012,

464
00:20:47.357 --> 00:20:49.607
I showed how the Maya creation myth

465
00:20:49.607 --> 00:20:54.183
is encoding the astronomy that culminates in 2012,

466
00:20:54.183 --> 00:20:57.607
and it has to do with the First Solar Lord

467
00:20:57.607 --> 00:20:59.623
coming into union with the Cosmic Mother,

468
00:20:59.623 --> 00:21:01.852
and that's all encoded in the creation myth.

469
00:21:01.852 --> 00:21:05.052
But there's also this very profound spiritual teaching

470
00:21:05.052 --> 00:21:06.470
encoded in the creation myth,

471
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:09.329
and it has to do with letting go,

472
00:21:09.329 --> 00:21:11.746
letting go of our illusions.

473
00:21:11.746 --> 00:21:15.367
And that has to do with how much we cling to our egos,

474
00:21:15.367 --> 00:21:17.617
or our individual selves,

475
00:21:17.617 --> 00:21:19.644
or what I like to say more,

476
00:21:19.644 --> 00:21:21.820
is that we cling to our illusions,

477
00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.166
and that keeps us in a place of limitation.

478
00:21:24.166 --> 00:21:26.907
And the reason why we cling to our illusions

479
00:21:26.907 --> 00:21:28.443
is because we're afraid.

480
00:21:28.443 --> 00:21:29.766
We're afraid of the unknown,

481
00:21:29.766 --> 00:21:31.185
we're afraid to let go.

482
00:21:33.533 --> 00:21:36.439
What it really boils down to in regards to 2012,

483
00:21:36.439 --> 00:21:39.340
in regards to really any traumatic event

484
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.516
or decision that we have to make in our lives,

485
00:21:41.516 --> 00:21:43.468
we can choose to respond to that

486
00:21:43.468 --> 00:21:45.770
with fear, or love.

487
00:21:46.772 --> 00:21:47.893
<v Voiceover>Would you say that the Mayans</v>

488
00:21:47.893 --> 00:21:49.759
were concerned about us,

489
00:21:49.759 --> 00:21:51.434
at this point in history,

490
00:21:51.434 --> 00:21:53.588
and that is why they went to the extent they did

491
00:21:53.588 --> 00:21:56.799
to leave this information behind for us

492
00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:59.657
so we would know when the times were coming?

493
00:21:59.657 --> 00:22:01.321
<v ->I think that that's probably true.</v>

494
00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:04.766
I think that the Maya have a universal,

495
00:22:04.766 --> 00:22:07.017
sort of galactic perspective on things,

496
00:22:07.017 --> 00:22:09.054
so I think they were concerned about humanity,

497
00:22:09.054 --> 00:22:12.211
they were concerned about the future survival of humanity,

498
00:22:12.211 --> 00:22:13.512
because in their creation myth,

499
00:22:13.512 --> 00:22:16.750
they also talk about, it's a world age doctrine,

500
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:21.498
so they talk about the previous world age,

501
00:22:21.498 --> 00:22:23.124
the ending of the previous world age.

502
00:22:23.124 --> 00:22:24.513
<v Voiceover>And what do they say about that?</v>

503
00:22:24.513 --> 00:22:27.339
<v ->Well, they say it's spoken of in metaphors,</v>

504
00:22:27.339 --> 00:22:29.706
like human beings, when the flood came,

505
00:22:29.706 --> 00:22:31.722
human beings had to transform into fish

506
00:22:31.722 --> 00:22:33.375
in order to survive,

507
00:22:33.375 --> 00:22:35.818
and there's three other world ages that end.

508
00:22:35.818 --> 00:22:38.548
But the point is that human beings always have

509
00:22:38.548 --> 00:22:41.780
to transform themselves into something completely new

510
00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.287
in order to survive into the next era.

511
00:22:44.287 --> 00:22:46.356
And they do that, human beings can do that,

512
00:22:46.356 --> 00:22:48.304
by opening up,

513
00:22:49.482 --> 00:22:51.083
in love, opening up,

514
00:22:51.083 --> 00:22:52.864
not clamping down in fear, but opening up

515
00:22:52.864 --> 00:22:55.402
to the transformative energies of the universe.

516
00:22:55.402 --> 00:22:57.653
It's like there's nothing to fear

517
00:22:57.653 --> 00:22:59.648
with what the universe is up to,

518
00:22:59.648 --> 00:23:02.266
the universe is trying to evolve us.

519
00:23:03.637 --> 00:23:06.613
Our own spiritual evolution is not so much something we do

520
00:23:06.613 --> 00:23:09.483
but something like a blessing that we open up to.

521
00:23:09.483 --> 00:23:11.083
<v Voiceover>So that was their gift,</v>

522
00:23:11.083 --> 00:23:14.080
that was the Mayan gift to us?

523
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.931
<v ->I think that the Maya gift to us,</v>

524
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.766
specifically in regards to 2012,

525
00:23:19.766 --> 00:23:22.347
and it's kind of, sort of a half miracle,

526
00:23:22.347 --> 00:23:24.555
that the stones of Izapa,

527
00:23:24.555 --> 00:23:29.238
the carvings of Izapa have survived down to us today.

528
00:23:29.238 --> 00:23:32.491
And Izapa is the place that invented the calendar

529
00:23:32.491 --> 00:23:34.656
that gives us the 2012 end date.

530
00:23:34.656 --> 00:23:37.227
So it's almost like, it was a sacred ceremonial site,

531
00:23:37.227 --> 00:23:41.248
it was an initiatory site into this cosmic wisdom,

532
00:23:41.248 --> 00:23:42.922
this galactic perspective,

533
00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:46.747
this alignment that occurs,

534
00:23:46.747 --> 00:23:50.688
and offers to transform human beings.

535
00:23:50.688 --> 00:23:54.772
So, I think that that is sort of like,

536
00:23:56.494 --> 00:23:58.647
the stones of Izapa, the carvings,

537
00:23:58.647 --> 00:24:00.758
and the message preserved at Izapa,

538
00:24:00.758 --> 00:24:05.334
is something that is preserved for us today.

539
00:24:05.334 --> 00:24:10.009
<v Voiceover>It seems to me then that the challenge for us,</v>

540
00:24:10.009 --> 00:24:12.226
certainly as a western culture,

541
00:24:12.226 --> 00:24:14.254
is to perhaps get over ourselves,

542
00:24:14.254 --> 00:24:16.077
get over our own arrogance,

543
00:24:16.077 --> 00:24:18.488
and our own understanding of science

544
00:24:18.488 --> 00:24:20.227
at this point in history,

545
00:24:20.227 --> 00:24:21.880
and begin to acknowledge

546
00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.037
that we weren't the first game around.

547
00:24:25.037 --> 00:24:28.983
<v ->Western civilization has a huge superiority complex.</v>

548
00:24:28.983 --> 00:24:31.469
They, especially the scientific paradigm,

549
00:24:31.469 --> 00:24:34.882
thinks it is the arbiter of all knowledge.

550
00:24:34.882 --> 00:24:37.036
It won't even use the term wisdom,

551
00:24:37.036 --> 00:24:38.572
because wisdom implies some kind

552
00:24:38.572 --> 00:24:40.940
of inner spiritual connection with truth.

553
00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.148
And the scientific model, the scientific method,

554
00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:45.996
doesn't really ascribe to the idea

555
00:24:45.996 --> 00:24:48.022
that you can come to any kind of understanding

556
00:24:48.022 --> 00:24:51.521
of the universe by delving within,

557
00:24:51.521 --> 00:24:54.262
or meditating deeply on something.

558
00:24:54.262 --> 00:24:56.907
The scientific model is all about data gathering

559
00:24:56.907 --> 00:24:58.992
and making postulations,

560
00:24:58.992 --> 00:25:01.504
and all these proofs.

561
00:25:01.504 --> 00:25:03.361
You know, that has it's place.

562
00:25:03.361 --> 00:25:04.807
The reason why,

563
00:25:06.455 --> 00:25:08.428
there was an ancient metaphysics,

564
00:25:08.428 --> 00:25:10.594
we speak of metaphysics,

565
00:25:10.594 --> 00:25:13.196
and metaphysics is really a physics

566
00:25:13.196 --> 00:25:16.513
that can include all the forces,

567
00:25:16.513 --> 00:25:18.092
and principles, and equations,

568
00:25:18.092 --> 00:25:20.129
that physics talks about,

569
00:25:20.129 --> 00:25:22.753
but there's also this meta perspective

570
00:25:22.753 --> 00:25:27.735
that embraces the component of human spirituality,

571
00:25:27.735 --> 00:25:30.379
and which you might say the physics

572
00:25:30.379 --> 00:25:32.470
of human spiritual transformation.

573
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:36.043
And you find this in many of the world's traditions.

574
00:25:36.043 --> 00:25:38.512
There's the metaphysics of spiritual transformation

575
00:25:38.512 --> 00:25:42.912
that are spoken of in like Tibetan mysticism,

576
00:25:42.912 --> 00:25:44.895
with the seven chakras,

577
00:25:44.895 --> 00:25:46.079
and the way that we can awaken

578
00:25:46.079 --> 00:25:48.053
the different spiritual centers

579
00:25:48.053 --> 00:25:51.103
by yoga and meditation,

580
00:25:51.103 --> 00:25:52.650
and that kind of thing.

581
00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.513
So, the point here is that the Maya also

582
00:25:55.513 --> 00:25:58.421
were tuned into this ancient metaphysics,

583
00:25:58.421 --> 00:26:02.133
or what I refer to as the perennial philosophy,

584
00:26:02.133 --> 00:26:05.034
and so the cosmology,

585
00:26:05.034 --> 00:26:06.986
and the spiritual teachings of the Maya,

586
00:26:06.986 --> 00:26:11.423
it's not just some backwater southern Mexico thing,

587
00:26:11.423 --> 00:26:14.889
it's really a beautiful, brilliant connection

588
00:26:14.889 --> 00:26:17.497
into the perennial philosophy.

589
00:26:18.623 --> 00:26:20.202
The primordial tradition,

590
00:26:20.202 --> 00:26:22.986
that tradition of our ancient ancestors

591
00:26:22.986 --> 00:26:26.281
that was directly aware in an immediate,

592
00:26:26.281 --> 00:26:29.065
gnostic, sort of internal sense,

593
00:26:29.065 --> 00:26:32.254
of the universal principles that create

594
00:26:32.254 --> 00:26:34.601
and sustain the universe.

595
00:26:34.601 --> 00:26:36.638
<v Voiceover>So from there, where are you headed,</v>

596
00:26:36.638 --> 00:26:39.955
as we start counting down, or counting up,

597
00:26:39.955 --> 00:26:42.792
(laughs) toward the beginning of the new cycle,

598
00:26:42.792 --> 00:26:44.808
where is this work taking you now?

599
00:26:44.808 --> 00:26:47.880
<v ->Well, I feel that I've sort of come full circle</v>

600
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.877
in the last 20 years or so,

601
00:26:50.877 --> 00:26:53.010
where I got launched into this path

602
00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:56.519
by my own inner awakening,

603
00:26:56.519 --> 00:26:59.762
my own work with yoga and meditation,

604
00:26:59.762 --> 00:27:01.511
and I've walked down this path

605
00:27:01.511 --> 00:27:04.316
of writing these books and doing this research,

606
00:27:04.316 --> 00:27:07.985
and I've come back to, you know,

607
00:27:07.985 --> 00:27:10.599
my own work to remain centered,

608
00:27:10.599 --> 00:27:13.405
and to be doing my own spiritual practice.

609
00:27:13.405 --> 00:27:16.775
I think that part of my own mission

610
00:27:16.775 --> 00:27:19.282
is really to be a teacher about these things.

611
00:27:19.282 --> 00:27:20.749
And to be a teacher,

612
00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:24.061
not about my own personal ideas

613
00:27:24.061 --> 00:27:26.152
or interpretations so much,

614
00:27:26.152 --> 00:27:28.519
I mean, I have my own sort of unique discoveries

615
00:27:28.519 --> 00:27:31.421
that I've made in terms of reconstructing

616
00:27:31.421 --> 00:27:33.736
the ancient Mayan wisdom.

617
00:27:33.736 --> 00:27:37.394
But I think that my mission is to be a conduit,

618
00:27:37.394 --> 00:27:41.298
or a conveyor of this ancient perennial tradition,

619
00:27:41.298 --> 00:27:43.613
the principles of transformation

620
00:27:43.613 --> 00:27:47.143
that we can all tune into.

621
00:27:47.143 --> 00:27:49.463
So as we get closer to 2012,

622
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:54.045
certainly there's gonna be a lot of,

623
00:27:54.045 --> 00:27:55.986
as you said, at the beginning of the interview,

624
00:27:55.986 --> 00:27:59.143
as you said, there's gonna be so much increasing interest,

625
00:27:59.143 --> 00:28:01.404
there's gonna be a lot of noise too.

626
00:28:01.404 --> 00:28:04.028
So I only hope to be a voice of clarity.

627
00:28:04.028 --> 00:28:07.241
(peaceful music)

628
00:28:07.241 --> 00:28:10.076
<v ->To understand more about the precession of the equinox,</v>

629
00:28:10.076 --> 00:28:13.628
the 26,000 year cosmic cycle of consciousness,

630
00:28:13.628 --> 00:28:15.889
check out our interview with Walter Cruttenden.

631
00:28:15.889 --> 00:28:18.907
Cruttenden is making waves in the world of astrophysics

632
00:28:18.907 --> 00:28:20.923
regarding the precession as well,

633
00:28:20.923 --> 00:28:23.195
only he has an amazing spin on it.

634
00:28:23.195 --> 00:28:25.872
Try this one on, we may have not one,

635
00:28:25.872 --> 00:28:27.867
but two suns.

636
00:28:27.867 --> 00:28:30.242
Until next time, thanks for watching.

637
00:28:30.242 --> 00:28:35.237
