00:00:00.498 --> 00:00:03.335
<v ->In our continued attempt to keep you informed of some</v>

2
00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:06.322
of the more insidious agendas that are becoming manifest,

3
00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:08.519
we spoke, once again, with Leuren Moret,

4
00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.100
the former Lawrence Livermore whistle blower.

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.300
In this conversation, Leuren speaks about global programs

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.775
for decreasing the world's population.

7
00:00:16.775 --> 00:00:18.824
Some of them are quite chilling, so you may want

8
00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:21.498
to brace yourself for some of this information.

00:00:21.498 --> 00:00:26.483 line:15% 
(soft rock music)

10
00:00:31.222 --> 00:00:32.907
<v Voiceover>In our last conversation, we were talking</v>

11
00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:37.089
about radiation and its poisonous effects on humanity,

12
00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:39.436
which has an awful lot of side effects,

13
00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:41.991
not the least of which is cancer and death,

14
00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:44.563
but another one is infertility.

15
00:00:44.563 --> 00:00:47.227
And the subject of infertility seems to be one

16
00:00:47.227 --> 00:00:49.894
that has so many components to it,

17
00:00:49.894 --> 00:00:52.591
and you're familiar with most of these components.

18
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:55.258
I really thought we needed to talk to you about this.

19
00:00:55.258 --> 00:00:57.434
This is becoming a big deal now.

20
00:00:57.434 --> 00:01:00.698
Let's begin, if you dont mind, off camera,

21
00:01:00.698 --> 00:01:03.535
you read something to me that I thought was really important

22
00:01:03.535 --> 00:01:05.052
for all of us to hear.

23
00:01:05.052 --> 00:01:06.524
Do you wanna go ahead and read this?

24
00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:07.526
Let's put it in the context.

25
00:01:07.526 --> 00:01:09.830
This is Bertrand Russell, right in the middle

26
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.369
of the good ol' boys club.

27
00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.780
Right in the middle of the good ol' boys club.

28
00:01:17.382 --> 00:01:19.004
Maybe expain who Bertrand Russell is

29
00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:21.777
and why it's important that he said these words.

30
00:01:21.777 --> 00:01:25.873
<v ->Bertrand Russell was a very famous mathematician</v>

31
00:01:25.873 --> 00:01:28.283
and philosopher in England.

32
00:01:28.283 --> 00:01:30.203
He was actually Scottish.

33
00:01:30.203 --> 00:01:33.787
He had a title, he was an Earl.

34
00:01:33.787 --> 00:01:38.033
So he was part of the established,

35
00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:41.250
titled gentry.

36
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.237
He was very, very influential.

37
00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:45.751
He knew many, many people.

38
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:50.751
He was certainly an insider on what was going on,

39
00:01:51.276 --> 00:01:56.247
the ideas that were being shared and proliferated

40
00:01:56.247 --> 00:02:00.273
at that time, what was politically correct.

41
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.996
This is what he said in his book,

42
00:02:05.996 --> 00:02:09.538
The Impact of Science on Society.

43
00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:14.538
It was published in 1952, but it was based on his lectures

44
00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:17.708
at Oxford in the 1930s.

45
00:02:17.708 --> 00:02:21.761
These are ideas that were already well established

46
00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:24.161
by the 1930s and in fact

47
00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:27.063
they go all the way back to the 1800's

48
00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:31.329
and even to Malthus in the 1700s,

49
00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.329
who came up with this hypothesis of overpopulation

50
00:02:37.836 --> 00:02:42.465
as a terrible danger to civil society.

51
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:49.569
"Education should aim at destroying free will.

52
00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.497
"So that after pupils have left school,

53
00:02:54.497 --> 00:02:59.497
"they shall be incapable throughout the rest of their lives

54
00:02:59.574 --> 00:03:03.755
"of thinking or acting otherwise

55
00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:08.107
"than as their schoolmasters should have wished.

56
00:03:08.107 --> 00:03:12.727
"Diet, injections, and injunctions,

57
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.300
"will combine from a very early age to produce

58
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.735
"the sort of character and the sort of beliefs

59
00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:25.746
"that the authorities consider desirable

60
00:03:25.746 --> 00:03:30.418
"and any serious criticism of the powers that be

61
00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:34.849
"will become psychologically impossible."

62
00:03:36.258 --> 00:03:40.784
Now, that's 80 years ago, but don't we see that

63
00:03:40.784 --> 00:03:45.179
happening today around us on many levels?

64
00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:48.443
<v Voiceover>Indeed, and in fact the type of circles</v>

65
00:03:48.443 --> 00:03:51.095
he ran with, in term circles of influence,

66
00:03:51.095 --> 00:03:54.956
are still very much, we're a generation or two out,

67
00:03:54.956 --> 00:03:57.431
they're still very much in power today.

68
00:03:57.431 --> 00:03:59.777
If you care to expand on that just a little bit,

69
00:03:59.777 --> 00:04:02.060
so we can see where some of this thinking

70
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.577
and directive has lead to now.

71
00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:05.727
<v ->Right.</v>

72
00:04:07.585 --> 00:04:08.400
<v Voiceover>So we can get a little bit</v>

73
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.531
of the lineage of it

74
00:04:09.531 --> 00:04:11.131
<v ->Okay, just a minute.</v>

75
00:04:14.331 --> 00:04:19.295
Now in the power elite, using diet,

76
00:04:19.295 --> 00:04:21.620
injections, and injunctions

77
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.225
to dole our intelligence and limit the population

78
00:04:25.225 --> 00:04:27.856
is exactly what's being carried out now.

79
00:04:27.856 --> 00:04:31.440
It's being implemented as the goals

80
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.912
of the New World Order.

81
00:04:32.912 --> 00:04:37.912
And of course, scientists and science are a key and crucial

82
00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:40.122
component of this.

83
00:04:40.122 --> 00:04:44.261
It would be impossible without scientists to do this.

84
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:48.783
Francis Crick, who worked with James Watson

85
00:04:48.783 --> 00:04:52.901
to crack the molecular code of DNA,

86
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:56.911
suggested medicating public drinking water

87
00:04:56.911 --> 00:04:59.855
to lower the fertility rate.

88
00:04:59.855 --> 00:05:02.500
This is decreasing birth rates.

89
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.215
It's part of the depopulation program.

90
00:05:07.215 --> 00:05:11.418
Dr. Gary Glum's book, called Full Disclosure,

91
00:05:11.418 --> 00:05:16.418
discussed Francis Crick's plan, and it's very shocking

92
00:05:16.623 --> 00:05:20.740
to hear the actual words of Francis Crick.

93
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.740
He said, "In 1962, the CIBA Foundation

94
00:05:26.762 --> 00:05:30.943
"held a symposium called Man and His Future."

95
00:05:30.943 --> 00:05:34.962
Now the CIBA Foundation is a pharmaceutical company.

96
00:05:34.962 --> 00:05:39.612
At which the keynote speaker was Francis Crick.

97
00:05:39.612 --> 00:05:44.612
His favorite tactics of population control included

98
00:05:45.096 --> 00:05:49.617
putting a chemical, which today we know is fluoride,

99
00:05:49.617 --> 00:05:53.799
that would cause sterility in the water supplies

100
00:05:53.799 --> 00:05:58.799
of those nations he judged as "not fit to have children."

101
00:06:02.467 --> 00:06:04.180
<v Voiceover>Was the U.S. among them,</v>

102
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.905
because we're fluoridated

103
00:06:05.905 --> 00:06:07.444
almost everywhere.
<v ->Of course.</v>

104
00:06:07.444 --> 00:06:08.959
<v ->Of course.</v>

105
00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:13.959
The Genome Project is just a new name for

106
00:06:14.591 --> 00:06:17.577
the Eugenics Program that got a bad name

107
00:06:17.577 --> 00:06:22.577
for killing off and sterilizing targeted elements

108
00:06:22.975 --> 00:06:24.916
of the population.

109
00:06:24.916 --> 00:06:28.137
They were gypsies, they were Jews, they were blacks,

110
00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:33.137
they were bloodlines that were identified as undesirable.

111
00:06:33.193 --> 00:06:35.369
But who made that decision?

112
00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:37.630
Of course, it was the ruling elite,

113
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.124
and who implemented it?

114
00:06:39.124 --> 00:06:41.492
Of course, it was the scientists.

115
00:06:41.492 --> 00:06:46.249
A quote, this is quoting Francis Crick,

116
00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:51.241
"This approach may run against Christian Ethics,

117
00:06:51.241 --> 00:06:54.740
"but I do not see why people should have a right

118
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.129
"to have children."

119
00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:00.819
"We might be able to achieve remarkable results

120
00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:05.628
"after 20 or 30 years by limitiing reproduction

121
00:07:05.628 --> 00:07:09.774
"to genetically superior couples."

122
00:07:11.494 --> 00:07:16.124
<v Voiceover>Okay, well, infertility is indeed an issue.</v>

123
00:07:16.124 --> 00:07:21.124
It's an issue and it seems mostly in first world nations

124
00:07:21.564 --> 00:07:24.124
where we have the greatest amount of science

125
00:07:24.124 --> 00:07:26.151
being applied to our societies.

126
00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:28.625
Now I know that there are other exceptions to that

127
00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:31.441
where experiments have been done on people and women

128
00:07:31.441 --> 00:07:36.441
in third world nations, the outcome has been sterility,

129
00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:40.273
and we're going to get into some of those,

130
00:07:40.273 --> 00:07:45.244
can we stick with this whole DNA issue for a moment

131
00:07:45.244 --> 00:07:47.697
and tracking, because there's something that

132
00:07:47.697 --> 00:07:49.830
you told me about when we interviewed you the first time

133
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.537
and I wanted to come back and revisit it.

134
00:07:51.537 --> 00:07:54.310
This has to do with an interesting project

135
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.529
by the wives of the Google guys,

136
00:07:56.529 --> 00:07:58.748
called 23andMe.

137
00:07:58.748 --> 00:08:01.878
Can we talk about this and why this is so

138
00:08:01.878 --> 00:08:06.878
significant a project that seemingly a humanitarian project

139
00:08:07.169 --> 00:08:10.092
that people support by paying for the service.

140
00:08:10.092 --> 00:08:15.092
<v ->Yes, Larry Page and Sergey Brin are the two co-founders</v>

141
00:08:16.257 --> 00:08:20.481
of Google, and they both dropped out of

142
00:08:20.481 --> 00:08:23.884
Stanford Graduate School to start Google

143
00:08:23.884 --> 00:08:27.276
and the owner of Sun Microsystems funded them.

144
00:08:27.276 --> 00:08:32.276
Now, Google, Sun Microsystems, and Microsoft

145
00:08:33.462 --> 00:08:37.004
are all moving their headquarters to Israel,

146
00:08:37.004 --> 00:08:39.350
which will put them under the control of

147
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:43.763
Jacob Rothschild and the city of London ruling elite.

148
00:08:43.763 --> 00:08:45.067
<v Voiceover>This is true?</v>

149
00:08:45.067 --> 00:08:46.836
They're all literally moving headquarters there?

150
00:08:46.836 --> 00:08:49.716
<v ->Yes they are, yes they are.</v>

151
00:08:49.716 --> 00:08:54.716
And Sergey Brin and Larry Page recently married,

152
00:08:55.927 --> 00:09:00.045
both of them in the year 2007.

153
00:09:02.165 --> 00:09:05.335
It's very curious that these 32 year olds

154
00:09:05.335 --> 00:09:09.367
with about 30 billion dollars each in their pockets

155
00:09:09.367 --> 00:09:14.367
both married women in

156
00:09:14.743 --> 00:09:19.743
biological information systems,

157
00:09:20.087 --> 00:09:25.087
in other words, genetics or eugenics.

158
00:09:26.828 --> 00:09:30.625
Anne Wojcicki worked at NIH,

159
00:09:30.625 --> 00:09:34.812
which is the eugenics headquarters for the U.S. government,

160
00:09:34.812 --> 00:09:38.247
then she went to the Weizmann Institute

161
00:09:38.247 --> 00:09:42.285
which is the eugenics headquarters for the City of London

162
00:09:42.285 --> 00:09:44.653
and the international bankers,

163
00:09:44.653 --> 00:09:48.023
then she worked at UC San Diego,

164
00:09:48.023 --> 00:09:53.023
which is the eugenics program for the Navy,

165
00:09:54.423 --> 00:09:56.962
or the University of California and the Navy

166
00:09:56.962 --> 00:10:01.292
work very closely because the University of California

167
00:10:01.292 --> 00:10:05.538
is actually a weapon of mass destruction.

168
00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:08.332
It's the main weapon of mass destruction contractor

169
00:10:08.332 --> 00:10:12.855
for the international bankers on Wall Street

170
00:10:12.855 --> 00:10:15.138
and the City of London.

171
00:10:15.138 --> 00:10:18.744
<v Voiceover>Under this umbrella are which facilities?</v>

172
00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:23.416
<v ->Under this umbrella was the Manhattan project</v>

173
00:10:23.416 --> 00:10:27.725
in World War Two, when they developed atomic bombs,

174
00:10:29.605 --> 00:10:33.912
an agent orange prototype intended for depopulation,

175
00:10:33.912 --> 00:10:38.912
and depleted uranium radioactive poison gas weapons.

176
00:10:40.909 --> 00:10:43.063
<v Voiceover>All of this under the UC California system?</v>

177
00:10:43.063 --> 00:10:46.370
<v ->All of this, well, the Manhattan Project started</v>

178
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.186
at UC Berkeley.

179
00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:54.285
The University of California has had

180
00:10:54.285 --> 00:10:58.380
the management contract unchallenged for 62 years

181
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.303
for the nuclear weapons laboratories.

182
00:11:01.303 --> 00:11:05.591
I began to investigate that and wondered why,

183
00:11:05.591 --> 00:11:08.143
and I discovered that

184
00:11:08.143 --> 00:11:11.237
the first president of the University of California

185
00:11:11.237 --> 00:11:15.461
was a Skull and Bones man from Yale,

186
00:11:15.461 --> 00:11:18.447
that's the ruling elite of the United States.

187
00:11:18.447 --> 00:11:20.733
His name was Gilman.

188
00:11:20.733 --> 00:11:25.107
and he was very interested in science.

189
00:11:25.107 --> 00:11:28.221
He recognized in the 1860s

190
00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:32.190
that science was essential to the ruling elite

191
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.642
maintaining control and power.

192
00:11:34.642 --> 00:11:36.669
<v Voiceover>Okay, so that's the history there.</v>

193
00:11:36.669 --> 00:11:38.227
Let's go back to Google.

194
00:11:40.257 --> 00:11:42.131
Not Google, but 23andMe.

195
00:11:42.131 --> 00:11:43.134
The wives of Google.

196
00:11:43.134 --> 00:11:47.250
<v ->Anne Wojcicki started</v>

197
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.664
a new company called 23andMe.

198
00:11:50.664 --> 00:11:53.949
Well there are 23 chromosomes on the DNA.

199
00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:57.170
As soon as she married Sergey Brin,

200
00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:00.882
She received millions of dollars, not only from Google,

201
00:12:00.882 --> 00:12:05.149
but other venture capital companies in Silicon Valley

202
00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:09.778
to move her startup company forward.

203
00:12:09.778 --> 00:12:14.778
And her company is to collect the DNA voluntarily

204
00:12:15.666 --> 00:12:18.802
from people through the internet

205
00:12:18.802 --> 00:12:23.239
and of course they'll pay her to analyze their DNA

206
00:12:23.239 --> 00:12:28.239
and give them suggestions on who would

207
00:12:28.295 --> 00:12:31.303
make better partners for them to marry,

208
00:12:31.303 --> 00:12:34.332
based on DNA considerations.

209
00:12:34.332 --> 00:12:39.332
Now it's alarming because you or I would never voluntarily

210
00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:44.892
give our DNA, that's very, very, very

211
00:12:44.892 --> 00:12:47.793
intimate information to anyone.

212
00:12:49.663 --> 00:12:53.156
They don't really need our DNA to know who we are,

213
00:12:53.156 --> 00:12:56.526
because if they can get a member from somewhere

214
00:12:56.526 --> 00:13:00.430
in your family, they have the DNA for the whole family.

215
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.569
<v Voiceover>What is the larger implication of this?</v>

216
00:13:04.569 --> 00:13:08.110
The largest implication of this, from what you understand?

217
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.182
Their group is relatively new, too.

218
00:13:11.182 --> 00:13:15.107
<v ->The largest implication is that Google,</v>

219
00:13:15.107 --> 00:13:18.947
when it's moved to Israel, will be directly under

220
00:13:18.947 --> 00:13:22.254
the control of the City of London bankers

221
00:13:22.254 --> 00:13:25.859
and Jacob Rothschild, or through Jacob Rothschild.

222
00:13:25.859 --> 00:13:30.859
That means that ethnic specific bio-weapons

223
00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:36.478
that are being developed in bio-weapons laboratories

224
00:13:36.478 --> 00:13:40.083
all over the U.S. and in other countries as well,

225
00:13:41.573 --> 00:13:45.885
will be used by the international bankers

226
00:13:45.885 --> 00:13:49.875
to wipe out bloodlines that they have identified

227
00:13:49.875 --> 00:13:52.627
as undesirable.

228
00:13:52.627 --> 00:13:57.627
It's not just gypsies and Mexicans and indigenous people,

229
00:13:58.664 --> 00:14:03.664
they also want to eliminate lateral thinkers

230
00:14:04.008 --> 00:14:08.636
and change agents in the population.

231
00:14:08.636 --> 00:14:12.902
They've already been culling and killing off

232
00:14:12.902 --> 00:14:17.084
about 50,000 people a year in England

233
00:14:17.084 --> 00:14:21.734
with microwave and other exotic technologies.

234
00:14:21.734 --> 00:14:26.734
This Doomsday machine is already underway.

235
00:14:26.811 --> 00:14:28.433
<v Voiceover>And there is a precedence for this.</v>

236
00:14:28.433 --> 00:14:30.950
Everyone's fairly well familiar with SARS,

237
00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.977
the whole Asian flu thing and how that

238
00:14:32.977 --> 00:14:35.003
played itself out in Canada.

239
00:14:37.853 --> 00:14:40.425
Give us some other ideas of where this is come up

240
00:14:40.425 --> 00:14:43.070
where there have been viruses that are

241
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.569
specifically engineered for a genotype.

242
00:14:50.729 --> 00:14:53.500
If there are others like SARS, or was that sort of--

243
00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.852
<v ->I'm trying to think of some examples.</v>

244
00:15:01.422 --> 00:15:06.422
Oh, well, it's not exactly a bio-weapon.

245
00:15:06.556 --> 00:15:11.484
We know that American scientists and medical experts

246
00:15:11.484 --> 00:15:14.791
visited American Indian reservations

247
00:15:14.791 --> 00:15:17.799
maybe about 20 years ago.

248
00:15:17.799 --> 00:15:22.279
They told the Indians they were collecting DNA data

249
00:15:22.279 --> 00:15:25.180
to help them with diabetes.

250
00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.633
They asked the Indians for permission

251
00:15:27.633 --> 00:15:29.681
to do mouth swabs on them.

252
00:15:29.681 --> 00:15:33.926
If you get a sample of someone's saliva

253
00:15:33.926 --> 00:15:36.384
and you could even get that off a fork they used

254
00:15:36.384 --> 00:15:39.776
in a restaurant, walk over and take it off the plate,

255
00:15:39.776 --> 00:15:43.253
then they have your DNA.

256
00:15:43.253 --> 00:15:47.541
In some American Indian tribes now,

257
00:15:47.541 --> 00:15:52.533
80% of the fertile women are sterile.

258
00:15:52.533 --> 00:15:54.751
<v Voiceover>How does that relate back to the previous</v>

259
00:15:54.751 --> 00:15:58.634
statement where their DNA samples were taken

260
00:15:58.634 --> 00:15:59.786
via their saliva?

261
00:15:59.786 --> 00:16:01.471
Then what was introduced or what happened

262
00:16:01.471 --> 00:16:03.327
to create the sterility?

263
00:16:03.327 --> 00:16:07.551
<v ->We know the American Indian populations are declining.</v>

264
00:16:07.551 --> 00:16:12.551
We know that the medical healers with traditional medicines

265
00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:16.618
in the Indian tribes are being murdered.

266
00:16:16.618 --> 00:16:21.546
I've been told that eight or 10 healers

267
00:16:21.546 --> 00:16:25.748
just in one Indian population,

268
00:16:25.748 --> 00:16:29.695
they all died within a week of each other.

269
00:16:29.695 --> 00:16:34.695
Also, in Hawaii, the Hawaiian high priesthood

270
00:16:34.772 --> 00:16:38.228
has informed me that their native healers

271
00:16:38.228 --> 00:16:41.577
are also dying off very quickly.

272
00:16:41.577 --> 00:16:46.577
Whether bio-weapons or other exotic types of technologies

273
00:16:46.868 --> 00:16:51.710
are being used on them is not completely straight-forward,

274
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:56.710
But they certainly have both technologies and the ability

275
00:16:56.792 --> 00:16:59.288
to use them and apply them anywhere they want to.

276
00:16:59.288 --> 00:17:00.824
<v Voiceover>What about vaccines?</v>

277
00:17:00.824 --> 00:17:03.362
<v ->Vaccines are the same thing.</v>

278
00:17:03.362 --> 00:17:08.205
I've interviewed a black South African woman who told me

279
00:17:08.205 --> 00:17:12.407
that she and the women in her family had many children.

280
00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:16.973
I'm sorry not her, but the women in her family

281
00:17:16.973 --> 00:17:19.469
had no problem having children

282
00:17:19.469 --> 00:17:22.541
and she said that when she and her friends

283
00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:25.762
went into the hospital in South Africa

284
00:17:25.762 --> 00:17:28.535
to have their first baby, these are black women,

285
00:17:30.155 --> 00:17:32.375
they were not allowed to leave the hospital

286
00:17:32.375 --> 00:17:36.172
until they had a shot and she said they wouldn't tell us

287
00:17:36.172 --> 00:17:39.991
what was in the shot, but we couldn't leave until we had it.

288
00:17:39.991 --> 00:17:44.962
She said none of us ever had a live birth again.

289
00:17:44.962 --> 00:17:49.962
They were given a vaccination or a chemical agent,

290
00:17:50.167 --> 00:17:53.857
a medical agent, that made them allergic

291
00:17:53.857 --> 00:17:56.865
to their own fertilized egg.

292
00:17:56.865 --> 00:17:59.511
None of them ever had another baby.

293
00:17:59.511 --> 00:18:00.812
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

294
00:18:00.812 --> 00:18:04.936
She also said that black babies born in these

295
00:18:04.936 --> 00:18:09.266
South African hospitals, neither parent had AIDS,

296
00:18:09.266 --> 00:18:14.237
but the newborn baby went home with AIDS.

297
00:18:14.237 --> 00:18:17.181
This Green Beret, special ops soldier

298
00:18:17.181 --> 00:18:20.359
was on a special mission to South Africa,

299
00:18:20.359 --> 00:18:24.967
and the U.S. military was transporting United Nations

300
00:18:24.967 --> 00:18:29.170
and World Health Organization doctors to South Africa

301
00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:32.360
to deal with an outbreak of

302
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.261
an epidemic of something like Anthrax.

303
00:18:35.261 --> 00:18:38.931
He told me when they got down there the area was quarantined

304
00:18:38.931 --> 00:18:41.598
It was also the center of the

305
00:18:41.598 --> 00:18:44.137
greatest resistance to apartheid.

306
00:18:44.137 --> 00:18:48.766
He looked around and he said there was no disease outbreak,

307
00:18:48.766 --> 00:18:51.283
it was very obvious.

308
00:18:51.283 --> 00:18:53.993
He began challenging the doctors

309
00:18:53.993 --> 00:18:57.022
and asking them why they were really down there.

310
00:18:57.022 --> 00:19:00.777
Finally, a doctor from Finland said, "No,

311
00:19:00.777 --> 00:19:05.117
"there's no outbreak here, but we're going to vaccinate

312
00:19:05.117 --> 00:19:10.117
"all these people and in 12 years they'll be dead."

313
00:19:10.813 --> 00:19:15.379
That was the introduction of AIDS.

314
00:19:15.379 --> 00:19:16.893
<v Voiceover>This was what year?</v>

315
00:19:16.893 --> 00:19:18.835
<v ->It was in the '70s.</v>

316
00:19:18.835 --> 00:19:23.835
The club of Rome proposed development of an AIDS-like

317
00:19:24.253 --> 00:19:29.253
agent for depopulation in about 1974.

318
00:19:30.674 --> 00:19:35.674
It was funded by Congress in a bill that gave the military

319
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.936
the funds to develop it at Fort Detrick.

320
00:19:40.936 --> 00:19:45.936
The AIDS vaccine, or the AIDS, it's put in vaccines,

321
00:19:46.333 --> 00:19:51.005
was manufactured in Phoenix Arizona in a laboratory

322
00:19:51.005 --> 00:19:54.738
and delivered to Africa.

323
00:19:54.738 --> 00:19:58.429
<v Voiceover>We can certainly see the history there</v>

324
00:19:58.429 --> 00:20:00.391
and the path of that.

325
00:20:00.391 --> 00:20:02.461
So that's Africa.

326
00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:03.847
<v ->That's Africa.</v>

327
00:20:03.847 --> 00:20:07.922
<v Voiceover>Attempts were made through various viruses</v>

328
00:20:07.922 --> 00:20:10.076
with the Asian population.

329
00:20:10.076 --> 00:20:11.207
<v ->That's right.</v>

330
00:20:11.207 --> 00:20:15.004
<v Voiceover>Now we have another interesting little</v>

331
00:20:15.004 --> 00:20:20.004
phenomenon called the HPV vaccine, Human Papillomavirus

332
00:20:20.785 --> 00:20:24.689
for young girls just coming into their ages of fertility.

333
00:20:24.689 --> 00:20:26.097
<v ->That's right.</v>

334
00:20:26.097 --> 00:20:28.955
<v Voiceover>Then beyond that, even boys,</v>

335
00:20:28.955 --> 00:20:30.833
which we're not going to get to just yet.

336
00:20:30.833 --> 00:20:32.945
What do you know about or can you share

337
00:20:32.945 --> 00:20:37.190
from your research about the HPV vaccine in young girls?

338
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:42.139
<v ->First of all, why would you give young girls a vaccine</v>

339
00:20:42.139 --> 00:20:44.934
when they were 10 to 12 years old,

340
00:20:44.934 --> 00:20:47.643
before they've even entered puberty?

341
00:20:47.643 --> 00:20:50.975
They're pre-puberty age.

342
00:20:50.975 --> 00:20:55.967
Why would you give it to girls who were

343
00:20:58.287 --> 00:21:01.087
not even sexually active.

344
00:21:01.087 --> 00:21:04.821
It would make much more sense to give it to them

345
00:21:04.821 --> 00:21:08.127
once they became sexually active.

346
00:21:08.127 --> 00:21:13.055
It's so widespread, I suspected right away that it was

347
00:21:13.055 --> 00:21:18.055
possibly an agent for sterilizing these women.

348
00:21:23.384 --> 00:21:26.648
It doesn't make sense.

349
00:21:26.648 --> 00:21:30.524
It also makes these young women sick sometimes.

350
00:21:30.524 --> 00:21:32.743
There's a reaction to it.

351
00:21:32.743 --> 00:21:36.092
It certainly hasn't been tested adequately.

352
00:21:36.092 --> 00:21:39.676
Why is there this big rush?

353
00:21:39.676 --> 00:21:41.959
I'd like to read something.

354
00:21:41.959 --> 00:21:45.052
I have to find it so wait just a minute.

355
00:21:52.761 --> 00:21:55.727
This is also from Bertrand Russell's book,

356
00:21:55.727 --> 00:21:58.542
The impact of Science on Society.

357
00:21:58.542 --> 00:22:01.636
This was published in 1952.

358
00:22:01.636 --> 00:22:05.198
He said, "The Nazi's were more scientific

359
00:22:05.198 --> 00:22:08.142
"than the present rulers of Russia.

360
00:22:08.142 --> 00:22:10.788
"If they had survived, they would probably

361
00:22:10.788 --> 00:22:14.223
"have soon taken to scientific breeding.

362
00:22:14.223 --> 00:22:17.465
"Any nation which adopts this practice will

363
00:22:17.465 --> 00:22:22.465
"within a generation, secure great military advantages.

364
00:22:24.398 --> 00:22:28.644
"The system, one may surmise, will be something like this,

365
00:22:28.644 --> 00:22:32.932
"except possibly in the governing aristocracy,

366
00:22:32.932 --> 00:22:37.932
"all but 5% of males and 30% of females will be sterilized.

367
00:22:39.844 --> 00:22:44.844
"The 30% of females will be expected to spend the years

368
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:50.468
"from 18 to 40 in reproduction in order

369
00:22:50.468 --> 00:22:55.091
"to secure adequate cannon fodder.

370
00:22:57.209 --> 00:23:02.209
"As a rule, artificial insemination will be preferred

371
00:23:02.265 --> 00:23:05.444
"to the natural method."

372
00:23:05.444 --> 00:23:08.879
That's Bertrand Russell's own words.

373
00:23:08.879 --> 00:23:13.879
Medical doctors and insiders today have told me

374
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:19.190
that wild reproduction is not a desirable

375
00:23:22.289 --> 00:23:24.898
outcome in the future.

376
00:23:24.898 --> 00:23:29.079
Already, we have terrible infertility problems

377
00:23:29.079 --> 00:23:30.914
in men and women.

378
00:23:30.914 --> 00:23:35.820
He also told me that in the near future,

379
00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.935
the only way people will be able to get pregnant

380
00:23:38.935 --> 00:23:41.836
is to go into a hospital.

381
00:23:41.836 --> 00:23:42.924
<v Voiceover>Why is that?</v>

382
00:23:42.924 --> 00:23:44.439
Because we'll be infertile?

383
00:23:44.439 --> 00:23:49.281
<v ->Infertile, and 20 years ago in the 1980s,</v>

384
00:23:49.281 --> 00:23:54.281
15% of men's sperm globally had damaged DNA,

385
00:23:58.473 --> 00:24:00.716
85% was normal.

386
00:24:00.716 --> 00:24:02.742
Today that is reversed.

387
00:24:02.742 --> 00:24:06.988
Only 20% of men's sperm today is normal

388
00:24:06.988 --> 00:24:10.316
and 80% has damaged DNA.

389
00:24:10.316 --> 00:24:15.316
It is so damaged now that at scientific conferences,

390
00:24:15.819 --> 00:24:20.279
where scientists come together from all over the world,

391
00:24:20.279 --> 00:24:25.271
they're ringing the alarm and they're making comments and

392
00:24:25.271 --> 00:24:30.271
statements publicly that everything is wrong with the sperm.

393
00:24:30.754 --> 00:24:35.754
It's very weak, it's not motile, it can't swim in the fluids

394
00:24:39.223 --> 00:24:43.575
to reach the egg, and of course the DNA is damaged.

395
00:24:43.575 --> 00:24:48.575
When you put the damaged DNA in an egg or a sperm together

396
00:24:49.356 --> 00:24:53.943
to form the first cell of a new living organism,

397
00:24:53.943 --> 00:24:58.943
every cell in that organism has the damaged DNA expressed

398
00:25:00.982 --> 00:25:05.910
in every cell, and it's passed on to all future generations

399
00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:08.854
and it never repairs itself.

400
00:25:08.854 --> 00:25:13.854
This is a scientific experiment by unconscionable people,

401
00:25:18.796 --> 00:25:21.569
which has an unknown outcome.

402
00:25:21.569 --> 00:25:26.341
It's damaging and changing the genome of the entire planet

403
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:31.126
which took four and a half billion years to evolve.

404
00:25:31.126 --> 00:25:34.859
You can't touch one part of it and damage it

405
00:25:34.859 --> 00:25:39.859
without damaging all of it, because it's interdependent,

406
00:25:40.342 --> 00:25:45.342
it's intradependent, and it's all organized

407
00:25:45.582 --> 00:25:48.462
in a syncopated dance.

408
00:25:48.462 --> 00:25:51.960
If one dancer trips and falls,

409
00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.437
it messes up the whole dance floor.

410
00:25:55.437 --> 00:25:58.509
<v Voiceover>We have dancers all over the world</v>

411
00:25:58.509 --> 00:25:59.917
tripping and falling right now.

412
00:25:59.917 --> 00:26:02.541
It seems as though it's coming from every direction

413
00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:05.379
and it all seems to be pointing to a weakened immune system

414
00:26:05.379 --> 00:26:09.261
and mass and also to a weakened ability to reproduce.

415
00:26:09.261 --> 00:26:14.261
If we continue the conversation about the HPV vaccine

416
00:26:14.552 --> 00:26:17.773
for the little girls, which is very highly debated

417
00:26:17.773 --> 00:26:20.056
because it may even cause cervical cancer,

418
00:26:20.056 --> 00:26:23.213
some studies say, no less infertility.

419
00:26:23.213 --> 00:26:28.213
How crazy is it that they're now recommending

420
00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:33.290
that young men and boys have this cervical vaccine?

421
00:26:33.709 --> 00:26:35.501
Now what's up with that?

422
00:26:35.501 --> 00:26:38.807
<v ->You see, as time goes on, the application</v>

423
00:26:38.807 --> 00:26:42.370
gets more and more bizarre and it actually confirms

424
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:46.701
earlier suspicions, not just by me, but many other people,

425
00:26:46.701 --> 00:26:51.701
that the hidden agenda is really to sterilize young people.

426
00:26:55.580 --> 00:27:00.322
The soldiers beginning in the summer of 2007

427
00:27:00.322 --> 00:27:04.759
who've served in Iraq and Afghanistan, the medical doctors,

428
00:27:04.759 --> 00:27:08.727
have been reporting very, very aggressive cancers

429
00:27:08.727 --> 00:27:11.373
in their mouths and in their throats.

430
00:27:11.373 --> 00:27:14.637
It's very difficult to even treat it.

431
00:27:14.637 --> 00:27:19.637
What is really bizarre is that the U.S. government is saying

432
00:27:20.738 --> 00:27:25.090
that these soldiers are having oral sex.

433
00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:26.604
<v Voiceover>And that's why they have the mouth cancers?</v>

434
00:27:26.604 --> 00:27:28.652
<v ->That's why they have these aggressive</v>

435
00:27:28.652 --> 00:27:30.914
mouth and throat cancers.

436
00:27:30.914 --> 00:27:35.052
Now they want to vaccinate the young men,

437
00:27:35.052 --> 00:27:36.908
all the young men, as well.

438
00:27:36.908 --> 00:27:41.495
I'm sure the young men and young women

439
00:27:41.495 --> 00:27:44.094
who are the real target of these vaccinations,

440
00:27:44.094 --> 00:27:49.094
I think it's going to be along ethnic lines.

441
00:27:56.236 --> 00:28:00.375
It's really very alarming, however,

442
00:28:00.375 --> 00:28:03.340
the aggressive throat and mouth cancers

443
00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:07.862
have also been reported since 1993

444
00:28:07.862 --> 00:28:12.214
in a very interesting animal in Tasmania

445
00:28:12.214 --> 00:28:14.774
called the Tasmanian devil.

446
00:28:14.774 --> 00:28:19.774
It's a small marsupial that looks like an opossum.

447
00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:25.065
It has been reported that 50% of the Tasmanian devil

448
00:28:26.145 --> 00:28:29.004
population has been exterminated

449
00:28:29.004 --> 00:28:34.004
with very aggressive throat and mouth cancers in Tasmania.

450
00:28:35.596 --> 00:28:37.046
<v Voiceover>Now, what do these have in common?</v>

451
00:28:37.046 --> 00:28:40.225
<v ->What they have in common is uranium.</v>

452
00:28:40.225 --> 00:28:44.726
The soldiers with these aggressive throat and mouth cancers,

453
00:28:44.726 --> 00:28:48.353
were contaminated and exposed to very high levels

454
00:28:48.353 --> 00:28:53.131
of depleted Uranium dust and nano particles

455
00:28:53.131 --> 00:28:58.131
in these war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq.

456
00:28:58.507 --> 00:29:01.686
Even down wind thousands of miles,

457
00:29:01.686 --> 00:29:03.222
this stuff goes all over the world.

458
00:29:03.222 --> 00:29:05.355
It's very mobile.

459
00:29:05.355 --> 00:29:10.155
In Tasmania, I looked up the air currents

460
00:29:10.155 --> 00:29:13.291
and the circulation patterns in that region

461
00:29:13.291 --> 00:29:15.126
of the Southern Hemisphere.

462
00:29:15.126 --> 00:29:20.126
I discovered that Uranium mining increased from 50%

463
00:29:20.398 --> 00:29:25.398
of the year, to 100% of the year in Australia in 1993,

464
00:29:27.737 --> 00:29:31.193
and milling of Uranium, which is a very dirty process

465
00:29:31.193 --> 00:29:33.134
where they crush the Uranium ore

466
00:29:33.134 --> 00:29:36.761
and the dust gets into the air, that also increased

467
00:29:36.761 --> 00:29:41.761
from 50% to 100% of the year in Australia.

468
00:29:41.838 --> 00:29:46.838
You're doubling two times, increasing by four,

469
00:29:47.129 --> 00:29:51.822
the amount of Uranium in the air, and the air currents

470
00:29:51.822 --> 00:29:56.387
carry it right down to Tasmania and New Zealand.

471
00:29:58.547 --> 00:30:01.806
These poor little Tasmanian devils,

472
00:30:01.806 --> 00:30:05.582
they die within two months.

473
00:30:05.582 --> 00:30:08.462
These cancers are very, very aggressive,

474
00:30:08.462 --> 00:30:11.790
and it's also on the muzzle of their faces,

475
00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:14.968
which is where they're scavenging for food

476
00:30:14.968 --> 00:30:16.632
and they're drinking water.

477
00:30:20.242 --> 00:30:25.242
It's the nano-particle effect, of very, very tiny particles

478
00:30:25.347 --> 00:30:29.906
of Uranium ore, and the Uranium weapons.

479
00:30:30.958 --> 00:30:32.494
<v Voiceover>This in and of itself is also</v>

480
00:30:32.494 --> 00:30:35.395
linked with infertility, isn't it, exposure?

481
00:30:35.395 --> 00:30:40.195
<v ->Oh my goodness, radiation causes tremendous</v>

482
00:30:40.195 --> 00:30:42.349
fertility problems.

483
00:30:42.349 --> 00:30:47.320
It not only damages the DNA in the egg and sperm,

484
00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:52.320
but it also causes infertility in men and in women.

485
00:30:54.016 --> 00:30:57.773
Very high increases infertility, that I just mentioned,

486
00:30:57.773 --> 00:31:01.223
are primarily due, it's a global event,

487
00:31:01.223 --> 00:31:04.024
so it has to be due to an environmental event.

488
00:31:04.024 --> 00:31:09.024
The only thing that's really been prolific since 1945

489
00:31:10.274 --> 00:31:15.274
in the global atmosphere is nuclear technology.

490
00:31:15.851 --> 00:31:19.968
It was atmospheric testing, the atomic bombs,

491
00:31:19.968 --> 00:31:22.165
and hydrogen bombs, had much more

492
00:31:22.165 --> 00:31:25.473
depleted Uranium in them than Plutonium.

493
00:31:25.473 --> 00:31:28.353
The Plutonium core was only 20 pounds.

494
00:31:28.353 --> 00:31:30.314
Thousands of pounds of depleted Uranium

495
00:31:30.314 --> 00:31:32.235
was packed around that core.

496
00:31:32.235 --> 00:31:35.584
That's all vaporized in a thermo-nuclear explosion.

497
00:31:35.584 --> 00:31:40.298
Then, when atmospheric testing ended in 1963,

498
00:31:42.624 --> 00:31:46.613
nuclear power plant emissions replaced that radiation

499
00:31:46.613 --> 00:31:51.306
that had been stopped, and then in 1991,

500
00:31:51.306 --> 00:31:54.015
depleted Uranium weapons were introduced to the

501
00:31:54.015 --> 00:31:59.015
battlefield, and the global impact is very obvious in data

502
00:32:00.714 --> 00:32:03.722
that I've collected from governments around the world.

503
00:32:03.722 --> 00:32:06.589
What is happening is

504
00:32:09.079 --> 00:32:13.108
this global pollution with the depleted Uranium combined

505
00:32:13.108 --> 00:32:15.199
with other nuclear technologies

506
00:32:15.199 --> 00:32:18.975
and the vaccines and everything else

507
00:32:18.975 --> 00:32:23.903
is increasing death rates, so their shaving off

508
00:32:23.903 --> 00:32:28.148
the lifetime expectancy of the elderly.

509
00:32:28.148 --> 00:32:32.137
It's cutback 15 years now in some countries,

510
00:32:32.137 --> 00:32:36.319
and they're decreasing birth rates by causing infertility.

511
00:32:36.319 --> 00:32:40.090
It's very obvious in the data I've collected

512
00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:42.501
all over the world, in Japan, in Hawaii,

513
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:47.501
in the United States, in European countries, and Russia,

514
00:32:47.557 --> 00:32:52.015
and Japan, and Germany now have a death rate

515
00:32:52.015 --> 00:32:55.556
that is higher than the birth rate.

516
00:32:55.556 --> 00:32:59.567
In other words, their populations are declining.

517
00:33:01.377 --> 00:33:03.514
<v Voiceover>Depleted uranium is being used in a very</v>

518
00:33:03.514 --> 00:33:07.247
targeted and literal way still to this day in Iraq,

519
00:33:07.247 --> 00:33:11.087
to basically sterilize the populations that these

520
00:33:11.087 --> 00:33:14.265
dirty bombs are being used against and in the process,

521
00:33:14.265 --> 00:33:18.558
also not just killing them, but creating, as you say,

522
00:33:18.558 --> 00:33:21.268
corrupted DNA, infertility, and so forth.

523
00:33:21.268 --> 00:33:23.550
But, our soldiers are bringing this back home.

524
00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:27.369
We talked about this earlier in the last interview.

525
00:33:27.369 --> 00:33:29.630
Certainly this is another mechanism.

526
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:32.340
There's something else that's on the horizon

527
00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:36.755
that could interfere again, with the health

528
00:33:36.755 --> 00:33:38.206
of the local populations.

529
00:33:38.206 --> 00:33:41.918
It's not ethnically biased nor targeted

530
00:33:41.918 --> 00:33:46.334
because this is something that's due to come out

531
00:33:46.334 --> 00:33:49.577
in September of '08 or August of '08,

532
00:33:49.577 --> 00:33:54.577
which is a spraying of a pesticide over the entire Bay Area,

533
00:33:55.336 --> 00:33:58.728
San Francisco Bay Area, which is just unbelievable

534
00:33:58.728 --> 00:34:03.728
in terms of the potential devastating effects

535
00:34:03.806 --> 00:34:06.174
and just simple side effects as well.

536
00:34:06.174 --> 00:34:09.395
This has already happened over the city of Santa Cruz.

537
00:34:09.395 --> 00:34:12.467
I'm concerned about a few things here.

538
00:34:12.467 --> 00:34:14.494
They're going to go ahead and run with this before

539
00:34:14.494 --> 00:34:18.867
there are any environmental impact reports done.

540
00:34:18.867 --> 00:34:19.976
<v ->That's right.</v>

541
00:34:19.976 --> 00:34:22.493
<v Voiceover>There is already evidence of what it's done</v>

542
00:34:22.493 --> 00:34:25.117
to the populations it's been sprayed over before.

543
00:34:25.117 --> 00:34:27.742
In addition it seems to be that if you just let

544
00:34:27.742 --> 00:34:29.736
this little critter, which someone got in here

545
00:34:29.736 --> 00:34:32.595
from Australia, be, it's not that devastating anyway.

546
00:34:32.595 --> 00:34:34.664
Tell us what's going on with the spraying

547
00:34:34.664 --> 00:34:36.264
for this little brown moth.

548
00:34:36.264 --> 00:34:39.251
<v ->Okay, can I just say something to add on to the end</v>

549
00:34:39.251 --> 00:34:40.184
of that last segment?

550
00:34:40.184 --> 00:34:41.525
<v Voiceover>Absolutely.</v>

551
00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:47.522
<v ->What I would like to just mention is that</v>

552
00:34:47.522 --> 00:34:52.301
these London Bankers who are carrying out this depopulation

553
00:34:52.301 --> 00:34:57.101
are also carrying it out on Israeli citizens.

554
00:34:57.101 --> 00:35:02.101
In the 2006 Israeli attack on Lebanon,

555
00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.389
which was planned years before,

556
00:35:05.389 --> 00:35:09.144
the U.S. had already transported 5,000

557
00:35:09.144 --> 00:35:12.258
depleted Uranium bunker busters to Israel

558
00:35:12.258 --> 00:35:15.607
two or three years before the attack.

559
00:35:15.607 --> 00:35:19.490
When the attack started, I knew they were using

560
00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:21.837
depleted Uranium bombs,

561
00:35:21.837 --> 00:35:23.629
and I knew they were grid bombing

562
00:35:23.629 --> 00:35:25.635
and carpet bombing Lebanon.

563
00:35:25.635 --> 00:35:28.984
I sent out a press release all over the world

564
00:35:28.984 --> 00:35:33.507
warning that as soon as the rain started in Israel,

565
00:35:33.507 --> 00:35:36.429
which was in October, within two months

566
00:35:36.429 --> 00:35:39.800
there would be an epidemic of diabetes in Isreal

567
00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:44.536
because that depleted uranium traveled on air currents

568
00:35:44.536 --> 00:35:48.717
in half an hour or less into Israel.

569
00:35:48.717 --> 00:35:53.197
The mountainous region of Israel is in the North,

570
00:35:53.197 --> 00:35:55.501
close to the border with Lebanon.

571
00:35:55.501 --> 00:36:00.501
Sure enough, in December, the first newspaper articles

572
00:36:01.645 --> 00:36:05.271
started to come out that there were huge increases

573
00:36:05.271 --> 00:36:09.026
in Northern Israel in childhood diabetes,

574
00:36:09.026 --> 00:36:13.527
and it was obviously synchronized with the rain patterns.

575
00:36:13.527 --> 00:36:16.748
And we know all over the world, from increases

576
00:36:16.748 --> 00:36:20.290
in diabetes, that the greatest number of new cases

577
00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:23.468
are always diagnosed when the rains start.

578
00:36:23.468 --> 00:36:26.967
It washes, the rain washes the radioactive particles

579
00:36:26.967 --> 00:36:30.700
out of the air, onto people's skin, into the drinking water,

580
00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:34.967
and on the food, and even worse,

581
00:36:34.967 --> 00:36:39.809
this is horrible, the bomb crater analyses

582
00:36:39.809 --> 00:36:44.673
from the Lebanon side of the border with Israel,

583
00:36:44.673 --> 00:36:48.129
that were used in the 2006 attack,

584
00:36:48.129 --> 00:36:51.329
were analyzed at Harwell, the British

585
00:36:51.329 --> 00:36:56.257
radiation laboratory, and it was found that these

586
00:36:56.257 --> 00:36:59.393
bomb craters were contaminated with deuterium,

587
00:36:59.393 --> 00:37:02.486
which is a component in nuclear weapons,

588
00:37:02.486 --> 00:37:06.668
and high levels of uranium-235, which is removed

589
00:37:06.668 --> 00:37:09.633
from depleted uranium, it should have been much lower,

590
00:37:09.633 --> 00:37:13.644
and also there were very high levels of radiation

591
00:37:13.644 --> 00:37:17.740
when monitoring was done for a couple of months

592
00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:21.302
for the first three weeks, very high levels of radiation

593
00:37:21.302 --> 00:37:25.910
dropped very quickly, and these are all the signatures

594
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.555
of fourth generation nuclear weapons.

595
00:37:28.555 --> 00:37:31.670
These were fusion weapons, or a new kind

596
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:34.443
of fission weapon, we don't really know.

597
00:37:34.443 --> 00:37:39.222
Probably fusion weapons, and this also contributed

598
00:37:39.222 --> 00:37:43.488
to the illness imposed on the Israeli people.

599
00:37:43.488 --> 00:37:48.488
Now, I'm saying this because religion really

600
00:37:49.061 --> 00:37:51.216
has nothing to do with this.

601
00:37:51.216 --> 00:37:52.453
<v Voiceover>Right, the powers that be</v>

602
00:37:52.453 --> 00:37:54.736
are equal opportunity offenders in that sense.

603
00:37:54.736 --> 00:37:56.805
<v ->Equal opportunity killers.</v>

604
00:37:56.805 --> 00:37:58.064
<v Voiceover>Exactly.</v>

605
00:37:58.064 --> 00:38:01.861
<v ->And perhaps they're depopulating Israel now,</v>

606
00:38:01.861 --> 00:38:06.853
to bring in the big corporations, and to make this

607
00:38:06.853 --> 00:38:10.245
one of the new centers for world government.

608
00:38:10.245 --> 00:38:12.656
That's what I suspect is happening.

609
00:38:12.656 --> 00:38:16.645
And radiation respects no borders.

610
00:38:16.645 --> 00:38:20.506
It respects no socio-economic class,

611
00:38:20.506 --> 00:38:23.557
and it respects no religion.

612
00:38:23.557 --> 00:38:25.029
<v Voiceover>Yes.</v>

613
00:38:25.029 --> 00:38:26.949
<v ->So let's go back to the brown moth.</v>

614
00:38:26.949 --> 00:38:29.851
<v Voiceover>Let's go back to the brown moth, okay.</v>

615
00:38:29.851 --> 00:38:34.851
<v ->Yes, the secretary for food and agriculture,</v>

616
00:38:35.248 --> 00:38:40.248
Mr. Kawata, appeared at the Berkeley City Council

617
00:38:40.806 --> 00:38:45.806
meeting on February 21st, and he brought a panel

618
00:38:46.864 --> 00:38:49.808
of three other people with him, a medical doctor,

619
00:38:49.808 --> 00:38:53.670
a pesticide expert, and a toxicologist.

620
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:58.670
And in that discussion that they had, a presentation

621
00:38:59.024 --> 00:39:02.907
in questions, feedback from the city council members,

622
00:39:02.907 --> 00:39:07.907
Mr. Kawata announced that this brown moth

623
00:39:08.517 --> 00:39:12.571
had been in California for at least 10 years.

624
00:39:12.571 --> 00:39:16.880
It had never been proven to be harmful to agriculture,

625
00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:21.880
the pesticide had had no effect in the two year spraying

626
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.989
program to eradicate the brown apple moth

627
00:39:25.989 --> 00:39:30.983
in the Santa Cruz area, and there have been no studies done

628
00:39:30.983 --> 00:39:34.652
on the health effects of this pesticide.

629
00:39:34.652 --> 00:39:39.260
He also stated that they would begin spraying for at least

630
00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:44.260
five years in the entire bay area in August of 2008.

631
00:39:45.339 --> 00:39:48.837
And that the environmental impact statement

632
00:39:48.837 --> 00:39:53.786
would not be finished until the Fall of 2008.

633
00:39:53.786 --> 00:39:57.946
And when city council members and public citizens

634
00:39:57.946 --> 00:40:01.316
making comment brought up many issues.

635
00:40:01.316 --> 00:40:06.031
They said that over 600 people had been made ill

636
00:40:06.031 --> 00:40:09.850
by the spraying over a two year period in Santa Cruz.

637
00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:14.850
The absenteeism in schools went up 100%

638
00:40:15.162 --> 00:40:18.703
the day after the spraying, because it made school children

639
00:40:18.703 --> 00:40:23.609
ill, some people had to move out of Santa Cruz,

640
00:40:23.609 --> 00:40:28.025
they were too ill to stay there during this spraying program

641
00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:32.649
and Mr. Kawata said, "Well."

642
00:40:35.343 --> 00:40:39.439
He said, "Well, they were, oh that was just

643
00:40:39.439 --> 00:40:42.489
"information from the internet, and they were mentally ill,

644
00:40:42.489 --> 00:40:46.969
"or they had some kind of stress syndrome or other issues,

645
00:40:46.969 --> 00:40:51.534
"but it wasn't the pesticide they just had mental problems."

646
00:40:51.534 --> 00:40:53.540
And one of the city council members said,

647
00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:57.572
"Well hundreds of thousands of cats died from this spray

648
00:40:57.572 --> 00:41:00.174
"during the spraying of Santa Cruz,

649
00:41:00.174 --> 00:41:03.097
"were they mentally ill too?"

650
00:41:03.097 --> 00:41:05.891
<v Voiceover>Okay that's a good one.</v>

651
00:41:05.891 --> 00:41:07.235
(laughter)

652
00:41:07.235 --> 00:41:12.206
<v ->So, it was quite obvious, not only from his testimony</v>

653
00:41:12.206 --> 00:41:16.184
in that city council meeting, but from visits he'd made

654
00:41:16.184 --> 00:41:19.128
to other cities in the bay area and feedback

655
00:41:19.128 --> 00:41:24.128
and from the cities, and thousands of worried citizens

656
00:41:24.568 --> 00:41:29.568
that the only five people who are in favor of this pesticide

657
00:41:31.245 --> 00:41:35.789
spraying program are Mr. Kawata, the secretary for food

658
00:41:35.789 --> 00:41:40.333
and agriculture, and the three panelists he brought with him

659
00:41:40.333 --> 00:41:44.237
as well as Governor Schwarzenegger.

660
00:41:44.237 --> 00:41:46.626
Now we know Governor Schwarzenegger

661
00:41:46.626 --> 00:41:51.626
was made governor by Jacob Rothschild at the City of London,

662
00:41:51.789 --> 00:41:56.789
and the economy of the state of California

663
00:41:56.994 --> 00:42:01.410
is the seventh largest economy in the world,

664
00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:04.141
and California has no debt.

665
00:42:04.141 --> 00:42:09.141
The City of London bankers are absolutely drooling

666
00:42:09.196 --> 00:42:12.844
and slobbering over the tremendous wealth

667
00:42:12.844 --> 00:42:17.844
that California has, and so he's put in a governor

668
00:42:18.412 --> 00:42:22.466
who will implement programs that are favorable

669
00:42:22.466 --> 00:42:27.394
or desired by the City of London bankers.

670
00:42:27.394 --> 00:42:29.335
<v Voiceover>Now why was this spraying program,</v>

671
00:42:29.335 --> 00:42:31.681
would you see it to be favorable to them?

672
00:42:31.681 --> 00:42:35.884
<v ->Well number one, the San Francisco Bay area,</v>

673
00:42:35.884 --> 00:42:39.489
remember the Apartheid issue in South Africa?

674
00:42:39.489 --> 00:42:43.223
And the introduction of AIDS, the San Francisco Bay area

675
00:42:43.223 --> 00:42:47.703
is the most activist center in the United States.

676
00:42:47.703 --> 00:42:50.817
There are over 1000 activist organizations here.

677
00:42:50.817 --> 00:42:55.468
It's also the most progressive, it is the most liberal,

678
00:42:55.468 --> 00:43:00.468
and it is the strongest anti-war

679
00:43:00.801 --> 00:43:03.276
center in the United States.

680
00:43:03.276 --> 00:43:04.876
<v Voiceover>This is true, extremely liberal</v>

681
00:43:04.876 --> 00:43:07.542
slash progressive communities around the bay area.

682
00:43:07.542 --> 00:43:11.230
<v ->And what is the name of this pesticide?</v>

683
00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:13.832
<v Voiceover>Oh yes, Checkmate.</v>

684
00:43:13.832 --> 00:43:16.456
<v ->It's called Checkmate.</v>

685
00:43:16.456 --> 00:43:17.459
<v Voiceover>Checkmate.</v>

686
00:43:17.459 --> 00:43:22.459
<v ->Or Checkpoint, yes so doesn't that kind of hint</v>

687
00:43:23.027 --> 00:43:24.627
at the hidden agenda.

688
00:43:24.627 --> 00:43:26.355
<v Voiceover>Yeah, that's cryptic.</v>

689
00:43:26.355 --> 00:43:27.571
<v ->Very cryptic.</v>

690
00:43:27.571 --> 00:43:29.619
<v Voiceover>What about DNA, was there any science about</v>

691
00:43:29.619 --> 00:43:32.861
the effects on DNA, or anything deeper?

692
00:43:32.861 --> 00:43:36.744
<v ->There haven't been any studies on the effects</v>

693
00:43:36.744 --> 00:43:41.203
to the people in Santa Cruz, but a pediatrician

694
00:43:41.203 --> 00:43:44.274
who testified in the Berkeley City Council meeting,

695
00:43:44.274 --> 00:43:49.274
stated that baby boys who were exposed in utero

696
00:43:50.163 --> 00:43:54.002
to chemicals in the pheromones that make up

697
00:43:54.002 --> 00:43:58.248
the pesticide have been born, reported to have been born

698
00:43:58.248 --> 00:44:02.472
with micro-penises, in other words very small,

699
00:44:02.472 --> 00:44:06.375
undersized penises, or deformed penises.

700
00:44:06.375 --> 00:44:10.386
And since this is a pheromone, which is a hormone.

701
00:44:10.386 --> 00:44:15.386
It's a signaling molecule, it's intended to make the male

702
00:44:16.338 --> 00:44:20.861
moths unable to mate with the female moths.

703
00:44:20.861 --> 00:44:24.829
It can have the same effect potentially on human beings.

704
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:27.452
These are signaling molecules,

705
00:44:27.452 --> 00:44:31.420
and we know from pesticides and radiation

706
00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:36.284
in that have contaminated the Columbia River

707
00:44:36.284 --> 00:44:41.284
in Washington State, that the population of fish,

708
00:44:42.151 --> 00:44:47.151
the females are increasing, and the males are decreasing.

709
00:44:47.249 --> 00:44:51.389
Also, the otters, the freshwater otters that live

710
00:44:51.389 --> 00:44:55.420
in that river, the males are no longer able

711
00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:58.407
to mate with the females, they don't know what to do.

712
00:44:58.407 --> 00:45:03.407
We also know that in contaminated areas from pesticides

713
00:45:03.612 --> 00:45:08.442
and agricultural chemicals, in the Everglades in Florida,

714
00:45:08.442 --> 00:45:11.728
that the alligators do not know how to mate,

715
00:45:11.728 --> 00:45:14.586
the males with the females also.

716
00:45:14.586 --> 00:45:19.586
So, these are signaling molecules that control

717
00:45:19.731 --> 00:45:24.192
the sexual responses

718
00:45:24.192 --> 00:45:28.331
and natural things that animals do.

719
00:45:28.331 --> 00:45:33.331
In many animals, in fish, and obviously in humans as well.

720
00:45:34.112 --> 00:45:39.112
<v Voiceover>So kind of bringing this back full circle,</v>

721
00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:45.170
our DNA seems to be being impacted by a number

722
00:45:45.461 --> 00:45:48.810
of influences, we've talked about the radiation.

723
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:51.925
We've talked about the potential of some of these pesticides

724
00:45:51.925 --> 00:45:56.085
just a moment ago, we have now a system

725
00:45:56.085 --> 00:46:00.650
in which our DNA can be gathered voluntarily.

726
00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:04.319
The information so that very specific agents

727
00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:06.916
can be made, that target and create viruses for

728
00:46:06.916 --> 00:46:10.372
that particular gene pool, if that is the desire of those

729
00:46:10.372 --> 00:46:12.719
that can do this in conjunction with the scientific

730
00:46:12.719 --> 00:46:17.326
community, we also have chem trails in the air.

731
00:46:17.326 --> 00:46:21.401
<v ->That's right and this is another aspect of the pesticide</v>

732
00:46:21.401 --> 00:46:25.988
program because chem trails were conducted,

733
00:46:25.988 --> 00:46:30.894
they were spread over the Santa Cruz area the entire time

734
00:46:30.894 --> 00:46:34.158
that the pesticide program was going on.

735
00:46:34.158 --> 00:46:38.233
Now why would they be spraying metal particulates

736
00:46:38.233 --> 00:46:42.926
with plastics or other components in the chem trails

737
00:46:42.926 --> 00:46:46.547
over Santa Cruz at the same time they were doing

738
00:46:46.547 --> 00:46:48.851
the pesticide spraying?

739
00:46:48.851 --> 00:46:53.368
And the answer is that when I was an environmental

740
00:46:53.368 --> 00:46:57.635
commissioner for the city of Berkeley for eight years,

741
00:46:57.635 --> 00:47:00.707
the University of California, and the Lawrence Berkeley Lab

742
00:47:00.707 --> 00:47:04.184
had to come to the commission each time they wanted

743
00:47:04.184 --> 00:47:09.005
to do a new project, and when they came to tell us

744
00:47:09.005 --> 00:47:14.005
about a nanotechnology foundry, a nanotechnology facility

745
00:47:14.552 --> 00:47:17.218
that they wanted to build at the Lawrence Berkeley Lab

746
00:47:17.218 --> 00:47:20.568
up above the Berkeley campus, I asked them,

747
00:47:20.568 --> 00:47:25.568
"Will these, this nanotechnology research be used

748
00:47:25.815 --> 00:47:28.717
"for nuclear weapons development?"

749
00:47:28.717 --> 00:47:32.066
And I had to ask that because Berkeley is a nuclear weapons

750
00:47:32.066 --> 00:47:35.266
free zone, and they assured me, oh no,

751
00:47:35.266 --> 00:47:39.469
that's not what it's for, and then somehow the conversation

752
00:47:39.469 --> 00:47:43.479
turned to binary weapons.

753
00:47:43.479 --> 00:47:46.018
And I said, "What's a binary weapon?"

754
00:47:46.018 --> 00:47:48.748
And they said, "It's a biological weapon

755
00:47:48.748 --> 00:47:51.863
"that has two components, or even three.

756
00:47:51.863 --> 00:47:56.834
"And when one is introduced, it may not cause any harm,

757
00:47:56.834 --> 00:48:00.012
"or it may be minimal, but when the second component

758
00:48:00.012 --> 00:48:03.588
"is introduced, they interact synergistically,

759
00:48:03.588 --> 00:48:07.108
"and become very toxic or lethal."

760
00:48:07.108 --> 00:48:11.652
And I just went to a pesticide conference in the

761
00:48:11.652 --> 00:48:15.385
city of Berkeley, which is held annually,

762
00:48:15.385 --> 00:48:18.841
and it was very interesting because one of the speakers said

763
00:48:18.841 --> 00:48:23.841
that sunlight can interact with pesticides,

764
00:48:24.482 --> 00:48:29.482
or other components, and increase the lethality,

765
00:48:29.772 --> 00:48:34.772
or trigger the chemical action of these agents.

766
00:48:37.111 --> 00:48:39.777
Another thing with this pesticide is that it's in

767
00:48:39.777 --> 00:48:43.745
very tiny capsules, in maybe the 10 micron range.

768
00:48:43.745 --> 00:48:46.359
This is larger than nano-particles,

769
00:48:46.359 --> 00:48:50.134
but these tiny plastic capsules

770
00:48:50.134 --> 00:48:55.134
after the pesticide escapes and is disbursed in the air,

771
00:48:55.489 --> 00:49:00.489
these have formed a horrible scum and messed up

772
00:49:00.908 --> 00:49:04.406
all of the waterways, the creeks, the rivers,

773
00:49:04.406 --> 00:49:09.121
and even the coastline of beautiful Santa Cruz.

774
00:49:09.121 --> 00:49:12.513
So, that's only two years of spraying.

775
00:49:12.513 --> 00:49:14.134
<v Voiceover>And they want to spray for five years.</v>

776
00:49:14.134 --> 00:49:16.651
<v ->Oh they want to, at least five years.</v>

777
00:49:16.651 --> 00:49:18.337
<v Voiceover>So just the fact that it doesn't seem</v>

778
00:49:18.337 --> 00:49:20.897
to have any impact on the brown apple moth

779
00:49:20.897 --> 00:49:24.246
is a big red flag, the fact that they don't want

780
00:49:24.246 --> 00:49:26.166
to get the environmental impact reports in

781
00:49:26.166 --> 00:49:29.707
before they start the project is a really large red flag.

782
00:49:29.707 --> 00:49:32.971
Well, my understanding, and this is happening very soon,

783
00:49:32.971 --> 00:49:35.382
in fact next week, from the time they're shooting this.

784
00:49:35.382 --> 00:49:37.131
From the time this airs, it will have been done,

785
00:49:37.131 --> 00:49:40.203
the Berkeley City Council is going to put their protest vote

786
00:49:40.203 --> 00:49:43.447
together, hopefully an attorney, or a team of attorneys

787
00:49:43.447 --> 00:49:46.518
will be assembled to fight the government on this,

788
00:49:46.518 --> 00:49:48.630
this spraying program, because it seems

789
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:51.296
that all the communities around here are outraged over this.

790
00:49:51.296 --> 00:49:53.728
<v ->All of the communities are outraged.</v>

791
00:49:53.728 --> 00:49:56.864
As I said, the only five people who are in favor of this

792
00:49:56.864 --> 00:50:01.664
plan are in Sacramento, and they're not going to be sprayed.

793
00:50:01.664 --> 00:50:05.696
Oh, and then one of the city council members

794
00:50:05.696 --> 00:50:09.387
asked one of the members of this panel, the medical doctor,

795
00:50:09.387 --> 00:50:12.544
"Would you like your children to be sprayed

796
00:50:12.544 --> 00:50:14.293
"with this pesticide?"

797
00:50:14.293 --> 00:50:16.555
And he could not give a straight answer.

798
00:50:16.555 --> 00:50:19.541
He wouldn't really properly answer the question.

799
00:50:19.541 --> 00:50:24.541
So, you know that sort of gives the game away.

800
00:50:24.597 --> 00:50:26.026
<v Voiceover>Well there's another flag.</v>

801
00:50:26.026 --> 00:50:29.973
<v ->Yeah, there's another flag, but another flag</v>

802
00:50:29.973 --> 00:50:32.768
is, let me think of what I was gonna say.

803
00:50:32.768 --> 00:50:37.163
Oh, another very strong flag, is that

804
00:50:37.163 --> 00:50:39.873
the secretary for food and agriculture said,

805
00:50:39.873 --> 00:50:43.200
"Our consultants on this spraying program

806
00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:47.461
"are from Tasmania, New Zealand, and Australia."

807
00:50:48.598 --> 00:50:51.350
And they're not spraying down there,

808
00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:54.699
because the moth isn't a pest.

809
00:50:54.699 --> 00:50:58.569
An agricultural pest, and so I was wondering,

810
00:50:58.569 --> 00:51:01.471
well how could they be experts on a spraying program,

811
00:51:01.471 --> 00:51:03.793
if they don't even spray down there.

812
00:51:03.793 --> 00:51:04.966
<v Voiceover>Interesting.</v>

813
00:51:04.966 --> 00:51:07.441
<v ->And it's actually indigenous to Tasmania,</v>

814
00:51:07.441 --> 00:51:10.086
and in New Zealand and Australia,

815
00:51:10.086 --> 00:51:13.008
there are natural predators that keep it in check.

816
00:51:13.008 --> 00:51:14.075
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

817
00:51:14.075 --> 00:51:18.491
<v ->So what they're doing is attacking our immune systems</v>

818
00:51:18.491 --> 00:51:23.491
globally with depleted uranium, global contamination,

819
00:51:23.974 --> 00:51:26.512
they're attacking our fertility,

820
00:51:26.512 --> 00:51:31.227
they're increasing death rates, and decreasing birth rates,

821
00:51:31.227 --> 00:51:36.227
and then locally, they're using vaccines to sterilize,

822
00:51:36.496 --> 00:51:41.496
they're using pesticides and other chemical agents

823
00:51:42.469 --> 00:51:45.179
in combination with other components,

824
00:51:45.179 --> 00:51:50.179
to interact in an unknown way, and I think that most people,

825
00:51:50.469 --> 00:51:54.925
citizens who testified in the city council meeting,

826
00:51:54.925 --> 00:51:58.125
and they've written in newspapers and so forth,

827
00:51:58.125 --> 00:52:03.125
are calling this a bio-warfare attack on the bay area.

828
00:52:03.309 --> 00:52:05.805
I think people clearly understand

829
00:52:05.805 --> 00:52:08.151
that's exactly what this is.

830
00:52:08.151 --> 00:52:12.653
<v Voiceover>In Sedona, Arizona, the chem trail,</v>

831
00:52:12.653 --> 00:52:16.940
the instance of chem trails have been extremely high

832
00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:20.055
over the last, more than half a dozen years.

833
00:52:20.055 --> 00:52:22.404
And certainly one of the effects that it's had

834
00:52:22.404 --> 00:52:25.326
is people are exhausted, upper-respiratory infections,

835
00:52:25.326 --> 00:52:28.718
constant threats to move out of the region.

836
00:52:28.718 --> 00:52:33.718
I've noticed that this is now pretty standard in most cities

837
00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:36.868
in most cities we're seeing it, including in Europe,

838
00:52:36.868 --> 00:52:40.025
and certainly in the United Kingdom and here too,

839
00:52:40.025 --> 00:52:43.779
and this appears to be, so it must be a component of

840
00:52:43.779 --> 00:52:46.105
all of this, it has to be a component.

841
00:52:46.105 --> 00:52:49.667
And if you take, we did an interview,

842
00:52:49.667 --> 00:52:52.867
just as an aside, with Stephen Lewis,

843
00:52:52.867 --> 00:52:57.027
the founder of the AIM program, working on a quantum level,

844
00:52:57.027 --> 00:53:00.312
fixing vibrational causes for disease.

845
00:53:00.312 --> 00:53:03.235
And he said that almost without exception now,

846
00:53:03.235 --> 00:53:06.670
every single new virus that is popping up,

847
00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:10.467
is man-made, and so it seems to me to be

848
00:53:10.467 --> 00:53:15.467
very clear, we are under assault on so many levels.

849
00:53:15.587 --> 00:53:18.936
To weaken the human immune system,

850
00:53:18.936 --> 00:53:22.157
that it really seems to me, just taking care of our

851
00:53:22.157 --> 00:53:25.400
immune system has to be number one on the list now,

852
00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.915
of our priorities.

853
00:53:26.915 --> 00:53:31.267
<v ->Well, what's interesting is, that following World War Two,</v>

854
00:53:31.267 --> 00:53:35.128
in the debriefing of the Nazis, the officers

855
00:53:35.128 --> 00:53:38.264
who carried out their military programs,

856
00:53:38.264 --> 00:53:40.846
one of them said in the interview,

857
00:53:40.846 --> 00:53:43.469
well you know, big bombs and armies,

858
00:53:43.469 --> 00:53:46.755
and militaries are so messy, and they're very expensive

859
00:53:46.755 --> 00:53:50.445
when just some germs in a small vile

860
00:53:50.445 --> 00:53:52.920
would do the same job.

861
00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:57.336
It's a lot cheaper.

862
00:53:57.336 --> 00:53:59.000
<v Voiceover>It's a lot cheaper and--</v>

863
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.200
<v ->And they can make a lot of money on the pharmaceuticals</v>

864
00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:04.760
so the same people who are making the decisions

865
00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:07.277
to develop these weapons and go to war,

866
00:54:07.277 --> 00:54:10.029
own the pharmaceutical companies so they're making

867
00:54:10.029 --> 00:54:12.781
huge profits, and in third world countries,

868
00:54:12.781 --> 00:54:16.315
people who can't afford healthcare simply die.

869
00:54:16.315 --> 00:54:18.606
So it's all de-population.

870
00:54:18.606 --> 00:54:20.526
(soft rock music)

871
00:54:20.526 --> 00:54:21.699
<v Voiceover>Thank you Leuren.</v>

872
00:54:21.699 --> 00:54:23.619
