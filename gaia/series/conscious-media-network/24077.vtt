00:00:00.921 --> 00:00:03.414
<v ->Dr Manjir Samanta-Laughton was sitting in a tree</v>

2
00:00:03.414 --> 00:00:06.028
contemplating some of life's deeper questions

3
00:00:06.028 --> 00:00:08.875
when an entire tree of knowledge was shown to her.

4
00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.254
The result shows itself in her incredible book,

5
00:00:11.254 --> 00:00:12.747
Punk Science.

6
00:00:12.747 --> 00:00:14.709
In Punk Science, she explains the science

7
00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.544
that validates all of the mysteries,

8
00:00:16.544 --> 00:00:19.861
up through hyperspace, angels, intuition and beyond.

9
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:22.260
In this journey back to our higher knowing,

10
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.247
she says the biggest obstacle

11
00:00:24.247 --> 00:00:26.541
is unhealed human emotions.

00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:30.492 line:15% 
(Eastern instrumental music)

13
00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:41.132
This is not just a trip, it's a dance, it's beyond that.

14
00:00:41.132 --> 00:00:43.468
Even you, in your book, Punk Science,

15
00:00:43.468 --> 00:00:45.046
you take us all the way from

16
00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:48.218
atoms through angels to black hole principle,

17
00:00:48.218 --> 00:00:50.501
the black hole principle, as you call it.

18
00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:53.007
And everything in there is so beautifully woven

19
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:54.927
in terms of connecting the dots.

20
00:00:54.927 --> 00:00:57.285
The people you draw upon, a lot of our viewers

21
00:00:57.285 --> 00:00:58.522
are familiar with.

22
00:00:58.522 --> 00:01:01.146
And you take each of their parts and put them together

23
00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:02.820
in an extraordinary way,

24
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.583
and can we just start out in a really simple,

25
00:01:05.583 --> 00:01:07.705
rather pedestrian area, which is,

26
00:01:07.705 --> 00:01:10.425
what is it about science today that is really

27
00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:12.718
falling down to the point where people are looking

28
00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:15.129
other places for their information?

29
00:01:15.129 --> 00:01:17.209
<v ->Well, that's a really interesting question,</v>

30
00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:20.227
'cause a lot of people are talking about,

31
00:01:20.227 --> 00:01:21.667
"Science has lost its way,

32
00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:25.411
"there's no more exciting developments to be found."

33
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:28.813
And people are even talking about the end of science,

34
00:01:28.813 --> 00:01:31.671
like there's nothing major,

35
00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:34.669
all the great theories like relativity,

36
00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:37.367
they're all in the past and there's nothing more

37
00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:38.509
to be found.

38
00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.066
But, when you look around you,

39
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:43.372
there are plenty of people that are having experiences.

40
00:01:43.372 --> 00:01:45.014
Psychic experiences,

41
00:01:45.014 --> 00:01:47.191
they're having multi-dimensional experiences.

42
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:49.708
And how can you say that there's nothing

43
00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:52.172
to be discovered when these people are having

44
00:01:52.172 --> 00:01:53.889
these experiences every day

45
00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:56.533
and, in fact, I had a discussion with Professor

46
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:59.115
Richard Dawkins about this, where he was saying,

47
00:01:59.115 --> 00:02:00.555
"But that's not science!"

48
00:02:00.555 --> 00:02:03.158
And it's like, well people are part of our universe.

49
00:02:03.158 --> 00:02:06.859
People are actually part of our cosmos,

50
00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:09.195
we need to understand what they're going through.

51
00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:12.810
So the trouble is, the science that we've had for so long,

52
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.552
the sort of mechanistic, reductionist, often called

53
00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:17.759
the Newtonian science,

54
00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:20.853
doesn't explain a lot that people are feeling nowadays.

55
00:02:20.853 --> 00:02:24.478
And what we need to do is move into this new era

56
00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:27.615
where consciousness becomes part of science.

57
00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:30.793
For many, many years we've just ignored consciousness

58
00:02:30.793 --> 00:02:33.449
as part of our universe,

59
00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:36.073
and once you start to understand that consciousness

60
00:02:36.073 --> 00:02:38.793
is actually the very fabric of our universe,

61
00:02:38.793 --> 00:02:40.937
we can start to move into a new era.

62
00:02:40.937 --> 00:02:43.837
<v Host>Absolutely, I mean the intelligence, and,</v>

63
00:02:43.837 --> 00:02:46.174
this doesn't mean Intelligent Design,

64
00:02:46.174 --> 00:02:48.008
and now this has really started

65
00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:50.472
creating almost a backlash as people

66
00:02:50.472 --> 00:02:52.072
are understanding that their questions

67
00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:54.397
are not being answered through traditional science.

68
00:02:54.397 --> 00:02:56.210
They're also not being answered

69
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.216
through traditional religions.

70
00:02:58.216 --> 00:03:01.639
And so there's a wee bit of a battle going on

71
00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.093
in that arena right now, and then Intelligent Design

72
00:03:04.093 --> 00:03:05.692
comes in to all of it and,

73
00:03:05.692 --> 00:03:07.238
I just wanted to make a quick comment

74
00:03:07.238 --> 00:03:08.252
that you point out in the book,

75
00:03:08.252 --> 00:03:10.407
even when you're talking about the Newtonian Principle,

76
00:03:10.407 --> 00:03:11.729
which we've gone on for so long.

77
00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:13.873
Even Newton had his own

78
00:03:13.873 --> 00:03:17.510
experiences of getting information from

79
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.795
somewhere besides his neural mass.

80
00:03:20.795 --> 00:03:22.971
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

81
00:03:22.971 --> 00:03:25.371
Newton was an occultist,

82
00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:29.072
so what people often don't realize is

83
00:03:29.072 --> 00:03:31.034
most of Newton's work

84
00:03:31.034 --> 00:03:33.029
was actually to do with the occult,

85
00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:34.491
to do with mysticism.

86
00:03:34.491 --> 00:03:37.605
A small fraction was what we'd call

87
00:03:37.605 --> 00:03:39.728
very clean mathematics, but you know what,

88
00:03:39.728 --> 00:03:42.170
even his mathematics was about really

89
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.709
understanding the universe at a very deep level.

90
00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.033
And he saw it in context.

91
00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:49.412
But what people have done is taken the mathematics

92
00:03:49.412 --> 00:03:51.727
and taken it out of its context

93
00:03:51.727 --> 00:03:54.351
and it's become a very dry science.

94
00:03:54.351 --> 00:03:56.228
So when we talk about Newtonian mechanics

95
00:03:56.228 --> 00:03:57.625
being very reductionist,

96
00:03:57.625 --> 00:03:59.204
we're not really talking about his work

97
00:03:59.204 --> 00:04:02.212
the way that he wants to, which is quite ironic, really,

98
00:04:02.212 --> 00:04:04.526
but that's what it's become.

99
00:04:04.526 --> 00:04:07.929
And absolutely, I don't mean that the Intelligent Design

100
00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:10.947
argument describing that.

101
00:04:10.947 --> 00:04:13.411
What I mean is consciousness,

102
00:04:13.411 --> 00:04:17.923
it's a logical conclusion from quantum physics

103
00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:21.431
that consciousness is fundamental to our universe.

104
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:25.869
And so this idea that, okay, biology, for example,

105
00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:27.245
does not add up.

106
00:04:27.245 --> 00:04:29.165
A lot of things in evolution.

107
00:04:29.165 --> 00:04:32.150
There's missing links that

108
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.785
make evolution quite hard to believe.

109
00:04:34.785 --> 00:04:37.964
So what a lot of Christian and religious groups have said,

110
00:04:37.964 --> 00:04:39.905
is okay, that means that God made everything

111
00:04:39.905 --> 00:04:41.281
and end of story.

112
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.604
But I'm not saying,

113
00:04:42.604 --> 00:04:44.289
that's the Intelligent Design story,

114
00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:45.846
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that,

115
00:04:45.846 --> 00:04:46.987
I'm just saying that

116
00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:50.123
if you take the conclusion from quantum physics,

117
00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.829
that consciousness is fundamental,

118
00:04:51.829 --> 00:04:54.027
and apply it to biology,

119
00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:56.000
you can start to see why consciousness

120
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.760
goes throughout all evolution,

121
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.725
and you can see an opening for conscious evolution

122
00:05:00.725 --> 00:05:03.424
that stays wholly within science,

123
00:05:03.424 --> 00:05:06.240
and doesn't have to look for religion or other ideas

124
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.586
for its inspiration.

125
00:05:08.586 --> 00:05:11.445
<v Host>True, and one of the examples you use,</v>

126
00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:13.588
we'll just jump in at this point now,

127
00:05:13.588 --> 00:05:16.383
that I think exemplifies it,

128
00:05:16.383 --> 00:05:18.079
is the salamander.

129
00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:19.187
(laughing)

130
00:05:19.187 --> 00:05:20.927
And looking at the cell,

131
00:05:20.927 --> 00:05:22.825
an unfertilized cell of a salamander,

132
00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:25.022
why is it that the energetic imprint

133
00:05:25.022 --> 00:05:27.746
of the entire animal is seen?

134
00:05:29.586 --> 00:05:30.398
Why is that?

135
00:05:30.398 --> 00:05:32.787
<v ->Absolutely, because that's work</v>

136
00:05:32.787 --> 00:05:34.332
that was done by

137
00:05:34.332 --> 00:05:38.440
Professor Harold Saxton Burr in the 1950s.

138
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.341
And, so that's a really amazing,

139
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:44.605
it's against mechanistic science,

140
00:05:44.605 --> 00:05:47.144
that the actual imprint of a salamander

141
00:05:47.144 --> 00:05:49.565
is actually even around the unfertilized cell,

142
00:05:49.565 --> 00:05:52.498
you can actually see the electrical fields.

143
00:05:52.498 --> 00:05:57.084
And this is a kind of higher dimensional imprint,

144
00:05:57.084 --> 00:06:00.423
a blueprint that is around all of life.

145
00:06:00.423 --> 00:06:04.903
So it tells us that this imprint actually exists

146
00:06:04.903 --> 00:06:07.740
even before the physical exists.

147
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.182
So, we're starting to understand now

148
00:06:10.182 --> 00:06:13.062
that there's stuff beyond the physical,

149
00:06:13.062 --> 00:06:14.662
there's a level beyond the physical,

150
00:06:14.662 --> 00:06:17.062
and that's where the real intelligence and the consciousness

151
00:06:17.062 --> 00:06:20.560
exists and the physical actually follows that consciousness

152
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.344
and intelligence in order to take form.

153
00:06:23.344 --> 00:06:25.339
<v Host>Yes, another case in point would be</v>

154
00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:29.040
the notion that mice,

155
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.644
for example, possess 95% of the same DNA as human beings.

156
00:06:32.644 --> 00:06:35.439
Now what would be the differentiating factor there

157
00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:36.964
(laughing)
to create a human being

158
00:06:36.964 --> 00:06:38.842
versus a mouse?
(laughing)

159
00:06:38.842 --> 00:06:40.922
<v ->Well you know what, they smell better.</v>

160
00:06:40.922 --> 00:06:41.956
(laughing)

161
00:06:41.956 --> 00:06:43.620
<v Host>And they can smell better than we can.</v>

162
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.441
<v ->Because the differ--</v>

163
00:06:44.441 --> 00:06:45.923
<v Host>More highly developed sense of smell.</v>

164
00:06:45.923 --> 00:06:48.483
<v ->That's right, the only difference between</v>

165
00:06:48.483 --> 00:06:51.918
mice and ourselves are the genes for the

166
00:06:51.918 --> 00:06:55.214
olfactory systems, so some olfactory proteins in mice

167
00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:57.497
are better, so that's their sense of smell.

168
00:06:57.497 --> 00:06:59.852
So that's quite interesting but,

169
00:07:01.542 --> 00:07:03.822
what it gives us is that we can't look to our genes

170
00:07:03.822 --> 00:07:05.059
for who we are.

171
00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:07.160
We've got to look deeper to our genes as to

172
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.400
what is actually controlling our cells,

173
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.741
and people who are involved with Conscious Media Network

174
00:07:13.741 --> 00:07:15.501
will probably have heard of Bruce Lipton.

175
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:18.658
And so Bruce Lipton has done a lot of work on this

176
00:07:18.658 --> 00:07:22.103
and how the cells are not controlled by our DNA,

177
00:07:22.103 --> 00:07:24.983
but actually the triggers come from outside.

178
00:07:24.983 --> 00:07:26.945
The perception of the environment

179
00:07:26.945 --> 00:07:29.303
is what sends the signal back through the cell

180
00:07:29.303 --> 00:07:30.977
and into the DNA.

181
00:07:30.977 --> 00:07:33.344
And, what I'm saying is like, if you tie that

182
00:07:33.344 --> 00:07:35.340
with the quantum physics, that consciousness

183
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.249
is fundamental to reality,

184
00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:41.408
you then have, deep into the atom level,

185
00:07:41.408 --> 00:07:44.566
where consciousness is actually driving the cells

186
00:07:44.566 --> 00:07:46.126
and driving our biology.

187
00:07:47.264 --> 00:07:48.425
<v Host>And when you get down to it,</v>

188
00:07:48.425 --> 00:07:51.861
you have to go deep into quantum physics

189
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:54.836
to really begin understanding the how-so of all of this.

190
00:07:54.836 --> 00:07:57.225
Right down to the notion of particles and waves

191
00:07:57.225 --> 00:07:59.721
or particles that are waves of probability.

192
00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:02.303
And can you talk about what that actually means?

193
00:08:02.303 --> 00:08:04.958
Because this is everything, this is huge.

194
00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:05.897
<v ->Yes, yes.</v>

195
00:08:05.897 --> 00:08:08.062
<v Host>So can you just speak to that for a moment?</v>

196
00:08:08.062 --> 00:08:10.419
<v ->What's interesting is when we look at everything</v>

197
00:08:10.419 --> 00:08:12.361
around us, we think that it's solid.

198
00:08:12.361 --> 00:08:14.579
But, what the quantum physicists did

199
00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:17.384
in the early 20th century,

200
00:08:17.384 --> 00:08:19.379
is when they looked deep into an atom,

201
00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:22.631
they found that it was made up of lots of empty space

202
00:08:22.631 --> 00:08:25.213
with all these sub-atomic particles buzzing around.

203
00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:28.776
And deep to that, to these sub-atomic particles,

204
00:08:28.776 --> 00:08:32.519
they behaved in a way that wasn't very solid at all, either.

205
00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:36.039
And they exist as a kind of wave of probability,

206
00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:40.599
so it's really an idea of where that particle might be.

207
00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:45.235
So, the idea is spread out around this probability wave,

208
00:08:45.235 --> 00:08:48.721
which is really a sort of mathematical function.

209
00:08:48.721 --> 00:08:50.204
And it's only when the particle

210
00:08:50.204 --> 00:08:51.768
is measured in a certain way,

211
00:08:51.768 --> 00:08:53.421
does that collapse into what we would call

212
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:54.743
a point particle.

213
00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:57.879
And a lot of experiments have been done on this.

214
00:08:57.879 --> 00:09:00.759
Very famous experiments, the double slit experiments.

215
00:09:00.759 --> 00:09:03.543
And some of these are the most famous and successful

216
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.644
experiments in scientific history.

217
00:09:05.644 --> 00:09:09.218
So they tell us that our reality is really weird.

218
00:09:09.218 --> 00:09:12.481
Sometimes it behaves like a wave, sometimes like a particle.

219
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:16.257
And the thing is, this behavior is what makes up

220
00:09:16.257 --> 00:09:18.170
all of the things that we see around us

221
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.392
that we think of as solid.

222
00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:22.027
So, within science itself,

223
00:09:22.027 --> 00:09:26.730
you can't really look to a mechanistic, reductionist method,

224
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.504
because we have quantum physics, which tells us

225
00:09:29.504 --> 00:09:30.890
that it's not so.

226
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.686
That we'd like to, maybe, stay in this solid world,

227
00:09:33.686 --> 00:09:36.148
some of us, but what's happening is

228
00:09:36.148 --> 00:09:37.684
that we're moving into this awareness,

229
00:09:37.684 --> 00:09:39.211
and with films like "What the Bleep,"

230
00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:42.207
and all the books that have come out in recent years

231
00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:45.044
telling us about the implications of quantum physics.

232
00:09:45.044 --> 00:09:47.870
We're realizing it's not as simple as that.

233
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.822
We're moving into this brave new world where

234
00:09:49.822 --> 00:09:52.029
we have a different interaction with our reality.

235
00:09:52.029 --> 00:09:53.866
And people are now more comfortable with that,

236
00:09:53.866 --> 00:09:56.745
whereas maybe last century they weren't so before.

237
00:09:56.745 --> 00:09:58.270
<v Host>Right, they're becoming more comfortable,</v>

238
00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.720
there's still an awful lot of resistance,

239
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.968
<v ->Yes, absolutely.</v>

240
00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:02.366
<v Host>in our left brain culture.</v>

241
00:10:02.366 --> 00:10:05.181
But, just to go back for a moment to probability,

242
00:10:05.181 --> 00:10:07.388
just the notion of probability

243
00:10:07.388 --> 00:10:09.662
is waiting for another influence

244
00:10:09.662 --> 00:10:11.241
to create an outcome.

245
00:10:11.241 --> 00:10:12.424
<v ->Yes, yeah.</v>

246
00:10:12.424 --> 00:10:13.949
<v Host>And so what is that other influence?</v>

247
00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:16.839
<v ->The other influence is actually our own observation.</v>

248
00:10:20.299 --> 00:10:22.674
Until we measure the experiment,

249
00:10:24.094 --> 00:10:25.426
you don't know what the results are,

250
00:10:25.426 --> 00:10:27.506
and there's this famous thought experiment,

251
00:10:27.506 --> 00:10:29.788
it didn't really do this, by Schrödinger,

252
00:10:29.788 --> 00:10:31.025
Erwin Schrödinger.
<v Host>Oh yes,</v>

253
00:10:31.025 --> 00:10:32.285
the Schrödinger's cat.
(laughing)

254
00:10:32.285 --> 00:10:33.232
<v ->Schrödinger's cat.</v>

255
00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:35.366
And he was actually talking about it

256
00:10:35.366 --> 00:10:37.244
because he thought this idea was observed

257
00:10:37.244 --> 00:10:39.324
in quantum physics, so it was a kind of

258
00:10:39.324 --> 00:10:40.827
taking the mickey a little bit.

259
00:10:40.827 --> 00:10:44.113
The famous thought experiment is that

260
00:10:44.113 --> 00:10:48.368
if you put a cat in a box with a source of radioactivity

261
00:10:48.368 --> 00:10:50.854
that can release poison or maybe not.

262
00:10:53.164 --> 00:10:56.240
The radioactivity is so-called a random process.

263
00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.874
So 'til you open the box you don't know if

264
00:10:58.874 --> 00:11:00.602
the cat is dead or alive.

265
00:11:00.602 --> 00:11:03.301
So, it's in this strange state of super-position.

266
00:11:03.301 --> 00:11:05.497
So it's the very observation of the cat

267
00:11:05.497 --> 00:11:07.440
that determines its state.

268
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.095
And so it is with the sub-atomic particles,

269
00:11:10.095 --> 00:11:13.123
so it's the observations of particles

270
00:11:13.123 --> 00:11:14.820
that determines what it is.

271
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.601
So, for the first time in quantum physics

272
00:11:16.601 --> 00:11:19.375
it was our participation and our observation,

273
00:11:19.375 --> 00:11:21.017
and therefore our consciousness

274
00:11:21.017 --> 00:11:24.035
that actually determines reality.

275
00:11:24.035 --> 00:11:26.966
So, that's the thing that's got everybody excited now.

276
00:11:28.316 --> 00:11:29.668
We've had the experiments for many years,

277
00:11:29.668 --> 00:11:32.141
but it's seeping out into the public consciousness,

278
00:11:32.141 --> 00:11:34.744
our participation, our consciousness,

279
00:11:34.744 --> 00:11:37.389
our observation determines what reality is,

280
00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:39.074
so that's what's so exciting right now.

281
00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:40.556
<v Host>Let's take that a little bit further.</v>

282
00:11:40.556 --> 00:11:42.679
So we're talking about the notion of consciousness.

283
00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:44.674
If you look again to classical science,

284
00:11:44.674 --> 00:11:47.180
once the neurons stop firing and we're

285
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.444
considered to be technically, clinically dead,

286
00:11:50.444 --> 00:11:51.905
there should be no consciousness,

287
00:11:51.905 --> 00:11:54.017
but in reality there's still consciousness.

288
00:11:54.017 --> 00:11:55.404
And this has been done,

289
00:11:55.404 --> 00:11:57.878
not only anecdotally, there have been

290
00:11:57.878 --> 00:11:59.499
pseudo experiments.

291
00:11:59.499 --> 00:12:01.525
Actually, you talk about one situation of a woman

292
00:12:01.525 --> 00:12:03.338
who was taken to that point

293
00:12:03.338 --> 00:12:05.963
through an operation due to a brain aneurysm.

294
00:12:05.963 --> 00:12:08.896
Can you talk about that a little bit as an example

295
00:12:08.896 --> 00:12:12.042
of consciousness extending beyond physicality?

296
00:12:12.042 --> 00:12:13.856
<v ->Well absolutely, as you said,</v>

297
00:12:13.856 --> 00:12:17.280
the mechanistic idea of consciousness

298
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.981
is consciousness comes from neuronal firings in the brain

299
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:23.615
and nobody has ever been able to explain

300
00:12:23.615 --> 00:12:26.698
how those two dimensional firings

301
00:12:26.698 --> 00:12:30.139
actually bring into life

302
00:12:30.139 --> 00:12:32.646
these inner feelings that we have,

303
00:12:32.646 --> 00:12:34.885
these inner experiences that we all have.

304
00:12:34.885 --> 00:12:37.424
So, nevertheless,
(laughing)

305
00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:38.731
when people...

306
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:41.104
<v Host>How do they explain it away?</v>

307
00:12:41.104 --> 00:12:42.842
How is it classically explained away,

308
00:12:42.842 --> 00:12:44.762
just a "dunno"?
(laughing)

309
00:12:44.762 --> 00:12:46.919
<v ->Indeed, people are really trying to do this</v>

310
00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:47.631
at the moment,

311
00:12:47.631 --> 00:12:50.452
where consciousness neuroscience

312
00:12:50.452 --> 00:12:53.658
and consciousness were two different things almost before.

313
00:12:53.658 --> 00:12:58.131
It's a whole new field where people like Susan Blackmore

314
00:12:58.131 --> 00:13:00.589
are really looking into how is it that these neurons

315
00:13:00.589 --> 00:13:02.104
form consciousness.

316
00:13:02.104 --> 00:13:03.949
And there's all sorts of ideas

317
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:05.772
like three dimensional holograms,

318
00:13:05.772 --> 00:13:07.692
there's a number of--

319
00:13:07.692 --> 00:13:08.992
<v Host>So they're coming up with some ideas,</v>

320
00:13:08.992 --> 00:13:10.154
<v ->They're coming up with them.</v>

321
00:13:10.154 --> 00:13:12.256
<v Host>but speaking back to that anecdotally,</v>

322
00:13:12.256 --> 00:13:14.730
for example, that situation would actually occur.

323
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:16.310
<v ->Yeah, that was quite interesting, because it</v>

324
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:19.115
goes against all of the reductionist models.

325
00:13:19.115 --> 00:13:22.016
And this lady called Pam Reynolds

326
00:13:22.016 --> 00:13:24.512
who is very famous because

327
00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:27.253
when she actually had her operation

328
00:13:27.253 --> 00:13:30.218
she was taken really to the point of death.

329
00:13:30.218 --> 00:13:33.237
So her brain wasn't showing any activity, her heart

330
00:13:33.237 --> 00:13:34.975
wasn't showing any activity,

331
00:13:34.975 --> 00:13:37.429
and we have great records of this, because she was

332
00:13:37.429 --> 00:13:39.135
being monitored the whole time.

333
00:13:39.135 --> 00:13:42.314
So we have actual proof that the time that she was

334
00:13:42.314 --> 00:13:44.788
in this operation she was clinically dead,

335
00:13:44.788 --> 00:13:48.329
yet she remembers experiences from that operation.

336
00:13:48.329 --> 00:13:51.550
So she remembers floating above the surgical table,

337
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.376
she remembers the instruments that the surgeons were using.

338
00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:57.736
And these were instruments that weren't shown to her before

339
00:13:57.736 --> 00:13:58.835
the actual operation.

340
00:13:58.835 --> 00:14:00.552
But when she woke up after the operation

341
00:14:00.552 --> 00:14:02.110
she was able to talk about it.

342
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.147
She even remembers conversations

343
00:14:04.147 --> 00:14:07.229
that were actually documented by the doctors and nurses.

344
00:14:07.229 --> 00:14:10.930
So she remembers the things that were said around her

345
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.394
and the time that they were said as well.

346
00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:15.112
She's a very interesting case,

347
00:14:15.112 --> 00:14:17.554
because we have recorded the whole time,

348
00:14:17.554 --> 00:14:20.935
that she was effectively, physically, clinically dead.

349
00:14:20.935 --> 00:14:23.954
Because of that documentation, we can say,

350
00:14:23.954 --> 00:14:26.374
well okay, the brain was not firing.

351
00:14:26.374 --> 00:14:28.689
If consciousness comes out of the brain,

352
00:14:28.689 --> 00:14:31.153
the brain was not firing, we have proof of that.

353
00:14:31.153 --> 00:14:32.412
What was going on?

354
00:14:32.412 --> 00:14:33.585
Why did she have memories?

355
00:14:33.585 --> 00:14:36.006
Why could she hear things that were not actually

356
00:14:36.006 --> 00:14:37.905
said to her before?

357
00:14:37.905 --> 00:14:40.299
Why did she recognize the instruments?

358
00:14:40.299 --> 00:14:41.937
So the reductionist sciences,

359
00:14:41.937 --> 00:14:45.872
the whole newer sciences field,

360
00:14:45.872 --> 00:14:48.559
they just completely dismiss it.

361
00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:50.277
And often they do this with

362
00:14:50.277 --> 00:14:52.336
these sorts of cases.

363
00:14:52.336 --> 00:14:53.893
<v Host>When they're flummoxed they just say,</v>

364
00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.290
"Don't care to look at it,"

365
00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.613
and they don't look at it.

366
00:14:56.613 --> 00:14:59.013
<v ->Yeah, they don't, they don't care to look at it,</v>

367
00:14:59.013 --> 00:15:01.391
and they don't want to look at the data.

368
00:15:01.391 --> 00:15:03.439
But you know what, that's okay, because

369
00:15:03.439 --> 00:15:06.991
people only see what they're emotionally ready to see.

370
00:15:06.991 --> 00:15:10.958
And we can't go into judgement about all of this, because

371
00:15:12.828 --> 00:15:15.321
if a soul gets things too quickly for them,

372
00:15:15.321 --> 00:15:17.476
it's not a cosmic law.

373
00:15:17.476 --> 00:15:19.556
So all that's going on with all these scientists

374
00:15:19.556 --> 00:15:20.857
that are not able to see that,

375
00:15:20.857 --> 00:15:23.619
is it's cosmic law, it's the cosmic order of the universe,

376
00:15:23.619 --> 00:15:27.598
that they cannot, literally see this research.

377
00:15:27.598 --> 00:15:29.282
It's not possible for them to see it,

378
00:15:29.282 --> 00:15:30.616
(laughing)
and that's the cosmic--

379
00:15:30.616 --> 00:15:31.757
<v Host>Yes, that's very true.</v>

380
00:15:31.757 --> 00:15:32.813
Very well put.
<v ->That's a cosmic law</v>

381
00:15:32.813 --> 00:15:33.880
of consciousness.

382
00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.619
And so there's no judgement in it,

383
00:15:35.619 --> 00:15:37.122
in fact it's really great that there are

384
00:15:37.122 --> 00:15:40.403
skeptics out there, because it all adds

385
00:15:40.403 --> 00:15:42.417
to the mix, all adds to the color that we've got

386
00:15:42.417 --> 00:15:43.612
in science at the moment.

387
00:15:43.612 --> 00:15:46.012
But what's happening at the moment is more people

388
00:15:46.012 --> 00:15:47.836
are ready to face this.

389
00:15:47.836 --> 00:15:49.713
More people are intuitively feeling,

390
00:15:49.713 --> 00:15:51.494
"Hmm, that Pam Reynolds case, yeah,

391
00:15:51.494 --> 00:15:52.731
"I understand that.

392
00:15:52.731 --> 00:15:53.894
"Yeah, that makes sense to me."

393
00:15:53.894 --> 00:15:54.898
<v Host>And it's not just her, there are</v>

394
00:15:54.898 --> 00:15:56.988
thousands upon thousands of chronicled near-death

395
00:15:56.988 --> 00:15:58.470
experiences, for example,

396
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.582
where the exact same thing happens.

397
00:16:00.582 --> 00:16:01.724
They may have been clinically dead.

398
00:16:01.724 --> 00:16:03.505
Dannion Brinkley also on our site,

399
00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:05.085
clinically dead for what, 20-30 minutes.

400
00:16:06.385 --> 00:16:07.435
(laughing)

401
00:16:07.435 --> 00:16:08.715
Lying on a gurney in the hallway.

402
00:16:08.715 --> 00:16:10.432
(laughing)

403
00:16:10.432 --> 00:16:13.014
And the same thing, coming back with these very

404
00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:15.595
conscious, super-conscious experiences,

405
00:16:15.595 --> 00:16:19.594
so this brings us to another point I want to get into,

406
00:16:19.594 --> 00:16:21.692
because I find it fascinating which is,

407
00:16:23.082 --> 00:16:25.211
science doesn't understand right now

408
00:16:25.211 --> 00:16:26.566
how this can happen,

409
00:16:26.566 --> 00:16:27.665
how you can have experiences

410
00:16:27.665 --> 00:16:29.328
beyond the firings of the brain.

411
00:16:29.328 --> 00:16:31.910
Another area is memory.

412
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.565
And I really enjoyed that portion of the book,

413
00:16:34.565 --> 00:16:38.587
because it's bringing to light an entirely

414
00:16:38.587 --> 00:16:41.648
different model for what memory may be.

415
00:16:41.648 --> 00:16:45.476
In a nutshell, as I understand it, you're saying,

416
00:16:45.476 --> 00:16:47.631
since science can't exactly locate where these

417
00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:49.690
memories are in the brain,

418
00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.621
the truth is that the brain is more

419
00:16:51.621 --> 00:16:55.022
of a processing unit for processing information available

420
00:16:55.022 --> 00:16:56.559
in the quantum vacuum,

421
00:16:56.559 --> 00:16:58.596
in the universal mind,

422
00:16:58.596 --> 00:16:59.535
whatever you wanna call it.

423
00:16:59.535 --> 00:17:00.377
(laughing)

424
00:17:00.377 --> 00:17:01.380
Can you talk about that,

425
00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.516
because that is mind-blowing to a lot of people,

426
00:17:04.516 --> 00:17:07.939
and yet it seems so fundamentally true!

427
00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:10.195
<v ->Yeah,</v>

428
00:17:11.495 --> 00:17:13.582
it's really amazing to think that

429
00:17:13.582 --> 00:17:16.249
mainstream science really doesn't know about

430
00:17:16.249 --> 00:17:17.507
how memory is formed.

431
00:17:17.507 --> 00:17:19.566
They know

432
00:17:19.566 --> 00:17:22.648
certain remodelling processes that happen in the brain,

433
00:17:22.648 --> 00:17:24.867
but they don't know what triggers it.

434
00:17:24.867 --> 00:17:28.120
They can see that somebody has a bad short-term memory,

435
00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.146
that they have certain processes happening.

436
00:17:30.146 --> 00:17:32.504
But what is the fundamental thing that is driving

437
00:17:32.504 --> 00:17:33.399
all this?

438
00:17:33.399 --> 00:17:34.766
And that's not

439
00:17:36.006 --> 00:17:37.488
answered in neuroscience at all.

440
00:17:38.758 --> 00:17:40.816
If we take this idea that actually consciousness

441
00:17:40.816 --> 00:17:43.472
is fundamental and not coming from the brain,

442
00:17:43.472 --> 00:17:46.075
then the brain becomes a sort of transmitter device

443
00:17:46.075 --> 00:17:47.290
for consciousness.

444
00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.616
It still is important, and all of the neuroscience

445
00:17:49.616 --> 00:17:52.570
that is done with the modern scans, the PET scans,

446
00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.269
and all of these types of scans that are looking at

447
00:17:55.269 --> 00:17:58.530
the way that the blood flows and the brain flows.

448
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.679
When certain thought process are going on,

449
00:18:01.679 --> 00:18:03.577
they're all relevant, and they're all important,

450
00:18:03.577 --> 00:18:05.785
but they're showing the way consciousness flows.

451
00:18:05.785 --> 00:18:08.622
They're not actually the fundamental aspect

452
00:18:08.622 --> 00:18:09.742
of what's going on.

453
00:18:09.742 --> 00:18:11.417
The brain is just transmitting.

454
00:18:13.097 --> 00:18:14.702
What I'm saying in the book is,

455
00:18:14.702 --> 00:18:18.403
using another fundamental part of quantum physics,

456
00:18:18.403 --> 00:18:19.779
which is that,

457
00:18:19.779 --> 00:18:21.048
do you remember I said that

458
00:18:21.048 --> 00:18:23.117
the wave is a probability
<v Host>Mhm.</v>

459
00:18:23.117 --> 00:18:24.877
<v ->of where the particle might be?</v>

460
00:18:24.877 --> 00:18:26.442
Well, Heisenberg realized that

461
00:18:26.442 --> 00:18:28.021
if a particle

462
00:18:29.571 --> 00:18:31.167
could be anywhere along this wave,

463
00:18:31.167 --> 00:18:32.564
so it could be in this room,

464
00:18:32.564 --> 00:18:35.209
it could be on the Eiffel Tower, it could be anywhere.

465
00:18:35.209 --> 00:18:39.006
So what you have around us are lots and lots

466
00:18:39.006 --> 00:18:41.001
of particles called virtual particles

467
00:18:41.001 --> 00:18:42.804
popping in and out of existence.

468
00:18:42.804 --> 00:18:45.449
So you have a sea of light surrounding us

469
00:18:45.449 --> 00:18:47.166
that's just popping in and out.

470
00:18:47.166 --> 00:18:48.905
So these are these virtual particles

471
00:18:48.905 --> 00:18:50.345
that now you see them, now you don't,

472
00:18:50.345 --> 00:18:51.368
kinda concept.

473
00:18:51.368 --> 00:18:55.560
And what these particles can be seen as also, are waves.

474
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.870
Do you remember I said,
<v Host>Mhm.</v>

475
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.160
<v ->there's wave particle duality</v>

476
00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.285
depending on how you see them.

477
00:18:59.285 --> 00:19:01.568
So these waves can interconnect.

478
00:19:01.568 --> 00:19:04.042
And these interconnecting waves of light

479
00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:05.760
are all around us.

480
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.664
And where they interconnect, the actual crosspoint,

481
00:19:09.664 --> 00:19:11.967
is where lots of information can be held.

482
00:19:11.967 --> 00:19:14.943
In fact that's the most efficient information

483
00:19:14.943 --> 00:19:16.884
storage device known to us.

484
00:19:18.464 --> 00:19:20.948
And this is where all the information is held

485
00:19:20.948 --> 00:19:22.915
from past, present, future,

486
00:19:22.915 --> 00:19:24.329
of everything that's ever happened,

487
00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:28.936
every single soul is held in all of these interconnections.

488
00:19:28.936 --> 00:19:31.934
And because the universe is holographic, and we know this

489
00:19:31.934 --> 00:19:33.833
not just from, this isn't a sort of,

490
00:19:33.833 --> 00:19:36.691
"As above, so below," just a hermetic idea.

491
00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:39.294
It's also an idea from mainstream physics.

492
00:19:39.294 --> 00:19:40.755
Lee Smolin,

493
00:19:40.755 --> 00:19:43.987
who produced something called Loop Quantum Gravity,

494
00:19:43.987 --> 00:19:45.907
which is one of the leading physics theories,

495
00:19:45.907 --> 00:19:47.975
says that the universe is holographic.

496
00:19:47.975 --> 00:19:50.450
And that means that every single part of the universe

497
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.669
contains the information of the whole.

498
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:56.828
So all of that information is available to us,

499
00:19:56.828 --> 00:20:00.231
of everything and everyone that's ever happened.

500
00:20:00.231 --> 00:20:03.249
All we have to do is tune ourselves to be

501
00:20:03.249 --> 00:20:07.271
good receivers of this information, hence channeling,

502
00:20:07.271 --> 00:20:09.948
mediumship, all of those things that were previously

503
00:20:09.948 --> 00:20:13.286
unexplainable, we now have a mechanism

504
00:20:13.286 --> 00:20:16.453
and all we've used is quantum physics and logic

505
00:20:16.453 --> 00:20:18.491
to achieve that mechanism.

506
00:20:18.491 --> 00:20:21.253
So, thoughts and inspiration,

507
00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:23.344
they all come from this quantum field,

508
00:20:23.344 --> 00:20:25.125
and they just come through the brain.

509
00:20:25.125 --> 00:20:26.832
That's why you have these moments of genius.

510
00:20:26.832 --> 00:20:28.184
(laughing)
<v Host>Absolutely, in fact,</v>

511
00:20:29.574 --> 00:20:30.780
I'm sitting here grinning because

512
00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.553
about 15 or 20 years ago, that's exactly

513
00:20:33.553 --> 00:20:35.878
what happened to me in a meditation.

514
00:20:37.548 --> 00:20:39.259
I was fairly deep,

515
00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:42.544
and I was shown the nature of how information

516
00:20:42.544 --> 00:20:44.059
exists and is stored.

517
00:20:44.059 --> 00:20:47.120
And I was shown basically a pattern,

518
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.562
a gridlike pattern with lines intersecting.

519
00:20:49.562 --> 00:20:52.666
And where the lines intersected this light would come out

520
00:20:52.666 --> 00:20:55.365
at the cross section, and I was shown that that is

521
00:20:55.365 --> 00:20:57.242
how information is stored

522
00:20:57.242 --> 00:21:00.399
in the lattice, for lack of a better word back then,

523
00:21:00.399 --> 00:21:02.380
'cause I hadn't really started studying

524
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.611
quantum physics yet then.

525
00:21:03.611 --> 00:21:05.574
And it was showing exactly the very thing

526
00:21:05.574 --> 00:21:07.600
you're talking about and it made complete sense

527
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.691
in that moment, but there was nowhere to put it.

528
00:21:09.691 --> 00:21:11.162
(laughing)
<v ->Oh, wonderful.</v>

529
00:21:11.162 --> 00:21:12.336
<v Host>So when I was reading about</v>

530
00:21:12.336 --> 00:21:13.573
the interference patterns in your book

531
00:21:13.573 --> 00:21:15.322
and other things through the years, I thought,

532
00:21:15.322 --> 00:21:17.125
"Bingo, that's what I was being shown"

533
00:21:17.125 --> 00:21:20.005
for reasons not understood to me at the time,

534
00:21:20.005 --> 00:21:22.745
why I needed to know that but I found it interesting.

535
00:21:22.745 --> 00:21:25.913
And so this gets into other areas though,

536
00:21:25.913 --> 00:21:28.004
that really become at the heart of

537
00:21:29.594 --> 00:21:32.239
a lot of what I think the resistance in science is to

538
00:21:32.239 --> 00:21:33.966
and that is the notion, once you start going

539
00:21:33.966 --> 00:21:36.921
through the area of quantum physics,

540
00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:40.238
it starts taking you into hyperspace, Michio Kaku.

541
00:21:40.238 --> 00:21:42.883
It starts taking you into the notion of other dimensions,

542
00:21:42.883 --> 00:21:45.539
and suddenly everything starts becoming crystal clear

543
00:21:45.539 --> 00:21:47.224
and making sense.

544
00:21:47.224 --> 00:21:49.325
So can we talk about that?

545
00:21:49.325 --> 00:21:50.723
<v ->The higher dimensions.</v>

546
00:21:50.723 --> 00:21:51.960
<v Host>The higher dimensions,</v>

547
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.979
and where the notion of the higher dimensions

548
00:21:54.979 --> 00:21:58.882
have actually begun filling in the scientific questions,

549
00:21:58.882 --> 00:22:01.218
the gaps in knowledge.

550
00:22:01.218 --> 00:22:04.418
<v ->That's a really interesting area of physics at the moment.</v>

551
00:22:04.418 --> 00:22:07.255
That's an area called String Theory,

552
00:22:07.255 --> 00:22:10.380
which is, definitely in the '90s

553
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.396
it was one of the leading physics theories,

554
00:22:12.396 --> 00:22:15.116
which said that the universe, every single particle,

555
00:22:15.116 --> 00:22:17.643
every single force, is actually a

556
00:22:17.643 --> 00:22:20.043
tiny, vibrating packet of energy.

557
00:22:20.043 --> 00:22:23.254
And these tiny, vibrating packets of energy,

558
00:22:23.254 --> 00:22:24.854
or strings as they're called,

559
00:22:24.854 --> 00:22:27.648
they can vibrate in different dimensions.

560
00:22:27.648 --> 00:22:29.269
We're used to three dimensions,

561
00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:31.488
like you go side to side, up and down,

562
00:22:31.488 --> 00:22:32.768
backwards and forwards,

563
00:22:32.768 --> 00:22:35.072
and then the other dimension is time is often added.

564
00:22:35.072 --> 00:22:37.653
So sometimes we talk about a four dimensional world.

565
00:22:37.653 --> 00:22:39.327
But most people know what you mean

566
00:22:39.327 --> 00:22:41.968
when care to talk about three spatial dimensions.

567
00:22:41.968 --> 00:22:45.829
Now, strings vibrate in not just these three dimensions,

568
00:22:45.829 --> 00:22:47.941
but many, many higher dimensions

569
00:22:47.941 --> 00:22:49.903
and that's difficult for us to realize,

570
00:22:51.293 --> 00:22:53.295
to understand because we can't really

571
00:22:53.295 --> 00:22:55.620
see that perspective.

572
00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.457
But this a bona fide branch of physics

573
00:22:58.457 --> 00:23:02.852
and the idea of hyperspace and these many dimensions

574
00:23:02.852 --> 00:23:05.934
are useful for all sorts of areas of physics at the moment,

575
00:23:05.934 --> 00:23:07.939
so it's a very popular idea right now.

576
00:23:07.939 --> 00:23:10.851
But when you put that together with our first idea,

577
00:23:10.851 --> 00:23:14.318
that you've got this fundamental nature of consciousness,

578
00:23:14.318 --> 00:23:16.558
you then have many dimensions of consciousness

579
00:23:16.558 --> 00:23:17.762
in the universe.

580
00:23:17.762 --> 00:23:19.939
Okay, so what does that do for us?

581
00:23:19.939 --> 00:23:20.643
Well,

582
00:23:22.253 --> 00:23:25.656
who can reside in these higher dimensions of consciousness?

583
00:23:25.656 --> 00:23:29.026
And I started to realize that this is probably the realm

584
00:23:29.026 --> 00:23:32.492
of angels and spirit guides, nefarious or,

585
00:23:32.492 --> 00:23:36.492
even entities, everything that you can imagine.

586
00:23:36.492 --> 00:23:38.028
And I'm not saying that angels

587
00:23:38.028 --> 00:23:39.671
and all of these things exist,

588
00:23:39.671 --> 00:23:42.294
although I've had personal experience of them.

589
00:23:42.294 --> 00:23:44.289
I'm not trying to convince anyone that they exist,

590
00:23:44.289 --> 00:23:46.689
I'm just saying from the physics and the science

591
00:23:46.689 --> 00:23:48.108
that we have already,

592
00:23:48.108 --> 00:23:50.689
there's no reason in the world why they can't exist

593
00:23:50.689 --> 00:23:52.853
because we have the mechanism for them

594
00:23:52.853 --> 00:23:54.347
right in front of us.

595
00:23:54.347 --> 00:23:58.390
<v Host>We do, and this is where all the squabbles</v>

596
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:59.606
seem to come in.

597
00:23:59.606 --> 00:24:01.493
You have scientists saying, "Oh, charlatan,

598
00:24:01.493 --> 00:24:03.488
"talking to angels and so forth."

599
00:24:03.488 --> 00:24:05.109
But you have very

600
00:24:05.109 --> 00:24:08.352
highly credentialed people throughout history,

601
00:24:08.352 --> 00:24:11.072
I mean everywhere from Socrates forward,

602
00:24:12.072 --> 00:24:14.475
who admit to having obtained their information

603
00:24:14.475 --> 00:24:16.715
from an unseen force or voice or

604
00:24:16.715 --> 00:24:18.496
actual being that appears to them.

605
00:24:18.496 --> 00:24:20.597
Do you care to give some examples and speak to

606
00:24:20.597 --> 00:24:22.720
some of that just to let everyone know

607
00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.394
this isn't something new.

608
00:24:24.394 --> 00:24:26.517
(laughing)
<v ->Absolutely, we're talk--</v>

609
00:24:26.517 --> 00:24:27.498
<v Host>It's not New Age.</v>

610
00:24:27.498 --> 00:24:28.959
(laughing)
<v ->It's not New Age, absolutely</v>

611
00:24:28.959 --> 00:24:30.602
we talk about all this being

612
00:24:32.022 --> 00:24:34.539
something New Age and something just of our times

613
00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:37.238
but look throughout history as you say.

614
00:24:37.238 --> 00:24:38.486
There's Joan of Arc.

615
00:24:38.486 --> 00:24:42.560
She clearly heard a divine voice talking to her.

616
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.344
And she was able to do things

617
00:24:45.344 --> 00:24:47.946
that seemed super human.

618
00:24:47.946 --> 00:24:51.765
A young girl leading an army against the English

619
00:24:51.765 --> 00:24:53.205
was just amazing.

620
00:24:53.205 --> 00:24:54.538
She was only in her teens,

621
00:24:54.538 --> 00:24:56.244
but she had that sense of conviction

622
00:24:56.244 --> 00:24:58.879
because of the spiritual dimension that she heard

623
00:24:58.879 --> 00:25:02.580
and she said in her journals that she heard angels.

624
00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.366
There's also, if you look at Islam,

625
00:25:06.366 --> 00:25:08.500
Muhammad was supposed to have heard

626
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.526
an angel Gabriel speaking to him,

627
00:25:10.526 --> 00:25:13.523
and he was just a relatively ordinary guy

628
00:25:13.523 --> 00:25:15.923
who heard this voice

629
00:25:15.923 --> 00:25:18.216
and that's how a whole religion got started.

630
00:25:18.216 --> 00:25:20.073
And you see, there's many examples and--

631
00:25:20.073 --> 00:25:21.160
<v Host>Well, the Virgin Mary.</v>

632
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.419
Angels throughout the Bible as well.

633
00:25:22.419 --> 00:25:23.464
<v ->Many in the Bible.</v>

634
00:25:23.464 --> 00:25:24.530
<v Host>But not only that.</v>

635
00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:25.683
Throughout the world of science.

636
00:25:25.683 --> 00:25:26.781
<v ->Throughout the world.</v>

637
00:25:26.781 --> 00:25:29.469
Yeah, there's many examples of people getting

638
00:25:29.469 --> 00:25:32.146
inspiration from dreams

639
00:25:32.146 --> 00:25:34.482
or just out of nowhere.

640
00:25:34.482 --> 00:25:36.646
I mentioned Gerard Mcgagio in my book.

641
00:25:36.646 --> 00:25:39.531
He said "It fell out of the sky," his theory.

642
00:25:39.531 --> 00:25:41.142
Where does this all come from?

643
00:25:43.322 --> 00:25:46.539
It's just amazingly rich, it's not a new thing at all.

644
00:25:47.929 --> 00:25:50.326
It's great that people can start to talk about this

645
00:25:50.326 --> 00:25:53.141
more openly, and there's more of a dialogue going on

646
00:25:53.141 --> 00:25:55.339
about people's experiences right now.

647
00:25:55.339 --> 00:25:57.237
<v Host>And what I like in what you've done</v>

648
00:25:57.237 --> 00:25:58.442
is you're really

649
00:25:59.612 --> 00:26:02.581
taking the, in a sense you're adding mysticism

650
00:26:02.581 --> 00:26:04.629
back to science, but you're taking it out of it

651
00:26:04.629 --> 00:26:06.143
at the same time.
(laughing)

652
00:26:06.143 --> 00:26:09.727
In that you're allowing for consciousness to bubble up

653
00:26:09.727 --> 00:26:12.842
through all of this in connecting the dots,

654
00:26:12.842 --> 00:26:16.649
and to allow for people to begin exploring

655
00:26:16.649 --> 00:26:19.295
the notion of their own consciousness.

656
00:26:19.295 --> 00:26:21.534
And allowing what they have felt maybe

657
00:26:21.534 --> 00:26:23.849
have been anomalous events in their lives

658
00:26:23.849 --> 00:26:25.194
or the lives of others,

659
00:26:25.194 --> 00:26:28.574
to start taking some place of importance in their lives.

660
00:26:28.574 --> 00:26:30.227
So we need to begin listening,

661
00:26:30.227 --> 00:26:32.968
if we're living in a multi-dimensional universe.

662
00:26:32.968 --> 00:26:35.965
And Michio Kaku says they've been able to measure

663
00:26:35.965 --> 00:26:37.714
up to eleven dimensions now.

664
00:26:37.714 --> 00:26:39.708
<v ->Maybe more, 26.</v>

665
00:26:39.708 --> 00:26:40.916
<v Host>There may be more, 26, yes.</v>

666
00:26:40.916 --> 00:26:42.109
(laughing)

667
00:26:42.109 --> 00:26:44.477
Well, on camera he would only say for sure eleven,

668
00:26:45.947 --> 00:26:48.477
but that's a lot since we're living in only three,

669
00:26:48.477 --> 00:26:50.631
supposedly, or four debateably.

670
00:26:50.631 --> 00:26:54.492
So if we're looking at the notion of many, many dimensions,

671
00:26:54.492 --> 00:26:58.236
then we're looking at the notion of people or beings

672
00:26:58.236 --> 00:27:01.511
perhaps like you and I, sitting in this very space we're in,

673
00:27:01.511 --> 00:27:04.358
doing something else or something similar.

674
00:27:04.358 --> 00:27:06.918
We're not aware of them, they're not aware of us

675
00:27:06.918 --> 00:27:08.454
because we're at different densities,

676
00:27:08.454 --> 00:27:10.011
we're at different frequencies.

677
00:27:10.011 --> 00:27:12.273
And it's really that simple.

678
00:27:13.823 --> 00:27:15.941
Why does it seem that it's such

679
00:27:15.941 --> 00:27:18.352
a complex thing for people to get their minds around?

680
00:27:18.352 --> 00:27:22.139
What are we blocked en masse, where are we

681
00:27:22.139 --> 00:27:24.240
blocked en masse at the notion that

682
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.394
we could have teams of people in this room

683
00:27:26.394 --> 00:27:28.794
with us in other dimensions doing many things.

684
00:27:28.794 --> 00:27:32.089
<v ->Well I think a lot of it is to do with</v>

685
00:27:33.499 --> 00:27:35.076
expansion of awareness.

686
00:27:35.076 --> 00:27:39.737
And it's all existing around us, but we're not aware of it.

687
00:27:42.017 --> 00:27:44.079
A lot of that journey to awareness is actually

688
00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:45.753
working on ourselves,

689
00:27:45.753 --> 00:27:49.184
our actual inner emotions.

690
00:27:49.184 --> 00:27:53.567
If people are very bogged down with emotional troubles,

691
00:27:54.857 --> 00:27:56.352
they can't expand.

692
00:27:56.352 --> 00:27:59.029
They're feeling so,

693
00:27:59.029 --> 00:28:01.290
I worked with underprivileged families

694
00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.392
in England at some point

695
00:28:03.392 --> 00:28:06.687
and what was very interesting was

696
00:28:06.687 --> 00:28:09.173
these families actually did want to move on

697
00:28:09.173 --> 00:28:11.989
with their lives, but because of things that were just

698
00:28:11.989 --> 00:28:14.634
holding them back from their emotions of childhood,

699
00:28:14.634 --> 00:28:17.887
they were unable to get through that inner prison.

700
00:28:17.887 --> 00:28:20.052
And as soon as the emotional work had actually

701
00:28:20.052 --> 00:28:22.889
been done with them, they expanded their awareness,

702
00:28:22.889 --> 00:28:25.566
and they started becoming aware of the other dimensions.

703
00:28:25.566 --> 00:28:28.973
They started to heal, they started to learn how to be

704
00:28:28.973 --> 00:28:31.218
Reiki healers and all sorts of things

705
00:28:31.218 --> 00:28:34.131
and they also started to go back to work

706
00:28:34.131 --> 00:28:36.072
and expand their lives.

707
00:28:36.072 --> 00:28:38.312
So I think a lot of the things that needed to be done

708
00:28:38.312 --> 00:28:39.752
to actually expand awareness

709
00:28:39.752 --> 00:28:41.714
is actually the inner emotional work.

710
00:28:41.714 --> 00:28:44.568
And when that happens, you can actually

711
00:28:44.568 --> 00:28:47.015
shift frequency, 'cause what you're doing,

712
00:28:47.015 --> 00:28:49.959
as I mentioned Dean Martini in my book,

713
00:28:49.959 --> 00:28:51.954
you're actually bringing together this sort of

714
00:28:51.954 --> 00:28:54.716
matter, the electron which is the matter region

715
00:28:54.716 --> 00:28:57.298
and the positron which is the anti-matter region,

716
00:28:57.298 --> 00:28:59.676
where all your sub-conscious emotions are held.

717
00:28:59.676 --> 00:29:01.522
And those two, if they're too heavy,

718
00:29:01.522 --> 00:29:03.398
they'll hold you down in space and time.

719
00:29:03.398 --> 00:29:06.320
But when you bring that emotional awareness to your life,

720
00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.017
you're actually joining the two together

721
00:29:08.017 --> 00:29:09.638
and moving that into light.

722
00:29:09.638 --> 00:29:12.539
And that moves you higher and higher in your own life

723
00:29:12.539 --> 00:29:14.640
and expands your awareness.

724
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.319
It doesn't necessarily make your life more simple,

725
00:29:17.319 --> 00:29:19.376
but what it does is it expands your awareness

726
00:29:19.376 --> 00:29:21.317
so you're able to look up and see

727
00:29:21.317 --> 00:29:23.099
and become aware of the things around you

728
00:29:23.099 --> 00:29:25.274
and even multi-dimensions.

729
00:29:25.274 --> 00:29:27.493
So that, on a global scale

730
00:29:27.493 --> 00:29:29.178
is really what's happening right now.

731
00:29:29.178 --> 00:29:30.373
<v Host>It really is.</v>

732
00:29:30.373 --> 00:29:31.834
It seems like we've reached that,

733
00:29:33.134 --> 00:29:34.875
for lack of a better metaphor, hundredth monkey

734
00:29:34.875 --> 00:29:36.474
(laughing)
place.

735
00:29:36.474 --> 00:29:38.394
And like you say, a lot of the healing,

736
00:29:38.394 --> 00:29:40.697
a lot of the new healing modalities that are taking place

737
00:29:40.697 --> 00:29:42.073
are actually,

738
00:29:42.073 --> 00:29:43.833
would be considered to be inter-dimensional

739
00:29:43.833 --> 00:29:45.199
in nature.

740
00:29:45.199 --> 00:29:48.174
And so to be able to open up to the very highest

741
00:29:48.174 --> 00:29:50.542
possibilities in healing, we have to

742
00:29:50.542 --> 00:29:52.174
at least come out of the,

743
00:29:52.174 --> 00:29:54.542
you said we were prisoners to our emotions.

744
00:29:54.542 --> 00:29:56.579
We also have to come out of the mental prisons.

745
00:29:56.579 --> 00:29:59.560
Because out of fear of being ridiculed.

746
00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.243
<v ->Again, fear is an emotion.</v>

747
00:30:02.243 --> 00:30:05.240
So fear of being ridiculed, fear of being embarrassed,

748
00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.941
I think is such a human drive that is often ignored

749
00:30:08.941 --> 00:30:12.439
because it probly comes from, again,

750
00:30:12.439 --> 00:30:15.543
more of the animal instincts in us, I think,

751
00:30:15.543 --> 00:30:18.882
where if we are embarrassed we'll be left out of the tribe,

752
00:30:18.882 --> 00:30:21.100
we won't have the comfort of the tribe.

753
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.897
I think that's a huge drive which we often don't address.

754
00:30:24.897 --> 00:30:27.020
That emotion, what that feels like.

755
00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.561
But you've been talking to David Ack-Rees again,

756
00:30:30.561 --> 00:30:32.236
if anybody knows this it's him.

757
00:30:32.236 --> 00:30:36.299
And he talks about the freedom that you get

758
00:30:36.299 --> 00:30:38.635
when you actually go forth and speak your true voice

759
00:30:38.635 --> 00:30:40.000
no matter what.

760
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.062
And he really knows where he's coming from on that.

761
00:30:43.062 --> 00:30:45.970
So there is that freedom if you break through that ridicule

762
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:47.848
and break through that embarrassment,

763
00:30:47.848 --> 00:30:50.663
you'll actually find a lot more in your life than before.

764
00:30:50.663 --> 00:30:53.309
<v Host>And these aren't new concepts, these are old,</v>

765
00:30:53.309 --> 00:30:54.770
these are ancient.

766
00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:57.759
A lot of the ancient religions

767
00:30:57.759 --> 00:31:02.417
or spiritual systems already understood the notion

768
00:31:02.417 --> 00:31:05.372
of multi-dimensionality, already understood healing

769
00:31:05.372 --> 00:31:09.031
by way of collapsing time-space and so forth.

770
00:31:09.031 --> 00:31:12.871
Including India's eminent religions,

771
00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:15.313
emanating out of India, out of Egypt.

772
00:31:15.313 --> 00:31:16.528
So we're really,

773
00:31:16.528 --> 00:31:18.949
how much of what we need to learn can we find

774
00:31:18.949 --> 00:31:21.435
by going, what do you call it,

775
00:31:21.435 --> 00:31:22.974
back to the future?
(laughing)

776
00:31:24.164 --> 00:31:25.862
<v ->Well, the interesting thing with science</v>

777
00:31:25.862 --> 00:31:29.264
is because it is really what the Western world look to.

778
00:31:29.264 --> 00:31:30.959
Maybe in other parts of the world

779
00:31:30.959 --> 00:31:32.304
we've got different paradigms,

780
00:31:32.304 --> 00:31:34.661
but the moment in the West, we listen to science.

781
00:31:34.661 --> 00:31:36.804
And when I go around doing my lectures

782
00:31:36.804 --> 00:31:39.236
you see that yes in the esoteric knowledge,

783
00:31:39.236 --> 00:31:41.978
but there's something about science that has a hold on us

784
00:31:41.978 --> 00:31:45.423
at the moment, and when they hear that okay,

785
00:31:45.423 --> 00:31:48.174
an angel can be a consciousness into higher dimensions

786
00:31:48.174 --> 00:31:50.617
and that's from String Theory and when people hear that

787
00:31:50.617 --> 00:31:53.134
it makes them kind of more relaxed in a way that

788
00:31:53.134 --> 00:31:55.876
they didn't even know that they needed to be.

789
00:31:55.876 --> 00:31:58.200
So it helps them on their spiritual journey

790
00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.421
to know, it's okay, there's a scientific explanation.

791
00:32:01.421 --> 00:32:05.336
So it's all out there, but there's something particularly

792
00:32:05.336 --> 00:32:07.341
delicious I think about how science has gone

793
00:32:07.341 --> 00:32:09.954
completely away from the mysticism and the old ideas

794
00:32:09.954 --> 00:32:11.554
only to come right back to them.

795
00:32:11.554 --> 00:32:13.454
(laughing)
It's quite funny.

796
00:32:13.454 --> 00:32:15.757
<v Host>I think it is, too, and you're absolutely right.</v>

797
00:32:15.757 --> 00:32:17.539
It allows people to feel safe, I mean

798
00:32:17.539 --> 00:32:19.181
your work I think is beautiful.

799
00:32:19.181 --> 00:32:21.175
Even the name, calling it Punk Science,

800
00:32:21.175 --> 00:32:24.012
first of all, how did you come up with Punk Science,

801
00:32:24.012 --> 00:32:24.919
I love it.

802
00:32:24.919 --> 00:32:26.497
<v ->Oh gosh, it was about five years ago,</v>

803
00:32:26.497 --> 00:32:29.330
and it just came out, it just came through

804
00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:31.341
and at the same time the picture on the front cover

805
00:32:31.341 --> 00:32:33.483
with the atom with a safety pin.

806
00:32:33.483 --> 00:32:34.817
(laughing)
<v Host>Yeah, I love it.</v>

807
00:32:34.817 --> 00:32:37.078
<v ->I just sort of held a vision and for a while I was like,</v>

808
00:32:37.078 --> 00:32:39.115
"Oh I have to call it something more,"

809
00:32:39.115 --> 00:32:40.619
you know, more serious.

810
00:32:40.619 --> 00:32:43.136
And it just kept coming and coming

811
00:32:43.136 --> 00:32:46.517
and I ended up having a few journeys of my own

812
00:32:46.517 --> 00:32:49.099
to go through like getting in touch with my inner punk,

813
00:32:49.099 --> 00:32:50.442
(laughing)

814
00:32:50.442 --> 00:32:52.917
and doing all that side of things

815
00:32:52.917 --> 00:32:55.179
to do the work to be comfortable with it myself

816
00:32:55.179 --> 00:32:57.760
and I'm really glad I kept with it because it's just

817
00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.360
opened doors, people love it,

818
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.341
<v Host>Oh, they do,</v>

819
00:33:00.341 --> 00:33:01.141
<v ->they respond to it.
<v Host>I love it,</v>

820
00:33:01.141 --> 00:33:02.324
(laughing)
I'm so glad you continued

821
00:33:02.324 --> 00:33:03.626
on that path, too.

822
00:33:03.626 --> 00:33:05.226
We're talking about all this,

823
00:33:05.226 --> 00:33:08.831
in one of the little sub-chapter headings you have here,

824
00:33:08.831 --> 00:33:10.869
"What you vibrate, you create,"

825
00:33:10.869 --> 00:33:13.662
and we've kind of hit on all of that but,

826
00:33:13.662 --> 00:33:16.724
you really start going into deep space with all of this,

827
00:33:16.724 --> 00:33:18.164
and you start moving toward

828
00:33:18.164 --> 00:33:19.924
the black hole principle.

829
00:33:19.924 --> 00:33:21.331
And can you,

830
00:33:21.331 --> 00:33:24.563
because we don't want to do the whole book right now.

831
00:33:24.563 --> 00:33:26.164
It would take us hours and hours

832
00:33:26.164 --> 00:33:27.924
and people will need to pick up a copy,

833
00:33:27.924 --> 00:33:31.422
but let's talk about matter, anti-matter

834
00:33:31.422 --> 00:33:33.566
and the black hole principle,

835
00:33:33.566 --> 00:33:36.083
and what the fundamental principles are at work here,

836
00:33:36.083 --> 00:33:38.365
that drive us back to this understanding.

837
00:33:38.365 --> 00:33:41.949
<v ->Well, this is really sort of the main thesis of the book.</v>

838
00:33:41.949 --> 00:33:44.189
I didn't know that when I started it, but,

839
00:33:44.189 --> 00:33:47.623
what I started to look at was cosmology,

840
00:33:47.623 --> 00:33:49.949
and the whole field of cosmology looks at

841
00:33:49.949 --> 00:33:52.529
the universe as a whole, Big Bang Theory,

842
00:33:52.529 --> 00:33:54.449
those are all parts of cosmology,

843
00:33:54.449 --> 00:33:56.166
and started to study black holes.

844
00:33:56.166 --> 00:33:59.088
And, it was when I was trying to piece all the data

845
00:33:59.088 --> 00:34:00.806
and everything together that I realized,

846
00:34:00.806 --> 00:34:02.107
hang on a minute.

847
00:34:02.107 --> 00:34:04.422
I had this massive flash,

848
00:34:04.422 --> 00:34:06.342
and I realized that,

849
00:34:06.342 --> 00:34:09.680
well it was kind of a strong vision actually,

850
00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:12.124
that black holes are actually creative.

851
00:34:12.124 --> 00:34:15.715
So what we see in our telescopes is not that black holes are

852
00:34:15.715 --> 00:34:17.155
these big guzzling machines,
<v Host>Sucks.</v>

853
00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:17.983
yeah,
(laughing)

854
00:34:17.983 --> 00:34:19.326
but what we see in our telescopes

855
00:34:19.326 --> 00:34:21.448
now that we've got the instruments to actually measure,

856
00:34:21.448 --> 00:34:24.243
is we see, black holes are actually spewing out

857
00:34:24.243 --> 00:34:26.227
loads of material at the speed of light.

858
00:34:26.227 --> 00:34:29.523
So what I'm saying in my book is actually black holes

859
00:34:29.523 --> 00:34:32.350
are not black at all, they're the source of infinite light,

860
00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:34.525
that that source is infinity,

861
00:34:34.525 --> 00:34:36.488
actually comes out, spirals out,

862
00:34:36.488 --> 00:34:38.323
gets to the edge of our reality,

863
00:34:38.323 --> 00:34:40.722
which is no longer called The Event Horizon,

864
00:34:40.722 --> 00:34:42.749
it's called the Perception Horizon,

865
00:34:42.749 --> 00:34:43.688
so that's now the edge--

866
00:34:43.688 --> 00:34:46.002
<v Host>That's a very, very big distinction.</v>

867
00:34:46.002 --> 00:34:50.457
<v ->Yeah, that's the edge of our normal conscious awareness.</v>

868
00:34:51.777 --> 00:34:54.258
So again, it's at the speed of light, but it's not to do

869
00:34:54.258 --> 00:34:56.295
with speed, it's actually to do with limitations

870
00:34:56.295 --> 00:34:58.417
of normal consciousness.

871
00:34:58.417 --> 00:35:01.212
So this is a conscious world of mass.

872
00:35:01.212 --> 00:35:04.113
So what the light does, it gets to the edge of that

873
00:35:04.113 --> 00:35:07.355
Perception Horizon, and then the light splits

874
00:35:07.355 --> 00:35:10.459
into an electron and a positron,

875
00:35:10.459 --> 00:35:12.752
and the positron goes into this anti-matter world

876
00:35:12.752 --> 00:35:14.480
which is our shadow world,

877
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.934
and the mirror world which we're not normally

878
00:35:16.934 --> 00:35:19.792
in contact with but we call it, it's in the region

879
00:35:19.792 --> 00:35:22.032
of C-squared, speed of light squared.

880
00:35:22.032 --> 00:35:24.698
And ours goes into the matter world,

881
00:35:24.698 --> 00:35:26.693
and that's the world that we see around us.

882
00:35:26.693 --> 00:35:28.175
<v Host>But let's talk about the importance</v>

883
00:35:28.175 --> 00:35:30.159
of the mirror world.
(laughing)

884
00:35:30.159 --> 00:35:32.218
The dance between the two.

885
00:35:35.348 --> 00:35:36.762
<v ->It doesn't just stop at</v>

886
00:35:36.762 --> 00:35:38.841
creating the matter and anti-matter.

887
00:35:38.841 --> 00:35:40.953
It actually goes into a dance where

888
00:35:40.953 --> 00:35:43.022
the two combine into light as well.

889
00:35:43.022 --> 00:35:46.414
But the mirror world is interesting because

890
00:35:46.414 --> 00:35:48.591
anti-matter was thought to not exist.

891
00:35:50.011 --> 00:35:51.203
People don't know where it is.

892
00:35:51.203 --> 00:35:53.838
It was supposed to have disappeared in the Big Bang.

893
00:35:53.838 --> 00:35:56.280
But actually, if you shift and realize

894
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.446
that this C-squared region, this shadow region

895
00:35:58.446 --> 00:35:59.940
was there all along.

896
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:04.003
You can see that this is the source of the divine feminine.

897
00:36:04.003 --> 00:36:06.082
And this is what's talked about

898
00:36:06.082 --> 00:36:07.682
in a lot of the ancient texts.

899
00:36:07.682 --> 00:36:11.085
And the C-squared region has the quality of negative time,

900
00:36:11.085 --> 00:36:13.837
so even things like the Gnostic gospels talk about

901
00:36:13.837 --> 00:36:16.482
the Divine Mother having forethought,

902
00:36:16.482 --> 00:36:18.818
so it's the forethought which is the time

903
00:36:18.818 --> 00:36:20.236
going the other way.

904
00:36:20.236 --> 00:36:22.583
So it's really interesting when I started to look

905
00:36:22.583 --> 00:36:25.217
and see that this mirror principle is happening,

906
00:36:25.217 --> 00:36:27.904
it's been known about for centuries.

907
00:36:27.904 --> 00:36:32.118
But what it gives us is this region that we normally call

908
00:36:32.118 --> 00:36:33.121
the aura.

909
00:36:33.121 --> 00:36:35.264
So, the black hole principle actually happens

910
00:36:35.264 --> 00:36:37.803
at every single level of the universe.

911
00:36:37.803 --> 00:36:40.384
I've put it in the book, it's too much to go into now,

912
00:36:40.384 --> 00:36:42.475
but all the evidence about the same principle

913
00:36:42.475 --> 00:36:46.261
happening in the Sun, in the planets, in comets even.

914
00:36:46.261 --> 00:36:48.800
Even in our own planet that we actually get

915
00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.741
these gamma rays created.

916
00:36:50.741 --> 00:36:52.437
And these faster than the speed of light,

917
00:36:52.437 --> 00:36:55.135
we can see them in the Earth's upper atmosphere.

918
00:36:55.135 --> 00:36:57.397
So we get them at every single level,

919
00:36:57.397 --> 00:36:59.498
and even at the level within us.

920
00:36:59.498 --> 00:37:01.194
So at the level of the chakra,

921
00:37:01.194 --> 00:37:03.615
the black hole creates,

922
00:37:03.615 --> 00:37:06.655
the matter creates our bodies,

923
00:37:06.655 --> 00:37:08.563
and the anti-matter creates our aura.

924
00:37:08.563 --> 00:37:10.996
So again, at the level of DNA

925
00:37:10.996 --> 00:37:13.278
that's all the same process going on there,

926
00:37:13.278 --> 00:37:15.078
and there's experiments to show us

927
00:37:15.078 --> 00:37:17.041
the light coming off DNA,

928
00:37:17.041 --> 00:37:20.699
as well so, it's this fractal process

929
00:37:20.699 --> 00:37:22.886
that goes all the way down to our cells,

930
00:37:22.886 --> 00:37:25.638
to our atoms, every single level.

931
00:37:25.638 --> 00:37:28.986
And it connects us all to this infinity at the center

932
00:37:28.986 --> 00:37:31.440
that's happening at every single level.

933
00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.797
We're all connected to this infinity at the center

934
00:37:33.797 --> 00:37:36.358
from our deepest atom to the biggest galaxy.

935
00:37:36.358 --> 00:37:38.106
So that's--
(laughing)

936
00:37:38.106 --> 00:37:40.901
<v Host>It's so beautiful dance, I might say.</v>

937
00:37:40.901 --> 00:37:44.101
Michio Kaku said to me he was looking for

938
00:37:44.101 --> 00:37:47.482
the Theory of Everything reduced to a one inch equation,

939
00:37:47.482 --> 00:37:50.223
can you do the Theory of Everything in a paragraph?

940
00:37:52.143 --> 00:37:53.263
(laughing)

941
00:37:53.263 --> 00:37:54.831
<v ->Infinity.
(laughing)

942
00:37:54.831 --> 00:37:57.028
It's the part that physicists don't want to,

943
00:37:57.028 --> 00:37:58.888
(laughing)
can do better than that.

944
00:37:58.888 --> 00:38:01.113
It's the part that physicists hate,

945
00:38:01.113 --> 00:38:04.835
because infinity, in fact Heisenberg himself said

946
00:38:04.835 --> 00:38:07.769
that the quantum field that we were talking about earlier,

947
00:38:07.769 --> 00:38:11.217
is actually black holes that have an infinity at the center,

948
00:38:11.217 --> 00:38:13.296
but he didn't trust his results so he ended up

949
00:38:13.296 --> 00:38:15.419
changing it to this quantum field

950
00:38:15.419 --> 00:38:17.083
that we're not familiar with.

951
00:38:17.083 --> 00:38:18.779
So, everywhere we look in physics

952
00:38:18.779 --> 00:38:20.325
we're finding infinities that people

953
00:38:20.325 --> 00:38:22.075
are trying to fudge out.

954
00:38:23.525 --> 00:38:26.148
But actually, that is the sure answer

955
00:38:26.148 --> 00:38:27.525
to the Theory of Everything.

956
00:38:27.525 --> 00:38:30.457
The infinite is actually playing a dance with itself,

957
00:38:30.457 --> 00:38:32.271
and actually pretending to be split.

958
00:38:32.271 --> 00:38:34.735
And then just going in and breathing in and out

959
00:38:34.735 --> 00:38:35.876
all the time.

960
00:38:35.876 --> 00:38:38.074
<v Host>And mirroring itself all the time.</v>

961
00:38:39.894 --> 00:38:43.044
Well, I cannot recommend highly enough that people

962
00:38:43.044 --> 00:38:45.241
pick up a copy of this book but also

963
00:38:45.241 --> 00:38:48.227
I really am setting my intention to spend

964
00:38:48.227 --> 00:38:50.222
much more time with you because we need to explore

965
00:38:50.222 --> 00:38:52.121
a lot more of this into the future.

966
00:38:52.121 --> 00:38:53.785
And thank you so much for taking the time

967
00:38:53.785 --> 00:38:55.321
to come here today.

968
00:38:55.321 --> 00:38:56.226
<v ->Oh, thank you.</v>

969
00:38:56.226 --> 00:38:57.166
<v Host>I just wish you the very best,</v>

970
00:38:57.166 --> 00:38:58.222
you've done beautiful work.

971
00:38:58.222 --> 00:38:59.636
<v ->Oh, thank you.</v>

972
00:39:01.923 --> 00:39:03.320

of Punk Science.

975
00:39:06.562 --> 00:39:08.525
This work is so important, we hope to do

976
00:39:08.525 --> 00:39:10.466
more work with Manjir in the future.

977
00:39:10.466 --> 00:39:12.183
Meanwhile, also in this month's lineup

978
00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:14.807
is David Icke, who talks about the nature of reality

979
00:39:14.807 --> 00:39:16.983
from a computer model point of view.

980
00:39:16.983 --> 00:39:18.710
You won't want to miss that interview.

981
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:20.503
Our best interview yet with David.

982
00:39:20.503 --> 00:39:22.939
Until next time, thanks for watching.
