00:00:00.771 --> 00:00:02.597
<v ->For anyone who has been through the process</v>

2
00:00:02.597 --> 00:00:05.052
of the passing of a loved one, you know that

3
00:00:05.052 --> 00:00:07.982
there are moments that are painful and trying to one's soul.

4
00:00:07.982 --> 00:00:10.955
This is especially true when it's a person's spouse

5
00:00:10.955 --> 00:00:13.536
and age has taken its toll through dementia

6
00:00:13.536 --> 00:00:16.388
and a slow or even rapid decline of health.

7
00:00:16.388 --> 00:00:19.503
Fern Stewart Welsh has walked this walk and is sharing

8
00:00:19.503 --> 00:00:22.982
her experience in her book, The Heart Knows the Way.

9
00:00:22.982 --> 00:00:25.582
This beautiful and charming woman had to dig

10
00:00:25.582 --> 00:00:27.887
down into the deepest part of her being

11
00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:30.989
to connect to the sublime part that knows all

12
00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.217
to learn about what her beloved husband was experiencing

13
00:00:34.217 --> 00:00:36.745
as his mind and body slipped away.

14
00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:39.017
What she learned will benefit each and every one

15
00:00:39.017 --> 00:00:41.655
of us that faces a loved one's decline.

16
00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:46.391 line:15% 
(soothing music playing)

17
00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:54.206
<v Voiceover>This is such a sweet and confirming</v>

18
00:00:54.206 --> 00:00:56.606
and important work that you've done.

19
00:00:56.606 --> 00:01:00.488
And just to lay a little bit of foundation here,

20
00:01:00.488 --> 00:01:03.133
certainly someone noted very well in this field,

21
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.577
Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, and you were very close friends.

22
00:01:05.577 --> 00:01:09.426
And she actually helped you through the death and dying

23
00:01:09.426 --> 00:01:12.454
and experience of your sweetie pie, Ken.

24
00:01:12.454 --> 00:01:13.338
<v ->Yes.</v>

25
00:01:13.338 --> 00:01:16.492
<v Voiceover>And so, and you are, now at this time,</v>

26
00:01:16.492 --> 00:01:18.762
carrying a lot of this work forward.

27
00:01:18.762 --> 00:01:22.849
And really, this book is sort of your flagship effort

28
00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:26.593
in helping people understand the process

29
00:01:26.593 --> 00:01:29.044
we all are going to go through at one time or another,

30
00:01:30.054 --> 00:01:33.749
short or long, in the process of death and dying.

31
00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:35.221
Can you give a little bit of background

32
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:38.006
about your relationship with Ken

33
00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:40.945
and where the beginning

34
00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:43.474
of the end actually began?

35
00:01:43.474 --> 00:01:44.992
<v ->Well, it makes me smile because one</v>

36
00:01:44.992 --> 00:01:47.125
of the greatest things that I've experienced

37
00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:49.290
as a result of going through what I did

38
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.562
is that whenever I think of my late husband,

39
00:01:51.562 --> 00:01:54.187
I don't think of it in a sad way.

40
00:01:54.187 --> 00:01:57.364
It makes me smile within, all right.

41
00:01:57.364 --> 00:01:59.753
And I guess the experience started

42
00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:02.712
about 15 years before his death in 2002.

43
00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:06.463
He started having certain illnesses,

44
00:02:06.463 --> 00:02:09.247
and it was quite awhile before I realized

45
00:02:09.247 --> 00:02:11.145
that he was not going to be able to come back

46
00:02:11.145 --> 00:02:14.879
from those illnesses, but was indeed in that process

47
00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.010
of the decline that would end in death.

48
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.717
<v ->And I guess that was probably within five, six, seven</v>

49
00:02:20.717 --> 00:02:23.996
years after he began having illnesses at different times.

50
00:02:23.996 --> 00:02:26.322
<v Voiceover>So this was a long, kind of,</v>

51
00:02:26.322 --> 00:02:29.436
in one sense, third-dimensionally downhill slide

52
00:02:29.436 --> 00:02:33.264
on a physical level, and you might even say,

53
00:02:33.264 --> 00:02:35.398
emotional or mental on some levels

54
00:02:35.398 --> 00:02:37.531
from what you understood in the beginning.

55
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:41.275
But you began, as it was becoming more challenging

56
00:02:41.275 --> 00:02:43.344
as his health was slipping away,

57
00:02:43.344 --> 00:02:46.795
you began really looking inside for answers

58
00:02:46.795 --> 00:02:48.695
and that seems like that's kind of

59
00:02:48.695 --> 00:02:50.335
where this really journey begins.

60
00:02:50.335 --> 00:02:51.509
Can you talk about that?

61
00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:55.118
<v ->Yes, it's called sheer desperation, absolute desperation.</v>

62
00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:58.423
I wanted to approach this with my husband,

63
00:02:58.423 --> 00:03:00.396
who I loved dearly.

64
00:03:00.396 --> 00:03:03.041
I wanted to approach this in a way that was more helpful,

65
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:07.916
more enlightening, and more loving, and I tried.

66
00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:11.915
For about four or five years, I was totally unsuccessful

67
00:03:11.915 --> 00:03:14.958
and what I was doing was using just my sheer energy

68
00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.124
and force of will, and I was becoming exhausted.

69
00:03:19.104 --> 00:03:21.272
I didn't recuperate from even a light cold

70
00:03:21.272 --> 00:03:23.447
or something like that very easily.

71
00:03:23.447 --> 00:03:26.721
So I did what I guess what millions of people do

72
00:03:26.721 --> 00:03:28.652
when they come to a point like this.

73
00:03:28.652 --> 00:03:31.574
I went within, and I was determined

74
00:03:31.574 --> 00:03:34.924
that I would either have that connection with the

75
00:03:34.924 --> 00:03:38.145
eternal and sublime something that's within everyone,

76
00:03:38.145 --> 00:03:41.538
or I would know the reason why not.

77
00:03:41.538 --> 00:03:44.118
And so I devoted my life to that.

78
00:03:44.118 --> 00:03:46.544
<v Voiceover>How did you go about doing this?</v>

79
00:03:46.544 --> 00:03:49.269
How did that process work for you?

80
00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.138
<v ->Well, I had been a journaler all my life,</v>

81
00:03:52.138 --> 00:03:55.998
well most of my life, anyway about 40 years, daily.

82
00:03:55.998 --> 00:03:59.475
That had continued during this time with my husband,

83
00:03:59.475 --> 00:04:01.802
and I used that, I would write out

84
00:04:01.802 --> 00:04:04.424
all my cares and my concerns and pray.

85
00:04:04.424 --> 00:04:07.186
And then I did what I have done most of my life.

86
00:04:07.186 --> 00:04:08.998
When nothing happened, no burning bush,

87
00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:10.737
no immediate, whatever,

88
00:04:10.737 --> 00:04:13.693
I went out and tried to do it myself.

89
00:04:13.693 --> 00:04:15.965
And this time, I was determined

90
00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:17.778
that that wasn't going to be the case,

91
00:04:17.778 --> 00:04:21.074
and so day by day, I went within, I prayed,

92
00:04:22.104 --> 00:04:23.976
and the process was such that the more

93
00:04:23.976 --> 00:04:27.879
that I went within, the more content I became

94
00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:30.416
at being in meditation and in prayer

95
00:04:31.416 --> 00:04:33.735
and being within myself because prior to this,

96
00:04:33.735 --> 00:04:35.921
I had been working, I retired.

97
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:38.491
And when I did retire, I had time.

98
00:04:38.491 --> 00:04:40.795
and didn't have to look at the clock

99
00:04:40.795 --> 00:04:43.654
and be concerned about how much time I spent.

100
00:04:43.654 --> 00:04:46.246
So sometimes, I would spend an hour or two.

101
00:04:46.246 --> 00:04:48.571
I would say prayers for me, for my family,

102
00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:52.123
for the world, for the Earth, and I would cry,

103
00:04:52.123 --> 00:04:56.509
and I would do all sorts of beseeching type things,

104
00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.253
and just continued day after day after day.

105
00:05:02.293 --> 00:05:03.781
The more desperate the situation got,

106
00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:07.383
when I could see that Ken was losing awareness of his life.

107
00:05:08.417 --> 00:05:11.285
And everything around him, then I really spent

108
00:05:11.285 --> 00:05:14.793
the time there, and my daughter suggested a book to me

109
00:05:14.793 --> 00:05:18.133
called Secrets of the Vine and I read it.

110
00:05:18.133 --> 00:05:19.650
And what I discovered was that

111
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.539
it's certainly a different process than what I was doing.

112
00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:26.753
Instead of crying and begging and pleading, it indicated

113
00:05:26.753 --> 00:05:29.986
that I was to spend that time as I would

114
00:05:29.986 --> 00:05:33.348
with a very dear friend, getting to know that dear friend,

115
00:05:34.418 --> 00:05:37.561
you know, sharing all of my concerns, my desires

116
00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:39.374
with my loves, my everything.

117
00:05:39.374 --> 00:05:42.019
And literally, that's what I focused on.

118
00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:44.711
And then one day, I wrote out, you know,

119
00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:47.981
I want a personal relationship with you God.

120
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:49.657
I don't know how to do it.

121
00:05:49.657 --> 00:05:51.650
How does a little person like myself

122
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.392
have a personal relationship with the God

123
00:05:54.392 --> 00:05:56.578
of the universe, the allness of the universe?

124
00:05:56.578 --> 00:05:59.476
And innocently, within my brain

125
00:05:59.476 --> 00:06:02.274
and I think my heart too, came that message.

126
00:06:02.274 --> 00:06:04.743
Fern, Fern, Fern, I'm going to cry.

127
00:06:04.743 --> 00:06:06.594
You have always had it.

128
00:06:06.594 --> 00:06:09.232
<v Voiceover>Right, it's always been there.</v>

129
00:06:09.232 --> 00:06:10.448
<v ->It's always been there.</v>

130
00:06:10.448 --> 00:06:12.325
<v Voiceover>Now while this was happening,</v>

131
00:06:12.325 --> 00:06:14.968
Ken was going through some pretty dramatic stuff.

132
00:06:16.198 --> 00:06:18.978
He had, at one point, finally had to go

133
00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:22.584
into a facility where he had assisted living

134
00:06:22.584 --> 00:06:24.770
because his problems were becoming

135
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.415
too challenging for you to deal with.

136
00:06:27.415 --> 00:06:28.370
<v ->Right.</v>

137
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.039
<v Voiceover>In addition, there were a lot</v>

138
00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:32.215
of emotional challenges, and some of them

139
00:06:32.215 --> 00:06:35.079
were almost comical in reading your book.

140
00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:36.918
It's not funny when you're that person.

141
00:06:36.918 --> 00:06:37.811
<v ->No.</v>

142
00:06:37.811 --> 00:06:39.729
<v Voiceover>To see your husband, you know,</v>

143
00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:41.937
asking you to make wedding arrangements

144
00:06:41.937 --> 00:06:44.788
with the 21 year-old nurse (laughs).

145
00:06:44.788 --> 00:06:45.756
<v ->Right.</v>

146
00:06:45.756 --> 00:06:47.783
<v Voiceover>Because he knows you know him well.</v>

147
00:06:47.783 --> 00:06:50.847
And these moments that one would say are not

148
00:06:50.847 --> 00:06:53.843
particularly lucid, but that are there all the time.

149
00:06:54.883 --> 00:06:58.818
And so, what was happening on an emotional level

150
00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:02.786
in you as you were dealing with these bizarre sorts

151
00:07:02.786 --> 00:07:05.975
of encounters with your husband on a regular basis?

152
00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:07.802
<v ->First of all, it was devastating</v>

153
00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:11.254
because I could not believe that this man who adored me

154
00:07:11.254 --> 00:07:14.753
and who I adored would be going

155
00:07:14.753 --> 00:07:17.441
through this kind of experience.

156
00:07:17.441 --> 00:07:20.450
That sent me running back to communion with God

157
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.423
with that eternal and sublime something

158
00:07:22.423 --> 00:07:24.929
that's within you, me, and everyone.

159
00:07:24.929 --> 00:07:27.936
And that's when I was told, if he finds solace

160
00:07:29.326 --> 00:07:32.373
in any relationship or imagined relationship,

161
00:07:32.373 --> 00:07:35.115
because every soul likes that companionship,

162
00:07:35.115 --> 00:07:37.461
that feeling of human companionship,

163
00:07:37.461 --> 00:07:39.776
you must allow it and it will not harm you

164
00:07:39.776 --> 00:07:41.749
in any way, shape, or form.

165
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:44.287
<v Voiceover>So initially, the ego might hear this.</v>

166
00:07:44.287 --> 00:07:45.909
What happens there?

167
00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:49.675
<v ->The ego was devastated.</v>

168
00:07:49.675 --> 00:07:52.895
I could not believe that this was going on,

169
00:07:52.895 --> 00:07:56.031
that he could forget me, and could forget

170
00:07:56.031 --> 00:07:59.937
our relationship, and I did have a real problem with that.

171
00:07:59.937 --> 00:08:02.305
It took me quite awhile to be able to deal with that.

172
00:08:02.305 --> 00:08:05.163
And that went on off-and-on for almost a year.

173
00:08:05.163 --> 00:08:08.598
<v Voiceover>Right, and so, ultimately,</v>

174
00:08:08.598 --> 00:08:11.039
you started getting this clear connection.

175
00:08:12.003 --> 00:08:14.729
with the force (laughs),

176
00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:17.746
the grand force within that permeates all.

177
00:08:17.746 --> 00:08:18.514
<v ->Right.</v>

178
00:08:18.514 --> 00:08:21.043
<v Voiceover>And you started getting very clear messages.</v>

179
00:08:21.043 --> 00:08:21.810
<v ->Yes.</v>

180
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.317
<v Voiceover>So how did these messages start out?</v>

181
00:08:24.317 --> 00:08:26.226
They were more simple in the beginning,

182
00:08:26.226 --> 00:08:30.450
but they really became quite detailed and refined

183
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.263
in the knowledge that was passed through to you.

184
00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:35.122
<v Voiceover>So how did they begin?</v>

185
00:08:35.122 --> 00:08:36.508
Where did your relationship then

186
00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:40.849
with the sublime force begin and take you from there

187
00:08:40.849 --> 00:08:43.375
with all this other stuff in the backdrop, you know,

188
00:08:43.375 --> 00:08:46.516
just hurting you on an ego and feelings level everyday?

189
00:08:47.456 --> 00:08:50.873
<v ->Well, I think gradually, I was becoming</v>

190
00:08:50.873 --> 00:08:53.996
more fine-tuned to this relationship.

191
00:08:54.906 --> 00:08:56.188
I will be honest with you.

192
00:08:56.188 --> 00:08:58.681
From the very first, I trusted it implicitly.

193
00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:00.679
It felt so right, it felt wonderful.

194
00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:03.675
As I said in the book, it felt like

195
00:09:03.675 --> 00:09:06.160
it was my natural state of being.

196
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.739
So even though I thought other people

197
00:09:07.739 --> 00:09:09.937
might question it, I didn't.

198
00:09:09.937 --> 00:09:10.837
<v Voiceover>Right.</v>

199
00:09:10.837 --> 00:09:14.330
<v ->Because it was totally, totally right and totally good.</v>

200
00:09:15.754 --> 00:09:18.671
I think that being fine-tuned meant that,

201
00:09:18.671 --> 00:09:21.391
number one, I was more relaxed when I was in that.

202
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:23.088
I wasn't so desperate, and I hope

203
00:09:23.088 --> 00:09:24.826
I'm answering your question.

204
00:09:24.826 --> 00:09:28.361
I was not so desperate so I could ask

205
00:09:28.361 --> 00:09:30.212
more detailed questions.

206
00:09:30.212 --> 00:09:33.257
I could accept the answers

207
00:09:33.257 --> 00:09:36.114
and accept the guidance.

208
00:09:37.094 --> 00:09:41.614
I did absolutely everything that I was asked to do,

209
00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:44.216
and at some point within me, I was able

210
00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:47.479
to come to peace with these things that

211
00:09:47.479 --> 00:09:50.349
otherwise, I don't know what I would have done.

212
00:09:50.349 --> 00:09:51.831
<v Voiceover>I'd like to talk to you about some</v>

213
00:09:51.831 --> 00:09:54.595
of those things because I think most everybody out here

214
00:09:54.595 --> 00:09:56.546
is going to go through, hold someone's hand

215
00:09:56.546 --> 00:09:58.870
through this kind of process and certainly if not,

216
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.150
they're certainly going to go through it

217
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.793
on some level themselves.

218
00:10:01.793 --> 00:10:05.122
I mean, if you're young and you die quickly

219
00:10:05.122 --> 00:10:07.808
in a car accident, it's a very much quicker transition

220
00:10:07.808 --> 00:10:10.048
than what Ken had.

221
00:10:10.048 --> 00:10:10.982
<v ->Right.</v>

222
00:10:10.982 --> 00:10:12.854
<v Voiceover>Ken's was a very lengthy transition.</v>

223
00:10:13.814 --> 00:10:16.576
What kind of guidance did you get, for example,

224
00:10:18.316 --> 00:10:20.400
when you were given the guidance

225
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.933
regarding his behavior beyond needing

226
00:10:22.933 --> 00:10:24.565
the solace and companionship

227
00:10:24.565 --> 00:10:26.267
because there were times when he was quite lucid.

228
00:10:26.267 --> 00:10:26.998
<v ->Yes.</v>

229
00:10:26.998 --> 00:10:28.395
<v Voiceover>And there were other times</v>

230
00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:29.814
when he wasn't there at all.

231
00:10:29.814 --> 00:10:31.316
Can you give us some real specifics

232
00:10:31.316 --> 00:10:33.450
about what you were told, about what a person's

233
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.476
going through in these kinds of,

234
00:10:36.556 --> 00:10:39.424
under these conditions with this kind of behavior?

235
00:10:39.424 --> 00:10:40.905
<v ->I'll try and if this isn't exactly</v>

236
00:10:40.905 --> 00:10:43.284
what you're asking, let me know.

237
00:10:43.284 --> 00:10:46.761
One of the things that helped me a lot was understanding,

238
00:10:47.841 --> 00:10:50.217
at a certain point, through these messages,

239
00:10:51.307 --> 00:10:53.350
what my Ken was going through, which was

240
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:57.158
that when he was lucid, he was in this dimension.

241
00:10:57.158 --> 00:10:59.877
When he was not lucid, he was in the next dimension,

242
00:10:59.877 --> 00:11:02.045
which we called death, okay?

243
00:11:02.045 --> 00:11:03.889
And so he was gong back and forth

244
00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:05.210
between those two dimensions.

245
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:09.018
And one of my primary desires, it was a heart desire,

246
00:11:09.018 --> 00:11:11.418
was to maintain our bond of love,

247
00:11:11.418 --> 00:11:14.501
our connection of love of no matter what it looked like

248
00:11:14.501 --> 00:11:17.748
on the surface, externally to me or to other people,

249
00:11:17.748 --> 00:11:19.718
and that, I believe, I was able to do.

250
00:11:20.808 --> 00:11:22.558
And I was able to do that only

251
00:11:22.558 --> 00:11:25.299
with the guidance that I had and with being told,

252
00:11:25.299 --> 00:11:27.424
you know, to watch his eyes, for instance,

253
00:11:27.424 --> 00:11:29.598
because then I could tell when he was,

254
00:11:29.598 --> 00:11:33.562
even though he may not react to me as he would normally,

255
00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:37.290
he did seem to know my energy, at least.

256
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.232
So I could tell when he was there and when he was here,

257
00:11:40.232 --> 00:11:42.056
when he was lucid in front of me.

258
00:11:42.056 --> 00:11:45.224
And he became very facile near the end

259
00:11:45.224 --> 00:11:48.167
of his life with being able to go back and forth.

260
00:11:48.167 --> 00:11:50.439
And it was really fascinating because he had been

261
00:11:50.439 --> 00:11:54.492
the type of man who was very fun-loving (laughs),

262
00:11:55.522 --> 00:11:58.108
and he teased a lot, and so instead of saying,

263
00:11:58.108 --> 00:12:00.732
"Oh, you look wonderful today," he would say,

264
00:12:00.732 --> 00:12:03.253
"For a fat girl, you clean up pretty good."

265
00:12:03.253 --> 00:12:04.528
You know, things like that.

266
00:12:04.528 --> 00:12:06.652
So one day I'm with him and in this interchange,

267
00:12:06.652 --> 00:12:09.436
he comes back and I can tell that he's there

268
00:12:09.436 --> 00:12:12.647
with me totally, and he says, "When I feel the love

269
00:12:12.647 --> 00:12:15.632
"coming from you, it makes me want to return it."

270
00:12:16.582 --> 00:12:18.864
And that was absolutely incredible

271
00:12:18.864 --> 00:12:21.742
because he had not been that kind of man

272
00:12:21.742 --> 00:12:24.356
who would express his emotions in that way.

273
00:12:25.523 --> 00:12:29.147
So I think that as I was being fine-tuned,

274
00:12:29.147 --> 00:12:31.526
is about the best way I can express it.

275
00:12:31.526 --> 00:12:34.463
As I was being fine-tuned in this energy,

276
00:12:34.463 --> 00:12:35.887
I was able to bring more of it out

277
00:12:37.057 --> 00:12:39.876
to my associations and interactions with Ken.

278
00:12:41.046 --> 00:12:44.590
I became able to accept what was going on,

279
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.280
and try to stay out of the way with my ego

280
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.392
and stay out of the way with what my desires were

281
00:12:50.392 --> 00:12:54.200
and just help this soul make his journey

282
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.613
in his soul's time and make his transition.

283
00:12:58.583 --> 00:13:01.144
<v Voiceover>What also was interesting was that,</v>

284
00:13:01.144 --> 00:13:04.375
because he was going between dimensions

285
00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:08.364
and going to the other side, he was able

286
00:13:08.364 --> 00:13:12.215
to dip into sources of love and understanding

287
00:13:12.215 --> 00:13:14.637
in such that, he may not have had access to

288
00:13:14.637 --> 00:13:17.576
within himself in his third dimesional life.

289
00:13:17.576 --> 00:13:18.422
<v ->Right.</v>

290
00:13:18.422 --> 00:13:20.160
<v Voiceover>Is it a two-way street then,</v>

291
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.686
bringing the love both ways?

292
00:13:21.686 --> 00:13:24.086
You committed to giving it, and he was

293
00:13:24.086 --> 00:13:26.038
already experiencing some over there.

294
00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:29.071
How did this work between you then,

295
00:13:29.071 --> 00:13:32.182
on a soul-level from what your guidance was telling you

296
00:13:32.182 --> 00:13:34.516
about the flowing of love back-and-forth

297
00:13:34.516 --> 00:13:36.385
from his comings and goings?

298
00:13:36.385 --> 00:13:39.040
<v ->I can remember that as he became more facile</v>

299
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:44.101
as he became more facile on these journeys,

300
00:13:44.101 --> 00:13:47.114
and that he was mirroring me, my love.

301
00:13:47.114 --> 00:13:48.686
We mirroed each other.

302
00:13:48.686 --> 00:13:51.990
That's about the best way I can answer that.

303
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.256
And I don't know, I had no indication

304
00:13:56.256 --> 00:14:00.110
that he had, from verbally, that he had a new understanding.

305
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.242
What he brought back was love

306
00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:07.000
and it was indicative in that one thing that he said

307
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.238
and a couple of others, and I don't remember

308
00:14:08.238 --> 00:14:10.059
the others right now.

309
00:14:10.059 --> 00:14:12.739
But mainly, from the way,

310
00:14:12.739 --> 00:14:14.925
he became soft, he became,

311
00:14:14.925 --> 00:14:17.122
he had been a very powerful businessman,

312
00:14:17.122 --> 00:14:19.446
and a very in-control businessman,

313
00:14:19.446 --> 00:14:22.103
and yet he became very soft.

314
00:14:22.103 --> 00:14:23.469
I mean he was always tender and loving

315
00:14:23.469 --> 00:14:27.320
to me and to family, but he also had a very strong side

316
00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.250
in order to operate in the corporate world.

317
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.612
So he became very soft and very tender,

318
00:14:33.612 --> 00:14:35.468
and very child-like.

319
00:14:36.492 --> 00:14:39.414
And those are the major things that I noticed.

320
00:14:40.364 --> 00:14:42.762
<v Voiceover>Back to his more essential nature.</v>

321
00:14:42.762 --> 00:14:44.007
<v ->Right.</v>

322
00:14:44.007 --> 00:14:46.351
<v Voiceover>So when the time started drawing near</v>

323
00:14:47.371 --> 00:14:50.326
toward the very last couple of days of his life,

324
00:14:50.326 --> 00:14:52.118
what kind of information was flowing

325
00:14:52.118 --> 00:14:54.027
through, at that time, for you?

326
00:14:54.027 --> 00:14:57.440
<v ->Persevere, persevere, persevere.</v>

327
00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.516
You will be victorious, everything that you have experienced

328
00:15:00.516 --> 00:15:03.168
in your life has brought you to this point.

329
00:15:05.802 --> 00:15:07.466
<v Voiceover>Can you expand on that a little bit</v>

330
00:15:07.466 --> 00:15:10.644
to this point, why this point for each one

331
00:15:10.644 --> 00:15:14.670
of us to deal with this situation?

332
00:15:16.522 --> 00:15:19.209
<v ->Maybe I'm thinking about, now that you ask a question,</v>

333
00:15:19.209 --> 00:15:21.950
I'm thinking about the fact that when this all started,

334
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:25.437
I thought, "Will I be enough?

335
00:15:26.437 --> 00:15:27.918
"Will I be able to do this in a way

336
00:15:27.918 --> 00:15:29.475
"that my heart and soul desires?

337
00:15:29.475 --> 00:15:31.283
"Will I be able to do it in a helpful,

338
00:15:31.283 --> 00:15:34.078
"life-affirming, spiritually-affirming way?"

339
00:15:35.278 --> 00:15:38.281
And I guess that was my concern all the way through.

340
00:15:38.281 --> 00:15:41.320
And I think what was meant by that guidance was

341
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.914
that, at this point, I was ready to take it all the way

342
00:15:44.914 --> 00:15:46.493
and should have no fear about that.

343
00:15:47.683 --> 00:15:48.952
<v Voiceover>And there really are just some</v>

344
00:15:48.952 --> 00:15:50.916
beautiful pearls of wisdom in there for each

345
00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:53.904
of these little, daily situations that were painful

346
00:15:53.904 --> 00:15:56.132
that you encountered to help you through there.

347
00:15:56.132 --> 00:15:57.910
I mean, I highly recommend anybody

348
00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:02.873
that's going into this kind of stage with somebody.

349
00:16:02.873 --> 00:16:05.956
It's a wonderful, gentle kind of guidebook for them

350
00:16:05.956 --> 00:16:08.558
to help them understand from the other perspective

351
00:16:08.558 --> 00:16:11.654
and not just their own fears, and as you say, pains,

352
00:16:11.654 --> 00:16:15.312
and you know, little whiplashes of the ego and so forth.

353
00:16:16.262 --> 00:16:18.213
<v ->I think one of the things I would like to stress is</v>

354
00:16:18.213 --> 00:16:21.462
that it's possible, number one,

355
00:16:21.462 --> 00:16:24.299
for a person, an ordinary person

356
00:16:24.299 --> 00:16:28.085
to accompany a loved one in a way that is life-affirming

357
00:16:28.085 --> 00:16:31.279
and is helpful and is loving, and I think

358
00:16:31.279 --> 00:16:35.652
that's very important, and I can say that because I did it.

359
00:16:35.652 --> 00:16:38.625
And I know that if I did it, anybody else can.

360
00:16:38.625 --> 00:16:40.183
<v Voiceover>And what effect did it have</v>

361
00:16:40.183 --> 00:16:43.822
after Ken made his transition and you were going

362
00:16:43.822 --> 00:16:46.959
through the normal process people go through?

363
00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:49.347
What was different in what you experienced

364
00:16:49.347 --> 00:16:51.161
versus maybe somebody who hadn't been able

365
00:16:51.161 --> 00:16:54.318
to go through it with that kind of knowledge and grace?

366
00:16:55.288 --> 00:16:57.359
<v ->Immediately, I don't think there was any difference.</v>

367
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.931
I did 60 days of mourning

368
00:17:00.931 --> 00:17:03.869
and I gave myself to the process totally.

369
00:17:03.869 --> 00:17:07.736
I lived, ate, slept, thought, you know, cried,

370
00:17:07.736 --> 00:17:09.557
did all the things that any human

371
00:17:09.557 --> 00:17:12.546
being would do that loves someone.

372
00:17:12.546 --> 00:17:16.015
After the 60 days, Mrs. Kubler-Ross called me,

373
00:17:16.015 --> 00:17:19.056
and said, "Fern, have you finished your book?"

374
00:17:19.056 --> 00:17:22.233
And I said, "No," I'm crying.

375
00:17:22.233 --> 00:17:23.833
And she said, "You must finish it,"

376
00:17:23.833 --> 00:17:25.295
because she had read the book,

377
00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:28.036
the manuscript before it was complete.

378
00:17:28.036 --> 00:17:30.425
And so she encouraged me to continue it.

379
00:17:31.413 --> 00:17:33.561
And that caused me to go to the computer,

380
00:17:33.561 --> 00:17:36.515
and to look at the book that I had been writing

381
00:17:36.515 --> 00:17:39.086
to chronicle my husband's death and dying,

382
00:17:39.086 --> 00:17:42.182
and that seemed to be

383
00:17:44.616 --> 00:17:47.630
a positive step in me working through it

384
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.310
because writing to me is a catharsis.

385
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.162
It's a natural healing process.

386
00:17:52.162 --> 00:17:54.625
I've done that all my life, so I think

387
00:17:54.625 --> 00:17:56.428
that started me on the next stage,

388
00:17:56.428 --> 00:18:00.891
which is finishing that book and I have not looked back.

389
00:18:00.891 --> 00:18:04.214
I found myself soon filled with joy

390
00:18:04.214 --> 00:18:06.486
with boundless enthusiasm for life,

391
00:18:07.446 --> 00:18:10.102
knowing that there is a way to go through that.

392
00:18:10.102 --> 00:18:12.050
That is diametrically opposed to

393
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.367
what many people experience.

394
00:18:14.367 --> 00:18:16.683
Death isn't the most horrible thing in the world.

395
00:18:16.683 --> 00:18:20.336
It's meant to be a sacred, life-affirming,

396
00:18:20.336 --> 00:18:21.719
spiritually-enlightening event,

397
00:18:21.719 --> 00:18:23.196
and that's what I experienced,

398
00:18:23.196 --> 00:18:25.585
that's what I'm going to take out to the world.

399
00:18:28.987 --> 00:18:30.495
<v ->If you enjoyed this interview,</v>

400
00:18:30.495 --> 00:18:32.512
you can learn her entire story by picking up

401
00:18:32.512 --> 00:18:34.654
a copy of The Heart Knows the Way.

402
00:18:34.654 --> 00:18:36.254
It's a wonderful, how-to guide

403
00:18:36.254 --> 00:18:38.979
in assisting someone to the other side.

404
00:18:38.979 --> 00:18:41.172
Meanwhile, other interviews you might like are

405
00:18:41.172 --> 00:18:43.006
Dannion Brinkley and Mitchel Gibson,

406
00:18:43.006 --> 00:18:46.297
who also speak to life beyond this dimension.

407
00:18:46.297 --> 00:18:48.308
Until next time, thanks for watching.

408
00:18:48.308 --> 00:18:53.235
