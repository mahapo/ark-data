00:00:00.448 --> 00:00:02.828
<v ->Claude Swanson didn't find what he was looking for</v>

2
00:00:02.828 --> 00:00:04.468
as he worked his way through his bachelor

3
00:00:04.468 --> 00:00:07.288
of science and physics at MIT and later,

4
00:00:07.288 --> 00:00:09.708
his doctorate in physics at Princeton.

5
00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:11.168
There were simply too many questions

6
00:00:11.168 --> 00:00:14.428
regarding energy dynamics, paranormal experience,

7
00:00:14.428 --> 00:00:16.708
and more that could not be addressed through

8
00:00:16.708 --> 00:00:18.748
the standard scientific model.

9
00:00:18.748 --> 00:00:21.688
He began looking to ancient cycles of consciousness

10
00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:24.248
and the science of remote viewing to prove

11
00:00:24.248 --> 00:00:26.048
that we can indeed bridge the worlds

12
00:00:26.048 --> 00:00:28.168
of science and spirituality.

13
00:00:28.168 --> 00:00:30.048
Claude says that some of what we now call

14
00:00:30.048 --> 00:00:33.148
the new sciences, in fact, closely resemble

15
00:00:33.148 --> 00:00:36.738
what was once referred to in ancient cultures as magic.

16
00:00:45.228 --> 00:00:47.948
You talked about a Hopi glyph in which

17
00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:51.968
the western man is separated, his head is separated

18
00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:53.208
from his body.

19
00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:55.908
Can you make comment on what that means?

20
00:00:55.908 --> 00:00:58.348
It's kind of obvious, but your comments?

21
00:00:58.348 --> 00:01:01.508
<v ->Well the Hopi interpretation of that is that</v>

22
00:01:01.508 --> 00:01:06.388
the body basically represents our physical relationship

23
00:01:06.388 --> 00:01:09.708
to the world, the things we create that are physical.

24
00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:13.708
The head is the wisdom, and basically the head

25
00:01:13.708 --> 00:01:15.208
and the body are not communicating.

26
00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:17.488
So the wisdom is not really communicating

27
00:01:17.488 --> 00:01:19.888
with what we're doing physically in the world,

28
00:01:19.888 --> 00:01:23.028
and their interpretation really is that we're not open

29
00:01:23.028 --> 00:01:26.408
to the spiritual wisdom that we really need

30
00:01:26.408 --> 00:01:29.308
for guidance in making wise decisions.

31
00:01:29.308 --> 00:01:32.048
So we're kind of going along in automatic mode

32
00:01:32.048 --> 00:01:34.668
making what we call rational decisions

33
00:01:34.668 --> 00:01:36.608
without listening to spirit.

34
00:01:36.608 --> 00:01:41.608
What they show in their timeline is several catastrophes,

35
00:01:42.108 --> 00:01:45.288
World War one and two, and a future World War three,

36
00:01:45.288 --> 00:01:48.828
basically some very rough things ahead

37
00:01:48.828 --> 00:01:51.568
if we don't wake up and make that reconnection

38
00:01:51.568 --> 00:01:55.728
between the physical body and the spiritual wisdom.

39
00:01:55.728 --> 00:01:57.548
So that's where we are right now,

40
00:01:57.548 --> 00:02:00.068
and you can look at the environment around

41
00:02:00.068 --> 00:02:03.088
and see all these things that are going on if we don't,

42
00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:05.108
you know global warming and everything else.

43
00:02:05.108 --> 00:02:07.128
So we need to wake up.

44
00:02:07.128 --> 00:02:07.888
That's what they're saying.

45
00:02:07.888 --> 00:02:08.788
<v Interviewer>And that's what conferences</v>

46
00:02:08.788 --> 00:02:09.348
like these are about,

47
00:02:09.348 --> 00:02:11.228
and this is a particularly exceptional one.

48
00:02:11.228 --> 00:02:13.208
And what I find is just the change from

49
00:02:13.208 --> 00:02:15.768
last year's conference to this is there is

50
00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:19.248
a big bump up in linking consciousness

51
00:02:19.248 --> 00:02:22.448
and spiritual elements of life to science,

52
00:02:22.448 --> 00:02:25.368
even more so than last year by quite a bit,

53
00:02:25.368 --> 00:02:27.608
and it's interesting because you are very

54
00:02:27.608 --> 00:02:29.588
heavily credentialed in the sciences.

55
00:02:29.588 --> 00:02:32.468
I mean MIT, but I heard you comment that

56
00:02:32.468 --> 00:02:35.068
the information was too limited.

57
00:02:35.068 --> 00:02:40.068
<v ->Yeah, there's a real sense in the way we do science.</v>

58
00:02:40.808 --> 00:02:43.828
It's part of the problem.

59
00:02:43.828 --> 00:02:48.828
That our educational system tends to encourage

60
00:02:49.608 --> 00:02:53.108
and reward conformity in thinking.

61
00:02:53.108 --> 00:02:56.488
The students that are really good at memorizing,

62
00:02:56.488 --> 00:02:59.048
learning the rules, doing the calculations

63
00:02:59.048 --> 00:03:01.648
the way they were told, and kind of spitting it back,

64
00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:03.728
you do well in school, get a good grade,

65
00:03:03.728 --> 00:03:05.468
and you move up the ladder and

66
00:03:05.468 --> 00:03:07.148
become the professor some day.

67
00:03:07.148 --> 00:03:10.428
Which does not really encourage original thinking.

68
00:03:10.428 --> 00:03:14.588
And I think in the past, when things weren't so organized,

69
00:03:14.588 --> 00:03:17.728
there was probably more openness, more availability

70
00:03:17.728 --> 00:03:19.328
for really creative thinking.

71
00:03:19.328 --> 00:03:21.468
I mean Einstein was working in the patent office

72
00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:23.868
when he came up with his great theories.

73
00:03:23.868 --> 00:03:28.368
So I think there's kind of a factory mentality maybe

74
00:03:28.368 --> 00:03:31.788
in our current science so that a lot of the people

75
00:03:31.788 --> 00:03:36.788
who are doing science probably have forgotten

76
00:03:37.308 --> 00:03:41.648
what it feels like, when you're on the forefront,

77
00:03:41.648 --> 00:03:45.208
you're not getting confirmation.

78
00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:47.668
You don't have that warm fuzzy from your colleagues.

79
00:03:47.668 --> 00:03:48.208
<v Interviewer>That's right.</v>

80
00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:50.508
<v ->You're out there in the cold by yourself.</v>

81
00:03:50.508 --> 00:03:52.408
And that's really what it's gonna take

82
00:03:52.408 --> 00:03:53.708
to shift the paradigm.

83
00:03:53.708 --> 00:03:55.508
<v Interviewer>Right, right.</v>

84
00:03:55.508 --> 00:03:57.568
And you really have done some groundbreaking work

85
00:03:57.568 --> 00:03:59.868
because you've jumped from one side

86
00:03:59.868 --> 00:04:01.089
back to the other and back.

87
00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:03.548
You've really seemed to be able to traverse

88
00:04:03.548 --> 00:04:04.768
those worlds really well,

89
00:04:04.768 --> 00:04:08.808
and you've even done training in remote viewing

90
00:04:08.808 --> 00:04:10.748
and you've very successfully done this yourself.

91
00:04:10.748 --> 00:04:12.488
And this gets into some of the awakenings

92
00:04:12.488 --> 00:04:14.308
of potential we're talking about.

93
00:04:14.308 --> 00:04:15.328
Do you want to comment on that

94
00:04:15.328 --> 00:04:17.248
and you can take as much time as you like.

95
00:04:17.248 --> 00:04:20.088
<v ->Well I got into science in the first place</v>

96
00:04:20.088 --> 00:04:21.848
because of curiosity.

97
00:04:21.848 --> 00:04:25.048
I wanted to understand how the universe works.

98
00:04:25.048 --> 00:04:26.448
That's what got me in.

99
00:04:26.448 --> 00:04:30.548
So I didn't want to take any easy superficial answers.

100
00:04:30.548 --> 00:04:33.008
I wanted to have a feeling that what I understood

101
00:04:33.008 --> 00:04:36.588
was the truth, and that's what I was looking for in science.

102
00:04:36.588 --> 00:04:39.228
And so when you have that attitude,

103
00:04:39.228 --> 00:04:41.128
you can kind of get a sense sometimes

104
00:04:41.128 --> 00:04:42.908
when the answer is facile.

105
00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:46.588
If someone does an experiment and then afterwards,

106
00:04:46.588 --> 00:04:48.708
they cobble together a mathematical theory

107
00:04:48.708 --> 00:04:51.129
that'll give the results of that experiment,

108
00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:53.508
that's not really an explanation.

109
00:04:53.508 --> 00:04:56.928
We can always do curve fitting and explain things that way,

110
00:04:56.928 --> 00:04:59.128
but it's not a deep understanding.

111
00:04:59.128 --> 00:05:01.488
One thing that made Einstein...

112
00:05:01.488 --> 00:05:02.668
<v Interviewer>The complexity's missing.</v>

113
00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:04.728
<v ->Yeah and that intuition.</v>

114
00:05:04.728 --> 00:05:06.768
I mean one thing that made Einstein so special

115
00:05:06.768 --> 00:05:10.968
is he had one or two core deep principles

116
00:05:10.968 --> 00:05:15.968
that he thought of, like in spatial relativity.

117
00:05:16.188 --> 00:05:19.228
The idea was light is always constant in

118
00:05:19.228 --> 00:05:21.428
the frame of motion which you're in.

119
00:05:21.428 --> 00:05:24.408
And there's no way to tell which frame is special.

120
00:05:24.408 --> 00:05:26.548
They're all equal in a way.

121
00:05:26.548 --> 00:05:29.228
And now we're kind of learning, 100 years later,

122
00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:30.968
that maybe that's not quite right,

123
00:05:30.968 --> 00:05:34.468
that maybe there is an ether and maybe relativity's

124
00:05:34.468 --> 00:05:36.108
not quite as right as we thought,

125
00:05:36.108 --> 00:05:38.608
but it worked very well in a lot of ways,

126
00:05:38.608 --> 00:05:41.328
and it was basically two intuitive ideas

127
00:05:41.328 --> 00:05:43.068
not on curve fitting.

128
00:05:43.068 --> 00:05:47.428
And I think that a lot of our physics today is missing that.

129
00:05:47.428 --> 00:05:52.428
So I think intuition and that whole psychic part,

130
00:05:52.468 --> 00:05:57.468
the intuitive part, the gut feeling is a big part of science

131
00:05:57.568 --> 00:06:01.308
that people are not being taught in school.

132
00:06:01.308 --> 00:06:03.128
<v Interviewer>And genuine curiosity?</v>

133
00:06:03.128 --> 00:06:04.728
<v ->And genuine curiosity, exactly.</v>

134
00:06:04.728 --> 00:06:07.668
A drive to get the answer, find out what it is.

135
00:06:07.668 --> 00:06:12.468
And for me, what I was searching,

136
00:06:12.468 --> 00:06:14.828
and then in the mid-eighties, I came across

137
00:06:14.828 --> 00:06:17.468
remote viewing and a couple other phenomena

138
00:06:17.468 --> 00:06:19.308
that I could not dismiss.

139
00:06:19.308 --> 00:06:22.688
They violated the physics that I had learned in school

140
00:06:22.688 --> 00:06:25.588
and I couldn't dismiss them, but at the same time,

141
00:06:25.588 --> 00:06:27.948
I couldn't explain them because they weren't

142
00:06:27.948 --> 00:06:29.728
anything I had ever encountered before

143
00:06:29.728 --> 00:06:32.188
and our physics can't understand this stuff.

144
00:06:32.188 --> 00:06:33.328
<v Interviewer>So if you can't beat 'em, join 'em?</v>

145
00:06:33.328 --> 00:06:35.928
<v ->Well, but I understand that period,</v>

146
00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:38.608
I went through a period of months, maybe a year or two,

147
00:06:38.608 --> 00:06:40.168
my brain was boggled.

148
00:06:40.168 --> 00:06:41.868
It's like having these two contradictory ideas

149
00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:43.548
at the same time and you can't decide

150
00:06:43.548 --> 00:06:45.169
how to fit them together.

151
00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:49.268
And that's really what started me on looking

152
00:06:49.268 --> 00:06:51.948
at all the different phenomena that

153
00:06:51.948 --> 00:06:54.988
our society considers to be anomalous,

154
00:06:54.988 --> 00:06:58.328
that our society makes fun of, we ridicule,

155
00:06:58.328 --> 00:07:02.428
we don't talk about them in the polite evening news,

156
00:07:02.428 --> 00:07:04.248
and I began trying to figure out,

157
00:07:04.248 --> 00:07:07.608
if these things are real, then what else is real

158
00:07:07.608 --> 00:07:10.688
and let me just find out from a very serious,

159
00:07:10.688 --> 00:07:12.928
rigorous, independent investigation.

160
00:07:12.928 --> 00:07:15.008
So that's where I started, going to conferences,

161
00:07:15.008 --> 00:07:17.448
reading the papers, talking to the researchers,

162
00:07:17.448 --> 00:07:19.028
and I was always skeptical.

163
00:07:19.028 --> 00:07:22.088
I mean, I was always ready and expecting them to be

164
00:07:22.088 --> 00:07:24.448
fooling me and things like that

165
00:07:24.448 --> 00:07:26.828
or just being flakes or nuts
<v Interviewer>Madame Zelda.</v>

166
00:07:26.828 --> 00:07:28.928
<v ->Yeah, people with their propeller heads</v>

167
00:07:28.928 --> 00:07:31.544
or aluminum foil, or something like that.

168
00:07:31.544 --> 00:07:33.764
The media prepares us for that,

169
00:07:33.764 --> 00:07:36.844
and I was amazed how many people are

170
00:07:36.844 --> 00:07:41.724
really solid, really credible, high integrity, intelligent.

171
00:07:41.724 --> 00:07:45.384
So anyway, that's some of how it got started.

172
00:07:45.384 --> 00:07:50.384
I started off with one or two ideas that I felt

173
00:07:50.624 --> 00:07:52.664
had to be included in current science.

174
00:07:52.664 --> 00:07:55.184
When I got finished, there were like 47 chapters

175
00:07:55.184 --> 00:07:57.544
of data on different types of phenomena

176
00:07:57.544 --> 00:08:01.004
that really our science needs to be able to understand.

177
00:08:01.004 --> 00:08:04.584
So it's a real deep revolution, I think, that...

178
00:08:04.584 --> 00:08:05.884
<v Interviewer>I think so too</v>

179
00:08:05.884 --> 00:08:07.904
and one of the things you talk about here,

180
00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:10.404
which is interesting is that the new sciences

181
00:08:10.404 --> 00:08:14.624
are resembling the magic that's spoken of in legends.

182
00:08:14.624 --> 00:08:15.884
<v ->Right.</v>

183
00:08:15.884 --> 00:08:19.184
You know, it's so interesting when you look at

184
00:08:19.184 --> 00:08:21.704
what the movies that are popular today.

185
00:08:21.704 --> 00:08:24.604
Harry Potter, look what a splash he's been.

186
00:08:24.604 --> 00:08:27.224
Look at Lord of the Rings, the trilogy,

187
00:08:27.224 --> 00:08:29.484
and the book before the movie, you know?

188
00:08:29.484 --> 00:08:33.904
And to me, you say okay there's magic in both those,

189
00:08:33.904 --> 00:08:36.784
but are they appealing to something deeper?

190
00:08:36.784 --> 00:08:39.704
Is there something deep inside us that recognizes

191
00:08:39.704 --> 00:08:43.884
or remembers something that was real, that was true?

192
00:08:43.884 --> 00:08:44.824
And I don't know.

193
00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:47.504
That's not an answer, but it's a suspicion,

194
00:08:47.504 --> 00:08:50.704
like what is it that makes those things so appealing to us?

195
00:08:50.704 --> 00:08:52.804
And it's just kind of interesting that

196
00:08:52.804 --> 00:08:55.404
our science is beginning to learn

197
00:08:55.404 --> 00:08:58.664
how some of those things might work.

198
00:08:58.664 --> 00:09:01.724
We have a Qigong master who's in China,

199
00:09:01.724 --> 00:09:05.804
these men who learn how to manipulate the Qi,

200
00:09:05.804 --> 00:09:09.164
the subtle energy in the body, both for healing,

201
00:09:09.164 --> 00:09:11.244
and also for fighting martial arts,

202
00:09:11.244 --> 00:09:13.764
for thousands of years, have used this energy.

203
00:09:13.764 --> 00:09:15.464
And there are Qigong masters who don't have

204
00:09:15.464 --> 00:09:17.504
to hit you to knock you down.

205
00:09:17.504 --> 00:09:19.164
They do a motion like that...

206
00:09:19.164 --> 00:09:20.624
<v Interviewer>I've been knocked over by one.</v>

207
00:09:20.624 --> 00:09:21.564
<v ->Well see?</v>

208
00:09:21.564 --> 00:09:22.483
<v Interviewer>Through a wall.</v>

209
00:09:22.483 --> 00:09:24.764
<v ->Well I want to talk to you about that later on</v>

210
00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:28.744
because I'm looking for good Qigong masters who can do that.

211
00:09:28.744 --> 00:09:30.184
But I know it happens.

212
00:09:30.184 --> 00:09:31.584
I've read the stories.

213
00:09:31.584 --> 00:09:33.724
I've talked to some of the researchers,

214
00:09:33.724 --> 00:09:35.584
and I know it's real.

215
00:09:35.584 --> 00:09:39.964
And that's a type of energy that you see in the jedi knights

216
00:09:39.964 --> 00:09:43.364
in the fantasy Star Wars movies,

217
00:09:43.364 --> 00:09:44.264
<v Interviewer>Very real.</v>

218
00:09:44.264 --> 00:09:46.664
<v ->but it's real and there are people who really do this.</v>

219
00:09:46.664 --> 00:09:51.283
Take the magic wand of Harry Potter for example.

220
00:09:51.283 --> 00:09:53.704
But if you start to do research on the subtle energy,

221
00:09:53.704 --> 00:09:56.524
you find that you really can collect it.

222
00:09:56.524 --> 00:10:00.164
You can build up a charge of subtle energy in a crystal

223
00:10:00.164 --> 00:10:01.484
or in a piece of wood.

224
00:10:01.484 --> 00:10:04.584
And I suspect that we're starting to understand

225
00:10:04.584 --> 00:10:08.984
how some of these magical things from the past,

226
00:10:08.984 --> 00:10:11.364
how maybe we can reproduce them in the laboratory.

227
00:10:11.364 --> 00:10:13.304
So I think we're on the edge of something

228
00:10:13.304 --> 00:10:14.664
kind of interesting here.

229
00:10:14.664 --> 00:10:16.904
<v Interviewer>Speaking of age of something interesting,</v>

230
00:10:16.904 --> 00:10:20.244
you talk about how ESP, basically psychic phenomena

231
00:10:20.244 --> 00:10:23.724
works better with certain galactic alignments for example.

232
00:10:23.724 --> 00:10:25.124
Can you talk about that a bit because

233
00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:28.058
that gets back to the conference of CPAC and recession.

234
00:10:28.058 --> 00:10:31.458
<v ->Right, yeah, well Dr. James Spottiswoode,</v>

235
00:10:31.458 --> 00:10:35.898
who is a statistician, did a lot of work on

236
00:10:35.898 --> 00:10:39.498
the accuracy of different remote viewing experiments

237
00:10:39.498 --> 00:10:43.178
and ESP experiments, taking data from

238
00:10:43.178 --> 00:10:45.518
many hundreds of different cases,

239
00:10:45.518 --> 00:10:48.338
different times of day, different places in the world,

240
00:10:48.338 --> 00:10:51.218
and was looking for some correlation.

241
00:10:51.218 --> 00:10:53.878
What is it that makes remote viewing or ESP

242
00:10:53.878 --> 00:10:56.138
more accurate or less accurate?

243
00:10:56.138 --> 00:10:58.278
And the one result he came up with,

244
00:10:58.278 --> 00:11:02.738
the strongest effect, is what the astronomers call

245
00:11:02.738 --> 00:11:05.798
sidereal time, which is star time.

246
00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:08.258
In other words, when certain stars are overhead,

247
00:11:08.258 --> 00:11:13.178
that's when, as a receiver, ESP is about four times

248
00:11:13.178 --> 00:11:15.098
more accurate than average.

249
00:11:15.098 --> 00:11:17.638
This is a very rigorous result.

250
00:11:17.638 --> 00:11:20.438
The question is why.

251
00:11:20.438 --> 00:11:23.038
And we don't have a certain answer for that,

252
00:11:23.038 --> 00:11:26.938
but it turns out that reception is most accurate

253
00:11:26.938 --> 00:11:29.758
when the constellation virgo is overhead,

254
00:11:29.758 --> 00:11:32.558
the last two stars in the handle of the big dipper

255
00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:33.218
are overhead.

256
00:11:33.218 --> 00:11:36.478
That is 13.5 hours sidereal, which is what

257
00:11:36.478 --> 00:11:38.318
astronomers would call it,

258
00:11:38.318 --> 00:11:39.998
and that works daytime or nighttime.

259
00:11:39.998 --> 00:11:40.798
It doesn't matter.

260
00:11:40.798 --> 00:11:41.678
You don't have to be able to see it

261
00:11:41.678 --> 00:11:43.178
for it to have an effect.

262
00:11:43.178 --> 00:11:46.138
It just so happens that that is the time

263
00:11:46.138 --> 00:11:48.818
when a very anomalous region of the sky

264
00:11:48.818 --> 00:11:51.538
called the great attractor is overhead.

265
00:11:51.538 --> 00:11:55.558
This is an area where a lot of dark matter

266
00:11:55.558 --> 00:11:58.218
and dark energy is found today.

267
00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:02.618
And there have been theories, there are theories,

268
00:12:02.618 --> 00:12:07.318
that there may be certain types of particles, perhaps,

269
00:12:07.318 --> 00:12:09.158
or types of radiation that are coming from there,

270
00:12:09.158 --> 00:12:12.358
certain types of anomalies that may be associated

271
00:12:12.358 --> 00:12:13.878
with that dark matter.

272
00:12:13.878 --> 00:12:17.058
Whatever it is, we know that our psychic ability

273
00:12:17.058 --> 00:12:20.938
is more accurate and more clear during that time.

274
00:12:20.938 --> 00:12:23.378
<v Interviewer>Does it have anything to do with,</v>

275
00:12:23.378 --> 00:12:27.218
say raising our gamma range of frequencies?

276
00:12:27.218 --> 00:12:28.399
Or does it, I don't know...

277
00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:29.438
<v ->I don't know.</v>

278
00:12:29.438 --> 00:12:30.778
I don't think so.

279
00:12:30.778 --> 00:12:31.638
<v Interviewer>Yeah I'm just curious.</v>

280
00:12:31.638 --> 00:12:32.578
<v ->I don't think so.</v>

281
00:12:32.578 --> 00:12:34.618
I think the people...

282
00:12:34.618 --> 00:12:38.738
What I suspect is that for some reason,

283
00:12:38.738 --> 00:12:40.918
well I don't know.

284
00:12:40.918 --> 00:12:42.698
<v Interviewer>Yeah okay, that's just out of the blue,</v>

285
00:12:42.698 --> 00:12:43.858
<v ->But it's an observation,</v>

286
00:12:43.858 --> 00:12:46.818
but what was interesting to me was that

287
00:12:46.818 --> 00:12:51.818
since it's based on a certain part of the sky

288
00:12:52.698 --> 00:12:55.038
that's affecting us, therefore when the Earth is

289
00:12:55.038 --> 00:12:57.898
at that angle where that part is overhead,

290
00:12:57.898 --> 00:13:00.338
that's the best time, what would happen

291
00:13:00.338 --> 00:13:03.838
if we are in one of these binary star systems?

292
00:13:03.838 --> 00:13:06.758
That there is some kind of long period cycle,

293
00:13:06.758 --> 00:13:10.218
26,000, 24,000 years, what that would mean is

294
00:13:10.218 --> 00:13:13.658
that part of that orbit, we're going towards this region,

295
00:13:13.658 --> 00:13:16.318
during part we're moving away from that region.

296
00:13:16.318 --> 00:13:18.398
So you might expect a doppler shift.

297
00:13:18.398 --> 00:13:21.158
You might expect a frequency shift going toward

298
00:13:21.158 --> 00:13:23.478
or going away from that might modulate

299
00:13:23.478 --> 00:13:25.258
the strength of that effect.

300
00:13:25.258 --> 00:13:28.738
So that was the suggestion, and right now,

301
00:13:28.738 --> 00:13:29.659
it's just a suggestion.

302
00:13:29.659 --> 00:13:30.858
We don't really know, but...

303
00:13:30.858 --> 00:13:32.438
<v Interviewer>Whatever it is, it seems to be working.</v>

304
00:13:32.438 --> 00:13:36.938
<v ->But if there is something to these cycles,</v>

305
00:13:36.938 --> 00:13:39.598
the yuga cycles, the cycles of the ages,

306
00:13:39.598 --> 00:13:41.318
then this would be a possible model

307
00:13:41.318 --> 00:13:42.418
that might explain it, so...

308
00:13:42.418 --> 00:13:43.298
<v Interviewer>And this is going to have</v>

309
00:13:43.298 --> 00:13:45.018
an effect on everybody, not just the few that can,

310
00:13:45.018 --> 00:13:47.718
like this man you talked about, Zhang,

311
00:13:47.718 --> 00:13:49.898
the Chinese subject who was able to...

312
00:13:49.898 --> 00:13:51.458
<v ->Teleport, yes</v>

313
00:13:51.458 --> 00:13:53.478
<v Interviewer>teleport, and how did that work</v>

314
00:13:53.478 --> 00:13:56.058
with that sack of sugar?

315
00:13:56.058 --> 00:14:00.238
<v ->Yeah, well Paul Dong, who is a Chinese American,</v>

316
00:14:00.238 --> 00:14:04.638
and a Qigong master, himself, has spent a lot

317
00:14:04.638 --> 00:14:09.638
of time in China and interviewed a lot of these healers

318
00:14:10.018 --> 00:14:12.478
and psychics over there, done a lot of research,

319
00:14:12.478 --> 00:14:14.118
written four books about it.

320
00:14:14.118 --> 00:14:19.118
Back in the 80's, there was a period where

321
00:14:19.478 --> 00:14:21.898
the Chinese government was more forthcoming

322
00:14:21.898 --> 00:14:23.638
about what they were doing.

323
00:14:23.638 --> 00:14:26.718
They were doing research on psychic phenomena

324
00:14:26.718 --> 00:14:28.198
among Chinese.

325
00:14:28.198 --> 00:14:31.738
They basically did a survey of their billion plus population

326
00:14:31.738 --> 00:14:34.298
to find those who were the most powerful,

327
00:14:34.298 --> 00:14:37.378
and they called them the EHF,

328
00:14:37.378 --> 00:14:39.878
the extra-high functioning people,

329
00:14:39.878 --> 00:14:41.218
and most of them were young people,

330
00:14:41.218 --> 00:14:42.418
just because that's when
<v Interviewer>I was going</v>

331
00:14:42.418 --> 00:14:43.618
to say there was a whole
<v ->powers are usually greatest</v>

332
00:14:43.618 --> 00:14:44.858
<v Interviewer>Yeah exactly.</v>

333
00:14:44.858 --> 00:14:47.318
<v ->And some of them can do amazing things.</v>

334
00:14:47.318 --> 00:14:50.638
And he's written a book or two with examples,

335
00:14:50.638 --> 00:14:53.638
but there was also a period of time where

336
00:14:53.638 --> 00:14:57.178
VIP visitors to China would get demonstrations.

337
00:14:57.178 --> 00:15:00.458
And I went to China in 79.

338
00:15:00.458 --> 00:15:02.818
I was not enough of a VIP to get a private demonstration.

339
00:15:02.818 --> 00:15:04.278
<v Interviewer>Darn, wouldn't you love to be there?</v>

340
00:15:04.278 --> 00:15:05.276
<v ->But I knew people who did.</v>

341
00:15:05.276 --> 00:15:09.536
I knew four people who independently got VIP demonstrations

342
00:15:09.536 --> 00:15:14.536
with teleportation where they had a little radio transmitter

343
00:15:15.576 --> 00:15:18.016
they put in somebody's pocket and they would have

344
00:15:18.016 --> 00:15:21.436
one of these EHF people cause it to telport,

345
00:15:21.436 --> 00:15:24.836
and meanwhile, there was a radio tracking device

346
00:15:24.836 --> 00:15:26.956
to track this little thing.

347
00:15:26.956 --> 00:15:29.576
The frequency would go down to zero

348
00:15:29.576 --> 00:15:32.216
and then it would come back up again somewhere else.

349
00:15:32.216 --> 00:15:34.116
And at that moment, it had appeared in

350
00:15:34.116 --> 00:15:36.076
somebody else's pocket somewhere else.

351
00:15:36.076 --> 00:15:39.196
<v Interviewer>Went to the zero point field.</v>

352
00:15:39.196 --> 00:15:42.837
<v ->Yeah it turns out that in quantum mechanics,</v>

353
00:15:42.837 --> 00:15:44.716
now our quantum mechanics can't explain this,

354
00:15:44.716 --> 00:15:49.056
but it does have, there is some consistency,

355
00:15:49.056 --> 00:15:51.256
because in quantum mechanics, when the frequency

356
00:15:51.256 --> 00:15:55.456
goes very low, the position becomes very spread out.

357
00:15:55.456 --> 00:15:57.916
So it's almost like it's becoming very spread out

358
00:15:57.916 --> 00:16:01.056
and then reassembling again somewhere else.

359
00:16:01.056 --> 00:16:02.866
<v Interviewer>Almost very diffuse in a way.</v>

360
00:16:02.866 --> 00:16:03.734
<v ->Yeah, exactly.</v>

361
00:16:03.734 --> 00:16:06.514
So there's a sense that this is probably true

362
00:16:06.514 --> 00:16:08.454
with four different people reporting this,

363
00:16:08.454 --> 00:16:12.714
Zhang has talked about it in one of Paul Dong's books.

364
00:16:12.714 --> 00:16:16.534
He is considered to be a national treasure in China.

365
00:16:16.534 --> 00:16:21.534
He's able to apparently cause teleportation of objects.

366
00:16:22.714 --> 00:16:27.714
The story in Paul Dong's book says that

367
00:16:28.334 --> 00:16:32.034
initially, he was pulled into a military project.

368
00:16:32.034 --> 00:16:35.214
The general was very skeptical about his abilities.

369
00:16:35.214 --> 00:16:38.254
So he had Zhang locked in a room,

370
00:16:38.254 --> 00:16:41.174
put under military guard, and he drove home.

371
00:16:41.174 --> 00:16:43.494
When he got home, Zhang was sitting there

372
00:16:43.494 --> 00:16:45.154
in his living room waiting for him.

373
00:16:45.154 --> 00:16:48.094
(laughter)

374
00:16:48.094 --> 00:16:51.554
And Zhang became sort of famous in China.

375
00:16:51.554 --> 00:16:56.554
He was given money and a luxury sports car

376
00:16:57.574 --> 00:17:00.394
by a millionaire Chinese business man

377
00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:02.994
who wanted to thank him for what he was doing,

378
00:17:02.994 --> 00:17:05.794
and he would race around Hong Kong at breakneck speed

379
00:17:05.794 --> 00:17:07.394
in this sports car.

380
00:17:07.394 --> 00:17:09.954
He was given traffic tickets by the Hong Kong police

381
00:17:09.954 --> 00:17:11.334
by the dozens.

382
00:17:11.334 --> 00:17:14.034
After a while, they stopped because

383
00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:15.414
they noticed whenever they got back

384
00:17:15.414 --> 00:17:17.754
to their police station, the tickets had disappeared.

385
00:17:17.754 --> 00:17:18.834
<v Interviewer>I was going to say I bet</v>

386
00:17:18.834 --> 00:17:21.394
he disappeared them, that's great.

387
00:17:21.394 --> 00:17:24.234
<v ->Yeah, so he's kind of an institution there.</v>

388
00:17:24.234 --> 00:17:25.254
<v Interviewer>Wow, now that's an incentive</v>

389
00:17:25.254 --> 00:17:26.914
to start bumping it up a bit, isn't it?

390
00:17:26.914 --> 00:17:29.454
<v ->Yeah, to practice these abilities.</v>

391
00:17:29.454 --> 00:17:32.854
One thing that I think has happened is

392
00:17:32.854 --> 00:17:37.034
that the Chinese have realized that

393
00:17:37.034 --> 00:17:41.814
there's a lot of military applications to these abilities,

394
00:17:41.814 --> 00:17:46.114
and so they've become much quieter,

395
00:17:46.114 --> 00:17:48.094
much harder to get information out

396
00:17:48.094 --> 00:17:50.474
from what's going on over there.

397
00:17:50.474 --> 00:17:52.194
And I think in this country too,

398
00:17:52.194 --> 00:17:54.854
the remote viewing program is one thing...

399
00:17:54.854 --> 00:17:55.494
<v Interviewer>I was going to say,</v>

400
00:17:55.494 --> 00:17:56.894
that's what I've read is some of these kids

401
00:17:56.894 --> 00:18:00.394
are remote viewing positions for strategic...

402
00:18:00.394 --> 00:18:03.054
<v ->Yeah, and so that one program became public,</v>

403
00:18:03.054 --> 00:18:05.234
but we can probably assume there are plenty

404
00:18:05.234 --> 00:18:06.894
of other programs that aren't public, you know.

405
00:18:06.894 --> 00:18:10.914
So it's always hard trying to do research in this area

406
00:18:10.914 --> 00:18:13.194
because you have to work with whatever information

407
00:18:13.194 --> 00:18:15.974
you can catch here and there.

408
00:18:15.974 --> 00:18:18.574
You know there's probably a lot more that's not available.

409
00:18:18.574 --> 00:18:21.514
<v Interviewer>Right, so as we progress along,</v>

410
00:18:21.514 --> 00:18:23.654
we could go off on a thousand different tangents

411
00:18:23.654 --> 00:18:26.254
very easily here because you have such a vast wealth

412
00:18:26.254 --> 00:18:29.614
of information, but I thought we'd just try to tie it up

413
00:18:29.614 --> 00:18:31.974
with the notion of parallel universes.

414
00:18:31.974 --> 00:18:34.134
Michio Kaku gets into this in his work,

415
00:18:34.134 --> 00:18:36.134
and we've also spoken with him.

416
00:18:36.134 --> 00:18:37.534
He talks about it on our site,

417
00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:40.274
and the fact that in these parallel universes,

418
00:18:40.274 --> 00:18:42.634
we're not aware of each other.

419
00:18:42.634 --> 00:18:44.614
Can you just talk about what this means

420
00:18:44.614 --> 00:18:46.454
and how we might start becoming aware

421
00:18:46.454 --> 00:18:48.574
and just do a little tie up for us here.

422
00:18:48.574 --> 00:18:51.294
<v ->Sure, well with parallel universes,</v>

423
00:18:51.294 --> 00:18:53.434
it depends on what your theory is,

424
00:18:53.434 --> 00:18:56.434
as far as how we might be able to get from here to there.

425
00:18:56.434 --> 00:18:59.674
With a lot of the current string theory models,

426
00:18:59.674 --> 00:19:03.474
as I understand them, these other dimensions are very small.

427
00:19:03.474 --> 00:19:06.894
They roll up into little strings in very small dimensions

428
00:19:06.894 --> 00:19:09.234
and so getting from our dimension to somebody

429
00:19:09.234 --> 00:19:12.974
else's dimension, it's not obvious how you would do that.

430
00:19:12.974 --> 00:19:17.974
But in my model, basically there's a frequency

431
00:19:18.454 --> 00:19:21.194
and a phase that separates one from the other.

432
00:19:21.194 --> 00:19:25.094
In other words, you could think about it is almost

433
00:19:25.094 --> 00:19:28.974
as if just might be able to create a high-frequency field

434
00:19:28.974 --> 00:19:31.034
that changes our rate of vibration,

435
00:19:31.034 --> 00:19:34.734
we could then see into or shift into another dimension.

436
00:19:34.734 --> 00:19:36.634
So those are kind of parallel realities.

437
00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:39.014
They're physical, just like this one,

438
00:19:39.014 --> 00:19:41.434
and it would be a way to connect from one to the other.

439
00:19:41.434 --> 00:19:44.074
At the same time, we have these higher dimensions.

440
00:19:44.074 --> 00:19:47.194
We have the astral domains and the causal domains.

441
00:19:47.194 --> 00:19:49.954
We have ghosts and people who have passed away

442
00:19:49.954 --> 00:19:52.294
who are on the other side and those,

443
00:19:52.294 --> 00:19:54.614
that process is probably different.

444
00:19:54.614 --> 00:19:57.954
I think subtle energy is probably one key

445
00:19:57.954 --> 00:20:01.214
to how we would be able to look into those domains.

446
00:20:01.214 --> 00:20:05.454
There's a scientist in England who has developed

447
00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:09.494
a filter you put on a camera that he claims

448
00:20:09.494 --> 00:20:12.114
allows us to see the etheric dimension,

449
00:20:12.114 --> 00:20:14.654
and he has some good, very interesting results.

450
00:20:14.654 --> 00:20:17.074
They may be working, hard to be sure.

451
00:20:17.074 --> 00:20:22.074
But I think as a first step, we're just learning

452
00:20:22.794 --> 00:20:25.694
that the physical is not all there is.

453
00:20:25.694 --> 00:20:28.874
These other dimensions exist and...

454
00:20:28.874 --> 00:20:29.994
<v Interviewer>And no one would really say that</v>

455
00:20:29.994 --> 00:20:31.954
on camera even a decade ago persay.

456
00:20:31.954 --> 00:20:34.334
<v ->Well like the Hindus have said for thousands of years,</v>

457
00:20:34.334 --> 00:20:37.374
this is maya, this is illusion.

458
00:20:37.374 --> 00:20:39.534
The real stuff's happening at higher dimensions

459
00:20:39.534 --> 00:20:43.194
and if we really learn to take that seriously,

460
00:20:43.194 --> 00:20:44.834
we might lighten up a little bit.

461
00:20:44.834 --> 00:20:47.474
You know, we might not get so hung up on the physical stuff,

462
00:20:47.474 --> 00:20:50.374
and maybe pay a little more attention to the spiritual side.

463
00:20:50.374 --> 00:20:52.114
<v Interviewer>Absolutely, and for people</v>

464
00:20:52.114 --> 00:20:55.134
to get seriously into this information,

465
00:20:55.134 --> 00:20:56.814
I would certainly recommend that they read

466
00:20:56.814 --> 00:20:58.954
The Synchronized Universe because you've just done

467
00:20:58.954 --> 00:21:00.914
an incredible compilation of work there.

468
00:21:00.914 --> 00:21:01.614
<v ->Thank you very much.</v>

469
00:21:01.614 --> 00:21:02.894
<v Interviewer>And thank you for your time.</v>
