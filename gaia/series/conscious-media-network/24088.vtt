00:00:01.831 --> 00:00:04.171
<v ->Who are the people that make bold decisions,</v>

2
00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:06.851
even in the worst of times? Visionaries.

3
00:00:06.851 --> 00:00:09.571
Author Jim Hamilton is not talking about the people

4
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:12.631
that make the headlines of the news with audacious takeovers

5
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:15.691
of companies and the like, but people like you and me.

6
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:19.051
He says that each one of us has innate tools to become a

7
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:21.810
visionary, which he says is going to be the difference

8
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.171
between following other people's agendas through out

9
00:00:24.171 --> 00:00:26.840
our lives, and creating our own.

10
00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:38.390
How do you actually define visionaries, because I notice

11
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.931
from your book it doesn't have anything to do with

12
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:44.311
famous individuals throughout history but this is about

13
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:48.641
people, forward thinking individuals of all kinds.

14
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.091
<v ->Yes, this is about each of us, one of us at a time</v>

15
00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:56.421
discovering our innateness and becoming what we can become.

16
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:01.665
The visionary idea, you know, revolves around what other

17
00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:04.945
people have done but I'm trying to promote an understanding

18
00:01:04.945 --> 00:01:09.405
of who we each are, and what we can become

19
00:01:09.405 --> 00:01:11.945
and we do it with our mind and our thoughts and

20
00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:14.695
our awareness and our perception.

21
00:01:15.424 --> 00:01:17.185
<v ->And the name, the full title of the book is</v>

22
00:01:17.185 --> 00:01:19.205
"Visionaries Thrive At All Times".

23
00:01:19.205 --> 00:01:21.565
<v ->In all times, yes.
<v ->Yes.</v>

24
00:01:21.565 --> 00:01:26.565
And so, let's begin there then, what is the visionary mind

25
00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:31.055
capable of doing that makes it so flexible?

26
00:01:31.305 --> 00:01:33.645
And then we can start going into more specifics

27
00:01:33.645 --> 00:01:36.975
but just as a beginning point.

28
00:01:37.345 --> 00:01:40.205
<v ->Maybe we'd start with our imagination.</v>

29
00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:42.124
How much of the world is here

30
00:01:42.124 --> 00:01:44.225
as a result of our imagination?

31
00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:48.305
A result of things we've thought about or things we've

32
00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:50.705
envisioned, there's an interesting word,

33
00:01:50.705 --> 00:01:52.524
of things that we would like to be.

34
00:01:52.524 --> 00:01:55.605
We all do it with our families, we do it in our businesses,

35
00:01:55.605 --> 00:02:00.605
success is a visionary mode and becoming what we can become

36
00:02:01.285 --> 00:02:04.265
is something that starts with our mind and our perceptions.

37
00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:07.144
And so learning how to harness this and become intentional

38
00:02:07.144 --> 00:02:11.275
with it is how humanity is going to get where it can go.

39
00:02:11.624 --> 00:02:13.785
<v ->And that's really a big point you just made is how to</v>

40
00:02:13.785 --> 00:02:17.005
harness it and work with it with our own true intention

41
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:20.605
and will and desire versus allowing our subconscious

42
00:02:20.605 --> 00:02:24.204
programming to dictate what our lives are looking like

43
00:02:24.204 --> 00:02:27.665
and I think we can all look around and see that.

44
00:02:27.665 --> 00:02:29.925
At least the vestiges of it and we're living,

45
00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:32.685
how we conduct our lives and relationships.

46
00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:36.685
<v ->Well, the title of the book comes from an expression.</v>

47
00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:41.685
Observers thrive in good times and suffer in bad.

48
00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:45.595
Visionaries thrive in all times.

49
00:02:45.745 --> 00:02:49.485
So much of us spend most of our life absorbing what's

50
00:02:49.485 --> 00:02:54.145
going on around us, taking it in, titillating our nervous

51
00:02:54.145 --> 00:02:57.185
system with what we've absorbed and then we

52
00:02:57.185 --> 00:02:59.405
kind of broadcast that back out,

53
00:02:59.405 --> 00:03:03.585
and therefore we repeat reality as it exists

54
00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:06.738
and that kind of the, I won't say the dumb way of doing

55
00:03:06.738 --> 00:03:09.758
things but obviously there's a lot to learn as

56
00:03:09.758 --> 00:03:12.679
a species about how to go forward.

57
00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:15.379
How to make our survival more useful to us and

58
00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.119
unfold it in the manner we wish and obviously it's up to

59
00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:24.049
us to become intentional and this is what the book is about.

60
00:03:24.558 --> 00:03:28.938
<v ->And you read books like Bruce Lipton's "Biology of Belief"</v>

61
00:03:28.938 --> 00:03:31.839
and we also have another man, Rob Williams on our site,

62
00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:36.679
they work together a lot, about the subject that what our

63
00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:41.679
lives are are virtually 95% plus driven by unconscious

64
00:03:42.738 --> 00:03:47.738
or subconscious data, input, and we're just like you say

65
00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:51.519
the observers, you take it in and then you reflect it back

66
00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.258
and then you get more of the same and you reflect it back.

67
00:03:54.258 --> 00:03:57.429
What happens when we go into challenging times then?

68
00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.019
<v ->Well certainly reaction is a very powerful tool</v>

69
00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.679
that we've used for a very long time and

70
00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:09.038
what we really need to do it go beyond that.

71
00:04:11.128 --> 00:04:14.899
Humans have always done the best they can

72
00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:18.418
and we're moving to a point of becoming intentional

73
00:04:18.418 --> 00:04:22.939
in our lives and what we're primarily a product of

74
00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:26.338
is our habitual patterns and our habitual patterns

75
00:04:26.338 --> 00:04:30.868
are learned and they're a product of our genetics.

76
00:04:30.898 --> 00:04:34.039
In other words, we are the end result of the decisions

77
00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.639
that came before us in our entire lineage.

78
00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.119
And so, habitual patterns is the easy way.

79
00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:44.220
It's for the most part the only way and becoming

80
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.920
conscious means moving beyond what's been habitual

81
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.610
for us and obviously the easy way.

82
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.920
<v ->And I suppose one of the most extreme examples of that</v>

83
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.640
would be if you see people in today's world that are in

84
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.840
total subjugation to others in the species in essence.

85
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.977
Women that are still living behind veils or behind doors

86
00:05:08.977 --> 00:05:11.537
and not allowed to go out into the public.

87
00:05:11.537 --> 00:05:14.277
This is really just an expression of what

88
00:05:14.277 --> 00:05:17.197
their expectation as a soul, as in

89
00:05:17.197 --> 00:05:21.537
continuing to come into this pattern and to be,

90
00:05:21.537 --> 00:05:25.636
have this pattern repeated throughout future generations.

91
00:05:25.636 --> 00:05:28.797
That's the expectations so that's what you get.

92
00:05:28.797 --> 00:05:33.677
So for that soul, that is an expression if it's knowingness

93
00:05:33.677 --> 00:05:36.677
and it's expectation in life, right?

94
00:05:36.677 --> 00:05:39.977
<v ->It also gives us the contrast to want more.</v>

95
00:05:39.977 --> 00:05:41.416
<v ->Exactly.</v>

96
00:05:41.416 --> 00:05:43.966
<v ->Whether it be the individual wearing the veil and</v>

97
00:05:43.966 --> 00:05:46.925
living in that kind of environment or the people that

98
00:05:46.925 --> 00:05:50.426
from a distance see that, either way there's an impetus to

99
00:05:50.426 --> 00:05:54.716
have more and maybe that's where the visionary mode starts.

100
00:05:54.946 --> 00:05:58.125
<v ->So, let's get into some specifics then about where</v>

101
00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:01.106
a person begins to go into visionary mode.

102
00:06:01.106 --> 00:06:03.885
We're here, we're observers, we're putting

103
00:06:03.885 --> 00:06:05.746
it out, we're getting it back.

104
00:06:05.746 --> 00:06:08.065
We're tired of the same old feedback loop.

105
00:06:08.065 --> 00:06:09.626
Now we want to break out of that.

106
00:06:09.626 --> 00:06:11.506
Where would you begin, or where

107
00:06:11.506 --> 00:06:13.246
would you suggest people begin?

108
00:06:13.246 --> 00:06:16.726
<v ->Well, clearly the concept, it's fairly basic and</v>

109
00:06:16.726 --> 00:06:19.686
that is out of contrast comes clarity.

110
00:06:19.686 --> 00:06:23.266
So, the pain, let's not use the word pain, but

111
00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:27.845
the difficulty that people lives their life with

112
00:06:27.845 --> 00:06:32.495
the rote existence or the slow upward spiral.

113
00:06:32.495 --> 00:06:36.675
There's a, ultimately as things move faster there's

114
00:06:36.675 --> 00:06:39.895
a discomfort with things being the same.

115
00:06:39.895 --> 00:06:42.855
And breaking out of that is a product of

116
00:06:42.855 --> 00:06:46.115
out of contrast comes clarity and so your visionary

117
00:06:46.115 --> 00:06:49.034
mode springs from the idea of clarity.

118
00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:52.175
An example might be, and this is somewhat political,

119
00:06:52.175 --> 00:06:56.010
but let's say that you have a country and they have leaders.

120
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.270
And the leaders off on their on tangent

121
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.870
with ideas about what's best.

122
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.420
<v ->But that doesn't ever really happen, does it? Not really.</v>

123
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.533
<v ->I don't, well not in the world I live in.</v>

124
00:07:04.533 --> 00:07:08.234
Actually, I've learned how to see things as they really are.

125
00:07:08.234 --> 00:07:10.354
And when you have leadership off on

126
00:07:10.354 --> 00:07:13.284
a tangent, I'll give you an example.

127
00:07:13.773 --> 00:07:18.584
Okay, we bombed Afghanistan years ago.

128
00:07:19.234 --> 00:07:22.394
There was a lot of people that bought into that.

129
00:07:22.394 --> 00:07:25.053
The United States of America bombed Afghanistan with

130
00:07:25.053 --> 00:07:27.214
the Iraqi thing and all the things that went on

131
00:07:27.214 --> 00:07:29.314
and a lot of people bought into that,

132
00:07:29.314 --> 00:07:31.594
kind of a fear based mentality.

133
00:07:31.594 --> 00:07:34.734
And they went with it and accepted it, if nothing else,

134
00:07:34.734 --> 00:07:38.444
leadership knows best, the authority figures know best.

135
00:07:39.133 --> 00:07:42.633
And as it's deteriorated, there's a lot of people that stood

136
00:07:42.633 --> 00:07:44.834
back and said no, that's actually one of the few times

137
00:07:44.834 --> 00:07:47.834
I was truly afraid when we bombed Afghanistan.

138
00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:50.057
That concerned me a great deal for a number of reasons.

139
00:07:50.057 --> 00:07:51.697
<v ->Yes.</v>

140
00:07:51.697 --> 00:07:55.156
<v ->But the people that supported that, as it's</v>

141
00:07:55.156 --> 00:07:57.877
deteriorated a lot of them have come to see

142
00:07:57.877 --> 00:08:00.917
with concern that it hasn't gone very well.

143
00:08:00.917 --> 00:08:04.517
And where they, at one point, automatically assumed

144
00:08:04.517 --> 00:08:08.376
the leadership, assumed the way things were going,

145
00:08:08.376 --> 00:08:10.098
they're actually starting to think for themselves.

146
00:08:10.098 --> 00:08:11.518
Okay, that's huge.

147
00:08:11.518 --> 00:08:13.579
<v ->As you say with contrast comes clarity.</v>

148
00:08:13.579 --> 00:08:16.098
<v ->Absolutely, so I prefer not to use kind of a political</v>

149
00:08:16.098 --> 00:08:18.659
example but it's a really good one because guess what?

150
00:08:18.659 --> 00:08:20.459
We're all becoming one,

151
00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:23.629
the internet has connected all of us.

152
00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:27.539
We used to share our fears, and now we're starting

153
00:08:27.539 --> 00:08:30.039
to share our solutions and it's getting bigger,

154
00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:33.818
on a humanity scale not just America.

155
00:08:33.818 --> 00:08:37.289
Not just, you know, we're starting to discover...

156
00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.559
You know, somebody would say the Chinese are the bad guys.

157
00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.539
Somebody would say the Chinese are the enemy

158
00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.180
or different people and it's just not true.

159
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.500
We're all humans, we all come from the same place.

160
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.360
We all come from the same existence.

161
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.662
We're all starting to flower into our humaneness and

162
00:08:55.662 --> 00:08:58.042
we're discovering we're all the same.

163
00:08:58.042 --> 00:09:01.662
And so I think there's a slowly growing consensus that

164
00:09:01.662 --> 00:09:05.862
being human is more important that following the leader.

165
00:09:05.862 --> 00:09:08.022
<v ->Being human is more unifying than,</v>

166
00:09:08.022 --> 00:09:10.242
for example, any territorial issue.

167
00:09:10.242 --> 00:09:12.262
<v ->It's more soul satisfying as well.</v>

168
00:09:12.262 --> 00:09:13.402
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

169
00:09:13.402 --> 00:09:16.262
<v ->And this is what's coming, it's coming very rapidly</v>

170
00:09:16.262 --> 00:09:19.422
and in fact I wrote the book because the book is really

171
00:09:19.422 --> 00:09:22.042
about what I'd call good news and that is

172
00:09:22.042 --> 00:09:26.342
in our succession, if that's the right word, as a species

173
00:09:26.342 --> 00:09:28.862
we're unfolding toward our potential and

174
00:09:28.862 --> 00:09:31.002
come hell or high water we will.

175
00:09:31.002 --> 00:09:32.642
And maybe there's going to be a little hell and a little

176
00:09:32.642 --> 00:09:35.782
high water, but again out of this contrast we're going to

177
00:09:35.782 --> 00:09:39.342
unfold into our potential and unfold we will.

178
00:09:39.342 --> 00:09:41.222
And there's no stopping it.

179
00:09:41.222 --> 00:09:45.402
<v ->And when you say come hell or high water and one of</v>

180
00:09:45.402 --> 00:09:49.102
the words you use in your book is chaortic,

181
00:09:49.102 --> 00:09:52.082
which I find an interesting word.

182
00:09:52.082 --> 00:09:53.642
Is it appropriate at this time to

183
00:09:53.642 --> 00:09:56.742
expand on the concept of chaortism.

184
00:09:56.742 --> 00:09:59.782
<v ->Well, chaortic is not my term, it comes from</v>

185
00:09:59.782 --> 00:10:04.562
Dee Hock, who I say founded Visa, I believe he

186
00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:06.966
bought it when it was a young company.

187
00:10:06.966 --> 00:10:08.086
<v ->Right.</v>

188
00:10:08.086 --> 00:10:12.686
<v ->And he has discovered the importance of flexibility</v>

189
00:10:12.686 --> 00:10:16.806
and also what I would call infusing, now this is my term

190
00:10:16.806 --> 00:10:19.666
and the way I describe it, but infusing

191
00:10:19.666 --> 00:10:23.116
innate intelligence into structure.

192
00:10:23.726 --> 00:10:28.206
So chaortic is a combination of chaos and probably order

193
00:10:28.206 --> 00:10:31.986
and it's, I'll give you a good example.

194
00:10:31.986 --> 00:10:34.166
In the appendix in my book, I show a

195
00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:38.086
a picture that's hard to see what it is.

196
00:10:38.086 --> 00:10:41.026
And then on the next page it's the entire cover of

197
00:10:41.026 --> 00:10:44.966
my book with a little dotted window that is actually

198
00:10:44.966 --> 00:10:47.926
a small portion of the cover blown up to large

199
00:10:47.926 --> 00:10:52.766
and when you're looking at the chaos version,

200
00:10:52.766 --> 00:10:55.526
you can't tell what you're looking at and then when

201
00:10:55.526 --> 00:10:58.246
you can see the whole thing, the title, the cover,

202
00:10:58.246 --> 00:11:00.906
you can see that it's a small portion of the cover.

203
00:11:00.906 --> 00:11:04.946
And the point is is that chaos doesn't really exist,

204
00:11:04.946 --> 00:11:08.966
it's a lack of perception so Dee Hock with chaortic

205
00:11:08.966 --> 00:11:12.826
has come to harness what appears to be chaos

206
00:11:12.826 --> 00:11:17.586
and order and, I like to use the term flexibility because

207
00:11:17.586 --> 00:11:22.286
ultimately he's created a model of a corporation that

208
00:11:22.286 --> 00:11:27.286
at it's notal points has flexibility.

209
00:11:27.986 --> 00:11:30.526
And ultimately flexibility means innate

210
00:11:30.526 --> 00:11:33.346
intelligence is infused into this process.

211
00:11:33.346 --> 00:11:36.986
I'll also add that he, I call it a hint in my book,

212
00:11:36.986 --> 00:11:40.486
that he studied the Constitution of the United States

213
00:11:40.486 --> 00:11:43.966
of America and in its flexibility and its innate,

214
00:11:43.966 --> 00:11:48.546
what would I call it, its innate foundational ideas

215
00:11:48.546 --> 00:11:52.696
founded his corporation and rebuilt it.

216
00:11:53.206 --> 00:11:57.486
There's something powerful in what Dee Hock has

217
00:11:57.486 --> 00:12:01.066
uncovered and I'm pleased to have used

218
00:12:01.066 --> 00:12:05.236
an interview of his as an appendix.

219
00:12:05.666 --> 00:12:07.796
<v ->Yes, I saw that.</v>

220
00:12:07.866 --> 00:12:10.046
What is the name of, is there, you want to...

221
00:12:10.046 --> 00:12:13.226
tell at this point, what the name of or has he written

222
00:12:13.226 --> 00:12:15.406
an article or book on what he has discovered or

223
00:12:15.406 --> 00:12:17.406
<v ->I couldn't tell you offhand.
<v ->do you know offhand?</v>

224
00:12:17.406 --> 00:12:19.746
Well we'll dig around a little bit and if it's available

225
00:12:19.746 --> 00:12:22.446
we'll put it up on your page here.

226
00:12:23.626 --> 00:12:27.130
And so this flexibility is something that has to permeate

227
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.850
and it permeates the need for it.

228
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.570
It permeates not just organizations but within

229
00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.190
our own being in times like this.

230
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.170
It seems that flexibility, this kind of flexibility,

231
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.770
is what's most needed and yet at the same time

232
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.930
when we feel the pressure upon us with everything changing

233
00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.990
so rapidly, we want to dig our heels in and become

234
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:52.530
entrenched in old familiar belief systems and habits.

235
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.950
So how do we break out of that because I think

236
00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.090
a lot of people are finding themselves there,

237
00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.020
how do they move to the flexible?

238
00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.240
<v ->That's a great question.</v>

239
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.910
One of the things I think I've successfully done in my book

240
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:08.910
is created a grounded interpretation of unconditional love.

241
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:13.510
Unconditional love is the only way out.

242
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:17.092
We have to learn about how our realities come to be,

243
00:13:17.092 --> 00:13:20.132
the part we play in it, we can then look at our neighbors

244
00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:22.012
and watch them in their reality creating

245
00:13:22.012 --> 00:13:24.592
an understanding that they're young creators.

246
00:13:24.592 --> 00:13:27.332
They're coming kind of low on the scale of the process

247
00:13:27.332 --> 00:13:29.752
but, you know, resistance we used to,

248
00:13:29.752 --> 00:13:32.992
you know, be the food of dinosaurs not that many years ago

249
00:13:32.992 --> 00:13:35.472
and so we're evolving very rapidly but

250
00:13:35.472 --> 00:13:38.452
resistance is a big part and it's natural

251
00:13:38.452 --> 00:13:41.972
and it's alternative is unconditional love.

252
00:13:41.972 --> 00:13:45.432
<v ->It's fear-based survival mechanism, right?</v>

253
00:13:45.432 --> 00:13:48.652
<v ->So what we need to do is simply go passed that and</v>

254
00:13:48.652 --> 00:13:53.172
unconditional love is an understanding that actually

255
00:13:53.172 --> 00:13:56.472
well go back to the chaos and order example.

256
00:13:56.472 --> 00:13:58.352
If you don't have enough perspective

257
00:13:58.352 --> 00:14:00.332
you're going to see chaos, if you have enough

258
00:14:00.332 --> 00:14:02.112
perspective you're going to see order.

259
00:14:02.112 --> 00:14:05.472
And in this capacity for seeing order, your capacity to

260
00:14:05.472 --> 00:14:09.712
show and express unconditional love becomes very available.

261
00:14:09.712 --> 00:14:13.232
And there's an exponential multiplier when

262
00:14:13.232 --> 00:14:15.652
you're operating from unconditional love

263
00:14:15.652 --> 00:14:17.972
versus, there's not even a comparison.

264
00:14:17.972 --> 00:14:20.112
<v ->Absolutely, the multiplier.
<v ->There's no scale.</v>

265
00:14:20.112 --> 00:14:22.152
<v ->You mentioned something in your book, and I don't know</v>

266
00:14:22.152 --> 00:14:24.672
if we were at the same lecture by Patrick Flannigan,

267
00:14:24.672 --> 00:14:29.052
but he was doing some experiments using EKG machines,

268
00:14:30.462 --> 00:14:34.420
having to do with the resonance of one person's heart

269
00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.700
and then having two people hooked up.

270
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.040
And another person in another room doing their own thing,

271
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.080
chatting with people, unaware of what would be going on.

272
00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.580
Watching what happened between their hearts when you had

273
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.640
one projecting unconditional love to the other less aware

274
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.940
of the situation individual and it truly is profound.

275
00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.300
And I know you wrote a bit about that as well,

276
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.120
would you care to talk about it?

277
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.120
<v ->You know, from the perspective of, everybody knows</v>

278
00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.500
who Dr David Hawkins is, and "Power Versus Force"

279
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.940
was a very powerfully and timely book.

280
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.560
And one of the things he capably displays is

281
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.540
what's called a map of consciousness.

282
00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.540
And the map of consciousness is a scale of 0 to 1000

283
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.080
with 0 to 200 being the low end of the scale,

284
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.620
700 to 1000 being the upper end of the scale.

285
00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.920
700 to 1000 being the states of enlightenment

286
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.700
and actually 0 to 175 being the states of angst,

287
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.090
anger, jealousy, rage and all the lower

288
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.094
types of emotion or existence.

289
00:15:40.094 --> 00:15:43.694
And what's interesting is the break point is at 200

290
00:15:43.694 --> 00:15:46.994
which is courage, in fact pride is at 175

291
00:15:46.994 --> 00:15:51.014
and courage is at 200 and so, what we're having to learn

292
00:15:51.014 --> 00:15:54.134
how to do is move out of our habitual patterns which is

293
00:15:54.134 --> 00:15:57.474
our comfort wherever we are and it takes courage to do that

294
00:15:57.474 --> 00:16:00.274
and we start working our way up the scale.

295
00:16:01.864 --> 00:16:05.614
From there, we learn how to, there's an exponential

296
00:16:05.614 --> 00:16:09.094
multiplier that becomes available as we move up the scale

297
00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:13.564
and our capacity to be influential becomes much greater.

298
00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:18.778
<v ->Unconditional love, going back to unconditional love,</v>

299
00:16:18.778 --> 00:16:21.678
it takes courage so you have to have already climbed up

300
00:16:21.678 --> 00:16:25.158
that scale a bit just to be able to access that aspect of

301
00:16:25.158 --> 00:16:28.658
self that can go into the field of unconditional love

302
00:16:28.658 --> 00:16:31.818
especially in the face of challenges

303
00:16:31.818 --> 00:16:34.618
and people's situations it challenges.

304
00:16:34.618 --> 00:16:36.978
Can you comment on that a little bit more.

305
00:16:36.978 --> 00:16:39.248
<v ->So let's say that</v>

306
00:16:41.278 --> 00:16:44.598
when you're acting out of reaction,

307
00:16:44.598 --> 00:16:49.598
clearly you are taking in an energy, you're mixing it

308
00:16:50.238 --> 00:16:52.838
with the power that you are, even though much of it

309
00:16:52.838 --> 00:16:56.688
unconsciousness and you're spilling it back out.

310
00:16:57.818 --> 00:17:00.398
All you're doing is repeating, in fact, that goes on a lot.

311
00:17:00.398 --> 00:17:03.478
Somebody will be in a disagreement with somebody

312
00:17:03.478 --> 00:17:05.838
and they will argue with each other and they generated

313
00:17:05.838 --> 00:17:08.758
a whole energetic which is, and they break from that

314
00:17:08.758 --> 00:17:11.920
and usually they've wrecked the rest of their day.

315
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.000
<v ->Right, very true.</v>

316
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.260
<v ->So, when you learn how to move up the scale and</v>

317
00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.440
courage is that secret, it's I think much of what doctor,

318
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.120
well I shouldn't say much but what Dr. David Hawkins did

319
00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.120
was unleash this concept of courage

320
00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.900
and your ability to move up the scale.

321
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.640
Now the way I see it, as you move up the scale

322
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.400
reason, and I wish I had the map or I could be more eloquent

323
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:40.020
in the gradients of it, as you move up the scale

324
00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.504
the power of the universe flows with you because you

325
00:17:44.504 --> 00:17:48.534
tend to mesh and merge with universal forces.

326
00:17:48.624 --> 00:17:51.024
Obviously universal forces aren't going to flow through you

327
00:17:51.024 --> 00:17:53.464
very powerfully when you're in anger or jealousy

328
00:17:53.464 --> 00:17:57.624
or resentment, but when you move up the scale into

329
00:17:57.624 --> 00:18:02.624
reason, joy, unconditional love, the capacity to influence

330
00:18:03.184 --> 00:18:07.724
your outcomes and secondarily others, you can't

331
00:18:07.724 --> 00:18:12.064
really influence other people but you can support them

332
00:18:12.064 --> 00:18:16.694
by not supporting the resistant operation they're in.

333
00:18:16.904 --> 00:18:19.564
So sometimes you love people and you let them go

334
00:18:19.564 --> 00:18:23.584
but at the very least, when you love somebody you've

335
00:18:23.584 --> 00:18:27.104
stopped the process that otherwise in resistance

336
00:18:27.104 --> 00:18:31.864
would create a ball of energy that, actually the planet

337
00:18:31.864 --> 00:18:33.904
doesn't have much of a place for it anymore,

338
00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:36.104
we need to learn how to go beyond that.

339
00:18:36.104 --> 00:18:39.544
<v ->And this brings us into the laws of attraction.</v>

340
00:18:39.544 --> 00:18:43.204
If you're flowing more with the universal energies,

341
00:18:43.204 --> 00:18:45.444
then you're really much more open to

342
00:18:45.444 --> 00:18:49.544
creating from the point of the basic

343
00:18:49.544 --> 00:18:51.804
laws of attraction, like attracts like.

344
00:18:51.804 --> 00:18:54.384
Is that right? Is that, that's a big part of it?

345
00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:57.064
<v ->Yes, so the word comes to mind, synchronicities.</v>

346
00:18:57.064 --> 00:19:00.244
Echoes of an interactive universe, as we learn to understand

347
00:19:00.244 --> 00:19:03.944
the law of attraction and deliberate creation is

348
00:19:03.944 --> 00:19:06.804
the intentional use of law of attraction,

349
00:19:08.414 --> 00:19:13.005
our capacity to be influential, the new term I like is

350
00:19:13.005 --> 00:19:16.705
called usefully influential, becomes substantially greater.

351
00:19:16.705 --> 00:19:21.705
As we line up our energies, basically what we're doing is

352
00:19:22.085 --> 00:19:24.905
we climb the scale we're moving toward

353
00:19:24.905 --> 00:19:28.525
harmonizing with universal forces.

354
00:19:28.525 --> 00:19:31.925
That's what enlightenment would be, be the states of that

355
00:19:31.925 --> 00:19:34.025
and I'm sure it goes further but

356
00:19:34.025 --> 00:19:39.025
so in our reality creating as we can use law of attraction

357
00:19:39.695 --> 00:19:41.985
and there's another aspect of that and it's called

358
00:19:41.985 --> 00:19:44.085
what I call underlying quality of intent.

359
00:19:44.085 --> 00:19:46.705
It's actually what I've created as a formula.

360
00:19:46.705 --> 00:19:48.825
Focus, an underlying quality of intent.

361
00:19:48.825 --> 00:19:50.725
And the underlying quality of intent

362
00:19:50.725 --> 00:19:52.985
actually dictates the amount of universal

363
00:19:52.985 --> 00:19:55.925
forces that come into your reality creating.

364
00:19:55.925 --> 00:19:59.425
And as the scale goes up, the synchronicities,

365
00:19:59.425 --> 00:20:02.565
the lining up, it's like I remarked yesterday.

366
00:20:02.565 --> 00:20:06.085
My day went together like a jigsaw puzzle and

367
00:20:06.085 --> 00:20:08.585
the pieces solidly snapping together

368
00:20:08.585 --> 00:20:11.165
one at a time as the day went forward.

369
00:20:11.165 --> 00:20:14.605
It's intentional reality creation, it's the law

370
00:20:14.605 --> 00:20:17.365
of attraction, it's what we learn how to

371
00:20:17.365 --> 00:20:19.805
harness as we become more conscious.

372
00:20:19.805 --> 00:20:22.945
We see the benefits of it, the value is there and we

373
00:20:22.945 --> 00:20:25.805
continue to refine ourselves so there's your out of

374
00:20:25.805 --> 00:20:29.425
contrast comes clarity bumped up the scale quite a bit.

375
00:20:29.425 --> 00:20:31.765
<v ->What do you mean when you're talking about the quality</v>

376
00:20:31.765 --> 00:20:33.665
of the intent because that sounds like that's

377
00:20:33.665 --> 00:20:35.485
really the key word in that formula.

378
00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:38.145
<v ->Okay, so let's say revenge, somebody's</v>

379
00:20:38.145 --> 00:20:40.465
going to get even with somebody.

380
00:20:40.465 --> 00:20:43.685
A lot of focus and the underlying quality of intent is

381
00:20:43.685 --> 00:20:48.685
not so hot, and so, and lawfully so, I mean it doesn't

382
00:20:48.785 --> 00:20:51.085
serve the universe, it doesn't serve anybody except for

383
00:20:51.085 --> 00:20:53.965
the contrast but there's no exponential multiplier.

384
00:20:56.895 --> 00:20:59.725
So the map of consciousness is important, it shows us

385
00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:02.705
underlying quality of intent in the map of consciousness

386
00:21:02.705 --> 00:21:06.205
which I describe in my book, but as we go up

387
00:21:06.205 --> 00:21:11.205
the underlying quality of intent is the catalyst associated

388
00:21:12.166 --> 00:21:17.166
with focus to bring not only higher quality reality but

389
00:21:17.545 --> 00:21:21.865
the universe flowing through us in our reality creating.

390
00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:24.465
I talk about it as a kind of glue

391
00:21:24.465 --> 00:21:26.806
holding our realities together.

392
00:21:26.806 --> 00:21:30.245
When we are creating realities at the lower levels,

393
00:21:30.245 --> 00:21:34.466
the glue that holds our realities together is very poor.

394
00:21:34.466 --> 00:21:38.285
As we get into alignment with universal forces which is

395
00:21:38.285 --> 00:21:41.925
a product of underlying quality of intent and law

396
00:21:41.925 --> 00:21:44.765
of attraction, the glue gets better.

397
00:21:44.765 --> 00:21:48.145
In fact, I would suggest that most of reality creating

398
00:21:48.145 --> 00:21:51.046
has done at a very low level and therefore,

399
00:21:51.046 --> 00:21:55.305
it is was for the perception and the taking it in

400
00:21:55.305 --> 00:21:58.245
and kicking it back out, I'm sure that reality as

401
00:21:58.245 --> 00:22:00.386
humans have created it would just go back to dust

402
00:22:00.386 --> 00:22:02.906
because it doesn't serve but at a minimal level.

403
00:22:02.906 --> 00:22:05.965
But as we start learning how to create with

404
00:22:05.965 --> 00:22:08.665
love as an exponential multiplier,

405
00:22:08.665 --> 00:22:12.885
since the reality that we have now is barely held together

406
00:22:12.885 --> 00:22:15.745
the ability to replace it with something much more

407
00:22:15.745 --> 00:22:18.666
substantial is very readily available and I think

408
00:22:18.666 --> 00:22:21.646
we'll actually see the world change in a

409
00:22:21.646 --> 00:22:23.445
twinkling of an eye because of this

410
00:22:23.445 --> 00:22:26.225
exponential multiplier that becomes available.

411
00:22:26.225 --> 00:22:29.165
<v ->The tipping, that creates in essence a tipping point.</v>

412
00:22:29.165 --> 00:22:32.145
<v ->Yes, yes, and it's exponential. It's not a one on one.</v>

413
00:22:32.145 --> 00:22:35.305
Even Dr. Hawkins would tell you there's a big difference

414
00:22:35.305 --> 00:22:37.705
between 200 and 201.
<v ->Right.</v>

415
00:22:37.705 --> 00:22:41.525
<v ->Much less, 200 and 220 or 200 and 550.</v>

416
00:22:41.525 --> 00:22:46.125
So there's a huge amount of universal forces at our

417
00:22:46.125 --> 00:22:50.945
beck and call as we learn to line up with what's real

418
00:22:50.945 --> 00:22:55.406
and move into these upper scale qualities of intent.

419
00:22:55.406 --> 00:22:58.585
<v ->Once you have your quality of intent there,</v>

420
00:22:58.585 --> 00:23:01.885
often times people say, okay I'm going to envision what

421
00:23:01.885 --> 00:23:04.605
I want, I really really want this to happen.

422
00:23:04.605 --> 00:23:08.185
But then as soon as it's over, their little vision or

423
00:23:08.185 --> 00:23:11.007
meditation, the fear starts seeping in.

424
00:23:11.007 --> 00:23:13.586
Oh I don't think I can really, it couldn't happen that fast.

425
00:23:13.586 --> 00:23:15.906
It couldn't happen like that, and then

426
00:23:15.906 --> 00:23:20.026
that basically knocks out the power of allowing

427
00:23:20.026 --> 00:23:23.606
because there seems to be a state of grace and quietude

428
00:23:23.606 --> 00:23:27.546
and faith of sorts and then allowing that intention,

429
00:23:27.546 --> 00:23:31.106
allowing the forces to multiply and gather to create

430
00:23:31.106 --> 00:23:33.567
the end result, is that not right?

431
00:23:33.567 --> 00:23:37.947
<v ->So what I've come to see is that the higher your</v>

432
00:23:37.947 --> 00:23:40.966
underlying quality of intent, the higher your

433
00:23:40.966 --> 00:23:44.866
capacity to interface the universal forces,

434
00:23:44.866 --> 00:23:48.656
the less specific your focus is.

435
00:23:49.166 --> 00:23:52.186
So when you're focusing on a new red car,

436
00:23:52.186 --> 00:23:55.426
you know, you've got a lot tied into it and then you can

437
00:23:55.426 --> 00:23:58.047
say you can focus on a new red car from the perspective

438
00:23:58.047 --> 00:24:00.786
of unconditional love but you'll discover if that's the case

439
00:24:00.786 --> 00:24:02.986
because if the fear and the doubt shows up,

440
00:24:02.986 --> 00:24:05.347
you obviously haven't quite made it.

441
00:24:05.347 --> 00:24:09.946
But it's true that as we become more in alignment

442
00:24:09.946 --> 00:24:13.347
with our own nature, our creating becomes

443
00:24:13.347 --> 00:24:16.446
more generalized because it's got to.

444
00:24:16.446 --> 00:24:19.407
If we universal forces kicking in and contributing to

445
00:24:19.407 --> 00:24:22.347
our reality creation, we need to kind of start

446
00:24:22.347 --> 00:24:25.327
defining what we want a little bit less.

447
00:24:25.327 --> 00:24:28.686
And I made a remark that goals are becoming obsolete

448
00:24:28.686 --> 00:24:32.467
because they often come from the perspective of what we want

449
00:24:32.467 --> 00:24:35.227
but we want often comes from the perspective of

450
00:24:35.227 --> 00:24:39.267
the dysfunctional nature, or dysfunctional natures.

451
00:24:39.267 --> 00:24:42.327
And so what I suggested in this article,

452
00:24:42.327 --> 00:24:44.687
and I think it all fit in a set of parenthesis

453
00:24:44.687 --> 00:24:47.706
is that goals are being replaced by intent.

454
00:24:47.706 --> 00:24:52.266
Intent is far more powerful, it's actually far more general,

455
00:24:52.266 --> 00:24:56.507
and it has a capacity to allow universal forces to flow

456
00:24:56.507 --> 00:25:01.046
through and clearly unconditional love to your surroundings

457
00:25:01.046 --> 00:25:04.167
is clearly more an intent rather than a fact.

458
00:25:04.167 --> 00:25:08.626
And I know that goals can be, in fact goals should actually

459
00:25:08.626 --> 00:25:10.726
be how you want to feel if you really want

460
00:25:10.726 --> 00:25:13.566
to have a successful goal.
<v ->Exactly. Exactly.</v>

461
00:25:13.566 --> 00:25:16.426
<v ->And then you add the that underlying quality of intent and</v>

462
00:25:16.426 --> 00:25:19.307
you know, they're actually starting to merge a little bit.

463
00:25:19.307 --> 00:25:21.906
But clearly the more focused your goal the less

464
00:25:21.906 --> 00:25:24.487
likely they can actually pull universal

465
00:25:24.487 --> 00:25:27.547
forces through you, I would say.

466
00:25:27.547 --> 00:25:29.687
<v ->Yeah, that is so true in that it's the difference</v>

467
00:25:29.687 --> 00:25:34.187
between getting out the laundry list for your goal setting.

468
00:25:34.187 --> 00:25:39.187
I really want to have my red car and I'd like to have it by

469
00:25:39.426 --> 00:25:43.586
the end of September and I want a really hot girlfriend,

470
00:25:43.586 --> 00:25:45.907
really hot girlfriend who likes all the same stuff that I

471
00:25:45.907 --> 00:25:50.026
like, and on and on and on, and I'd really like to have more

472
00:25:50.026 --> 00:25:52.867
respect in my job, but in fact what does one

473
00:25:52.867 --> 00:25:56.406
really want except to feel that wonderful lightness

474
00:25:56.406 --> 00:25:59.906
of being, connectivity, productivity.

475
00:25:59.906 --> 00:26:02.066
And so you're saying move away from that

476
00:26:02.066 --> 00:26:04.886
first list and go toward the feeling,

477
00:26:04.886 --> 00:26:07.647
the intention of the feeling and

478
00:26:07.647 --> 00:26:10.247
experience of the other way.

479
00:26:10.247 --> 00:26:13.447
<v ->Certainly that's an evolvement of the new hub caps</v>

480
00:26:13.447 --> 00:26:15.887
for your car, the new red car or whatever it is, because

481
00:26:15.887 --> 00:26:17.946
we all started there, I think we all did.

482
00:26:17.946 --> 00:26:19.387
<v ->Sure.</v>

483
00:26:19.387 --> 00:26:22.566
<v ->But how you feel is very valuable and,</v>

484
00:26:22.566 --> 00:26:25.467
I mean you can see how, what we need to learn how to do

485
00:26:25.467 --> 00:26:30.086
is embrace what is and it's in that that we get to practice

486
00:26:30.086 --> 00:26:32.846
allowing and we get to practice loving.

487
00:26:32.846 --> 00:26:36.067
And when we understand that our realities are a product

488
00:26:36.067 --> 00:26:39.026
of our beliefs and on and on, the only way we're going to

489
00:26:39.026 --> 00:26:41.648
escape them is to love them, it's really an important point.

490
00:26:41.648 --> 00:26:45.047
Certainly resistance is certainly choosing what you want

491
00:26:45.047 --> 00:26:48.468
based on what you don't want is not really part of

492
00:26:48.468 --> 00:26:51.108
the formula and much of your goal setting is choosing

493
00:26:51.108 --> 00:26:52.888
what you want based on what you don't want

494
00:26:52.888 --> 00:26:55.548
and you are actually dragging both along in your goals.

495
00:26:55.548 --> 00:26:56.887
<v ->The variety, sure.</v>

496
00:26:56.887 --> 00:26:59.768
<v ->So that's why we need to get more generalized in our goals</v>

497
00:26:59.768 --> 00:27:02.728
and bump our way up the map of consciousness, if you will

498
00:27:02.728 --> 00:27:06.408
and loving, I mean how in the world could Jesus or somebody,

499
00:27:06.408 --> 00:27:09.968
these different prophets and poets and, that have been

500
00:27:09.968 --> 00:27:13.708
through the past thousands of years,

501
00:27:13.708 --> 00:27:15.908
their message was always the same.

502
00:27:15.908 --> 00:27:17.468
And certainly it is not about resistance,

503
00:27:17.468 --> 00:27:19.127
it's about the opposite of that, right?

504
00:27:19.127 --> 00:27:21.148
And we love our way out of things.

505
00:27:21.148 --> 00:27:25.338
I think there was not too many years ago, months ago a...

506
00:27:29.608 --> 00:27:32.107
Well there was a big e-mail campaign to love

507
00:27:32.107 --> 00:27:34.088
the President of the United States.

508
00:27:34.088 --> 00:27:36.788
And I think it's a good exercise for humans.

509
00:27:36.788 --> 00:27:40.528
It's a really good exercise.
<v ->I agree, it is.</v>

510
00:27:40.528 --> 00:27:42.988
<v ->In the alternative we'd gnash our teeth and we</v>

511
00:27:42.988 --> 00:27:44.947
think about, I don't know, about getting even?

512
00:27:44.947 --> 00:27:47.088
We think about, you know, how to solve problems in

513
00:27:47.088 --> 00:27:50.568
this linear, we need to move nonlinear and become

514
00:27:50.568 --> 00:27:53.048
successful in it and if you think about the universe

515
00:27:53.048 --> 00:27:57.788
operates by unfolding and allowing.

516
00:27:57.788 --> 00:28:00.568
And if want in stuck with a true picture of success,

517
00:28:00.568 --> 00:28:03.068
i.e. the universe, we need to start mirroring

518
00:28:03.068 --> 00:28:05.447
and doing the same kind of thing.

519
00:28:05.447 --> 00:28:07.148
And that'd be the success of a species

520
00:28:07.148 --> 00:28:10.048
and a deserved success of a species.

521
00:28:10.048 --> 00:28:12.488
<v ->And we're not talking about sentimental love here.</v>

522
00:28:12.488 --> 00:28:13.448
<v ->No.</v>

523
00:28:13.448 --> 00:28:15.448
<v ->We're talking about a love that is</v>

524
00:28:15.448 --> 00:28:20.228
the fabric of the universe and it's identified in,

525
00:28:20.228 --> 00:28:24.428
how would you describe it in terms of identifying how

526
00:28:24.428 --> 00:28:27.978
a person knows when they're in that place versus the other?

527
00:28:29.447 --> 00:28:31.028
<v ->You mean, the lust?</v>

528
00:28:31.028 --> 00:28:32.528
(laughs)

529
00:28:32.528 --> 00:28:34.068
Well I think that's even to tell.

530
00:28:34.068 --> 00:28:36.288
<v ->Well even sentimental love for a family member</v>

531
00:28:36.288 --> 00:28:37.488
<v ->No, you're right.</v>

532
00:28:37.488 --> 00:28:39.168
<v ->is very different than universal love.</v>

533
00:28:39.168 --> 00:28:41.449
<v ->Well universal love is first off, I think you can find it</v>

534
00:28:41.449 --> 00:28:44.569
with sentimental love but yes, truly its several octaves up

535
00:28:44.569 --> 00:28:47.828
and unconditional love is really an acceptance

536
00:28:47.828 --> 00:28:52.199
of whatever's going on because it is in order.

537
00:28:52.329 --> 00:28:56.389
What appears to be chaos is in fact a lack of perception

538
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:59.189
and when you have that perception, when you're coming from

539
00:28:59.189 --> 00:29:02.969
unconditional love you have a perception that all is well.

540
00:29:02.969 --> 00:29:07.569
And in fact, all is well, and if you understand out of

541
00:29:07.569 --> 00:29:10.489
contrast comes clarity, humanity is moving along at the rate

542
00:29:10.489 --> 00:29:13.391
and speed that it is and if you can trust that process

543
00:29:13.391 --> 00:29:16.451
and love that process, guess what?

544
00:29:16.451 --> 00:29:19.331
There's an exponential multiplier in your influence

545
00:29:19.331 --> 00:29:22.450
and in not only your own reality creating because when you

546
00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.791
walk away from letting go and the next thing you do

547
00:29:24.791 --> 00:29:26.731
you carry that vibration with you.

548
00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:29.090
Your personal reality creating gets better,

549
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:32.751
you've blessed the world around you and one at a time,

550
00:29:32.751 --> 00:29:36.451
we make the world a better place and powerfully so.

551
00:29:36.451 --> 00:29:39.750
<v ->And going into that place of acceptance does not mean</v>

552
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:43.351
necessarily that can't progress from there either.

553
00:29:43.351 --> 00:29:46.411
It's, there's sometimes a debate among people in

554
00:29:46.411 --> 00:29:50.251
the various consciousness communities, yeah but

555
00:29:50.251 --> 00:29:52.671
you have to know the nuts and bolts and you have to take

556
00:29:52.671 --> 00:29:55.611
action in order to create the change we're looking for

557
00:29:55.611 --> 00:29:58.431
and the other group would say, no, everything is in

558
00:29:58.431 --> 00:30:02.151
divine order and meditate their way through, okay.

559
00:30:02.151 --> 00:30:04.771
But it's actually both are true.

560
00:30:04.771 --> 00:30:07.531
<v ->Well look at it this way, we are</v>

561
00:30:07.531 --> 00:30:09.550
a product of our momentum.

562
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.051
Our momentum is all the decisions we've made before us

563
00:30:12.051 --> 00:30:15.051
and it has a trajectory and in fact, we look at our

564
00:30:15.051 --> 00:30:18.131
trajectory as a species right now, it doesn't look so hot.

565
00:30:18.131 --> 00:30:21.171
And the only way out of that is to love it.

566
00:30:21.171 --> 00:30:23.890
So, there's people that want to go out there and be dynamic

567
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:25.931
and solve problems and often they're coming from

568
00:30:25.931 --> 00:30:28.131
a dysfunctional perspective of some sort, and I'm not

569
00:30:28.131 --> 00:30:30.350
picking on them, everybody does what they do and we

570
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:33.070
all contribute and it wouldn't be what it is if we

571
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:36.111
didn't all contribute, but in the end, the way

572
00:30:36.111 --> 00:30:40.171
we solve problems is by loving them.

573
00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:43.151
We have to love our momentum, we have to love our

574
00:30:43.151 --> 00:30:47.741
existing trajectory that's a product of our momentum and

575
00:30:47.741 --> 00:30:51.491
the only way we escape it or make it more is by loving it.

576
00:30:51.491 --> 00:30:53.411
<v ->And loving it has to do with, again, it's almost</v>

577
00:30:53.411 --> 00:30:58.191
interchangeable with true acceptance, true understanding.

578
00:30:58.191 --> 00:31:01.311
These are all parts of true love.

579
00:31:01.311 --> 00:31:05.371
<v ->I've with it a lot and allowing is a great word,</v>

580
00:31:05.371 --> 00:31:08.571
acceptance is a great word, they're all great,

581
00:31:08.571 --> 00:31:11.610
unconditional love, but allowing,

582
00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:15.031
when you really can't allow things to be the way they are

583
00:31:15.031 --> 00:31:19.650
we've come a long way and guess where we start allowing?

584
00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:23.391
With our own foibles, our own mistakes, our own errors.

585
00:31:23.391 --> 00:31:26.151
It's a very interesting, we're living in a very interesting

586
00:31:26.151 --> 00:31:29.751
time and place because the contrast is getting bigger,

587
00:31:29.751 --> 00:31:32.331
more and more people are becoming aware

588
00:31:32.331 --> 00:31:34.611
that there's a problem than ever before.

589
00:31:34.611 --> 00:31:36.851
Where in the old days, you simply followed the church

590
00:31:36.851 --> 00:31:39.711
or the state and they were the authority figures

591
00:31:39.711 --> 00:31:42.211
and you assumed they had their act together.

592
00:31:42.211 --> 00:31:46.051
We're now moving toward this individuality and discovering

593
00:31:46.051 --> 00:31:49.311
this innateness that we each have inside and it comes

594
00:31:49.311 --> 00:31:53.791
to us not by resistance, in fact resistance creates quite

595
00:31:53.791 --> 00:31:57.431
a ruckus in our lives and the lives of everyone around us.

596
00:31:57.431 --> 00:31:59.952
So we want to learn how to get inside and learn how to

597
00:31:59.952 --> 00:32:02.291
listen, well find everything's available

598
00:32:02.291 --> 00:32:05.161
to us that, excuse me, that way.

599
00:32:05.331 --> 00:32:08.172
<v ->Any final thoughts in pulling it all together,</v>

600
00:32:08.172 --> 00:32:10.451
which you just did really nicely by the way,

601
00:32:10.451 --> 00:32:14.431
but any final thoughts on visionaries thriving in our times?

602
00:32:14.431 --> 00:32:16.551
<v ->You know, I did have a remark I'd like to,</v>

603
00:32:16.551 --> 00:32:19.472
I have this idea that we have artificial entities on

604
00:32:19.472 --> 00:32:21.851
the planet and it's a strange term but it's interesting

605
00:32:21.851 --> 00:32:24.291
because we have corporations on the planet

606
00:32:24.291 --> 00:32:25.911
that have been here a long time.

607
00:32:25.911 --> 00:32:28.431
The United States of America has been here for 225 years.

608
00:32:28.431 --> 00:32:30.011
<v ->A corporation.
<v ->Yes it is.</v>

609
00:32:30.011 --> 00:32:32.012
It's a corporation, it's an artificial entity.

610
00:32:32.012 --> 00:32:33.711
And interestingly enough, and the church is kind of

611
00:32:33.711 --> 00:32:35.611
the same way, and I'm not picking on these guys because

612
00:32:35.611 --> 00:32:37.211
they're important, they've always been here.

613
00:32:37.211 --> 00:32:39.511
They've always been important, but interestingly

614
00:32:39.511 --> 00:32:41.592
enough an artificial entity, again

615
00:32:41.592 --> 00:32:44.491
a corporation, has no nervous system.

616
00:32:44.491 --> 00:32:47.531
It has no access to innate intelligence.

617
00:32:47.531 --> 00:32:51.351
It has no true access to decision making.

618
00:32:51.351 --> 00:32:53.571
See, when you make a decision there's

619
00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:56.071
always a feeling that goes with it.

620
00:32:56.071 --> 00:32:57.371
And when you're learning how to listen to

621
00:32:57.371 --> 00:32:59.291
the feeling that's inside of you,

622
00:32:59.291 --> 00:33:01.551
you can tell about the quality of your decision.

623
00:33:01.551 --> 00:33:03.791
Artificial entities don't have this.

624
00:33:03.791 --> 00:33:07.011
What's happened inadvertently is the artificial entities

625
00:33:07.011 --> 00:33:09.371
have become the leaders on the planet.

626
00:33:09.371 --> 00:33:11.131
<v ->This is so true.</v>

627
00:33:11.131 --> 00:33:13.231
<v ->And it's not serving the humans,</v>

628
00:33:13.231 --> 00:33:16.831
so my whole goal is to empower humans to discover

629
00:33:16.831 --> 00:33:20.751
who they are, find out what's inside of them, let it out,

630
00:33:20.751 --> 00:33:24.751
quit deferring to authority figures outside of themselves.

631
00:33:24.751 --> 00:33:28.291
As we discover who we are, we'll find our commonality,

632
00:33:28.291 --> 00:33:31.711
we'll find that we're all the same and I'd like

633
00:33:31.711 --> 00:33:34.511
to see the humans get back in charge of things.

634
00:33:37.614 --> 00:33:40.934
<v ->Jim's book is available by clicking on the link below.</v>

635
00:33:40.934 --> 00:33:43.235
Meanwhile, another interview along this line is with

636
00:33:43.235 --> 00:33:46.974
Michael Gelb who teaches us how to think like da Vinci,

637
00:33:46.974 --> 00:33:49.394
one of the world's greatest visionaries.

638
00:33:49.394 --> 00:33:52.744
Until next time, thanks for watching.
