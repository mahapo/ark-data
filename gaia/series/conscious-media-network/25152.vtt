00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>> In our last conversation
with Elena Tonetti-Vladimirova,

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.480 align:middle line:84%
we spoke of the profound
impact of the circumstances

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.740 align:middle line:84%
of our birth on the
rest of our lives.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.910 align:middle line:10%
But when we met, we began
chatting off camera,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.400 align:middle line:10%
and I asked her if, as
a native of Siberia,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.410 align:middle line:10%
if she was aware of
the Anastasia story.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Her face became
very quiet, and she

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.880 align:middle line:84%
said there was much
more to the story.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.750 align:middle line:84%
I had to know the
rest of the story,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.710 align:middle line:84%
so we put a tape in, and she
told us about what she feels

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.340 align:middle line:84%
was the inspiration for Vladimir
MegrÃ©'s series of books about

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:90%
a woman named Anastasia.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.255 align:middle line:10%
The books became known as
the "Ringing Cedar" series.

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:42.040 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm happy for this
opportunity to speak about it,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.170 align:middle line:84%
because usually at the
conferences and workshops,

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm focused on what I'm doing.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And here, we can
just have a lovely--

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Conversation.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>> --frank-- yeah.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to send the
message out there.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.470 align:middle line:90%
The books are--

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>> First of all, you're from--

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.455 align:middle line:90%
>> I am from Siberia.

00:01:02.455 --> 00:01:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And what is the
name of the village?

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The name of
the-- it's the city.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:90%
It's called Yekaterinburg.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And in those times when
the whole story began,

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.590 align:middle line:90%
it was called Sverdlovsk.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>> "Svetlovska."

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Sverdlovsk.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Sverdlovsk.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Sverdlovsk.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.440 align:middle line:84%
But now since perestroika,
they renamed everything,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.440 align:middle line:84%
so it's called
Yekaterinburg now.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.010 align:middle line:90%


00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So the whole story began
in 1972 with a group

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.570 align:middle line:84%
of five men, young graduates
from university in Sverdlovsk.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:90%
They were physicists.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
time when they all

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.850 align:middle line:84%
got married at the same time,
and their wives got pregnant,

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:90%
and they wanted a place to live.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.980 align:middle line:84%
At that time, the
housing shortage

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:90%
was so severe in Russia.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.800 align:middle line:84%
It was all allocated
by the government.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.139 align:middle line:84%
And people had to wait
for dozens of years

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and be, you know, in line
at their plant or factory

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.600 align:middle line:84%
and have to work in that
same place in order to--

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.840 align:middle line:84%
for their turn to
come up to receive

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.860 align:middle line:90%
that government-allocated flat.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.250 align:middle line:84%
So these kids decided to
do something about it,

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't want to
live in the same apartment

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.300 align:middle line:90%
with their grandparents.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, apartment is
that size, of course, you know?

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.460 align:middle line:90%
It was really tight in there.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So the whole story began from
these young families just

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:90%
wanting a place to live.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And they came up with
this amazing, amazing

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.100 align:middle line:90%
just phantom exchange.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.820 align:middle line:90%
They would just bluff.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:84%
They would go to the factory
and say, if you give us workers,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.010 align:middle line:84%
we will give you 10 apartments
in the future building.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.010 align:middle line:84%
They would go to a
different factory

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and say, if you
give us machinery,

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.010 align:middle line:84%
we will give you 15 apartments
in the next building

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.890 align:middle line:90%
that we're building.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.190 align:middle line:84%
So they created this phantom
promise of the future building

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:90%
of many apartments.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.540 align:middle line:90%
That's the only kind there was.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And lots of factories and
plants forwarded their forces,

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.380 align:middle line:84%
equipment there, everything
under the future promise

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.250 align:middle line:90%
of these apartments.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Because in Russia,
there was no houses.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.010 align:middle line:84%
It was only those big,
huge barracks, you know?

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like, all 11
time zones in Russia.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.460 align:middle line:84%
It's those five
types of barracks.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Efficient housing.

00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:46.135 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:46.970 align:middle line:90%
Efficient housing.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.920 align:middle line:90%
So they got it.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.920 align:middle line:90%
They did it.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.720 align:middle line:90%
They did it.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.340 align:middle line:84%
The first building was built.
But as they were doing it,

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.840 align:middle line:90%
the whole team came into place.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Like, brainstorming team.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.090 align:middle line:84%
So they started with five
people, but by the time

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.100 align:middle line:84%
the first building was finished,
the team was over 5,000.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And they just decided
to keep going.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Let's just keep going.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And they built the whole
village in the outskirts

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.240 align:middle line:90%
of Yekaterinburg.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.530 align:middle line:84%
The city government just gave
them a big chunk of land,

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and they developed
it completely.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I have the
whole story on my website.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:84%
It's called How
Dreams Come True.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.960 align:middle line:90%
So anybody can read--

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Look at how that
village came to be.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> But at some point, there
was already 30,000 people.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Actually over 30,000 people.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And when the buildings
were in place

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.600 align:middle line:84%
and the team was still a very
well loved, brainstorming

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.440 align:middle line:84%
mechanism of brilliant,
intelligent, very

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.920 align:middle line:84%
capable young people, they
thought, what's the next thing?

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Now that we have the roof over
our head, what do we do next?

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And in Russia, there is
this institution of dachas.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.160 align:middle line:90%
Family has a dacha.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:84%
It's very simple, because
villages were destroyed.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And all the villages were
running away into the city.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's just those
dilapidated country houses.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.110 align:middle line:84%
So any family, for
about a monthly salary,

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.540 align:middle line:90%
could afford buying this shack.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>> A little shack with land.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>> With land.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the thing, with land.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And they would fix it
up to their own liking,

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.310 align:middle line:84%
to their own capacity, and just
play with the dirt, you know?

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.580 align:middle line:90%
Get your fingers in the dirt.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is where you go on
weekends or maybe for a part

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.060 align:middle line:90%
of your summer vacation.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Weekends, I was
sent all my childhood.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.300 align:middle line:84%
That's where I spent all my
summer and winter breaks,

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.460 align:middle line:84%
with my grandmother and all the
other little kids, you know,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.880 align:middle line:84%
sent away from the
city to this place.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.980 align:middle line:84%
But this community, they
were basically all graduates

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.060 align:middle line:84%
from Yekaterinburg
University, colleges.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.500 align:middle line:84%
All their families
were somewhere else,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.260 align:middle line:84%
so they didn't really have
that institution of babushkas

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.950 align:middle line:90%
to play with their kids.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And they all started
having children,

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.180 align:middle line:84%
because now that they
had a place of their own,

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.070 align:middle line:90%
they just wanted to have babies.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Because normally, Russian
family has just one child,

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and here they have two,
three, four children.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was because of the
limitation of space for one,

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.620 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.820 align:middle line:84%
There is physically
nowhere to put the crib.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, you can't really be
homeless in Siberia in winter,

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.620 align:middle line:84%
so you have to have a physical
square footage to put that

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.920 align:middle line:90%
baby.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:84%
So I growing up never even
knew anybody who had siblings.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And then that
community, all of a sudden,

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.510 align:middle line:90%
there is baby boom.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.240 align:middle line:90%
And when those kids grew up--

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and some of them
already had kids,

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.290 align:middle line:90%
you know, out of 30,000 people.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:14.980 align:middle line:84%
So the basic population of
children in the community

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.630 align:middle line:90%
was in their teens.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.290 align:middle line:84%
They bought a whole village
and gave that village

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.680 align:middle line:84%
as a project to
teenagers to play with.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:90%
Just--

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.480 align:middle line:90%
--here.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:90%
Do with it what you want.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is
that nobody really

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:84%
knew how to grow anything,
how to live on the land,

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:84%
because it was already a
few generations of people

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.530 align:middle line:84%
completely disconnected
through revolution,

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.490 align:middle line:84%
through World War I, World
War II, Stalin's repressions.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Basically, everybody
who knew who

00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:00.640 align:middle line:84%
had the wisdom, the deep
connection with the nature,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:07.440 align:middle line:84%
with the dirt, you know, that
kind of dirt that grows things,

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.880 align:middle line:90%
they were gone.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.780 align:middle line:90%
They were gone.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.110 align:middle line:84%
It was a whole generation
of people in Russia

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.210 align:middle line:84%
who did not know
how to grow food.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So basically, those
kids were coming up

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.310 align:middle line:84%
with all these wonderful
and beautiful ideas.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:30.870 align:middle line:84%
How to talk to seeds,
how to make them

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.299 align:middle line:84%
work, because the
seeds were ruined.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:38.400 align:middle line:84%
The whole agriculture
was in pieces in Russia.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:44.550 align:middle line:84%
All these years, the
Siberian agriculture

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.200 align:middle line:90%
was governed from Moscow.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.270 align:middle line:84%
So from Moscow, they
would get a signal

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:84%
when to plant, when to harvest,
when to pull the weeds.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Were they supplied the
seeds by the government?

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.160 align:middle line:90%
Or was it still--

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, no.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.310 align:middle line:90%
It was all government.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.510 align:middle line:90%
Owned government.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So everybody was working
for the government and--

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Growing the same varieties,
the same kind of crops.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And the crops were
basically destroyed

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.750 align:middle line:84%
through the Khrushchev
era when he just decided

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.160 align:middle line:90%
to grow corn everywhere.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Khrushchev.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.850 align:middle line:90%
In the US, I think--

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:16.650 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Our pronunciation, "crew-shev,"
just in case anyone

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.030 align:middle line:90%
doesn't understand that.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:20.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.530 align:middle line:84%
The culture of growing
food was destroyed.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So of course, those teenagers
had adult supervision

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.740 align:middle line:84%
to help them know how
to work the power tools,

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.960 align:middle line:84%
how to build things,
how to fix the houses.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.930 align:middle line:84%
But basically,
they were designing

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.260 align:middle line:84%
a way of living together,
living on Earth,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:48.080 align:middle line:84%
and coming up with amazing
stories over the campfire.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And you know, all this was
part of their dream world

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:90%
that they were creating.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.550 align:middle line:84%
So actually, my
first documentary

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.370 align:middle line:84%
is called "How
Dreams Come True."

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:03.240 align:middle line:84%
The text on my website is the
script for that documentary.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.660 align:middle line:90%


00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:12.060 align:middle line:84%
So when I got
involved, it was '85.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So much later when
all the buildings

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.570 align:middle line:90%
were in place already.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:20.340 align:middle line:84%
I was at that time working in
Moscow with Igor Charkovsky,

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.760 align:middle line:84%
the pioneer of the
water birth concept,

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:29.280 align:middle line:84%
working with babies and
mamas and discovering how we

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.040 align:middle line:90%
can minimize the birth trauma.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.600 align:middle line:84%
But my husband was the
leader of this movement

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.270 align:middle line:90%
that was called the game.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:45.910 align:middle line:84%
the game was a
brainstorming technology.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.120 align:middle line:84%
He worked with big
organizations and institutions.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.100 align:middle line:84%
The average size of participants
in the game was 300.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And it goes for seven
days, somewhere out

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:01.810 align:middle line:84%
of town in some kind of
really secluded area.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And who participates
in the game?

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Organizations.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.140 align:middle line:84%
It was different organizations
all over the country

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.630 align:middle line:84%
where we're traveling
all the time,

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:84%
that we're ordering the game
as a way of finding solution.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Basically in Russia at
that time in the '80s,

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.950 align:middle line:84%
every single organization
was in deep, deep crisis.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Economical, political,
every which way.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to figure
out how to live, you know?

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.730 align:middle line:90%
How to survive as organization.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:40.450 align:middle line:84%
So they would order this
game that basically it

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:44.020 align:middle line:84%
started as a
business game, but it

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:49.750 align:middle line:84%
became more and more of a big
therapy session, you know?

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.690 align:middle line:84%
With the whole organization
that involves 300 people.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you work
with the organization,

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.950 align:middle line:84%
you can't help notice
that it's not just

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.160 align:middle line:90%
the organization's people.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:84%
So very fast, it moved from
just the business kind of game

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:84%
into what I call
the Magic Theater.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.760 align:middle line:84%
It was actually an
amazing experience.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And we were conducting at
least two games a month all

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.660 align:middle line:90%
over the country.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.730 align:middle line:84%
So it takes a week
to prepare, a week

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.340 align:middle line:90%
to play, a week to integrate--

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>> I have a question.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:90%
This is pre-perestroika.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And so how did the
government respond to the game?

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>> The government at this point
was in such overdrive that

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:84%
basically, we were doing
everything we wanted to do

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.780 align:middle line:90%
and got away with everything.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they had
other fish to fry.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>> There was no
rules against this.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.880 align:middle line:84%
They didn't come up
with rules against it.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Like, I was delivering
babies in the Black Sea

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.520 align:middle line:84%
with wild dolphins in
the middle of nowhere

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and getting away with that,
because there was no rules.

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:84%
There was no, you know, law
that you cannot do that,

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.350 align:middle line:84%
because that did not exist
as far as the government

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:10.790 align:middle line:90%
concerned.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And they were not looking
for the government permission

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.060 align:middle line:90%
at this point, you know?

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I just wondered if they
had heard wind of it and tried

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:20.570 align:middle line:90%
to stop it.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.670 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:90%
It never happened.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:27.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the last
games that I participated

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:33.470 align:middle line:84%
was ordered by Moscow municipal,
but by the mayor of Moscow.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:36.700 align:middle line:84%
So we played the game
with Moscow government.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.780 align:middle line:84%
That was probably the
fanciest game with best food--

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:41.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.540 align:middle line:90%
--ever.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And some profound effects
would come out of these games.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.365 align:middle line:90%
And it was spreading fast.

00:13:51.365 --> 00:13:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
that work also

00:13:54.680 --> 00:14:00.380 align:middle line:84%
was a big piece in taking
down that whole Soviet regime,

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:04.190 align:middle line:84%
because organizations
were really

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:09.890 align:middle line:84%
looking for something that
makes sense, and were refusing

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:13.020 align:middle line:90%
to do what didn't make sense.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:18.700 align:middle line:84%
So 10 years of that activity
really, really made a dent

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.560 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>> So you went to the mid '90s.

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:23.150 align:middle line:90%
No, from--

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I am still--

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.520 align:middle line:84%
with you, I am
still in mid '80s.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Mid '80s.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So at that time, the
community going back,

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.980 align:middle line:84%
it's like through me,
the two got married,

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:42.780 align:middle line:84%
that community building movement
and the work that my ex-husband

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:43.580 align:middle line:90%
was doing.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:44.570 align:middle line:90%
Well, late husband.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:48.500 align:middle line:90%
He died now.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So when the community
decided to build a school,

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.920 align:middle line:84%
they asked me, because they were
my friends from my hometown.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.130 align:middle line:90%
They knew what I'm doing.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And they asked me to
bring the whole team.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.350 align:middle line:90%
It was 16 people.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.260 align:middle line:84%
We called ourselves
game technicians.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.960 align:middle line:84%
It was this magic
theater kind of--

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:90%
we had a lot of fun doing it.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And they asked me
to come and help

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:20.120 align:middle line:84%
them understand, what's
the criteria for a school

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.520 align:middle line:90%
that they want?

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.710 align:middle line:84%
They were very clear about
what they don't want,

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:28.970 align:middle line:84%
that Soviet Bloc
that was so saturated

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.570 align:middle line:90%
by brainwashing in every word.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Lack of creativity.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.420 align:middle line:84%
So it was very clear to
them what they don't want.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.090 align:middle line:84%
But the project,
that game was called

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.720 align:middle line:90%
the School of the 21st Century.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Because in '85, it seemed
like the 21st century was

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:49.655 align:middle line:90%
300 years from now, you know?

00:15:49.655 --> 00:15:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Kind of a magic milestone.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.260 align:middle line:90%
It was this unattainable future.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.230 align:middle line:84%
But that's what the
name of the game was.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.420 align:middle line:90%
And the community participated.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.910 align:middle line:90%
There was about 200 people.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And we all flew
from Moscow, even

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:09.590 align:middle line:84%
though that was my-- you know, I
stayed at home with my parents.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:15.740 align:middle line:84%
But still, I was the
other one from the team

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.070 align:middle line:90%
in this community.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And as a result
of this community,

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:26.510 align:middle line:84%
it's just an amazing,
amazing unfolding

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.850 align:middle line:90%
that happened from that game.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.210 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the first water
birth center was created.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And they completely
received, absorbed,

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.190 align:middle line:84%
and took to their hearts
this whole approach

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:43.850 align:middle line:84%
of respecting babies and
knowing who babies are,

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.950 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
how to welcome them,

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.750 align:middle line:90%
how to prepare consciously.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:50.630 align:middle line:84%
So this whole piece of
conscious conception,

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.960 align:middle line:84%
conscious pregnancy,
and conscious birth,

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.750 align:middle line:84%
conscious parenting
before the school,

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:01.130 align:middle line:84%
because at that time
in Moscow, there

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:04.940 align:middle line:84%
was already this kind
of esoteric knowledge

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:10.710 align:middle line:84%
about all this that we were
building for a few years.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:14.520 align:middle line:84%
But generally in Russia
and especially in Siberia,

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.240 align:middle line:84%
babies were still treated like
everywhere else in the world,

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.489 align:middle line:84%
just like a piece of
unconscious flesh.

00:17:21.489 --> 00:17:24.089 align:middle line:90%


00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:90%
And birth was terrible.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.677 align:middle line:84%
Don't get me
started on this one.

00:17:27.677 --> 00:17:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>> But we'll talk about
that a little later.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:37.830 align:middle line:84%
So all of this information
was just instantly

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.280 align:middle line:84%
received by thousands
of people who

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:47.670 align:middle line:84%
had the brainstorming
mechanism of manifesting

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.660 align:middle line:90%
the idea into reality.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle line:84%
So the team from Moscow
met, that team in Siberia,

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.650 align:middle line:90%
and, choo!

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.380 align:middle line:84%
There came up this
amazing concept

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:07.320 align:middle line:84%
of the school of the pre-school
way of relating to children.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.180 align:middle line:90%
And it was all happening.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:16.170 align:middle line:84%
It was all sprouting so fast,
because that community became

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:21.466 align:middle line:84%
a very contagious
kind of entity.

00:18:21.466 --> 00:18:24.540 align:middle line:84%
In the early '80s there
were three books written

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.510 align:middle line:84%
about that in Russian,
but they were more

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.970 align:middle line:90%
like newspaper kind of account.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:30.900 align:middle line:90%
This is what happened.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.020 align:middle line:90%
This is who done it.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.350 align:middle line:84%
This is what, when,
how, you know?

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.540 align:middle line:90%
They're amazing books.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.650 align:middle line:90%
I can actually show you.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.015 align:middle line:90%
I have them all in my library.

00:18:39.015 --> 00:18:41.840 align:middle line:90%


00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And 324 communities
sprouted from this one.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Was this all over
Russia, including Siberia?

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.237 align:middle line:84%
All over Russia,
including Moscow.

00:18:55.237 --> 00:18:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Including Moscow.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.340 align:middle line:84%
There was four of
them in Moscow,

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.620 align:middle line:84%
and Moscow was the
hardest nut to crack,

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:07.290 align:middle line:84%
because it's so close to this
censorship kind of powers.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:12.150 align:middle line:84%
In Siberia, things were much
easier, because it was far.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And Boris Yeltsin was at that
time the mayor of our town.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And that community,
that very first one,

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:29.610 align:middle line:84%
created such an incredible
emotional, psychological

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:34.020 align:middle line:90%
landscape of success, you know?

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.280 align:middle line:90%
Social success.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.090 align:middle line:90%
Hope.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Housing shortage was solved
unprecedentedly in the county.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.980 align:middle line:84%
So he took all the credit
for that, of course.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And was instantly
promoted to Moscow--

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:49.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:90%
Politicians.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>> --where he took all the
credit and became president

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.080 align:middle line:90%
of Russia.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And yes, of course, he had to
sign all the papers for all

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.900 align:middle line:84%
of this to start happening,
but how he was made to sign all

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.860 align:middle line:90%
those papers, that's--

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, and there's
another story about how

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.920 align:middle line:84%
he was made president,
because a friend of ours

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.050 align:middle line:84%
was actually his
campaign manager.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's a movie, a Hollywood
movie called "Spinning Boris"

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.580 align:middle line:84%
that tells the entire back
story of how Boris was elected.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.090 align:middle line:90%
It is absolutely fascinating.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And now you're giving
us the rest of the story.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:25.670 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So how he was nominated,
it's because his county all

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:35.040 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden rated on top of
11 time zones in Russia in all

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.984 align:middle line:90%
the--

00:20:36.984 --> 00:20:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>> As best place to live.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It was the best place
to live all of the sudden.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:42.930 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And what happened next is
that amazing island of sanity.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:84%
First of all,
democracy was created,

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.950 align:middle line:84%
because it was a council
running the whole community.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And they had the first in
Russia cable television

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:08.280 align:middle line:84%
where all the council media
was videotaped and transmitted

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.020 align:middle line:90%
into every apartment.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And also, they had the
first time in Russia

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.610 align:middle line:84%
when every citizen of the
community had a telephone.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:21.750 align:middle line:84%
At that time, just a
regular landline telephone

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.780 align:middle line:90%
was a privilege only for, like--

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Where families would just
share it if you even got one.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was a privilege for
members of Communist Party.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.240 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the people had
to stay in line for it.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.830 align:middle line:84%
My parents stood in line for
that landline for 23 years.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.025 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:21:38.025 --> 00:21:39.210 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.730 align:middle line:84%
We had some Russian
friends for many years,

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:45.016 align:middle line:84%
and they explained with their
life was like, and yeah.

00:21:45.016 --> 00:21:47.765 align:middle line:84%
>> I wouldn't even
know where to begin.

00:21:47.765 --> 00:21:49.390 align:middle line:84%
But that's the thing,
in the community,

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.420 align:middle line:90%
everyone had the telephone.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And they would telephone
their opinion or their votes

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.070 align:middle line:84%
immediately to where
the council was.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
watching, you know?

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:05.370 align:middle line:84%
It was very active,
working democracy,

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:06.930 align:middle line:84%
because they were
all interested.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:84%
It was all about their
life, about decisions

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:15.515 align:middle line:84%
about the quality of
their being, you know?

00:22:15.515 --> 00:22:16.875 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:22:16.875 --> 00:22:19.690 align:middle line:90%


00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I would love you to
look at my documentary,

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.560 align:middle line:90%
"How Dreams Come True."

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And also, there is another
article on my site--

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:33.570 align:middle line:84%
it's called "Russian Games--"
that describes that school.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
games that I described

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.700 align:middle line:84%
is that one, the School
of the 21st Century.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.300 align:middle line:90%
And it describes what happened.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And now other schools since
then based on that principle

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.633 align:middle line:84%
have been developed
around the country?

00:22:47.633 --> 00:22:49.050 align:middle line:84%
We were going to
go to one of them

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:54.480 align:middle line:84%
last summer where essentially,
the children teach one another

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.932 align:middle line:84%
and learn together in saturated
blocks of one subject at a time

00:22:58.932 --> 00:23:00.390 align:middle line:84%
where they explore
it until they've

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.150 align:middle line:84%
explored to their full potential
of imagination, creativity,

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:90%
and logic.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>> It's beautiful.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.810 align:middle line:84%
So you can read the
description in that article

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:12.300 align:middle line:90%
that I wrote in '93.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And it describes that school
that was created back then

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:20.340 align:middle line:84%
in '85 as an unprecedented
concept of education

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.080 align:middle line:90%
for children.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.680 align:middle line:84%
What would you do if you don't
have to comply with anything?

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.110 align:middle line:90%
So it was one of those--

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Standardized tests.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:31.430 align:middle line:90%
No such thing.

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:32.910 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.050 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's the thing.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Sort of in that
community, it was

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:47.190 align:middle line:84%
married as how to work
with babies, with children,

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:52.230 align:middle line:84%
how women came together to do,
you know, their woman's thing.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:57.810 align:middle line:84%
How men came together to learn
from each other how to be men.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Didn't you kind
of play in games?

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And when I say play,
I mean that literally.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:06.780 align:middle line:84%
A new way of being together
and playing together

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:10.050 align:middle line:84%
come out of this among adults,
teenagers, and children?

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Because that's what's lost.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So this is all
described in there.

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:21.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to take
any more of our time.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.650 align:middle line:84%
But this is the thing, that
those communities became

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:34.270 align:middle line:84%
islands of dreams coming true
in the middle of Soviet Russia,

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.070 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:37.290 align:middle line:90%
It was early '80s.

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:38.880 align:middle line:90%
It was mid '80s.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it
was rocking the boat

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:45.330 align:middle line:84%
in such a profound
way between the games

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and the communities
building and all this.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Mothers snapping off
of that mass hypnosis

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.230 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to not go
to state institution

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and homeschool their
children, or just

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.790 align:middle line:90%
come together in the community.

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:03.810 align:middle line:90%
It was an amazing, amazing time.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:09.630 align:middle line:84%
If only Gorbachev would
not be such a lame leader

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:11.370 align:middle line:84%
and supported a
little bit instead

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:15.480 align:middle line:84%
of putting a wet blanket
on all of this moment.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:21.570 align:middle line:84%
You see, for the government
he was a bit too soft,

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:28.200 align:middle line:84%
and for the people he wasn't
intelligent enough to really--

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.880 align:middle line:90%
the window was open.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.270 align:middle line:84%
He could have done so
much good by just simply

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.860 align:middle line:90%
not being in the way.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Just letting people do
what they need to do.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.680 align:middle line:90%
And supporting a little bit.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:47.160 align:middle line:84%
But you know, all this
billions of humanitarian aid

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:52.270 align:middle line:84%
that was pouring from the West,
people never saw a dime of it.

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:55.290 align:middle line:84%
It all landed up
somewhere in the--

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Same small pockets.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Same few.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Same few small pockets.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.500 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:08.120 align:middle line:84%
If only it had just a
little bit of support,

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Russia could be heaven
on Earth already.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.140 align:middle line:90%
It was such a momentum there.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:17.170 align:middle line:90%
But going back to Anastasia--

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Anastasia.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.930 align:middle line:84%
The Western presentation,
Anastasia, just because I

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:23.100 align:middle line:90%
hadn't set that up yet.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:24.900 align:middle line:90%
The series of books.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So many people have
fallen in love with.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:28.560 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.180 align:middle line:90%
Russian name is "Anas-tasea."

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Anastasia.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:31.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.720 align:middle line:90%
Good to know that.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>> And is she real?

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:39.270 align:middle line:90%
But not just her.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:43.890 align:middle line:84%
There is thousands of
Anastasias out there.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And the real story is so
much more powerful and so

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:50.670 align:middle line:84%
much more beautiful than
what's written in the books.

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.730 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't have
that personable--

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:56.190 align:middle line:84%
you know, all those women
in all those communities

00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:01.420 align:middle line:90%
know basically what is.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.030 align:middle line:84%
How to play with
children, how to--

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I have a question about that.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.750 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
was brought up repeatedly

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:13.150 align:middle line:84%
in the books was about the
notion of a group of people

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:16.440 align:middle line:84%
that had retained their
knowledges through time,

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:22.030 align:middle line:84%
who the author Vladimir MegrÃ©
called the Vedruss people.

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Now that part of the lore,
you being from Siberia,

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:27.670 align:middle line:90%
was there any truth in that?

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Were there people who
were said to have still

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:32.650 align:middle line:84%
had their knowledges
intact at that time?

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Not in that sense.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Not in that sense.

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:45.040 align:middle line:84%
The old people are
broken, and no.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.430 align:middle line:84%
I would have known
if there is anybody,

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.367 align:middle line:90%
because I was always on the--

00:27:50.367 --> 00:27:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>> The leading edge.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>> --cutting edge of
whatever it is, you know?

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:54.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So in fact, where did
Vladimir get his inspiration

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:57.820 align:middle line:90%
then?

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.050 align:middle line:90%
Was it from the villages?

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>> He probably met one of those
girls from the community that

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:04.480 align:middle line:90%
blew his mind, you know?

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.210 align:middle line:90%
His business, kind of--

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>> --small mind of just
the Soviet education.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.515 align:middle line:90%
And she probably just shared--

00:28:14.515 --> 00:28:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Shared her vision and
understanding and experience

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.090 align:middle line:84%
of it, which was
still beautiful.

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:20.440 align:middle line:90%
>> It is beautiful.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.250 align:middle line:90%
It is beautiful.

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:23.710 align:middle line:90%
It is beautiful.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>> The point is--

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>> The point is--

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>> It's much larger.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.490 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't one girl.

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And it wasn't
something in the future.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.960 align:middle line:90%
It was already happening.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.360 align:middle line:84%
It was already
marching the country.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:39.550 align:middle line:84%
By the time his books came out,
basically the whole movement

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:42.790 align:middle line:84%
was on decline already
because of the nightmare

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:49.480 align:middle line:84%
of the sociopolitical,
economical kind of situation

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.690 align:middle line:84%
created by the government,
by the mafia, by--

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Greedy interests.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>> But-- yeah.

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And so maybe the
beauty of that series,

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:04.300 align:middle line:84%
to resurrect it and have it
go into English much later is

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.990 align:middle line:84%
to bring this back now, because
these little communities based

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:13.150 align:middle line:84%
on the Anastasia books are
now popping up in America,

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:14.530 align:middle line:90%
in Europe, and all over.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Australia, Africa.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.680 align:middle line:90%
I am seeing them everywhere.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.590 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:27.900 align:middle line:84%
You see, those real accounts,
those dry, very sort

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.210 align:middle line:84%
of precise accounts, there
is three books about them.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:33.550 align:middle line:90%
They never went anywhere.

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>> We needed a better story.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>> You put a chicken
there, and it just goes.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>> You're absolutely right.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.750 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I guess, more power to Vladimir
for putting it out there

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.410 align:middle line:84%
in a way that people
are attracted to.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Because one thing the books
said that really struck me is

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:54.400 align:middle line:84%
that the girl he was talking
to said, please use my words,

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.140 align:middle line:90%
because they're precise.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And when we spoke with
his English publisher,

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Leonid Sharashkin,
who is also Russian,

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and has his child in one of
those schools in Russia right

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:05.730 align:middle line:90%
now--

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:09.850 align:middle line:84%
they moved back-- he
said that he obviously

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:11.960 align:middle line:84%
got his information
from somewhere else,

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.650 align:middle line:84%
because he was simply an
entrepreneur and not really

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:18.230 align:middle line:84%
prone to that kind of quality
of thought on his own.

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Which, that's what I
got, is he did get something

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.190 align:middle line:90%
of a higher nature that spoke--

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:27.372 align:middle line:84%
and those words spoke through
and have touched millions

00:30:27.372 --> 00:30:28.330 align:middle line:90%
and millions of hearts.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So one of these girls
has somehow emerged--

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Somehow she impressed him so
much by just telling him what

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:37.420 align:middle line:90%
is happening.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:42.230 align:middle line:84%
But he made himself a
central figure of the--

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>> --of the whole thing.

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:46.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing, you know?

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes legend has
more power to inspire

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:53.200 align:middle line:90%
than the actual events.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And there was truth
within all of it.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.320 align:middle line:84%
In the actual
information is truth.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.910 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm saying, that
the real story is much more

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:04.210 align:middle line:84%
powerful and much
bigger, but the books

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:10.360 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that are making it
delivered to the mass mentality

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.160 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>> When we're looking for change
en masse all over the world.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So I say, thank
you, Vladimir.

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:20.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, whoever the girl was.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Thank you and your husband
for having been really

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:29.380 align:middle line:84%
at the core of this movement
that resulted in this,

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:33.040 align:middle line:84%
and are all having access
to this incredible vision

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.300 align:middle line:84%
that we can create
for ourselves now.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.390 align:middle line:90%
It's just beautiful.

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:40.810 align:middle line:84%
It brought tears to my eyes
when I was reading the words

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:44.290 align:middle line:84%
about the way of dealing
with nature and birth and all

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:45.580 align:middle line:90%
of the concepts within.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And here I'm sitting
before a woman

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:51.250 align:middle line:84%
that was really central to
the development of that.

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was the
going between, you know.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.580 align:middle line:84%
I was just knowing
the right people,

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:59.850 align:middle line:84%
because I met Igor Charkovsky
in Moscow who was coming up

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:01.530 align:middle line:90%
with all these ideas.

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:05.070 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was the
last thing on my mind,

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:07.080 align:middle line:84%
working with babies
and children.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.520 align:middle line:90%
I was an actress.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:13.620 align:middle line:84%
I was taking over the world
and playing with my husband.

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:20.490 align:middle line:84%
But see, the thing is
that Anastasia inspired--

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:21.460 align:middle line:90%
I lost.

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.060 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I was going to say something.

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Anastasia certainly
has inspired myself.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.970 align:middle line:84%
It's inspired many of our
viewers, my son, his generation

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:34.300 align:middle line:90%
to a great deal.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is, you
know, the full story--

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:42.330 align:middle line:84%
not the full story, but at least
the bigger scope of the story.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Russian games and
How Dreams Come True

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:47.530 align:middle line:84%
on my website and
my documentary,

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.970 align:middle line:84%
"How Dreams Come True,"
that I will give you a copy.

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And we'll encourage
people to watch that.

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, I
just want to wrap up

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:56.330 align:middle line:84%
this portion of
our conversation.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much,
because we had not

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.620 align:middle line:84%
at all planned on going
here, and I'm so glad we did.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:05.130 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:06.600 align:middle line:10%
I believe it's
important to honor

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.540 align:middle line:10%
all of the ways in which this
profound information makes

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.760 align:middle line:10%
its way into our
hearts and minds.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.460 align:middle line:10%
While MegrÃ©'s Anastasia may or
may not have been a beautiful

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:17.340 align:middle line:10%
blonde who lived in a little
flowing dress in the Siberian

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:20.740 align:middle line:10%
tundra, the knowledge of
Anastasia is very real.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.620 align:middle line:10%
It gives us hope
that we can create

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.020 align:middle line:10%
our world in a new
way, one that sustains

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:28.620 align:middle line:10%
our life force, creativity,
joy, and respect for all living

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.580 align:middle line:10%
things.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:32.870 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thanks
for watching CMN.
