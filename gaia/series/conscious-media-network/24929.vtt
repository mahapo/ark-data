00:00:00.352 --> 00:00:03.352
<v ->If you've seen our interview with Dr. Leslie Feinberg,</v>

2
00:00:03.352 --> 00:00:05.012
you already have an understanding

3
00:00:05.012 --> 00:00:07.112
of healing through the quantum field.

4
00:00:07.112 --> 00:00:09.032
In this fascinating interview,

5
00:00:09.032 --> 00:00:10.912
Dr. Thom Rodgers tells us that

6
00:00:10.912 --> 00:00:13.212
Dr. Feinberg's profound healing modality

7
00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:15.392
extends beyond the human being.

8
00:00:15.392 --> 00:00:17.472
That the same technology can be applied

9
00:00:17.472 --> 00:00:19.372
to healing businesses.

10
00:00:19.372 --> 00:00:21.951
This news offers a lifeline to many business owners

11
00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:24.391
and corporate leaders who can not identify

12
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.912
why their businesses are not operating at their potential.

13
00:00:27.912 --> 00:00:30.292
As Thom explains, there are many hidden beliefs

14
00:00:30.292 --> 00:00:33.592
and illusions that hold a business from its prosperity.

15
00:00:34.612 --> 00:00:37.862 line:15% 
(relaxing music)

16
00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:45.166
<v Woman>It's an interesting path</v>

17
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.767
that you've found yourself on

18
00:00:46.767 --> 00:00:48.807
with having a background within your family

19
00:00:48.807 --> 00:00:51.387
and the world of business and economics and so forth,

20
00:00:51.387 --> 00:00:54.606
and then being a seeker of true knowledge and a healer.

21
00:00:54.606 --> 00:00:57.367
25 years of healing, Applied Kinesiology in many,

22
00:00:57.367 --> 00:01:01.827
many modalities to blend these two to heal businesses.

23
00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:05.027
And business isn't just a cold

24
00:01:05.027 --> 00:01:08.207
harsh reality someone has to deal with.

25
00:01:08.207 --> 00:01:11.066
This is an extension of our true desires

26
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.407
to contribute in life.

27
00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:15.507
It's an extension of us as human beings.

28
00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:18.167
So, let's talk about how,

29
00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:20.407
from your point of view,

30
00:01:20.407 --> 00:01:23.386
you view a business.

31
00:01:23.386 --> 00:01:25.327
<v ->I'm viewing a business these days</v>

32
00:01:25.327 --> 00:01:27.507
much differently than I used to.

33
00:01:27.507 --> 00:01:29.827
I used to view a business as

34
00:01:29.827 --> 00:01:31.787
things that I would work in,

35
00:01:31.787 --> 00:01:33.987
I would derive income from,

36
00:01:33.987 --> 00:01:36.107
I would be engaged in,

37
00:01:36.107 --> 00:01:38.407
either parts of its growth or whatever.

38
00:01:38.407 --> 00:01:40.046
Now, I'm looking at businesses

39
00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:41.726
from a whole different viewpoint.

40
00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:43.627
From all my years in healing,

41
00:01:43.627 --> 00:01:45.786
I now know, and we work with,

42
00:01:45.786 --> 00:01:47.926
the entity of a business.

43
00:01:47.926 --> 00:01:49.406
The entity.

44
00:01:49.406 --> 00:01:51.687
The entity is made up of the people who own

45
00:01:51.687 --> 00:01:53.946
the business, that work in the business,

46
00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:56.807
the people who are employed throughout the

47
00:01:56.807 --> 00:02:01.807
different subcontractees, the board,

48
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.140
the public who purchases products if they happen

49
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.960
to be for that purpose.

50
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.440
All the people that engaged in business

51
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.180
they come together and they form this entity.

52
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.759
And the entity is actually a living, breathing organism.

53
00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:19.239
And it can actually be palpated in the sense of being

54
00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.820
able to get a sense of what it's doing,

55
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.380
what it wants, what it needs,

56
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.600
what it's not aware of, and where it's trying to grow to.

57
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.660
And we have found by working a little bit

58
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.100
more deeply than just on a physical level,

59
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.460
but working directly with the entity itself,

60
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.739
things happen and things change in the businesses.

61
00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.560
<v Woman>Is it fair to say that this business then</v>

62
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.760
is a collection of all of the intentions,

63
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.460
all of the fears, all of the energies

64
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.340
of all of these people,

65
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.240
have created this living, breathing entity

66
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.759
that has a name.
<v ->That's right.</v>

67
00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Woman>It has a birth date usually,</v>

68
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.720
it has a purpose in life,

69
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.220
and so when you go into the business

70
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.740
and look at it on this level,

71
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.659
let's talk about how it would begin

72
00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.700
for you to enter a business.

73
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.740
In fact, if you want, let's talk about

74
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.261
what a business you've already worked with

75
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:07.259
might look like for example.

76
00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:09.079
And then later we're going to talk about

77
00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.239
the intricacies of the actual science

78
00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.140
and esoteric science behind it.

79
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.020
<v ->So you're asking for maybe some--</v>

80
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.479
<v Woman>Give me an example of what</v>

81
00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:18.980
you approach a business.

82
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.700
Help, my business if floundering,

83
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.480
and we don't know what to do to make a shift

84
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.320
in this business and now if you have an example

85
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.760
that you'd like to offer up at this point, that'd be great.

86
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.079
<v ->Well not all businesses that we</v>

87
00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.959
contract with are floundering.

88
00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.300
In fact, some of them are succeeding already

89
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.539
and they're just seeking to do better

90
00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.640
than their expected awareness of what

91
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.060
they think they can do.

92
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.600
But, I will give you an example of the business

93
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.060
that started us into this work.

94
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.239
And I can't mention the name of the business

95
00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.000
because of confidential reasons with the mother company,

96
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.096
but it was a retail concern.

97
00:03:52.096 --> 00:03:54.956
There was some 400 of these concerns within the country.

98
00:03:54.956 --> 00:03:59.496
It was in the field of natural beauty and natural substances

99
00:03:59.496 --> 00:04:02.496
that people would enjoy in their life.

100
00:04:02.496 --> 00:04:04.636
And that's all I can say about that,

101
00:04:04.636 --> 00:04:06.656
but they were not doing well.

102
00:04:06.656 --> 00:04:08.956
In fact, they were doing poorly in terms of

103
00:04:08.956 --> 00:04:11.535
their region and the last 3 or 4 years of history.

104
00:04:11.535 --> 00:04:16.535
And they contacted us and my partner, Dr. Goddell,

105
00:04:16.616 --> 00:04:20.776
began the process and we engaged two

106
00:04:20.776 --> 00:04:22.916
different attunements with them.

107
00:04:22.916 --> 00:04:26.176
These are sessions that we spend with the business.

108
00:04:26.176 --> 00:04:28.216
And this is what happened.

109
00:04:28.216 --> 00:04:30.156
We started with them at the end of November,

110
00:04:30.156 --> 00:04:32.397
this is a couple years ago now,

111
00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:35.616
it was I think toward the last week in November,

112
00:04:35.616 --> 00:04:38.356
and we did the attunement.

113
00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:41.756
And in December, their sales shot up

114
00:04:41.756 --> 00:04:46.376
I think it was like 15%.

115
00:04:48.046 --> 00:04:52.436
And in January, it increased to 22%

116
00:04:52.436 --> 00:04:55.776
and then in February it increased--

117
00:04:55.776 --> 00:04:57.296
<v Woman>Which is interesting, because that's</v>

118
00:04:57.296 --> 00:04:59.296
usually a real dead zone for retail.

119
00:04:59.296 --> 00:05:00.875
If it is a retailer service industry,

120
00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:02.456
January isn't the hot month.

121
00:05:02.456 --> 00:05:04.496
<v ->In retail, that's usually always the case.</v>

122
00:05:04.496 --> 00:05:05.236
<v Woman>Yeah.</v>

123
00:05:05.236 --> 00:05:07.016
<v ->In this case, it was not.</v>

124
00:05:07.016 --> 00:05:08.716
And these people then went on and in February

125
00:05:08.716 --> 00:05:11.157
to actually grow as well, from their proceeding year.

126
00:05:11.157 --> 00:05:13.556
But what was interesting was that during January,

127
00:05:13.556 --> 00:05:15.476
they had the number one loyalty product

128
00:05:15.476 --> 00:05:18.476
of their company throughout the nation.

129
00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:20.476
<v Woman>Oh, that's amazing.</v>

130
00:05:20.476 --> 00:05:22.356
<v ->And during February, they went on to make</v>

131
00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:25.176
number one in their national sales

132
00:05:25.176 --> 00:05:26.716
with all the different retail,

133
00:05:26.716 --> 00:05:29.716
and they were kind of at the bottom of the barrel.

134
00:05:29.716 --> 00:05:31.796
And with this, we had only done two attunement

135
00:05:31.796 --> 00:05:34.116
sessions with them, and that really caught

136
00:05:34.116 --> 00:05:35.896
our attention (laughs).

137
00:05:35.896 --> 00:05:38.236
And that's slightly after we incorporated

138
00:05:38.236 --> 00:05:40.796
to form this business, but we were very much

139
00:05:40.796 --> 00:05:44.136
aware of the potentials that we had with the business

140
00:05:44.136 --> 00:05:46.296
and working with them after that experience.

141
00:05:46.296 --> 00:05:48.576
<v Woman>What gave both of you the notion</v>

142
00:05:48.576 --> 00:05:51.276
that you could apply these skills

143
00:05:51.276 --> 00:05:54.296
of also Dr. Feinberg's work?

144
00:05:54.296 --> 00:05:57.596
I mean this was really largely influential in this.

145
00:05:57.596 --> 00:05:59.716
That you could apply these skills to a business,

146
00:05:59.716 --> 00:06:01.316
what was the conversation that took place

147
00:06:01.316 --> 00:06:03.256
if it was a conversation?

148
00:06:03.256 --> 00:06:06.609
<v ->Well, I remember actually the moment that set</v>

149
00:06:06.609 --> 00:06:09.580
the seed alight in me and we had already been involved

150
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.000
in learning with Dr. Feinberg and applying it into

151
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.419
the healing field with our patients.

152
00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.439
And I can tell you categorically that

153
00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:19.199
with all the processes that I've learned and studied,

154
00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:22.380
this process was way, way different

155
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.119
and more effective than anything I had used before.

156
00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:28.239
I watched pathophysiologies, and still do to this day,

157
00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:31.559
change fairly quickly, quicker than I had seen

158
00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:34.499
things happen before in the form of change.

159
00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:39.180
And it really, I knew there was truth in this system

160
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.520
because I was just seeing too much

161
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.560
in front of my own eyes and people's experience.

162
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.420
So, Dr. Feinberg was in a class once

163
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.400
and both Dr. Matt and myself were in the class,

164
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.299
and he's going on and on.

165
00:06:53.299 --> 00:06:55.260
I think we were maybe discussing the morphic fields

166
00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.040
at the time, Rupert Sheldrake's work.

167
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.459
<v Woman>Rupert Sheldrake, yes.</v>

168
00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:00.399
<v ->Which is an aspect of our work.</v>

169
00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:02.200
And then all of the sudden he just goes,

170
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.379
he pauses and this moment happens

171
00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:08.280
and for 30 seconds, he said,

172
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.200
"You know, you could apply this to a business

173
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.139
and the businesses would do very, very well.

174
00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:13.500
I'm certain of it."

175
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.479
And he went on to give a little bit more

176
00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:17.979
understanding of how that could be and then

177
00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.139
30 seconds went by and he goes back into his

178
00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:22.228
discourse on whatever it was.

179
00:07:22.228 --> 00:07:23.868
<v Woman>A little gift for you.</v>

180
00:07:23.868 --> 00:07:25.128
<v ->I heard that.
<v Woman>Yes.</v>

181
00:07:25.128 --> 00:07:26.628
<v ->And Dr. Matt heard that.</v>

182
00:07:26.628 --> 00:07:29.488
And it wasn't long after where the whole thing unfolded

183
00:07:29.488 --> 00:07:32.948
and Matt started working with other businesses

184
00:07:32.948 --> 00:07:35.108
to see if that is in fact true.

185
00:07:35.108 --> 00:07:37.708
He had family businesses and others that were willing

186
00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:40.608
to allow us to experiment and see what would happen

187
00:07:40.608 --> 00:07:42.528
if we applied these techniques.

188
00:07:42.528 --> 00:07:45.289
And so we've been basically carving out of the system

189
00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:48.388
that Dr. Feinberg taught us, a whole evolution

190
00:07:48.388 --> 00:07:52.288
of a way to apply it to a company.

191
00:07:52.288 --> 00:07:54.988
<v Woman>When you begin the attunement process</v>

192
00:07:54.988 --> 00:07:58.619
with a company, they've contacted you for whatever

193
00:07:58.619 --> 00:08:01.608
reason of their own,

194
00:08:01.608 --> 00:08:03.168
what is entailed in this?

195
00:08:03.168 --> 00:08:05.048
And maybe we should get into some of the science,

196
00:08:05.048 --> 00:08:07.068
we are talking about morphogenic fields.

197
00:08:07.068 --> 00:08:08.028
<v ->In part.</v>

198
00:08:08.028 --> 00:08:09.488
<v Woman>Very important.</v>

199
00:08:09.488 --> 00:08:11.908
And we're talking about effecting change

200
00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:14.148
and collaboration within morphogenic fields

201
00:08:14.148 --> 00:08:16.568
and the movement of information, right?

202
00:08:16.568 --> 00:08:18.808
And agreement, it seems that information and agreement

203
00:08:18.808 --> 00:08:21.488
in such is really key to this.

204
00:08:21.488 --> 00:08:22.988
Can you talk about what that is?

205
00:08:22.988 --> 00:08:25.049
If you can reduce it to a bit of a nutshell

206
00:08:25.049 --> 00:08:27.089
for those who haven't seen Dr. Feinberg's

207
00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:28.569
interview with us.

208
00:08:28.569 --> 00:08:30.648
<v ->Well there's several factors.</v>

209
00:08:30.648 --> 00:08:32.688
One, there's awareness.

210
00:08:32.688 --> 00:08:34.248
There's always some part of yourself

211
00:08:34.248 --> 00:08:36.469
or some part of a company that's aware of something.

212
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:39.568
But usually, all parts are not.

213
00:08:39.568 --> 00:08:42.369
And so often the case, when that becomes,

214
00:08:42.369 --> 00:08:44.429
when all parts become aware,

215
00:08:44.429 --> 00:08:46.288
something greater starts to happen

216
00:08:46.288 --> 00:08:49.049
and change within the company.

217
00:08:49.049 --> 00:08:50.669
There's also pathways that we have

218
00:08:50.669 --> 00:08:53.708
that shine mirrors up to the entity of a company

219
00:08:53.708 --> 00:08:56.609
for it to self reflect upon itself.

220
00:08:56.609 --> 00:08:58.588
And again, through our binary testing

221
00:08:58.588 --> 00:09:00.488
and different methods that we use,

222
00:09:00.488 --> 00:09:04.449
it can show the entity what it is that needs to be seen.

223
00:09:04.449 --> 00:09:06.968
There's other factors.

224
00:09:06.968 --> 00:09:08.928
And this is even deeper into the essence

225
00:09:08.928 --> 00:09:11.289
of perhaps your questions being directed,

226
00:09:11.289 --> 00:09:13.708
and that is what we call human processing errors

227
00:09:13.708 --> 00:09:16.028
or informational faults.
<v Woman>Mhmm.</v>

228
00:09:16.028 --> 00:09:17.808
<v ->These are metaphors</v>

229
00:09:17.808 --> 00:09:20.168
for basically different illusionary constructs

230
00:09:20.168 --> 00:09:23.288
that are contrary to attunement with the source of creation

231
00:09:23.288 --> 00:09:25.908
and the inborn intelligence that lie within all of us.

232
00:09:25.908 --> 00:09:28.049
And also, even to the consciousness of prosperity

233
00:09:28.049 --> 00:09:31.148
and abundance, which lies within all of us.

234
00:09:31.148 --> 00:09:33.649
And these constructs are metaphors.

235
00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:35.808
And there's many different sorts of them

236
00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:38.868
and we study and utilize them in our work.

237
00:09:38.868 --> 00:09:43.528
By being able to assess what is off in a company,

238
00:09:43.528 --> 00:09:47.248
why isn't it 100% attune to its omission,

239
00:09:47.248 --> 00:09:51.429
why isn't it 100% attune to its short or long term goals?

240
00:09:51.429 --> 00:09:55.448
Why isn't it congruent with these things?

241
00:09:55.448 --> 00:09:59.728
Why isn't it 100% attuned to the resolution of its concerns?

242
00:09:59.728 --> 00:10:01.028
<v Woman>Mhmm.</v>

243
00:10:01.028 --> 00:10:02.349
<v ->Why?</v>

244
00:10:02.349 --> 00:10:04.448
And the underlying reason is that

245
00:10:04.448 --> 00:10:07.729
there's aspects within the entity itself that are not

246
00:10:07.729 --> 00:10:11.029
attune or aligned with the source from which all life comes.

247
00:10:11.029 --> 00:10:13.409
<v Woman>Often, an illusion of some kind is going on.</v>

248
00:10:13.409 --> 00:10:16.229
<v ->Sometimes. And it's not just a illusion.</v>

249
00:10:16.229 --> 00:10:18.448
I'd like to say it could be millions, billions,

250
00:10:18.448 --> 00:10:21.208
trillions, quadrillions, quintillions, and so on.

251
00:10:21.208 --> 00:10:23.368
<v Woman>And it can be individual and collective illusions.</v>

252
00:10:23.368 --> 00:10:24.927
<v ->Yes. Absolutely.</v>

253
00:10:24.927 --> 00:10:27.149
That's totally correct.

254
00:10:27.149 --> 00:10:30.849
<v Woman>So, when you do an attunement then,</v>

255
00:10:30.849 --> 00:10:34.428
because it is a very, I know the word elegant is overused

256
00:10:34.428 --> 00:10:36.988
these days when it comes to anything to do with physics,

257
00:10:36.988 --> 00:10:40.129
but it is a very elegant and a very direct system

258
00:10:40.129 --> 00:10:41.448
that you're working with.

259
00:10:41.448 --> 00:10:43.469
As you said, this company you referred to a moment ago,

260
00:10:43.469 --> 00:10:45.389
you only did 2 attunements.

261
00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:49.388
What are you doing during this attunement?

262
00:10:49.388 --> 00:10:50.528
What are you looking at?

263
00:10:50.528 --> 00:10:55.528
What are you attuning the consciousness to, for example?

264
00:10:55.549 --> 00:10:58.609
<v ->Well that's a really good question.</v>

265
00:10:58.609 --> 00:11:01.968
I'll see if I can take that and give you

266
00:11:01.968 --> 00:11:03.788
a good response on that.

267
00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:06.248
<v Woman>Yeah, even bite-size chunks, it's okay.</v>

268
00:11:06.248 --> 00:11:08.029
<v ->Well, we meet with the people</v>

269
00:11:08.029 --> 00:11:10.149
and gather their information

270
00:11:10.149 --> 00:11:11.429
and we have a short little questionnaire

271
00:11:11.429 --> 00:11:13.408
that they fill out, but it takes a while

272
00:11:13.408 --> 00:11:15.828
and for a lot of business owners it really

273
00:11:15.828 --> 00:11:17.968
makes them think about what they're doing

274
00:11:17.968 --> 00:11:19.529
and what they are doing.

275
00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:22.068
Many don't even have a mission statement.

276
00:11:22.068 --> 00:11:25.188
And once we get past that stage,

277
00:11:25.188 --> 00:11:27.528
then we actually meet with them on a conference line.

278
00:11:27.528 --> 00:11:29.609
We do most of this work remotely.

279
00:11:29.609 --> 00:11:32.228
We can do that through the field of intentions,

280
00:11:32.228 --> 00:11:35.968
we can do that through all the different ways

281
00:11:35.968 --> 00:11:38.709
that you can connect with beings

282
00:11:38.709 --> 00:11:41.668
without them being physically present.

283
00:11:41.668 --> 00:11:44.688
So as we go into this process,

284
00:11:44.688 --> 00:11:48.008
we are querying through the different

285
00:11:48.008 --> 00:11:51.329
states of where the company is deficient.

286
00:11:51.329 --> 00:11:53.449
<v Woman>So might you be, sort of testing</v>

287
00:11:53.449 --> 00:11:55.788
along the way with the various techniques you use

288
00:11:55.788 --> 00:11:58.329
as they're presenting information to you?

289
00:11:58.329 --> 00:12:01.388
You and Matt are on the other side of the line,

290
00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:04.008
doing the testing and calibrating as it were?

291
00:12:04.008 --> 00:12:05.728
<v ->We do a lot of calibrating</v>

292
00:12:05.728 --> 00:12:07.948
and we're using a lot of different types of morphic field

293
00:12:07.948 --> 00:12:11.208
informations to calibrate with.

294
00:12:11.208 --> 00:12:14.308
The idea is that we want every aspect of the company

295
00:12:14.308 --> 00:12:17.688
to be 100% attuned to what we're calibrating.

296
00:12:17.688 --> 00:12:20.868
In the attunement process, there's surveying

297
00:12:20.868 --> 00:12:23.608
and scanning processes that take place

298
00:12:23.608 --> 00:12:26.589
so we can go deeply into the informational structures

299
00:12:26.589 --> 00:12:30.609
of the business and gather forth information.

300
00:12:30.609 --> 00:12:32.768
And then we also have what we call

301
00:12:32.768 --> 00:12:36.729
universal correction moments, where the things

302
00:12:36.729 --> 00:12:39.128
that are being gathered by the scanning

303
00:12:39.128 --> 00:12:41.449
are being able to be re-attuned or released to the

304
00:12:41.449 --> 00:12:44.169
source of creation so that a shift can take place

305
00:12:44.169 --> 00:12:46.568
within the consciousness and within the

306
00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:48.608
energy fields of the business.

307
00:12:48.608 --> 00:12:51.388
We're dealing with fields in the business.

308
00:12:51.388 --> 00:12:53.428
And these fields are very important.

309
00:12:53.428 --> 00:12:56.128
I like the analogy of a football in the middle

310
00:12:56.128 --> 00:12:58.509
of a football field and a baseball on the

311
00:12:58.509 --> 00:13:00.689
outside of the whole stadium, surrounding it.

312
00:13:00.689 --> 00:13:04.028
And that's basically the neutron and the electron

313
00:13:04.028 --> 00:13:06.109
and all the space in between is space

314
00:13:06.109 --> 00:13:08.008
and that's what every atom consists of,

315
00:13:08.008 --> 00:13:09.588
as most people are familiar with.

316
00:13:09.588 --> 00:13:10.409
<v Woman>Mhmm.</v>

317
00:13:10.409 --> 00:13:12.008
<v ->So how can all this space</v>

318
00:13:12.008 --> 00:13:13.268
create all these different things

319
00:13:13.268 --> 00:13:14.508
that we see physically?

320
00:13:14.508 --> 00:13:16.089
Or that we experience?

321
00:13:16.089 --> 00:13:17.288
And these are the fields

322
00:13:17.288 --> 00:13:19.168
and these fields are invisible fields

323
00:13:19.168 --> 00:13:21.809
but they're fields that you can work with.

324
00:13:21.809 --> 00:13:23.569
And that's basically where we're putting our attention

325
00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:25.668
in the attunement process.

326
00:13:25.668 --> 00:13:29.488
<v Woman>So if you have, say, a somehow corrupted</v>

327
00:13:29.488 --> 00:13:33.328
collective vision as a company,

328
00:13:33.328 --> 00:13:37.688
tell me if I'm correct in what I'm hearing.

329
00:13:37.688 --> 00:13:41.368
That there are natural laws

330
00:13:41.368 --> 00:13:44.108
that we all would be in a flow with,

331
00:13:44.108 --> 00:13:46.888
were it not for our various beliefs and illusions,

332
00:13:46.888 --> 00:13:50.069
which are abundance and prosperity,

333
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:54.058
which are integrity and collective healing and so forth.

334
00:13:54.058 --> 00:13:57.621
So, if there is an illusion that falls off of those

335
00:13:57.621 --> 00:14:01.621
natural laws, are you attuning that company then

336
00:14:01.621 --> 00:14:05.272
back to a larger given so to speak,

337
00:14:05.272 --> 00:14:08.361
rather than a mission statement?

338
00:14:08.361 --> 00:14:10.801
Or are you attuning them back to their own

339
00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:13.101
desire or mission statement?

340
00:14:13.101 --> 00:14:15.941
<v ->Well, everything.</v>

341
00:14:15.941 --> 00:14:19.171
Everything is included in our work

342
00:14:19.171 --> 00:14:24.171
and everything is with the intention of making sure

343
00:14:24.221 --> 00:14:29.221
their goals are going to be as fully possible to realize

344
00:14:29.698 --> 00:14:33.598
as it is possible to do.

345
00:14:33.598 --> 00:14:35.897
And perhaps in shorter time frames.

346
00:14:35.897 --> 00:14:37.658
And for its mission to be deepened.

347
00:14:37.658 --> 00:14:38.608
<v Woman>Mhmm.</v>

348
00:14:38.608 --> 00:14:40.957
<v ->And that's what gives the consciousness to a company,</v>

349
00:14:40.957 --> 00:14:42.678
is its mission.

350
00:14:42.678 --> 00:14:45.438
And for it to have resolution to some of the things

351
00:14:45.438 --> 00:14:47.998
that are impeding it.

352
00:14:47.998 --> 00:14:50.017
To accomplish that, of course we go through

353
00:14:50.017 --> 00:14:54.117
the history of the company, it could be emotional traumas

354
00:14:54.117 --> 00:14:55.657
that the company went through.

355
00:14:55.657 --> 00:14:56.797
<v Woman>Mhmm.</v>

356
00:14:56.797 --> 00:14:59.837
<v ->It could be energetic influences that are compromising</v>

357
00:14:59.837 --> 00:15:04.117
the whole essence of the way a company is put together.

358
00:15:04.117 --> 00:15:07.818
There are a lot of factors

359
00:15:07.818 --> 00:15:10.918
and I can be more specific.

360
00:15:11.218 --> 00:15:14.257
<v Woman>It sounds like it takes a fair amount of courage</v>

361
00:15:14.257 --> 00:15:17.387
for someone to invite you into this process

362
00:15:17.387 --> 00:15:20.637
because it means that very deep foundational

363
00:15:20.637 --> 00:15:22.498
changes may end up taking place

364
00:15:22.498 --> 00:15:24.037
that are unexpected.

365
00:15:24.037 --> 00:15:26.598
<v ->Yeah. Here's some of the things that do happen</v>

366
00:15:26.598 --> 00:15:28.257
in our process.

367
00:15:28.257 --> 00:15:30.857
First of all, there's a lot of stagnancy of energy,

368
00:15:30.857 --> 00:15:33.777
in all of us and in all of the companies that exist.

369
00:15:33.777 --> 00:15:36.017
<v Woman>Which leads to disease of all kinds.</v>

370
00:15:36.017 --> 00:15:38.818
<v ->And it's also part of why companies are under-utilizing</v>

371
00:15:38.818 --> 00:15:41.038
the resources that they already have.

372
00:15:41.038 --> 00:15:44.717
So, we addressed that stagnancy by actually querying forth

373
00:15:44.717 --> 00:15:48.338
some of the factors that are compromising the energy

374
00:15:48.338 --> 00:15:50.177
from being able to be used

375
00:15:50.177 --> 00:15:51.838
to a much more full extent

376
00:15:51.838 --> 00:15:54.617
for the company to achieve its mission and goals.

377
00:15:54.617 --> 00:15:58.477
In the accessing of this, this energy will come up,

378
00:15:58.477 --> 00:16:01.558
and there's things that start to become unfamiliar

379
00:16:01.558 --> 00:16:04.297
for a company and its owner, who are used to controlling

380
00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:07.018
and having things in a certain way.

381
00:16:07.018 --> 00:16:09.098
And it's a test and when they come up,

382
00:16:09.098 --> 00:16:11.577
the owner and the company people that work with this

383
00:16:11.577 --> 00:16:14.698
are fully embraced and if it's something that they

384
00:16:14.698 --> 00:16:17.937
have a little fear about, we basically hold their hand

385
00:16:17.937 --> 00:16:20.918
to allow them to know that this is okay.

386
00:16:20.918 --> 00:16:23.617
They may feel a little fearful, but then on the other side

387
00:16:23.617 --> 00:16:26.518
of that comes a whole new rearrangement.

388
00:16:26.518 --> 00:16:29.137
And why is it that if you're a company and you've made

389
00:16:29.137 --> 00:16:30.897
2 million dollars a year, you haven't been

390
00:16:30.897 --> 00:16:32.677
able to get to the 5?

391
00:16:32.677 --> 00:16:34.418
Or if you've been making 50 million, why can't you

392
00:16:34.418 --> 00:16:36.337
get to a 75 or 100 million dollar?

393
00:16:36.337 --> 00:16:38.157
What is stopping and blocking you

394
00:16:38.157 --> 00:16:40.257
from these accomplishments?

395
00:16:40.257 --> 00:16:41.937
These are the factors.

396
00:16:41.937 --> 00:16:43.737
I mean, things have to change.

397
00:16:43.737 --> 00:16:47.897
I just attended a wonderful talk by John Mackey in Austin,

398
00:16:47.897 --> 00:16:51.117
who both I know and have a great deal of respect for.

399
00:16:51.117 --> 00:16:52.377
<v Woman>Whole Foods.</v>

400
00:16:52.377 --> 00:16:54.657
<v ->Whole Foods, he's the CEO of Whole Foods.</v>

401
00:16:54.657 --> 00:16:56.757
And his talk was on conscious capitalism.

402
00:16:56.757 --> 00:16:59.078
He brought forth a lot of information

403
00:16:59.078 --> 00:17:03.077
as to why a lot of these companies that are in existance

404
00:17:03.077 --> 00:17:05.098
are not doing as well as they could be.

405
00:17:05.098 --> 00:17:07.418
And part of it is because they're not embracing

406
00:17:07.418 --> 00:17:11.157
the full essence of what their mission is.

407
00:17:11.157 --> 00:17:14.677
And that is what brings the consciousness alive

408
00:17:14.677 --> 00:17:17.217
into a company if it's actually furthering humanity

409
00:17:17.217 --> 00:17:19.358
on some level.
<v Woman>Right.</v>

410
00:17:19.358 --> 00:17:21.197
<v ->Within the company and its mission.</v>

411
00:17:21.197 --> 00:17:23.017
<v Woman>And you really try to confine</v>

412
00:17:23.017 --> 00:17:24.977
your business to those companies who are really,

413
00:17:24.977 --> 00:17:27.137
truly making a difference on the planet.

414
00:17:27.137 --> 00:17:29.377
<v ->Yeah, our targets are for the people who are</v>

415
00:17:29.377 --> 00:17:31.697
wanting to do something greater in life,

416
00:17:31.697 --> 00:17:35.258
wanting to make changes and benefits to mankind

417
00:17:35.258 --> 00:17:37.798
or to their area.

418
00:17:37.798 --> 00:17:40.417
In some way, some shape, form, have a humanitarian interest

419
00:17:40.417 --> 00:17:43.638
that's driving them in addition to the profits

420
00:17:43.638 --> 00:17:46.337
that they need to survive and grow.

421
00:17:46.337 --> 00:17:48.077
<v Woman>And how often do you find,</v>

422
00:17:48.077 --> 00:17:49.457
like you said a lot of companies don't have

423
00:17:49.457 --> 00:17:50.997
a mission statement at all,

424
00:17:50.997 --> 00:17:52.537
how often do you find that if they do have

425
00:17:52.537 --> 00:17:54.858
a mission statement, it's not really being true

426
00:17:54.858 --> 00:17:59.218
to the individual's actual deep desires and essence?

427
00:17:59.218 --> 00:18:02.178
<v ->Very true. A lot of it has to do with the consciousness</v>

428
00:18:02.178 --> 00:18:04.978
and the way that the mission was put together.

429
00:18:04.978 --> 00:18:06.617
A lot of people that we work with

430
00:18:06.617 --> 00:18:08.878
start to update and make changes to

431
00:18:08.878 --> 00:18:11.637
what it is that's true for them, especially now.

432
00:18:11.637 --> 00:18:13.617
Sometimes if they even have a mission,

433
00:18:13.617 --> 00:18:16.177
it was put together quite some time ago,

434
00:18:16.177 --> 00:18:18.297
reflecting maybe perhaps a different part

435
00:18:18.297 --> 00:18:20.957
or time of themselves when they made that mission.

436
00:18:20.957 --> 00:18:22.197
<v Woman>And it seems like a lot of those</v>

437
00:18:22.197 --> 00:18:24.498
mission statements would be very academic

438
00:18:24.498 --> 00:18:27.538
or logical or on the mental plane primarily

439
00:18:27.538 --> 00:18:30.537
in nature, where I want to do this even if it's all

440
00:18:30.537 --> 00:18:33.297
dolled up, like I'm going to do this thing for humanity

441
00:18:33.297 --> 00:18:36.797
but in reality you really want to turn a quick buck.

442
00:18:36.797 --> 00:18:39.057
There's an incongruity there energetically

443
00:18:39.057 --> 00:18:41.017
and I would assume that when you go in,

444
00:18:41.017 --> 00:18:43.478
those things are brought to the surface pretty quickly.

445
00:18:43.478 --> 00:18:45.458
<v ->Well, there are companies that just basic, put a little</v>

446
00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:48.758
wallpaper on their company to make it look like

447
00:18:48.758 --> 00:18:52.197
they're an ecology based concern or that they have

448
00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:54.917
this interest, but they're just doing this

449
00:18:54.917 --> 00:18:56.757
to promote their image.

450
00:18:56.757 --> 00:18:58.338
Just like any other advertisement would do

451
00:18:58.338 --> 00:19:00.057
to promote their image.

452
00:19:00.057 --> 00:19:02.358
And those people aren't really serious

453
00:19:02.358 --> 00:19:04.317
in terms of fulfilling a mission.

454
00:19:04.317 --> 00:19:07.097
But there are others that are, or would like to be.

455
00:19:07.097 --> 00:19:09.437
These are the people that are becoming more conscious,

456
00:19:09.437 --> 00:19:11.877
this is a conscious form of capitalism.

457
00:19:11.877 --> 00:19:14.377
And according to John's talk, he says this is the very thing

458
00:19:14.377 --> 00:19:17.877
that we need to give hope and further the direction

459
00:19:17.877 --> 00:19:20.938
and the full force of life because these corporations

460
00:19:20.938 --> 00:19:23.318
have great effects on life.

461
00:19:23.318 --> 00:19:24.797
<v Woman>And how long does it take you to</v>

462
00:19:24.797 --> 00:19:26.677
ascertain whether or not this is wallpaper

463
00:19:26.677 --> 00:19:28.877
or this is at the core?

464
00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:31.378
<v ->Well, it seems like the process of life has been</v>

465
00:19:31.378 --> 00:19:33.337
filtering out the people who come to us,

466
00:19:33.337 --> 00:19:34.897
that become our customers.

467
00:19:34.897 --> 00:19:36.078
We've been very blessed with that.

468
00:19:36.078 --> 00:19:38.218
These are people who are very open.

469
00:19:38.218 --> 00:19:40.058
They're open to making some change,

470
00:19:40.058 --> 00:19:41.237
but they're open to new ideas

471
00:19:41.237 --> 00:19:43.317
or open to finding better ways to do things.

472
00:19:43.317 --> 00:19:45.777
In that openness, everything pretty much

473
00:19:45.777 --> 00:19:47.777
takes care of itself.

474
00:19:47.777 --> 00:19:50.758
And there's generally some authentic part of themselves.

475
00:19:50.758 --> 00:19:54.957
We do not have any customers that do not have that

476
00:19:54.957 --> 00:19:59.577
drive behind what they're wanting to accomplish.

477
00:19:59.577 --> 00:20:01.558
<v Woman>So it's really if you were to look at it</v>

478
00:20:01.558 --> 00:20:05.797
as an individual entity or being, you're talking about

479
00:20:05.797 --> 00:20:08.837
bumping up the immune system of the company

480
00:20:08.837 --> 00:20:12.138
so that each part is working in total cooperation

481
00:20:12.138 --> 00:20:13.698
with the other.

482
00:20:13.698 --> 00:20:15.697
<v ->Much more so, you're getting a much greater flow</v>

483
00:20:15.697 --> 00:20:18.957
in the efficiency, communication, things work out better.

484
00:20:18.957 --> 00:20:21.237
Just more harmonization, more synchronization

485
00:20:21.237 --> 00:20:24.017
within the company and its people.

486
00:20:24.017 --> 00:20:26.157
And the perturbations, which are the conflicts,

487
00:20:26.157 --> 00:20:28.757
are minimized through what we do

488
00:20:28.757 --> 00:20:32.158
because it influences these particular aspects.

489
00:20:32.158 --> 00:20:34.197
It's amazing some of the changes that you

490
00:20:34.197 --> 00:20:36.637
can actually see take place.

491
00:20:36.637 --> 00:20:37.818
<v Woman>Would you mind giving us</v>

492
00:20:37.818 --> 00:20:39.577
another example or two of some of the

493
00:20:39.577 --> 00:20:41.797
astounding turnabouts and sometime

494
00:20:41.797 --> 00:20:44.657
where it may have pushed people up to their

495
00:20:44.657 --> 00:20:46.397
own limits in terms of their own courage

496
00:20:46.397 --> 00:20:48.617
because maybe some significant changes had to

497
00:20:48.617 --> 00:20:50.497
take place but they pulled through?

498
00:20:50.497 --> 00:20:52.478
I love hearing this.

499
00:20:52.478 --> 00:20:54.738
<v ->Yeah, we have a number of customers that</v>

500
00:20:54.738 --> 00:20:59.097
we could talk about.

501
00:20:59.097 --> 00:21:01.217
<v Woman>I know that you can't reveal</v>

502
00:21:01.217 --> 00:21:03.257
their identities in a lot of cases.

503
00:21:03.257 --> 00:21:04.237
<v ->Yeah.</v>

504
00:21:04.237 --> 00:21:05.858
<v Woman>But if you have a couple that we would find</v>

505
00:21:05.858 --> 00:21:07.577
quite interesting to show what it takes.

506
00:21:07.577 --> 00:21:09.398
<v ->Well, there was a lady that came to us</v>

507
00:21:09.398 --> 00:21:11.517
and she was a recent customer.

508
00:21:11.517 --> 00:21:14.377
She has a beautiful concept company, it's going pretty

509
00:21:14.377 --> 00:21:17.238
good too, but she needs to grow.

510
00:21:17.238 --> 00:21:19.637
And the growth, she needs a lot more funding

511
00:21:19.637 --> 00:21:20.977
to take place.

512
00:21:20.977 --> 00:21:23.818
She's an importer and she's a manufacturer.

513
00:21:23.818 --> 00:21:26.677
And she comes from a very well-known line of people

514
00:21:26.677 --> 00:21:29.237
that I knew of growing up.

515
00:21:29.237 --> 00:21:33.457
And she has a great business sense about her,

516
00:21:33.457 --> 00:21:36.017
but she desperately needed the money.

517
00:21:36.017 --> 00:21:39.278
We did an attunement with her and found

518
00:21:39.278 --> 00:21:42.557
a number of things within her own business

519
00:21:42.557 --> 00:21:46.717
that were not optimal in terms of being attuned

520
00:21:46.717 --> 00:21:50.237
or in alignment and through our process,

521
00:21:50.237 --> 00:21:53.557
through the clearing of the faults and so on,

522
00:21:53.557 --> 00:21:56.157
there were such shifts that took place that

523
00:21:56.157 --> 00:21:57.877
the funding that she was looking for opened up

524
00:21:57.877 --> 00:21:59.957
within a 30 day period.
<v Woman>Man.</v>

525
00:21:59.957 --> 00:22:02.077
<v ->Actually, it was even faster than that.</v>

526
00:22:02.077 --> 00:22:03.897
It opened up within days.
<v Woman>Amazing.</v>

527
00:22:03.897 --> 00:22:05.817
<v ->And it came not from somebody that she</v>

528
00:22:05.817 --> 00:22:08.657
had been matriculating along, trying to get money

529
00:22:08.657 --> 00:22:11.597
to be invested, and having conflicts with the people

530
00:22:11.597 --> 00:22:14.557
and their desires and their choices that they'd like

531
00:22:14.557 --> 00:22:16.298
to have for the company.

532
00:22:16.298 --> 00:22:18.877
This came from other sources.

533
00:22:18.877 --> 00:22:20.337
So, that was a pretty neat thing.

534
00:22:20.337 --> 00:22:21.498
<v Woman>(laughs)</v>

535
00:22:21.498 --> 00:22:23.177
<v ->It's not to say that somebody is going to have</v>

536
00:22:23.177 --> 00:22:26.357
great success in one month by working with us

537
00:22:26.357 --> 00:22:28.457
and having that happen, but it does happen.

538
00:22:28.457 --> 00:22:29.737
<v Woman>It shows what the potentials are.</v>

539
00:22:29.737 --> 00:22:31.337
<v ->That's true.
<v Woman>And the reality for</v>

540
00:22:31.337 --> 00:22:32.877
some people.

541
00:22:32.877 --> 00:22:34.437
Another example of where you had maybe

542
00:22:34.437 --> 00:22:36.398
a number of people in the company

543
00:22:36.398 --> 00:22:38.177
and there were parts that really weren't

544
00:22:38.177 --> 00:22:40.738
maybe in harmony with each other?

545
00:22:40.738 --> 00:22:43.337
<v ->Well, I can give you another.</v>

546
00:22:43.337 --> 00:22:45.916
These are recent examples, so I have to

547
00:22:45.916 --> 00:22:47.518
go back in time to think about some of the

548
00:22:47.518 --> 00:22:49.757
case histories we have.

549
00:22:49.757 --> 00:22:52.337
But we have a customer, this is a trading group

550
00:22:52.337 --> 00:22:55.837
that works within the top 3 banks in either the world

551
00:22:55.837 --> 00:22:58.077
or definitely in this US.

552
00:22:58.077 --> 00:23:00.718
I haven't actually checked out how they rank in the world,

553
00:23:00.718 --> 00:23:02.698
but it's a huge bank.

554
00:23:02.698 --> 00:23:04.878
It's out in New York City, I can't mention the name of it.

555
00:23:04.878 --> 00:23:07.317
But the trading group that was working within the bank

556
00:23:07.317 --> 00:23:08.997
contacted us.

557
00:23:08.997 --> 00:23:11.437
They saw our ad in What is Enlightenment

558
00:23:11.437 --> 00:23:15.897
and so we struck up an agreement with them and began.

559
00:23:15.897 --> 00:23:18.537
And in the first month, we went through the initial

560
00:23:18.537 --> 00:23:21.298
attunement and a month went by,

561
00:23:21.298 --> 00:23:23.857
and the next attunement was scheduled.

562
00:23:23.857 --> 00:23:25.617
And when we got on the phone,

563
00:23:25.617 --> 00:23:28.657
there were 3 individuals, one of which knew and sensed

564
00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:31.197
and could have awareness of what we do

565
00:23:31.197 --> 00:23:32.778
would be benefiting them.

566
00:23:32.778 --> 00:23:34.698
The other 2 didn't have a clue (laughs).

567
00:23:34.698 --> 00:23:36.657
<v Woman>That doesn't surprise me.</v>

568
00:23:36.657 --> 00:23:38.117
<v ->They didn't have a clue.</v>

569
00:23:38.117 --> 00:23:39.357
I mean, they were just, you know--

570
00:23:39.357 --> 00:23:40.677
<v Woman>Well, they'd have to have some knowledge</v>

571
00:23:40.677 --> 00:23:42.637
to understand this work. Yes.

572
00:23:42.637 --> 00:23:45.437
<v ->Yes. But, for some reason, they decided to go along with</v>

573
00:23:45.437 --> 00:23:49.018
the lead on their cohort, who was their colleague.

574
00:23:49.018 --> 00:23:52.657
So, the second visit came around and,

575
00:23:52.657 --> 00:23:56.756
"How'd you do last month?"

576
00:23:56.756 --> 00:24:00.717
"Oh, well we had the largest month we've ever had

577
00:24:00.717 --> 00:24:02.537
in our history."

578
00:24:02.537 --> 00:24:04.517
"Really?" (chuckles)

579
00:24:04.517 --> 00:24:06.717
And the other 2 individuals were like,

580
00:24:06.717 --> 00:24:11.037
"Yeah, we did," and we got their attention.

581
00:24:11.037 --> 00:24:12.917
I mean, that's all it took.

582
00:24:12.917 --> 00:24:15.017
One month of a really great month

583
00:24:15.017 --> 00:24:16.537
and then all of a sudden, it's like

584
00:24:16.537 --> 00:24:18.138
there is something to this.

585
00:24:18.138 --> 00:24:20.617
<v Woman>Very good.</v>

586
00:24:20.617 --> 00:24:24.178
And, for example, when working with Dr. Feinberg

587
00:24:24.178 --> 00:24:26.637
and working in that capacity with an individual

588
00:24:26.637 --> 00:24:29.697
that has perhaps health challenge, for example.

589
00:24:29.697 --> 00:24:33.637
He's going through and working with their field,

590
00:24:33.637 --> 00:24:36.317
the information systems and fields,

591
00:24:36.317 --> 00:24:39.137
but getting agreement on a really deep almost,

592
00:24:39.137 --> 00:24:42.177
there are many words for it, but soul-source level.

593
00:24:42.177 --> 00:24:46.197
Agreements as to whether or not the being is ready to

594
00:24:46.197 --> 00:24:49.818
move past this particular impediment or belief system.

595
00:24:49.818 --> 00:24:53.397
And the being is agreeing on a very deep unconscious level.

596
00:24:53.397 --> 00:24:54.657
<v ->That's true.</v>

597
00:24:54.657 --> 00:24:56.758
<v Woman>So is a lot of what you're doing with these</v>

598
00:24:56.758 --> 00:24:59.198
corporations also happening on a deep unconscious level

599
00:24:59.198 --> 00:25:03.177
or do they tend to be more aware

600
00:25:03.177 --> 00:25:07.057
of what the problems are, what the obstacles may be?

601
00:25:07.057 --> 00:25:08.918
<v ->Well, to the degree that the conscious mind</v>

602
00:25:08.918 --> 00:25:10.837
can know what it knows,

603
00:25:10.837 --> 00:25:13.397
there is awareness on some of the issues that are going on

604
00:25:13.397 --> 00:25:16.257
to some degree, but I've always given this image of

605
00:25:16.257 --> 00:25:19.477
an iceberg out in the ocean and the tip of the iceberg

606
00:25:19.477 --> 00:25:22.617
is all that one can usually see.

607
00:25:22.617 --> 00:25:26.937
But what's underneath the ocean is an extension of the top,

608
00:25:26.937 --> 00:25:30.977
is huge, which is usually a gargantuan piece of material.

609
00:25:30.977 --> 00:25:33.938
And this is exactly what we're doing when we go in

610
00:25:33.938 --> 00:25:36.498
and work with companies that most of it,

611
00:25:36.498 --> 00:25:38.657
and individuals to in the healing field,

612
00:25:38.657 --> 00:25:40.237
most of it is unconscious.

613
00:25:40.237 --> 00:25:44.257
We're used to trying to solve, is it this emotion

614
00:25:44.257 --> 00:25:46.778
or this thought that caused this or that,

615
00:25:46.778 --> 00:25:49.177
or is it this particular deficiency in a nutrient

616
00:25:49.177 --> 00:25:51.277
in the healing field.

617
00:25:51.277 --> 00:25:53.037
But when you start working with fields,

618
00:25:53.037 --> 00:25:54.897
you see it's a much larger picture

619
00:25:54.897 --> 00:25:56.697
and there is many, many more facets

620
00:25:56.697 --> 00:25:59.797
than anyone could even have conceived.

621
00:25:59.797 --> 00:26:02.377
<v Woman>Part of the technology that you're speaking of</v>

622
00:26:02.377 --> 00:26:04.677
is scalar wave technology.

623
00:26:04.677 --> 00:26:07.237
Can you explain a little bit about scalar wave technology

624
00:26:07.237 --> 00:26:09.917
to us and how that applies to consciousness in business?

625
00:26:09.917 --> 00:26:12.137
<v ->Right.</v>

626
00:26:12.137 --> 00:26:14.837
We are on a cutting edge, our company.

627
00:26:14.837 --> 00:26:17.856
There's no other company like what we're doing so far.

628
00:26:17.856 --> 00:26:20.377
I mean, there's a lot of probably individuals

629
00:26:20.377 --> 00:26:22.417
having an understanding of some of the concepts,

630
00:26:22.417 --> 00:26:24.837
but because we have the technology we have,

631
00:26:24.837 --> 00:26:27.778
we know for a fact that the way that we're approaching it,

632
00:26:27.778 --> 00:26:30.797
we don't have any other individuals that we can look to,

633
00:26:30.797 --> 00:26:32.777
we are it.

634
00:26:32.777 --> 00:26:36.498
And recently, we have been able to bring into

635
00:26:36.498 --> 00:26:39.197
our whole program with the companies,

636
00:26:39.197 --> 00:26:41.437
the ability to actually create a sound tracking

637
00:26:41.437 --> 00:26:45.677
for a lot of the different pathways that we use

638
00:26:45.677 --> 00:26:48.377
and the different processes that we go through

639
00:26:48.377 --> 00:26:51.557
in helping a company to be upgraded.

640
00:26:51.557 --> 00:26:53.518
At the end of that process,

641
00:26:53.518 --> 00:26:55.337
at the end of our attunement session,

642
00:26:55.337 --> 00:26:57.897
we can actually create an mp3 file from that

643
00:26:57.897 --> 00:27:00.777
and then we can have the vocalization

644
00:27:00.777 --> 00:27:05.357
of all that come through and be actually ladened

645
00:27:05.357 --> 00:27:10.157
onto the scalar waves, which then amplify

646
00:27:10.157 --> 00:27:14.457
and direct the intention on yet a deeper level

647
00:27:14.457 --> 00:27:17.157
to the entity of the company.

648
00:27:17.157 --> 00:27:19.517
And we can do that remotely

649
00:27:19.517 --> 00:27:21.518
or we can actually send them the file

650
00:27:21.518 --> 00:27:24.277
and give them a little, tiny type of an antennae

651
00:27:24.277 --> 00:27:26.777
scalar wave, an antennae that they can insert

652
00:27:26.777 --> 00:27:29.077
into their computer.

653
00:27:29.077 --> 00:27:30.597
<v Woman>Very--</v>
<v ->Or mp3 player.</v>

654
00:27:30.597 --> 00:27:32.037
<v Woman>That's really interesting.</v>

655
00:27:32.037 --> 00:27:34.377
And that continues reinforcing then

656
00:27:34.377 --> 00:27:37.157
the energy that's set been in motion.

657
00:27:37.157 --> 00:27:38.498
That's fabulous (laughs).

658
00:27:38.498 --> 00:27:41.038
<v ->It's almost like out of a new era,</v>

659
00:27:41.038 --> 00:27:42.637
that we've entered into.

660
00:27:42.637 --> 00:27:45.997
And we do this also now in the healing field as well.

661
00:27:45.997 --> 00:27:47.438
<v Woman>And when you do an attunement,</v>

662
00:27:47.438 --> 00:27:48.757
it takes how long?

663
00:27:48.757 --> 00:27:50.837
<v ->One hour.</v>

664
00:27:50.837 --> 00:27:53.077
<v Woman>So you have to be working with something</v>

665
00:27:53.077 --> 00:27:55.597
very close to the soul.

666
00:27:55.597 --> 00:27:58.318
<v ->Well, the intention is pure, let me say that.</v>

667
00:27:58.318 --> 00:28:01.737
And there is an inner knowingness and we're also just

668
00:28:01.737 --> 00:28:06.737
carrying out our end of the obligation or the

669
00:28:07.197 --> 00:28:10.218
responsibility that we've agreed to.

670
00:28:10.218 --> 00:28:12.338
And whatever takes place, of course you can't

671
00:28:12.338 --> 00:28:15.298
direct it, it's going to happen through the grace

672
00:28:15.298 --> 00:28:18.237
of everything that allows us to be here in this life form.

673
00:28:18.237 --> 00:28:20.918
<v Woman>Yes, and the people that are having their</v>

674
00:28:20.918 --> 00:28:23.917
businesses analyzed, the partners, the boards.

675
00:28:23.917 --> 00:28:26.498
Again, the openness has to be everything

676
00:28:26.498 --> 00:28:28.258
because you're going to have information

677
00:28:28.258 --> 00:28:30.398
reflected back and revealed to you

678
00:28:30.398 --> 00:28:32.198
that you may have never even considered

679
00:28:32.198 --> 00:28:33.938
that might be 180 degrees contrary to what your

680
00:28:33.938 --> 00:28:35.578
belief system is.

681
00:28:35.578 --> 00:28:38.258
Does that happen?

682
00:28:38.258 --> 00:28:41.357
<v ->Yes, but generally people have an agreement</v>

683
00:28:41.357 --> 00:28:43.877
that they have certain goals and they're directed

684
00:28:43.877 --> 00:28:45.377
in a certain way.

685
00:28:45.377 --> 00:28:47.297
So, as long as they stay in focus,

686
00:28:47.297 --> 00:28:49.598
everything can be interpreted with a filter,

687
00:28:49.598 --> 00:28:52.218
in its appropriate filter.

688
00:28:52.218 --> 00:28:54.597
And, there's so much that goes on

689
00:28:54.597 --> 00:28:58.558
in a subterranean way that we're not aware of.

690
00:28:58.558 --> 00:29:01.577
I mean, we can't be aware of everything

691
00:29:01.577 --> 00:29:04.077
in the sense of all the little subtleties

692
00:29:04.077 --> 00:29:06.117
of all the zillion of changes that are happening

693
00:29:06.117 --> 00:29:08.218
in a nanosecond.

694
00:29:08.218 --> 00:29:10.598
There's tens of thousands of biochemical reactions

695
00:29:10.598 --> 00:29:12.857
in a cell in one second they say,

696
00:29:12.857 --> 00:29:14.977
hundreds of thousands.

697
00:29:14.977 --> 00:29:18.037
<v Woman>So, is part of this the sheer coming together?</v>

698
00:29:18.037 --> 00:29:20.878
They've brought you in because of what you do

699
00:29:20.878 --> 00:29:22.798
and it's the intention of all the beings--

700
00:29:22.798 --> 00:29:23.957
<v ->The field of intention.</v>

701
00:29:23.957 --> 00:29:25.877
<v Woman>The field of intention of all these beings</v>

702
00:29:25.877 --> 00:29:28.078
has come to clean up the act, to lift it,

703
00:29:28.078 --> 00:29:30.078
to plug back into true purpose.

704
00:29:30.078 --> 00:29:32.417
And is it the intention that's also assisting

705
00:29:32.417 --> 00:29:34.158
your job and them?

706
00:29:34.158 --> 00:29:35.758
<v ->Oh, very much so.</v>

707
00:29:35.758 --> 00:29:39.017
The intention is guiding the whole process.

708
00:29:39.017 --> 00:29:43.738
I've watched certain films and some books on intention

709
00:29:43.738 --> 00:29:48.158
and there's wonderful things that have been said about it.

710
00:29:48.158 --> 00:29:51.498
I can't speak highly enough about what the field of,

711
00:29:51.498 --> 00:29:54.217
I mean it's everything.

712
00:29:54.217 --> 00:29:56.978
As chiropractors, we used to think that is holding a vial

713
00:29:56.978 --> 00:29:59.477
to the body that made all the difference in the world.

714
00:29:59.477 --> 00:30:01.718
Or it was touching of a point to gain knowledge

715
00:30:01.718 --> 00:30:03.458
from what it meant.

716
00:30:03.458 --> 00:30:06.558
This and that was all set up as the field of intention.

717
00:30:06.558 --> 00:30:08.718
Right or wrong, correct or incorrect,

718
00:30:08.718 --> 00:30:12.178
it was all based on fields of intention.

719
00:30:12.178 --> 00:30:14.098
When we found that we could just bypass

720
00:30:14.098 --> 00:30:16.598
and go right to the purity of the intent itself,

721
00:30:16.598 --> 00:30:20.357
and make that the substance of focus for what we do,

722
00:30:20.357 --> 00:30:24.398
then everything changed.

723
00:30:24.398 --> 00:30:26.598
<v Woman>Is there anything else you'd like to add</v>

724
00:30:26.598 --> 00:30:29.117
to this profound work you're doing and sharing with

725
00:30:29.117 --> 00:30:31.558
the rest of us?

726
00:30:31.558 --> 00:30:33.777
<v ->Well, a lot of people ask a lot of questions</v>

727
00:30:33.777 --> 00:30:36.177
about what we do.

728
00:30:36.177 --> 00:30:39.558
I will say that we definitely jump start a business.

729
00:30:39.558 --> 00:30:43.858
We provide a spark or an infusion of shifts

730
00:30:43.858 --> 00:30:46.538
and changes that can take place.

731
00:30:46.538 --> 00:30:49.718
Some people work with us for a year on a monthly basis,

732
00:30:49.718 --> 00:30:52.018
some do just several attunements over the years,

733
00:30:52.018 --> 00:30:54.298
some do a few more, it depends.

734
00:30:54.298 --> 00:30:57.158
There's different ways that we work with people.

735
00:30:57.158 --> 00:31:00.677
But, I do have a few analogies.

736
00:31:00.677 --> 00:31:03.297
One is the stacking of the cards in a deck.

737
00:31:03.297 --> 00:31:06.538
There's always a way to gain a higher probability

738
00:31:06.538 --> 00:31:10.678
of outcome, and working with the quanta,

739
00:31:10.678 --> 00:31:14.098
or what they call the quantum material

740
00:31:14.098 --> 00:31:16.838
and the stuff of the universe that helps to

741
00:31:16.838 --> 00:31:18.637
cull us down into form

742
00:31:18.637 --> 00:31:20.977
and manifest into form,

743
00:31:20.977 --> 00:31:23.018
the quantum potential can be collapsed.

744
00:31:23.018 --> 00:31:24.878
This is what we do in our work.

745
00:31:24.878 --> 00:31:26.718
It's one of the keys of our work.

746
00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:29.618
With the intention, we focus on the collapsing of the quanta

747
00:31:29.618 --> 00:31:31.818
and to probable realities.

748
00:31:31.818 --> 00:31:34.757
And these probabilities are much greater

749
00:31:34.757 --> 00:31:37.517
and give much more choice for the company.

750
00:31:37.517 --> 00:31:40.317
They give more clarity for the company

751
00:31:40.317 --> 00:31:43.018
and they can help actually increase the odds

752
00:31:43.018 --> 00:31:45.998
or increase the stacking of the deck so to speak

753
00:31:45.998 --> 00:31:50.478
for having more favor and being more aligned in that favor.

754
00:31:50.478 --> 00:31:55.298
We also have other types of metaphors

755
00:31:57.308 --> 00:32:00.258
that we've used in the past to try to explain what we do.

756
00:32:00.258 --> 00:32:03.157
And one of them is a computer when it's defragged,

757
00:32:03.157 --> 00:32:05.097
all the kinks are out.

758
00:32:05.097 --> 00:32:07.977
And these are the faults that we are talking about,

759
00:32:07.977 --> 00:32:11.718
Informational faults, and just works cleaner, faster,

760
00:32:11.718 --> 00:32:14.158
easier, more efficiently.

761
00:32:14.158 --> 00:32:16.358
And this is another thing that happens.

762
00:32:16.358 --> 00:32:19.375
We also give the analogy of ourselves as the internet.

763
00:32:19.375 --> 00:32:21.995
The internet is always questing for files and

764
00:32:21.995 --> 00:32:25.235
informational states that have been created either in form

765
00:32:25.235 --> 00:32:29.975
usually, in the form of some type of writings or pictures

766
00:32:29.975 --> 00:32:32.195
or music or whatever.

767
00:32:32.195 --> 00:32:35.015
And the internet has that capability of accessing

768
00:32:35.015 --> 00:32:37.655
and then they have Google connecting to the internet

769
00:32:37.655 --> 00:32:39.655
can access even more.

770
00:32:39.655 --> 00:32:42.255
We have a tremendous capacity

771
00:32:42.255 --> 00:32:45.195
to actually take a step up from the internet

772
00:32:45.195 --> 00:32:48.235
and function from the universal informational fields.

773
00:32:48.235 --> 00:32:50.195
We can access into these fields,

774
00:32:50.195 --> 00:32:53.035
through the universal fields, and through all

775
00:32:53.035 --> 00:32:56.594
the different fields that have an effect on our physical.

776
00:32:56.594 --> 00:32:59.815
And it's all there. The awareness is all there.

777
00:32:59.815 --> 00:33:02.395
It's just a matter of tapping into it.

778
00:33:02.395 --> 00:33:04.275
And through this, in being able to collapse the quantum

779
00:33:04.275 --> 00:33:06.695
potential, is you can bring these probable realities

780
00:33:06.695 --> 00:33:09.355
into your outer, realized experience.

781
00:33:09.355 --> 00:33:11.875
And this is what we've been seeing for companies

782
00:33:11.875 --> 00:33:13.575
that have taken place.

783
00:33:13.575 --> 00:33:15.655
<v Woman>Overall, and this may be an unfair question</v>

784
00:33:15.655 --> 00:33:18.215
and hard to answer because it's kind of getting down to

785
00:33:18.215 --> 00:33:21.975
generalities, but by and large, with the sea of businesses

786
00:33:21.975 --> 00:33:26.135
of all types of businesses and vast array of success

787
00:33:26.135 --> 00:33:29.595
and non-success, how much of our true potential

788
00:33:29.595 --> 00:33:33.775
are we actually expressing, by and large?

789
00:33:33.775 --> 00:33:35.795
<v ->Well, who--</v>

790
00:33:35.795 --> 00:33:39.575
<v Woman>As businesses at large.</v>

791
00:33:39.575 --> 00:33:42.455
I'm hearing what you're saying and we have to be expressing

792
00:33:42.455 --> 00:33:46.115
actually just a small percentage of what our potential is.

793
00:33:46.115 --> 00:33:49.055
<v ->I would say a few percent, 3 or 4% maybe.</v>

794
00:33:49.055 --> 00:33:50.915
<v Woman>That's important information.</v>

795
00:33:50.915 --> 00:33:53.855
That means we're magnificent beings that have another

796
00:33:53.855 --> 00:33:56.675
95% plus expression.

797
00:33:56.675 --> 00:33:58.535
<v ->That's absolutely right.</v>

798
00:33:58.535 --> 00:34:01.215
We have such capacity to grow and unfold

799
00:34:01.215 --> 00:34:04.075
into awareness of what's unifying everything.

800
00:34:04.075 --> 00:34:06.167
What makes everything tick.

801
00:34:06.167 --> 00:34:08.757
<v Woman>And our businesses do too, don't they?</v>

802
00:34:08.757 --> 00:34:11.417
<v ->Absolutely. You know, I was once in a class</v>

803
00:34:11.417 --> 00:34:14.578
and we started talking about the entity of a class.

804
00:34:14.578 --> 00:34:16.597
And it was a group of people studying truth

805
00:34:16.597 --> 00:34:19.857
that gathered together and it was over the course of a year.

806
00:34:19.857 --> 00:34:24.437
And it would be referred to, that this entity that

807
00:34:24.437 --> 00:34:28.458
would form in the class was its own individual thing.

808
00:34:28.458 --> 00:34:30.717
And it continued to grow and evolve

809
00:34:30.717 --> 00:34:33.617
with us as we grew and evolved.

810
00:34:33.617 --> 00:34:36.798
It was a living, breathing, tangible relationship.

811
00:34:36.798 --> 00:34:39.778
And this came to me many, many years ago,

812
00:34:39.778 --> 00:34:41.898
but it's very appropriate to talk about the entity

813
00:34:41.898 --> 00:34:45.177
in a business because it too, is seeking

814
00:34:45.177 --> 00:34:47.497
abundance and prosperity.

815
00:34:47.497 --> 00:34:50.578
It's seeking the laws that unlock

816
00:34:50.578 --> 00:34:52.158
the true abundance

817
00:34:52.158 --> 00:34:53.677
and the unlimited potential.

818
00:34:53.677 --> 00:34:55.858
So not just earning money, which represents

819
00:34:55.858 --> 00:34:57.777
energy out of the universe,

820
00:34:57.777 --> 00:35:00.017
but being able to accomplish great things.

821
00:35:00.017 --> 00:35:01.917
We are so interdependent today,

822
00:35:01.917 --> 00:35:04.538
the companies are effecting each other.

823
00:35:04.538 --> 00:35:07.498
You know, everything is so sensitive now.

824
00:35:07.498 --> 00:35:11.477
And we need to grow in terms of a business awareness

825
00:35:11.477 --> 00:35:15.018
of how we are effecting other things

826
00:35:15.018 --> 00:35:17.758
because this is the truth of how everything

827
00:35:17.758 --> 00:35:20.317
is going to keep going together or not.

828
00:35:20.317 --> 00:35:23.458
I mean, we can't keep playing the same old

829
00:35:23.458 --> 00:35:26.298
experiences over and over that we did

830
00:35:26.298 --> 00:35:28.957
hundreds of years ago.

831
00:35:28.957 --> 00:35:31.598
And even just decades ago.

832
00:35:31.598 --> 00:35:33.457
And times are changing and the corporations really,

833
00:35:33.457 --> 00:35:36.357
even though they've gotten a bad name

834
00:35:36.357 --> 00:35:39.317
in a lot of sense from the public's reaction

835
00:35:39.317 --> 00:35:41.157
to what's happening to the environment,

836
00:35:41.157 --> 00:35:43.558
there are still corporations out there that

837
00:35:43.558 --> 00:35:46.517
are wanting to do good things

838
00:35:46.517 --> 00:35:48.698
and are making conscious efforts

839
00:35:48.698 --> 00:35:51.117
to go in that direction.

840
00:35:51.117 --> 00:35:52.817
<v Woman>Well thank goodness there are</v>

841
00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:54.458
people like you and Matt that are able to

842
00:35:54.458 --> 00:35:56.137
help them expedite that path.

843
00:35:56.137 --> 00:35:58.997
<v ->We love working with these types of companies.</v>

844
00:35:58.997 --> 00:36:01.297
<v Woman>Well, I really appreciate your taking the time</v>

845
00:36:01.297 --> 00:36:03.737
to do this interview with us because a lot of times,

846
00:36:03.737 --> 00:36:06.677
the whole notion of money in world of change

847
00:36:06.677 --> 00:36:09.538
and progression gets kind of a bad wrap

848
00:36:09.538 --> 00:36:12.757
because it's been misused in the past.

849
00:36:12.757 --> 00:36:15.277
And it's been aligned with purposes that have

850
00:36:15.277 --> 00:36:18.278
not been for the betterment of mankind.

851
00:36:18.278 --> 00:36:20.637
So, to know that people like you are out there,

852
00:36:20.637 --> 00:36:23.137
really trying to help these forward thinking companies

853
00:36:23.137 --> 00:36:26.837
express themselves makes me feel better (chuckles).

854
00:36:26.837 --> 00:36:28.118
Thank you, Thom.

855
00:36:28.118 --> 00:36:29.937
<v ->Thank you.</v>

856
00:36:29.937 --> 00:36:32.597
<v ->If you'd like to know more about optimal modification</v>

857
00:36:32.597 --> 00:36:34.617
and how it could work for your business,

858
00:36:34.617 --> 00:36:36.697
please visit his website to schedule an appointment

859
00:36:36.697 --> 00:36:39.417
with Dr. Rodgers or his partner, Dr. Goddell.

860
00:36:39.417 --> 00:36:41.237
If you would like to expand your understanding

861
00:36:41.237 --> 00:36:43.037
of the technology in general,

862
00:36:43.037 --> 00:36:45.057
you can watch our intervew with Dr. Leslie Feinberg.

863
00:36:45.057 --> 00:36:47.877
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.

864
00:36:47.877 --> 00:36:51.668
(relaxing music)
