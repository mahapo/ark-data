00:00:00.855 --> 00:00:02.646
<v ->You may have already been exposed to the work</v>

2
00:00:02.646 --> 00:00:04.780
of Freddy Silva or Art Bell's show,

3
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.689
or at many other media outlets.

4
00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.206
Freddy Silva is considered one of the top researchers

5
00:00:09.206 --> 00:00:11.926
in the arena of crop circle phenomena.

6
00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:13.963
In his book, Secrets in the Fields,

7
00:00:13.963 --> 00:00:16.480
Freddy pulls the pieces of the picture together

8
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.880
regarding what these images mean to mankind

9
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.174
in a way that nobody else has done.

10
00:00:21.174 --> 00:00:24.160
He also tells of the darker history of crop circles,

11
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.186
such as disinformation campaigns

12
00:00:26.186 --> 00:00:28.570
by the governments of the world.

13
00:00:35.252 --> 00:00:36.692
Where did the fascination with crop circles

14
00:00:36.692 --> 00:00:39.288
begin in your life, and how did that come

15
00:00:39.838 --> 00:00:41.560
into form into a best selling book

16
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.789
and also into doing these kinds of conferences,

17
00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.597
and basically, ticking a lot of people off these days?

18
00:00:46.597 --> 00:00:48.100
(both laugh)

19
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.126
<v ->Well, I was actually a million miles away.</v>

20
00:00:51.611 --> 00:00:53.583
I was living in Chicago at the time.

21
00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:54.800
I was actually in advertising.

22
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.933
I was an art director and a writer,

23
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.490
which, for many people, would put me

24
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.157
so far away from crop circles as possible.

25
00:01:01.157 --> 00:01:03.411
Except when you think about it, it really isn't

26
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:07.171
because I used to take 40 pages of written information,

27
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:09.485
I used to condense that into a headline or a symbol

28
00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:11.597
and I used to sell that to a skeptical public.

29
00:01:11.597 --> 00:01:13.528
And now I take a symbol and I extract

30
00:01:13.528 --> 00:01:15.842
40 pages of information, still have to sell it

31
00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:17.304
to a skeptical public.

32
00:01:17.304 --> 00:01:20.164
So nothing's really changed, I just don't get paid as much.

33
00:01:20.735 --> 00:01:22.900
I was watching television with the sound turned off.

34
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.532
I was ironing a shirt.

35
00:01:24.532 --> 00:01:26.912
And I just saw this image come on the screen,

36
00:01:26.912 --> 00:01:30.164
and I just knew exactly what it was when I saw it.

37
00:01:30.164 --> 00:01:31.785
But I couldn't explain it.

38
00:01:31.785 --> 00:01:33.844
It was a sort of subconscious connection

39
00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:35.060
that I just made.

40
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.355
This was an image that somehow I just recognized

41
00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:39.326
and I knew exactly what was behind it

42
00:01:39.326 --> 00:01:41.075
and what it was here to do.

43
00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:43.230
And so, for the next nine years, I was slowly

44
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.788
watching my career go downhill

45
00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:47.901
and watched my research go up at the same time.

46
00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:49.021
<v Voiceover>Amazing how that happens.</v>

47
00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:49.937
<v ->It is, isn't it?</v>

48
00:01:49.937 --> 00:01:51.762
You watch your friends leave, your wife leave,

49
00:01:51.762 --> 00:01:52.903
and your house, you know.

50
00:01:52.903 --> 00:01:54.748
But the fringe benefits are fantastic.

51
00:01:54.748 --> 00:01:57.042
<v Voiceover>(laughs) Okay, so now you understand</v>

52
00:01:57.042 --> 00:01:58.267
what they are.

53
00:01:58.267 --> 00:02:00.028
First of all, this is a phenomena that's been around

54
00:02:00.028 --> 00:02:01.657
for a really long time.

55
00:02:01.657 --> 00:02:04.355
And it's been actually documented since,

56
00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:06.147
I wrote a little note here, 1678.

57
00:02:06.147 --> 00:02:07.363
Is that correct?
<v Freddie>Yes.</v>

58
00:02:07.363 --> 00:02:08.822
<v Voiceover>So if they've been documenting them</v>

59
00:02:08.822 --> 00:02:11.541
for a long time, and they've gone through various phases,

60
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:13.920
let's talk about what's happened in recent years,

61
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.250
say, the 1990s through the 2000s, in the subject.

62
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.267
Lots of controversy around it.

63
00:02:20.267 --> 00:02:22.379
And I wanna talk about some of that.

64
00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.664
But first of all, tell us exactly what they are.

65
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.201
Who are the circle makers, and what are the circles?

66
00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:31.487
<v ->(laughs) Well, the crop circles,</v>

67
00:02:31.487 --> 00:02:34.837
from a scientific point of view, they are areas

68
00:02:34.837 --> 00:02:37.097
which are expressions of energy,

69
00:02:37.097 --> 00:02:38.398
and it's living energy.

70
00:02:38.398 --> 00:02:40.998
It can be documented,

71
00:02:40.998 --> 00:02:44.379
it can be formulated, it can also be measured.

72
00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.446
We've had tons of proof of this for the best part

73
00:02:46.446 --> 00:02:49.272
of a decade now, so that's a mystery in itself.

74
00:02:49.272 --> 00:02:51.629
And what it is, it's a form of electromagnetic

75
00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.615
and sonic energy, which has a component of magnetism

76
00:02:54.615 --> 00:02:56.974
and antigravitational aspects.

77
00:02:56.974 --> 00:02:58.754
And what happens is, where this energy

78
00:02:58.754 --> 00:03:02.238
actually hits a solid area, let's say, for example,

79
00:03:02.238 --> 00:03:05.267
a wheat field, the expression of that energy,

80
00:03:05.267 --> 00:03:08.437
the resonance, will actually create a geometric shape,

81
00:03:08.437 --> 00:03:11.690
just as what happens when you send a sound frequency

82
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.858
through a liquid, and you capture that sound frequency

83
00:03:14.858 --> 00:03:16.822
in a photograph, that's exactly what you get.

84
00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:17.554
<v Voiceover>Or sound.</v>

85
00:03:17.554 --> 00:03:18.857
<v ->Or sound, exactly.</v>

86
00:03:18.857 --> 00:03:20.285
The old cymatic images.

87
00:03:20.285 --> 00:03:22.845
So that's where the connection really was drawn from that.

88
00:03:22.845 --> 00:03:26.257
So it's a living energy field which interacts with the Earth

89
00:03:26.257 --> 00:03:28.466
on a physical level, and it expresses itself

90
00:03:28.466 --> 00:03:31.388
geometrically in harmonically pleasing patterns.

91
00:03:31.388 --> 00:03:33.768
Now, there is a consciousness behind this,

92
00:03:33.768 --> 00:03:35.495
a conscious source behind it.

93
00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:37.959
And we've known this for a while through various ways.

94
00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.763
One, because people have tried to interact with it,

95
00:03:40.763 --> 00:03:43.035
and it sends back messages which are answers

96
00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:45.030
to the questions that you pose.

97
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.523
We've tried to predict where they're going to be,

98
00:03:46.523 --> 00:03:47.995
and we've also been very successful

99
00:03:47.995 --> 00:03:51.078
in then locating exactly where the pattern's gonna be

100
00:03:51.078 --> 00:03:52.944
and what it's also going to look like.

101
00:03:52.944 --> 00:03:55.164
So it's not just the fact that we're predicting it.

102
00:03:55.164 --> 00:03:57.456
It's also reading our imagination,

103
00:03:57.456 --> 00:03:59.141
it's reading our subconscious.

104
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:01.871
And it's feeding back information, in a wheat field,

105
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:04.305
that shows, yes, you can interact with us

106
00:04:04.305 --> 00:04:06.234
to a certain degree, because, of course,

107
00:04:06.234 --> 00:04:08.506
we are electromagnetic beings to begin with.

108
00:04:08.506 --> 00:04:10.459
So, for us to send out thoughts,

109
00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.887
if there's a conscious source out there,

110
00:04:11.887 --> 00:04:14.262
it picks up our thoughts and it sends back

111
00:04:14.262 --> 00:04:16.033
some kind of answer.

112
00:04:16.348 --> 00:04:19.313
As to who it is, now that is a much more deeper question,

113
00:04:19.313 --> 00:04:21.824
and the person

114
00:04:22.223 --> 00:04:24.192
that originally connected with the original

115
00:04:24.192 --> 00:04:27.488
circle making force, because there are

116
00:04:27.488 --> 00:04:29.269
many, many forces in the universe

117
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.859
which are conscious, just like here on Earth,

118
00:04:30.859 --> 00:04:32.436
we have, you know, white people, brown people,

119
00:04:32.436 --> 00:04:33.876
black people, yellow people.

120
00:04:33.876 --> 00:04:36.585
Well, the universe also has all those people, as well.

121
00:04:37.325 --> 00:04:39.318
So it's not just one conscious source,

122
00:04:39.318 --> 00:04:43.237
although the single group consciousness that's behind it

123
00:04:43.237 --> 00:04:45.175
has been around for a very long time,

124
00:04:45.175 --> 00:04:47.872
dictating the very core of the phenomenon.

125
00:04:47.872 --> 00:04:50.766
And they actually exist in our history.

126
00:04:50.766 --> 00:04:52.451
In the Egyptian culture, they were called

127
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:55.962
the Shining Ones, and they were the physical manifestation

128
00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.905
of very, very tall beings, with long heads,

129
00:04:58.905 --> 00:05:00.430
of which Akhenaten, the pharaoh,

130
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.585
was one of the last of their genetic kind.

131
00:05:02.585 --> 00:05:05.102
You still find that in Britain, in Giant's Graves.

132
00:05:05.102 --> 00:05:06.831
And they are literally marked "The Giant's Graves"

133
00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:08.238
on the actual maps.

134
00:05:08.238 --> 00:05:11.223
So they are real, they do incarnate from time to time.

135
00:05:11.223 --> 00:05:13.389
And they needed bigger bodies in order to house

136
00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.405
that extra energy that they bring with them.

137
00:05:15.405 --> 00:05:17.582
So the group that's had the journey,

138
00:05:17.582 --> 00:05:19.735
they call themselves the Watchers,

139
00:05:19.735 --> 00:05:22.861
because they say, and I quote, "We can only watch.

140
00:05:22.861 --> 00:05:25.742
"We cannot directly intervene unless we're asked to."

141
00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:29.039
So what's happened is, at some point in our history,

142
00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:31.650
we, as a group consciousness, as a race,

143
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.731
asked for help and our prayers were answered

144
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:35.436
by this group consciousness,

145
00:05:35.436 --> 00:05:37.590
which some people would call angels, or god,

146
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.204
if you're into a religious theme.

147
00:05:40.204 --> 00:05:42.689
And they said, "Well, these people need help.

148
00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:44.919
"We can't actually help them because that would

149
00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.318
"defeat the purpose of being here on the planet"--

150
00:05:47.318 --> 00:05:48.801
<v Voiceover>And the whole free will expression.</v>

151
00:05:48.801 --> 00:05:50.690
<v ->Exactly. We're the ones we've been waiting for.</v>

152
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.075
<v Voiceover>Our lesson, we're the ones we're waiting for</v>

153
00:05:52.075 --> 00:05:53.088
is our lesson.
<v Freddy>Exactly.</v>

154
00:05:53.088 --> 00:05:55.223
So they said, "Well, we'll send helpful information

155
00:05:55.223 --> 00:05:58.593
"which is spiritual, technical, and healing,

156
00:05:58.593 --> 00:05:59.937
"in the form of geometric shapes,

157
00:05:59.937 --> 00:06:01.056
"which they're gonna scratch their heads

158
00:06:01.056 --> 00:06:03.104
"for the next 20 years figuring out

159
00:06:03.104 --> 00:06:04.769
"what the hell this is all about.

160
00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:06.091
"And that's their problem.

161
00:06:06.091 --> 00:06:08.065
"We're just gonna nudge them in a certain direction."

162
00:06:08.065 --> 00:06:10.827
And so, of course, today, we know that there's technology

163
00:06:10.827 --> 00:06:12.202
encoded in the crop circles, we know

164
00:06:12.202 --> 00:06:14.463
that there's healing involved in the crop circles,

165
00:06:14.463 --> 00:06:16.714
and certainly the wonder that gets you to the fields

166
00:06:16.714 --> 00:06:20.040
is, well, it's all around the world, in 29 countries now.

167
00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:21.999
<v Voiceover>Oh, boy, you've opened up</v>

168
00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:23.768
so many areas to go in.

169
00:06:23.768 --> 00:06:26.957
Well, he likes it.
(both laugh)

170
00:06:26.957 --> 00:06:30.328
See how attractive you are to the natural forces?

171
00:06:30.328 --> 00:06:33.559
Okay, so we have these messages coming through

172
00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:37.313
from beings in another dimension, so to speak,

173
00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:40.908
that have also a long history here in the physical realms.

174
00:06:40.908 --> 00:06:43.786
We are in a time where we have a great need

175
00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:47.194
for some clear guidance.

176
00:06:48.993 --> 00:06:52.565
Can you begin, now, taking some of those themes

177
00:06:52.565 --> 00:06:55.733
in their purest sense, some of the pure images

178
00:06:55.733 --> 00:06:57.972
that have been laid in recent times,

179
00:06:57.972 --> 00:07:00.086
and maybe tie some of those things back together,

180
00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.791
some of the more famous and profound ones,

181
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:04.062
in your mind, before we get into the phenomena

182
00:07:04.062 --> 00:07:06.237
of fake versus real and all that?

183
00:07:06.237 --> 00:07:09.427
<v ->Yeah, I mean, it's a curious language, the crop circles,</v>

184
00:07:09.427 --> 00:07:11.788
because they are a language that,

185
00:07:11.788 --> 00:07:13.629
ironically, is unspoken.

186
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:15.378
It's a subconscious language because it's based

187
00:07:15.378 --> 00:07:17.779
on the geometry of life.

188
00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:19.571
And sometimes geometry is an expression

189
00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:20.701
of its unconsciousness.

190
00:07:20.701 --> 00:07:22.941
It is what it says and what it means.

191
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:25.396
So to rationalize it is actually quite difficult.

192
00:07:25.396 --> 00:07:27.570
However, there are those shapes

193
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.716
which are very cross-cultural, which have been here

194
00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:34.523
for 1,000s of years, scratched sometimes on petroglyphs.

195
00:07:34.523 --> 00:07:36.325
So some of the indigenous cultures were actually

196
00:07:36.325 --> 00:07:39.889
helping us decipher the early parts of the phenomenon.

197
00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:42.425
For example, the one that's on the cover of my book,

198
00:07:42.425 --> 00:07:44.418
which is a huge tetrahedron structure,

199
00:07:44.418 --> 00:07:46.789
which a lot of people actually gravitate towards,

200
00:07:46.789 --> 00:07:48.920
the reason why they gravitate towards it is because

201
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.374
it actually explains how the universe is created.

202
00:07:51.374 --> 00:07:53.815
It literally is the threefold nature of lights,

203
00:07:53.815 --> 00:07:56.801
the seven structures of sound, magnetism,

204
00:07:56.801 --> 00:07:59.074
how these three things hold together

205
00:07:59.074 --> 00:08:01.495
the inside creative matrix of the universe.

206
00:08:01.495 --> 00:08:03.320
Even science understands that, you know,

207
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.943
anything that bonds the atomic world together

208
00:08:05.943 --> 00:08:07.426
is made of tetrahedrons.

209
00:08:07.426 --> 00:08:10.603
So no wonder this shape just resonated with people so much.

210
00:08:10.603 --> 00:08:11.701
<v Voiceover>And that's a common theme throughout</v>

211
00:08:11.701 --> 00:08:13.184
Egyptology, too.
<v Freddy>Absolutely.</v>

212
00:08:13.184 --> 00:08:13.899
<v Voiceover>And the glyphs.</v>

213
00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:15.967
<v ->The Merkaba, tetrahedral in structure.</v>

214
00:08:15.967 --> 00:08:18.954
So they're speaking in tongues which are very familiar.

215
00:08:18.954 --> 00:08:22.381
Yet, to try and rationalize it is a different matter.

216
00:08:22.381 --> 00:08:24.764
There are shapes which appear in the same fields

217
00:08:24.764 --> 00:08:27.452
over the course of nine years, which, let's, say,

218
00:08:27.452 --> 00:08:30.045
in 1919, over in Barnes, there was this wonderful,

219
00:08:30.045 --> 00:08:32.955
sort of long, 600-foot pictogram,

220
00:08:32.955 --> 00:08:35.619
series of circles with rings and connecting straight lines.

221
00:08:35.619 --> 00:08:37.059
<v Voiceover>What's the name of that?</v>

222
00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:39.256
<v ->There wasn't any name that was given--</v>

223
00:08:39.256 --> 00:08:40.657
<v Voiceover>They usually name it by the date</v>

224
00:08:40.657 --> 00:08:41.456
<v ->To that particular one.</v>

225
00:08:41.456 --> 00:08:42.568
<v Voiceover>And the area, right?</v>

226
00:08:42.568 --> 00:08:44.648
<v ->Usually whoever gives it first names it.</v>

227
00:08:44.648 --> 00:08:45.565
Which is actually a bit of a problem,

228
00:08:45.565 --> 00:08:48.156
because people latch onto that and they narrow it.

229
00:08:48.156 --> 00:08:50.438
But there was this long, sort of, pattern

230
00:08:50.438 --> 00:08:52.753
which actually got people all around the world

231
00:08:52.753 --> 00:08:54.396
to come to Britain for the first time.

232
00:08:54.396 --> 00:08:56.102
I mean, 1,000s of people descended

233
00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:58.342
in that tiny little hamlet in Wiltshire.

234
00:08:58.342 --> 00:09:01.264
And then, six years later, we had a DNA pattern

235
00:09:01.264 --> 00:09:04.849
in the same field, which seemed oddly familiar

236
00:09:04.849 --> 00:09:07.099
and resonant with the original image in that field.

237
00:09:07.099 --> 00:09:08.156
And then three years after that,

238
00:09:08.156 --> 00:09:10.144
there was actually a coiled serpent.

239
00:09:10.144 --> 00:09:12.235
Now, you put those three side by side,

240
00:09:12.235 --> 00:09:16.853
and it gives you a story of how DNA and life work together,

241
00:09:16.853 --> 00:09:18.945
and how it works with the Kundalini,

242
00:09:18.945 --> 00:09:21.453
how it works with the Kundalini of the Earth, as well.

243
00:09:21.453 --> 00:09:23.788
So there are multilayers of information

244
00:09:23.788 --> 00:09:26.646
encoded in the symbols, which eventually,

245
00:09:26.646 --> 00:09:30.209
if you give it enough time, it gives you a story.

246
00:09:30.209 --> 00:09:31.467
Of course, we're very impatient to try

247
00:09:31.467 --> 00:09:32.589
and figure out what it is.

248
00:09:32.589 --> 00:09:34.073
We want it on the news tomorrow.

249
00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.794
And the trick that the circle makers used to say was,

250
00:09:36.794 --> 00:09:38.682
you gotta give it time, you gotta let this information

251
00:09:38.682 --> 00:09:41.337
imprint itself on the Earth, into the subconscious,

252
00:09:41.337 --> 00:09:43.672
and then eventually, the tune will be recognized.

253
00:09:43.672 --> 00:09:45.091
You just gotta be patient.

254
00:09:45.091 --> 00:09:47.554
Things happen glacially here on Earth.

255
00:09:47.554 --> 00:09:49.283
They're not quick, you know.

256
00:09:49.283 --> 00:09:51.127
Ice takes a long time to melt.

257
00:09:51.127 --> 00:09:52.675
<v Voiceover>Right, time is not short.</v>

258
00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:54.319
Time is long.
<v Freddy>Exactly.</v>

259
00:09:55.392 --> 00:09:57.141
<v Voiceover>On an intuitive level,</v>

260
00:09:57.141 --> 00:10:00.011
how do you interface with this information?

261
00:10:00.011 --> 00:10:02.646
<v ->Oh, well, I have to come at this</v>

262
00:10:02.646 --> 00:10:05.794
from a point of view of my own experience,

263
00:10:05.794 --> 00:10:08.297
because, I mean, I was raised a Catholic,

264
00:10:08.297 --> 00:10:10.519
whether I liked it or not, and I didn't.

265
00:10:11.429 --> 00:10:13.364
And then I became an atheist, because I couldn't understand

266
00:10:13.364 --> 00:10:15.603
how a "loving God" could do so many horrible things

267
00:10:15.603 --> 00:10:17.363
around the world.

268
00:10:17.363 --> 00:10:19.293
I walked into the crop circle phenomenon

269
00:10:19.293 --> 00:10:22.504
very much as an atheist, but also with someone who really

270
00:10:22.504 --> 00:10:25.735
understood ancient systems of knowledge and wisdom.

271
00:10:25.735 --> 00:10:27.709
And I knew that there's something more to the universe

272
00:10:27.709 --> 00:10:29.718
than we're being told.

273
00:10:30.834 --> 00:10:32.561
The more I worked with the crop circles,

274
00:10:32.561 --> 00:10:35.143
the more I began to recognize that there was an energy form

275
00:10:35.143 --> 00:10:37.724
that was intangible, you could feel it.

276
00:10:37.724 --> 00:10:39.795
And after a while, just like driving a car,

277
00:10:39.795 --> 00:10:41.297
it becomes second nature.

278
00:10:41.297 --> 00:10:43.656
You begin to see energy lines, you begin to see shifts

279
00:10:43.656 --> 00:10:45.830
in perception, missing time,

280
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.125
things out of the corner of your eye.

281
00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:51.269
And after a while, I began to interact with these people,

282
00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:53.178
as I call them, because for me, the people

283
00:10:53.178 --> 00:10:55.957
who create the crop circles, or the beings that create

284
00:10:55.957 --> 00:10:57.845
the crop circles, are very physical to me.

285
00:10:57.845 --> 00:10:58.996
They're very real.

286
00:10:58.996 --> 00:11:01.279
And I did have a very special experience

287
00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:04.612
where one day, out of frustration, I'd go

288
00:11:04.612 --> 00:11:07.688
into one of these designs in the middle of the night,

289
00:11:07.688 --> 00:11:10.629
and I'd ask, "I'd like to know what the connection is

290
00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:14.021
"with sound, how is sound associated with all of this?"

291
00:11:15.791 --> 00:11:18.374
To cut a very long story short,

292
00:11:18.374 --> 00:11:21.870
I started getting this huge white light over me,

293
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.003
in the middle of a field at midnight.

294
00:11:24.003 --> 00:11:26.190
It's the kind of light that you get in the middle

295
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.099
of the morning when you been in bed too long.

296
00:11:28.099 --> 00:11:29.123
The light's coming from the shutters

297
00:11:29.123 --> 00:11:31.065
and it's batting your eyelids.

298
00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:33.507
You can't quite keep them closed.

299
00:11:33.507 --> 00:11:35.010
And it was very, very bright and I said,

300
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.962
"I really don't believe in UFOs or abductions.

301
00:11:36.962 --> 00:11:39.553
"I'm not enjoying this moment at all."

302
00:11:39.553 --> 00:11:42.007
And I was getting very, very nervous.

303
00:11:42.567 --> 00:11:43.819
<v Voiceover>Ready for the probe?</v>

304
00:11:43.819 --> 00:11:46.835
<v ->I was sort of going, "I'm not gonna open my eyes.</v>

305
00:11:46.835 --> 00:11:47.659
"I don't know what's out there,

306
00:11:47.659 --> 00:11:49.214
"but I'm not gonna open my eyes."

307
00:11:49.214 --> 00:11:50.974
And then what happened was, it's as if someone

308
00:11:50.974 --> 00:11:52.660
just hit me over the back of the head

309
00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.024
with a baseball bat.

310
00:11:54.024 --> 00:11:55.724
It didn't hurt.

311
00:11:55.724 --> 00:11:58.615
It was like Doctor Spock, or Mr. Spock, pinching a nerve.

312
00:11:58.615 --> 00:12:00.587
And I just lost all that trepidation.

313
00:12:00.587 --> 00:12:02.369
And the next moment, I was sort of, actually,

314
00:12:02.369 --> 00:12:04.662
not feeling the wheat under me at all.

315
00:12:04.662 --> 00:12:07.265
I was actually floating off the ground, watching my arms

316
00:12:07.265 --> 00:12:09.302
float around me, I was going, "That's interesting.

317
00:12:09.302 --> 00:12:10.519
"My arm's over here.

318
00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:11.478
"There's my other arm.

319
00:12:11.478 --> 00:12:12.854
"What am I doing here?"

320
00:12:12.854 --> 00:12:15.660
And I felt surrounded by a lot of very, very tall beings

321
00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.420
and this sense of unconditional love.

322
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.833
45 minutes later, because the tape that I was playing,

323
00:12:21.833 --> 00:12:24.490
I was playing a little bit of music in the field,

324
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.924
the tape ended, the click switched off the tape recorder,

325
00:12:27.924 --> 00:12:30.144
and I just hit the ground with a bang.

326
00:12:30.577 --> 00:12:32.913
I went back home and I thought, "That was very weird."

327
00:12:32.913 --> 00:12:34.789
I mean, how do you explain all this?

328
00:12:34.789 --> 00:12:37.017
Well, I was in this bed and breakfast with a good friend

329
00:12:37.017 --> 00:12:39.066
of mine who happens to be an accountant

330
00:12:39.066 --> 00:12:40.857
and very good channeler, as well,

331
00:12:40.857 --> 00:12:43.966
which is good use of left brain and right brain.

332
00:12:44.537 --> 00:12:46.275
She said to me, "Well, what happened last night?"

333
00:12:46.275 --> 00:12:50.020
And I said, "Well, I'm not sure if I can really explain.

334
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.576
"I mean, I'm not sure if I dreamed all of this."

335
00:12:51.576 --> 00:12:54.829
She said, "Actually, I'll tell you, they're telling me now

336
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:57.144
"that they took you out of the body

337
00:12:57.144 --> 00:12:59.833
"and they got you into the other level of reality

338
00:12:59.833 --> 00:13:01.677
"to get you into a position of being receptive

339
00:13:01.677 --> 00:13:03.289
"to their information because you wanted to know

340
00:13:03.289 --> 00:13:05.581
"about how sound and light create the crop circles."

341
00:13:05.581 --> 00:13:07.181
And I said,

342
00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:09.009
because I hadn't said anything to her.

343
00:13:09.409 --> 00:13:11.200
She said, "There was one in front of you

344
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.425
"that was doing the guiding, there was three

345
00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:14.376
"on either side, very tall beings, very slender."

346
00:13:14.376 --> 00:13:15.880
I said, "Yes."

347
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.034
"And they're programming information for the book

348
00:13:18.034 --> 00:13:20.147
"you're gonna write," and I said, "What book?"

349
00:13:20.147 --> 00:13:22.088
"Don't worry, it'll all be made manifest."

350
00:13:22.088 --> 00:13:23.580
And, of course, within a year,

351
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.664
I'm in my attic and a week later I got five chapters down

352
00:13:26.664 --> 00:13:27.805
on a piece of paper.

353
00:13:27.805 --> 00:13:28.978
And I still, to this day, I have no idea

354
00:13:28.978 --> 00:13:30.866
where half that stuff came from.

355
00:13:30.866 --> 00:13:32.274
So that was my connection with this.

356
00:13:32.274 --> 00:13:34.589
It was very real, very real.

357
00:13:34.589 --> 00:13:36.837
But you try telling that to most people, and...

358
00:13:36.837 --> 00:13:38.202
<v Voiceover>Well, most of the people watching this</v>

359
00:13:38.202 --> 00:13:40.047
will understand.
<v Freddy>Exactly.</v>

360
00:13:40.047 --> 00:13:42.021
But now I have a great respect for people

361
00:13:42.021 --> 00:13:43.428
who've had abductions.

362
00:13:43.428 --> 00:13:45.134
Not that this was an abduction by any means.

363
00:13:45.134 --> 00:13:47.279
But people who've had out of body experiences,

364
00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:49.924
I really do associate with lots of the pain

365
00:13:49.924 --> 00:13:52.653
that they go through and the ostracism that they get

366
00:13:52.653 --> 00:13:55.108
from people who haven't had that experience.

367
00:13:55.108 --> 00:13:57.198
And believe me, when you've had that,

368
00:13:57.198 --> 00:13:59.096
you believe in God, everything.

369
00:13:59.096 --> 00:14:01.977
I mean, the sense of unconditional love that you receive

370
00:14:01.977 --> 00:14:03.748
is so beautiful that, actually, you don't wanna

371
00:14:03.748 --> 00:14:05.230
come back at all.

372
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:06.510
There's no pain, there's nothing.

373
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.112
It's just this pure, wonderful connection.

374
00:14:09.112 --> 00:14:10.797
And then, after that, you feel very guided.

375
00:14:10.797 --> 00:14:13.561
You feel very supported, as if

376
00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:15.523
no matter where you're going or what you're doing,

377
00:14:15.523 --> 00:14:16.771
doors are open for you.

378
00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:18.596
And then you just let it flow.

379
00:14:18.596 --> 00:14:20.854
<v Voiceover>So what doors opened from that moment forward?</v>

380
00:14:20.854 --> 00:14:22.443
<v ->Well, here I am at this conference,</v>

381
00:14:22.443 --> 00:14:24.630
speaking with some of the greatest minds in the world.

382
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:25.547
<v Voiceover>Unbelievable.</v>
<v ->If you'd told me 10 years</v>

383
00:14:25.547 --> 00:14:27.340
ago that I'd be doing this, I'd have said, "Nah,

384
00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.939
"you know, these are my heroes."

385
00:14:28.939 --> 00:14:30.592
And now here I am, speaking with my heroes

386
00:14:30.592 --> 00:14:32.800
and giving my experience.

387
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.837
<v Voiceover>And become other people's hero.</v>

388
00:14:34.837 --> 00:14:36.285
<v ->I guess.</v>

389
00:14:37.248 --> 00:14:38.371
<v Voiceover>The time needs heroes.</v>

390
00:14:38.371 --> 00:14:39.517
So this is a good thing.

391
00:14:39.517 --> 00:14:40.665
<v ->Yes. Just don't follow them.</v>

392
00:14:40.665 --> 00:14:41.315
<v Voiceover>Right, exactly.</v>

393
00:14:41.315 --> 00:14:43.277
<v ->This is always my advice.</v>

394
00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:45.686
I always tell people that, you know,

395
00:14:45.686 --> 00:14:47.211
one day I might wake up and discover

396
00:14:47.211 --> 00:14:49.408
my compass has been pointing south.

397
00:14:49.408 --> 00:14:50.850
Where are you gonna be?

398
00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.085
Don't follow anybody.

399
00:14:52.085 --> 00:14:53.898
Take bits from people.

400
00:14:53.898 --> 00:14:55.925
Bring in what makes sense for you.

401
00:14:55.925 --> 00:14:57.535
But don't follow them, follow yourself.

402
00:14:57.535 --> 00:14:58.646
Have your own experience.

403
00:14:58.646 --> 00:14:59.883
Because that's what it's about.

404
00:14:59.883 --> 00:15:01.577
It's about having an experience.

405
00:15:01.577 --> 00:15:03.743
And everybody's experience is right.

406
00:15:03.743 --> 00:15:04.863
You know, there's no wrong experience.

407
00:15:04.863 --> 00:15:06.595
There's just an experience.

408
00:15:07.845 --> 00:15:09.555
<v Voiceover>Well, now when you...</v>

409
00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.787
We just have a 10-year gap there,

410
00:15:11.787 --> 00:15:14.037
from that night until here we are at the conference.

411
00:15:14.037 --> 00:15:15.413
A lot's happened in between,

412
00:15:15.413 --> 00:15:17.343
and a lot's happened in this field.

413
00:15:17.343 --> 00:15:20.484
Let's talk about some of the more

414
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.665
controversial elements of what's happened

415
00:15:22.665 --> 00:15:24.321
with crop circles, where they were,

416
00:15:24.321 --> 00:15:26.558
say, in the mid-90s, to what's happened

417
00:15:26.558 --> 00:15:28.467
in the last few years in particular,

418
00:15:28.467 --> 00:15:31.305
certainly since 2001, 2002.

419
00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:33.483
You make one comment that there hasn't really been

420
00:15:33.483 --> 00:15:36.350
anything happening since 2003, which, of course,

421
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.558
a lot of people that buy their crop circle calendars

422
00:15:38.558 --> 00:15:39.865
would not want to hear.

423
00:15:39.865 --> 00:15:41.234
<v ->Unless they buy my crop circle calendar.</v>

424
00:15:41.234 --> 00:15:42.215
<v Voiceover>Unless they buy yours.</v>

425
00:15:42.215 --> 00:15:43.356
(both laugh)

426
00:15:43.356 --> 00:15:45.761
<v ->In which case, you're gonna get the real stuff.</v>

427
00:15:46.364 --> 00:15:49.148
Yes, it's very interesting because it,

428
00:15:49.148 --> 00:15:52.134
the crop circle phenomenon, historically,

429
00:15:52.134 --> 00:15:54.897
also mimics, in a certain way, human development

430
00:15:54.897 --> 00:15:57.595
and how we take certain sacred aspects,

431
00:15:57.595 --> 00:15:59.549
and you watch it degrading over time

432
00:15:59.549 --> 00:16:01.441
into this sort of

433
00:16:02.513 --> 00:16:05.094
commercialized religion

434
00:16:05.094 --> 00:16:08.005
which has no resemblance to its original form.

435
00:16:08.005 --> 00:16:09.809
And I'm watching this now, because,

436
00:16:09.809 --> 00:16:12.006
as you pointed right out, in the beginning

437
00:16:12.006 --> 00:16:13.670
of the modern phase of the phenomenon,

438
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.112
which is from the early 80s to the 90s, I mean,

439
00:16:16.112 --> 00:16:18.096
it was nothing by genuine crop circles.

440
00:16:18.096 --> 00:16:19.546
You'd fine one or two here and there

441
00:16:19.546 --> 00:16:22.541
where a farmer had tried to experiement with chains

442
00:16:22.541 --> 00:16:25.954
and ropes to see, "Well, we can't recreate that."

443
00:16:25.954 --> 00:16:29.079
Even the editor of the 14 Times,

444
00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:31.265
you know very famous magazine in Britain,

445
00:16:31.265 --> 00:16:33.248
even he said that people can't do this.

446
00:16:33.248 --> 00:16:34.880
We've tried it. It won't.

447
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.811
Now, of course, they changed their tune.

448
00:16:36.811 --> 00:16:39.786
You know, they've been infiltrated by other people.

449
00:16:39.786 --> 00:16:40.969
<v Voiceover>And I wanna get to that.</v>

450
00:16:40.969 --> 00:16:42.505
<v ->Exactly.</v>

451
00:16:42.505 --> 00:16:45.889
By 1990, we have this huge sudden rise,

452
00:16:47.323 --> 00:16:49.949
exponential rise in complexity, and also

453
00:16:49.949 --> 00:16:51.953
in scientific evidence, by which time, of course,

454
00:16:51.953 --> 00:16:54.533
you got a religious following coming on the back of it.

455
00:16:54.533 --> 00:16:57.158
So of course, the government couldn't handle that.

456
00:16:57.158 --> 00:16:59.611
Actually, governments couldn't handle that,

457
00:16:59.611 --> 00:17:00.935
because they can't control people.

458
00:17:00.935 --> 00:17:02.439
They didn't know what it was.

459
00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:04.412
And to have people believe in something that's supposedly

460
00:17:04.412 --> 00:17:07.558
extraterrestrial, which in a way it is, is bad.

461
00:17:07.558 --> 00:17:09.502
You can't have that.

462
00:17:09.502 --> 00:17:12.193
People need to be controlled, so the government says.

463
00:17:12.193 --> 00:17:14.463
So they invented something called Doug and Dave,

464
00:17:14.463 --> 00:17:16.684
which is something that eventually was traced back

465
00:17:16.684 --> 00:17:19.244
to the English Ministry of Defense,

466
00:17:19.244 --> 00:17:22.111
from sources from the inside who revealed that.

467
00:17:22.111 --> 00:17:25.151
After that, in the mid-90s, you start getting the phenomenon

468
00:17:25.151 --> 00:17:28.220
going down, and the allowance of hoax seemed to come in.

469
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.961
By 1994, you had the rise of the real phenomenon

470
00:17:30.961 --> 00:17:33.372
coming back, 96, 97,

471
00:17:33.372 --> 00:17:35.451
98 year, which is a peak.

472
00:17:35.451 --> 00:17:37.211
And then it drops off again.

473
00:17:37.211 --> 00:17:40.733
It sort of does a sine wave all the way through history.

474
00:17:40.733 --> 00:17:42.279
It's just like a sound wave.

475
00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:43.922
There are peaks and troughs.

476
00:17:43.922 --> 00:17:46.619
So it rises the energy and imprints energy into the land,

477
00:17:46.619 --> 00:17:47.942
and then it just drops off,

478
00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:49.963
it allows people to do their thing.

479
00:17:50.426 --> 00:17:53.105
2000, 2001, 2002,

480
00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:57.211
by 2002 and 3, you're getting more complex designs

481
00:17:57.211 --> 00:17:59.099
but fewer genuine ones, as well.

482
00:17:59.099 --> 00:18:01.742
So they're almost concentrating the energy

483
00:18:01.742 --> 00:18:04.667
that's going into the land in fewer designs.

484
00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:06.896
And then, suddenly, from my experience,

485
00:18:06.896 --> 00:18:10.735
2003 was definitely the last major genuine event in England.

486
00:18:10.735 --> 00:18:13.539
And from that on, it's just been a sudden cutoff.

487
00:18:13.539 --> 00:18:15.918
Simple circles here and there, as if they're just

488
00:18:15.918 --> 00:18:18.190
adjusting the energy field of the Earth,

489
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:22.137
but more rise in the phenomenon in America.

490
00:18:22.137 --> 00:18:23.757
<v Voiceover>The simple circle in America?</v>

491
00:18:23.757 --> 00:18:25.464
<v ->Especially the simple circles in America.</v>

492
00:18:25.464 --> 00:18:29.122
And Canada, in Saskatchewan, in the prairies,

493
00:18:29.122 --> 00:18:31.704
in Japan, in 29 countries around the world,

494
00:18:31.704 --> 00:18:33.231
including South Africa.

495
00:18:33.231 --> 00:18:35.831
So they're spreading now around the world.

496
00:18:35.831 --> 00:18:39.553
And there's also, even today, in 2007,

497
00:18:39.553 --> 00:18:42.187
we have, for example, right now as we speak,

498
00:18:42.187 --> 00:18:45.752
18 crop circles in Italy, all of which were manmade.

499
00:18:45.752 --> 00:18:47.531
And looking at their designs, I can tell,

500
00:18:47.531 --> 00:18:49.185
they're the same people that were responsible

501
00:18:49.185 --> 00:18:50.423
for making some of the ones

502
00:18:50.423 --> 00:18:53.996
between 2001 and 2006 in England, as well.

503
00:18:53.996 --> 00:18:56.140
Now we begin to see who the perpetrators are,

504
00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.842
and where they come from.

505
00:18:57.842 --> 00:18:59.410
But having said that, despite the fact

506
00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.865
that there is a huge influx now of this bandwagoning,

507
00:19:02.865 --> 00:19:04.678
the fact that a false religion

508
00:19:04.678 --> 00:19:06.789
is almost being based on this,

509
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:08.719
despite the fact that, within this phenomenon,

510
00:19:08.719 --> 00:19:10.993
there is a real sense of faith.

511
00:19:10.993 --> 00:19:12.924
You just have to go back in time to look at the real stuff,

512
00:19:12.924 --> 00:19:14.438
look at the real information.

513
00:19:14.438 --> 00:19:16.838
It does help us to actually look at people

514
00:19:16.838 --> 00:19:19.101
and how they create these false gods

515
00:19:19.101 --> 00:19:20.838
and how suddenly something that's so pure

516
00:19:20.838 --> 00:19:22.746
is denatured over time.

517
00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:24.901
So it's almost, the phenomenon, by holding back,

518
00:19:24.901 --> 00:19:28.111
is allowing us to view ourselves as people, as a culture,

519
00:19:28.111 --> 00:19:30.160
and how we behave around ourselves

520
00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.944
and how we take very sacred concepts and turn them

521
00:19:32.944 --> 00:19:35.280
into something very unspiritual--

522
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.111
<v Voiceover>Cheap and commercial.</v>

523
00:19:36.111 --> 00:19:37.798
<v ->Cheap and commercial, exactly.</v>

524
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.738
It's actually showing us up for who we are.

525
00:19:40.738 --> 00:19:43.319
I think that in itself is also part

526
00:19:43.319 --> 00:19:44.963
of the whole purpose of the phenomenon

527
00:19:44.963 --> 00:19:47.170
because they're trying to get us to see who we are.

528
00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:48.643
They're not trying to fix anything, they're trying

529
00:19:48.643 --> 00:19:51.681
to help us to be the high expression of who we can be

530
00:19:51.681 --> 00:19:53.676
in this lifetime, to take responsibility

531
00:19:53.676 --> 00:19:54.977
for what we're doing.

532
00:19:54.977 --> 00:19:57.836
It sounds corny, but that's what they're here to do,

533
00:19:57.836 --> 00:19:58.958
because we need that right now.

534
00:19:58.958 --> 00:19:59.734
<v Voiceover>Yes, we do.</v>

535
00:19:59.734 --> 00:20:02.635
Let's talk about, perhaps, another "they."

536
00:20:02.635 --> 00:20:05.153
Is there another "they" that would perhaps like

537
00:20:05.153 --> 00:20:07.169
to have this issue clouded so that--

538
00:20:07.169 --> 00:20:08.448
<v ->Absolutely. Why not?</v>

539
00:20:08.448 --> 00:20:09.750
<v Voiceover>Can you please talk about that?</v>

540
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.820
<v ->I mean, my experience has been mostly positive</v>

541
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:12.875
in the crop circles.

542
00:20:12.875 --> 00:20:15.319
But there's been those days where,

543
00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:17.023
and again, the more you come into contact

544
00:20:17.023 --> 00:20:20.488
with these energies, the more you begin to see and perceive.

545
00:20:20.488 --> 00:20:23.455
I can now see magnetic lines running through the landscape

546
00:20:23.455 --> 00:20:25.565
because my energy field is so energized.

547
00:20:25.565 --> 00:20:27.070
And again, if you told me I could have done this

548
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.170
10 years ago, I'd have said, "No, forget it.

549
00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.141
"It's not possible."

550
00:20:30.141 --> 00:20:31.786
Now I can do it, I can dowse.

551
00:20:31.786 --> 00:20:33.472
I can hear things.

552
00:20:34.929 --> 00:20:37.231
Sometimes I go into some of these designs,

553
00:20:37.231 --> 00:20:39.396
and there's a certain agenda going on

554
00:20:39.396 --> 00:20:40.377
in some of these designs.

555
00:20:40.377 --> 00:20:42.404
And when I look at them, I kind of hold back.

556
00:20:42.404 --> 00:20:44.911
I think, "There's something here that is not right for me.

557
00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:46.555
"I'm gonna back away from this."

558
00:20:46.555 --> 00:20:48.622
And when I tune into it, I do get a sense

559
00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:50.680
that there are other entities involved,

560
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.548
in trying to bring their agenda.

561
00:20:52.548 --> 00:20:54.723
And that's when I think where the human

562
00:20:54.723 --> 00:20:56.911
circle makers come into it, because they're working

563
00:20:56.911 --> 00:21:00.301
from a point of view of fear and of hatred.

564
00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:01.805
So, of course, when you work with that energy,

565
00:21:01.805 --> 00:21:03.192
you're gonna draw that energy

566
00:21:03.192 --> 00:21:04.921
to that local landscape, as well.

567
00:21:04.921 --> 00:21:07.352
So, all things being equal, I'll probably say that,

568
00:21:07.352 --> 00:21:09.230
yes, there are other entities out there

569
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.045
who are generating or putting ideas into people's heads

570
00:21:12.045 --> 00:21:13.773
because they have their own agenda, too.

571
00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:15.222
They're working with the dark.

572
00:21:15.222 --> 00:21:17.412
The real crop circles are working with light.

573
00:21:17.412 --> 00:21:19.468
So you have this dichotomy going, as well,

574
00:21:19.468 --> 00:21:21.026
just like we have here on Earth.

575
00:21:21.026 --> 00:21:23.245
So, all things being equal, why not?

576
00:21:23.245 --> 00:21:26.392
I'm sure they're also being motivated by other feelings.

577
00:21:26.392 --> 00:21:27.757
I think the government's actually had their hand

578
00:21:27.757 --> 00:21:29.441
in making several of them.

579
00:21:29.441 --> 00:21:31.211
We know they have paid people off to make them

580
00:21:31.211 --> 00:21:34.155
physically, as well, to throw us off the scent,

581
00:21:34.155 --> 00:21:36.934
to invalidate the scientific evidence.

582
00:21:36.934 --> 00:21:39.809
The whole gamut of human intercourse

583
00:21:39.809 --> 00:21:42.899
is happening right here, within this phenomenon.

584
00:21:42.899 --> 00:21:45.106
And slowly, we'll be able to step away from it

585
00:21:45.106 --> 00:21:47.421
and actually recognize it for what it is.

586
00:21:47.421 --> 00:21:49.661
And once you recognize that, I think the phenomenon

587
00:21:49.661 --> 00:21:51.507
begins to come back again to take us

588
00:21:51.507 --> 00:21:53.747
to the next level of the classroom,

589
00:21:53.747 --> 00:21:55.792
which is already quite complex as it is.

590
00:21:55.792 --> 00:21:56.781
<v Voiceover>It is complex.</v>

591
00:21:56.781 --> 00:21:58.669
And it's even more complex when...

592
00:21:58.669 --> 00:22:00.150
I was reading one paper by you.

593
00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.794
You're talking about an event

594
00:22:02.794 --> 00:22:06.391
where a bit of antigravity technology

595
00:22:06.391 --> 00:22:08.887
was imprinted in one of them, by man.

596
00:22:08.887 --> 00:22:10.946
However, that same technology had been

597
00:22:10.946 --> 00:22:14.167
foretold of two decades prior,

598
00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:17.419
so that humans are actually utilized at times.

599
00:22:17.419 --> 00:22:19.498
Can you talk about that part of the phenomenon?

600
00:22:19.498 --> 00:22:22.059
<v ->That was a very interesting thing, because it also,</v>

601
00:22:22.059 --> 00:22:23.669
in a way, can cloud the issue,

602
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:26.858
where you say, well, some people had been told

603
00:22:26.858 --> 00:22:29.871
to go make crop circles by the forces that be,

604
00:22:30.271 --> 00:22:31.709
the management.

605
00:22:31.709 --> 00:22:33.993
And when you hear that, you think,

606
00:22:33.993 --> 00:22:36.574
"That really makes the issue very complicated."

607
00:22:36.574 --> 00:22:37.768
Then I thought, "Yes, it does.

608
00:22:37.768 --> 00:22:40.296
"But then again, when you look at how the people"...

609
00:22:40.296 --> 00:22:42.867
And I'm talking about very few groups here in England

610
00:22:42.867 --> 00:22:46.995
who, they said, "Sometimes we'll be in the pub,

611
00:22:46.995 --> 00:22:49.106
"we make this design on the graph paper,

612
00:22:49.106 --> 00:22:50.855
"we got the rope the right length and everything,"

613
00:22:50.855 --> 00:22:52.561
and we know who they are, because a lot of them

614
00:22:52.561 --> 00:22:54.322
have been caught.

615
00:22:54.322 --> 00:22:56.765
But what amazed me was when they said that,

616
00:22:56.765 --> 00:22:59.975
on certain evenings, they got to the fields,

617
00:22:59.975 --> 00:23:03.996
total pitch black, they can't see a finger in front of them,

618
00:23:03.996 --> 00:23:06.449
and they said, "We suddenly felt compelled

619
00:23:06.449 --> 00:23:09.276
"to make a completely different design right on the spot."

620
00:23:09.276 --> 00:23:11.163
Now, when you look at what they've actually created,

621
00:23:11.163 --> 00:23:13.340
without a blueprint, without measurements,

622
00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.387
you can begin to realize that, yes, there is a guidance

623
00:23:15.387 --> 00:23:17.433
going on because there's no way that you can go out

624
00:23:17.433 --> 00:23:20.696
in the middle of a field in pitch black darkness

625
00:23:20.696 --> 00:23:23.544
and create a coherent pattern without foreplanning.

626
00:23:23.544 --> 00:23:24.845
It's just not possible.

627
00:23:24.845 --> 00:23:26.755
And it's actually frightened these people to a huge degree

628
00:23:26.755 --> 00:23:28.739
that they've got involved in the research.

629
00:23:28.739 --> 00:23:30.746
Because then they realized that, because they were open

630
00:23:30.746 --> 00:23:33.389
to suggestion, that they were actually imprinted

631
00:23:33.389 --> 00:23:35.031
with the information to put it down.

632
00:23:35.031 --> 00:23:37.453
So one day I went to a channeling session by this woman

633
00:23:37.453 --> 00:23:39.714
who had originally vetted the information

634
00:23:39.714 --> 00:23:42.188
from the original circle makers, and who was

635
00:23:42.188 --> 00:23:44.482
very much trusted by the local police force, as well,

636
00:23:44.482 --> 00:23:45.871
I should point out.

637
00:23:46.614 --> 00:23:48.320
I went back for some of the transcripts

638
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.369
and I asked again during one of the sessions,

639
00:23:50.989 --> 00:23:53.425
"What is the connection between the circle making force

640
00:23:53.425 --> 00:23:54.780
"and human circle makers?"

641
00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.221
And the reply was that, because the circle making

642
00:23:57.221 --> 00:24:00.102
force has to rely on natural principles

643
00:24:00.102 --> 00:24:02.480
with which to create the shapes, in other words,

644
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.368
sound, light and magnetism,

645
00:24:04.368 --> 00:24:06.811
sometimes the conditions aren't right

646
00:24:06.811 --> 00:24:08.229
for them to lay down the information.

647
00:24:08.229 --> 00:24:10.545
Yet the information has to be given out.

648
00:24:10.545 --> 00:24:13.232
So they basically send the information out to people

649
00:24:13.232 --> 00:24:16.176
who are ready and willing to go out and misbehave

650
00:24:16.176 --> 00:24:17.434
in a field in the middle of the night.

651
00:24:17.434 --> 00:24:19.813
They put ideas into their heads.

652
00:24:19.813 --> 00:24:21.253
And I said, "Why do you do that?"

653
00:24:21.253 --> 00:24:22.766
And they said, "Well, it's a shortcut, isn't it?"

654
00:24:22.766 --> 00:24:23.652
(both laugh)

655
00:24:23.652 --> 00:24:24.868
So they've got a sense of humor

656
00:24:24.868 --> 00:24:26.542
about the whole thing, as well.

657
00:24:26.542 --> 00:24:27.395
And that's why they do it.

658
00:24:27.395 --> 00:24:29.624
The information has to go out there.

659
00:24:30.024 --> 00:24:33.286
One case particular recently involves one of the original

660
00:24:33.286 --> 00:24:35.984
so-called Mayan crop circle designs, which,

661
00:24:35.984 --> 00:24:38.565
I've got a lot of information except the one piece

662
00:24:38.565 --> 00:24:39.888
of information that you won't find

663
00:24:39.888 --> 00:24:42.629
except on my website is that the people who made it

664
00:24:42.629 --> 00:24:45.392
were caught not once, not twice, but three times.

665
00:24:45.392 --> 00:24:48.142
And I actually got picture of the crop circle in process

666
00:24:48.142 --> 00:24:49.358
each night.
<v Voiceover>I saw that.</v>

667
00:24:49.358 --> 00:24:50.841
<v ->So definitely manmade.</v>

668
00:24:50.841 --> 00:24:52.302
I even know there's an Italian TV crew

669
00:24:52.302 --> 00:24:53.870
that was involved in its making.

670
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:55.944
But you don't get to hear about that.

671
00:24:57.987 --> 00:25:00.590
The interesting concept about that Mayan crop cliff,

672
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.256
and it's not Mayan at all, is that somewhere,

673
00:25:03.256 --> 00:25:05.061
on another continent, and this is information

674
00:25:05.061 --> 00:25:08.493
which I'm not privy to give out in detail,

675
00:25:08.493 --> 00:25:10.712
on another continent, there is a group of scientists

676
00:25:10.712 --> 00:25:12.941
who are working quietly behind the scenes

677
00:25:12.941 --> 00:25:15.159
on an antigravitational machine.

678
00:25:15.159 --> 00:25:17.207
And when they saw the picture of that crop circle,

679
00:25:17.207 --> 00:25:19.490
it freaked them because that is the blueprint,

680
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:21.538
almost to the actual shape,

681
00:25:21.538 --> 00:25:23.607
of the actual machine they're building.

682
00:25:23.607 --> 00:25:26.071
And they're wondering, "Who is tapping into us?

683
00:25:26.071 --> 00:25:28.279
"Or is someone feeding someone information,

684
00:25:28.279 --> 00:25:30.656
"and we're all feeding off this information?"

685
00:25:30.656 --> 00:25:33.163
And, of course, all of that was predicted 25 years ago

686
00:25:33.163 --> 00:25:35.670
by this psychic who said within these designs,

687
00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:37.824
there will be technological imprints

688
00:25:37.824 --> 00:25:41.663
of the ability to actually defy gravity.

689
00:25:41.663 --> 00:25:43.678
So there you are, it's all coming true again.

690
00:25:43.678 --> 00:25:45.726
And whether they're imprinting the information

691
00:25:45.726 --> 00:25:47.678
and it's going out along magnetic lines

692
00:25:47.678 --> 00:25:49.791
and we, as magnetic beings, are picking up

693
00:25:49.791 --> 00:25:51.966
that information, matter of conjecture.

694
00:25:51.966 --> 00:25:54.770
But perhaps they're putting ideas into our heads, as well.

695
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.901
<v Voiceover>That's an amazing story.</v>

696
00:25:56.901 --> 00:25:58.324
I love that.

697
00:25:58.949 --> 00:26:00.699
Even though it does, as you say, potentially

698
00:26:00.699 --> 00:26:02.788
cloud the issue even a little more for some people.

699
00:26:02.788 --> 00:26:05.742
But nonetheless, it's about as worthwhile to know

700
00:26:05.742 --> 00:26:08.675
that we're being utilized in that way, as well.

701
00:26:08.675 --> 00:26:12.695
Can you talk about the flow of what you've seen,

702
00:26:12.695 --> 00:26:15.512
in terms of the information that has been flowing

703
00:26:15.512 --> 00:26:18.883
through to us over time up to this point in time?

704
00:26:18.883 --> 00:26:23.176
Are you seeing messages, specific messages, emerging?

705
00:26:24.514 --> 00:26:26.157
<v ->The actual meanings, although they're very, very</v>

706
00:26:26.157 --> 00:26:27.981
personal to people, and people extract

707
00:26:27.981 --> 00:26:30.359
out of the symbols exactly what they need,

708
00:26:30.359 --> 00:26:32.514
because the symbols speak directly

709
00:26:32.514 --> 00:26:34.732
to people's subconscious, it gives them the information

710
00:26:34.732 --> 00:26:36.759
that they're requiring at that time,

711
00:26:36.759 --> 00:26:39.905
there is within that an overall overarching meaning,

712
00:26:39.905 --> 00:26:42.796
which is about opening people to their biggest potential.

713
00:26:42.796 --> 00:26:44.867
And it goes back to our collective.

714
00:26:44.867 --> 00:26:46.476
That's the biggest meaning of all, the fact

715
00:26:46.476 --> 00:26:48.661
that we're here for a purpose,

716
00:26:48.661 --> 00:26:50.454
that whatever we're doing down here

717
00:26:50.454 --> 00:26:53.483
is having repercussions elsewhere throughout the universe,

718
00:26:53.483 --> 00:26:57.195
and that's a scientific process, where all our vibrations,

719
00:26:57.195 --> 00:26:59.435
sending out information as radio waves,

720
00:26:59.435 --> 00:27:01.429
is sending them out all across the universe.

721
00:27:01.429 --> 00:27:04.030
And it's interacting with the other levels of reality.

722
00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.918
And whatever we're doing down here,

723
00:27:05.918 --> 00:27:07.646
they've already concerned that there

724
00:27:07.646 --> 00:27:10.470
because they're getting not so positive messages.

725
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.297
And, of course, they're sending them back, saying,

726
00:27:12.297 --> 00:27:14.107
"Well, look, you gotta basically take responsibility

727
00:27:14.107 --> 00:27:15.686
"for your actions, because what you do down here

728
00:27:15.686 --> 00:27:18.513
"on Earth is gonna also influence us."

729
00:27:18.513 --> 00:27:19.931
And that ultimately is what the crop circles

730
00:27:19.931 --> 00:27:21.211
are telling everybody.

731
00:27:21.211 --> 00:27:23.270
It's the same story for every person.

732
00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:25.254
No matter how personal the message is,

733
00:27:25.254 --> 00:27:27.632
the overarching story is always

734
00:27:27.632 --> 00:27:29.605
about personal responsibility, what we're doing

735
00:27:29.605 --> 00:27:32.913
to ourselves, to each other, and also the planet itself.

736
00:27:32.913 --> 00:27:35.812
It's an old cultural perspective

737
00:27:35.812 --> 00:27:37.645
about the change of the worlds.

738
00:27:37.645 --> 00:27:39.491
We're going from the end of this world

739
00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:43.128
of total selfishness, of greed, of old materialism,

740
00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:45.467
overassociation with material forces,

741
00:27:45.467 --> 00:27:48.406
and we're going out into the fifth world of connectivity,

742
00:27:48.406 --> 00:27:50.829
working with the female and the male in harmony.

743
00:27:50.829 --> 00:27:52.268
This is where we're trying to get to.

744
00:27:52.268 --> 00:27:55.141
So that's overall what the message is all about.

745
00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.568
<v Voiceover>Any specifics that you've seen</v>

746
00:27:57.568 --> 00:28:00.395
embedded in there that can have these multimeanings,

747
00:28:00.395 --> 00:28:02.469
just out of curiosity?

748
00:28:02.805 --> 00:28:03.951
<v ->Hm.</v>

749
00:28:04.512 --> 00:28:05.836
Off the top of my head, no.

750
00:28:05.836 --> 00:28:07.902
(both laugh)

751
00:28:07.902 --> 00:28:09.708
I probably switched my memory bank.

752
00:28:09.708 --> 00:28:11.150
<v Voiceover>Well, that's okay, because the overview</v>

753
00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:13.057
is just beautiful, anyway.

754
00:28:13.057 --> 00:28:14.454
Where are you going with all of this,

755
00:28:14.454 --> 00:28:15.776
with everything that you're seeing?

756
00:28:15.776 --> 00:28:17.910
And people, as you say, many have adopted this

757
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:21.877
as a religion, and they're hurt.

758
00:28:21.877 --> 00:28:24.149
They're angry because they're finding

759
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:25.826
that not everything is as it seems.

760
00:28:25.826 --> 00:28:28.928
There's a lot of money being made by certain farmers

761
00:28:28.928 --> 00:28:31.004
in England, to be able to have the...

762
00:28:31.004 --> 00:28:33.477
And the commercialism, to be able to have

763
00:28:34.267 --> 00:28:35.908
visitors come to their land for a fee

764
00:28:35.908 --> 00:28:36.962
to see these crop circles.

765
00:28:36.962 --> 00:28:39.351
<v ->Yeah, and some of the farmers knowing full well</v>

766
00:28:39.351 --> 00:28:42.018
that when they write, "Come and see a genuine crop circle,"

767
00:28:42.018 --> 00:28:45.312
they've actually been manmade and they were paid for it.

768
00:28:45.312 --> 00:28:46.751
And that really gets to me.

769
00:28:46.751 --> 00:28:48.215
But at the same time, it does allow people

770
00:28:48.215 --> 00:28:50.836
to be on the land and experience the land.

771
00:28:50.836 --> 00:28:52.479
Because the, especially in Britain,

772
00:28:52.479 --> 00:28:54.634
since we're talking about this phenomenon,

773
00:28:54.634 --> 00:28:58.165
which is very much, 80%, happening in Britain.

774
00:28:58.165 --> 00:28:59.787
The land is very powerful there.

775
00:28:59.787 --> 00:29:00.788
It's very old.

776
00:29:00.788 --> 00:29:03.913
We have sacred sites going back 8,000, 10,000 years.

777
00:29:03.913 --> 00:29:06.366
So, to be on the land, regardless of the origin

778
00:29:06.366 --> 00:29:08.810
of whatever made the crop circle, is very important,

779
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.027
because people are soaking up the energy.

780
00:29:11.027 --> 00:29:13.896
The problem comes when you start associating yourself

781
00:29:13.896 --> 00:29:16.478
too much with the origin of what is and what isn't.

782
00:29:16.478 --> 00:29:19.378
And I've taken tours of people over there,

783
00:29:19.378 --> 00:29:21.416
and they'll say, "Well, do you think it's manmade?"

784
00:29:21.416 --> 00:29:22.493
And I said, "Well, you know what?

785
00:29:22.493 --> 00:29:24.221
"I know where it comes from."

786
00:29:24.221 --> 00:29:25.682
And if it's usually manmade, and I know

787
00:29:25.682 --> 00:29:27.774
very well it is, I'll say, 'Well, you know what?

788
00:29:27.774 --> 00:29:29.596
"A cathedral's manmade, as well.

789
00:29:29.596 --> 00:29:31.570
"And a cathedral and a crop circle, and in fact,

790
00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:33.619
"an old stone circle, are all built

791
00:29:33.619 --> 00:29:35.142
"on exactly the same principles.

792
00:29:35.142 --> 00:29:37.437
"You got magnetism, you've got the water veins

793
00:29:37.437 --> 00:29:39.494
"under the ground, you've got the sacred geometry

794
00:29:39.494 --> 00:29:42.278
"embedded here, and you've got the sound properties

795
00:29:42.278 --> 00:29:43.334
"with these designs.

796
00:29:43.334 --> 00:29:45.009
"So treat it like a cathedral.

797
00:29:45.009 --> 00:29:46.812
"Forget about the fact that it's a crop circle

798
00:29:46.812 --> 00:29:47.854
"and where it comes from.

799
00:29:47.854 --> 00:29:49.205
"Treat it like a cathedral.

800
00:29:49.205 --> 00:29:50.644
"Now, what are you gonna put into it?

801
00:29:50.644 --> 00:29:52.617
"What kind of intent are you gonna put into it?

802
00:29:52.617 --> 00:29:54.416
"Do you wanna put something positive into it?

803
00:29:54.416 --> 00:29:56.634
"Because if you do, it's gonna amplify

804
00:29:56.634 --> 00:29:58.149
"whatever you take in there."

805
00:29:58.149 --> 00:30:00.282
And if you bring in positive intent for the group of people

806
00:30:00.282 --> 00:30:03.111
on the land, which is already very sacred,

807
00:30:03.111 --> 00:30:04.677
that intent is gonna ripple around there,

808
00:30:04.677 --> 00:30:06.363
the entire landscape, and other people

809
00:30:06.363 --> 00:30:08.111
will be drawn to that land, and they, too,

810
00:30:08.111 --> 00:30:10.362
will take that back to their homes, wherever they live.

811
00:30:10.362 --> 00:30:12.207
So that's where I come from.

812
00:30:12.207 --> 00:30:14.202
I was very angry about the commercialization

813
00:30:14.202 --> 00:30:15.705
of the phenomenon.

814
00:30:15.705 --> 00:30:17.966
It's a double-edged sword, where you either

815
00:30:17.966 --> 00:30:19.385
promote the phenomenon.

816
00:30:19.385 --> 00:30:20.889
And, I mean, I do it as well on my website.

817
00:30:20.889 --> 00:30:23.161
I have to show people what's going on.

818
00:30:23.161 --> 00:30:25.924
But I draw a line now as to showing crop circles

819
00:30:25.924 --> 00:30:27.328
which are manmade.

820
00:30:27.328 --> 00:30:29.152
Because I know that's why they're getting,

821
00:30:29.152 --> 00:30:30.389
they're doing what they're doing

822
00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:33.332
because they get that joy of being on the web

823
00:30:33.332 --> 00:30:36.288
and seeing their work discussed on the web.

824
00:30:36.288 --> 00:30:37.749
It gives them permission to go out

825
00:30:37.749 --> 00:30:38.879
and do it again next year.

826
00:30:38.879 --> 00:30:40.853
So I've stopped doing that.

827
00:30:40.853 --> 00:30:43.092
But I think as long as people stop believing

828
00:30:43.092 --> 00:30:46.079
in something which is not grounded,

829
00:30:46.079 --> 00:30:49.747
at least on some subjective fact,

830
00:30:49.747 --> 00:30:50.952
that's where the problems start,

831
00:30:50.952 --> 00:30:53.023
and that's where our religious beliefs come from.

832
00:30:53.023 --> 00:30:54.942
And those religious beliefs really come

833
00:30:54.942 --> 00:30:57.513
from someone's version of the truth.

834
00:30:57.513 --> 00:31:00.222
And when that version of the truth begins to be unwound

835
00:31:00.222 --> 00:31:02.313
by facts which come to the surface,

836
00:31:02.313 --> 00:31:04.690
you gotta be prepared to say, "Well, you know what?

837
00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:07.207
"I was right, up to the point where I knew so much.

838
00:31:07.207 --> 00:31:09.446
"And new information has come in, and it now

839
00:31:09.446 --> 00:31:11.314
"allows me to believe something else."

840
00:31:11.314 --> 00:31:12.999
If you can accept that, then you're fine,

841
00:31:12.999 --> 00:31:14.973
because your ego doesn't get involved in it.

842
00:31:14.973 --> 00:31:17.064
It's when you attach yourself to a concept of,

843
00:31:17.064 --> 00:31:19.847
that's what I held to be my version of reality,

844
00:31:19.847 --> 00:31:21.734
and now, because someone is saying otherwise,

845
00:31:21.734 --> 00:31:23.665
I'm going to beat them up for it.

846
00:31:23.665 --> 00:31:25.457
And boy, do I get beaten up for it,

847
00:31:25.457 --> 00:31:27.983
Colin Andrew's got beaten up for it.

848
00:31:27.983 --> 00:31:29.658
So many people got beaten up for it.

849
00:31:29.658 --> 00:31:30.959
But they were absolutely right.

850
00:31:30.959 --> 00:31:32.016
They were absolutely correct.

851
00:31:32.016 --> 00:31:34.405
They were just allowing the information to flow,

852
00:31:34.405 --> 00:31:36.357
and they would change their concept of reality

853
00:31:36.357 --> 00:31:38.288
based on incoming information.

854
00:31:38.288 --> 00:31:40.345
And they're prepared to say, "You know what?

855
00:31:40.345 --> 00:31:42.233
"I was wrong about this, that and the other."

856
00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:43.470
And there's nothing wrong with that.

857
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.582
<v Voiceover>I was at that talk when he fist did that,</v>

858
00:31:45.582 --> 00:31:47.647
when Colin Andrews first did that, a few years ago,

859
00:31:47.647 --> 00:31:49.816
and he was everything but booed.

860
00:31:49.816 --> 00:31:50.914
<v ->And it's sad.</v>

861
00:31:50.914 --> 00:31:51.958
<v Voiceover>It was very sad.</v>

862
00:31:51.958 --> 00:31:53.692
<v ->I didn't know he was conducting</v>

863
00:31:53.692 --> 00:31:55.441
that experiment at the time.

864
00:31:55.441 --> 00:31:58.428
And I can say that I, at the time he was doing it,

865
00:31:58.428 --> 00:32:01.489
which is from 1999 to 2001, and he said

866
00:32:01.489 --> 00:32:04.296
80% of the crop circles I have been into,

867
00:32:04.296 --> 00:32:06.587
which is maybe a third of all of them,

868
00:32:06.587 --> 00:32:08.890
so that by itself is just,

869
00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:12.035
his figure of 80/20 being fake,

870
00:32:12.035 --> 00:32:14.254
is actually only accurate according to how many

871
00:32:14.254 --> 00:32:17.358
he'd actually experienced, not the whole phenomenon.

872
00:32:18.778 --> 00:32:20.287
At the same time, I was actually looking

873
00:32:20.287 --> 00:32:21.973
for an-dre-tic patterns for dowsing

874
00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:23.211
and certain energies.

875
00:32:23.211 --> 00:32:25.631
I was also seeing exactly the same correlation.

876
00:32:25.631 --> 00:32:27.872
And I didn't know that he was doing those experiments.

877
00:32:27.872 --> 00:32:30.324
So we actually validated each other's experiments.

878
00:32:30.324 --> 00:32:32.213
And I said, yes, I was starting to see a lot of stuff

879
00:32:32.213 --> 00:32:33.781
that didn't make any sense.

880
00:32:33.781 --> 00:32:35.796
I was getting to see some very complex designs,

881
00:32:35.796 --> 00:32:37.599
but, you know, there's nothing in them.

882
00:32:37.599 --> 00:32:39.241
They were just, I could see the tracing lines

883
00:32:39.241 --> 00:32:41.822
underneath them, I knew these were manmade.

884
00:32:41.822 --> 00:32:43.081
But I couldn't understand why there were

885
00:32:43.081 --> 00:32:44.286
so many of them.

886
00:32:44.286 --> 00:32:48.018
But within that, there's the 20% which are genuine.

887
00:32:48.018 --> 00:32:49.969
Now, why didn't anybody latch on to that?

888
00:32:49.969 --> 00:32:51.474
<v Voiceover>Nobody latched on that day.</v>

889
00:32:51.474 --> 00:32:54.053
I mean, people were standing up and actually yelling.

890
00:32:54.053 --> 00:32:56.730
<v ->I know. Only, it is one that you can't explain.</v>

891
00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:57.647
And that's the phenomenon.

892
00:32:57.647 --> 00:32:58.746
That's incredible news.

893
00:32:58.746 --> 00:33:00.047
<v Voiceover>That was my position that day, too.</v>

894
00:33:00.047 --> 00:33:01.104
I agree with you.

895
00:33:01.104 --> 00:33:02.501
<v ->And it comes back to religion.</v>

896
00:33:02.501 --> 00:33:04.475
The crop circles have now gone away,

897
00:33:04.475 --> 00:33:06.148
to give us time to look at ourselves in the mirror

898
00:33:06.148 --> 00:33:08.707
and say, "Well, we're creating the very thing

899
00:33:08.707 --> 00:33:11.345
"which has held us back for over 2,000 years."

900
00:33:11.345 --> 00:33:12.720
They're built of a religion.

901
00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.512
Not a faith, a religion.

902
00:33:14.512 --> 00:33:16.784
And that's someone's idea of the truth,

903
00:33:16.784 --> 00:33:18.042
not how the truth really is.

904
00:33:18.042 --> 00:33:20.369
Because faith is what your truth really is,

905
00:33:20.369 --> 00:33:21.604
it's what it's about.

906
00:33:21.604 --> 00:33:23.449
And that's why I believe eventually all this will

907
00:33:23.449 --> 00:33:26.119
get back to, about personal truth.

908
00:33:26.119 --> 00:33:28.452
What is my experience, what does this do for me?

909
00:33:28.452 --> 00:33:30.074
That's not what anybody else thinks.

910
00:33:30.074 --> 00:33:31.555
Just, what does it mean for you, and how can you

911
00:33:31.555 --> 00:33:33.369
apply it in a positive sense?

912
00:33:33.369 --> 00:33:34.968
And I think, as long as you flow with that,

913
00:33:34.968 --> 00:33:37.262
then the crop circles take on a whole new meaning.

914
00:33:37.262 --> 00:33:39.502
You know, don't worry about suddenly realizing

915
00:33:39.502 --> 00:33:41.453
that one day you were wrong.

916
00:33:41.453 --> 00:33:43.726
I've got it wrong several times, you know.

917
00:33:43.726 --> 00:33:45.091
I have to go back and apologize to people

918
00:33:45.091 --> 00:33:47.093
and to call them up and say, "Look, I was a really

919
00:33:47.093 --> 00:33:49.974
"arrogant bastard, and you were actually right

920
00:33:49.974 --> 00:33:51.476
"10 years ago, when you mentioned

921
00:33:51.476 --> 00:33:53.674
"blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and now I found out

922
00:33:53.674 --> 00:33:55.538
"through my experience that you were actually right.

923
00:33:55.538 --> 00:33:56.978
"I'm really sorry about that."

924
00:33:56.978 --> 00:33:58.163
And you move on.

925
00:33:58.163 --> 00:34:00.274
You've actually learned something from that.

926
00:34:00.274 --> 00:34:02.257
And it's all about bringing down the ego again.

927
00:34:02.257 --> 00:34:04.519
It's about making you a better person.

928
00:34:04.519 --> 00:34:06.566
And as long as you are improving all the time,

929
00:34:06.566 --> 00:34:08.946
your thoughts are going out in a more positive way

930
00:34:08.946 --> 00:34:11.163
across the universe, everybody benefits.

931
00:34:11.163 --> 00:34:12.337
<v Voiceover>And it makes you a bigger person.</v>

932
00:34:12.337 --> 00:34:14.087
And, by the way, you're a very tall person.

933
00:34:14.087 --> 00:34:16.219
You were talking about those beings in the beginning,

934
00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:17.510
and being surrounded with these--

935
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.285
<v ->That's another lecture.</v>

936
00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.062
I know something about that.

937
00:34:21.062 --> 00:34:23.643
<v Voiceover>Oh, when do we get to revisit this one?</v>

938
00:34:23.643 --> 00:34:25.169
<v ->I'm Portuguese by birth.</v>

939
00:34:25.169 --> 00:34:26.565
I should be about four foot tall.

940
00:34:26.565 --> 00:34:28.090
<v Voiceover>Yeah, well, you're what, 6'4" or 5"?</v>

941
00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:28.901
<v ->6'5".</v>

942
00:34:28.901 --> 00:34:29.723
<v Voiceover>Yeah.</v>

943
00:34:29.723 --> 00:34:31.164
<v ->I know things about my past,</v>

944
00:34:31.164 --> 00:34:33.276
but it's for another time.

945
00:34:33.276 --> 00:34:34.821
<v Voiceover>Can we visit that at another time?</v>

946
00:34:34.821 --> 00:34:35.856
<v ->Yeah.</v>

947
00:34:35.856 --> 00:34:37.604
<v Voiceover>Until then, thank you so much</v>

948
00:34:37.604 --> 00:34:39.999
for giving us some of your time.

949
00:34:41.871 --> 00:34:43.474

As we said in the interview, we'll catch up

954
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:53.389
with Freddy again, to take a look at the story

955
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:55.685
behind the Watchers of planet Earth.

956
00:34:55.685 --> 00:34:58.265
Until next time, thanks for watching.
