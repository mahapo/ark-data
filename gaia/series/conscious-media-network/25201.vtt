00:00:16.436 --> 00:00:18.656
<v ->When we enter into intimate relationships,</v>

2
00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:21.456
we often leave ourselves behind in the process.

3
00:00:21.456 --> 00:00:23.275
Seeking approval and looking for

4
00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:25.156
non-conflicted companionship,

5
00:00:25.156 --> 00:00:27.215
we begin to morph into a creature that we hope

6
00:00:27.215 --> 00:00:29.536
the other person will love or like.

7
00:00:29.536 --> 00:00:32.495
Our personal sovereignty and individual uniqueness

8
00:00:32.495 --> 00:00:36.176
circles the drain and we often become a shell of ourselves.

9
00:00:36.176 --> 00:00:38.356
This is more often true for women than for men,

10
00:00:38.356 --> 00:00:41.496
still, most of us succumb to one extent or other.

11
00:00:41.496 --> 00:00:44.376
Christine Arylo addresses this phenomenon in her book,

12
00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:46.915
"Choosing Me Before We."

13
00:00:46.915 --> 00:00:48.855
Whether you are in an intimate relationship or

14
00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:50.536
have chosen to go it alone,

15
00:00:50.536 --> 00:00:51.822
Christine encourages everyone to have

16
00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:55.082
a love affair with yourself.

17
00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:57.261
Christine, you did something really bold

18
00:00:57.261 --> 00:01:00.002
as a very young woman and I wanted to talk about that

19
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:01.642
because I actually have--

20
00:01:01.642 --> 00:01:03.982
I know a lot of people that took a lot of courage

21
00:01:03.982 --> 00:01:05.601
over a lot of time to do this and

22
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:06.922
usually not til they were older.

23
00:01:06.922 --> 00:01:09.081
You changed your last name,

24
00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:10.522
not your first name,

25
00:01:10.522 --> 00:01:11.542
well I don't know about your first name--

26
00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:12.281
(laughing)

27
00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:14.902
You changed your last name at the age of 18,

28
00:01:14.902 --> 00:01:17.302
because you felt that you needed your own identity.

29
00:01:17.302 --> 00:01:18.781
Can you tell us about that?

30
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:21.621
<v ->There was just always something about my name</v>

31
00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:23.281
that never quite fit.

32
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:24.861
Every time I would say it out loud,

33
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:27.242
and at the time, everyone called me "Chris,"

34
00:01:27.242 --> 00:01:28.881
so it wasn't "Christine," it was "Chris" and

35
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:31.242
I won't even say my former last name

36
00:01:31.242 --> 00:01:32.641
because even when I say it vibrationally,

37
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:34.082
it doesn't feel right.

38
00:01:34.082 --> 00:01:36.402
So, when I was 18, I just decided I am going

39
00:01:36.402 --> 00:01:38.342
to stop using my middle name,

40
00:01:38.342 --> 00:01:40.242
which was "Anne" at the time.

41
00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:42.082
It freaked my mother out.

42
00:01:42.082 --> 00:01:42.762
She's like,

43
00:01:42.762 --> 00:01:44.022
"How could you not use that name?

44
00:01:44.022 --> 00:01:44.742
"That's my middle name."

45
00:01:44.742 --> 00:01:47.041
I said, you know, there's just some name out there

46
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:48.501
that fits me better and I wasn't quite ready

47
00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:51.102
to get rid of the last name yet.

48
00:01:51.102 --> 00:01:53.142
I thought that someday I would go to Africa

49
00:01:53.142 --> 00:01:54.422
and I would meet a Shaman and

50
00:01:54.422 --> 00:01:56.462
he would bestow a name on me,

51
00:01:56.462 --> 00:01:57.442
or I would open up some tome and

52
00:01:57.442 --> 00:01:58.482
there would be the name,

53
00:01:58.482 --> 00:01:59.162
and of course,

54
00:01:59.162 --> 00:02:01.142
that's never how it happens on our spiritual journey.

55
00:02:01.142 --> 00:02:03.582
It's always a lot more simple than that.

56
00:02:03.582 --> 00:02:06.221
Actually, I had moved to San Francisco and

57
00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:08.402
was living there for about six months.

58
00:02:08.402 --> 00:02:09.742
I needed a cup of sugar,

59
00:02:09.742 --> 00:02:11.361
I was baking cookies or something.

60
00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:12.762
I go next door to my neighbor's house,

61
00:02:12.762 --> 00:02:13.962
knock on the door and said,

62
00:02:13.962 --> 00:02:14.962
"Do you have some sugar?"

63
00:02:14.962 --> 00:02:16.382
And she goes, "Oh, sure, come on in."

64
00:02:16.382 --> 00:02:18.678
And this was really the beginning of my awakening,

65
00:02:18.678 --> 00:02:19.817
my spiritual awakening.

66
00:02:19.817 --> 00:02:22.457
Maybe I was a year or two in.

67
00:02:22.457 --> 00:02:24.078
And, there's this little boy standing there

68
00:02:24.078 --> 00:02:25.338
and his mom and I'm like,

69
00:02:25.338 --> 00:02:26.218
"Oh, who are these people?"

70
00:02:26.218 --> 00:02:27.618
And the mom introduces herself to me

71
00:02:27.618 --> 00:02:29.377
and I don't even remember her name.

72
00:02:29.377 --> 00:02:31.558
And, the little boy, who was all of eight years old,

73
00:02:31.558 --> 00:02:33.258
sticks his hand out and says to me,

74
00:02:33.258 --> 00:02:35.637
"Hi, my name is Arylo."

75
00:02:35.637 --> 00:02:38.498
And all of a sudden, it's like lights went off,

76
00:02:38.498 --> 00:02:41.777
my whole body vibrated and I just was like,

77
00:02:41.777 --> 00:02:43.818
"Where did that come from?

78
00:02:43.818 --> 00:02:45.077
"How did you get that?"

79
00:02:45.077 --> 00:02:46.417
and the poor kid was like, whoa.

80
00:02:46.417 --> 00:02:47.537
(laughing)

81
00:02:47.537 --> 00:02:51.998
I felt like a police officer inquiring this but

82
00:02:51.998 --> 00:02:54.058
it was like, it was that knowing.

83
00:02:54.058 --> 00:02:57.558
In that moment, it rang through every cell in my being

84
00:02:57.558 --> 00:02:59.497
and I knew that that was my name.

85
00:02:59.497 --> 00:03:01.798
So, I went home, right next door,

86
00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:02.997
and I had been writing a poem.

87
00:03:02.997 --> 00:03:04.618
I hadn't even written my first book yet

88
00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:05.738
and I had been writing a poem and

89
00:03:05.738 --> 00:03:08.438
I changed the name on my poem to

90
00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.018
Christine Arylo

91
00:03:10.018 --> 00:03:12.750
and that became my painting name and my writing name.

92
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.470
I wasn't published yet or anything.

93
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.930
I just started being with that for a while.

94
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.570
A couple years later, I decided to get married.

95
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.430
I knew that I didn't want to take my husband's last name.

96
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.870
That was a given.

97
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.730
But I didn't want my last name either,

98
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.150
because it didn't fit.

99
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.170
Every time I said it,

100
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.850
it was like marbles coming out of my mouth.

101
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.930
So, I decided to change my last name to Arylo

102
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.750
and it was a bigger deal than I thought.

103
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.170
<v Regina>Yes, because everything changes around you.</v>

104
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.250
When you change your identity vibrationally,

105
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.510
you could go to a soul-vibrational level.

106
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.490
That's one thing.

107
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.110
You obviously were listening to a very deep calling

108
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.211
in yourself, another part of you was speaking.

109
00:03:49.211 --> 00:03:52.788
However, families don't necessarily want to see it that way.

110
00:03:52.788 --> 00:03:54.408
<v ->No, they're very attached to it.</v>

111
00:03:54.408 --> 00:03:56.288
As my mom calls it, she's the "Traditionalist,"

112
00:03:56.288 --> 00:03:57.668
so they didn't get it.

113
00:03:57.668 --> 00:03:59.948
I mean, I grew up in Chicago, so the whole notion

114
00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:02.208
that you could go to California--

115
00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:03.468
You know, first of all, everyone thought

116
00:04:03.468 --> 00:04:04.928
I was a little nutty for moving to California and

117
00:04:04.928 --> 00:04:06.868
quitting my job and doing that whole thing,

118
00:04:06.868 --> 00:04:08.588
but now, all of a sudden I've changed my name

119
00:04:08.588 --> 00:04:10.088
and I'm getting married but I'm having

120
00:04:10.088 --> 00:04:12.549
a cosmic soul-commitment celebration

121
00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:13.688
versus a marriage,

122
00:04:13.688 --> 00:04:16.428
so they're all sort of befuddled and confused.

123
00:04:16.428 --> 00:04:20.088
And, I had to stop trying to explain it to them,

124
00:04:20.088 --> 00:04:22.448
because my mother would send me letters

125
00:04:22.448 --> 00:04:25.828
to "Chris Martin," because Martin is my husband's last name

126
00:04:25.828 --> 00:04:27.108
and I don't even know.

127
00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:28.448
"Chris" is what they used to call me and

128
00:04:28.448 --> 00:04:29.208
I would say,

129
00:04:29.208 --> 00:04:30.168
"Mother, who is Chris Martin?

130
00:04:30.168 --> 00:04:31.428
"I don't know who this person is.

131
00:04:31.428 --> 00:04:33.388
"My name is Christine Arylo."

132
00:04:33.388 --> 00:04:36.088
And it took her three years to finally stop being--

133
00:04:36.088 --> 00:04:36.968
<v Regina>To honor that.</v>

134
00:04:36.968 --> 00:04:37.588
<v ->Yeah.</v>

135
00:04:37.588 --> 00:04:38.308
And it was like, when I got it,

136
00:04:38.308 --> 00:04:40.408
it was just so beautiful to receive that,

137
00:04:40.408 --> 00:04:42.348
but the "why" and the "how,"

138
00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:44.768
I just couldn't explain that to her

139
00:04:44.768 --> 00:04:47.168
because she wasn't in that kind of place herself.

140
00:04:47.168 --> 00:04:50.348
But, what was really kind of shocking to me was,

141
00:04:50.348 --> 00:04:53.588
I got married, in the process of changing my last name,

142
00:04:53.588 --> 00:04:56.088
on the way to Bali for a honeymoon.

143
00:04:56.088 --> 00:04:58.648
I started freaking out, because when I was coming

144
00:04:58.648 --> 00:05:00.068
back from Bali, that's when I was going to have

145
00:05:00.068 --> 00:05:02.348
the court date to have my name changed.

146
00:05:02.348 --> 00:05:04.368
And I was like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

147
00:05:04.368 --> 00:05:06.568
I called my spiritual teacher, Pele and I said,

148
00:05:06.568 --> 00:05:07.468
"Pele, I don't know.

149
00:05:07.468 --> 00:05:09.028
"This is kind of feeling bigger, I don't know.

150
00:05:09.028 --> 00:05:11.328
"It feels like I'm stepping into something."

151
00:05:11.328 --> 00:05:12.389
And she said--

152
00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.568
She's so funny, she calls me "Grasshopper,"

153
00:05:13.568 --> 00:05:14.248
She said,

154
00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:17.528
"Grasshopper, just go to Bali and have a good time.

155
00:05:17.528 --> 00:05:19.548
"And when you get back, all will be revealed."

156
00:05:19.548 --> 00:05:21.808
And of course, it was and I went to the courthouse

157
00:05:21.808 --> 00:05:23.468
and this is funny--

158
00:05:23.468 --> 00:05:25.748
the judge gets up and they pronounce your name

159
00:05:25.748 --> 00:05:26.688
and she said,

160
00:05:26.688 --> 00:05:29.088
"You are now Christine Ar- illo."

161
00:05:29.088 --> 00:05:30.488
And I look at the judge and I'm like,

162
00:05:30.488 --> 00:05:33.828
do you tell the judge that she's mispronounced your name?

163
00:05:33.828 --> 00:05:36.268
I have this whole conversation with my inner guidance and

164
00:05:36.268 --> 00:05:37.928
I'm like, no, you know who you are.

165
00:05:37.928 --> 00:05:40.508
<v Regina>So, what did that do to you</v>

166
00:05:40.508 --> 00:05:45.128
on kind of a feeling empowerment personal level

167
00:05:45.128 --> 00:05:46.988
once you changed your name?

168
00:05:46.988 --> 00:05:50.308
<v ->It was like I stepped into who I really was.</v>

169
00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.748
This happened right around--

170
00:05:51.748 --> 00:05:54.748
it was legally changed right around 33 to 34,

171
00:05:54.748 --> 00:05:57.128
so that's your Jesus year,

172
00:05:57.128 --> 00:05:59.308
when you're really becoming your Christ-self,

173
00:05:59.308 --> 00:06:02.028
so I feel it was like I was anointed, really.

174
00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.968
My first name, Christine, means

175
00:06:03.968 --> 00:06:06.128
"anointed teacher,"

176
00:06:06.128 --> 00:06:08.048
and Arylo, as much as I can understand it,

177
00:06:08.048 --> 00:06:09.948
I've talked to linguists and stuff and

178
00:06:09.948 --> 00:06:11.108
no one can quite pinpoint it,

179
00:06:11.108 --> 00:06:13.948
but it gets "circle,"

180
00:06:13.948 --> 00:06:15.148
is the closest that I've been able to come to.

181
00:06:15.148 --> 00:06:16.488
So, it felt like I was becoming this

182
00:06:16.488 --> 00:06:18.228
anointed teacher of the circle,

183
00:06:18.228 --> 00:06:20.068
of connection, of wholeness.

184
00:06:20.068 --> 00:06:22.328
It just really felt like I was stepping into that

185
00:06:22.328 --> 00:06:25.088
and every time I would write and I would see that name,

186
00:06:25.088 --> 00:06:28.248
it was like calling me into who I really was.

187
00:06:28.248 --> 00:06:31.668
For the first time ever, when someone said my name

188
00:06:31.668 --> 00:06:33.588
I didn't--

189
00:06:33.588 --> 00:06:34.348
<v Regina>Flinch.</v>

190
00:06:34.348 --> 00:06:36.008
<v ->Yeah, flinch.</v>

191
00:06:36.008 --> 00:06:38.648
And it also helped me understand why I never

192
00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:41.048
felt connected to my family lineage, my birth family.

193
00:06:41.048 --> 00:06:44.228
I could never understand why I didn't feel like a Schneider.

194
00:06:44.228 --> 00:06:45.448
That was the name.

195
00:06:45.448 --> 00:06:46.708
I don't belong to this tribe, I don't belong to this clan.

196
00:06:46.708 --> 00:06:49.528
I always felt that way.

197
00:06:49.528 --> 00:06:51.188
It was when I got that last name that I finally felt

198
00:06:51.188 --> 00:06:55.548
that connection to what I would call my cosmic family,

199
00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:58.628
my soul family that I've since amassed,

200
00:06:58.628 --> 00:07:00.808
my big family of love.

201
00:07:00.808 --> 00:07:02.648
<v Regina>Yes, well, it's a beautiful story</v>

202
00:07:02.648 --> 00:07:04.708
and in some cultures, you do change your name

203
00:07:04.708 --> 00:07:06.948
throughout the lifetime at different stages,

204
00:07:06.948 --> 00:07:10.068
that honors what you have become and so,

205
00:07:10.068 --> 00:07:11.768
you just took it upon yourself to do that

206
00:07:11.768 --> 00:07:13.448
in a culture that doesn't honor that,

207
00:07:13.448 --> 00:07:14.768
so congratulations.

208
00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:15.708
<v ->Thank you.</v>

209
00:07:15.708 --> 00:07:18.248
<v Regina>That was a very empowering thing to do.</v>

210
00:07:18.248 --> 00:07:21.328
And the subject we're talking about, the book,

211
00:07:21.328 --> 00:07:23.348
which can be very fun and girly and poppy

212
00:07:23.348 --> 00:07:27.909
and it also has the same time has a lot of depth

213
00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:29.368
and truth to it,

214
00:07:29.368 --> 00:07:33.348
because it's about a search for your own truth,

215
00:07:33.348 --> 00:07:36.008
the genuine connection with yourself which

216
00:07:36.008 --> 00:07:38.248
most of us go through our entire lives and

217
00:07:38.248 --> 00:07:39.648
manage to avoid.

218
00:07:39.648 --> 00:07:42.328
So, with you, you had--

219
00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:44.488
your father left at an early age.

220
00:07:44.488 --> 00:07:46.488
You had a relationship that lasted about 15 years.

221
00:07:46.488 --> 00:07:47.888
You'd had--

222
00:07:47.888 --> 00:07:49.488
not left, your father died--

223
00:07:49.488 --> 00:07:52.108
one come in and one go out.

224
00:07:52.108 --> 00:07:55.548
But you had these schisms in your own being

225
00:07:55.548 --> 00:07:57.108
that had not been worked out,

226
00:07:57.108 --> 00:07:59.068
these dependencies.

227
00:07:59.068 --> 00:08:00.848
Just give us a little bit of background on what happened.

228
00:08:00.848 --> 00:08:02.368
Some people will relate to this.

229
00:08:02.368 --> 00:08:04.708
<v ->Yeah.</v>

230
00:08:04.708 --> 00:08:05.808
So, because my father died when I was 15 and

231
00:08:05.808 --> 00:08:07.248
that created what I call,

232
00:08:07.248 --> 00:08:08.409
what I now understand is a "love crack."

233
00:08:08.409 --> 00:08:11.828
So, Father dies and my heart,

234
00:08:11.828 --> 00:08:14.548
opens, breaks,

235
00:08:14.548 --> 00:08:17.589
because all of a sudden, my primary man is not in my life.

236
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:20.089
That opened up a fissure in my heart for what I call

237
00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:22.409
"the fear of rejection" to come in.

238
00:08:22.409 --> 00:08:25.008
It took up residence in my pure,

239
00:08:25.008 --> 00:08:27.608
my pure heart and that put me into

240
00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:29.548
a 15 year dark period,

241
00:08:29.548 --> 00:08:31.529
when I was dating my ex-person

242
00:08:31.529 --> 00:08:33.748
who turned out to be my fiance.

243
00:08:33.748 --> 00:08:36.608
And, I had no idea that I had chosen that relationship

244
00:08:36.608 --> 00:08:39.948
because I was afraid because of this fear of rejection

245
00:08:39.948 --> 00:08:41.348
and also a fear of abandonment.

246
00:08:41.348 --> 00:08:44.448
They had both kind of taken up residence in my heart.

247
00:08:44.448 --> 00:08:46.888
I didn't know that's why I couldn't leave

248
00:08:46.888 --> 00:08:48.668
this 13 year relationship.

249
00:08:48.668 --> 00:08:50.428
I thought it was because I loved him and

250
00:08:50.428 --> 00:08:51.388
was supposed to be with him.

251
00:08:51.388 --> 00:08:52.468
I thought because that's what you do,

252
00:08:52.468 --> 00:08:54.148
you work hard at a relationship.

253
00:08:54.148 --> 00:08:56.288
And I was really strong.

254
00:08:56.288 --> 00:08:58.848
I was really a strong, independent woman and

255
00:08:58.848 --> 00:09:01.508
so the notion that fear would play any part

256
00:09:01.508 --> 00:09:04.288
in my making a decision was totally

257
00:09:04.288 --> 00:09:07.108
not even registered here.

258
00:09:07.108 --> 00:09:08.788
<v Regina>You weren't recognizing it as fear.</v>

259
00:09:08.788 --> 00:09:10.708
<v ->No, I think if you had met me back then</v>

260
00:09:10.708 --> 00:09:11.988
and said, "Christine, you're afraid,"

261
00:09:11.988 --> 00:09:15.048
I would have said I'm not afraid of anything.

262
00:09:15.048 --> 00:09:17.668
I don't know that I could have even said the word "weak."

263
00:09:17.668 --> 00:09:21.468
Or that being vulnerable was even an option for me

264
00:09:21.468 --> 00:09:22.868
at that time.

265
00:09:22.868 --> 00:09:24.768
I had created such walls, really, around my heart

266
00:09:24.768 --> 00:09:26.828
to protect myself from ever having to feel

267
00:09:26.828 --> 00:09:28.688
that kind of abandonment again.

268
00:09:28.688 --> 00:09:30.008
My best friend was also murdered

269
00:09:30.008 --> 00:09:31.348
a year after my father died,

270
00:09:31.348 --> 00:09:33.268
so there were several traumas that kind of came

271
00:09:33.268 --> 00:09:35.288
one right after the other.

272
00:09:35.288 --> 00:09:38.068
Thankfully, the Universe ran me over with

273
00:09:38.068 --> 00:09:40.828
a two-by-four Mack truck in the form of my fiance

274
00:09:40.828 --> 00:09:42.068
breaking up with me,

275
00:09:42.068 --> 00:09:43.828
on the way to our engagement party.

276
00:09:43.828 --> 00:09:45.028
<v Regina>On the way to the engagement party?</v>

277
00:09:45.028 --> 00:09:46.408
<v ->On the way to the engagement party.</v>

278
00:09:46.408 --> 00:09:47.528
<v Regina>That's an awkward moment.</v>

279
00:09:47.528 --> 00:09:48.128
<v ->It is.</v>

280
00:09:48.128 --> 00:09:49.188
<v Regina>Did you go to the party?</v>

281
00:09:49.188 --> 00:09:50.748
<v ->I went to the party, yeah.</v>

282
00:09:50.748 --> 00:09:52.228
<v Regina>Did you tell everyone you'd just split up?</v>

283
00:09:52.228 --> 00:09:53.268
<v ->Oh, no.</v>

284
00:09:53.268 --> 00:09:54.828
I just pretended like everything was okay.

285
00:09:54.828 --> 00:09:55.628
<v Regina>How awful.</v>

286
00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:56.448
<v ->Yeah.</v>

287
00:09:56.448 --> 00:09:58.288
Well, it was awful.

288
00:09:58.288 --> 00:10:00.068
At the time, I was so--

289
00:10:00.068 --> 00:10:01.468
<v Regina>On a social level--</v>

290
00:10:01.468 --> 00:10:02.608
<v ->I was in shock.</v>

291
00:10:02.608 --> 00:10:05.248
You know, like you get hit by a car and keep running.

292
00:10:05.248 --> 00:10:06.588
It was kind of like that.

293
00:10:06.588 --> 00:10:09.208
I look back at the pictures and I look stunning

294
00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:10.928
and beautiful and you wouldn't know anything

295
00:10:10.928 --> 00:10:13.648
was wrong only he wasn't in any of the pictures.

296
00:10:13.648 --> 00:10:16.128
I even toasted us, my mother toasted us.

297
00:10:16.128 --> 00:10:19.028
<v Regina>You were on auto-pilot program by then.</v>

298
00:10:19.028 --> 00:10:20.748
<v ->Oh yeah, I was on auto-pilot right up</v>

299
00:10:20.748 --> 00:10:22.868
the escalator to death, is what I call it.

300
00:10:22.868 --> 00:10:25.188
Knowing that I wasn't living my true path,

301
00:10:25.188 --> 00:10:27.368
and obviously the Universe had other plans for me

302
00:10:27.368 --> 00:10:29.468
and so, fast-forward two weeks.

303
00:10:29.468 --> 00:10:31.848
After crying my eyes out every day

304
00:10:31.848 --> 00:10:34.928
to beg this man to take me back.

305
00:10:34.928 --> 00:10:36.388
Here I was, strong independent woman,

306
00:10:36.388 --> 00:10:37.668
getting my MBA,

307
00:10:37.668 --> 00:10:39.648
marketing executive,

308
00:10:39.648 --> 00:10:41.608
successful at all levels, outwardly very happy,

309
00:10:41.608 --> 00:10:44.928
begging a man to take me back.

310
00:10:44.928 --> 00:10:46.308
<v Regina>And a man that wasn't really serving</v>

311
00:10:46.308 --> 00:10:49.088
the "We" part very well for you.

312
00:10:49.088 --> 00:10:50.128
<v ->Well, we weren't a "We."</v>

313
00:10:50.128 --> 00:10:51.748
We were stuck in each other's holes.

314
00:10:51.748 --> 00:10:53.268
I was stuck in his holes,

315
00:10:53.268 --> 00:10:55.768
he was stuck in mine and so when he got pulled out,

316
00:10:55.768 --> 00:10:58.568
when he extricated himself out of those love cracks

317
00:10:58.568 --> 00:11:00.528
that I had stuffed him into,

318
00:11:00.528 --> 00:11:04.048
all of a sudden I was just this pain gushing out of me.

319
00:11:04.048 --> 00:11:06.168
I had always thought when we'd broke up in the past

320
00:11:06.168 --> 00:11:07.568
that the breakup,

321
00:11:07.568 --> 00:11:09.128
that him not being in my heart,

322
00:11:09.128 --> 00:11:10.788
was him missing in that pain.

323
00:11:10.788 --> 00:11:13.088
What I realized that first night that I spent the night

324
00:11:13.088 --> 00:11:16.648
by myself in my own bed for the first time in 15 years

325
00:11:16.648 --> 00:11:17.808
was--

326
00:11:17.808 --> 00:11:19.188
actually it was my intuition said to me,

327
00:11:19.188 --> 00:11:21.148
"Christine, your heart hurts not because he's missing,

328
00:11:21.148 --> 00:11:23.508
"your heart hurts because you're missing."

329
00:11:23.508 --> 00:11:25.388
<v Regina>Right.</v>

330
00:11:25.388 --> 00:11:28.048
<v ->And I hadn't listened to her for a really long time.</v>

331
00:11:28.048 --> 00:11:31.268
So, she kept talking because she had more to say

332
00:11:31.268 --> 00:11:32.408
and she said,

333
00:11:32.408 --> 00:11:34.069
"You know, Christine, you've got a lot of self-esteem,

334
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:35.608
"You have a lot of self-confidence.

335
00:11:35.608 --> 00:11:37.708
"That's not the same as self-love.

336
00:11:37.708 --> 00:11:39.189
"You don't love yourself and

337
00:11:39.189 --> 00:11:40.949
"you don't even know what that is."

338
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:42.069
<v Regina>I would dare to say that</v>

339
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:44.309
most women in particular,

340
00:11:44.309 --> 00:11:46.408
and most men, but it's a very different kind of

341
00:11:46.408 --> 00:11:49.449
self-love or self-appreciation process

342
00:11:49.449 --> 00:11:51.348
between men and women for the most part,

343
00:11:51.348 --> 00:11:55.408
but most women really don't.

344
00:11:55.408 --> 00:11:56.168
<v ->We don't--</v>

345
00:11:56.168 --> 00:11:59.468
<v Regina>And you don't know what that even feels like.</v>

346
00:11:59.468 --> 00:12:00.949
Not quite sure about that one.

347
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:01.888
<v ->Or what it even means.</v>

348
00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:02.588
<v Regina>What it means.</v>

349
00:12:02.588 --> 00:12:04.588
And you define it nicely, I think.

350
00:12:04.588 --> 00:12:05.408
<v ->Thank you.</v>

351
00:12:05.408 --> 00:12:07.508
It's been a ten year journey.

352
00:12:07.508 --> 00:12:08.888
That night, that same night,

353
00:12:08.888 --> 00:12:10.208
I actually made a vow to myself.

354
00:12:10.208 --> 00:12:11.248
The vow was--

355
00:12:11.248 --> 00:12:12.048
two vows actually.

356
00:12:12.048 --> 00:12:13.148
"I will fall in love with myself."

357
00:12:13.148 --> 00:12:14.488
I had no frickin' clue what that means,

358
00:12:14.488 --> 00:12:15.809
but I will do that and

359
00:12:15.809 --> 00:12:17.528
two, I will never settle again for less than

360
00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:19.608
my heart and soul desire.

361
00:12:19.608 --> 00:12:21.449
<v Regina>And this is a big one.</v>

362
00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:24.648
This is a big one for all of humanity.

363
00:12:24.648 --> 00:12:27.048
We don't actually, by the time we start making

364
00:12:27.048 --> 00:12:28.928
our initial choices in life,

365
00:12:28.928 --> 00:12:32.328
we're young, so we can cut ourselves some slack.

366
00:12:32.328 --> 00:12:34.628
We don't have a lot of experience.

367
00:12:34.628 --> 00:12:36.288
That's partially because we're not encouraged

368
00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:39.668
to use our intuition from an early age.

369
00:12:39.668 --> 00:12:41.648
If we were using our full Mind,

370
00:12:41.648 --> 00:12:45.008
Mind with the big "M" and with the small "m,"

371
00:12:45.008 --> 00:12:49.148
we would know very early on what we truly want

372
00:12:49.148 --> 00:12:50.968
and what is not going to work well for us

373
00:12:50.968 --> 00:12:54.189
and really cut this process down by a couple decades.

374
00:12:54.189 --> 00:12:57.069
<v ->Well, the truth is that we are actually</v>

375
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:58.828
born in love with ourselves and we are definitely

376
00:12:58.828 --> 00:13:00.449
born connected to our intuition.

377
00:13:00.449 --> 00:13:02.128
Those things are intact, right?

378
00:13:02.128 --> 00:13:03.868
<v Regina>Those things are beaten out of you</v>

379
00:13:03.868 --> 00:13:05.388
through societal conditioning.

380
00:13:05.388 --> 00:13:06.949
<v ->It is and you know why?</v>

381
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:08.908
Because if we actually listened and

382
00:13:08.908 --> 00:13:10.868
trusted our intuition,

383
00:13:10.868 --> 00:13:12.668
which is one of the other vows that I really

384
00:13:12.668 --> 00:13:13.868
recommend everyone takes is

385
00:13:13.868 --> 00:13:15.368
"I trust myself."

386
00:13:15.368 --> 00:13:17.168
If we actually did trust ourselves

387
00:13:17.168 --> 00:13:18.848
and we acted on our intuition,

388
00:13:18.848 --> 00:13:20.508
we wouldn't be controlled by anyone

389
00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:21.928
or anything else.

390
00:13:21.928 --> 00:13:24.788
So, our intuition and especially for women,

391
00:13:24.788 --> 00:13:25.928
our intuition and that word,

392
00:13:25.928 --> 00:13:27.288
"intuition" versus "gut."

393
00:13:27.288 --> 00:13:29.248
A lot of times as women we're brought up

394
00:13:29.248 --> 00:13:30.708
to believe okay, trust your gut,

395
00:13:30.708 --> 00:13:31.949
but when you walk into a boardroom

396
00:13:31.949 --> 00:13:33.228
and say "I trust my intuition,"

397
00:13:33.228 --> 00:13:35.288
you're not necessarily going to do that.

398
00:13:35.288 --> 00:13:37.689
And it's because our power as women,

399
00:13:37.689 --> 00:13:39.288
and as men, does come from our intuition,

400
00:13:39.288 --> 00:13:41.248
which, of course, is our connection to the divine.

401
00:13:41.248 --> 00:13:43.488
If we just operated on that,

402
00:13:43.488 --> 00:13:44.809
why would we have to listen to Wall Street?

403
00:13:44.809 --> 00:13:45.868
Why would we have to listen to CNN?

404
00:13:45.868 --> 00:13:47.328
Why would we have to listen to any educational,

405
00:13:47.328 --> 00:13:48.728
any religious, any institution other than

406
00:13:48.728 --> 00:13:50.548
our own heart and our own soul?

407
00:13:50.548 --> 00:13:51.788
We wouldn't.

408
00:13:51.788 --> 00:13:53.628
That has to be the first connection point,

409
00:13:53.628 --> 00:13:55.908
what I call the first gate of self-love.

410
00:13:55.908 --> 00:13:57.848
So, what happened for me ten years ago,

411
00:13:57.848 --> 00:14:00.088
when I said I will fall in love with myself,

412
00:14:00.088 --> 00:14:03.408
I have since passed through five gates of self-love

413
00:14:03.408 --> 00:14:04.968
because every time I would get to a place where

414
00:14:04.968 --> 00:14:07.088
I'm like, "Okay, I love myself,"

415
00:14:07.088 --> 00:14:08.268
it would be like

416
00:14:08.268 --> 00:14:09.368
"I really love myself this way

417
00:14:09.368 --> 00:14:11.768
"and here's another place that needs love."

418
00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:15.488
And that's the thing about falling in love with ourselves

419
00:14:15.488 --> 00:14:18.228
and the word "self-love" is important.

420
00:14:18.228 --> 00:14:19.968
That's not self-esteem, because love is

421
00:14:19.968 --> 00:14:21.809
a different vibration.

422
00:14:21.809 --> 00:14:23.648
Love's a different vibration than

423
00:14:23.648 --> 00:14:25.048
esteem and confidence and acceptance.

424
00:14:25.048 --> 00:14:27.268
Those are all parts of self-love,

425
00:14:27.268 --> 00:14:29.608
but self-love is the whole.

426
00:14:29.608 --> 00:14:32.568
<v Regina>I'm going to hop forward a little bit</v>

427
00:14:32.568 --> 00:14:36.228
in that calling it "self-love,"

428
00:14:36.228 --> 00:14:37.908
a lot of times as soon as you say that,

429
00:14:37.908 --> 00:14:40.488
people are so disconnected from self-love

430
00:14:40.488 --> 00:14:43.228
that it's like, I don't even know how

431
00:14:43.228 --> 00:14:45.808
to go about that journey.

432
00:14:45.808 --> 00:14:48.348
Even people who say,

433
00:14:48.348 --> 00:14:50.068
"Oh, I love myself," often just means

434
00:14:50.068 --> 00:14:52.408
"No, I like certain things about myself

435
00:14:52.408 --> 00:14:53.648
"that I do well."

436
00:14:53.648 --> 00:14:55.088
That's maybe what that means.

437
00:14:55.088 --> 00:14:56.488
You're talking about a much more

438
00:14:56.488 --> 00:14:57.828
embracing vibration.

439
00:14:57.828 --> 00:14:58.708
Might it--

440
00:14:58.708 --> 00:15:02.768
is there another way to term that,

441
00:15:02.768 --> 00:15:03.788
even though that is accurate?

442
00:15:03.788 --> 00:15:04.748
Because I notice in the book,

443
00:15:04.748 --> 00:15:05.988
when you're talking about loving ourselves,

444
00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:07.328
you're actually breaking it down into

445
00:15:07.328 --> 00:15:11.088
taking the earnest journey to know thyself,

446
00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:15.668
warts and all and that honesty and acceptance

447
00:15:15.668 --> 00:15:18.348
and accepting oneself.

448
00:15:18.348 --> 00:15:20.688
Then, it goes into the more sublime parts

449
00:15:20.688 --> 00:15:25.688
which is living fully with our truest innate

450
00:15:25.848 --> 00:15:28.728
desires and passions.

451
00:15:28.728 --> 00:15:31.788
So, I'm just saying, is there another way

452
00:15:31.788 --> 00:15:34.228
to say it that people can be comfortable

453
00:15:34.228 --> 00:15:36.588
with and not reject because they don't know

454
00:15:36.588 --> 00:15:38.528
what it feels like in that term?

455
00:15:38.528 --> 00:15:40.408
We know how to spend love and

456
00:15:40.408 --> 00:15:41.668
put it onto others, right?

457
00:15:41.668 --> 00:15:44.108
<v ->So, two answers to that.</v>

458
00:15:44.108 --> 00:15:45.848
No.

459
00:15:45.848 --> 00:15:47.108
It's part of my job.

460
00:15:47.108 --> 00:15:48.588
I know this is part of why I'm here,

461
00:15:48.588 --> 00:15:50.028
why God woke me up and said,

462
00:15:50.028 --> 00:15:52.284
"You will be Arylo and you go out there,"

463
00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:55.324
is that we are in a transition in our planet

464
00:15:55.324 --> 00:15:56.663
from fear to love,

465
00:15:56.663 --> 00:15:57.743
that's where we're at.

466
00:15:57.743 --> 00:16:01.783
It's like a war, like this whole science fiction thing.

467
00:16:01.783 --> 00:16:03.644
Team Love, Team Fear.

468
00:16:03.644 --> 00:16:05.204
Which team are you going to be on?

469
00:16:05.204 --> 00:16:06.223
You know?

470
00:16:06.223 --> 00:16:08.404
And there's something about claiming

471
00:16:08.404 --> 00:16:10.123
the vibration of love.

472
00:16:10.123 --> 00:16:11.604
We don't have a problem if I were to say

473
00:16:11.604 --> 00:16:13.444
I really love you, right?

474
00:16:13.444 --> 00:16:15.264
There's no one that's going to look at me

475
00:16:15.264 --> 00:16:16.023
and go,

476
00:16:16.023 --> 00:16:17.463
"She's selfish" because I'm loving you.

477
00:16:17.463 --> 00:16:18.603
You're going to look at me and go,

478
00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:19.924
"That's a good woman," right?

479
00:16:19.924 --> 00:16:23.203
Turn that love around to myself,

480
00:16:23.203 --> 00:16:25.343
why wouldn't we think the same thing?

481
00:16:25.343 --> 00:16:26.603
It's the same thing.

482
00:16:26.603 --> 00:16:28.103
It's the same vibration.

483
00:16:28.103 --> 00:16:29.523
It's the same energy.

484
00:16:29.523 --> 00:16:31.163
So, we are in the process of really

485
00:16:31.163 --> 00:16:33.783
raising up our vibration as a planet

486
00:16:33.783 --> 00:16:36.844
and as people so I know my job is actually

487
00:16:36.844 --> 00:16:40.704
to make self-love as everyday as self-esteem

488
00:16:40.704 --> 00:16:43.303
and to reclaim the definition of it and

489
00:16:43.303 --> 00:16:46.004
leave behind these fear-based beliefs,

490
00:16:46.004 --> 00:16:48.644
that it's narcissism, that it's selfish,

491
00:16:48.644 --> 00:16:50.384
that it's vain, that it's conceited.

492
00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:52.344
Spiritual teachers for thousands of years

493
00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:56.123
including Buddha, Rumi, Jesus Christ all said,

494
00:16:56.123 --> 00:16:58.583
Louise Hay, the grandmother of self-love,

495
00:16:58.583 --> 00:17:01.943
Deepak Chopra, they all talk about this for

496
00:17:01.943 --> 00:17:03.364
thousands--

497
00:17:03.364 --> 00:17:04.963
well, not Deepak for thousands but well, maybe

498
00:17:04.963 --> 00:17:06.243
if you count past lives--

499
00:17:06.243 --> 00:17:07.064
(laughing)

500
00:17:07.064 --> 00:17:10.423
but this is not new news to spiritual teachers.

501
00:17:10.423 --> 00:17:11.984
They've always said this.

502
00:17:11.984 --> 00:17:14.743
<v Regina>Yet the average person that</v>

503
00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:17.023
has yet to master it.

504
00:17:17.023 --> 00:17:18.804
Bottom line, most people on the planet

505
00:17:18.804 --> 00:17:19.984
have not mastered it yet.

506
00:17:19.984 --> 00:17:21.063
I understand what you're saying.

507
00:17:21.063 --> 00:17:23.243
By using the word love in that frequency

508
00:17:23.243 --> 00:17:24.904
and sticking with it with your work,

509
00:17:24.904 --> 00:17:27.143
that's a nice answer to that question.

510
00:17:27.143 --> 00:17:30.064
Let's now go into come of the mechanics

511
00:17:30.064 --> 00:17:32.863
when you don't have this in place.

512
00:17:32.863 --> 00:17:34.944
When you haven't gone through the process

513
00:17:34.944 --> 00:17:36.384
of really knowing yourself,

514
00:17:36.384 --> 00:17:38.023
knowing your values,

515
00:17:38.023 --> 00:17:40.024
knowing what's important to you,

516
00:17:40.024 --> 00:17:43.684
is that we miss the mark in not insisting

517
00:17:43.684 --> 00:17:47.604
on going for our dream.

518
00:17:47.604 --> 00:17:50.984
I know very few women who are living their dream.

519
00:17:50.984 --> 00:17:52.784
Very, very few.

520
00:17:52.784 --> 00:17:54.543
This is written more for women which is

521
00:17:54.543 --> 00:17:56.384
why I keep saying women although it's

522
00:17:56.384 --> 00:17:58.623
applicable to men absolutely.

523
00:17:58.623 --> 00:18:01.263
<v ->Oh, it's very applicable to men.</v>

524
00:18:01.263 --> 00:18:02.584
It's just different societal handcuffs that

525
00:18:02.584 --> 00:18:03.223
are on the men.

526
00:18:03.223 --> 00:18:04.024
There's many men walking around right now

527
00:18:04.024 --> 00:18:06.223
who feel like they can't leave their jobs

528
00:18:06.223 --> 00:18:07.484
to go after what they want.

529
00:18:07.484 --> 00:18:09.083
<v Regina>I know very few men living their dream.</v>

530
00:18:09.083 --> 00:18:13.984
<v ->It's both ways and a big part is that we don't stop,</v>

531
00:18:13.984 --> 00:18:17.863
in this culture, to contemplate what our dream are.

532
00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:20.624
So, our culture, the Western culture,

533
00:18:20.624 --> 00:18:22.744
is very achievement based.

534
00:18:22.744 --> 00:18:24.563
It's all based on what you do,

535
00:18:24.563 --> 00:18:26.144
what you have.

536
00:18:26.144 --> 00:18:28.024
That is the way that we define success

537
00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:30.163
in our culture, and even those of us who

538
00:18:30.163 --> 00:18:32.484
are more enlightened and on more of a spiritual path.

539
00:18:32.484 --> 00:18:34.423
I've been on a spiritual path for ten years and

540
00:18:34.423 --> 00:18:36.923
I have to tell you, I've done some major deprogramming

541
00:18:36.923 --> 00:18:40.623
to get down to the core value of my self-worth.

542
00:18:40.623 --> 00:18:42.524
Where does my self-worth come from?

543
00:18:42.524 --> 00:18:44.603
Now, self-worth--

544
00:18:44.603 --> 00:18:46.844
I think of self-love as a tree.

545
00:18:46.844 --> 00:18:48.883
Self-love has all these branches.

546
00:18:48.883 --> 00:18:50.444
There's self-acceptance,

547
00:18:50.444 --> 00:18:52.244
self-honesty, self-confidence, self-esteem

548
00:18:52.244 --> 00:18:53.703
and all the branches need to grow and

549
00:18:53.703 --> 00:18:55.924
grow equally, or your tree will fall over, right?

550
00:18:55.924 --> 00:18:58.564
So, if you have high self-esteem and

551
00:18:58.564 --> 00:18:59.384
low self-compassion?

552
00:18:59.384 --> 00:19:01.463
High achiever, super mean to yourself, right?

553
00:19:01.463 --> 00:19:03.124
So, you have this tree.

554
00:19:03.124 --> 00:19:06.004
The roots are your self-worth and you have to

555
00:19:06.004 --> 00:19:09.403
fundamentally believe that you are worthy

556
00:19:09.403 --> 00:19:12.064
no matter what's going on out there,

557
00:19:12.064 --> 00:19:14.224
which is really hard because every single image--

558
00:19:14.224 --> 00:19:15.364
not every single--

559
00:19:15.364 --> 00:19:18.863
thank you for creating conscious, lovely positive media.

560
00:19:18.863 --> 00:19:20.983
People like you are shifting the consciousness.

561
00:19:20.983 --> 00:19:25.924
But, we see images every day and 92% of all images

562
00:19:25.924 --> 00:19:29.263
go into our actual subconscious, not our consciousness.

563
00:19:29.263 --> 00:19:31.164
So, even us enlightened people, right?

564
00:19:31.164 --> 00:19:32.804
We have to be really conscious about what

565
00:19:32.804 --> 00:19:34.204
we are inputting in.

566
00:19:34.204 --> 00:19:36.145
93% of those are telling you that

567
00:19:36.145 --> 00:19:37.243
you're not enough.

568
00:19:37.243 --> 00:19:37.944
Everything.

569
00:19:37.944 --> 00:19:39.244
You don't have enough, you're not enough.

570
00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:40.164
You're not this.

571
00:19:40.164 --> 00:19:42.283
So, we literally have to be reprogramming ourselves

572
00:19:42.283 --> 00:19:44.484
to say "I am enough."

573
00:19:44.484 --> 00:19:45.864
<v Regina>And with repetition.</v>

574
00:19:45.864 --> 00:19:47.443
<v ->Over and over.</v>

575
00:19:47.443 --> 00:19:48.784
I call them Love Mantras.

576
00:19:48.784 --> 00:19:51.284
One Love Mantra that I love,

577
00:19:51.284 --> 00:19:52.604
that I do every morning,

578
00:19:52.604 --> 00:19:54.124
it's called the Self-Love Soak.

579
00:19:54.124 --> 00:19:55.684
I close my eyes.

580
00:19:55.684 --> 00:19:57.324
I'm like, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.

581
00:19:57.324 --> 00:19:58.903
I wake up, open my eyes, close my eyes

582
00:19:58.903 --> 00:20:00.343
and just say to myself,

583
00:20:00.343 --> 00:20:02.923
"Christine, I love you."

584
00:20:02.923 --> 00:20:05.204
And I'll say it over and over again.

585
00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:06.284
"Christine, I love you, Christine, I love you."

586
00:20:06.284 --> 00:20:09.824
Until I can feel the love soak into myself,

587
00:20:09.824 --> 00:20:11.244
I will not get out of bed.

588
00:20:11.244 --> 00:20:11.924
<v Regina>Very good.</v>

589
00:20:11.924 --> 00:20:13.204
And a lot of people will say, you know,

590
00:20:13.204 --> 00:20:14.563
Stuart Smalley, Saturday Night Live.

591
00:20:14.563 --> 00:20:16.063
Affirmations and all that,

592
00:20:16.063 --> 00:20:18.663
but the reality you just touched on there

593
00:20:18.663 --> 00:20:22.323
is that we are being programmed every day

594
00:20:22.323 --> 00:20:24.923
with negative data and,

595
00:20:24.923 --> 00:20:26.564
if you look at it that way,

596
00:20:26.564 --> 00:20:28.784
the subconscious mind is, in a sense,

597
00:20:28.784 --> 00:20:30.983
at least a portion of it, is a program.

598
00:20:30.983 --> 00:20:33.663
So, we program it with this garbage

599
00:20:33.663 --> 00:20:35.964
and then we do virtually nothing to

600
00:20:35.964 --> 00:20:37.943
counterbalance that negative programming.

601
00:20:37.943 --> 00:20:39.684
It seems that a lot of what

602
00:20:39.684 --> 00:20:41.423
you are talking about in this book,

603
00:20:41.423 --> 00:20:46.004
first of all, it's very much needed self-evaluation.

604
00:20:46.004 --> 00:20:48.884
Honest, brutally honest, in a kind way,

605
00:20:48.884 --> 00:20:53.524
self-evaluation but bolstered with this repetition

606
00:20:53.524 --> 00:20:57.164
of message to self, and it makes total sense.

607
00:20:57.164 --> 00:20:59.424
It's not a Saturday Night Live skit.

608
00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:01.143
<v ->No, it's not.</v>

609
00:21:01.143 --> 00:21:02.743
I always like to say you are your own best friend.

610
00:21:02.743 --> 00:21:04.304
You talk to your best friend all the time.

611
00:21:04.304 --> 00:21:05.924
Why wouldn't you talk to yourself, you know?

612
00:21:05.924 --> 00:21:10.884
There's also the way I like to think about why,

613
00:21:10.884 --> 00:21:14.303
when your thoughts that are running through here,

614
00:21:14.303 --> 00:21:16.724
create a vibration that create an emotional field

615
00:21:16.724 --> 00:21:17.923
inside of your body.

616
00:21:17.923 --> 00:21:20.064
The words you speak are also a vibration.

617
00:21:20.064 --> 00:21:20.764
<v Regina>You bet.</v>

618
00:21:20.764 --> 00:21:21.903
<v ->Sound is vibration, right?</v>

619
00:21:21.903 --> 00:21:23.884
So, there's all kinds of studies that have been done,

620
00:21:23.884 --> 00:21:25.403
including messages in water and how they--

621
00:21:25.403 --> 00:21:30.244
there's so many studies so it's not just theoretical,

622
00:21:30.244 --> 00:21:34.023
it really is scientifically proven.

623
00:21:34.023 --> 00:21:36.164
So, just think about how you start your day

624
00:21:36.164 --> 00:21:37.143
is how you live it.

625
00:21:37.143 --> 00:21:38.424
It's like one simple thing you can do.

626
00:21:38.424 --> 00:21:40.204
How you start your day is how you live your day.

627
00:21:40.204 --> 00:21:42.864
So, if you start your day in love and loving yourself,

628
00:21:42.864 --> 00:21:45.264
you're much more likely to be able to anchor into that

629
00:21:45.264 --> 00:21:47.744
when you go out in that crazy fear-based world

630
00:21:47.744 --> 00:21:49.504
to get back to love.

631
00:21:49.504 --> 00:21:51.344
So, that's why I do that every morning.

632
00:21:51.344 --> 00:21:52.624
<v Regina>I think it's a beautiful exercise and</v>

633
00:21:52.624 --> 00:21:57.004
it has to be there's a point at which it's almost absurd

634
00:21:57.004 --> 00:21:58.924
and you start laughing.

635
00:21:58.924 --> 00:21:59.864
<v ->Oh, yeah.</v>

636
00:21:59.864 --> 00:22:00.864
And then people say,

637
00:22:00.864 --> 00:22:02.824
"I don't feel it. I'm not feeling it."

638
00:22:02.824 --> 00:22:04.803
Fake it til you make it, baby.

639
00:22:04.803 --> 00:22:06.204
Just fake it til you make it,

640
00:22:06.204 --> 00:22:07.424
because that's the thing.

641
00:22:07.424 --> 00:22:08.803
Self-love is a daring act.

642
00:22:08.803 --> 00:22:11.804
You'd better believe that's daring in our culture.

643
00:22:11.804 --> 00:22:15.283
If you look up "self-love" on dictionary.com,

644
00:22:15.283 --> 00:22:19.144
the current definition is "conceit, vanity and narcissim."

645
00:22:19.144 --> 00:22:21.343
<v Regina>Well that's the current perception of self-love.</v>

646
00:22:21.343 --> 00:22:23.703
<v ->We have to change.</v>

647
00:22:23.703 --> 00:22:25.104
<v Regina>Absolutely.</v>

648
00:22:25.104 --> 00:22:25.844
And you're right.

649
00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:28.663
These are words that are heavily loaded

650
00:22:28.663 --> 00:22:31.223
in a wonderful way with frequencies and

651
00:22:31.223 --> 00:22:33.343
these frequencies are the counterbalance

652
00:22:33.343 --> 00:22:35.103
to the fearful frequencies like we just talked

653
00:22:35.103 --> 00:22:36.023
about a moment ago.

654
00:22:36.023 --> 00:22:39.284
I just really wanted to put a yellow highlight

655
00:22:39.284 --> 00:22:42.723
on this because I think it's a very important point.

656
00:22:42.723 --> 00:22:45.583
Let's get into, you talk about relationships

657
00:22:45.583 --> 00:22:46.943
in this a fair amount,

658
00:22:46.943 --> 00:22:49.064
because oftentimes people will tend to

659
00:22:49.064 --> 00:22:51.924
give themselves away in favor of having a "We."

660
00:22:51.924 --> 00:22:55.104
They'll put the "Me" aside.

661
00:22:55.104 --> 00:23:00.104
You were talking about filling holes in the relationship.

662
00:23:00.384 --> 00:23:02.884
We tend to choose people who will fill holes.

663
00:23:02.884 --> 00:23:03.804
But on the other hand,

664
00:23:03.804 --> 00:23:05.983
you talk about like attracts like.

665
00:23:05.983 --> 00:23:09.463
So, in a moment, if you just look at it quickly,

666
00:23:09.463 --> 00:23:11.904
it would almost seem like a contradiction

667
00:23:11.904 --> 00:23:13.164
but explain what you mean there.

668
00:23:13.164 --> 00:23:14.464
<v ->Well, the way that I look at the equation is</v>

669
00:23:14.464 --> 00:23:18.644
Healthy Me plus Healthy He or She equals a Healthy We.

670
00:23:18.644 --> 00:23:21.223
And if you're unhealthy, or you are holey--

671
00:23:21.223 --> 00:23:22.883
and I don't mean "wholly" like w-h-o-,

672
00:23:22.883 --> 00:23:24.463
I mean holey like full of holes--

673
00:23:24.463 --> 00:23:26.704
kind of like Swiss cheese because you haven't done

674
00:23:26.704 --> 00:23:30.783
your own healing work what we do is we put those people

675
00:23:30.783 --> 00:23:33.944
into those holes, which is why you end up dating

676
00:23:33.944 --> 00:23:36.104
the same person again and again.

677
00:23:36.104 --> 00:23:39.304
Or you keep marrying the same person again and again.

678
00:23:39.304 --> 00:23:41.544
So, for me, what happened to me ten years ago

679
00:23:41.544 --> 00:23:43.243
when I had that break, I said

680
00:23:43.243 --> 00:23:45.884
"Okay, I can keep doing what I've been doing,

681
00:23:45.884 --> 00:23:49.224
"or I can stop and really look at myself."

682
00:23:49.224 --> 00:23:51.424
And that's when I took the second,

683
00:23:51.424 --> 00:23:52.723
really the third, vow of

684
00:23:52.723 --> 00:23:55.564
"I will be honest with myself no matter what."

685
00:23:55.564 --> 00:23:56.924
And, I have to tell you,

686
00:23:56.924 --> 00:24:00.144
that was one of the hardest vows I ever had to stick to

687
00:24:00.144 --> 00:24:02.964
and it's the vow again and again when people come to me

688
00:24:02.964 --> 00:24:05.264
and say they're not happy in the relationship and

689
00:24:05.264 --> 00:24:06.864
I ask them if they are absolutely being

690
00:24:06.864 --> 00:24:08.903
100% honest with themselves,

691
00:24:08.903 --> 00:24:11.264
they never say "yes."

692
00:24:11.264 --> 00:24:12.064
<v Regina>That's right.</v>

693
00:24:12.064 --> 00:24:13.063
Because, it's almost as if,

694
00:24:13.063 --> 00:24:14.584
when you name it,

695
00:24:14.584 --> 00:24:19.584
that you now are irretrievably lost

696
00:24:19.984 --> 00:24:24.264
or the relationship you're in is irretrievably over

697
00:24:24.264 --> 00:24:25.944
if you name it and that's not necessarily so,

698
00:24:25.944 --> 00:24:29.083
but the fear is loss.

699
00:24:29.083 --> 00:24:29.984
<v ->The fear is--</v>

700
00:24:29.984 --> 00:24:31.624
<v Regina>If you look at the dark side.</v>

701
00:24:31.624 --> 00:24:33.484
<v ->The fear is, and it's not even the truth</v>

702
00:24:33.484 --> 00:24:34.543
that we're afraid of,

703
00:24:34.543 --> 00:24:36.744
it's the consequences of admitting the truth, right?

704
00:24:36.744 --> 00:24:40.245
And especially as a people who we think are enlightened

705
00:24:40.245 --> 00:24:42.303
or we're this or we're strong,

706
00:24:42.303 --> 00:24:45.604
if you have to admit that you have that fear

707
00:24:45.604 --> 00:24:47.044
then there's all these other judgements.

708
00:24:47.044 --> 00:24:48.804
I should be stronger.

709
00:24:48.804 --> 00:24:49.424
I should know better.

710
00:24:49.424 --> 00:24:51.444
I should be more spiritually enlightened than this.

711
00:24:51.444 --> 00:24:53.225
Who says?

712
00:24:53.225 --> 00:24:54.764
You know?

713
00:24:54.764 --> 00:24:55.364
Who says?

714
00:24:55.364 --> 00:24:56.244
It takes a strong person to

715
00:24:56.244 --> 00:24:57.264
look fear in the face and say,

716
00:24:57.264 --> 00:24:59.664
"I see you and I'm going to walk through you anyway,

717
00:24:59.664 --> 00:25:01.963
"because I know love is stronger than you."

718
00:25:01.963 --> 00:25:03.524
And that's what we're up to right now.

719
00:25:03.524 --> 00:25:04.644
Make no mistake.

720
00:25:04.644 --> 00:25:07.144
That's what we're up to as individual souls.

721
00:25:07.144 --> 00:25:10.284
We are in a transition of removing fear

722
00:25:10.284 --> 00:25:12.839
in every place in our life and having to choose love

723
00:25:12.839 --> 00:25:15.798
again and again and again and again.

724
00:25:15.798 --> 00:25:18.639
That's my practice.

725
00:25:18.639 --> 00:25:20.820
I'm still on this journey.

726
00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.799
I don't have it all figured out and

727
00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:24.680
I wouldn't listen to anyone who told me

728
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.479
that they had it all figured out.

729
00:25:26.479 --> 00:25:28.279
This is not the Age of the Guru.

730
00:25:28.279 --> 00:25:30.018
This is the Age of Let's All Share.

731
00:25:30.018 --> 00:25:32.499
Let's raise our vibrations and connect together,

732
00:25:32.499 --> 00:25:34.059
because that's what it's going to take

733
00:25:34.059 --> 00:25:38.099
for us all to live whether we want our lives full of love.

734
00:25:38.099 --> 00:25:39.899
It's the great human equalizer.

735
00:25:39.899 --> 00:25:40.939
<v Regina>Yes, and yet we feel that</v>

736
00:25:40.939 --> 00:25:42.559
we'll crumble if we look at the truth.

737
00:25:42.559 --> 00:25:43.999
What have you seen?

738
00:25:43.999 --> 00:25:46.479
Just give me your own example,

739
00:25:46.479 --> 00:25:48.659
because we're speaking about your journey now.

740
00:25:48.659 --> 00:25:50.679
When you had to really look at the truth

741
00:25:50.679 --> 00:25:53.119
after this 15 year kind of charade

742
00:25:53.119 --> 00:25:54.420
you were doing in this relationship,

743
00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.639
which a lot of people can relate to because

744
00:25:56.639 --> 00:25:58.099
they may have done 30 years of charade.

745
00:25:58.099 --> 00:26:00.818
You know, just kind of coping, surviving.

746
00:26:00.818 --> 00:26:03.839
What did you find in there,

747
00:26:03.839 --> 00:26:06.938
when you looked at the--

748
00:26:06.938 --> 00:26:08.719
when you did the really deep appraisal?

749
00:26:08.719 --> 00:26:13.719
<v ->I found a girl who was desperately afraid to be alone.</v>

750
00:26:14.899 --> 00:26:19.899
Could not be alone and so sold her soul,

751
00:26:20.459 --> 00:26:22.479
was willing really,

752
00:26:22.479 --> 00:26:24.218
to sell her soul to give it up,

753
00:26:24.218 --> 00:26:26.958
to trade the journey that my soul came here to have

754
00:26:26.958 --> 00:26:29.919
in order to recieve love,

755
00:26:29.919 --> 00:26:31.919
which wasn't even unconditional love.

756
00:26:31.919 --> 00:26:33.479
I was receiving conditional love.

757
00:26:33.479 --> 00:26:35.479
For any of those people that are watching right now

758
00:26:35.479 --> 00:26:37.418
that have received conditional love,

759
00:26:37.418 --> 00:26:39.838
you know what a painful experience that is.

760
00:26:39.838 --> 00:26:41.699
I don't know that there's much more

761
00:26:41.699 --> 00:26:43.218
of a painful experience than for someone to give love

762
00:26:43.218 --> 00:26:44.719
and then take it back.

763
00:26:44.719 --> 00:26:46.140
Give love and take it back.

764
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.619
It's this constant--

765
00:26:47.619 --> 00:26:50.019
it's like constant dental work, you know?

766
00:26:50.019 --> 00:26:51.239
(laughing)

767
00:26:51.239 --> 00:26:52.679
<v Regina>Without anesthetic.</v>

768
00:26:52.679 --> 00:26:53.458
<v ->Exactly.</v>

769
00:26:53.458 --> 00:26:54.119
That painful.

770
00:26:54.119 --> 00:26:56.319
And that was the emotionally abusive

771
00:26:56.319 --> 00:26:58.319
relationship I was in.

772
00:26:58.319 --> 00:27:00.678
That was the contract we have made with each other.

773
00:27:00.678 --> 00:27:02.699
And so, to look at myself and be like,

774
00:27:02.699 --> 00:27:06.619
"Wow, look what I did to myself."

775
00:27:06.619 --> 00:27:08.299
That was the hardest thing.

776
00:27:08.299 --> 00:27:12.058
I forgave him eight, nine months into the dissolution

777
00:27:12.058 --> 00:27:15.519
of our relationship, of our house and all that.

778
00:27:15.519 --> 00:27:18.999
It took me five years to forgive myself.

779
00:27:18.999 --> 00:27:20.198
<v Regina>Really?</v>

780
00:27:20.198 --> 00:27:22.079
And what was that?

781
00:27:22.079 --> 00:27:25.159
What was the thing you were holding on to there?

782
00:27:25.159 --> 00:27:30.159
<v ->I had to admit that I settled for my little dreams</v>

783
00:27:30.619 --> 00:27:33.899
and sold out my big dreams and sold out

784
00:27:33.899 --> 00:27:35.518
what I really wanted.

785
00:27:35.518 --> 00:27:37.240
I knew from the age of fourteen,

786
00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.939
the first time I ever came to California,

787
00:27:38.939 --> 00:27:40.519
that I wanted to live in California.

788
00:27:40.519 --> 00:27:42.019
I knew from when I was seven,

789
00:27:42.019 --> 00:27:44.139
I wanted to be a fashion designer.

790
00:27:44.139 --> 00:27:47.719
I gave up both of those dreams for him

791
00:27:47.719 --> 00:27:49.559
and also for my friends,

792
00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:52.018
because I was afraid to be alone.

793
00:27:52.018 --> 00:27:53.438
You could look at that and say,

794
00:27:53.438 --> 00:27:54.598
well, your father died.

795
00:27:54.598 --> 00:27:56.519
Of course, that's part of it.

796
00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:58.739
But it goes way back before that even happened.

797
00:27:58.739 --> 00:28:01.239
It goes back to my initial love crack,

798
00:28:01.239 --> 00:28:04.999
which came from being given to a mother

799
00:28:04.999 --> 00:28:07.399
whose heart was so closed that she didn't

800
00:28:07.399 --> 00:28:10.478
have the capacity to receive me.

801
00:28:10.478 --> 00:28:11.679
<v Regina>So, you chose these parents</v>

802
00:28:11.679 --> 00:28:13.759
so that you could develop this part of yourself

803
00:28:13.759 --> 00:28:15.659
and tell this story today.

804
00:28:15.659 --> 00:28:16.879
Which is beautiful.

805
00:28:16.879 --> 00:28:19.019
And just to claim yourself early on

806
00:28:19.019 --> 00:28:20.419
when you changed your name.

807
00:28:20.419 --> 00:28:22.539
You didn't identify with either one of those.

808
00:28:22.539 --> 00:28:25.359
<v ->No, and the truth is the Spirit tried to wake me up</v>

809
00:28:25.359 --> 00:28:28.078
at age 18, tried to wake me up again at 26.

810
00:28:28.078 --> 00:28:29.599
I had moments, you know?

811
00:28:29.599 --> 00:28:31.179
It wasn't until 30,

812
00:28:31.179 --> 00:28:33.118
Saturn came back around and out it went.

813
00:28:33.118 --> 00:28:34.419
(laughing)

814
00:28:34.419 --> 00:28:35.838
So, I'm very grateful.

815
00:28:35.838 --> 00:28:37.559
<v Regina>Saturn return is a good taskmaster.</v>

816
00:28:37.559 --> 00:28:38.379
<v ->Saturn return, yes.</v>

817
00:28:38.379 --> 00:28:39.599
It's a good taskmaster.

818
00:28:39.599 --> 00:28:43.400
So now, I can really look back at my former person

819
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.059
and I haven't spoken to him since.

820
00:28:45.059 --> 00:28:46.898
He called a year later, actually,

821
00:28:46.898 --> 00:28:48.579
and asked me back.

822
00:28:48.579 --> 00:28:49.558
And I remember the day.

823
00:28:49.558 --> 00:28:50.999
I was sitting on my couch in Chicago,

824
00:28:50.999 --> 00:28:53.119
phone rings and he asks me to come back

825
00:28:53.119 --> 00:28:56.659
and I remember I was dating my current husband at the time

826
00:28:56.659 --> 00:28:58.459
and I remember looking over at Noah and

827
00:28:58.459 --> 00:29:00.858
I didn't, he was no part of my answer.

828
00:29:00.858 --> 00:29:02.799
This had nothing to do with him.

829
00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:04.659
I just checked in with myself and I said to him,

830
00:29:04.659 --> 00:29:08.418
"No. Thank you for calling but no.

831
00:29:08.418 --> 00:29:10.779
"I really have to choose myself."

832
00:29:10.779 --> 00:29:12.279
And it was like, in that moment,

833
00:29:12.279 --> 00:29:15.899
self-love gates just started--

834
00:29:15.899 --> 00:29:19.199
and it was the first time in our relationship

835
00:29:19.199 --> 00:29:21.619
that I had chosen myself over him.

836
00:29:21.619 --> 00:29:23.058
The love that I wanted.

837
00:29:23.058 --> 00:29:24.779
Because I knew that it came from me.

838
00:29:24.779 --> 00:29:26.899
I'd given away my love power.

839
00:29:26.899 --> 00:29:27.978
I gave away my power to feel love

840
00:29:27.978 --> 00:29:31.939
to another human being.

841
00:29:31.939 --> 00:29:32.999
That's just--

842
00:29:32.999 --> 00:29:35.399
that's self-torture.

843
00:29:35.399 --> 00:29:37.959
That's crazy.

844
00:29:37.959 --> 00:29:40.738
But, it's because as a little girl.

845
00:29:40.738 --> 00:29:44.258
I lost that thread of love and that really is my mission.

846
00:29:44.258 --> 00:29:47.959
If I can leave this planet where we live in a world

847
00:29:47.959 --> 00:29:50.759
where every girl and boy is born in love with themselves

848
00:29:50.759 --> 00:29:52.578
and stays in love with themselves and

849
00:29:52.578 --> 00:29:56.119
that thread of love stays with them,

850
00:29:56.119 --> 00:29:58.758
then my job is done.

851
00:29:58.758 --> 00:30:02.019
<v Regina>If you've done it for a dozen people</v>

852
00:30:02.019 --> 00:30:03.499
that's a huge feat.

853
00:30:03.499 --> 00:30:04.679
But you are doing it for many more than that.

854
00:30:04.679 --> 00:30:05.499
You are helping many more people find

855
00:30:05.499 --> 00:30:07.119
that in themselves.

856
00:30:07.119 --> 00:30:09.459
Going back to the relationship, okay?

857
00:30:09.459 --> 00:30:11.259
<v ->Yeah.</v>

858
00:30:11.259 --> 00:30:12.419
<v Regina>So, in the book, you talk about how</v>

859
00:30:12.419 --> 00:30:13.859
you have this one area where you say

860
00:30:13.859 --> 00:30:15.779
this little meditation.

861
00:30:15.779 --> 00:30:17.079
What's this feel like?

862
00:30:17.079 --> 00:30:21.199
And women who have had romantic notions in the past

863
00:30:21.199 --> 00:30:23.359
and most women have had romantic notions.

864
00:30:23.359 --> 00:30:24.459
<v ->We all have.</v>

865
00:30:24.459 --> 00:30:25.839
<v Regina>Just stuff in the movies and</v>

866
00:30:25.839 --> 00:30:29.639
we'll watch the hero and the heroine and

867
00:30:29.639 --> 00:30:32.559
the man will look her in the eyes and say

868
00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:35.118
"I love you, you're the only person I want"

869
00:30:35.118 --> 00:30:36.459
and blah blah blah.

870
00:30:36.459 --> 00:30:38.679
It's interesting how you have people look at it,

871
00:30:38.679 --> 00:30:40.399
which I find very true.

872
00:30:40.399 --> 00:30:41.838
How's that make you feel

873
00:30:41.838 --> 00:30:43.399
when you're imagining it for yourself?

874
00:30:43.399 --> 00:30:44.718
Talk about that a little bit.

875
00:30:44.718 --> 00:30:47.139
Because this is supposedly an ideal that

876
00:30:47.139 --> 00:30:50.239
people have looked for throughout the ages.

877
00:30:50.239 --> 00:30:52.379
<v ->I'm sure that's why The Bachelor and</v>

878
00:30:52.379 --> 00:30:54.779
The Bachelorette continue to do well in the ratings,

879
00:30:54.779 --> 00:30:56.439
because I don't understand it.

880
00:30:56.439 --> 00:30:58.438
But think of it this way.

881
00:30:58.438 --> 00:31:01.919
We all want to be loved, we all want to be seen.

882
00:31:01.919 --> 00:31:03.438
That's what we really want.

883
00:31:03.438 --> 00:31:05.299
We get that confused with this romantic hoopla

884
00:31:05.299 --> 00:31:08.959
business where it's almost energetically,

885
00:31:08.959 --> 00:31:12.579
I'm going to pretend that you're my gal, here

886
00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:13.998
and I'm just going to be like,

887
00:31:13.998 --> 00:31:15.979
"Oh, I love you so much.

888
00:31:15.979 --> 00:31:18.119
"I'm so happy you're in my life.

889
00:31:18.119 --> 00:31:20.299
"Thank you, thank you, thank you."

890
00:31:20.299 --> 00:31:22.139
And it's almost like feeling like

891
00:31:22.139 --> 00:31:25.359
I'm a blanket that's just goo-ing on you.

892
00:31:25.359 --> 00:31:26.859
There's this energy of romance that

893
00:31:26.859 --> 00:31:30.120
can be very gooey and that's that ideal

894
00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.619
that we see in the movies.

895
00:31:31.619 --> 00:31:33.379
There's the flowers and there's the fireplace

896
00:31:33.379 --> 00:31:35.619
and romance is important.

897
00:31:35.619 --> 00:31:38.199
My husband buys me flowers often

898
00:31:38.199 --> 00:31:39.619
and we dance in our living room and

899
00:31:39.619 --> 00:31:42.559
all of that but there's an energy that,

900
00:31:42.559 --> 00:31:44.479
when you see it on the screen,

901
00:31:44.479 --> 00:31:46.719
you can almost feel the people stuffing

902
00:31:46.719 --> 00:31:48.599
each other into their holes.

903
00:31:48.599 --> 00:31:50.098
It's called co-dependency.

904
00:31:50.098 --> 00:31:51.539
You don't want that.

905
00:31:51.539 --> 00:31:53.719
What we want is interdependency.

906
00:31:53.719 --> 00:31:55.320
So, if we're in a relationship and

907
00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.259
it's more like,

908
00:31:59.259 --> 00:32:02.759
"You're really beautiful.

909
00:32:02.759 --> 00:32:07.759
"Wow. Thank you for being here on this planet.

910
00:32:09.938 --> 00:32:13.439
"Thank you for being here in my life right now."

911
00:32:13.439 --> 00:32:15.578
<v Regina>That feels much cleaner.</v>

912
00:32:15.578 --> 00:32:16.679
<v ->Yeah.</v>

913
00:32:16.679 --> 00:32:19.338
<v Regina>You don't feel the entrapment</v>

914
00:32:19.338 --> 00:32:21.860
and the need in that statement

915
00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.119
versus the previous one.

916
00:32:23.119 --> 00:32:25.139
I think that was a really beautiful meditation

917
00:32:25.139 --> 00:32:26.198
you put in there,

918
00:32:26.198 --> 00:32:28.119
because people when you look at it,

919
00:32:28.119 --> 00:32:31.579
and yet, it's still externalized as an ideal.

920
00:32:31.579 --> 00:32:34.139
<v ->And what I just did, just for transparency,</v>

921
00:32:34.139 --> 00:32:36.639
is that I just opened myself up,

922
00:32:36.639 --> 00:32:37.979
I dropped my shield,

923
00:32:37.979 --> 00:32:39.479
I got very vulnerable.

924
00:32:39.479 --> 00:32:41.859
<v Regina>Yes. Yes.</v>

925
00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:43.559
<v ->I looked at you and you let me in to see you.</v>

926
00:32:43.559 --> 00:32:46.099
Now, this is what I get into later in the book.

927
00:32:46.099 --> 00:32:48.639
Because it was, how is it that we don't get--

928
00:32:48.639 --> 00:32:50.439
all these women out there and men, too,

929
00:32:50.439 --> 00:32:52.159
that want these great relationships,

930
00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:54.740
that want to have this vulnerable, intimate relationship,

931
00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.359
why do we not have that?

932
00:32:57.359 --> 00:32:59.239
And where I had to get really honest with myself about,

933
00:32:59.239 --> 00:33:01.059
when I started dating Walking Love,

934
00:33:01.059 --> 00:33:02.079
which is what I call Noah,

935
00:33:02.079 --> 00:33:04.779
because he's like the biggest open heart ever.

936
00:33:04.779 --> 00:33:06.299
He just loves.

937
00:33:06.299 --> 00:33:06.939
He's open.

938
00:33:06.939 --> 00:33:08.359
And my heart was like,

939
00:33:08.359 --> 00:33:09.459
Fort Knox around it and my love quotient

940
00:33:09.459 --> 00:33:12.639
was the size of a pea and so

941
00:33:12.639 --> 00:33:16.299
he's really shown me what it means to let love in.

942
00:33:16.299 --> 00:33:19.840
That's when I realized that I was not comfortable

943
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:24.699
with intimacy, I didn't even know what intimacy is.

944
00:33:24.699 --> 00:33:27.599
The definition of intimacy is all messed up, too.

945
00:33:27.599 --> 00:33:29.599
The way that we define it in our culture

946
00:33:29.599 --> 00:33:32.559
is intimacy is sex, that they are the same thing.

947
00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:34.120
And they are not the same thing.

948
00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.059
In fact, you can be intimate

949
00:33:35.059 --> 00:33:36.139
without taking your clothes off.

950
00:33:36.139 --> 00:33:38.359
We just had an intimate moment.

951
00:33:38.359 --> 00:33:41.479
So, it's our uncomfortability with intimacy

952
00:33:41.479 --> 00:33:43.060
which really, the definition of,

953
00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:44.659
the best way ever described to me is

954
00:33:44.659 --> 00:33:46.959
"in to me see."

955
00:33:46.959 --> 00:33:50.479
When I really got clear that what I wanted in a partner

956
00:33:50.479 --> 00:33:53.079
was someone who could really see me,

957
00:33:53.079 --> 00:33:55.999
that's when I attracted Noah into my life,

958
00:33:55.999 --> 00:33:57.739
and he was the first person,

959
00:33:57.739 --> 00:33:59.138
other than myself,

960
00:33:59.138 --> 00:34:00.579
to really see me.

961
00:34:00.579 --> 00:34:04.479
But only because I finally saw me.

962
00:34:04.479 --> 00:34:06.979
<v Regina>Yeah, and so the resonance was there.</v>

963
00:34:06.979 --> 00:34:08.940
One of the things you also talk about,

964
00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.560
prior to getting to that point is

965
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.719
alot of people are really vested in being

966
00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:16.358
the martyr and victim in their relationships

967
00:34:16.358 --> 00:34:19.299
and in their lives with everybody.

968
00:34:19.299 --> 00:34:21.399
This has to stop.

969
00:34:21.399 --> 00:34:24.239
<v ->I was there myself.</v>

970
00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:26.979
It was really easy for me to blame my former person.

971
00:34:26.979 --> 00:34:30.319
"You are such a jerk, you broke up with me on

972
00:34:30.319 --> 00:34:31.839
"the way to our engagement party,

973
00:34:31.839 --> 00:34:34.098
"you were mean to me, you never showed up for me."

974
00:34:34.098 --> 00:34:37.819
All the things he didn't do and I could count on my hands

975
00:34:37.819 --> 00:34:39.698
and toes and if I had more digits.

976
00:34:39.698 --> 00:34:42.059
All the conversations I've had with girlfriends

977
00:34:42.059 --> 00:34:43.719
about their boyfriends.

978
00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:45.019
It just happened four days ago with a friend

979
00:34:45.019 --> 00:34:47.019
who is complaining about her ex-husband

980
00:34:47.019 --> 00:34:50.060
who has acted the same way for the last ten years.

981
00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.219
He's never shown up.

982
00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:52.559
No surprise, right?

983
00:34:52.559 --> 00:34:55.039
So, I remember I picked up,

984
00:34:55.039 --> 00:34:56.779
this was eight months into my awakening,

985
00:34:56.779 --> 00:34:58.619
I picked up a book by Anthony de Mello,

986
00:34:58.619 --> 00:34:59.719
who wrote a book called

987
00:34:59.719 --> 00:35:00.719
"The Way to Love."

988
00:35:00.719 --> 00:35:01.839
It's one of the best books.

989
00:35:01.839 --> 00:35:02.478
Little book.

990
00:35:02.478 --> 00:35:03.819
If you don't have it, it's such a good book.

991
00:35:03.819 --> 00:35:05.499
He wrote another book called "The Whereness."

992
00:35:05.499 --> 00:35:07.999
I've never read the whole book except for this one time.

993
00:35:07.999 --> 00:35:10.859
I pick it up and I open it and there's a paragraph.

994
00:35:10.859 --> 00:35:12.839
It says,

995
00:35:12.839 --> 00:35:16.999
"You cannot be angry with someone for how they treated you,

996
00:35:16.999 --> 00:35:18.899
"because they were only treating you exactly how

997
00:35:18.899 --> 00:35:20.600
"they've always treated you."

998
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.038
It's your own fault, basically, for thinking that they

999
00:35:23.038 --> 00:35:25.880
were someone other than who they are.

1000
00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.278
In that moment, it was like the angels sang

1001
00:35:28.278 --> 00:35:31.359
and I had this epiphany and it was like,

1002
00:35:31.359 --> 00:35:33.858
I had been dating and almost tried

1003
00:35:33.858 --> 00:35:35.939
to marry his potential.

1004
00:35:35.939 --> 00:35:39.059
I let 10% be enough.

1005
00:35:39.059 --> 00:35:41.599
Because 10%, even 20 maybe.

1006
00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:46.599
Because what if all I did was love?

1007
00:35:46.818 --> 00:35:48.820
Is that enough?

1008
00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:50.138
<v Regina>Yeah.</v>

1009
00:35:50.138 --> 00:35:52.739
Within us there appears to be this absurd

1010
00:35:52.739 --> 00:35:53.959
notion of perfection,

1011
00:35:53.959 --> 00:35:56.458
either projecting it on others or ourselves

1012
00:35:56.458 --> 00:35:59.039
and that's what this--

1013
00:35:59.039 --> 00:36:00.879
we really have to toss that part out.

1014
00:36:00.879 --> 00:36:02.799
We're all a work in progress.

1015
00:36:02.799 --> 00:36:03.979
<v ->Thank goodness.</v>

1016
00:36:03.979 --> 00:36:06.540
It would all be quite boring if we weren't.

1017
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.178
That's the self-compassion piece.

1018
00:36:09.178 --> 00:36:13.299
I find especially with women who are high achievers

1019
00:36:13.299 --> 00:36:16.499
that we are not very compassionate with ourselves.

1020
00:36:16.499 --> 00:36:19.379
We have inside us what my partner at

1021
00:36:19.379 --> 00:36:20.939
school called--

1022
00:36:20.939 --> 00:36:23.158
you talked with Amy recently.

1023
00:36:23.158 --> 00:36:28.158
And she will wreak havoc in your love life for sure.

1024
00:36:28.939 --> 00:36:31.839
<v Regina>That self-criticism that's programmed in.</v>

1025
00:36:31.839 --> 00:36:35.379
<v ->And also, I know me, when I'm being hard on myself</v>

1026
00:36:35.379 --> 00:36:37.859
who do you think I'm also hard on?

1027
00:36:37.859 --> 00:36:39.419
Noah.

1028
00:36:39.419 --> 00:36:42.839
It's really easy when I'm not feeling great about my body,

1029
00:36:42.839 --> 00:36:45.979
I'm not loving my body to look at Noah.

1030
00:36:45.979 --> 00:36:47.739
"Why are you having that pizza?"

1031
00:36:47.739 --> 00:36:51.739
This is one of the things that really works

1032
00:36:51.739 --> 00:36:52.739
in our relationship.

1033
00:36:52.739 --> 00:36:53.559
Projecting.

1034
00:36:53.559 --> 00:36:56.478
It's that choice of going love or fear.

1035
00:36:56.478 --> 00:36:58.439
So, in that moment, because I'm practicing

1036
00:36:58.439 --> 00:37:00.919
this fear to love is

1037
00:37:00.919 --> 00:37:04.478
oh, I'm afraid that I'm gaining weight.

1038
00:37:04.478 --> 00:37:08.219
I'm afraid that I'm not having a good relationship

1039
00:37:08.219 --> 00:37:09.399
with food right now.

1040
00:37:09.399 --> 00:37:11.678
That's the fear.

1041
00:37:11.678 --> 00:37:14.579
If I can look at the fear, then it allows me

1042
00:37:14.579 --> 00:37:18.559
to choose love for myself and also for Noah.

1043
00:37:18.559 --> 00:37:22.020
<v Regina>So, in the end, it sounds like the basis</v>

1044
00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:26.059
for this is really honesty and I don't mean radical honesty

1045
00:37:26.059 --> 00:37:28.319
as in the movement "radical honesty,"

1046
00:37:28.319 --> 00:37:31.039
I mean really deep internal honesty.

1047
00:37:31.039 --> 00:37:33.259
So, if we don't go through that process

1048
00:37:33.259 --> 00:37:34.819
as you say in your book,

1049
00:37:34.819 --> 00:37:39.819
we're really not in a fit position to be choosing externals.

1050
00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:42.859
<v ->I also want to offer something to everyone.</v>

1051
00:37:42.859 --> 00:37:44.699
I call it an Honesty Hearing.

1052
00:37:44.699 --> 00:37:46.179
One of the things that hardest about honesty

1053
00:37:46.179 --> 00:37:47.499
is when you're not being honest with yourself.

1054
00:37:47.499 --> 00:37:48.424
You don't know--

1055
00:37:48.424 --> 00:37:49.725
well, you usually know--

1056
00:37:49.725 --> 00:37:51.085
but you don't know how to get honest.

1057
00:37:51.085 --> 00:37:53.344
So, I love to give people self-love dares

1058
00:37:53.344 --> 00:37:54.904
because I think self-love is a daring act.

1059
00:37:54.904 --> 00:37:56.184
One I give to myself,

1060
00:37:56.184 --> 00:37:58.485
and actually Noah and I do this about every quarter,

1061
00:37:58.485 --> 00:38:00.305
it's called an Honesty Hearing.

1062
00:38:00.305 --> 00:38:01.765
H-e-a-r-i-n-g.

1063
00:38:01.765 --> 00:38:04.025
Where you get a friend or your partner

1064
00:38:04.025 --> 00:38:05.725
and you sit down with each other and

1065
00:38:05.725 --> 00:38:08.345
you look at your friend and you just basically say,

1066
00:38:08.345 --> 00:38:11.525
"Can you please tell me how I'm not being honest

1067
00:38:11.525 --> 00:38:13.825
"to myself in my life?"

1068
00:38:13.825 --> 00:38:16.305
And you just be quiet and you listen

1069
00:38:16.305 --> 00:38:19.665
to what that person says and you just receive it.

1070
00:38:19.665 --> 00:38:21.405
Then you just say "thank you."

1071
00:38:21.405 --> 00:38:23.565
You could ask a clarifying question or two,

1072
00:38:23.565 --> 00:38:25.525
but you can't defend yourself,

1073
00:38:25.525 --> 00:38:27.165
you can't get skeptical in your head.

1074
00:38:27.165 --> 00:38:29.805
You just open up your heart and receive it.

1075
00:38:29.805 --> 00:38:32.285
Then you do the same for them.

1076
00:38:32.285 --> 00:38:34.305
Then, at another time if you want to come back,

1077
00:38:34.305 --> 00:38:37.545
or later and say, "I could really use your help."

1078
00:38:37.545 --> 00:38:38.985
Then do that.

1079
00:38:38.985 --> 00:38:41.485
But it's such a great practice.

1080
00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:44.666
I can remember, one of my best friends.

1081
00:38:44.666 --> 00:38:46.665
So funny, he--

1082
00:38:46.665 --> 00:38:50.085
we all knew he shouldn't get married

1083
00:38:50.085 --> 00:38:53.385
and he was the nicest guy, just the nicest guy in the world.

1084
00:38:53.385 --> 00:38:57.225
Three weeks before his wedding I sat down with him

1085
00:38:57.225 --> 00:38:58.305
and I said,

1086
00:38:58.305 --> 00:39:00.465
"Are you happy?"

1087
00:39:00.465 --> 00:39:02.925
And he said yes.

1088
00:39:02.925 --> 00:39:05.085
He lied, he lied.

1089
00:39:05.085 --> 00:39:06.985
Six months later he was divorced.

1090
00:39:06.985 --> 00:39:10.664
He lost his house, he lost his car, he lost his job.

1091
00:39:10.664 --> 00:39:15.265
Two years of depression from all of this.

1092
00:39:15.265 --> 00:39:19.945
If I had had permission to be able to be honest with him,

1093
00:39:19.945 --> 00:39:22.205
if he was honest with himself and he was open to

1094
00:39:22.205 --> 00:39:24.705
that kind of honesty from any one of our friends,

1095
00:39:24.705 --> 00:39:28.045
the pain he would have saved himself

1096
00:39:28.045 --> 00:39:29.185
would have been immense.

1097
00:39:29.185 --> 00:39:31.964
I think that's the piece, going back to our inner wisdom,

1098
00:39:31.964 --> 00:39:35.465
our intuition is also telling us whether you're feeling it

1099
00:39:35.465 --> 00:39:39.585
in your belly or, one of my best friends who I write about,

1100
00:39:39.585 --> 00:39:42.005
in the book she--

1101
00:39:42.005 --> 00:39:43.865
the day she met her ex-husband,

1102
00:39:43.865 --> 00:39:45.205
before they ever even went on a date,

1103
00:39:45.205 --> 00:39:46.525
her intuition screams in her head,

1104
00:39:46.525 --> 00:39:48.205
"Don't go out with him.

1105
00:39:48.205 --> 00:39:51.065
"He will ruin your life."

1106
00:39:51.065 --> 00:39:52.265
So she dates him, she marries him,

1107
00:39:52.265 --> 00:39:53.505
has two children with him.

1108
00:39:53.505 --> 00:39:54.825
Ten years later, she's stuck in a city

1109
00:39:54.825 --> 00:39:56.164
she doesn't want to live in.

1110
00:39:56.164 --> 00:39:58.405
Fighting for her children two years ago

1111
00:39:58.405 --> 00:40:01.845
in custody court and you know what happened for her?

1112
00:40:01.845 --> 00:40:03.625
Her dream of being a writer?

1113
00:40:03.625 --> 00:40:05.086
On hold.

1114
00:40:05.086 --> 00:40:07.425
Because she's so distracted with

1115
00:40:07.425 --> 00:40:09.965
having to deal with all of this that

1116
00:40:09.965 --> 00:40:14.525
she has put her dream on hold for ten years.

1117
00:40:14.525 --> 00:40:18.125
<v Regina>Yes and I think everyone listening to this</v>

1118
00:40:18.125 --> 00:40:21.525
can certainly relate to the moments where there

1119
00:40:21.525 --> 00:40:24.565
are repercussions of not listening to your higher truth,

1120
00:40:24.565 --> 00:40:26.425
your internal truth so yes.

1121
00:40:26.425 --> 00:40:28.725
<v ->Me too.</v>

1122
00:40:28.725 --> 00:40:30.826
That's why we need these Honesty Hearings

1123
00:40:30.826 --> 00:40:32.665
where there's partnerships with people.

1124
00:40:32.665 --> 00:40:34.866
Help me see what I'm not seeing.

1125
00:40:34.866 --> 00:40:37.545
<v Regina>Don't you feel that you would</v>

1126
00:40:37.545 --> 00:40:39.546
need to choose someone that you have trust in?

1127
00:40:39.546 --> 00:40:41.145
You can't do this with just anybody.

1128
00:40:41.145 --> 00:40:41.925
<v ->Oh, of course.</v>

1129
00:40:41.925 --> 00:40:43.165
Like I wouldn't call my mother.

1130
00:40:43.165 --> 00:40:45.165
(laughing)

1131
00:40:45.165 --> 00:40:47.804
<v Regina>So, you find a partner that you already</v>

1132
00:40:47.804 --> 00:40:50.945
have trust in, or a friend and I can,

1133
00:40:50.945 --> 00:40:52.245
just when you're talking,

1134
00:40:52.245 --> 00:40:55.044
you can feel the fresh air and the release

1135
00:40:55.044 --> 00:40:57.825
coming into your own life and also,

1136
00:40:57.825 --> 00:40:59.685
the relationship even with that person.

1137
00:40:59.685 --> 00:41:02.906
There's a release of something that's occurring there.

1138
00:41:02.906 --> 00:41:07.225
Because that repression it takes to keep untruths

1139
00:41:07.225 --> 00:41:10.725
contained within, that creates a lot of internal tension.

1140
00:41:10.725 --> 00:41:13.765
I can feel what you're talking about the truth in it.

1141
00:41:13.765 --> 00:41:16.085
Just let it blow out.

1142
00:41:16.085 --> 00:41:18.885
<v ->It releases, it releases all that fear.</v>

1143
00:41:18.885 --> 00:41:22.125
Fear contracts, love expands so it allows it.

1144
00:41:22.125 --> 00:41:24.465
And just to be able to be witnessed by someone else

1145
00:41:24.465 --> 00:41:25.825
who you know is not going to judge you,

1146
00:41:25.825 --> 00:41:27.825
because you know you're judging yourself.

1147
00:41:27.825 --> 00:41:30.645
Like I said, it took me five years to forgive myself

1148
00:41:30.645 --> 00:41:32.785
for almost ending up selling cheese for a living

1149
00:41:32.785 --> 00:41:34.125
and that's what I would have done,

1150
00:41:34.125 --> 00:41:36.244
I would have ended up selling cheese and

1151
00:41:36.244 --> 00:41:38.765
I don't even like processed cheese.

1152
00:41:38.765 --> 00:41:39.485
(laughter)

1153
00:41:39.485 --> 00:41:40.425
It wasn't even good cheese.

1154
00:41:40.425 --> 00:41:44.511
<v Regina>That would have been a compromise.</v>

1155
00:41:44.511 --> 00:41:45.611
Well, Christine,

1156
00:41:45.611 --> 00:41:48.090
anything else before we sign off here?

1157
00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:49.850
Any other kind of final take-aways for people

1158
00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:51.131
that we haven't touched on?

1159
00:41:51.131 --> 00:41:52.350
<v ->Well, I would love to offer everyone</v>

1160
00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:55.131
the real definition of self-love if I can.

1161
00:41:55.131 --> 00:41:57.511
The definition that I have found and written

1162
00:41:57.511 --> 00:42:00.610
and invite everyone to close their eyes

1163
00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:02.610
because I'm going to close my eyes

1164
00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:03.710
to be able to share it here.

1165
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:06.750
Just close your eyes, take a breath,

1166
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:09.590
open your heart and let the real definition

1167
00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.931
of self-love sink into your mind and your body

1168
00:42:11.931 --> 00:42:14.750
and your spirit.

1169
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:19.070
So, self-love is the unconditional love and respect

1170
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:22.270
that you have for yourself that is so solid,

1171
00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:26.910
so unwavering that you only choose and allow

1172
00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:29.751
situations and relationships,

1173
00:42:29.751 --> 00:42:32.111
including the one you have with yourself

1174
00:42:32.111 --> 00:42:34.910
that reflect that same unwavering respect

1175
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:38.270
and unconditional love.

1176
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:40.251
<v Regina>On that note, I thank you very much.</v>

1177
00:42:40.251 --> 00:42:41.930
That's beautiful

1178
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:43.571
Thank you, Christine.

1179
00:42:43.571 --> 00:42:46.401
<v ->Thank you so much.</v>

1180
00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:49.170
<v ->You can delve deeper into this workbook</v>

1181
00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:51.690
by going to mebeforewe.com

1182
00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:53.090
or you can order through Amazon.

1183
00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:55.010
It's a good gift for someone who is drowning

1184
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.591
in their relationship.

1185
00:42:56.591 --> 00:42:59.750
It's no secret that the most difficult task of being human

1186
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.711
is to learn to live in peace and harmony

1187
00:43:01.711 --> 00:43:03.251
with our closest partners.

1188
00:43:03.251 --> 00:43:06.670
"Choosing Me Before We" offers some practical assistance.

1189
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:10.301
Until next time, thanks for watching CMN.
