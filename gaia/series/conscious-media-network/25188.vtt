(bright, ambient, electronic music)

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:16.591
<v ->One of the most intriguing people</v>

3
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:18.660
of the 20th century, in my opinion

4
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.745
was the man known as the sleeping prophet, Edgar Cayce.

5
00:00:22.745 --> 00:00:26.628
His work has been documented in over 14,000 readings,

6
00:00:26.628 --> 00:00:28.402
which have been studied in great depths

7
00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:30.078
for several decades now.

8
00:00:30.078 --> 00:00:31.240
Most of us know that he gave

9
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.309
amazingly accurate medical advice

10
00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.093
and diagnosis during the first part of the last century.

11
00:00:36.093 --> 00:00:38.109
But what is less known is the scope

12
00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:39.826
of his influence in the world.

13
00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:41.778
From presidents and oil magnets,

14
00:00:41.778 --> 00:00:45.309
to movie stars and mostly, ordinary citizens in need.

15
00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.655
His readings were sought worldwide.

16
00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:49.650
Edgar was able to access the greater field

17
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.644
of consciousness, without filters.

18
00:00:51.644 --> 00:00:53.617
Time and space were not relevant

19
00:00:53.617 --> 00:00:55.196
as his remote readings proved

20
00:00:55.196 --> 00:00:57.969
to be accurate the vast majority of the time.

21
00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.028
No one has captured Cayce's life in a more

22
00:01:00.028 --> 00:01:03.974
detailed way than biographer and author, Sidney Kirkpatrick.

23
00:01:03.974 --> 00:01:07.059
Who wrote, "Edgar Cayce: An American Prophet."

24
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.376
You've written a lot of books.

25
00:01:12.376 --> 00:01:14.061
As we were talking about off camera,

26
00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:15.703
you spend a lot of time in archives,

27
00:01:15.703 --> 00:01:17.954
writing about various dead people.

28
00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:20.418
But the defining point in your life

29
00:01:20.418 --> 00:01:22.092
was really when you encountered

30
00:01:22.092 --> 00:01:24.087
Edgar Cayce's work.

31
00:01:24.087 --> 00:01:25.569
And the life of Edgar Cayce.

32
00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.407
By the way, your book is phenomenal.

33
00:01:28.407 --> 00:01:31.841
In terms of just detailing all the richness of his life.

34
00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:33.910
A beautiful biography, and I'll say right up front,

35
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.670
anyone interested in Edgar Cayce's life

36
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.921
really should delve into your work.

37
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:40.043
But what happened to you when you came

38
00:01:40.043 --> 00:01:41.975
in contact with Cayce's work initially?

39
00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:42.999
Why did you?

40
00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:44.556
What motivated you?

41
00:01:44.556 --> 00:01:46.252
And then how did that start effecting

42
00:01:46.252 --> 00:01:49.319
and coloring the rest of your work in life.

43
00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:54.562
<v ->Well, I was literally pulled in kicking and screaming.</v>

44
00:01:54.562 --> 00:01:57.448
I didn't want anything to do with Edgar Cayce.

45
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.500
I had some vague idea about who Edgar Cayce was

46
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.419
and the administrator at my childrens' school,

47
00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:09.786
long-time Edgar Cayce fan.

48
00:02:09.786 --> 00:02:14.127
Had been studying Edgar Cayce since she was in high school.

49
00:02:14.127 --> 00:02:18.682
She immediately identified me as a biographer

50
00:02:18.682 --> 00:02:21.028
parent in this school, and she said

51
00:02:21.028 --> 00:02:24.228
you have to get an Edgar Cayce biography.

52
00:02:24.228 --> 00:02:26.966
She just laid into me, day in and day out.

53
00:02:26.966 --> 00:02:31.777
First in Edgar Cayce Venture Inward magazines

54
00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:36.374
in the school mailbox, the old 1940's

55
00:02:36.374 --> 00:02:39.488
biography of Cayce, "There is a River."

56
00:02:39.488 --> 00:02:42.251
She just kept bombarding me with this stuff.

57
00:02:42.251 --> 00:02:46.496
She seemed articulate, delightful,

58
00:02:46.496 --> 00:02:49.653
but I didn't want anything to do with it.

59
00:02:49.653 --> 00:02:51.958
Ridiculous.

60
00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.390
I was of the opinion that anyone

61
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.438
who put their faith in a psychic

62
00:02:56.438 --> 00:02:58.592
oughta visit a psychiatrist.

63
00:02:58.592 --> 00:03:02.731
But of course now, I feel like

64
00:03:02.731 --> 00:03:04.682
every psychiatrist oughta consult a psychic.

65
00:03:04.682 --> 00:03:05.590
(laughing)

66
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.672
Before the ever treat a patient.

67
00:03:06.672 --> 00:03:08.536
<v ->Well, there's one big conversion.</v>

68
00:03:08.536 --> 00:03:11.970
<v ->It was a real tug of war.</v>

69
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.500
She kept asking me, "Well, what did you think?"

70
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.540
I was too embarrassed to even admit

71
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.939
I hadn't even looked at the stuff.

72
00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.497
I kept throwing it in the back of the car.

73
00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.959
It went back and forth like that

74
00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.444
and finally, she pushed me to the point

75
00:03:28.444 --> 00:03:32.727
where I actually did, I sat down and I read this biography.

76
00:03:34.226 --> 00:03:35.453
I just didn't buy it.

77
00:03:35.453 --> 00:03:40.453
I said, any story that's too good to be true, isn't.

78
00:03:42.217 --> 00:03:47.217
As well meaning as these Edgar Cayce fans are,

79
00:03:48.712 --> 00:03:51.688
it's been my experience as a biographer,

80
00:03:51.688 --> 00:03:55.596
because I've been 20, 25 years,

81
00:03:55.596 --> 00:03:57.495
behind a keyboard writing biographies.

82
00:03:57.495 --> 00:04:00.242
Studying people's lives.

83
00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:03.096
These stories get embellished over the years.

84
00:04:03.096 --> 00:04:04.745
They get embroidered.

85
00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:14.948
You may find them fascinating, but I was sure

86
00:04:14.948 --> 00:04:17.059
that if you really got to the bottom of it,

87
00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:19.481
if you really put your foot down

88
00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:22.606
and got into the archives and started studying this stuff,

89
00:04:22.606 --> 00:04:26.164
the stories about Edgar Cayce wouldn't hold up.

90
00:04:26.164 --> 00:04:31.164
So, we were having this tug of war, and as it turned out

91
00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.728
we were headed to Washington, D.C., essentially.

92
00:04:34.728 --> 00:04:37.028
On the same plane.

93
00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:40.585
The argument just picked up,

94
00:04:40.585 --> 00:04:42.281
right where it had dropped off

95
00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:44.734
at the Pasadena Waldorf School.

96
00:04:44.734 --> 00:04:46.964
<v ->I thought you were probably talking about Waldorf.</v>

97
00:04:46.964 --> 00:04:49.587
Because of the Steiner works and so forth.

98
00:04:49.587 --> 00:04:50.825
I understand that.

99
00:04:50.825 --> 00:04:51.731
<v ->Yeah.</v>

100
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:53.139
<v Regina>My son went there too.</v>

101
00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:53.907
<v ->Which one?</v>

102
00:04:53.907 --> 00:04:56.606
<v Regina>Sacramento, right next to the Steiner College.</v>

103
00:04:56.606 --> 00:04:58.110
<v ->Yeah, excellent.</v>

104
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.105
All four of our kids have been through the Waldorf System.

105
00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.289
But so, push came to shove and we ended up

106
00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.796
here in the library right over here.

107
00:05:07.796 --> 00:05:09.278
I was determined I was gonna go in

108
00:05:09.278 --> 00:05:11.721
and I was gonna pick out one of these

109
00:05:11.721 --> 00:05:14.526
alleged readings and I was gonna pick my way through it

110
00:05:14.526 --> 00:05:17.912
and I would show her the error of her ways.

111
00:05:18.664 --> 00:05:22.771
I think that was on a Thursday afternoon we arrived.

112
00:05:22.771 --> 00:05:25.160
On Sunday morning, I was still looking for that reading

113
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.160
that was gonna show her how false these things really were.

114
00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:31.869
I couldn't find it.

115
00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:33.127
<v Regina>Harry Houdini, later,</v>

116
00:05:33.127 --> 00:05:34.546
tried to do the same thing right?

117
00:05:34.546 --> 00:05:35.239
<v ->Yeah.</v>

118
00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:37.256
(Regina laughing)

119
00:05:37.256 --> 00:05:41.319
That eventually led to a visit to the vault.

120
00:05:45.016 --> 00:05:47.136
<v Regina>Explain what the vault is.</v>

121
00:05:48.826 --> 00:05:53.826
<v ->All of Edgar Cayce's extant papers, correspondence,</v>

122
00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:57.315
have all been collected, and they're together

123
00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.192
at the vault in Virginia Beach

124
00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:02.285
at the A.R.E. Headquarters.

125
00:06:02.285 --> 00:06:04.653
Along with the original readings,

126
00:06:04.653 --> 00:06:06.295
the ones that were transcribed,

127
00:06:06.295 --> 00:06:08.802
right here behind us.

128
00:06:08.802 --> 00:06:11.618
<v Regina>Yes, we're right in front of the famous sofa.</v>

129
00:06:11.618 --> 00:06:12.802
Such a thrill.

130
00:06:12.802 --> 00:06:14.380
<v Sydney>The sofa where Cayce gave readings.</v>

131
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.905
There's pictures of Gladys Davis,

132
00:06:15.905 --> 00:06:18.369
who was Edgar Cayce's secretary.

133
00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:21.277
Who transcribed the readings.

134
00:06:22.307 --> 00:06:26.114
I think, my experience is very similar

135
00:06:26.114 --> 00:06:29.410
to almost every skeptic who takes

136
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.507
the time and trouble to actually go in

137
00:06:31.507 --> 00:06:33.568
and start looking at the material.

138
00:06:33.568 --> 00:06:38.568
Once you go in, the first thing that strikes you is

139
00:06:40.781 --> 00:06:42.985
the sheer number of readings.

140
00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:48.196
We're not speaking 200 readings, 500.

141
00:06:48.196 --> 00:06:51.486
Well over 14,000.

142
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.971
Think of it, this is twice a day, everyday for 45 years.

143
00:06:58.913 --> 00:07:03.578
You have the sheer volume of readings.

144
00:07:03.578 --> 00:07:06.912
And then you have the specificity.

145
00:07:08.124 --> 00:07:11.931
Edgar Cayce didn't speak in these vague ambiguous terms,

146
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:16.931
which so often we think of when we think of

147
00:07:16.998 --> 00:07:21.552
trance communicated information.

148
00:07:21.552 --> 00:07:25.189
He spoke names, dates, in terms of

149
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:27.024
the physical readings, body parts,

150
00:07:27.024 --> 00:07:30.277
organ by organ, blood type, red blood count,

151
00:07:30.277 --> 00:07:32.922
white blood count, these are specifics.

152
00:07:32.922 --> 00:07:35.429
Things you really hold onto and really test.

153
00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:42.209
As I said, he didn't do this in a limited number of times.

154
00:07:43.511 --> 00:07:46.388
14,000 times, just think about it.

155
00:07:49.433 --> 00:07:53.124
As one gets into it, it's no longer

156
00:07:53.124 --> 00:07:57.855
a question of did he do what he is said to have done.

157
00:07:59.322 --> 00:08:01.924
One starts asking, how did he do it?

158
00:08:01.924 --> 00:08:05.849
Because the evidence is so overwhelming

159
00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:10.094
that even an extreme skeptic coming into this,

160
00:08:10.094 --> 00:08:12.633
when you see the volume of the material,

161
00:08:12.633 --> 00:08:16.755
and you see the documentation behind it.

162
00:08:17.294 --> 00:08:20.547
As you go into the vault, you'll see one

163
00:08:20.547 --> 00:08:23.192
not only has the trance reading that Edgar Cayce

164
00:08:23.192 --> 00:08:27.651
gave for that individual, but you have pages and pages

165
00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:31.778
of background documentation that goes along with it.

166
00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:34.082
You have testimony of the witnesses

167
00:08:34.082 --> 00:08:36.448
who were there when Cayce gave that reading.

168
00:08:38.523 --> 00:08:43.354
If you were to pick any psychic of world history out,

169
00:08:43.354 --> 00:08:47.205
to prove the truth of psychic phenomena,

170
00:08:47.205 --> 00:08:48.783
you just come to Edgar Cayce.

171
00:08:48.783 --> 00:08:50.063
<v Regina>Edgar Cayce, absolutely.</v>

172
00:08:50.063 --> 00:08:53.029
<v ->I wouldn't say that Edgar Cayce</v>

173
00:08:53.029 --> 00:08:55.311
was the greatest psychic who ever lived,

174
00:08:55.311 --> 00:08:56.196
because I think there have been

175
00:08:56.196 --> 00:08:57.978
many, many important psychics.

176
00:08:57.978 --> 00:09:01.135
But, if you're looking for evidence.

177
00:09:01.135 --> 00:09:02.255
<v Regina>Documentation.</v>

178
00:09:02.255 --> 00:09:06.084
<v ->Hard proof of the truth of psychic phenomenon,</v>

179
00:09:06.084 --> 00:09:08.121
you just look in the vault.

180
00:09:08.121 --> 00:09:09.613
You go through this transition,

181
00:09:09.613 --> 00:09:11.302
you stop asking yourself,

182
00:09:11.302 --> 00:09:13.821
"Did Edgar Cayce do what he is said to have done?"

183
00:09:13.821 --> 00:09:17.053
Because the evidence is just overwhelming.

184
00:09:17.053 --> 00:09:19.325
Then you start asking, "How?"

185
00:09:20.216 --> 00:09:21.400
That's what gets you.

186
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.630
As soon as you make that leap,

187
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.908
at least it was for me, I couldn't turn away from it.

188
00:09:27.908 --> 00:09:32.908
Because, it opens up a Pandora's box of questions.

189
00:09:35.632 --> 00:09:38.309
As a journalist, investigator,

190
00:09:38.309 --> 00:09:40.122
you want to get to the bottom of it.

191
00:09:40.122 --> 00:09:44.457
And so, what ultimately happened is,

192
00:09:44.457 --> 00:09:47.155
yes, that was my next book.

193
00:09:47.155 --> 00:09:49.250
Next biography.

194
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.083
I think up unto that point,

195
00:09:52.083 --> 00:09:54.376
I don't think I'd ever spent more than 2 years

196
00:09:54.376 --> 00:09:56.603
researching a book.

197
00:09:57.836 --> 00:10:02.071
The contract that I made with my publisher

198
00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:06.427
was as a skeptic, I would write whatever I found.

199
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:10.680
I think the editors imagined Sidney Kirkpatrick

200
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.879
going into this subject is gonna be

201
00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:15.815
shaking skeletons in the closet.

202
00:10:15.815 --> 00:10:16.828
<v Regina>Right.</v>

203
00:10:16.828 --> 00:10:19.111
No, that's not what happened.

204
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:20.785
(Regina laughing)

205
00:10:20.785 --> 00:10:25.785
<v ->Five years later, my editor in New York called me,</v>

206
00:10:26.395 --> 00:10:27.889
"Sid, Sid, where are you?"

207
00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:29.905
"We're late on this book?"

208
00:10:29.905 --> 00:10:31.559
<v Regina>It shows in your work though</v>

209
00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:33.660
it was worth the patience.

210
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.857
<v ->I told them I was in the Akashic Records.</v>

211
00:10:36.857 --> 00:10:40.916
He said, "Okay, let me know when you check out."

212
00:10:40.916 --> 00:10:42.904
(laughing)

213
00:10:44.147 --> 00:10:46.281
The book, which was envisioned

214
00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:48.414
as being something relatively short,

215
00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:52.019
250 pages, became a mammoth,

216
00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:56.584
but it was a life-changer for me.

217
00:10:56.584 --> 00:10:58.397
<v Regina>It's such an engaging read too.</v>

218
00:10:58.397 --> 00:11:00.392
But you cannot have been exposed

219
00:11:00.392 --> 00:11:03.442
to that information and not have been a changed person.

220
00:11:03.442 --> 00:11:06.269
<v ->It's effected almost everything I do,</v>

221
00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:11.175
from the way I treat my children and my wife, and marriage

222
00:11:11.175 --> 00:11:15.342
in general, to how I approach every new project.

223
00:11:16.137 --> 00:11:17.641
I start looking at different things.

224
00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:21.779
I ask, from a biographer's point of view,

225
00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:26.779
"Why is this soul come, incarnated, on earth?"

226
00:11:26.995 --> 00:11:30.227
I don't bold and come out and ask that question,

227
00:11:30.227 --> 00:11:31.507
but that's what I'm asking.

228
00:11:31.507 --> 00:11:32.755
Who is their team?

229
00:11:32.755 --> 00:11:34.963
Who did they come to participate with?

230
00:11:34.963 --> 00:11:39.538
What was their challenge and what was the goal?

231
00:11:39.538 --> 00:11:42.219
Did they accomplish that or not?

232
00:11:42.739 --> 00:11:44.969
No matter what I'm doing,

233
00:11:44.969 --> 00:11:47.430
I'm thinking along those terms.

234
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.478
That's really from a career point of view.

235
00:11:49.478 --> 00:11:52.240
From a medical point of view,

236
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.280
we don't visit a physician until we've

237
00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.337
searched the Edgar Cayce material.

238
00:11:59.601 --> 00:12:04.601
It is such a wide range of resources, those readings.

239
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.203
It's so easy now to search on a computer

240
00:12:12.203 --> 00:12:14.731
or computer database, that you can find

241
00:12:14.731 --> 00:12:17.966
treatments and remedies for virtually everything.

242
00:12:17.966 --> 00:12:19.241
<v Regina>Do you mind if I talk about</v>

243
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:20.448
the one we spoke of off camera?

244
00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:21.190
About hair?

245
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.699
<v ->Oh sure, male-pattern baldness.</v>

246
00:12:23.699 --> 00:12:24.926
<v Regina>Yeah, I love it.</v>

247
00:12:24.926 --> 00:12:25.910
So you were concerned about

248
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.392
male-pattern baldness, you weren't happy

249
00:12:27.392 --> 00:12:29.184
with the thickness of your hair.

250
00:12:29.184 --> 00:12:31.456
And so, sure enough, in the Cayce archives

251
00:12:31.456 --> 00:12:33.463
you were able to find some information on it,

252
00:12:33.463 --> 00:12:35.895
and now, voilà, you have beautiful hair.

253
00:12:35.895 --> 00:12:40.895
<v ->I wanted to test the remedies, the treatments myself.</v>

254
00:12:41.986 --> 00:12:43.828
<v Regina>Big pay off too.</v>

255
00:12:43.828 --> 00:12:45.732
<v ->Several things we wanted to do,</v>

256
00:12:45.732 --> 00:12:48.831
as we started in this research.

257
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.770
Believe me, it was a team effort.

258
00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:56.770
Nancy, who became my wife, we devoted

259
00:12:58.085 --> 00:13:01.263
5, 6 years, driving across the country, researching.

260
00:13:02.493 --> 00:13:04.581
We not only wanted to visit people

261
00:13:04.581 --> 00:13:05.647
who had actually had readings,

262
00:13:05.647 --> 00:13:07.045
but we wanted to use the treatments.

263
00:13:07.045 --> 00:13:08.943
Of course, I immediately latched on

264
00:13:08.943 --> 00:13:12.508
to hair loss treatments.

265
00:13:12.508 --> 00:13:14.097
<v Regina>And you say your hair's</v>

266
00:13:14.097 --> 00:13:15.624
thicker now than it was 20 years ago?

267
00:13:15.624 --> 00:13:16.925
<v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v>

268
00:13:16.925 --> 00:13:18.248
And growing.

269
00:13:18.248 --> 00:13:19.197
<v Regina>That's fabulous.</v>

270
00:13:19.197 --> 00:13:22.053
Well, that's just one.

271
00:13:22.053 --> 00:13:24.354
Thousands of people's lives were literally

272
00:13:24.354 --> 00:13:27.959
saved as a result of having had the courage

273
00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:29.858
against ridicule, in those days,

274
00:13:29.858 --> 00:13:32.919
from family members, to have reached out

275
00:13:32.919 --> 00:13:34.797
to Edgar for information.

276
00:13:34.797 --> 00:13:36.726
One of the things that really strikes me

277
00:13:36.726 --> 00:13:40.566
in reading your book, is that I didn't

278
00:13:40.566 --> 00:13:45.245
really understand the colorful nature of his life.

279
00:13:45.245 --> 00:13:48.303
Prior to the time when he and Gladys Davis,

280
00:13:48.303 --> 00:13:50.852
hooked up and they started documenting

281
00:13:50.852 --> 00:13:52.473
all of his medical readings.

282
00:13:52.473 --> 00:13:54.937
That's the part of Cayce that I was more familiar with.

283
00:13:54.937 --> 00:13:57.795
And I think most of us know him by.

284
00:13:57.795 --> 00:14:00.995
But looking at your work, this man,

285
00:14:00.995 --> 00:14:03.139
because he was who he was and had these

286
00:14:03.139 --> 00:14:06.712
incredible capabilities, was really tested

287
00:14:06.712 --> 00:14:07.960
by a lot of people.

288
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.008
Exploited by a lot of people.

289
00:14:10.008 --> 00:14:13.954
He was sought after by the well-known.

290
00:14:13.954 --> 00:14:15.789
People who've gone down in history.

291
00:14:15.789 --> 00:14:19.415
Such as presidents, at least one that I know of,

292
00:14:19.415 --> 00:14:20.781
that you wrote about.

293
00:14:20.781 --> 00:14:22.690
Also, Edison and Tesla who were

294
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.173
hooked in on similar levels.

295
00:14:24.173 --> 00:14:26.071
Well, Tesla anyway, right?

296
00:14:26.071 --> 00:14:28.908
This man had, he was very ...

297
00:14:28.908 --> 00:14:31.511
His abilities were well-known.

298
00:14:31.511 --> 00:14:33.505
Certainly throughout the United States and even world.

299
00:14:33.505 --> 00:14:34.295
Weren't they?

300
00:14:34.295 --> 00:14:35.626
<v ->Yeah.</v>

301
00:14:35.886 --> 00:14:38.933
As a, coming at this from the

302
00:14:38.933 --> 00:14:43.349
point of view of a researcher, biographer,

303
00:14:43.349 --> 00:14:45.971
one of the first really exciting

304
00:14:45.971 --> 00:14:49.797
to my mind discoveries, when I got into the vault.

305
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:58.270
Just like a physician patient relationship,

306
00:14:58.539 --> 00:15:02.542
the names of people who'd had these readings,

307
00:15:02.542 --> 00:15:06.587
and there's well over 6 - 7,000 of them.

308
00:15:06.587 --> 00:15:08.338
Were kept private.

309
00:15:09.218 --> 00:15:10.640
<v Regina>It was just a case number.</v>

310
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.888
<v ->Yes.</v>

311
00:15:13.128 --> 00:15:16.519
Up until when Nancy and I,

312
00:15:16.519 --> 00:15:21.287
really were granted unrestricted access to that vault.

313
00:15:21.287 --> 00:15:23.633
That's how it had always been.

314
00:15:23.633 --> 00:15:24.860
For good reasons.

315
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.788
There was no nefarious reason.

316
00:15:28.841 --> 00:15:30.793
But you didn't want family's

317
00:15:30.793 --> 00:15:34.119
personal medical problems,

318
00:15:34.119 --> 00:15:37.597
by and large, they're mostly medical readings.

319
00:15:38.019 --> 00:15:43.019
But when we put names to numbers,

320
00:15:43.267 --> 00:15:46.125
the first exciting thing for me was,

321
00:15:46.125 --> 00:15:49.187
"Oh my gosh, look at all these famous people."

322
00:15:49.187 --> 00:15:53.272
Gloria Swanson, George Gershwin,

323
00:15:53.272 --> 00:15:56.802
President of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company,

324
00:15:56.802 --> 00:16:01.802
Duponts, many very important people of his generation.

325
00:16:04.952 --> 00:16:09.923
World leaders, presidents, State Department officials.

326
00:16:09.923 --> 00:16:12.284
A vice-president of the United States.

327
00:16:13.101 --> 00:16:15.192
I immediately was very excited because,

328
00:16:15.192 --> 00:16:18.321
"Oh, look at this, look at all these famous people."

329
00:16:21.666 --> 00:16:22.946
It's interesting, because that's

330
00:16:22.946 --> 00:16:27.922
not ultimately where it went.

331
00:16:27.922 --> 00:16:32.922
At first, I was excited about the prospect of ...

332
00:16:33.141 --> 00:16:36.548
Actually, I was excited about the prospect of exploiting it.

333
00:16:36.548 --> 00:16:39.101
<v Regina>That's why I'm saying, most people would.</v>

334
00:16:41.181 --> 00:16:46.181
<v ->As I got into it, I began to realize that this really</v>

335
00:16:46.358 --> 00:16:51.002
isn't what the work is about at all.

336
00:16:54.443 --> 00:16:58.709
One of the powerful and convincing things

337
00:16:58.709 --> 00:17:01.642
to me as a biographer, was that Edgar Cayce

338
00:17:01.642 --> 00:17:03.775
himself, did not exploit that.

339
00:17:03.775 --> 00:17:06.047
He didn't go around beating his own drum.

340
00:17:06.047 --> 00:17:09.390
And could very easily have done that.

341
00:17:10.698 --> 00:17:12.575
Even though he was giving these readings

342
00:17:12.575 --> 00:17:15.236
to many important people, stockbrokers,

343
00:17:15.236 --> 00:17:19.535
oil men, people who were making a great deal of money,

344
00:17:19.535 --> 00:17:22.630
in some cases, on these readings.

345
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.507
<v Regina>And trying to draw him into their business.</v>

346
00:17:24.507 --> 00:17:26.043
<v ->Everything, he was giving readings for</v>

347
00:17:26.043 --> 00:17:31.043
everything from vending machines to airport landing,

348
00:17:31.333 --> 00:17:34.373
the landing lights on airstrips ...

349
00:17:34.373 --> 00:17:39.373
David Sarnoff, head of NBC, was getting readings

350
00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:42.661
on developing FM radio.

351
00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:47.098
Edgar Cayce himself was not going public with that.

352
00:17:47.098 --> 00:17:50.372
He kept it quiet, these are personal.

353
00:17:50.372 --> 00:17:53.881
He was doing it because he

354
00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:55.780
believed this was a gift from God

355
00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.529
and it was not to be exploited.

356
00:17:57.529 --> 00:18:01.444
So, A, that was very compelling.

357
00:18:01.444 --> 00:18:05.209
As I started really getting in and looking

358
00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:07.736
at the readings themselves, putting names

359
00:18:07.736 --> 00:18:12.736
to those numbers, a very interesting thing happened.

360
00:18:13.656 --> 00:18:17.144
Not only in my understanding of Edgar Cayce,

361
00:18:17.144 --> 00:18:22.144
but in a general, if there's any contribution

362
00:18:22.573 --> 00:18:26.711
however modest, that Sidney Kirkpatrick

363
00:18:26.711 --> 00:18:31.711
could make as a biographer, was understanding

364
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.243
how integrated all of these readings are.

365
00:18:36.243 --> 00:18:38.563
I'll give you examples.

366
00:18:41.864 --> 00:18:44.136
A trance reading you might just blow past,

367
00:18:44.136 --> 00:18:48.573
as a biographer, 14,000 plus readings,

368
00:18:48.573 --> 00:18:52.289
take you 3 and a half years to read your way

369
00:18:52.289 --> 00:18:55.612
from one end of this vault to the other.

370
00:18:56.472 --> 00:18:59.629
You go through some of these readings,

371
00:18:59.629 --> 00:19:02.149
not interested, you just blow right past it,

372
00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:03.664
if it doesn't catch your attention

373
00:19:03.664 --> 00:19:05.705
or isn't particularly long.

374
00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:08.678
I remember one reading in specific,

375
00:19:08.678 --> 00:19:13.678
it was for a older man from Selma, Alabama.

376
00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:19.082
Who's requesting a quote.

377
00:19:21.391 --> 00:19:24.422
"Can you recommend a good quote?"

378
00:19:24.422 --> 00:19:26.472
<v Regina>That's it?</v>

379
00:19:26.472 --> 00:19:30.173
<v ->Something I would have just breezed right past.</v>

380
00:19:30.173 --> 00:19:33.810
But putting names to these numbers.

381
00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:35.628
Okay, who is this guy?

382
00:19:36.523 --> 00:19:38.055
It's Lamar Jones.

383
00:19:38.055 --> 00:19:39.164
Who's Lamar Jones?

384
00:19:39.164 --> 00:19:42.784
He's a tombstone cutter from Selma, Alabama.

385
00:19:43.537 --> 00:19:46.536
He's looking for a quote for an inscription.

386
00:19:46.536 --> 00:19:48.256
On a tombstone.

387
00:19:48.256 --> 00:19:51.574
Oh, isn't this interesting, that his wife died

388
00:19:51.574 --> 00:19:55.962
three days before the request came for this.

389
00:19:56.939 --> 00:20:01.536
Oh, isn't this interesting that Lamar Jones

390
00:20:01.536 --> 00:20:04.452
and his wife are godparents for the Cayce children.

391
00:20:05.738 --> 00:20:09.268
Oh, isn't this interesting Lamar Jones

392
00:20:09.268 --> 00:20:12.206
is Edgar Cayce's favorite fishing buddy.

393
00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.348
All of a sudden, when you start putting

394
00:20:15.348 --> 00:20:18.505
flesh and blood, that request,

395
00:20:18.505 --> 00:20:20.535
and what comes through.

396
00:20:20.535 --> 00:20:23.436
It takes on a deeper meaning.

397
00:20:26.439 --> 00:20:30.823
As we went around the country, essentially

398
00:20:30.823 --> 00:20:33.222
to research this, what we did is,

399
00:20:33.222 --> 00:20:38.222
we bought a motorhome and the Edgar Cayce readings

400
00:20:40.134 --> 00:20:43.089
were for the first time, put on a computer database.

401
00:20:43.089 --> 00:20:45.776
Now, you can even get them online.

402
00:20:45.776 --> 00:20:49.659
At that time it was a big hard drive on a computer,

403
00:20:49.659 --> 00:20:51.611
because they had just been transcribed.

404
00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:55.813
But we, essentially outfitted this motor home

405
00:20:55.813 --> 00:20:58.341
with file cabinets, with a computer,

406
00:20:58.341 --> 00:21:02.260
and essentially took off across the country.

407
00:21:04.122 --> 00:21:07.883
Visiting all the places that Edgar Cayce lived and worked.

408
00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:11.240
Looking for people who'd had readings.

409
00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.069
Because readings were given as late

410
00:21:15.069 --> 00:21:16.597
as the mid to late forties.

411
00:21:16.597 --> 00:21:18.356
<v Regina>1945.</v>

412
00:21:18.356 --> 00:21:21.290
<v ->We could and we did find a number of people</v>

413
00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:24.462
who'd had readings, but what we found ...

414
00:21:25.887 --> 00:21:29.605
We were talking about Selma, Alabama in particular.

415
00:21:30.187 --> 00:21:34.458
We know of course, Edgar Cayce was a very devout Christian.

416
00:21:34.965 --> 00:21:39.402
Wherever he lived, he was very active in the church.

417
00:21:39.402 --> 00:21:43.903
When we were researching the book, we invariably

418
00:21:43.903 --> 00:21:48.252
dropped anchor first at the First Christian Church.

419
00:21:48.252 --> 00:21:50.220
Wherever we happened to be.

420
00:21:51.683 --> 00:21:54.087
In many of these churches, most of

421
00:21:54.087 --> 00:21:57.480
the ones we visited, actually, where Edgar Cayce attended,

422
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.242
he was a church deacon, he was the church secretary,

423
00:22:00.242 --> 00:22:03.298
he was on the board, he was very active.

424
00:22:04.168 --> 00:22:06.162
You could actually go into the church records

425
00:22:06.162 --> 00:22:11.162
and see Edgar Cayce's own handwriting,

426
00:22:11.548 --> 00:22:15.729
what his day was about, what he was up to in the church.

427
00:22:15.729 --> 00:22:20.729
What I'm getting at is that in say,

428
00:22:21.094 --> 00:22:23.270
Selma, Alabama, in particular,

429
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:25.894
as you went through these records,

430
00:22:25.894 --> 00:22:30.894
knowing the names that went with those numbers.

431
00:22:32.518 --> 00:22:36.528
One could say, "Oh, isn't this interesting?"

432
00:22:36.528 --> 00:22:39.893
"Lamar Jones was another deacon here."

433
00:22:40.411 --> 00:22:43.674
You look at this date and you see,

434
00:22:43.674 --> 00:22:47.748
well, look who else was at this church meeting.

435
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:53.864
What you had developing are these groups.

436
00:22:56.881 --> 00:22:59.190
In Selma, Alabama, in particular.

437
00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.605
For example, the Butler family.

438
00:23:03.542 --> 00:23:05.622
Edgar would give a reading for

439
00:23:05.622 --> 00:23:07.371
one member of the Butler family

440
00:23:07.371 --> 00:23:12.371
and they were concerned about their Aunt Mary,

441
00:23:12.565 --> 00:23:14.773
who was in a mental asylum.

442
00:23:14.773 --> 00:23:17.327
So, a reading was given on her.

443
00:23:17.378 --> 00:23:19.820
Then a reading was given on the brother.

444
00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.577
Then a reading was given on the uncle.

445
00:23:23.095 --> 00:23:25.345
What you have happening

446
00:23:25.345 --> 00:23:27.590
is almost like a family tree.

447
00:23:30.315 --> 00:23:33.793
Actually, we had a family tree like this

448
00:23:33.793 --> 00:23:37.552
on the wall of our motorhome as we were researching.

449
00:23:39.179 --> 00:23:41.312
It goes up here and Edgar Cayce gives

450
00:23:41.312 --> 00:23:44.075
this reading for one family member,

451
00:23:44.075 --> 00:23:48.954
and almost invariably, you get 4 or 5 others.

452
00:23:50.485 --> 00:23:54.389
You build these almost genealogical trees.

453
00:23:55.879 --> 00:24:00.780
Instead of viewing the work as these famous people,

454
00:24:01.479 --> 00:24:06.284
you start looking at it in a greater context.

455
00:24:08.561 --> 00:24:13.270
You almost have a river, a genealogical river.

456
00:24:15.068 --> 00:24:16.828
You start seeing that that's what

457
00:24:16.828 --> 00:24:20.053
the Cayce work was all about.

458
00:24:20.891 --> 00:24:25.147
Many people make a profound mistake,

459
00:24:25.147 --> 00:24:30.107
and it's a natural mistake of thinking about Cayce's work.

460
00:24:30.107 --> 00:24:35.063
Or Edgar Cayce's work, that this is somehow or another

461
00:24:36.786 --> 00:24:40.727
his doing or he alone doing.

462
00:24:40.947 --> 00:24:44.200
When, in reality, it's a much richer

463
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.144
and more complex kind of thing.

464
00:24:46.144 --> 00:24:49.100
Edgar Cayce didn't do what he did alone.

465
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.516
He didn't.

466
00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.428
He needed someone to guide him into trance.

467
00:24:55.428 --> 00:24:57.950
Invariably, his wife Gertrude.

468
00:24:58.094 --> 00:25:01.508
He needed someone to transcribe,

469
00:25:01.508 --> 00:25:04.249
take down what he was saying.

470
00:25:04.249 --> 00:25:07.240
Invariably his secretary, Gladys Davis.

471
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:10.703
He needed most of all, someone who

472
00:25:10.703 --> 00:25:15.703
was in desperate need, genuine need of help.

473
00:25:16.723 --> 00:25:19.225
Willing to come to him.

474
00:25:19.286 --> 00:25:21.670
Willing to come to that team.

475
00:25:22.679 --> 00:25:24.908
So, it was not one man's work.

476
00:25:24.908 --> 00:25:26.833
It was a collective work.

477
00:25:27.927 --> 00:25:32.289
I think that's very important to understanding

478
00:25:32.289 --> 00:25:37.289
why today we have an entire library of readings,

479
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:42.750
which don't exist for many, many psychically gifted people.

480
00:25:47.159 --> 00:25:50.941
Peter Hurkos, a very gifted Dutch psychic.

481
00:25:51.406 --> 00:25:54.770
Eileen Garrett, the Irish psychic.

482
00:25:57.582 --> 00:26:00.397
The fruition of their work didn't come together

483
00:26:00.397 --> 00:26:04.482
as it has in Cayce, and I think with Cayce

484
00:26:04.482 --> 00:26:07.661
it was because it was a collective work.

485
00:26:07.661 --> 00:26:09.302
<v Regina>Right.</v>

486
00:26:10.792 --> 00:26:11.597
<v ->I don't know.</v>

487
00:26:11.597 --> 00:26:13.528
<v Regina>Well in addition to that, what I'm wondering is</v>

488
00:26:13.528 --> 00:26:18.528
you saw these family trees, so to speak, developing.

489
00:26:19.289 --> 00:26:24.025
Did you see an interconnectedness, regarding

490
00:26:24.025 --> 00:26:26.885
the maladies and the source of the maladies?

491
00:26:26.885 --> 00:26:30.437
For example, could you see familial portraits

492
00:26:30.437 --> 00:26:34.757
of illness that maybe stemmed from the spiritual

493
00:26:34.757 --> 00:26:38.249
through to the mental or emotional and into the physical?

494
00:26:38.586 --> 00:26:40.907
Did those kinds of patterns emerge?

495
00:26:42.715 --> 00:26:44.064
Yes.

496
00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:46.832
It's really one of the things that is

497
00:26:46.832 --> 00:26:51.282
so exciting about studying Edgar Cayce today.

498
00:26:51.282 --> 00:26:53.434
As opposed to the 1940's.

499
00:26:53.899 --> 00:26:55.942
He died in 1946.

500
00:26:57.804 --> 00:27:01.569
We have an opportunity, and people are doing it.

501
00:27:01.569 --> 00:27:03.585
It's very exciting to see.

502
00:27:03.585 --> 00:27:07.926
To study these treatments and who got them,

503
00:27:07.926 --> 00:27:12.926
when and how, in a far more comprehensive way.

504
00:27:14.155 --> 00:27:17.216
To be able, in Cayce's lifetime,

505
00:27:17.216 --> 00:27:20.719
say you were suffering psoriasis.

506
00:27:22.208 --> 00:27:27.208
We all know, psoriasis has been, and even today,

507
00:27:27.505 --> 00:27:30.567
most people consider ... it's a skin condition.

508
00:27:31.661 --> 00:27:33.199
When Edgar Cayce first started

509
00:27:33.199 --> 00:27:36.730
giving his readings on psoriasis,

510
00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.674
he said, "No, it's not a skin condition."

511
00:27:39.674 --> 00:27:41.557
It's a result of the thinning of the

512
00:27:41.557 --> 00:27:44.255
walls of the intestines and the colon

513
00:27:44.255 --> 00:27:46.485
and toxins are leeching out.

514
00:27:46.485 --> 00:27:48.246
<v Regina>Kinda like leaky gut.</v>

515
00:27:48.246 --> 00:27:49.387
<v ->Coming through the system</v>

516
00:27:49.387 --> 00:27:50.731
and it's escaping through the skin.

517
00:27:50.731 --> 00:27:52.094
Elimination.

518
00:27:52.724 --> 00:27:55.936
This is what's causing, and to treat it,

519
00:27:55.936 --> 00:28:00.026
one has to change one's diet.

520
00:28:04.159 --> 00:28:07.690
When Cayce started giving those readings in 1921,

521
00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:10.098
it was dismissed as absurd.

522
00:28:10.868 --> 00:28:15.042
Today, that's state of the art

523
00:28:15.042 --> 00:28:19.143
psoriasis treatment at Johns Hopkins.

524
00:28:20.386 --> 00:28:21.773
Cayce's on the map.

525
00:28:21.773 --> 00:28:26.773
Getting, in 1922, you'd have to go to Edgar Cayce.

526
00:28:26.862 --> 00:28:29.091
Today, of course, you can go online

527
00:28:29.091 --> 00:28:31.297
and you can access this.

528
00:28:31.297 --> 00:28:34.019
Today you can go online and you can see

529
00:28:34.019 --> 00:28:37.037
a variety of psoriasis readings and you can

530
00:28:37.037 --> 00:28:38.275
get into the science of it.

531
00:28:38.275 --> 00:28:41.323
Just very exciting time, today.

532
00:28:43.579 --> 00:28:48.579
In the having access to all of those readings,

533
00:28:50.642 --> 00:28:55.642
gives you almost an exponential amount more information.

534
00:28:57.175 --> 00:29:01.192
For example, one can see ...

535
00:29:05.006 --> 00:29:06.606
One can do a search of these readings

536
00:29:06.606 --> 00:29:09.661
and see how the treatments changed.

537
00:29:10.595 --> 00:29:13.518
In looking at how the treatments changed, you wonder,

538
00:29:13.518 --> 00:29:16.487
"Why did this treatment say for breast cancer?"

539
00:29:17.773 --> 00:29:19.346
"Why all of a sudden?"

540
00:29:20.674 --> 00:29:24.717
In these early readings, Cayce is suggesting

541
00:29:24.717 --> 00:29:29.717
the source is recommending a type of rabbit skin.

542
00:29:29.838 --> 00:29:33.251
You have to grow a particular kind of rabbit.

543
00:29:33.251 --> 00:29:36.409
You have to skin it, and you have to apply

544
00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:40.466
that skin to your breast.

545
00:29:40.792 --> 00:29:42.669
Why is this changing?

546
00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:45.420
Well, it's because another product

547
00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.198
is actually introduced on the market.

548
00:29:47.198 --> 00:29:49.310
All of a sudden.

549
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:50.570
<v Regina>You would expect to see that</v>

550
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.149
over that number of years.

551
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:54.122
<v ->That's what happens.</v>

552
00:29:55.182 --> 00:29:58.163
Sometimes, it's absolutely quite remarkable,

553
00:29:58.163 --> 00:30:01.128
because a product will have just been introduced

554
00:30:01.128 --> 00:30:04.968
on the market within days of that reading.

555
00:30:04.968 --> 00:30:06.980
All of a sudden, everything changes.

556
00:30:07.498 --> 00:30:10.132
It's exciting, not only to see that,

557
00:30:10.132 --> 00:30:15.132
but another aspect of this

558
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:20.220
is when Cayce gave help, in a trance reading.

559
00:30:22.019 --> 00:30:26.115
He was giving help to you in particular

560
00:30:26.115 --> 00:30:29.032
at this moment, at this time.

561
00:30:30.403 --> 00:30:35.012
If you don't have access, say to the Mayo brothers' clinic.

562
00:30:35.012 --> 00:30:39.001
If you can't afford that, say you're the wife

563
00:30:39.001 --> 00:30:43.065
of a tombstone cutter, and you're not gonna

564
00:30:43.065 --> 00:30:46.062
be able to get to the Mayo brothers' clinic

565
00:30:46.062 --> 00:30:49.169
and can afford that, a treatment's given to you

566
00:30:49.169 --> 00:30:51.931
that you can do yourself.

567
00:30:51.931 --> 00:30:53.410
<v Regina>Right.</v>

568
00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:57.802
<v ->Who or whatever's coming through this man</v>

569
00:30:57.802 --> 00:31:02.794
seems to know you in particular,

570
00:31:02.794 --> 00:31:05.966
and what you're capable of doing.

571
00:31:06.207 --> 00:31:08.805
It's frightening, scary ...

572
00:31:09.323 --> 00:31:10.666
<v Regina>It's awesome.</v>

573
00:31:10.666 --> 00:31:12.085
Awe-inspiring.

574
00:31:12.085 --> 00:31:13.920
And when you were saying earlier

575
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.607
part of the success has been that this was a collective.

576
00:31:16.607 --> 00:31:21.607
It had his wife and also Gladys and others.

577
00:31:22.648 --> 00:31:24.856
Also you just mentioned source,

578
00:31:24.856 --> 00:31:26.744
that's probably the greatest collaboration.

579
00:31:26.744 --> 00:31:30.893
Was between he and whatever source the information was.

580
00:31:30.893 --> 00:31:32.611
<v ->I think it was the team.</v>

581
00:31:32.611 --> 00:31:34.402
<v Regina>That was flowing through him.</v>

582
00:31:34.402 --> 00:31:35.746
<v ->I think it as a connection.</v>

583
00:31:35.746 --> 00:31:36.888
'Cause Cayce, in his waking state,

584
00:31:36.888 --> 00:31:40.535
didn't remember anything he said in trance.

585
00:31:40.535 --> 00:31:43.163
One has to ask, well why is that?

586
00:31:43.163 --> 00:31:44.838
<v Regina>Well, and when you look at some of the</v>

587
00:31:44.838 --> 00:31:47.622
very early parts of his life that you've written about.

588
00:31:47.622 --> 00:31:50.128
Where, in what was it, his second time

589
00:31:50.128 --> 00:31:51.643
under hypnosis, someone wanted

590
00:31:51.643 --> 00:31:54.747
to make a parlor joke out of him and said,

591
00:31:54.747 --> 00:31:57.617
"Well, Edgar, why don't you go play the piano."

592
00:31:57.617 --> 00:31:59.025
Course he didn't have a piano,

593
00:31:59.025 --> 00:32:00.913
and didn't know how to play the piano.

594
00:32:00.913 --> 00:32:02.537
Talk about what happened.

595
00:32:02.537 --> 00:32:06.537
<v ->We know Edgar Cayce was a very strange child.</v>

596
00:32:06.537 --> 00:32:07.900
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

597
00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.261
Lots of trauma and accidents.

598
00:32:09.261 --> 00:32:11.490
Why don't you start with the spike into the brain.

599
00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:12.952
I mean, some people think that may have

600
00:32:12.952 --> 00:32:14.366
had something to do with it.

601
00:32:16.172 --> 00:32:21.172
<v ->There's a story and it's fairly well-documented</v>

602
00:32:21.729 --> 00:32:24.300
that when Edgar Cayce was in diapers,

603
00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:27.649
he was sat on a fence post and he rolled,

604
00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:29.782
essentially rolled off the fence post,

605
00:32:29.782 --> 00:32:33.035
onto a nail that was driven into a piece of wood.

606
00:32:33.035 --> 00:32:36.192
They had to pull it out of his cranium.

607
00:32:36.192 --> 00:32:41.192
It's interesting to note, in that number of psychics,

608
00:32:42.997 --> 00:32:46.528
suffered some kind of brain trauma

609
00:32:46.528 --> 00:32:49.333
as adolescents, and even older.

610
00:32:49.333 --> 00:32:53.556
Peter Hurkos, for example, the Dutch psychic,

611
00:32:53.556 --> 00:32:57.503
had no psychic ability, per se.

612
00:32:57.503 --> 00:33:01.567
Until the Nazis invaded Holland and

613
00:33:01.567 --> 00:33:05.310
he was consigned as a, painting army barracks.

614
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:08.372
He was up on a ladder and he fell two floors

615
00:33:08.372 --> 00:33:13.372
down onto his head and had a steel plate put in his head.

616
00:33:14.035 --> 00:33:16.990
As soon as that steel plate was in,

617
00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:20.584
he was suddenly very gifted, much like Edgar Cayce.

618
00:33:20.584 --> 00:33:22.536
Speaking specifics.

619
00:33:22.536 --> 00:33:23.603
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

620
00:33:23.603 --> 00:33:25.576
<v ->Anyway, there's a long history.</v>

621
00:33:25.576 --> 00:33:30.576
To say that this a result of a spike in the brain.

622
00:33:31.474 --> 00:33:32.839
<v Regina>Who knows, it could have just opened</v>

623
00:33:32.839 --> 00:33:36.764
some aspect of an electrical function within his brain.

624
00:33:36.764 --> 00:33:38.652
Or not, but the point is ...

625
00:33:38.652 --> 00:33:43.036
<v ->We know Edgar Cayce had gifts as a child.</v>

626
00:33:43.036 --> 00:33:45.265
Even Sidney Kirkpatrick, who was very

627
00:33:45.265 --> 00:33:50.265
skeptical going into it, I was determined to ...

628
00:33:50.833 --> 00:33:54.225
These are the kind of stories that are easily embellished.

629
00:33:54.225 --> 00:33:57.659
Childhood stories, but time and time again,

630
00:33:57.659 --> 00:34:00.336
I actually kept finding documentation.

631
00:34:00.336 --> 00:34:03.419
The story that's often told about Edgar Cayce

632
00:34:03.419 --> 00:34:06.715
is how he could put his head, and lay his head

633
00:34:06.715 --> 00:34:09.573
down on a book and he would know

634
00:34:09.573 --> 00:34:13.061
the entire contents verbatim.

635
00:34:13.061 --> 00:34:15.706
You can say well, this is clearly

636
00:34:15.706 --> 00:34:17.999
an embroidered story.

637
00:34:17.999 --> 00:34:22.999
However, we were able to find an actual

638
00:34:23.737 --> 00:34:27.823
newspaper article talking about a 10 year old

639
00:34:27.823 --> 00:34:31.236
Edgar Cayce giving a presentation

640
00:34:31.236 --> 00:34:36.089
in front of Town Hall, reciting a 250 page,

641
00:34:36.089 --> 00:34:37.763
well it's probably not that long.

642
00:34:37.763 --> 00:34:42.712
But it was witnessed by the entire ...

643
00:34:43.722 --> 00:34:45.302
<v Regina>Let's go back to the piano incident.</v>

644
00:34:45.302 --> 00:34:48.199
So they're trying to do a little parlor game with him,

645
00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.802
make a fool of him, 'cause he was easy to hypnotize.

646
00:34:50.802 --> 00:34:52.498
What actually ended up happening?

647
00:34:52.498 --> 00:34:55.559
<v ->Well, he actually started playing the piano.</v>

648
00:34:55.559 --> 00:35:00.455
You have readings where he suddenly speaking in Italian.

649
00:35:02.175 --> 00:35:05.602
These are not, again, what's just so compelling

650
00:35:05.602 --> 00:35:09.548
about this is that they're documented, truly documented.

651
00:35:10.218 --> 00:35:12.682
Edgar Cayce was surrounded by physicians

652
00:35:12.682 --> 00:35:14.911
at a very early point in his career,

653
00:35:14.911 --> 00:35:19.785
so you have many, very well-respected physicians,

654
00:35:19.785 --> 00:35:21.577
witnessing these readings.

655
00:35:21.577 --> 00:35:25.976
Secretaries transcribing the readings.

656
00:35:28.212 --> 00:35:33.212
As unbelievable as it may seem, it stands up.

657
00:35:33.929 --> 00:35:35.273
<v Regina>Everyone was trying to test him</v>

658
00:35:35.273 --> 00:35:36.382
to see if this was for real,

659
00:35:36.382 --> 00:35:38.174
because he was so extraordinary.

660
00:35:38.174 --> 00:35:40.542
Thank God there's all this documentation.

661
00:35:40.542 --> 00:35:43.283
<v ->Dean of Harvard Medical School, Hugo Münsterberg,</v>

662
00:35:43.283 --> 00:35:47.762
literally came from Cambridge, Massachusetts,

663
00:35:47.762 --> 00:35:51.336
to Beverly, Kentucky to check this man out.

664
00:35:51.336 --> 00:35:56.336
To test him and ultimately, he could not find fraud.

665
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:03.409
He said, "I don't know how this is happening, or why."

666
00:36:03.409 --> 00:36:07.729
But he didn't deny that this is what he found

667
00:36:07.729 --> 00:36:09.329
and this is what he saw.

668
00:36:09.329 --> 00:36:11.260
It's very compelling.

669
00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:15.462
The work, Edgar Cayce was often asked,

670
00:36:15.462 --> 00:36:17.713
"What is the purpose of the work?"

671
00:36:17.713 --> 00:36:21.776
And in trance, one of the main themes

672
00:36:21.776 --> 00:36:23.803
that'd come through is Edgar Cayce

673
00:36:23.803 --> 00:36:28.735
is to prove the existence of the other dimension.

674
00:36:29.306 --> 00:36:31.600
Prove the truth of psychic phenomena.

675
00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.159
Which he certainly succeeded in doing.

676
00:36:34.159 --> 00:36:36.847
<v Regina>And the legacy that has been left for all of us.</v>

677
00:36:36.847 --> 00:36:39.450
In terms of, not only understanding body,

678
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.999
but also mind and spirit and soul,

679
00:36:41.999 --> 00:36:44.975
is really incredible.

680
00:36:44.975 --> 00:36:46.969
On that other dimensional aspect of it,

681
00:36:46.969 --> 00:36:48.921
one of the things I found interesting too,

682
00:36:48.921 --> 00:36:51.033
is that over a period of time,

683
00:36:51.033 --> 00:36:53.678
everyone was accustomed to having their letters answered.

684
00:36:53.678 --> 00:36:57.486
He had a two-year long wait list finally, as time went on.

685
00:36:57.486 --> 00:37:00.323
But he would start doing channellings,

686
00:37:00.323 --> 00:37:03.800
you almost call them, the other being readings,

687
00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.381
which were answering questions from

688
00:37:06.381 --> 00:37:08.003
letters that were still in transit.

689
00:37:08.003 --> 00:37:10.093
Still on the boat.

690
00:37:10.093 --> 00:37:12.952
Had not arrived to his residence yet.

691
00:37:12.952 --> 00:37:17.058
He was, obviously, whatever was working through him,

692
00:37:17.058 --> 00:37:19.311
moved beyond time and space.

693
00:37:19.311 --> 00:37:22.270
Whether it was future, past, or present had no ...

694
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:23.966
It seemed to be very little difference

695
00:37:23.966 --> 00:37:26.285
in terms of his readings.

696
00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:33.520
<v ->To add to that, Edgar Cayce was popular</v>

697
00:37:34.515 --> 00:37:37.757
in the later years of his own lifetime.

698
00:37:37.757 --> 00:37:42.056
With the publication of There is a River.

699
00:37:42.056 --> 00:37:46.209
Then, saw a great resurgence in the 1960's.

700
00:37:50.759 --> 00:37:53.811
Meditation, holistic health.

701
00:37:53.811 --> 00:37:57.619
Edgar Cayce is undergoing another resurgence right now.

702
00:37:57.619 --> 00:38:01.256
Since around, it started around 2000

703
00:38:01.256 --> 00:38:02.813
and it has been climbing.

704
00:38:02.813 --> 00:38:05.853
The difference is that people are

705
00:38:05.853 --> 00:38:08.231
not only looking at the health treatments

706
00:38:08.231 --> 00:38:13.174
in a much more specific way, they're looking at inventions.

707
00:38:13.174 --> 00:38:15.094
Science, electronics.

708
00:38:15.094 --> 00:38:16.157
<v Regina>That's what I wanted to talk</v>

709
00:38:16.157 --> 00:38:17.341
to you about a little bit more.

710
00:38:17.341 --> 00:38:21.031
He was consulting with Tesla and Edison.

711
00:38:21.031 --> 00:38:23.794
<v ->And many other scientists.</v>

712
00:38:23.794 --> 00:38:25.884
Engineers.

713
00:38:25.884 --> 00:38:28.625
In his lifetime, there was an IBM engineer

714
00:38:28.625 --> 00:38:30.438
who was getting readings.

715
00:38:30.438 --> 00:38:32.742
These readings are absolutely fascinating.

716
00:38:32.742 --> 00:38:36.827
On alternative energy, on flight, on anti-gravity.

717
00:38:36.827 --> 00:38:38.353
Physics.

718
00:38:38.353 --> 00:38:41.307
Subjects which were not totally ignored

719
00:38:41.307 --> 00:38:44.880
in the 1960's, but they weren't studied.

720
00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.667
In a way that today, they're being studied.

721
00:38:48.667 --> 00:38:53.667
I'm just very excited about studying Cayce now.

722
00:38:55.418 --> 00:38:58.469
With so much, with a general population

723
00:38:58.469 --> 00:39:00.090
who's suddenly woken up and say,

724
00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:04.474
"Oh my God, what I eat, the quality of the food I eat."

725
00:39:04.474 --> 00:39:06.959
"What I put into my body."

726
00:39:06.959 --> 00:39:10.116
Pharmaceuticals, for example.

727
00:39:10.116 --> 00:39:13.369
How long has it taken before people begin

728
00:39:13.369 --> 00:39:15.876
to understand that the pharmaceutical,

729
00:39:15.876 --> 00:39:18.414
the prescriptions they're taking may not

730
00:39:18.414 --> 00:39:23.150
be that miracle relief that they've been looking for.

731
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:25.912
Oh, by the way, come along with some

732
00:39:25.912 --> 00:39:27.214
pretty horrible side effects.

733
00:39:27.214 --> 00:39:28.344
<v Regina>Right.</v>

734
00:39:28.344 --> 00:39:30.488
<v ->People are waking up.</v>

735
00:39:30.488 --> 00:39:31.992
<v Regina>They wanna go back to the basics.</v>

736
00:39:31.992 --> 00:39:36.130
<v ->Of course, this is at the heart, at the root</v>

737
00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:39.053
of the Cayce work, and the material's there.

738
00:39:39.053 --> 00:39:40.375
You just gotta look.

739
00:39:40.375 --> 00:39:41.581
<v Regina>Now, when you were looking through there,</v>

740
00:39:41.581 --> 00:39:45.548
did you happen to see any readings that had to do,

741
00:39:45.548 --> 00:39:47.415
personally see any readings that had to do

742
00:39:47.415 --> 00:39:50.657
with anti-gravity and some of these future technologies?

743
00:39:50.657 --> 00:39:52.076
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

744
00:39:52.076 --> 00:39:54.360
It's there.

745
00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:59.360
We have what might be termed a perpetual motion machine.

746
00:40:01.977 --> 00:40:06.243
Which in truth is not a perpetual motion machine,

747
00:40:06.243 --> 00:40:09.774
but it could operate much like that.

748
00:40:09.774 --> 00:40:14.094
It has to do with a kind of polarity motor

749
00:40:14.094 --> 00:40:18.648
and these are blueprints given in the Edgar Cayce readings.

750
00:40:18.648 --> 00:40:22.541
About a giant drum, how the drum has to be built.

751
00:40:22.541 --> 00:40:24.983
The actual specifications.

752
00:40:24.983 --> 00:40:28.023
The gases that have to be pumped inside.

753
00:40:28.023 --> 00:40:33.023
The idea is you immerse this in a tub of water

754
00:40:33.506 --> 00:40:36.311
while you're building it, now don't ask me why

755
00:40:36.311 --> 00:40:39.681
you've gotta be building it in water.

756
00:40:39.681 --> 00:40:42.465
But then, you pull it up and you ...

757
00:40:42.465 --> 00:40:45.110
The idea being is you start turning it,

758
00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:47.531
and once you get it turning and

759
00:40:47.531 --> 00:40:52.128
on the right axis, according to Cayce

760
00:40:52.128 --> 00:40:54.870
this drum will turn forever.

761
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:57.003
Until you stop it.

762
00:40:57.003 --> 00:40:59.296
<v Regina>Is anyone developing that right now?</v>

763
00:40:59.296 --> 00:41:02.549
<v ->Three scientists have been looking at it.</v>

764
00:41:02.549 --> 00:41:07.549
There's a huge wealth of material that is now accessible.

765
00:41:11.353 --> 00:41:15.950
Perhaps for the first time since Edgar Cayce,

766
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:17.571
first time in history.

767
00:41:17.571 --> 00:41:22.562
You have enough of a mainstream scientists,

768
00:41:22.562 --> 00:41:25.613
physicians, who were willing to look and study this.

769
00:41:25.613 --> 00:41:30.343
Because they're seeing its value.

770
00:41:30.765 --> 00:41:34.359
Whether you buy in or not, of how.

771
00:41:34.359 --> 00:41:36.055
<v Regina>The information came.</v>

772
00:41:36.055 --> 00:41:37.122
<v ->Came through.</v>

773
00:41:37.122 --> 00:41:40.375
It's there and it shows how effective it actually is.

774
00:41:40.375 --> 00:41:44.297
<v Regina>Are those ... if a person's a member of A.R.E.</v>

775
00:41:45.582 --> 00:41:47.204
Can they have access to these files?

776
00:41:47.204 --> 00:41:48.505
<v ->Absolutely, online.</v>

777
00:41:48.505 --> 00:41:50.734
<v Regina>They can read all of these online?</v>

778
00:41:50.734 --> 00:41:53.123
<v ->Membership's like thirty, forty dollars.</v>

779
00:41:53.123 --> 00:41:53.934
It's nothing.

780
00:41:53.934 --> 00:41:55.193
<v Regina>It's very inexpensive.</v>

781
00:41:55.193 --> 00:41:56.888
<v ->You can actually buy the readings</v>

782
00:41:56.888 --> 00:42:01.498
on a CD-ROM, or a DVD-ROM, DV drive.

783
00:42:01.498 --> 00:42:03.610
<v Regina>Are they categorized by subjects?</v>

784
00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:04.869
<v ->The material is out there.</v>

785
00:42:04.869 --> 00:42:06.373
<v Regina>Are they categorized by subjects?</v>

786
00:42:06.373 --> 00:42:07.397
<v ->Yes.</v>

787
00:42:07.397 --> 00:42:09.156
<v Regina>So it could be alternative energy, for example.</v>

788
00:42:09.156 --> 00:42:12.154
<v ->Yes, I mean it's not quite as easy</v>

789
00:42:12.154 --> 00:42:14.244
as typing in alternative energy and you're gonna

790
00:42:14.244 --> 00:42:16.452
get these blueprints.

791
00:42:16.452 --> 00:42:18.449
It's not that way.

792
00:42:18.449 --> 00:42:21.542
Don't fool yourself when they refer

793
00:42:21.542 --> 00:42:23.676
to the Cayce work, it is work.

794
00:42:23.676 --> 00:42:25.664
It is work.

795
00:42:26.673 --> 00:42:31.622
I don't want to put you off.

796
00:42:32.375 --> 00:42:35.457
It's not an easy, slam-dunk kind of thing.

797
00:42:35.457 --> 00:42:37.548
You have to put some energy into it

798
00:42:37.548 --> 00:42:41.356
to understand some of the language coming through.

799
00:42:41.356 --> 00:42:42.891
Like in the physics readings.

800
00:42:42.891 --> 00:42:47.891
There were no terms in 1918, 1919,

801
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:52.501
when Cayce was giving these for what

802
00:42:52.501 --> 00:42:55.104
the source was trying to convey.

803
00:42:55.104 --> 00:43:00.104
There were no language, had not been developed for this.

804
00:43:02.048 --> 00:43:04.949
It's difficult in some respects.

805
00:43:04.949 --> 00:43:06.730
You have to study it, you have to use it.

806
00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:08.191
But the material is there,

807
00:43:08.191 --> 00:43:10.809
just like in the medical readings.

808
00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.607
<v Regina>One quote I loved,</v>

809
00:43:12.607 --> 00:43:14.345
as I was digging through there.

810
00:43:14.345 --> 00:43:16.276
When he was talking about electricity,

811
00:43:16.276 --> 00:43:19.433
and talking about the human being, and energy.

812
00:43:20.153 --> 00:43:21.723
And the hierarchy of how the

813
00:43:21.723 --> 00:43:25.208
human functions is, electricity is life.

814
00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.112
That's huge.

815
00:43:27.112 --> 00:43:29.022
Because when we're looking at future technologies.

816
00:43:29.022 --> 00:43:32.669
<v ->You got it, you're really onto ...</v>

817
00:43:32.669 --> 00:43:35.731
I'm so glad you picked up on that because

818
00:43:35.731 --> 00:43:40.731
as you get more deeper into this work.

819
00:43:41.407 --> 00:43:45.310
As you start really studying the readings.

820
00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:47.582
One of the wonderful aspects is that

821
00:43:47.582 --> 00:43:49.907
what may interest you at first about Edgar Cayce;

822
00:43:49.907 --> 00:43:52.296
you may be interested in Atlantis.

823
00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:54.589
Which of course, is covered a great deal.

824
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:56.381
So you come into it this way.

825
00:43:56.381 --> 00:44:01.381
Or your husband has male-pattern baldness

826
00:44:02.695 --> 00:44:07.695
or you've got breast cancer, or psoriasis.

827
00:44:07.922 --> 00:44:10.055
Or you're interested in reincarnation.

828
00:44:10.055 --> 00:44:13.009
You come at this Cayce work through

829
00:44:13.009 --> 00:44:16.465
these different avenues, but as you

830
00:44:16.465 --> 00:44:21.465
get into it, you start realizing that

831
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:25.147
Atlantis and these medical readings

832
00:44:25.147 --> 00:44:29.653
share a lot of the same principles.

833
00:44:31.024 --> 00:44:33.253
Then you get into it a little deeper.

834
00:44:33.253 --> 00:44:36.266
Let's say you're waist high into this stuff.

835
00:44:36.592 --> 00:44:41.264
You start realizing, not only they share principles,

836
00:44:41.264 --> 00:44:44.741
but when you start talking about the physics readings.

837
00:44:44.741 --> 00:44:46.074
And you start talking about

838
00:44:46.074 --> 00:44:48.804
the vibrational nature of everything.

839
00:44:48.804 --> 00:44:50.042
Of medicine.

840
00:44:50.042 --> 00:44:54.473
And say, "Why is it important?"

841
00:44:56.281 --> 00:45:00.345
This woman is asking for medical help

842
00:45:00.345 --> 00:45:05.345
and she's told to carry a piece of azurite,

843
00:45:05.627 --> 00:45:10.288
which is a mineral, with them at all times.

844
00:45:10.288 --> 00:45:13.979
How can that be medically related?

845
00:45:13.979 --> 00:45:16.347
You start realizing that it is a whole.

846
00:45:16.347 --> 00:45:21.347
And that to really understand the physics readings,

847
00:45:22.576 --> 00:45:25.541
you're gonna have to go in the medical readings,

848
00:45:25.541 --> 00:45:27.056
then you're gonna have to go ...

849
00:45:27.056 --> 00:45:30.842
You start realizing that they really are

850
00:45:30.842 --> 00:45:32.527
all one and the same.

851
00:45:32.527 --> 00:45:33.647
That's an exciting moment.

852
00:45:33.647 --> 00:45:37.223
But it's not a point that's easily reached.

853
00:45:37.483 --> 00:45:38.806
<v Regina>Well, I can't imagine</v>

854
00:45:38.806 --> 00:45:40.917
how this would not have changed your life.

855
00:45:40.917 --> 00:45:44.363
You continue on, you write for the magazine

856
00:45:44.363 --> 00:45:46.752
on a regular basis.

857
00:45:46.752 --> 00:45:48.608
<v ->Just recently, I've just started.</v>

858
00:45:48.608 --> 00:45:51.136
They asked for a column, so I've been writing a column.

859
00:45:51.136 --> 00:45:52.575
It's a fun change.

860
00:45:52.575 --> 00:45:54.602
<v Regina>And tomorrow you're giving a lecture,</v>

861
00:45:54.602 --> 00:45:57.876
which I'll be happy to be able to sit in on.

862
00:45:57.876 --> 00:45:58.890
<v ->Good, okay.</v>

863
00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:01.055
<v Regina>And then you also do with the soul family, right?</v>

864
00:46:01.055 --> 00:46:03.999
That'll be very interesting, because

865
00:46:03.999 --> 00:46:07.209
that's what piques my interest.

866
00:46:07.209 --> 00:46:10.846
Looking at characters throughout history.

867
00:46:10.846 --> 00:46:13.331
<v ->Also, one of the things I can touch on,</v>

868
00:46:13.331 --> 00:46:16.856
which I personally like, is ...

869
00:46:17.235 --> 00:46:18.792
We were talking about Edgar Cayce being

870
00:46:18.792 --> 00:46:20.552
a strange bird as a child.

871
00:46:20.552 --> 00:46:22.131
You know, he had imaginary playmates.

872
00:46:22.131 --> 00:46:23.626
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

873
00:46:23.626 --> 00:46:26.602
<v ->Many of us have had imaginary playmates.</v>

874
00:46:26.602 --> 00:46:28.534
I certainly did.

875
00:46:28.534 --> 00:46:31.019
With Edgar Cayce, those playmates

876
00:46:31.019 --> 00:46:33.291
had first and last names.

877
00:46:33.291 --> 00:46:34.731
They had families.

878
00:46:34.731 --> 00:46:36.192
They had very exotic histories.

879
00:46:36.192 --> 00:46:41.192
Which a farm child from the 1870's

880
00:46:42.421 --> 00:46:46.325
in rural Beverly, Kentucky should not

881
00:46:46.325 --> 00:46:49.664
have been talking about Persia, Egypt.

882
00:46:49.664 --> 00:46:52.113
<v Regina>(laughing) He has little friends from Egypt.</v>

883
00:46:52.113 --> 00:46:53.003
Yes.

884
00:46:53.003 --> 00:46:54.656
<v ->I'm gonna tell you about that,</v>

885
00:46:54.656 --> 00:46:59.656
because it's remarkable later on in Cayce's life.

886
00:47:00.992 --> 00:47:04.192
Long after the imaginary playmates have disappeared.

887
00:47:04.192 --> 00:47:09.192
Long after the schoolmates who taunted him

888
00:47:09.834 --> 00:47:13.279
as the freak, were out of his life.

889
00:47:13.279 --> 00:47:18.279
Years later, when he's living over here, in Virginia Beach.

890
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:21.492
Couple blocks, half a mile from here.

891
00:47:21.492 --> 00:47:25.812
One of the last readings he gave was to ask,

892
00:47:25.812 --> 00:47:27.998
"Who were those imaginary playmates?"

893
00:47:27.998 --> 00:47:30.985
He asked himself.

894
00:47:30.985 --> 00:47:34.291
One of the last requests that he had

895
00:47:34.291 --> 00:47:37.512
of the source, "Who were they?"

896
00:47:37.512 --> 00:47:39.554
"Were they real?"

897
00:47:42.877 --> 00:47:44.277
<v Regina>And?</v>

898
00:47:44.277 --> 00:47:45.876
Well, we'll just have to find out.

899
00:47:45.876 --> 00:47:48.244
<v ->You're gonna have to come hear me tomorrow.</v>

900
00:47:48.244 --> 00:47:51.263
It's really ... absolutely ...

901
00:47:51.263 --> 00:47:53.983
It opens up a whole other door.

902
00:47:53.983 --> 00:47:55.903
It's a type of lecture I like.

903
00:47:55.903 --> 00:47:58.741
I also like giving lectures on the

904
00:47:58.741 --> 00:48:00.777
odd and unusual in Cayce work.

905
00:48:00.777 --> 00:48:01.641
<v Regina>Yes.</v>

906
00:48:01.641 --> 00:48:03.454
<v ->Because these things interest me.</v>

907
00:48:03.454 --> 00:48:07.187
<v ->Well, just from what you've already done, I thank you.</v>

908
00:48:07.187 --> 00:48:09.790
I haven't gotten all the way through the book

909
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:12.062
because I didn't have time, but that's

910
00:48:12.062 --> 00:48:13.736
going to be my companion for a little while,

911
00:48:13.736 --> 00:48:16.755
to finish that book, I just love what you've done.

912
00:48:16.755 --> 00:48:18.941
Tomorrow, I'll get the answer to that story.

913
00:48:18.941 --> 00:48:20.072
Who those playmates are.

914
00:48:20.072 --> 00:48:22.274
And I might just share it with everybody.

915
00:48:23.858 --> 00:48:26.653
Thank you so much for your time.

916
00:48:26.653 --> 00:48:29.300
Like you say, you've incorporated all this into your life.

917
00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:33.385
You and your family you use the philosophies

918
00:48:33.385 --> 00:48:36.680
and the remedies, because it just makes sense and it works.

919
00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:37.881
<v ->Yeah</v>

920
00:48:38.538 --> 00:48:40.095
<v Regina>All righty, enough said.</v>

921
00:48:40.095 --> 00:48:41.215
Thank you so much, Sidney.

922
00:48:41.215 --> 00:48:42.670
<v ->Thank you.</v>

923
00:48:45.716 --> 00:48:47.199
<v ->While a devotee of Cayce's work</v>

924
00:48:47.199 --> 00:48:49.311
on a personal level and professional,

925
00:48:49.311 --> 00:48:51.732
Sidney has written several other intriguing books.

926
00:48:51.732 --> 00:48:54.612
His most recent being, "Hitler's Holy Relics."

927
00:48:54.612 --> 00:48:56.446
To connect with his blogs and work,

928
00:48:56.446 --> 00:48:57.961
