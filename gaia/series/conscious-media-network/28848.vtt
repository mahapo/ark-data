00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:03.406
<v ->We've all heard of the profiteering involved in war.</v>

2
00:00:03.406 --> 00:00:06.986
In short, war is good business for those in the power elite.

3
00:00:06.986 --> 00:00:09.006
The war in Irag is no exception.

4
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:11.286
Film producer, Robert Greenwald has pulled together

5
00:00:11.286 --> 00:00:13.906
a portrait of the degree to which this war

6
00:00:13.906 --> 00:00:15.546
has been conducted to profit those

7
00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:19.426
closest to those in power and the profits are staggering.

8
00:00:19.426 --> 00:00:22.226
Try the $45 per six-pack of coke

9
00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:24.486
the government pays the services contractor

10
00:00:24.486 --> 00:00:28.106
or the $100 to do a load of the soldiers skivvies

11
00:00:28.106 --> 00:00:30.386
and that's only small potatoes compared to the rest

12
00:00:30.386 --> 00:00:33.522
of what's detailed in the film "Iraq for Sale".

13
00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:38.372 line:15% 
(rhythmic music)

14
00:00:42.154 --> 00:00:43.980
What prompted you to tell this story?

15
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.006
<v ->A friend of mine suggested that war profiteering</v>

16
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:51.846
was one of the great uncovered stories and he felt

17
00:00:51.846 --> 00:00:55.406
that if we could do the movie and do it reasonably quickly,

18
00:00:55.406 --> 00:00:58.886
come the fall, when we're in the election campaign,

19
00:00:58.886 --> 00:01:00.996
we could use the film to force a

20
00:01:00.996 --> 00:01:03.597
debate about war profiteering.

21
00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:04.816
This was in January.

22
00:01:04.816 --> 00:01:07.075
It's now September and we were able to get it done

23
00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:11.092
on an insane schedule and hopefully, now,

24
00:01:11.092 --> 00:01:14.092
it's doing what it needs to do, which is people

25
00:01:14.092 --> 00:01:17.192
are taking it, they're screening it, they're organizing it,

26
00:01:17.192 --> 00:01:20.692
and they're using it to ask questions about

27
00:01:20.692 --> 00:01:23.332
what's going on with war profiteering,

28
00:01:23.332 --> 00:01:26.202
who's protecting me, and who's not protecting me.

29
00:01:27.542 --> 00:01:29.159
<v Regina>If we can get into a little bit,</v>

30
00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.296
how did this story, what revealed itself to you in the

31
00:01:33.296 --> 00:01:35.270
process of researching this subject,

32
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.501
and get into the meat and bones of it little bit.

33
00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:41.602
<v ->As we started the research, I was sure that</v>

34
00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:45.822
there would be some troubling facts and figures.

35
00:01:45.822 --> 00:01:50.122
What I didn't really focus on is that profiteering

36
00:01:50.122 --> 00:01:53.842
is not a victimless crime, it's not a white-collar crime,

37
00:01:53.842 --> 00:01:56.302
which kind of just goes out into the environment

38
00:01:56.302 --> 00:01:59.243
and you don't know how it's affecting anybody.

39
00:01:59.243 --> 00:02:01.902
People's lives are being lost and in the movie,

40
00:02:01.902 --> 00:02:04.082
we have truck drivers whose best friends

41
00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:07.580
were killed in Iraq because Halliburton

42
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.281
was cutting corners to make a bigger profit.

43
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:14.020
The head of Halliburton has made over $100,000,000

44
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.719
in his stock since the war began.

45
00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.620
We have mothers whose sons were killed at Fallujah

46
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.298
because Blackwater was trying to save money

47
00:02:23.298 --> 00:02:25.758
and doing things they shouldn't have done,

48
00:02:25.758 --> 00:02:28.138
and we have interrogators at Abu Ghraib

49
00:02:28.138 --> 00:02:31.436
talking about the fact that they were hired by CACI,

50
00:02:31.436 --> 00:02:34.236
a for-profit company, and sent

51
00:02:34.236 --> 00:02:36.976
into Abu Ghraib to make a profit.

52
00:02:36.976 --> 00:02:40.696
The head of CACI made $20,000,000.

53
00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:42.456
Those are things I had no idea about

54
00:02:42.456 --> 00:02:46.256
and I was troubled and shocked and it was painful

55
00:02:46.256 --> 00:02:48.826
because people's lives are being lost.

56
00:02:48.826 --> 00:02:52.192
<v Regina>We're not just talking about mercenaries.</v>

57
00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:55.248
I think, even when the war first began, there were stories

58
00:02:55.248 --> 00:02:58.428
about people who went over in a more mercenary fashion,

59
00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:01.108
you know, bold men to make a profit,

60
00:03:01.108 --> 00:03:02.848
knowing what they were getting into.

61
00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:06.528
This is not exactly what we're talking about here, is it?

62
00:03:06.528 --> 00:03:08.608
<v ->No, what we're focused on in the movie</v>

63
00:03:08.608 --> 00:03:12.388
is the corporations, the boards of directors,

64
00:03:12.388 --> 00:03:17.328
the heads of the corporations, who are leading the charge

65
00:03:17.328 --> 00:03:20.900
to profit from the war at the very same time

66
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.760
that men and women, Americans, Iraqis, children

67
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.060
are being killed and hospitals are not being built,

68
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.660
these companies are taking hundreds of millions

69
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.620
and literally billions of dollars out of Iraq

70
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.480
and into their private coffers.

71
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.019
That's wrong and there's been no discussion of it.

72
00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.020
<v Regina>Right, very little discussion</v>

73
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.260
and can you give us an example of a couple

74
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.439
of different people that were induced into this

75
00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.480
civilian position in this war-zone?

76
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.312
Specifics, a couple specifics?

77
00:03:56.312 --> 00:03:58.352
<v ->There's a truck driver in the movie.</v>

78
00:03:58.352 --> 00:03:59.912
A guy I just love, I haven't met him,

79
00:03:59.912 --> 00:04:02.212
it's just been on the phone, named Shane,

80
00:04:02.212 --> 00:04:06.832
and he talks about going over there to help his family,

81
00:04:06.832 --> 00:04:11.712
to do the right thing, to rebuild Iraq, to help the troops,

82
00:04:11.712 --> 00:04:13.733
goes to work for Halliburton, truck driver,

83
00:04:13.733 --> 00:04:17.032
just driving a truck in some city in the United States.

84
00:04:17.032 --> 00:04:18.772
<v Regina>He thinks he's part of the good effort.</v>

85
00:04:18.772 --> 00:04:22.632
<v ->Yeah, and he gets over there and he discovers that,</v>

86
00:04:22.632 --> 00:04:24.834
and I didn't believe this when I first heard it,

87
00:04:25.984 --> 00:04:29.092
Halliburton's charging you and everybody watching this

88
00:04:29.092 --> 00:04:33.778
cause it's out tax dollars, $45 for a six-pack of Coke.

89
00:04:34.788 --> 00:04:36.084
<v Regina>You are kidding...</v>

90
00:04:36.084 --> 00:04:39.724
I've heard of these exorbitant prices, $45 for a six-pack?

91
00:04:39.724 --> 00:04:41.884
<v ->Right, and we heard that over and over and over again</v>

92
00:04:41.884 --> 00:04:46.560
and then, a soldier and several other Halliburton

93
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.255
truck drivers talk about setting

94
00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:52.791
their laundry out, t-shirts, underwear, $100.

95
00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:56.471
Now, all of that comes out of your pocket because these

96
00:04:56.471 --> 00:05:01.441
contracts are what's called cost-plus contracts, it means--

97
00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:02.807
<v Regina>What's that mean cost-plus--</v>

98
00:05:02.807 --> 00:05:03.890
<v ->Well, that's what I'm--
<v Regina>(laughs)</v>

99
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.988
<v ->What it means is that whatever the cost is</v>

100
00:05:06.988 --> 00:05:11.818
Halliburton gets that money, plus a built-in profit

101
00:05:11.818 --> 00:05:15.626
based on the size of the contract, which means

102
00:05:15.626 --> 00:05:18.346
the more you spend, the more profit you make

103
00:05:18.346 --> 00:05:22.346
so there's absolutely no inducement or incentive

104
00:05:22.346 --> 00:05:24.686
or reason for them to spend less.

105
00:05:24.686 --> 00:05:26.766
In fact, there's reason to spend more.

106
00:05:26.766 --> 00:05:27.926
<v Regina>So how would you cost-plus</v>

107
00:05:27.926 --> 00:05:30.946
a six-pack of Coke up to $45?

108
00:05:32.516 --> 00:05:36.190
<v ->Halliburton is run by a former Enron accountant so a</v>

109
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.930
(Regina laughing)

110
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.316
guy from Arthur Andersen, which helps explain some of that.

111
00:05:40.316 --> 00:05:41.764
It's pretty staggering.

112
00:05:41.764 --> 00:05:44.225
<v Regina>It is staggering, but there has to be</v>

113
00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:48.744
a solid and tempting inducement for the people

114
00:05:48.744 --> 00:05:50.484
that do volunteer or are hired

115
00:05:50.484 --> 00:05:52.224
by the corporations to go over there.

116
00:05:52.224 --> 00:05:54.284
What's the story they're told,

117
00:05:54.284 --> 00:05:58.317
while they're still here, before they go to Iraq?

118
00:05:58.317 --> 00:05:59.356
<v ->First of all, they're told they'll</v>

119
00:05:59.356 --> 00:06:00.854
be safe or they have been told.

120
00:06:00.854 --> 00:06:03.184
One of the reasons I hope the people will screen the film

121
00:06:03.184 --> 00:06:06.151
all over is we have to break that mythology down.

122
00:06:06.151 --> 00:06:08.452
People have to know how dangerous it is

123
00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:11.152
and second of all, we are at a time in the United States

124
00:06:11.152 --> 00:06:14.441
where it's tragic, but a truck driver has to go to Iraq

125
00:06:14.441 --> 00:06:17.768
to make a living to pay for his healthcare or

126
00:06:17.768 --> 00:06:19.868
to put his children through school.

127
00:06:19.868 --> 00:06:23.909
That's a tragedy of the worst kind and again,

128
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:27.349
like in the Walmart movie, we're looking at a system.

129
00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:29.769
We're not looking at individual crooks.

130
00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:32.108
We're looking at a system of profit,

131
00:06:32.108 --> 00:06:36.268
large corporations that give money to politicians

132
00:06:36.268 --> 00:06:39.889
that hire former high-level military and politicians,

133
00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:43.988
and as a result, are getting significant contracts

134
00:06:43.988 --> 00:06:47.629
and making millions and ultimately billions of dollars.

135
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:50.068
<v Regina>So how much are they offering</v>

136
00:06:50.068 --> 00:06:52.288
to these people to do a truck driving job?

137
00:06:52.288 --> 00:06:54.068
I assume it's for a Tour of Duty,

138
00:06:54.068 --> 00:06:56.168
for a few months or a set period of time.

139
00:06:56.168 --> 00:06:57.168
<v ->It's variable.</v>

140
00:06:57.168 --> 00:06:58.687
It depends on what trucks you're in,

141
00:06:58.687 --> 00:07:00.048
what part of the country it is,

142
00:07:00.048 --> 00:07:03.687
but the things that the soldiers told me over and over again

143
00:07:03.687 --> 00:07:06.465
is that they would be working right next to somebody,

144
00:07:06.465 --> 00:07:09.986
who would be doing exactly the same job as the soldier,

145
00:07:09.986 --> 00:07:11.023
and that person would be getting

146
00:07:11.023 --> 00:07:14.562
three and four times what the soldier made,

147
00:07:14.562 --> 00:07:17.903
and again, your tax dollars are paying for that.

148
00:07:17.903 --> 00:07:19.162
<v Regina>So it's a significant amount</v>

149
00:07:19.162 --> 00:07:20.742
of money to be a truck driver.

150
00:07:20.742 --> 00:07:22.671
<v ->Oh yeah, yes.</v>

151
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:26.733
<v Regina>They're tempted into going over for all the</v>

152
00:07:26.733 --> 00:07:29.732
obvious reasons to take care of their families and so forth.

153
00:07:29.732 --> 00:07:31.793
They get there, and they're promised that this

154
00:07:31.793 --> 00:07:35.492
is a civilian job, you will not be in any particular danger.

155
00:07:36.662 --> 00:07:40.519
Give us a couple of examples where that was not the case.

156
00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:43.864
<v ->We have a story in the film called "The Friday Massacre",</v>

157
00:07:43.864 --> 00:07:46.345
where these truck drivers talk about the fact,

158
00:07:46.345 --> 00:07:48.464
there were two of them who survived, and actually,

159
00:07:48.464 --> 00:07:49.445
there were four of them who survived,

160
00:07:49.445 --> 00:07:52.504
two of them are in the movie and they tell the story

161
00:07:52.504 --> 00:07:55.864
of getting up and driving that day down a road

162
00:07:55.864 --> 00:07:59.705
that had been closed, that had been marked dangerous,

163
00:07:59.705 --> 00:08:02.054
but Halliburton pushed it because

164
00:08:02.054 --> 00:08:03.942
they get paid by the number of trips,

165
00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:06.643
by they way, they don't have to deliver anything.

166
00:08:06.643 --> 00:08:09.580
They just have to take trips so we even had truck drivers

167
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.440
tell us about driving, virtually, empty trucks across Iraq

168
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.340
because the billing procedure awards Halliburton for that.

169
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.380
<v Regina>That's criminal.</v>

170
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.214
<v ->Yeah, and in this particular case, "Friday Massacre",</v>

171
00:08:20.214 --> 00:08:24.494
we have the two women whose husbands were killed

172
00:08:24.494 --> 00:08:28.212
in that massacre because Halliburton did not abide

173
00:08:28.212 --> 00:08:32.992
by any kind of safety rules or regulations

174
00:08:32.992 --> 00:08:34.512
and there was no protection or

175
00:08:34.512 --> 00:08:37.513
very little protection and they were driven

176
00:08:37.513 --> 00:08:41.052
as corporations are to maximize dollars.

177
00:08:41.052 --> 00:08:42.912
We all have had the experience.

178
00:08:42.912 --> 00:08:45.312
We all know what large corporations do,

179
00:08:45.312 --> 00:08:48.872
whether it's cutting a job, or eliminating

180
00:08:48.872 --> 00:08:53.792
a function, or having less expensive goods,

181
00:08:53.792 --> 00:08:57.460
corporations are driven to maximize profit.

182
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.544
When you do that in the war, people are gonna die,

183
00:09:00.544 --> 00:09:02.812
and people are dying as a result of that.

184
00:09:04.262 --> 00:09:06.118
<v Regina>And they can get away with it, I'm assuming,</v>

185
00:09:06.118 --> 00:09:09.198
because outside of films like this,

186
00:09:09.198 --> 00:09:12.167
they're really out of harms way.

187
00:09:13.655 --> 00:09:17.135
They're out of the view of the camera

188
00:09:17.135 --> 00:09:19.866
because everything is so heavily censored in terms of

189
00:09:19.866 --> 00:09:22.433
what comes out on the evening news, for example.

190
00:09:22.433 --> 00:09:24.433
How was this working within the system?

191
00:09:24.433 --> 00:09:28.194
How did you get the videos and also,

192
00:09:28.194 --> 00:09:29.313
I assume a lot of the interviews you

193
00:09:29.313 --> 00:09:32.029
must have gotten after they had returned.

194
00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:34.470
How did this work in gathering the information

195
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.269
when it is so heavily censored?

196
00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:38.689
<v ->It was a challenge finding the people,</v>

197
00:09:39.989 --> 00:09:41.305
but people who'd been through some

198
00:09:41.305 --> 00:09:44.265
of these horrific experiences, many of them wanted

199
00:09:44.265 --> 00:09:49.143
to be able to talk about it for some good to come out of it

200
00:09:49.143 --> 00:09:52.143
so we spent a lot of time and a lot of energy reaching out

201
00:09:52.143 --> 00:09:54.823
and there's been some great reporting, actually.

202
00:09:54.823 --> 00:09:57.101
T. Chrisitian Miller, who writes for the L.A. Times,

203
00:09:57.101 --> 00:09:58.381
done some great stories and he has

204
00:09:58.381 --> 00:10:00.888
a brilliant book out called "Blood Money".

205
00:10:00.888 --> 00:10:03.751
James Glanz I think it is who writes for the New York Times

206
00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:07.632
so there's been a few reporters that I'm aware of

207
00:10:07.632 --> 00:10:10.111
who've done really good work on this,

208
00:10:10.111 --> 00:10:14.572
but it's one of those issues that needs the dots connected

209
00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:17.791
so that you don't just read an individual story

210
00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:21.531
about one contract for Halliburton,

211
00:10:21.531 --> 00:10:23.992
where they overcharge the government,

212
00:10:23.992 --> 00:10:27.651
but you look at the pattern, and you understand the causes,

213
00:10:27.651 --> 00:10:29.771
you understand it's a cost-plus contract,

214
00:10:29.771 --> 00:10:34.311
and you understand that they give millions of dollars

215
00:10:34.311 --> 00:10:36.828
to political candidates each year.

216
00:10:36.828 --> 00:10:39.927
They spend millions of dollars on lobbyists

217
00:10:39.927 --> 00:10:42.906
and so the dots start to connect.

218
00:10:42.906 --> 00:10:44.363
<v Regina>And we hear this, we've heard it</v>

219
00:10:44.363 --> 00:10:46.642
throughout time, also, not just in war profiteering,

220
00:10:46.642 --> 00:10:50.423
but NASA, where you pay $2,000 for a toilet seat,

221
00:10:50.423 --> 00:10:52.342
but we think, well that's high-tech, I mean,

222
00:10:52.342 --> 00:10:53.683
gravity's a little different up there.

223
00:10:53.683 --> 00:10:58.682
Okay, we can bite that one, but $45 for Coke.

224
00:10:58.682 --> 00:11:00.038
<v ->Well a six-pack of Coke.</v>

225
00:11:00.038 --> 00:11:02.556
<v Regina>Okay, yeah, six-pack, excuse me. (laughs)</v>

226
00:11:02.556 --> 00:11:03.709
I hate to think of what it had
<v ->Not for single Coke.</v>

227
00:11:03.709 --> 00:11:05.909
<v Regina>been otherwise, it'd been a few hundred dollars.</v>

228
00:11:07.309 --> 00:11:09.443
How has this been received with

229
00:11:09.443 --> 00:11:12.153
the media at large, stirring this up.

230
00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:15.457
By the way, congratulations for stirring it up.

231
00:11:15.457 --> 00:11:15.936
<v ->Thank you.</v>

232
00:11:15.936 --> 00:11:17.655
<v Regina>How has the media been receiving it?</v>

233
00:11:17.655 --> 00:11:19.074
Have you been getting much media?

234
00:11:19.074 --> 00:11:20.613
<v ->We have actually, it's been...</v>

235
00:11:21.772 --> 00:11:24.330
The film doesn't take a political position

236
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.610
in a sense of political party

237
00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.769
or whether your even against or in favor of the war.

238
00:11:30.769 --> 00:11:32.190
There are Republicans in the film.

239
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.519
There are Conservatives in the film by design,

240
00:11:36.059 --> 00:11:39.417
and while the primary media is never

241
00:11:40.677 --> 00:11:44.243
looking to focus on the serious issues for the most part.

242
00:11:44.243 --> 00:11:46.343
That's no fault of the journalist.

243
00:11:46.343 --> 00:11:48.943
The system is there to maximize dollars

244
00:11:48.943 --> 00:11:51.823
and, therefore, the pressure on the news

245
00:11:51.823 --> 00:11:55.183
to do somebody having a baby, rather than

246
00:11:55.183 --> 00:11:57.044
some of the major issues of the day,

247
00:11:57.044 --> 00:11:59.983
but having said that, ABC National News

248
00:11:59.983 --> 00:12:01.903
did a two-minute piece on the film

249
00:12:01.903 --> 00:12:04.264
and profiteering last week.

250
00:12:04.264 --> 00:12:07.083
This week I'll be doing many of the cable shows,

251
00:12:07.083 --> 00:12:10.375
The Washington Post, Chicago Tribune,

252
00:12:10.375 --> 00:12:13.096
and other papers have done pretty major pieces

253
00:12:13.096 --> 00:12:15.855
so I think we have an opportunity

254
00:12:15.855 --> 00:12:18.755
to do what we wanna do with the film,

255
00:12:18.755 --> 00:12:22.655
which is get people talking, get a debate going,

256
00:12:22.655 --> 00:12:27.225
and because the films are distributed alternatively,

257
00:12:27.225 --> 00:12:30.091
every time there's a screening,

258
00:12:30.091 --> 00:12:33.024
there's a discussion afterwards about what to do.

259
00:12:33.024 --> 00:12:35.276
That's a big difference than going to the movie theater,

260
00:12:35.276 --> 00:12:37.516
which I love, and we're also in the movie theaters,

261
00:12:37.516 --> 00:12:39.377
but what happens after the move theater,

262
00:12:39.377 --> 00:12:41.397
your primary concern is getting rid of

263
00:12:41.397 --> 00:12:45.292
the plastic cup that you drank your Diet Coke from.

264
00:12:45.292 --> 00:12:48.833
Here, the primary concern is what are you gonna do?

265
00:12:48.833 --> 00:12:49.992
Are you gonna write a letter?

266
00:12:49.992 --> 00:12:51.633
Are you gonna make a phone call?

267
00:12:51.633 --> 00:12:53.833
Are you gonna go sit-in at an office?

268
00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:56.032
Are you gonna join Amnesty International?

269
00:12:56.032 --> 00:12:58.633
What is the action you will take?

270
00:12:58.633 --> 00:13:01.450
We're able to do that because the films are distributed

271
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.050
in homes, in churches, in schools,

272
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.058
in union halls, et cetera, et cetera.

273
00:13:06.109 --> 00:13:07.849
<v Regina>And this is really a battle against</v>

274
00:13:07.849 --> 00:13:12.497
corporatocracy, really influencing our decisions in D.C.,

275
00:13:13.347 --> 00:13:15.165
and the allocation of these funds,

276
00:13:15.165 --> 00:13:17.905
and for that matter, why we're there at all.

277
00:13:17.905 --> 00:13:20.265
<v ->We don't actually go into why we're there.</v>

278
00:13:21.875 --> 00:13:24.121
Some people will make the interpretation

279
00:13:24.121 --> 00:13:27.681
that this is an aspect of going into Iraq.

280
00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:28.581
<v Regina>Mm-hm.</v>

281
00:13:28.581 --> 00:13:30.131
<v ->What I tried to do was stay with</v>

282
00:13:30.131 --> 00:13:31.695
absolutely what I could prove factually

283
00:13:31.695 --> 00:13:34.735
and what I could prove factually is

284
00:13:34.735 --> 00:13:37.155
Halliburton gives millions of dollars,

285
00:13:37.155 --> 00:13:42.019
Halliburton votes, any kind of vote to restrict Halliburton

286
00:13:42.019 --> 00:13:44.309
doesn't have a chance in hell,

287
00:13:44.309 --> 00:13:48.667
and we have concrete evidence of their profiteering.

288
00:13:48.667 --> 00:13:51.628
<v Regina>Right, and you did this</v>

289
00:13:51.628 --> 00:13:54.358
and we talked about this in our last interview,

290
00:13:54.358 --> 00:13:56.598
which is so clever, which is to stay away

291
00:13:56.598 --> 00:13:59.218
from Hollywood corporatocracy in essence.

292
00:13:59.218 --> 00:14:01.958
You go to the people directly and you have,

293
00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.798
I assume, had some good success

294
00:14:03.798 --> 00:14:05.418
with people really coming on board

295
00:14:05.418 --> 00:14:07.078
with the donations and supporting this.

296
00:14:07.078 --> 00:14:08.498
Is this how it's gotten made?

297
00:14:08.498 --> 00:14:10.478
<v ->Yes, in this particular case, we weren't able</v>

298
00:14:10.478 --> 00:14:12.938
to raise the money so we went out to people

299
00:14:12.938 --> 00:14:15.518
who bought the films and we had,

300
00:14:15.518 --> 00:14:16.798
cause we had about a week-and-a-half,

301
00:14:16.798 --> 00:14:20.919
we had three-thousand twenty, thirty people

302
00:14:20.919 --> 00:14:23.728
who contributed $25 and $50 each,

303
00:14:23.728 --> 00:14:26.386
which allowed the film to happen

304
00:14:26.386 --> 00:14:30.373
and it was quite astounding and we actually had a screening.

305
00:14:30.373 --> 00:14:33.254
Our first screening of the film was in Los Angeles

306
00:14:33.254 --> 00:14:36.772
and Santa Monica for hundreds of the people

307
00:14:36.772 --> 00:14:40.482
who had made this $25 and $50 contribution.

308
00:14:40.482 --> 00:14:42.103
<v Regina>It is in theaters, right?</v>

309
00:14:42.103 --> 00:14:44.003
It's in some major cities.

310
00:14:44.003 --> 00:14:44.940
It has shown in--
<v ->So it's in New York.</v>

311
00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:45.415
<v Regina>And what are you planning</v>

312
00:14:45.415 --> 00:14:47.175
on doing for theater distribution.

313
00:14:47.175 --> 00:14:50.335
Do you expect wide distribution or are you really

314
00:14:50.335 --> 00:14:53.596
going to the people more to do the home presentations,

315
00:14:53.596 --> 00:14:55.396
libraries, rec halls, et cetera?

316
00:14:55.396 --> 00:14:57.852
<v ->We will have very wide distributions, like Walmart</v>

317
00:14:57.852 --> 00:15:00.610
we had 7,000 screenings, but they were in homes,

318
00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.750
and churches, and schools, and we'll

319
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.746
similarly have quite wide distribution of events,

320
00:15:05.746 --> 00:15:07.886
but again, I want alternative distribution

321
00:15:07.886 --> 00:15:10.287
because I want a discussion after every screening,

322
00:15:10.287 --> 00:15:13.901
and rather than, just walking out of the movie theater.

323
00:15:13.901 --> 00:15:16.602
<v Regina>Right, so what do you have to say</v>

324
00:15:16.602 --> 00:15:18.701
to people watching this as to how they can become

325
00:15:18.701 --> 00:15:22.421
involved over the next few months or so, ideally,

326
00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:25.621
over the next month-and-a-half, before the election?

327
00:15:25.621 --> 00:15:29.242
<v ->We made it pretty simple and proactive,</v>

328
00:15:29.242 --> 00:15:32.121
which is you go to iraqforsale.org,

329
00:15:32.121 --> 00:15:34.881
order a copy of the movie, look at the movie,

330
00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:37.021
and then you say, "What am I gonna do?".

331
00:15:37.021 --> 00:15:40.341
"I can join an organization, I can write a letter,

332
00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:43.604
"I can call my Congressman, or I can do a screening."

333
00:15:43.604 --> 00:15:47.762
The beauty of the films, content aside, is it gives every

334
00:15:47.762 --> 00:15:52.365
one of us an opportunity to be active in a Democracy.

335
00:15:52.365 --> 00:15:54.845
It gives us an opportunity to do something other than

336
00:15:54.845 --> 00:15:57.685
complain that we don't like the way things are going.

337
00:15:57.685 --> 00:16:00.741
It gives us an opportunity to go to our website

338
00:16:00.741 --> 00:16:03.641
and list the screening, and you can make it private,

339
00:16:03.641 --> 00:16:05.821
or you can open it up, and you can have friends,

340
00:16:05.821 --> 00:16:07.741
and colleagues, and schoolmates,

341
00:16:07.741 --> 00:16:09.421
and people from work sign-up.

342
00:16:09.421 --> 00:16:11.016
You could have strangers you don't know.

343
00:16:11.016 --> 00:16:12.996
We've had amazing experiences with people

344
00:16:12.996 --> 00:16:15.397
in the neighborhood so we list it by zip code.

345
00:16:15.397 --> 00:16:18.056
You go on, you put your zip in, and you can find out what--

346
00:16:18.056 --> 00:16:20.000
<v Regina>Yeah, I like that.</v>
<v ->screenings are near you.</v>

347
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.061
It's truly a creation of the internet technology,

348
00:16:25.221 --> 00:16:27.515
but it allows everybody to do something.

349
00:16:27.515 --> 00:16:30.605
The only area that I have zero patience

350
00:16:30.605 --> 00:16:32.218
is for people, who say, "Oh, everything's

351
00:16:32.218 --> 00:16:34.379
"so terrible, there's nothing I can do."

352
00:16:34.379 --> 00:16:36.006
That's nonsense.

353
00:16:36.006 --> 00:16:39.142
There are things you can do, and the film is a tool.

354
00:16:39.142 --> 00:16:43.142
It's only successful if you see it and do something.

355
00:16:43.142 --> 00:16:47.322
It's a complete failure if you see it and don't do anything.

356
00:16:47.322 --> 00:16:49.103
<v Regina>Very true.</v>

357
00:16:49.103 --> 00:16:52.341
If you don't mind my going into (laughs)

358
00:16:52.341 --> 00:16:54.741
one of your experiences with the media,

359
00:16:54.741 --> 00:16:58.542
I saw you on Steven Colbert. (both laugh)

360
00:16:58.542 --> 00:17:02.562
You appealed to your support base as to,

361
00:17:02.562 --> 00:17:04.738
"Holy cow, I'm going up with this guy.

362
00:17:04.738 --> 00:17:06.678
"What should I do, Any suggestions?"

363
00:17:06.678 --> 00:17:08.178
I think I even wrote a suggestion.

364
00:17:08.178 --> 00:17:09.798
I'm sure you got thousands of them.

365
00:17:11.318 --> 00:17:14.186
How was it going with Steven Colbert?

366
00:17:14.186 --> 00:17:16.347
He's so off-the-wall. (both laugh)

367
00:17:16.347 --> 00:17:18.224
<v ->I'm a huge fan of the program.</v>

368
00:17:18.224 --> 00:17:19.325
I'm a huge fan of him.

369
00:17:19.325 --> 00:17:22.621
I think he's just brilliant and it's challenging because

370
00:17:22.621 --> 00:17:24.981
if your going against the true

371
00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:26.001
right-wingers, you know what to do.

372
00:17:26.001 --> 00:17:28.501
You yell, you scream, you fight, you call each other names,

373
00:17:28.501 --> 00:17:30.897
but you know, he's doing this brilliant thing where

374
00:17:30.897 --> 00:17:32.557
he's sort of a double-agent--

375
00:17:32.557 --> 00:17:34.594
<v Regina>Like a faux right-winger. (laughs)</v>

376
00:17:34.594 --> 00:17:36.009
<v ->Yeah, and so it was a challenge,</v>

377
00:17:36.009 --> 00:17:39.029
but it was a good challenge and he's so smart, and so quick,

378
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.764
and so funny.
<v Regina>Isn't he clever?</v>

379
00:17:39.764 --> 00:17:40.459
<v ->Yeah.</v>

380
00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:42.119
<v Regina>I thought you held your own very well.</v>

381
00:17:42.119 --> 00:17:44.548
Any plans of going a round with him again on this one?

382
00:17:44.548 --> 00:17:46.979
<v ->(laughs) Probably, it's took soon from their point of view</v>

383
00:17:46.979 --> 00:17:48.780
because they like to have a year

384
00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.016
before they bring guests back.

385
00:17:50.016 --> 00:17:52.715
<v Regina>(laughs) So you wanna tease us</v>

386
00:17:52.715 --> 00:17:55.335
a little bit if you feel free to of what's coming up next?

387
00:17:55.335 --> 00:17:56.596
I think you were working on this

388
00:17:56.596 --> 00:17:59.396
last time we saw you with the Walmart movie.

389
00:17:59.396 --> 00:18:01.575
<v ->This has pretty much taken the</v>

390
00:18:01.575 --> 00:18:04.295
last living breath out of all of us.

391
00:18:04.295 --> 00:18:05.904
We need to finish it.

392
00:18:05.904 --> 00:18:07.998
We have a month-and-a-half of hard work.

393
00:18:07.998 --> 00:18:11.419
I'm touring all next week, going city to city to city

394
00:18:11.419 --> 00:18:13.959
and we have work of getting it out.

395
00:18:13.959 --> 00:18:16.239
Then we will stop and see where we are,

396
00:18:16.239 --> 00:18:19.578
deal with the challenges of fundraising,

397
00:18:19.578 --> 00:18:23.555
and look to the Spring to see what our resources are.

398
00:18:23.555 --> 00:18:27.775
There's no lack of possibilities and no lack of subjects.

399
00:18:27.775 --> 00:18:30.395
I actually would like to put some time and energy

400
00:18:30.395 --> 00:18:33.745
into doing short pieces, rapid-response videos.

401
00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:35.327
<v Regina>What does that mean, rapid-response videos?</v>

402
00:18:35.327 --> 00:18:37.427
<v ->The film takes a year, year-and-a-half even,</v>

403
00:18:37.427 --> 00:18:40.306
and that's fast, but I wanna, if I can raise some funds

404
00:18:40.306 --> 00:18:43.446
and if I can get groups behind us,

405
00:18:43.446 --> 00:18:47.786
I want a little guerrilla unit that would,

406
00:18:47.786 --> 00:18:49.766
you know, something comes up in the news,

407
00:18:49.766 --> 00:18:52.126
in 24 hours, you create a video.

408
00:18:52.126 --> 00:18:52.841
<v Regina>Fabulous.</v>

409
00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:54.008
<v ->And you push it back out there</v>

410
00:18:54.008 --> 00:18:56.261
and we're in discussions and I'm hopeful.

411
00:18:57.471 --> 00:18:58.918
<v Regina>You have the vehicle with the internet</v>

412
00:18:58.918 --> 00:19:02.398
and streaming becoming as simple as it is for everybody now.

413
00:19:02.398 --> 00:19:05.338
Fabulous, well thank you so much for taking the time.

414
00:19:05.338 --> 00:19:06.138
<v ->Pleasure.
<v Regina>I know you're a</v>

415
00:19:06.138 --> 00:19:08.836
very busy, once again, and we'll see you next time

416
00:19:08.836 --> 00:19:10.915
after you get your guerrilla warfare going.

417
00:19:10.915 --> 00:19:13.476
<v ->Okay. (both laugh)</v>

418
00:19:13.476 --> 00:19:14.751
Thank you.

419
00:19:14.751 --> 00:19:16.979
<v ->You can support the spread of this information</v>

420
00:19:16.979 --> 00:19:20.059
by clicking on the link to "Iraq for Sale" below

421
00:19:20.059 --> 00:19:22.260
and become part of the community airings.

422
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.219
You might also be interested in buying a DVD for yourself.

423
00:19:25.219 --> 00:19:27.459
Meanwhile, to see what he had to say regarding

424
00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:30.519
the mega-store takeover of American consumerism,

425
00:19:30.519 --> 00:19:32.760
watch our previous interview with Robert

426
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.360
on his film titled "Walmart: The High Cost of Cheap Goods".

427
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.680
Until next time, thanks for watching.

428
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.487
(rhythmic music)
