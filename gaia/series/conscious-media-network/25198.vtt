(soft music)

2
00:00:15.591 --> 00:00:17.432
<v ->As I've said many times before,</v>

3
00:00:17.432 --> 00:00:19.431
this is the time of Revelations.

4
00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:22.628
Simply that truth is being revealed in all quarters of life.

5
00:00:22.628 --> 00:00:25.789
There's no institution that is shielded from scrutiny now,

6
00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.748
be it government, religion, or popular culture.

7
00:00:28.748 --> 00:00:30.489
When Foster Gamble, an heir to the

8
00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.989
Proctor and Gamble fortune, became aware of the

9
00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.289
truth as to how the people of the planet have been

10
00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.330
controlled by the ruling elite, he and his wife Kimberly

11
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.630
dedicated themselves to creating a cohesive film,

12
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.309
a story of human potential, the quashing of that potential,

13
00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.052
and ending with a call for recovering our truth.

14
00:00:48.052 --> 00:00:50.072
The film is called Thrive and has already

15
00:00:50.072 --> 00:00:52.872
had more than two million views around the world.

16
00:00:52.872 --> 00:00:57.493
It's a film whose time has finally come.

17
00:00:57.493 --> 00:00:58.853
Well, first of all, Foster, I have to say

18
00:00:58.853 --> 00:01:01.313
I'm so happy to be sitting here with you.

19
00:01:01.313 --> 00:01:04.615
You're a busy man, your film is

20
00:01:04.615 --> 00:01:07.235
tearing around the planet right now.

21
00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:09.835
We were talking off camera, over two million

22
00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:11.815
or nearly two million views--
<v Foster>Getting close.</v>

23
00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:12.894
<v Regina>And that's not even counting</v>

24
00:01:12.894 --> 00:01:14.534
what might be pirated. (laughs)

25
00:01:14.534 --> 00:01:16.855
<v ->Well, that is counting, a lot of what</v>

26
00:01:16.855 --> 00:01:19.034
has been pirated on YouTube.

27
00:01:19.034 --> 00:01:20.974
<v Regina>And so, obviously this message is</v>

28
00:01:20.974 --> 00:01:23.336
striking a chord, and the thing about it that's really,

29
00:01:23.336 --> 00:01:27.255
I find fascinating, is that your demeanor,

30
00:01:27.255 --> 00:01:30.376
the commitment to the film, the production values

31
00:01:30.376 --> 00:01:33.316
and such have allowed you to take forward a message

32
00:01:33.316 --> 00:01:36.496
that people up to, really this time, have

33
00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:38.916
been somewhat resistant to hear.

34
00:01:38.916 --> 00:01:41.416
<v ->Well, I wish that my wife Kimberly were able</v>

35
00:01:41.416 --> 00:01:44.316
to be here with me today because unfortunately,

36
00:01:44.316 --> 00:01:46.936
fortunately for her, she's attending a birth of

37
00:01:46.936 --> 00:01:50.315
a grandchild, but we have been a team all along in this,

38
00:01:50.315 --> 00:01:53.476
and I attribute so much of the tone and the success

39
00:01:53.476 --> 00:01:58.335
of Thrive to her relentlessly and so gently

40
00:01:58.335 --> 00:02:01.590
bringing in the feminine energy, and just teaching

41
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.389
me how to be confident in what we know about

42
00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:09.949
the way out for humanity, and then relaying

43
00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.610
the information in a way that really

44
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.210
honors people's intelligence, and at the same time,

45
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.230
gives them their own emotional space for

46
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.670
whatever comes up, rather than trying to force

47
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.891
my passion on them or try to scare them

48
00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:23.911
into action, or something like that,

49
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:25.950
and it's really working, especially

50
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.210
for women and for young people.

51
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.151
<v Regina>Women and young people,</v>

52
00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:31.711
that's a growing demographic with the film?

53
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:33.851
<v ->Well, it's a particularly unusual one for some</v>

54
00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:35.562
of the information that we cover,

55
00:02:35.562 --> 00:02:37.782
especially in relation to conspiracy

56
00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:40.523
and some of the science and so forth.

57
00:02:40.523 --> 00:02:44.162
I'm loving seeing how broad an audience is taking

58
00:02:44.162 --> 00:02:48.062
in everything from new energy science to UFOs

59
00:02:48.062 --> 00:02:51.642
to conspiracy to the real principles of liberty,

60
00:02:51.642 --> 00:02:54.183
and then wanting to focus all that on solutions.

61
00:02:54.183 --> 00:02:57.562
It's really reaffirming for me as to the incredible

62
00:02:57.562 --> 00:02:59.782
intelligence and power of the human spirit

63
00:02:59.782 --> 00:03:01.882
when it's treated with respect.

64
00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:03.534
<v Regina>Yes, because again, a lot of these</v>

65
00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:05.944
subjects are intrinsically a little frightening to people,

66
00:03:05.944 --> 00:03:07.784
especially if they haven't already

67
00:03:07.784 --> 00:03:09.644
been familiar with these topics.

68
00:03:09.644 --> 00:03:10.864
And we're talking about a lot of people

69
00:03:10.864 --> 00:03:13.764
I've interviewed on CMN that are prominent,

70
00:03:13.764 --> 00:03:16.564
such as David Icke and others in this film,

71
00:03:16.564 --> 00:03:19.455
are sharing the realities that they have assessed

72
00:03:19.455 --> 00:03:20.875
throughout time which are, these are

73
00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:23.345
some harsh realities, which is, as you said

74
00:03:23.345 --> 00:03:26.406
in the film that there are a handful of individuals

75
00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:28.767
who do not want to see humanity thrive.

76
00:03:28.767 --> 00:03:31.106
We're going to anyway, but who do not wish

77
00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:33.506
to see humanity thrive, and we have been

78
00:03:33.506 --> 00:03:36.166
under that spell for awhile now.

79
00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:38.026
And can you talk a little bit about what it was

80
00:03:38.026 --> 00:03:40.526
in you that wanted to reveal that story

81
00:03:40.526 --> 00:03:44.526
to people in this kind and gentle way?

82
00:03:44.526 --> 00:03:48.886
<v ->Well, when I was in college, I was introduced</v>

83
00:03:48.886 --> 00:03:51.726
by a friend to meditation for the first time,

84
00:03:51.726 --> 00:03:53.868
and I had a sesshin with a zen master

85
00:03:53.868 --> 00:03:56.368
and I started meditating, and I was enjoying

86
00:03:56.368 --> 00:03:59.688
going deeper and deeper in, but the deeper I got,

87
00:03:59.688 --> 00:04:02.668
the more I heard this distant kind of rumbling sound.

88
00:04:02.668 --> 00:04:04.608
First of all, I thought it maybe was the resonance

89
00:04:04.608 --> 00:04:07.268
of the cosmos or my kundalini arising,

90
00:04:07.268 --> 00:04:10.484
but the more I meditated, it became clearer and clearer

91
00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:14.104
it was the wailing of the suffering of humanity.

92
00:04:14.104 --> 00:04:18.695
And as I let that in, it was really hard, because I was

93
00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:21.516
enjoying being an athlete and learning in school

94
00:04:21.516 --> 00:04:23.126
and being outdoors and so forth, and all

95
00:04:23.126 --> 00:04:25.626
of a sudden, I'm hearing this inside me.

96
00:04:25.626 --> 00:04:29.907
And finally what I did was I made a commitment to

97
00:04:29.907 --> 00:04:33.167
dedicate my life to relieving that suffering,

98
00:04:33.167 --> 00:04:35.746
whether I was feeling it directly in the moment or not,

99
00:04:35.746 --> 00:04:38.586
to relieve that suffering of which we're all a part,

100
00:04:38.586 --> 00:04:42.566
and when I made that commitment, that sound went away

101
00:04:42.566 --> 00:04:46.647
and was replaced by just a sense of peace in the meditation.

102
00:04:46.647 --> 00:04:49.786
And the rest of my life has been a lot about

103
00:04:49.786 --> 00:04:52.667
trying to figure out what is in the way of our thriving,

104
00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:55.288
and what can we do about removing that

105
00:04:55.288 --> 00:04:56.967
because I have no doubt that life

106
00:04:56.967 --> 00:04:59.427
wants to work, you see it everywhere.

107
00:04:59.427 --> 00:05:01.368
<v Regina>And there was really, this has been a mystical</v>

108
00:05:01.368 --> 00:05:03.508
process for you really, from the beginning.

109
00:05:03.508 --> 00:05:05.847
I mean, as you show in the film, you had

110
00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:08.168
an event happen when you were a young fellow,

111
00:05:08.168 --> 00:05:12.448
just a young teenager, but then after that mystical event

112
00:05:12.448 --> 00:05:14.008
which I'm sure many people, if they haven't already

113
00:05:14.008 --> 00:05:16.488
seen the film will be going, they will be seeing it

114
00:05:16.488 --> 00:05:21.247
right after this, you were driven, I love it as you

115
00:05:21.247 --> 00:05:25.088
spoke about in one interview, you were driven to

116
00:05:25.088 --> 00:05:28.947
create this thing and you kept going into the labs,

117
00:05:28.947 --> 00:05:33.168
it was a physics lab in school in trying to

118
00:05:33.168 --> 00:05:34.867
create this thing, but you didn't even know what

119
00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:36.388
you were trying to create, and you used Close

120
00:05:36.388 --> 00:05:37.767
Encounters of the Third Kind where they're

121
00:05:37.767 --> 00:05:40.368
building the mountain with mashed potatoes (chuckles).

122
00:05:40.368 --> 00:05:43.807
And talk about this internal spiritual drive

123
00:05:43.807 --> 00:05:46.168
that happened after that, too.

124
00:05:46.168 --> 00:05:48.478
<v ->Well, I think when I look back on it,</v>

125
00:05:48.478 --> 00:05:50.869
what happened was as I was kind of coasting along

126
00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:54.448
in my early life, and then did these duck and cover drills,

127
00:05:54.448 --> 00:05:57.648
ducking under my desk as an elementary school kid,

128
00:05:57.648 --> 00:06:00.129
protecting my head as if that's gonna save me from

129
00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:02.689
a nuclear explosion, that was really the turning point

130
00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:05.519
where I thought, "OK, maybe the big folks don't

131
00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:07.732
"really know what's going on, or they don't have

132
00:06:07.732 --> 00:06:10.192
"my best interest in mind anyway."

133
00:06:10.192 --> 00:06:13.192
So, I think that that traumatized me in some way,

134
00:06:13.192 --> 00:06:16.292
so I think I was living with that fear and then,

135
00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:18.373
and I was looking into, what is energy?

136
00:06:18.373 --> 00:06:20.693
How can we relate to energy in a safe way?

137
00:06:20.693 --> 00:06:23.813
And I think that that inner question for me started

138
00:06:23.813 --> 00:06:26.993
to be answered with that experience on the school bus

139
00:06:26.993 --> 00:06:30.213
because I'm riding along looking at the light blinking

140
00:06:30.213 --> 00:06:33.333
through the trees, and suddenly I'm shown this gorgeous

141
00:06:33.333 --> 00:06:36.713
whirlpool vortex, and then there's an atom in it,

142
00:06:36.713 --> 00:06:39.224
there's a nucleus in the middle and these things whipping

143
00:06:39.224 --> 00:06:41.964
around the outside, and then it transforms into a solar

144
00:06:41.964 --> 00:06:44.484
system with the sun and the planets going around,

145
00:06:44.484 --> 00:06:45.484
and I thought, "Huh, that's kind

146
00:06:45.484 --> 00:06:46.904
"of an interesting correlation."

147
00:06:46.904 --> 00:06:48.844
But then all of a sudden, my whole body was taken

148
00:06:48.844 --> 00:06:52.264
over with this feeling of, "I'm that pattern too."

149
00:06:52.264 --> 00:06:54.564
You know, roughly halfway between the scale of something

150
00:06:54.564 --> 00:06:57.404
as small as an atom and as big as a solar system.

151
00:06:57.404 --> 00:06:59.804
And that's what really hooked me is I need to

152
00:06:59.804 --> 00:07:02.924
find out what that means, 'cause I really had no idea.

153
00:07:02.924 --> 00:07:04.068
<v Regina>As above, so below.</v>

154
00:07:04.068 --> 00:07:05.187
<v Foster>Yeah.</v>
<v Regina>I mean, this is</v>

155
00:07:05.187 --> 00:07:07.039
the, you saw the dynamic firsthand.

156
00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:07.919
<v ->Yeah.</v>

157
00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:09.359
<v Regina>And then talk about this thing that</v>

158
00:07:09.359 --> 00:07:10.982
you were trying to create in the labs, that you

159
00:07:10.982 --> 00:07:13.402
were driven to create, but you didn't know why.

160
00:07:13.402 --> 00:07:15.902
<v ->Yeah, well, I was an athlete and I would play drums</v>

161
00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:18.062
in the rock and roll band and everything, but any time

162
00:07:18.062 --> 00:07:20.603
that I could free up, I would go up to the

163
00:07:20.603 --> 00:07:23.102
physics lab 'cause I love physics and

164
00:07:23.102 --> 00:07:25.402
science, and I would just be building.

165
00:07:25.402 --> 00:07:27.932
And ultimately, and people would say, "What are you doing?"

166
00:07:27.932 --> 00:07:29.503
And I said, "I don't really know, but I'm building

167
00:07:29.503 --> 00:07:32.143
"a sculpture, and I'll let you know when it's done."

168
00:07:32.143 --> 00:07:35.483
Ultimately, I had gotten all these blocks of glass

169
00:07:35.483 --> 00:07:37.782
that refract light, and I had arranged them in such

170
00:07:37.782 --> 00:07:41.243
a way that I bent the light from a light generator

171
00:07:41.243 --> 00:07:43.522
so that it went around in this big circle and came back

172
00:07:43.522 --> 00:07:46.567
and basically is the ouroboros, it ate its own tale.

173
00:07:46.567 --> 00:07:50.987
So all of a sudden, I had a ring of light floating in space.

174
00:07:50.987 --> 00:07:54.166
And when I got that, it's like, "Oh, that's it."

175
00:07:54.166 --> 00:07:55.426
And people were like, "It's really

176
00:07:55.426 --> 00:07:56.607
"beautiful, but what is it?"

177
00:07:56.607 --> 00:07:58.547
And I said, "I don't know, but that's it."

178
00:07:58.547 --> 00:08:02.047
Now I can look back, you know, 35, 40 years ago,

179
00:08:02.047 --> 00:08:05.747
I was being shown how to manifest the fundamental

180
00:08:05.747 --> 00:08:09.348
energy pattern of the life force in the universe,

181
00:08:09.348 --> 00:08:12.048
which is this toroidal vortex.

182
00:08:12.048 --> 00:08:14.388
<v Regina>Yes, and that's represented throughout</v>

183
00:08:14.388 --> 00:08:16.228
the film in an absolutely beautiful way.

184
00:08:16.228 --> 00:08:17.430
I've got to complement you, the

185
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.528
production values are just stunning.

186
00:08:19.528 --> 00:08:21.568
<v ->Well, thank you, I'll pass that on to Liquid Buddha</v>

187
00:08:21.568 --> 00:08:23.452
Studios and Westwood Creek Productions,

188
00:08:23.452 --> 00:08:27.372
just two teams of really wonderful creative artists

189
00:08:27.372 --> 00:08:30.112
who were able to manifest these visions that I've been

190
00:08:30.112 --> 00:08:32.952
trying to talk about for decades, but suddenly when

191
00:08:32.952 --> 00:08:35.212
people can see it, the main thing is not only

192
00:08:35.212 --> 00:08:37.092
do people say, "Oh, that looks really beautiful,"

193
00:08:37.092 --> 00:08:40.252
they go, "It feels resonate with me, somehow I know

194
00:08:40.252 --> 00:08:41.992
"that pattern," and of course they do, because

195
00:08:41.992 --> 00:08:45.012
every atom, every molecule, the electromagnetic field

196
00:08:45.012 --> 00:08:47.859
around our body, it's all this torus shape.

197
00:08:47.859 --> 00:08:50.699
So, it's actually, they're recognizing who we are.

198
00:08:50.699 --> 00:08:53.380
<v Regina>And recognizing in themselves that yes, that kind</v>

199
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.000
of innate recognition of our own internal life force.

200
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.139
<v ->Yes, but it's a really cool thing to me is that it's</v>

201
00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:02.459
the only pattern that nature uses to sustain a healthy

202
00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:03.800
system at every scale throughout

203
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.821
the universe, as far as we can tell.

204
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:08.760
So, given that our evolutionary imperative is to figure

205
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.120
out how not to blow ourselves up and how not

206
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.620
to destroy the planet that's nurturing us,

207
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.640
it's really good news that we're being shown,

208
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.901
actually everywhere we look, what the

209
00:09:19.901 --> 00:09:21.920
blueprint for sustainability is.

210
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.241
But we're just learning how to see it, it turns out

211
00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:26.648
we've been shown it by ancient cultures, we're being

212
00:09:26.648 --> 00:09:28.768
shown it by advanced cultures in crop circles

213
00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:31.588
and so forth, it's emerging in physics, it's emerging

214
00:09:31.588 --> 00:09:35.468
in spirituality, so we're beginning to recognize the

215
00:09:35.468 --> 00:09:38.508
blueprint of how we can align our economic systems,

216
00:09:38.508 --> 00:09:42.069
our media systems, our energy access systems,

217
00:09:42.069 --> 00:09:45.088
even our consciousness systems with this fundamental

218
00:09:45.088 --> 00:09:47.249
pattern because it's who we are.

219
00:09:47.249 --> 00:09:48.269
<v Regina>And you're talking about</v>

220
00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:50.549
the work of many visionaries here.

221
00:09:50.549 --> 00:09:52.949
One of them is Nassim Haramein, who I think we

222
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:54.514
all adore, Nassim, and what he's

223
00:09:54.514 --> 00:09:56.393
brought to the forefront as well.

224
00:09:56.393 --> 00:09:59.033
And you are a visionary, you've been having these

225
00:09:59.033 --> 00:10:02.072
visions since you were a child, you've been in a position

226
00:10:02.072 --> 00:10:05.393
to be able to commit and dedicate yourself to finding

227
00:10:05.393 --> 00:10:09.012
solutions as a result of this, but when we go,

228
00:10:09.012 --> 00:10:11.095
when we're looking at these visions, oftentimes

229
00:10:11.095 --> 00:10:14.537
it's not just us that is involved in a vision, oftentimes

230
00:10:14.537 --> 00:10:16.868
there may be guidance, for example.

231
00:10:16.868 --> 00:10:19.508
You even go into the subject of extraterrestrials

232
00:10:19.508 --> 00:10:23.927
and extraterrestrial presence on earth in Thrive.

233
00:10:23.927 --> 00:10:28.927
What is your own experience with guidance,

234
00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:31.961
other-worldly forces, and so forth that have

235
00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:34.141
all helped you come to this more mature

236
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:36.361
view of where humanity's going?

237
00:10:36.361 --> 00:10:39.501
<v ->Well, thanks for the question, it's a really profound</v>

238
00:10:39.501 --> 00:10:42.721
inquiry to me that has been so touching for me

239
00:10:42.721 --> 00:10:46.101
and my path, and something for which I'm so grateful.

240
00:10:46.101 --> 00:10:50.554
An example is that, I have been, as Nassim was,

241
00:10:50.554 --> 00:10:53.553
gonna be independently obsessed with figuring out how

242
00:10:53.553 --> 00:10:57.193
nature manifests spirit into the material world.

243
00:10:57.193 --> 00:10:58.773
What are the dynamics, the geometries

244
00:10:58.773 --> 00:11:01.433
and so forth by which that works?

245
00:11:01.433 --> 00:11:04.874
And when I started really deeply inquiring into that,

246
00:11:04.874 --> 00:11:08.573
and getting specific with my questions, I invited

247
00:11:08.573 --> 00:11:11.056
Nassim into The Sequoia Symposium that some of us

248
00:11:11.056 --> 00:11:13.736
created, this think tank that went on for three and

249
00:11:13.736 --> 00:11:18.076
a half years, and during that whole process, the particular

250
00:11:18.076 --> 00:11:20.756
thing that I was trying to do was figure out, if you

251
00:11:20.756 --> 00:11:24.237
could fly down into an atom, what would it look like?

252
00:11:24.237 --> 00:11:26.118
Because we're all, that's what we're made of,

253
00:11:26.118 --> 00:11:28.618
and as I was studying the geometry of nature, I came to

254
00:11:28.618 --> 00:11:30.797
the conclusion that these two fundamental patterns

255
00:11:30.797 --> 00:11:34.997
that I talk about in the film, the torus, the whirlpool

256
00:11:34.997 --> 00:11:37.499
shape, and the vector equilibrium, which is the mother

257
00:11:37.499 --> 00:11:40.549
shape of all geometries, that if those two were

258
00:11:40.549 --> 00:11:42.891
really fundamental, then they must be there

259
00:11:42.891 --> 00:11:46.191
at the atomic level, so I started doing modeling with

260
00:11:46.191 --> 00:11:48.931
a team of physicists and computer scientists and

261
00:11:48.931 --> 00:11:51.490
so forth, started modeling according to 16

262
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.611
postulates that we had come up with, what the periodic

263
00:11:54.611 --> 00:11:57.350
table might look like according to these principles.

264
00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.911
And it turns out that it matches exactly the number

265
00:12:00.911 --> 00:12:02.351
of protons and neutrons in every

266
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:04.330
shell and explains why and so forth.

267
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.550
But the really interesting part to me was that I would

268
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.490
go along and do as much as I could do intellectually,

269
00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.671
and then I would just hit a wall, I couldn't think

270
00:12:13.671 --> 00:12:15.710
anymore, I would have to get up from my desk and I would

271
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:18.291
need to just go for a walk in the woods, or I would need

272
00:12:18.291 --> 00:12:21.791
to dance or put on music or meditate.

273
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:24.171
Sometimes before I would go to sleep at night, I would

274
00:12:24.171 --> 00:12:25.811
ask the question, "What about the

275
00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:27.471
"fourth shell and the inner rings?"

276
00:12:27.471 --> 00:12:30.176
And this and that, because I just couldn't do that

277
00:12:30.176 --> 00:12:34.096
with my rational mind, and I have a little tape recorder

278
00:12:34.096 --> 00:12:38.096
that I've carried for the last 15 years, because I started

279
00:12:38.096 --> 00:12:41.996
getting messages in response, and I told the universe,

280
00:12:41.996 --> 00:12:44.155
"If you give me the information that I need,

281
00:12:44.155 --> 00:12:46.296
"not only about the atom, but actually how to help

282
00:12:46.296 --> 00:12:49.295
"get us out of this lethal predicament that we're in,

283
00:12:49.295 --> 00:12:51.796
"I will record everything that seems coherent and I

284
00:12:51.796 --> 00:12:53.356
"will get it out to the world," and

285
00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:54.696
that's a lot of what Thrive is.

286
00:12:54.696 --> 00:12:57.336
I have hundreds of binders that contain, not only

287
00:12:57.336 --> 00:12:59.736
what I figured out and learned from other people,

288
00:12:59.736 --> 00:13:01.756
but also the information, I would wake up sometimes

289
00:13:01.756 --> 00:13:03.617
in the morning and I'd look at my recorder and

290
00:13:03.617 --> 00:13:06.716
there were 15 messages that I had woken up and recorded

291
00:13:06.716 --> 00:13:09.516
that I was being given in, what's, I was involved in

292
00:13:09.516 --> 00:13:12.676
brainwave science for a long time, more in the

293
00:13:12.676 --> 00:13:17.676
alpha-theta state, when you're aware but not

294
00:13:17.676 --> 00:13:20.021
pushing your thoughts, so you can actually receive.

295
00:13:20.021 --> 00:13:24.641
So, I'm clear from both my science and from my spiritual

296
00:13:24.641 --> 00:13:29.041
pursuits that what we think of as ourselves, this body

297
00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:32.101
or this particular personality or whatever, is simply

298
00:13:32.101 --> 00:13:33.840
part of an infinite continuum, like as you said,

299
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.681
"As above, so below," and as we learn to clear our channel,

300
00:13:38.681 --> 00:13:41.181
which is basically just relaxing our body, letting

301
00:13:41.181 --> 00:13:44.481
the emotions flow clearly and then both opening

302
00:13:44.481 --> 00:13:48.281
and focusing the mind simultaneously, gateways open,

303
00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:52.521
and then if you don't violate the process, you can ask for

304
00:13:52.521 --> 00:13:54.841
guidance in all different aspects of your life,

305
00:13:54.841 --> 00:13:57.541
and you know, most people hearing this will be

306
00:13:57.541 --> 00:14:01.161
going, "Yeah, I know that from my own personal experience."

307
00:14:01.161 --> 00:14:06.061
And I think this is the whole next frontier is not only

308
00:14:06.061 --> 00:14:09.301
out in space and the other beings that we're meeting there,

309
00:14:09.301 --> 00:14:11.961
but also in inner space, and those two are really one,

310
00:14:11.961 --> 00:14:14.601
because I think even the outer space travel and most

311
00:14:14.601 --> 00:14:18.481
of our ET contact is primarily going on, as Jacques Vallée

312
00:14:18.481 --> 00:14:21.841
says, at simply different frequency levels, most of

313
00:14:21.841 --> 00:14:24.360
the contact that we're having is in consciousness,

314
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.135
not metal ships that have necessarily come

315
00:14:27.135 --> 00:14:28.615
light years from somewhere else.

316
00:14:28.615 --> 00:14:29.975
<v Regina>Yes, that makes perfect sense, we're a</v>

317
00:14:29.975 --> 00:14:32.555
multi-dimensional being with another part that is

318
00:14:32.555 --> 00:14:34.995
infinite and infinitely connected, so of course

319
00:14:34.995 --> 00:14:37.515
that's where we're going to be making out greatest contact,

320
00:14:37.515 --> 00:14:41.115
however, that's carried a huge giggle factor up until now.

321
00:14:41.115 --> 00:14:44.315
And not only that, so has the work on the conspiracy

322
00:14:44.315 --> 00:14:47.715
carried a big giggle factor among the population at large,

323
00:14:47.715 --> 00:14:50.515
and yet here you come, it's almost as though a red

324
00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:53.694
carpet has been laid before you for your efforts

325
00:14:53.694 --> 00:14:57.595
to come in, modulate the messages in such a way

326
00:14:57.595 --> 00:15:00.815
that neither are giggle factors in this process

327
00:15:00.815 --> 00:15:02.214
you've gone through in your film,

328
00:15:02.214 --> 00:15:04.674
the project that's come from that.

329
00:15:04.674 --> 00:15:07.195
<v ->Well, I'm glad to hear that, because that took a lot</v>

330
00:15:07.195 --> 00:15:11.714
of work and a lot of resolve, because I can't tell you

331
00:15:11.714 --> 00:15:14.415
how many people told us, "OK, well you can do

332
00:15:14.415 --> 00:15:16.255
"conspiracy, but you can't do UFOs," or,

333
00:15:16.255 --> 00:15:18.935
"You can do free energy, but you can't really do liberty."

334
00:15:18.935 --> 00:15:22.354
On and on, and fortunately my wife and I were absolutely

335
00:15:22.354 --> 00:15:25.209
100% on the line from the beginning that we were here

336
00:15:25.209 --> 00:15:29.988
to tell the whole story, whatever that meant, and if we

337
00:15:29.988 --> 00:15:32.929
weren't willing to do, in our privileged position

338
00:15:32.929 --> 00:15:35.609
where we didn't have to hold on to a job and we

339
00:15:35.609 --> 00:15:39.089
were beyond caring more about our reputations than

340
00:15:39.089 --> 00:15:42.268
the truth, if we weren't gonna come out with that, who was?

341
00:15:42.268 --> 00:15:43.149
<v Regina>Exactly.</v>

342
00:15:43.149 --> 00:15:45.063
<v ->And we would rather come out with the truth, even if</v>

343
00:15:45.063 --> 00:15:47.522
it was risky or if people were gonna make fun of us,

344
00:15:47.522 --> 00:15:50.483
than to go cower on a beach with a Mai Tai somewhere

345
00:15:50.483 --> 00:15:53.045
while the world that our children and grandchildren

346
00:15:53.045 --> 00:15:56.066
are gonna try to grow up in is being destroyed,

347
00:15:56.066 --> 00:16:00.325
so I'm happy to say that our whole team came around

348
00:16:00.325 --> 00:16:02.825
as we were working on it to realize that when you

349
00:16:02.825 --> 00:16:05.585
hear the pieces all as a part of a whole, it's kind of

350
00:16:05.585 --> 00:16:08.125
like the pieces of the glass making up the ring, you

351
00:16:08.125 --> 00:16:11.525
can step back and go, "Ah, now I see, that connects

352
00:16:11.525 --> 00:16:14.245
"the dots for me, and it makes more sense than

353
00:16:14.245 --> 00:16:16.845
"the story I was told in school, the story I was

354
00:16:16.845 --> 00:16:19.787
"told in church, or by the corporate media."

355
00:16:19.787 --> 00:16:23.027
And now, with the internet and with people communicating

356
00:16:23.027 --> 00:16:26.486
as instantaneously and honesly as they are, just more

357
00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:30.656
and more of the truth is emerging rather than just a

358
00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:34.122
fashionable leaning, or a popular political stand,

359
00:16:34.122 --> 00:16:35.841
or something like that, and that to me is as

360
00:16:35.841 --> 00:16:37.421
thrilling as anything I can imagine.

361
00:16:37.421 --> 00:16:39.281
<v Regina>Absolutely, and you've been working on this,</v>

362
00:16:39.281 --> 00:16:41.222
you worked on it for a good six years, right?

363
00:16:41.222 --> 00:16:44.301
<v ->Eight years on the film, a lifetime on the research.</v>

364
00:16:44.301 --> 00:16:46.321
<v Regina>Yes, a lifetime on the research, and things</v>

365
00:16:46.321 --> 00:16:47.841
have changed during that period of time.

366
00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:51.061
When you first started researching the film, we were,

367
00:16:51.061 --> 00:16:54.402
in mass, in a different consciousness.

368
00:16:54.402 --> 00:16:57.004
Much has happened, I think that the fact that we've had

369
00:16:57.004 --> 00:17:01.003
so many difficulties economically globally has certainly

370
00:17:01.003 --> 00:17:04.383
softened, beaten down, whatever you want to call it,

371
00:17:04.383 --> 00:17:06.843
people to the point where new questions are starting

372
00:17:06.843 --> 00:17:09.504
to emerge, and a willingness to look at things maybe

373
00:17:09.504 --> 00:17:12.543
that we weren't willing to look at as a species has

374
00:17:12.543 --> 00:17:15.503
risen, so it seems like the timing on this has been

375
00:17:15.503 --> 00:17:17.504
impeccable, but what have you seen

376
00:17:17.504 --> 00:17:20.203
even in the last six months or so?

377
00:17:20.203 --> 00:17:21.884
I know off camera we were talking, you said you

378
00:17:21.884 --> 00:17:24.043
expected the first six months of release to be about

379
00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:27.933
people throwing stones and darts at you because of

380
00:17:27.933 --> 00:17:30.935
the conspiracy elements of it, that hasn't happened.

381
00:17:30.935 --> 00:17:33.695
So, let's just set that part aside, what have you

382
00:17:33.695 --> 00:17:35.955
seen emerging just the last six months and over

383
00:17:35.955 --> 00:17:39.175
the release of the film that is new energetically?

384
00:17:39.175 --> 00:17:41.675
<v ->Well, there were many times that we wished the film</v>

385
00:17:41.675 --> 00:17:44.795
were already out in terms of things that were happening

386
00:17:44.795 --> 00:17:46.795
in the world, in terms of how much it was costing,

387
00:17:46.795 --> 00:17:49.895
in terms of what hard work it was, and then we would

388
00:17:49.895 --> 00:17:53.915
be reminded again and again that we're part of a timing

389
00:17:53.915 --> 00:17:56.895
that's so much greater than our rational minds.

390
00:17:56.895 --> 00:17:59.935
And then when it actually came time to launch, it was

391
00:17:59.935 --> 00:18:02.835
so touching to see that first of all,

392
00:18:02.835 --> 00:18:04.975
what we had been working on wasn't irrelevant.

393
00:18:04.975 --> 00:18:05.976
Some people thought, "Well, is

394
00:18:05.976 --> 00:18:07.316
"this film still gonna be relevant?"

395
00:18:07.316 --> 00:18:09.397
Now, it's not only more relevant than ever, but it

396
00:18:09.397 --> 00:18:11.516
was more understandable than ever because people's

397
00:18:11.516 --> 00:18:15.396
lives are collapsing, the financial situation is collapsing,

398
00:18:15.396 --> 00:18:18.260
so people could recognize what we were saying in its

399
00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:23.197
correlation to daily life, but then, our biggest time

400
00:18:23.197 --> 00:18:26.720
of risk was between when we put the trailer out where

401
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.100
people knew what we were gonna be divulging,

402
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.439
and when the actual toothpaste was out of the tube with

403
00:18:31.439 --> 00:18:36.020
the film, and that's just when Occupy started happening.

404
00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.820
And for us to see that, 'cause we talk in the film

405
00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.738
and on the website about the importance of critical

406
00:18:41.738 --> 00:18:46.159
mass actions, it's a critical part of making a

407
00:18:46.159 --> 00:18:49.399
significant change, and then to see that it was

408
00:18:49.399 --> 00:18:52.198
already happening, it was happening in relation

409
00:18:52.198 --> 00:18:55.519
to the financial world as well as other things, and that

410
00:18:55.519 --> 00:18:59.099
it was the first global movement in history, was

411
00:18:59.099 --> 00:19:03.899
just, Kimberly and I just went, "Oh, thank you,"

412
00:19:03.899 --> 00:19:06.708
because we just felt so not alone with it, you know?

413
00:19:06.708 --> 00:19:08.328
Everybody was waking up to this, and we can simply

414
00:19:08.328 --> 00:19:11.128
offer, hopefully a helpful piece in there.

415
00:19:11.128 --> 00:19:16.127
And then my biggest concern was we did an internet

416
00:19:16.127 --> 00:19:18.877
release in 10 languages because we wanted this

417
00:19:18.877 --> 00:19:22.477
to go as broad across the globe as possible,

418
00:19:22.477 --> 00:19:24.997
and so that it couldn't get shut down in frivolous

419
00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:27.177
lawsuits, or something like that.

420
00:19:27.177 --> 00:19:30.936
And, so my biggest concern was that the internet

421
00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:33.217
would be shut down or taken over.

422
00:19:33.217 --> 00:19:35.897
You know, the corporations have tried, the government tried,

423
00:19:35.897 --> 00:19:39.876
the UN has tried, fortunately it hasn't worked so far.

424
00:19:39.876 --> 00:19:44.456
But I was still concerned about it, and then I get this

425
00:19:44.456 --> 00:19:47.816
email from the Occupy movement with their first trailer.

426
00:19:47.816 --> 00:19:50.237
I mean, not Occupy, sorry, Anonymous.

427
00:19:50.237 --> 00:19:53.856
And where they're describing what they stand for

428
00:19:53.856 --> 00:19:57.196
and how good they are at what they do and what

429
00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.636
they're willing to do to protect

430
00:19:58.636 --> 00:20:01.927
freedom and truth in the world.

431
00:20:01.927 --> 00:20:06.437
And again, it just made me cry to realize how

432
00:20:06.437 --> 00:20:08.817
interconnected we are and how consciousness itself

433
00:20:08.817 --> 00:20:12.596
is emerging, the planetary immune system is kicking in.

434
00:20:12.596 --> 00:20:14.896
And then, I was talking to a friend of mine who's one

435
00:20:14.896 --> 00:20:19.236
of the media leaders for Occupy

436
00:20:19.236 --> 00:20:21.356
LA, and she said they had just

437
00:20:21.356 --> 00:20:22.936
been visited by some of the Occupy

438
00:20:22.936 --> 00:20:25.876
people who were very enthusiastic about what they were

439
00:20:25.876 --> 00:20:30.196
doing, and assuring them of optimal protection.

440
00:20:30.196 --> 00:20:31.755
And she said, "Well, do you know about Thrive?

441
00:20:31.755 --> 00:20:33.895
"We're showing Thrive in our media tents," and so forth,

442
00:20:33.895 --> 00:20:36.015
and they said, "Yeah, we've checked out Thrive,

443
00:20:36.015 --> 00:20:38.615
"it's the real deal and we've got their backs also."

444
00:20:38.615 --> 00:20:43.015
So, it's a very moving time, I think for all of us

445
00:20:43.015 --> 00:20:46.875
to realize that those who are willing to stand for

446
00:20:46.875 --> 00:20:50.834
true freedom and integrity in our systems and so forth

447
00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:53.295
are not only not alone, we outnumber those who

448
00:20:53.295 --> 00:20:55.935
are trying to perpetrate the agenda against that

449
00:20:55.935 --> 00:20:58.975
by at least a million to one, and we've got truth, and

450
00:20:58.975 --> 00:21:01.695
we've got love, and we've got the life force on our side.

451
00:21:01.695 --> 00:21:04.195
<v Regina>Interestingly, on Coast to Coast a couple</v>

452
00:21:04.195 --> 00:21:06.875
of nights ago, the guest was Alex Jones,

453
00:21:06.875 --> 00:21:09.015
and Alex Jones was even saying this.

454
00:21:09.015 --> 00:21:10.934
You know, he has not been particularly optimistic

455
00:21:10.934 --> 00:21:13.514
about the future of humanity, as anyone who has followed

456
00:21:13.514 --> 00:21:17.893
him knows, but he was even saying that a critical time

457
00:21:17.893 --> 00:21:21.294
seems to be approaching where there are more good

458
00:21:21.294 --> 00:21:23.375
people at the higher levels that are

459
00:21:23.375 --> 00:21:25.574
working on behalf of humanity, than not.

460
00:21:25.574 --> 00:21:28.254
Well, that was huge, simply because it's Alex Jones

461
00:21:28.254 --> 00:21:32.194
saying it, and so many people are upset and angry that

462
00:21:32.194 --> 00:21:36.314
follow that particular perception of what life in the

463
00:21:36.314 --> 00:21:37.913
future is going to be like, you know,

464
00:21:37.913 --> 00:21:39.834
FEMA camps and everything else.

465
00:21:39.834 --> 00:21:41.634
Personally, I'm feeling all of those

466
00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:44.814
potentials having melted away, almost.

467
00:21:44.814 --> 00:21:46.353
Not to say we don't have a tough time

468
00:21:46.353 --> 00:21:49.554
coming, there's still gonna be bumps.

469
00:21:49.554 --> 00:21:53.262
Let's go to, you yourself came from a family that is

470
00:21:53.262 --> 00:21:56.363
privileged, you had the advantages of privilege.

471
00:21:56.363 --> 00:22:00.703
You have been among other very high-profile families

472
00:22:00.703 --> 00:22:03.934
who also have had the advantage of privilege, and

473
00:22:03.934 --> 00:22:06.575
one thing we're seeing here just with you sitting here,

474
00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:09.415
and we're hearing rumor of a new economic developments

475
00:22:09.415 --> 00:22:13.915
underneath the scene, is that there's this change of

476
00:22:13.915 --> 00:22:17.036
heart that's taking a place at the very, very highest

477
00:22:17.036 --> 00:22:20.055
levels of influence and wealth, and this

478
00:22:20.055 --> 00:22:21.975
I think gives a lot of people comfort.

479
00:22:21.975 --> 00:22:24.515
Can you talk about it from your own perspective?

480
00:22:24.515 --> 00:22:27.156
You also know some of the Rockefellers and so on,

481
00:22:27.156 --> 00:22:29.695
and what you're seeing in these families,

482
00:22:29.695 --> 00:22:31.195
the transition that's happening.

483
00:22:31.195 --> 00:22:33.895
<v ->Well, it's a really exciting time, and you know,</v>

484
00:22:33.895 --> 00:22:35.736
when I was in the science world, they used to say

485
00:22:35.736 --> 00:22:39.436
that the scientific paradigm, in physics in particular,

486
00:22:39.436 --> 00:22:41.595
moved along one funeral at a time.

487
00:22:41.595 --> 00:22:43.075
<v Regina>Yes, exactly. (chuckles)</v>

488
00:22:43.075 --> 00:22:45.146
<v ->And I don't think we need to wait for funerals, but</v>

489
00:22:45.146 --> 00:22:49.197
what I'm seeing and hearing in talking to some members

490
00:22:49.197 --> 00:22:52.296
of these families, some of them, I've known quite

491
00:22:52.296 --> 00:22:56.120
well for years, and some of them, I'm just meeting,

492
00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.040
is that they are aware of what their ancestors have

493
00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.480
done, they're in many cases ashamed of it and

494
00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.379
embarrassed about it, and really looking into the

495
00:23:04.379 --> 00:23:08.919
challenge of, what can we do to turn that legacy?

496
00:23:08.919 --> 00:23:13.559
It takes a lot to turn a giant ocean liner, and this old

497
00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:16.939
financial apparatus is that, and yet, when I talk in

498
00:23:16.939 --> 00:23:19.239
the movie about some of these families, the Rothschilds

499
00:23:19.239 --> 00:23:21.279
and the Rockefellers and the Morgans and so forth,

500
00:23:21.279 --> 00:23:23.959
I want to be very clear that that doesn't mean,

501
00:23:23.959 --> 00:23:26.260
I'm not making a generalization about anybody because

502
00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.659
of their name or their family, it's up to each one

503
00:23:29.659 --> 00:23:31.199
of us to look at what opportunities

504
00:23:31.199 --> 00:23:32.900
do we have, what is our legacy?

505
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.739
And then, what can we do with it?

506
00:23:34.739 --> 00:23:37.179
And some of these people have been approaching me

507
00:23:37.179 --> 00:23:40.639
about having constructive conversations and even

508
00:23:40.639 --> 00:23:42.580
televising these conversations about,

509
00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.840
how can we strategically be just the

510
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.059
flip-side of the old secret societies?

511
00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:51.319
How can we have strategic meetings about how

512
00:23:51.319 --> 00:23:54.859
to free up the global financial systems?

513
00:23:54.859 --> 00:23:58.172
And how to return justice and

514
00:23:58.172 --> 00:24:01.051
ecology to our lives?

515
00:24:01.051 --> 00:24:02.451
And then actually let the whole world

516
00:24:02.451 --> 00:24:03.811
be a part of those conversations.

517
00:24:03.811 --> 00:24:06.011
So, that's one of the things that I'm most excited

518
00:24:06.011 --> 00:24:09.651
about because with the current technologies like this,

519
00:24:09.651 --> 00:24:12.191
anybody on the planet, anywhere practically, can be

520
00:24:12.191 --> 00:24:15.271
a part of this conversation of the transition to the

521
00:24:15.271 --> 00:24:17.931
world that we all can sense is possible.

522
00:24:17.931 --> 00:24:20.352
And I'm more optimistic than ever that we are

523
00:24:20.352 --> 00:24:22.631
definitely able to make that transition.

524
00:24:22.631 --> 00:24:25.413
I'm convinced, like the song in Thrive says,

525
00:24:25.413 --> 00:24:27.452
that we already have what it takes the thrive,

526
00:24:27.452 --> 00:24:29.714
now we just need to make it happen.

527
00:24:29.714 --> 00:24:31.453
<v Regina>I feel exactly as you do, and I'm</v>

528
00:24:31.453 --> 00:24:33.853
very excited about this notion of conversation.

529
00:24:33.853 --> 00:24:37.552
Off camera, you were calling it a type of reconciliation

530
00:24:37.552 --> 00:24:39.032
that happens publicly, which is

531
00:24:39.032 --> 00:24:41.893
something that really lights my jets.

532
00:24:41.893 --> 00:24:45.752
The notion of getting factions on all sides around

533
00:24:45.752 --> 00:24:50.053
the table to have an honest and open discussion publicly

534
00:24:50.053 --> 00:24:52.332
about these crossover challenges.

535
00:24:52.332 --> 00:24:55.052
This is a huge transitional period, and I think everybody

536
00:24:55.052 --> 00:24:58.772
has their own idea of what needs to lead the way

537
00:24:58.772 --> 00:25:00.613
when you're in transition, I don't know that

538
00:25:00.613 --> 00:25:02.932
anyone knows the whole story or truth yet.

539
00:25:02.932 --> 00:25:05.912
However, you've been trying to put some pieces together

540
00:25:05.912 --> 00:25:10.493
as action plans, and again, with

541
00:25:10.493 --> 00:25:12.015
some of the new economy that may

542
00:25:12.015 --> 00:25:13.715
be emerging, it appears it may

543
00:25:13.715 --> 00:25:16.075
be emerging now, we're looking at something that is

544
00:25:16.075 --> 00:25:19.674
moving more toward the individual rather than

545
00:25:19.674 --> 00:25:21.934
the corporation or the government.

546
00:25:21.934 --> 00:25:24.415
Is this where you're going with it as well?

547
00:25:24.415 --> 00:25:29.155
<v ->Well, in my observation of the incredible power</v>

548
00:25:29.155 --> 00:25:32.395
that the inside of the torus has, if we realize

549
00:25:32.395 --> 00:25:35.715
what the torus is in nature, skilled scientists

550
00:25:35.715 --> 00:25:39.275
can build devices which actually access this so-called

551
00:25:39.275 --> 00:25:42.575
free energy right out of space in a clean and safe way.

552
00:25:42.575 --> 00:25:43.775
That's pretty exciting.

553
00:25:43.775 --> 00:25:45.315
That just comes out of the recognition

554
00:25:45.315 --> 00:25:46.894
of, how does nature work?

555
00:25:46.894 --> 00:25:49.855
My observation of the, where is

556
00:25:49.855 --> 00:25:54.568
the wholeness at the human level, is it's not the group.

557
00:25:54.568 --> 00:25:58.728
The group is an agglomeration of individuals,

558
00:25:58.728 --> 00:26:01.888
and if somebody starts violating you or me,

559
00:26:01.888 --> 00:26:05.508
we can know right away our wholeness is being violated.

560
00:26:05.508 --> 00:26:08.338
And it has been, I think, a trick of the elite

561
00:26:08.338 --> 00:26:13.338
for centuries to say whether it's the royalty,

562
00:26:13.338 --> 00:26:17.021
or it's the church, or it's the feudal lords, or it's

563
00:26:17.021 --> 00:26:19.481
the fascist leaders, or the communist leaders,

564
00:26:19.481 --> 00:26:22.080
or even the democratic leaders, to put the power

565
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.521
in the hands of a few and say, "For the sake

566
00:26:25.521 --> 00:26:28.361
"of the good, we're gonna violate individual

567
00:26:28.361 --> 00:26:30.162
"rights," simply doesn't work.

568
00:26:30.162 --> 00:26:33.182
Throughout history, that's always the seeds of tyranny.

569
00:26:33.182 --> 00:26:36.822
So, what we're really looking to do in the Thrive

570
00:26:36.822 --> 00:26:41.621
movement is try to offer helpful guidance in terms of

571
00:26:41.621 --> 00:26:45.282
solutions that are not politically based, but instead,

572
00:26:45.282 --> 00:26:48.002
based on principles, and what are those principles?

573
00:26:48.002 --> 00:26:52.482
And for me and after my whole life's quest, the core

574
00:26:52.482 --> 00:26:56.322
principle, for my thinking, that it can enable us to

575
00:26:56.322 --> 00:26:58.602
actually make it as a species, is what's called

576
00:26:58.602 --> 00:27:00.852
non-aggression, or non-violation.

577
00:27:00.852 --> 00:27:02.344
I don't get to hurt you or take your stuff,

578
00:27:02.344 --> 00:27:05.065
and you don't get to do that to me either.

579
00:27:05.065 --> 00:27:08.004
And if that's true, and that's the one thing I've

580
00:27:08.004 --> 00:27:10.365
found that everybody agrees to, whether or not

581
00:27:10.365 --> 00:27:12.624
they want to violate someone else, nobody wants

582
00:27:12.624 --> 00:27:15.805
to be violated themselves against their will.

583
00:27:15.805 --> 00:27:19.424
So, if that actually is the key navigating insight

584
00:27:19.424 --> 00:27:23.025
for humanity, then we need to look again at all our systems,

585
00:27:23.025 --> 00:27:26.785
starting with the government system, because virtually

586
00:27:26.785 --> 00:27:30.605
every government is based on the involuntary taking

587
00:27:30.605 --> 00:27:33.466
of your taxes, whether you like it or not.

588
00:27:33.466 --> 00:27:36.410
And that starts leading to crony capitalism and

589
00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.451
mores of aggression, and you know, police

590
00:27:38.451 --> 00:27:40.233
state, even internally and so forth.

591
00:27:40.233 --> 00:27:43.263
And in the 20th century alone, what the state as an

592
00:27:43.263 --> 00:27:47.162
entity was responsible for over 200 million deaths

593
00:27:47.162 --> 00:27:49.723
and the majority of those were within state boundaries.

594
00:27:49.723 --> 00:27:52.703
So, there's a lot of evidence that's not the right track

595
00:27:52.703 --> 00:27:54.663
even though we've been taught that

596
00:27:54.663 --> 00:27:57.163
the government is gonna save us.

597
00:27:57.163 --> 00:27:59.723
Democracy is way better than those other systems,

598
00:27:59.723 --> 00:28:03.364
but in my observation, it's still what's called

599
00:28:03.364 --> 00:28:06.183
a collectivist system, that gives rights to

600
00:28:06.183 --> 00:28:08.583
a few that other individuals don't have.

601
00:28:08.583 --> 00:28:11.683
So, a few end up with a monopoly on money, and

602
00:28:11.683 --> 00:28:14.623
a monopoly on force, and that's a lethal combination.

603
00:28:14.623 --> 00:28:17.603
It's taken us 200 years, well especially the last 100

604
00:28:17.603 --> 00:28:19.823
years since the Federal Reserve came in with

605
00:28:19.823 --> 00:28:22.843
the monopoly on money, but it has led to

606
00:28:22.843 --> 00:28:25.143
the brink of tyranny, we're on the verge

607
00:28:25.143 --> 00:28:28.083
of a, not only a national but a global police

608
00:28:28.083 --> 00:28:30.323
state as we describe in the movie.

609
00:28:30.323 --> 00:28:34.646
And for those who were doubting that, the recent

610
00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:38.286
enactment that Obama signed on New Year's Eve

611
00:28:38.286 --> 00:28:41.286
of the National Defense Authorization Act,

612
00:28:41.286 --> 00:28:43.906
if people check that out, you'll see that's kind of

613
00:28:43.906 --> 00:28:48.166
the last nail in the coffin of establishing

614
00:28:48.166 --> 00:28:50.366
the legality of a police state.

615
00:28:50.366 --> 00:28:53.046
And then Joe Lieberman has just proposed

616
00:28:53.046 --> 00:28:56.966
this, what is the EEA,

617
00:28:56.966 --> 00:28:59.450
it's the, is it the

618
00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:02.710
Enemy Extradition Authorization?

619
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:04.229
I can't remember the middle word right now,

620
00:29:04.229 --> 00:29:07.969
but anyway, it's a bill that allows people suspected

621
00:29:07.969 --> 00:29:11.030
of any terrorism support to lose their citizenship

622
00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:12.510
and be taken out of the country.

623
00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:15.570
So, it's a companion bill that basically allows the

624
00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:19.610
state, just by calling you a suspected terrorist.

625
00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:22.029
And simply even having a conversation like this

626
00:29:22.029 --> 00:29:24.829
comes under the category of dissident with the

627
00:29:24.829 --> 00:29:28.990
government plan, they can now legally take you away

628
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:32.509
without any cause, they can detain you indefinitely

629
00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:34.790
without a trial, they can even take you off to

630
00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:38.550
another country or assassinate you, and that's all legal.

631
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:41.769
So clearly, we're on the brink of something that has

632
00:29:41.769 --> 00:29:43.389
happened before in history, but

633
00:29:43.389 --> 00:29:45.130
people thought it can't happen here.

634
00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:46.989
Well, it is happening here and it's time for people

635
00:29:46.989 --> 00:29:50.109
to wake up, and as people are waking up, you know,

636
00:29:50.109 --> 00:29:53.149
Henry Ford said, "If people really understood the

637
00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:55.009
"banking system, there'd be a riot

638
00:29:55.009 --> 00:29:56.640
"in the street before morning."

639
00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.899
<v Regina>Yes, famous quote.</v>

640
00:29:57.899 --> 00:30:00.439
<v ->And Occupy is now writing this, you know,</v>

641
00:30:00.439 --> 00:30:03.799
driving here today, I was listening to ABC then

642
00:30:03.799 --> 00:30:06.560
CBS and then CNN on the radio, and the three

643
00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.860
main reports that I heard was first of all,

644
00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.119
the senate changed their mind on the SOPA Act,

645
00:30:12.119 --> 00:30:14.639
which was basically going to take over the internet.

646
00:30:14.639 --> 00:30:16.539
<v Regina>The people's pressure did matter.</v>

647
00:30:16.539 --> 00:30:19.059
<v ->Then Occupy has shut down Wells Fargo</v>

648
00:30:19.059 --> 00:30:21.439
and Bank of America in San Francisco, completely

649
00:30:21.439 --> 00:30:23.960
nonviolently, but they're getting the attention

650
00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.860
of even the major networks to have people ask,

651
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:30.020
"What are these banks actually doing?"

652
00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:34.240
And then, what was it, oh yeah, then there's a,

653
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.359
Occupy also has a simultaneous movement going on

654
00:30:36.359 --> 00:30:39.120
in Washington in front of the Supreme Court,

655
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.580
again completely nonviolently, challenging Citizens United,

656
00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.319
which basically officially turned the

657
00:30:44.319 --> 00:30:46.060
government over to the corporations.

658
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:50.339
So, it is emerging all over the planet, and the key

659
00:30:50.339 --> 00:30:54.430
thing is it's nonviolent, it has to stay nonviolent.

660
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:57.669
World War III is already on, it's just mostly economic,

661
00:30:57.669 --> 00:31:00.310
and if people realize that, then that's where we

662
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.909
get our leverage, because we can, in the same way

663
00:31:02.909 --> 00:31:05.910
Martin Luther King did, the same way that Nelson Mandela

664
00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:09.070
did, the same way that Ghandi did, we can use

665
00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:13.709
nonviolent withdrawing of participation.

666
00:31:13.709 --> 00:31:16.770
If we simply remove our money, remove our energy,

667
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:20.170
refuse to participate in these systems, they all

668
00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:22.990
depend on us for their survival, all of these power centers

669
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.950
of the military, the multinational corporations,

670
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:29.030
the media, the government, and so they will need

671
00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:33.170
to disappear or turn to go with natural human incentive.

672
00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:35.490
So, it's actually, even though it's probably the most

673
00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:38.271
dangerous time in human history, given our weapons

674
00:31:38.271 --> 00:31:40.770
of mass destruction and so forth, but it's also,

675
00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:43.771
I can't imagine a more exciting time to be alive

676
00:31:43.771 --> 00:31:46.990
because we get to participate in turning this in a direction

677
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:49.330
that our grandchildren can say, "Yeah, you know,

678
00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:50.890
"our ancestors stood up for this

679
00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:52.490
"when they saw what was going on."

680
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:53.750
<v Regina>And actually, if you look at it from</v>

681
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:56.090
a purely energetic point of view, it makes sense.

682
00:31:56.090 --> 00:32:00.150
Here you have these incredibly dark agendas that

683
00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:02.750
are being sealed and put into place, but for every

684
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:04.990
action, there's an equal and opposite reaction,

685
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:08.270
and the reaction to that is this incredible source

686
00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:11.870
of initiative and light that's pouring in to answer it.

687
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:15.650
And right now, it seems to be a consensus that the tide

688
00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:20.413
of those individuals, of you, of the Occupy

689
00:32:20.413 --> 00:32:22.696
Wall Street, young people of us, and many,

690
00:32:22.696 --> 00:32:25.856
many, many others, is really the tide that's turning

691
00:32:25.856 --> 00:32:30.156
and going to overcome the darker agenda.

692
00:32:30.156 --> 00:32:33.576
We talked off camera, there's this incredible feeling

693
00:32:33.576 --> 00:32:37.518
of, I don't like the word hope,

694
00:32:37.518 --> 00:32:38.718
hope's not a good word--

695
00:32:38.718 --> 00:32:39.798
<v ->But it's grounded hope.</v>

696
00:32:39.798 --> 00:32:41.999
<v Regina>Grounded hope that is now</v>

697
00:32:41.999 --> 00:32:45.359
becoming very visceral, just that feeling that you wake

698
00:32:45.359 --> 00:32:47.978
up with in the morning where those things that

699
00:32:47.978 --> 00:32:50.918
dogged us even a year or two ago at large,

700
00:32:50.918 --> 00:32:52.838
that energy seems to be dissipating.

701
00:32:52.838 --> 00:32:54.218
Are you feeling that as well?

702
00:32:54.218 --> 00:32:58.730
<v ->Absolutely, and I am so thrilled</v>

703
00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:01.870
every day to be literally getting hundreds of communications

704
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:05.140
from all over the world, first of all just thanking us

705
00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.182
for Thrive because it wraps the picture together

706
00:33:08.182 --> 00:33:11.002
so people can understand it very quickly, and in a

707
00:33:11.002 --> 00:33:12.992
package where they can feel safe giving it to their

708
00:33:12.992 --> 00:33:17.433
spouse, giving it to their work partners and so forth,

709
00:33:17.433 --> 00:33:19.715
spreading it in their community, bringing people in.

710
00:33:19.715 --> 00:33:21.495
So, people are catching on very

711
00:33:21.495 --> 00:33:24.095
fast to what's actually going on.

712
00:33:24.095 --> 00:33:26.095
What I'm most excited about, and the energy that

713
00:33:26.095 --> 00:33:30.175
you're talking about that's emerging, in Occupy

714
00:33:30.175 --> 00:33:31.856
and the Arab Spring all over the

715
00:33:31.856 --> 00:33:34.977
place, is this energy for solutions?

716
00:33:34.977 --> 00:33:38.136
And you asked a minute ago about this template that

717
00:33:38.136 --> 00:33:43.076
we're offering into the emerging movement right now,

718
00:33:43.076 --> 00:33:44.917
and let me say a little bit about that, because this

719
00:33:44.917 --> 00:33:49.397
is what I think is most highly leveraged right now,

720
00:33:49.397 --> 00:33:52.416
is that one of the things that we offer in the film

721
00:33:52.416 --> 00:33:55.336
is what we call the sector navigator, and it's basically

722
00:33:55.336 --> 00:34:00.177
a whole systems device that has 12 spheres

723
00:34:00.177 --> 00:34:02.476
representing all the sectors, major sectors of human

724
00:34:02.476 --> 00:34:05.137
endeavor, and then the center one is world view,

725
00:34:05.137 --> 00:34:08.696
because we see everything that we do through our world view.

726
00:34:08.696 --> 00:34:12.857
And this is the geometry that Bucky Fuller identified

727
00:34:12.857 --> 00:34:15.476
as the core structure of nature,

728
00:34:15.476 --> 00:34:17.456
it's what stabilizes the system.

729
00:34:17.456 --> 00:34:21.327
So, if we can actually realize that all of these areas,

730
00:34:21.327 --> 00:34:23.817
media and education and health and science

731
00:34:23.817 --> 00:34:25.797
and governings and so forth, if we can realize

732
00:34:25.797 --> 00:34:29.038
those are all part of a whole, and if we can have them

733
00:34:29.038 --> 00:34:31.278
working in harmony with one another,

734
00:34:31.278 --> 00:34:33.478
we've got a shot at turning the thing around

735
00:34:33.478 --> 00:34:36.337
in a way that I haven't seen previously.

736
00:34:36.337 --> 00:34:41.337
And we actually had a test case of this several years ago.

737
00:34:41.337 --> 00:34:44.202
I live in Santa Cruz and they started with these planes

738
00:34:44.202 --> 00:34:47.781
coming out of Monterey and spraying toxic chemicals--

739
00:34:47.781 --> 00:34:49.141
<v Regina>For the brown, some kind of brown</v>

740
00:34:49.141 --> 00:34:50.042
fruit fly, or--
<v Foster>Light brown</v>

741
00:34:50.042 --> 00:34:51.801
apple moth, and they wouldn't tell us what

742
00:34:51.801 --> 00:34:54.942
was in it, there was no damage coming from this moth,

743
00:34:54.942 --> 00:34:57.661
and so I got very suspicious, and I started following the

744
00:34:57.661 --> 00:35:01.162
money, and it turned out that it was a George Bush

745
00:35:01.162 --> 00:35:03.821
personal earmark that went then through Homeland

746
00:35:03.821 --> 00:35:07.901
Security and through the USDA and the CEFA, and then

747
00:35:07.901 --> 00:35:11.242
authorized the spraying of the most progressive communities

748
00:35:11.242 --> 00:35:15.132
in the country nine months a year for up to 10 years

749
00:35:15.132 --> 00:35:16.522
with this toxic chemical.
<v Regina>It was awful.</v>

750
00:35:16.522 --> 00:35:20.323
<v ->So fortunately, we got together and used this</v>

751
00:35:20.323 --> 00:35:23.666
very sector model so that the lawyers and the

752
00:35:23.666 --> 00:35:26.186
artists and the media experts and so forth all came

753
00:35:26.186 --> 00:35:29.486
together, and knew that they could contribute what they

754
00:35:29.486 --> 00:35:32.267
were passionate about and what they did best,

755
00:35:32.267 --> 00:35:35.126
and know that the other parts were gonna be handled also.

756
00:35:35.126 --> 00:35:38.297
And then we had a toroidal communication system where

757
00:35:38.297 --> 00:35:41.377
the teams could send representatives into a steering

758
00:35:41.377 --> 00:35:42.657
committee in the middle and then the

759
00:35:42.657 --> 00:35:45.118
information would keep coming back out.

760
00:35:45.118 --> 00:35:49.097
So, it was really a toroidal rather than a pyramidal system.

761
00:35:49.097 --> 00:35:50.977
Long short of it, it worked, and within

762
00:35:50.977 --> 00:35:53.377
six months, we were able to stop that.

763
00:35:53.377 --> 00:35:57.079
So, what we're offering now is to invite people to use

764
00:35:57.079 --> 00:36:00.178
that same model, so when you're looking at the vastness

765
00:36:00.178 --> 00:36:02.878
of the challenge of turning this around, and if you have

766
00:36:02.878 --> 00:36:07.698
the thought, "Well, what can I do as one person?"

767
00:36:07.698 --> 00:36:11.328
If you identify your own coordinates, so first of all, we

768
00:36:11.328 --> 00:36:15.662
invite people to write down, what is your purpose in life?

769
00:36:15.662 --> 00:36:18.808
So that you can line everything with that, and then second,

770
00:36:18.808 --> 00:36:20.771
look at the sector navigator and ask,

771
00:36:20.771 --> 00:36:22.530
what's the sector that I'm most drawn to?

772
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:25.091
Is it media, is it education, is it economics?

773
00:36:25.091 --> 00:36:27.710
Whatever, and then ask yourself, what's the level

774
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:29.451
of engagement that I'm most drawn to?

775
00:36:29.451 --> 00:36:32.232
Is it meeting immediate needs in a soup kitchen or,

776
00:36:32.232 --> 00:36:34.671
you know, Doctors Without Borders, or something like that,

777
00:36:34.671 --> 00:36:37.432
or is it making systemic change?

778
00:36:37.432 --> 00:36:41.132
Or is it actually working on the consciousness shift

779
00:36:41.132 --> 00:36:43.652
from which systemic change comes, which then

780
00:36:43.652 --> 00:36:47.032
improves the life of everyone on the ground?

781
00:36:47.032 --> 00:36:49.832
And when you identify which one you're most drawn to,

782
00:36:49.832 --> 00:36:52.734
then you can relax into, "OK, it's enough to just

783
00:36:52.734 --> 00:36:55.433
"do my part because the other levels are gonna be handled."

784
00:36:55.433 --> 00:36:57.095
So many activists just burn themselves

785
00:36:57.095 --> 00:37:00.275
out by trying to do it all.

786
00:37:00.275 --> 00:37:03.595
Then on our website, we have specific actions that we

787
00:37:03.595 --> 00:37:06.355
recommend and also tools as to how to take care of

788
00:37:06.355 --> 00:37:08.975
yourself emotionally, how to resolve conflict

789
00:37:08.975 --> 00:37:10.675
in groups, and how to keep your life in

790
00:37:10.675 --> 00:37:12.595
balance while you're moving forward.

791
00:37:12.595 --> 00:37:14.875
So, what we're trying to do is provide a framework

792
00:37:14.875 --> 00:37:19.235
and tools that can empower people to self-create,

793
00:37:19.235 --> 00:37:22.299
because Kimberly and I have no interest whatsoever in

794
00:37:22.299 --> 00:37:25.879
trying to lead or centralize power over some movement.

795
00:37:25.879 --> 00:37:28.879
It's never worked, it would be offensive to even try

796
00:37:28.879 --> 00:37:30.439
and that's not what nature does.

797
00:37:30.439 --> 00:37:32.359
When you go into the woods and try to find

798
00:37:32.359 --> 00:37:34.409
the boss, you know, good luck.

799
00:37:34.409 --> 00:37:37.560
And so what we envisioned is actually what's

800
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:41.321
happening, it's so moving that there are already

801
00:37:41.321 --> 00:37:44.521
hundreds of Thrive groups in communities,

802
00:37:44.521 --> 00:37:47.120
in cities, in countries around the world that

803
00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:50.121
are simply self-creating, and they're engaged as

804
00:37:50.121 --> 00:37:51.572
so, what are the principles, what are the

805
00:37:51.572 --> 00:37:53.252
organizational tools, and so forth?

806
00:37:53.252 --> 00:37:56.232
And then we're operating as a hub to keep them in

807
00:37:56.232 --> 00:37:57.933
communication with one another and so forth,

808
00:37:57.933 --> 00:38:01.492
and in association with Occupy and you know,

809
00:38:01.492 --> 00:38:04.932
so many other groups that are doing such great work.

810
00:38:04.932 --> 00:38:08.953
So, what I'm seeing is a decentralized self-creating

811
00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:12.153
emerging movement, and to my mind, that's unstoppable.

812
00:38:12.153 --> 00:38:13.393
<v Regina>And that's how nature works.</v>

813
00:38:13.393 --> 00:38:14.853
<v ->Exactly, that's why.</v>

814
00:38:14.853 --> 00:38:17.492
<v Regina>Yes, absolutely, and to me,</v>

815
00:38:17.492 --> 00:38:20.293
as beautiful as the film is and as well done as

816
00:38:20.293 --> 00:38:22.412
the film is, it's really the aftermath

817
00:38:22.412 --> 00:38:25.512
of the film that is creating the change.

818
00:38:25.512 --> 00:38:28.512
The power is in the action that people are inspired

819
00:38:28.512 --> 00:38:31.213
to by the film, and as you just said a moment ago,

820
00:38:31.213 --> 00:38:35.155
and you say in the film, it's this notion that

821
00:38:35.155 --> 00:38:37.705
individuals, I just wrote a blog about it, I think

822
00:38:37.705 --> 00:38:41.897
yesterday, about having opportunity here to begin

823
00:38:41.897 --> 00:38:44.378
dreaming again, to find their own passion.

824
00:38:44.378 --> 00:38:46.338
What is it that I can contribute?

825
00:38:46.338 --> 00:38:49.177
Because it lights my jets to contribute that.

826
00:38:49.177 --> 00:38:51.997
And that goes for beyond just the Thrive movement,

827
00:38:51.997 --> 00:38:56.517
that goes into revitalizing entire populations again.

828
00:38:56.517 --> 00:38:58.627
<v ->Exactly.</v>

829
00:38:58.627 --> 00:39:02.283
This is the period whereas Catherine Austin Fitts says

830
00:39:02.283 --> 00:39:06.307
in the movie, where we're learning how to spend

831
00:39:06.307 --> 00:39:09.631
Monday through Friday making money saving the planet,

832
00:39:09.631 --> 00:39:13.161
and then on the weekend, you go to the beach.

833
00:39:13.161 --> 00:39:14.893
Instead of doing things you don't want to do

834
00:39:14.893 --> 00:39:17.353
Monday through Friday and then trying to scramble

835
00:39:17.353 --> 00:39:21.588
to save the planet, meanwhile burning yourself out.

836
00:39:21.588 --> 00:39:25.765
If we look at the investments that have actually

837
00:39:25.765 --> 00:39:29.825
been surviving the best, not counting the banks, which

838
00:39:29.825 --> 00:39:34.825
are being propped up by false foundation, there are

839
00:39:34.825 --> 00:39:38.682
actually the companies through people like Catherine

840
00:39:38.682 --> 00:39:41.673
Austin Fitts and Paul Hawken and others who have researched

841
00:39:41.673 --> 00:39:44.205
this and disclosed the companies that are actually

842
00:39:44.205 --> 00:39:46.986
operating in a way that takes care of people, takes care

843
00:39:46.986 --> 00:39:49.246
of the environment and creates products which serve

844
00:39:49.246 --> 00:39:50.588
people, those are the ones that are

845
00:39:50.588 --> 00:39:53.289
actually doing the best, even in the financial collapse.

846
00:39:53.289 --> 00:39:55.848
So, it bodes well for the future where we can actually

847
00:39:55.848 --> 00:39:59.809
exchange value in an open way while healing.

848
00:39:59.809 --> 00:40:01.948
<v Regina>And it sounds like free energy, or</v>

849
00:40:01.948 --> 00:40:05.109
nearly free energy is right on the horizon anyway.

850
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:07.372
This is popping up all over and we all know the

851
00:40:07.372 --> 00:40:09.534
stories, I've dealt with people, you've dealt with people

852
00:40:09.534 --> 00:40:12.354
who've had their labs broken into and smashed up,

853
00:40:12.354 --> 00:40:16.454
their patents either rejected or stolen outright,

854
00:40:16.454 --> 00:40:18.554
so we know the journey they've been through,

855
00:40:18.554 --> 00:40:20.554
it's been a dangerous one to be an innovator

856
00:40:20.554 --> 00:40:23.474
in the world of energy, but it seems even there,

857
00:40:23.474 --> 00:40:25.994
we're now starting to see the light shining through

858
00:40:25.994 --> 00:40:30.193
and even from, again, intuitive sources from beyond,

859
00:40:30.193 --> 00:40:34.994
the word keeps coming, you're right on the cusp of it,

860
00:40:34.994 --> 00:40:37.076
it's right around the corner now, so they're not gonna

861
00:40:37.076 --> 00:40:39.209
be able to keep their fingers in those dikes

862
00:40:39.209 --> 00:40:42.348
and plugging those possibilities any longer, it sounds like.

863
00:40:42.348 --> 00:40:44.488
<v ->This is the strongest, single reaction that</v>

864
00:40:44.488 --> 00:40:47.048
we're getting from all over the planet in relation

865
00:40:47.048 --> 00:40:49.309
to Thrive is, what can I do to help

866
00:40:49.309 --> 00:40:51.068
that free energy become available?

867
00:40:51.068 --> 00:40:52.988
Because on a very practical level, obviously it would

868
00:40:52.988 --> 00:40:57.688
change the economic situation, the access to heat

869
00:40:57.688 --> 00:41:00.548
and electricity to cook with and so forth,

870
00:41:00.548 --> 00:41:02.828
just dramatically and very quickly.

871
00:41:02.828 --> 00:41:05.629
And a lot of people still think, and understandably,

872
00:41:05.629 --> 00:41:08.788
I appreciate really healthy skepticism, a lot of

873
00:41:08.788 --> 00:41:11.548
people think, "Well, you know, it couldn't be

874
00:41:11.548 --> 00:41:13.348
"real, it must be a bunch of hoaxers."

875
00:41:13.348 --> 00:41:16.808
Well, in my research, I've never seen the government

876
00:41:16.808 --> 00:41:21.428
crack down brutally on hoaxers, they don't

877
00:41:21.428 --> 00:41:24.271
bother unless it's real, and I have had the good

878
00:41:24.271 --> 00:41:26.830
fortune to visit some of these labs, I've seen

879
00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:30.130
these devices working, then I hear later on the labs

880
00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:33.171
were raided and the people were shut down,

881
00:41:33.171 --> 00:41:36.650
they were gag ordered, and it's really unsafe to do

882
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:39.490
that right now, and that's the only reason we don't have it.

883
00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:43.193
However, as Brian O'Leary says in the movie, this is

884
00:41:43.193 --> 00:41:45.634
in hundreds of labs all over the world.

885
00:41:45.634 --> 00:41:47.933
More and more people are learning how to do it,

886
00:41:47.933 --> 00:41:51.914
and the people have been approaching us,

887
00:41:51.914 --> 00:41:55.470
scientists have been sending us great papers, inventors have

888
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:58.782
been saying, "I appreciate your courage in bringing

889
00:41:58.782 --> 00:42:01.144
"this out, here's what I've been working on,"

890
00:42:01.144 --> 00:42:04.163
and potential investors or philanthropists are approaching

891
00:42:04.163 --> 00:42:06.603
us saying, "We want to be a part of that critical mass

892
00:42:06.603 --> 00:42:09.443
"action," and we're not gonna make any moves in

893
00:42:09.443 --> 00:42:13.223
that direction until there's enough science, enough

894
00:42:13.223 --> 00:42:15.444
technology, and enough money to actually

895
00:42:15.444 --> 00:42:17.583
bring it out safely in cooperation with

896
00:42:17.583 --> 00:42:19.344
lots of groups all over the world.

897
00:42:19.344 --> 00:42:22.104
But that too, is unstoppable because it's real,

898
00:42:22.104 --> 00:42:25.624
it's true, it's needed, and the people who are suppressing

899
00:42:25.624 --> 00:42:28.203
that are of very few, and they're getting exposed.

900
00:42:28.203 --> 00:42:29.445
<v Regina>Yeah, they're getting exposed,</v>

901
00:42:29.445 --> 00:42:31.523
they can't hold that back any longer.

902
00:42:31.523 --> 00:42:35.115
Let me ask you this, if you were to just look

903
00:42:35.115 --> 00:42:37.535
forward a little into the future and you are a visionary,

904
00:42:37.535 --> 00:42:38.737
and you've obviously spent a lot of

905
00:42:38.737 --> 00:42:41.457
time doing this, what is your utopian

906
00:42:41.457 --> 00:42:45.136
view of our our coming reality look like?

907
00:42:45.136 --> 00:42:47.337
And even though the word utopian isn't appropriate

908
00:42:47.337 --> 00:42:50.138
anymore, maybe it simply is just what will be.

909
00:42:50.138 --> 00:42:54.037
<v ->Yeah, I love thinking that way, and one of the reasons</v>

910
00:42:54.037 --> 00:42:58.284
that I portrayed some of that in the film is that

911
00:42:58.284 --> 00:43:02.424
I have been aware of the agenda's effort to dumb people

912
00:43:02.424 --> 00:43:04.884
down, discourage them, make them afraid, put them in debt

913
00:43:04.884 --> 00:43:07.164
and so forth, because they're easier to control that way.

914
00:43:07.164 --> 00:43:10.003
But the very first filming that we did for Thrive was we

915
00:43:10.003 --> 00:43:13.510
interviewed 20 young people, along with Vandana Shiva

916
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:15.872
and Elisabet Sahtouris, at an ecology

917
00:43:15.872 --> 00:43:18.212
conference near Santa Barbara.

918
00:43:18.212 --> 00:43:21.816
And this was a conference of young, bright college

919
00:43:21.816 --> 00:43:23.336
people, all of whom are interested

920
00:43:23.336 --> 00:43:26.776
in restoring the ecology of the planet.

921
00:43:26.776 --> 00:43:29.678
I interviewed 20 of them and asked them

922
00:43:29.678 --> 00:43:32.497
a couple of questions, one of which was,

923
00:43:32.497 --> 00:43:36.137
"Tell me your vision of how it could be on planet earth."

924
00:43:36.137 --> 00:43:39.589
And out of 20 educated, motivated people, only

925
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:41.851
two of them could come up with a positive

926
00:43:41.851 --> 00:43:44.030
vision for the planet for the future.

927
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:46.710
And I was shocked, and that's when

928
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:50.405
I realized, "Wow, this is really needed."

929
00:43:50.405 --> 00:43:53.964
And so my vision of what it could be like

930
00:43:53.964 --> 00:43:57.204
is all based around wholeness, all you have to do

931
00:43:57.204 --> 00:43:59.424
is take the word wholeness, which is symbolize

932
00:43:59.424 --> 00:44:01.485
as the torus because that's how nature does it,

933
00:44:01.485 --> 00:44:03.225
and then just apply it to every system.

934
00:44:03.225 --> 00:44:05.224
You apply that to an economic system and all

935
00:44:05.224 --> 00:44:06.604
of a sudden, you've got honest money,

936
00:44:06.604 --> 00:44:08.424
you've got honest trades, you've got a true free

937
00:44:08.424 --> 00:44:11.515
market in sound currency and that type of thing.

938
00:44:11.515 --> 00:44:14.426
I worked with Catherine and with Bill Still

939
00:44:14.426 --> 00:44:16.806
and Hazel Henderson and others working out the numbers

940
00:44:16.806 --> 00:44:19.666
on what it would be like, and very quickly they estimate

941
00:44:19.666 --> 00:44:22.146
that it would be between three and 10 times

942
00:44:22.146 --> 00:44:24.087
the amount of assets and income that all of you

943
00:44:24.087 --> 00:44:27.246
have right now working as hard as you do.

944
00:44:27.246 --> 00:44:29.967
You'd have three to 10 times as much as you

945
00:44:29.967 --> 00:44:32.208
have currently working the same or less.

946
00:44:32.208 --> 00:44:34.368
So, first of all, picture the change in your life,

947
00:44:34.368 --> 00:44:36.668
debts gone, you own your house, your car, you're

948
00:44:36.668 --> 00:44:39.069
choosing where you want to send your kids to school,

949
00:44:39.069 --> 00:44:41.048
now you're saving money, you're investing money,

950
00:44:41.048 --> 00:44:43.348
you're helping people out and so forth, so it starts

951
00:44:43.348 --> 00:44:46.529
with a prosperous society, and out of that,

952
00:44:46.529 --> 00:44:48.669
people are learning that wholeness when it comes

953
00:44:48.669 --> 00:44:51.090
to health is you start with whole food.

954
00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:56.051
You get the GMO poisons out of our systems,

955
00:44:56.051 --> 00:45:00.310
and you go back to a natural polycultured growing

956
00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:02.693
that grows healthy, whole foods.

957
00:45:02.693 --> 00:45:06.736
And then you look at the political system, and if

958
00:45:06.736 --> 00:45:10.356
there is a political system, it's only there to protect

959
00:45:10.356 --> 00:45:14.917
individual rights and whatever we need to share in common.

960
00:45:14.917 --> 00:45:18.017
And it's done all very openly and transparently.

961
00:45:18.017 --> 00:45:20.956
And then you look at a media system, and media,

962
00:45:20.956 --> 00:45:23.117
anybody could create a media system as they want

963
00:45:23.117 --> 00:45:25.877
to do their corporate propaganda, that's fine,

964
00:45:25.877 --> 00:45:28.510
that's available too, but people are getting sophisticated

965
00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:31.690
enough to where they would spend their money on

966
00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:35.330
getting independent input that was actually based

967
00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:37.490
on the reality that was going on, because if we

968
00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:40.071
have the information that we need, we can

969
00:45:40.071 --> 00:45:41.932
make the wise decisions that we make.

970
00:45:41.932 --> 00:45:45.251
So, I picture, actually, someone guided a meditation

971
00:45:45.251 --> 00:45:47.994
once that I participated in, we went for a full hour,

972
00:45:47.994 --> 00:45:52.119
we just imagined actually walking down the street.

973
00:45:52.119 --> 00:45:53.679
You know, you're in a city or you're in a town

974
00:45:53.679 --> 00:45:56.220
or you're going into people's houses, and virtually

975
00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.220
everywhere you look, people are healthy, they're

976
00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:01.820
experiencing being in loving relationship,

977
00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.121
and connectedness with nature.

978
00:46:03.121 --> 00:46:05.960
Can you image what that would actually feel like?

979
00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.901
And so, I could go into lots of details, but I know

980
00:46:08.901 --> 00:46:12.460
that that's possible and it's not even that far away.

981
00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:13.643
<v Regina>I share your vision,</v>

982
00:46:13.643 --> 00:46:17.002
and thank you so much for your time.

983
00:46:17.002 --> 00:46:18.984
I shouldn't say that, is there any one other thing

984
00:46:18.984 --> 00:46:21.268
that was so beautiful, I was ready to just go

985
00:46:21.268 --> 00:46:23.031
and daydream myself, is there any

986
00:46:23.031 --> 00:46:26.304
final statement you'd like to make?

987
00:46:28.352 --> 00:46:30.073
<v ->Well sometimes, I come across people who are</v>

988
00:46:30.073 --> 00:46:32.313
very resigned and discouraged, or they've

989
00:46:32.313 --> 00:46:34.773
learned somewhat about the agenda that's going

990
00:46:34.773 --> 00:46:37.813
on and they get afraid and just in shock,

991
00:46:37.813 --> 00:46:39.773
and I really understand that, I've been through a lot

992
00:46:39.773 --> 00:46:43.013
of that myself, but I guess my final message would

993
00:46:43.013 --> 00:46:46.234
be to people, I know who you are, anyone

994
00:46:46.234 --> 00:46:49.613
inhabiting a body on this planet was the champion

995
00:46:49.613 --> 00:46:53.853
in a swimming race of between 60 and 600 million

996
00:46:53.853 --> 00:46:57.094
sperm looking for an egg, so you were that champion.

997
00:46:57.094 --> 00:46:59.763
So, whatever's happened to you that has had you

998
00:46:59.763 --> 00:47:04.763
forget that kind of drive and integrity that you had,

999
00:47:04.764 --> 00:47:07.314
I know each of you is a champion, and we've got

1000
00:47:07.314 --> 00:47:10.295
seven billion of those that are now getting access

1001
00:47:10.295 --> 00:47:15.295
to the tools to make the changes and remembering who we are.

1002
00:47:15.304 --> 00:47:20.297
Nature's desire to thrive expresses itself as truth,

1003
00:47:20.297 --> 00:47:23.577
it expresses itself as love, and in creative effectiveness,

1004
00:47:23.577 --> 00:47:25.818
and that's what we're moving into now.

1005
00:47:25.818 --> 00:47:28.359
So, to be able to offer a world like that to

1006
00:47:28.359 --> 00:47:30.479
our children is not only my dream,

1007
00:47:30.479 --> 00:47:33.439
I see it manifesting right now.

1008
00:47:33.439 --> 00:47:34.980
<v Regina>Here, here.</v>

1009
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.219
Thank you so much, Foster.

1010
00:47:36.219 --> 00:47:37.920
<v ->And thank you for the great work that you do.</v>

1011
00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:41.980
I have enjoyed your programs ever since the inception,

1012
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:45.839
and to be able to be a part of this community

1013
00:47:45.839 --> 00:47:48.101
that is getting such important work out and to have

1014
00:47:48.101 --> 00:47:49.641
this conversation with you is a real

1015
00:47:49.641 --> 00:47:51.240
delight, thanks for inviting me.

1016
00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:54.481
<v ->Thank you.</v>

1017
00:47:54.481 --> 00:47:56.421
You may want to follow up this interview by going

1018
00:47:56.421 --> 00:48:00.561
to the thrivemovement.com, that's thrivemovement.com,

1019
00:48:00.561 --> 00:48:02.541
a stunning website, to purchase

1020
00:48:02.541 --> 00:48:04.335
a copy of the film, or rent it.

1021
00:48:04.335 --> 00:48:05.754
We bought one so that we could have

1022
00:48:05.754 --> 00:48:07.694
private showings with friends and family.

1023
00:48:07.694 --> 00:48:09.893
If you feel so inspired, you can create your own

1024
00:48:09.893 --> 00:48:12.004
Thrive discussion group and see where your

1025
00:48:12.004 --> 00:48:14.305
group's conversation leads you.
