00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The world is, indeed, in
an important transitional era.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Technological advancement,
globalization in business,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and globalization in the media
and throughout the internet

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.330 align:middle line:84%
are taking us rapidly into
unprecedented opportunities

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.830 align:middle line:90%
and challenges.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.820 align:middle line:84%
We're in a period of
high-speed transformation,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.740 align:middle line:84%
and everything and
everybody is affected by it.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Exciting new research
is showing us

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.680 align:middle line:84%
that we're all connected
through a vast web

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:84%
of energetic connections
that link all living systems.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So our research focuses
on really three spheres--

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.810 align:middle line:84%
personal coherence,
social, and global.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.580 align:middle line:84%
In Global Coherence,
we're really

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.150 align:middle line:84%
looking at the interaction
or the communication,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:84%
really, between humanity,
all of us humans,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.420 align:middle line:90%
and the Earth itself.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:84%
So we've installed these
ultra-sensitive magnetometers

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.940 align:middle line:84%
all around the Earth
that are designed

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.280 align:middle line:84%
to measure what are called
the resonant frequencies,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.410 align:middle line:84%
or the moving fields or
the vibrating fields,

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.980 align:middle line:90%
in the Earth's magnetic fields.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:84%
So what we're seeing here is
that our hearts and brains

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.800 align:middle line:84%
are operating at
the same frequency

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.220 align:middle line:84%
as the magnetic fields, the
resonating frequency, of Earth

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.020 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.350 align:middle line:84%
But we have the
basic understanding

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.980 align:middle line:84%
of how our hearts and brains
can be transferring information

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.320 align:middle line:84%
back and forth between
all of us humans

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.520 align:middle line:90%
and the Earth's field itself.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.080 align:middle line:84%
So what this implies is
that what we think and feel,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.900 align:middle line:84%
but especially what we
feel inside, our emotions,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.550 align:middle line:90%
don't just stay inside of us.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:84%
We know they radiate out
into the field environment

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.787 align:middle line:84%
through our harsh
magnetic fields.

00:01:33.787 --> 00:01:35.870 align:middle line:84%
But what we believe here,
and what I'm suggesting,

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:84%
is that the harsh magnetic
fields connect with

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and couple to the Earth's
vibrating magnetic field.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.003 align:middle line:84%
So it's a globally
distributed energetic effect.

00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's a pretty
cool research.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.060 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing research,
and it opens a door

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.260 align:middle line:84%
for understanding ourselves
in a different new way.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.660 align:middle line:90%
The big deal for me is this.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.380 align:middle line:84%
It begins to show us that,
in fact, we are not alone,

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.600 align:middle line:84%
that we are all in
this together, all

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.520 align:middle line:90%
in this game of life together.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.914 align:middle line:84%
Not as separate as we
perceive sometimes.

00:02:06.914 --> 00:02:09.289 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's the real
beauty of the Global Coherence

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.370 align:middle line:90%
research.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.570 align:middle line:90%
The science is amazing.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.072 align:middle line:84%
It's intriguing,
it's interesting.

00:02:13.072 --> 00:02:15.530 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the day, what
I want people to understand

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.130 align:middle line:90%
from it is we are not alone.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.080 align:middle line:90%


00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>> As a highly connected
global society,

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.690 align:middle line:84%
we are moving rapidly toward
having to make important

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.230 align:middle line:84%
choices that will affect our
present security and the lives

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:90%
of future generations.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.850 align:middle line:84%
But the very challenges
of this time period

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.870 align:middle line:84%
also present opportunities
for a significant shift

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.590 align:middle line:90%
in human consciousness.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Heart-based living is when
one learns to really align with

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.930 align:middle line:84%
the intuitive guidance of
their heart and bring that

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.330 align:middle line:84%
into day-to-day life
and the choices we make.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.220 align:middle line:10%
One of the key aspects
of heart-based living

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.410 align:middle line:10%
is that we become more
inclusive in our thoughts,

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.980 align:middle line:10%
our feelings about
others, and our behaviors.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>> There are so many heart-based
qualities that have been valued

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.630 align:middle line:84%
by countries, nations,
cultures, all over the world.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And there is a good
reason for that.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.910 align:middle line:84%
They really create more
connection with something

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.160 align:middle line:90%
larger with who we really are.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And they allow us to have
more flow, creativity,

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.625 align:middle line:90%
and fulfillment in life.

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, heart-base living
is really just how we walk

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.980 align:middle line:84%
It's just really a way of
being, a way in which we

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.890 align:middle line:84%
carry ourselves, a
way in which we make

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:84%
a contribution to the benefit of
ourselves, to those around us,

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.320 align:middle line:90%
and to the world itself.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:90%


00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>> As our heart, mind, and
emotions come into coherent

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.500 align:middle line:84%
alignment, this strengthens
the heart power that supports

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.010 align:middle line:84%
our individual and
collective intentions.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.280 align:middle line:84%
If we can build the habit of
practicing these techniques,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.730 align:middle line:84%
we will be able to unlock
our higher potentials

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.330 align:middle line:84%
and become more of
who we truly are.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.170 align:middle line:84%
With genuine practice, we
can find within our heart

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:84%
the answers and directions for
the next steps for ourselves

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.210 align:middle line:90%
and our global society.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.850 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.250 align:middle line:84%
With all that's going
on in the world today,

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.920 align:middle line:84%
and in our own lives,
it's important to have

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.310 align:middle line:84%
more compassionate
latitude for ourselves

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.149 align:middle line:84%
and each other, in our
workplaces, with family,

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:22.550 align:middle line:90%
or life's general challenges.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Compassionate latitude
helps us dissolve judgments

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:84%
and separation between
people, allowing us easier

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.580 align:middle line:90%
access to new solutions.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:90%


00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Here's how to get started.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.910 align:middle line:84%
We invite you to try to
apply what you've learned

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:90%
for the next several weeks.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.110 align:middle line:90%
See what changes you experience.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Creating a simple practice
plan that feels right to you

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.750 align:middle line:90%
would be an important next step.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.020 align:middle line:10%
Here are some suggestions.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.910 align:middle line:10%
Use the Quick
Coherence technique

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.790 align:middle line:10%
to prep before a potentially
stressful meeting

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:10%
to maintain your
composure and connect

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.315 align:middle line:10%
with your heart's guidance.

00:05:00.315 --> 00:05:03.750 align:middle line:90%


00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Use it after a stressful
situation to reset

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.960 align:middle line:84%
and reconnect with your
heart to better manage

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.040 align:middle line:84%
the effects of stress
and build resilience.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.350 align:middle line:10%
Use Attitude Breathing
to help shift

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:10%
your inner weather, your
emotional state, at any time.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Practice Attitude
Breathing to shift

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.800 align:middle line:84%
to more positive emotional
states during the day.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.320 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:10%
Use the Freeze-Frame technique
to gain more intuitive clarity

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.380 align:middle line:10%
for making decisions
big and small,

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.380 align:middle line:10%
or to access more creativity
and insight at any time.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Do the technique as
a written exercise,

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:84%
as you did in this
program, when you can.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.140 align:middle line:10%
Finally, and just as important,
practice the Heart Lock-In

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.050 align:middle line:10%
technique for five minutes
or more at a time that's

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.070 align:middle line:10%
convenient to you.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Most people find it
easiest first thing

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.150 align:middle line:84%
in the morning before work
to set the tone for your day

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.060 align:middle line:84%
and create a habit that
fits your lifestyle,

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.400 align:middle line:90%
like brushing your teeth.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.250 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day,
it's actually very simple.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.480 align:middle line:84%
It's about whether you are in
connection with your heart's

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.790 align:middle line:90%
intelligence or not.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you find yourself
out, how do you get back?

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.600 align:middle line:90%
The choice is yours.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And now you have
the tools to help.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I wake up and the very
first thing I do now,

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.940 align:middle line:84%
and this is something
I learned to do,

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
is I just connect to my
heart for even a moment.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:10%
It might be 10 seconds,
it might be 30 seconds,

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.460 align:middle line:10%
not ever over a minute.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.070 align:middle line:84%
I just sit up in
bed and let that be

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.140 align:middle line:90%
the starting point to my day.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And I get up and get the
kids ready for school

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.030 align:middle line:90%
and get them off to school.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I sit down
and I do 10 minutes

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.330 align:middle line:90%
of connecting to my heart.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:90%
I do a Heart Lock-In.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't really
matter what it's called.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I just find that
place in myself that

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.900 align:middle line:84%
is that deeper place
in myself where

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.460 align:middle line:90%
I can feel that sense of love.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of look at
it like I'm filling up

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.380 align:middle line:90%
a gas tank for the day.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And I spend about 10
minutes doing that.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's just filling that
battery or that gas tank.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized is that
when I do that every day,

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:90%
it carries over.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.010 align:middle line:90%
I have better days.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.240 align:middle line:90%
My days just get better.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.700 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like it creates
this reservoir that I

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.610 align:middle line:90%
can tap into through the day.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And it sets the
tone for the day.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The HeartMath techniques
that I use on an everyday basis

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.546 align:middle line:84%
would be, when I'm
talking to you right now,

00:07:46.546 --> 00:07:49.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing my HeartMath.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And just doing it right now,
in this moment, using my skill.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Because by doing that, it allows
me to be present, centered,

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.980 align:middle line:90%
and focused, and focus on you.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the questions
that we get all the time, which

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.240 align:middle line:84%
is the absolute kiss
of death, I want

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.330 align:middle line:84%
to take my game
to the next level.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.750 align:middle line:90%
They'll say, I'm here.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.750 align:middle line:90%
Why are you here?

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.657 align:middle line:84%
I want to take my game
to the next level.

00:08:15.657 --> 00:08:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And so that means
that they're trying.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.907 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to get
to that next step.

00:08:18.907 --> 00:08:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we want to get
players to the next step

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.530 align:middle line:90%
to be able to improve.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.490 align:middle line:84%
But the way you get there is
by standing on the plateau,

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.020 align:middle line:84%
by doing the work, and
continuing to do the work.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And as you continue
to do the work,

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.480 align:middle line:84%
one day you're up
on the next plateau.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.039 align:middle line:90%
It just happens.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:37.429 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the key things
HeartMath is doing to help

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:40.340 align:middle line:10%
usher in heart-based living
and a new era of human

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.039 align:middle line:10%
consciousness is really the
tools and techniques that

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.360 align:middle line:10%
we've developed.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:10%
The knowledge that
the heart is an access

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.590 align:middle line:10%
place to higher wisdom, courage,
and increased intelligence

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:52.850 align:middle line:10%
has been around for millennia.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.350 align:middle line:10%
And it's the central teaching
of every major religion

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle line:10%
on the earth.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.595 align:middle line:84%
But it's come to be
seen as a metaphor.

00:08:58.595 --> 00:09:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And what our research is showing
is it's not just a metaphor.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.380 align:middle line:84%
But the heart really
is an access point

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.200 align:middle line:84%
to our larger self that can
bring in that intelligence

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.970 align:middle line:90%
of another dimension.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And as more people do
that and come together,

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.340 align:middle line:84%
it's going to draw in
a whole new awareness,

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:84%
and what we call heart
intelligence says the next

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:84%
level of human understanding,
of human evolution

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.770 align:middle line:90%
or consciousness.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.010 align:middle line:90%
And I see it happening.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.030 align:middle line:84%
There is more and more
events, global events,

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.100 align:middle line:84%
more people wanting to
connect, more people

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.710 align:middle line:84%
realizing they're lonely and
that something has to change.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:84%
So this extreme pendulum
swing will come back,

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:41.480 align:middle line:84%
and it will help people move
into this new world of heart

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.300 align:middle line:84%
awareness and
heart-based living.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.633 align:middle line:84%
>> In the program, you've been
learning tools and techniques,

00:09:47.633 --> 00:09:50.300 align:middle line:84%
new understandings, new methods,
all underpinned with scientific

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.100 align:middle line:90%
research.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.150 align:middle line:90%
Now what do you do?

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have a framework
you can use to practice.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.010 align:middle line:84%
You can learn to practice tuning
into your heart's intelligence,

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.940 align:middle line:84%
to accessing the wisdom and
the intuition that it provides.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And then using it to sort of
navigate this wild adventure

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.962 align:middle line:90%
that we call life.

00:10:06.962 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:84%
That's what this
system that you've

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:84%
been learning throughout this
course can really offer you.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to
practice, it will get easier.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.340 align:middle line:84%
There'll be more
of a flow to it.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.000 align:middle line:90%
It'll come naturally.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Moment to moment, day to
day will become different.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And over time it creates
a new and very different

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.850 align:middle line:90%
experience of life itself.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.580 align:middle line:84%
So my heart wish to
you is that you'll

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.430 align:middle line:84%
take what you've learned, you'll
put it into your daily life

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.640 align:middle line:84%
in a pragmatic, practical
way that makes sense to you,

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.160 align:middle line:84%
you'll learn to
listen to and follow

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.510 align:middle line:84%
the magnificent intuitive
presence of your heart.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:46.220 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a process of
self-discovery and awakening.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for listening.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.670 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, this
is only the beginning.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:84%
The first step to a
new life as we fade out

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.850 align:middle line:84%
old ways of being and
experience more harmony,

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.700 align:middle line:90%
kindness, compassion.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.020 align:middle line:84%
A new awareness and sense
of fulfillment inside you

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.610 align:middle line:90%
waiting to unfold.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.380 align:middle line:90%
Now it's up to you.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And please, if you ever feel
down, frustrated, or confused,

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.100 align:middle line:84%
don't hesitate to
know, I'll be here.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.000 align:middle line:84%
I have always been here,
and I will always be here.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Please don't forget me.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:42.850 align:middle line:90%
