00:00:16.212 --> 00:00:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd like you to bring
your attention and awareness

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.842 align:middle line:84%
to your heart, to the
center of your chest.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine your breath
is flowing in and out

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.130 align:middle line:84%
through your heart
or chest area,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.280 align:middle line:84%
breathing a little slower
and deeper than usual.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.960 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Just find an easy rhythm
that's comfortable.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.483 align:middle line:84%
Putting your attention
around the heart area

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:50.900 align:middle line:84%
helps you center
and get coherent.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:01:01.610 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.319 align:middle line:84%
As you continue
heart-focused breathing,

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.680 align:middle line:84%
make a sincere
attempt to experience

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.620 align:middle line:84%
a regenerative feeling,
such as appreciation

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.070 align:middle line:84%
or care for someone or
something in your life.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you can
re-experience a time

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.250 align:middle line:84%
when you felt love
or appreciation

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.850 align:middle line:84%
for a person, a pet, a time
in nature, an accomplishment,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.520 align:middle line:84%
or just breathe the attitude
of love or gratitude.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:02:13.990 align:middle line:90%


00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.630 align:middle line:84%
As you're doing this, you're
increasing your coherence

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.980 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Your nervous system
is synchronizing.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Hormones are being released
into your system that

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:90%
regenerate you.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Signals from your
heart to your brain

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.260 align:middle line:84%
are moving through your
emotional and higher brain

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.740 align:middle line:90%
centers.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:84%
This opens the door for you
to experience more uplifting

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.395 align:middle line:84%
emotions and access
to intuitive insight.

00:02:36.395 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>> You've just experienced
the quick coherence technique.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.750 align:middle line:84%
You can shift to your heart
and do it anytime, anywhere,

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.935 align:middle line:90%
eyes open or closed.

00:02:55.935 --> 00:02:59.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:84%
The steps we just did are
heart-focused breathing,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:84%
activate a positive
renewing feeling.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.100 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Quick coherence activates our
heart qualities, such as care,

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.760 align:middle line:90%
compassion, and gratitude.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:84%
If you can't feel one
particular heart quality,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.280 align:middle line:84%
go to another one,
while continuing

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:84%
heart-focused breathing to
energize the heart quality.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:84%
This starts to release
the neurochemicals

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:84%
that lift your system,
clear your mind,

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.880 align:middle line:90%
and increase wholeness health.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.940 align:middle line:84%
We suggest you practice the
quick coherence technique

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.570 align:middle line:84%
several times
during your day, it

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.390 align:middle line:84%
can be especially useful to
restore balance and flow when

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.390 align:middle line:84%
you're feeling
stressed or overloaded.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Another good time to use
it is during transitions

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.440 align:middle line:84%
like before meetings,
before going into work,

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.380 align:middle line:90%
or when coming home.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:84%
An especially useful
application is

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.130 align:middle line:84%
before important communications,
like phone calls, emails,

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.790 align:middle line:84%
or when needing to speak to
somebody about a problem.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:84%
This can prevent a lot of stress
to have to clean up after.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.000 align:middle line:84%
The heart math tools
you are learning

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.029 align:middle line:84%
will help you uncover
your own capacity

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:22.079 align:middle line:84%
to create a new reality
that is best for you.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.120 align:middle line:84%
With the quick
coherence technique,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:84%
you strengthen the
attributes of the heart,

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.680 align:middle line:84%
such as love, appreciation,
care, compassion, breathing

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.860 align:middle line:84%
in these qualities of the
heart and imprinting them

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.150 align:middle line:84%
into your intentions for
health, performance, better

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.010 align:middle line:90%
communication.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Once you get your system
focused in heart coherence,

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.490 align:middle line:84%
this is the optimal time
to envision what you

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.110 align:middle line:90%
want to change for the better.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.240 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.430 align:middle line:10%
>> And honestly, I really just
sort of bask in this amazing

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:04.970 align:middle line:10%
feeling as I'm going along and
linger in this place for a long

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.440 align:middle line:10%
while, because it
really feels great.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And it really sets my tone
and the pace for what I'm

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.782 align:middle line:90%
going to create in this day.

00:05:17.782 --> 00:05:21.487 align:middle line:84%
And this is how I practice
the quick coherence technique.

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:23.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Just throughout my day,
I find myself breathing

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.980 align:middle line:10%
into my heart's area a
lot, and I catch myself.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.190 align:middle line:10%
I'm always amazed at
how often I am tense.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.680 align:middle line:10%
You know, as much as I go
through the world pretty

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.350 align:middle line:10%
happy and joyful
and optimistic, I'm

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.920 align:middle line:10%
just not activating that part
as often as I would like.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.560 align:middle line:84%
So every time I reconnect,
I'm like, oh, OK, right.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.925 align:middle line:90%
This is my home state.

00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I like it, because
I can do it on the fly.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.060 align:middle line:90%
I can do it in the moment.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.780 align:middle line:10%
But I can also do it to prep
for some of those events that

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:10%
might be triggers
for me, and not

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.250 align:middle line:10%
always the dangerous
situations you

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.250 align:middle line:10%
might think of in the field,
but even dealing in my career

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.380 align:middle line:10%
with maybe a boss
that was problematic

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.130 align:middle line:10%
or traffic when I
lived in the DC area.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Quick coherence
was a great go-to

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:84%
for me to just get
into a coherent place,

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.080 align:middle line:84%
feel better, and
once again, thereby

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.780 align:middle line:84%
just giving me clarity
of mind to not let

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.020 align:middle line:90%
the stressors really get to me.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.270 align:middle line:10%
>> The people don't have
to go to meditate or to be

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.910 align:middle line:10%
on their own or to get
away from the situation.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.100 align:middle line:84%
What I love about
HeartMath tools

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.560 align:middle line:90%
is using them with eyes open.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.440 align:middle line:10%
So when people
are in and talking

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.310 align:middle line:10%
about the conflict between
them, using the tools

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.500 align:middle line:10%
while their eyes are
open, still talking,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.700 align:middle line:10%
helps to really heal the
differences or get to a place

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.590 align:middle line:10%
where the differences can be
healed a bit more effectively.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:47.070 align:middle line:10%
>> And for me, that has been
something I've taken seriously

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.640 align:middle line:10%
without the seriousness,
but a commitment.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I've made a commitment and
intention to be aware of that,

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.960 align:middle line:84%
to do the spot checks, to
practice those techniques,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.700 align:middle line:84%
because I want to
contribute love.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.148 align:middle line:84%
>> Signals go up into the
brain that begin to open up

00:07:05.148 --> 00:07:06.940 align:middle line:84%
the higher perceptual
centers of the brain,

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.580 align:middle line:84%
so you begin to
perceive differently.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Things aren't
necessarily as stressful.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.420 align:middle line:90%
Things aren't as confusing.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Things aren't as
frustrating or agitated when

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.300 align:middle line:90%
you're in that state.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're able to see
into how to navigate life.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And actually, as
you practice this,

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.180 align:middle line:84%
the feeling gets easier and
easier to recall and to choose

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.690 align:middle line:84%
on demand, so we can
live a more grateful,

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:34.140 align:middle line:84%
appreciative life without
waiting for something external

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.490 align:middle line:84%
to inspire that appreciation,
but live more in that

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.210 align:middle line:84%
heart-based quality of
gratitude and appreciation more

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.290 align:middle line:84%
of the time, which improves
our health, our relationships,

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:50.130 align:middle line:84%
our communications, our
insight, our intuition.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.210 align:middle line:90%
It has global benefits for us.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And all that happens very
quickly when you use that quick

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.940 align:middle line:84%
coherence technique,
which is simply this--

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.480 align:middle line:84%
heart focus,
heart-focused breathing,

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and the activation of a
regenerative uplifting

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.580 align:middle line:90%
motion of heart feeling.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.450 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Enjoy the process.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.000 align:middle line:90%
