>> Sometimes, we have
an inner knowing,

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.550 align:middle line:84%
a sense of clarity
that just feels right.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.140 align:middle line:84%
It is often just a delicate,
quiet, or easy feeling

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.170 align:middle line:84%
that offers direct
perception, answers

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.320 align:middle line:84%
that seem to come, at
times, out of nowhere,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.790 align:middle line:84%
or a very tangible feeling about
what you should or should not

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.690 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.980 align:middle line:84%
In essence, this is what many
people call their intuition.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.910 align:middle line:84%
These intuitive feelings show
up in most people's lives

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.140 align:middle line:84%
from time to time, random
events that we remember

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.085 align:middle line:90%

What if intuition need not
be so random and fleeting?

What if we could make
practical intuition

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.580 align:middle line:84%
a normal part of our lives,
something that we can access

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.370 align:middle line:90%
more often and more easily?

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.740 align:middle line:90%

where accessing heart

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.560 align:middle line:84%
when you have a big
decision to make,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle line:84%
or you are having a
hard time figuring out

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%

your capacity

for discerning direction
in sensitive situations,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:84%
deciding when it is
time to speak up,

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.830 align:middle line:84%
or when it is time to hold back,
determining what attitude you

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.830 align:middle line:84%
should bring to a
particular situation,

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.950 align:middle line:84%
detecting when life
is feeding back to us

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.470 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
change an attitude

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.995 align:middle line:84%
or disposition, to help guide

out in business that people

But I have noticed, over the
last 10 years, intuition,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.035 align:middle line:84%
which was nowhere in leadership
competence in any situation,

00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:25.410 align:middle line:84%
now, in organizations,
where they

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84%
have a set of
leadership competencies,

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:90%
intuition is there.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think, we're in a
time in the business world,

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.500 align:middle line:84%

more comfortable to talk

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a multi-purpose technique
for stopping energy drains

from mentally and emotionally
processing a problem,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and then gaining clarity

intuitive guidance as a
more effective approach.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:84%
It works by shifting

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.430 align:middle line:84%
into a coherent state to
synchronize heart and brain,

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.150 align:middle line:84%
then asking yourself questions

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Pick something where
you'd like to know

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.040 align:middle line:84%

heart's intuitive guidance.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.420 align:middle line:84%

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:84%

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.190 align:middle line:90%

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.640 align:middle line:84%
Keep your attention
there as you breathe

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.100 align:middle line:90%
in a comfortable rhythm.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Imagine your breath is flowing

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Make a sincere

a regenerative feeling,
such as appreciation

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.120 align:middle line:84%
or care for someone or
something in your life.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Remember, don't try to
simply visualize it,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.120 align:middle line:84%
but rather to feel it
fully, reexperience it.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:42.780 align:middle line:90%


00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, ask a question
from the heart.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.230 align:middle line:84%
From this more
objective place, ask

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.490 align:middle line:84%
yourself, what would be a
more efficient or effective

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.335 align:middle line:90%
attitude, action, or solution?

00:05:55.335 --> 00:06:25.470 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the response
of your heart.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Quietly observe any subtle
changes in perceptions,

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.285 align:middle line:90%
attitudes, or feelings.

00:06:33.285 --> 00:06:45.110 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Write down what your
heart's intuitive guidance

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.750 align:middle line:84%
offered you, even if
it's just one or two

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:84%
words or a simple attitude shift
that your heart is suggesting,

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:84%
as this can lead
to new solutions.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:05.150 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Commit to sustaining
beneficial attitude shifts

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.170 align:middle line:90%
and acting on new insights.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:16.980 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, read what you first
wrote down, and then read

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:26.850 align:middle line:84%
your heart's response,
which is more intelligent.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.730 align:middle line:84%
We suggest you do the
freeze-frame technique

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.280 align:middle line:84%
in writing until you
get comfortable with it.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you can use it
more casually to help

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.940 align:middle line:84%
you gain the intuitive
discrimination you

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.190 align:middle line:84%
need for making
choices and decisions.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.060 align:middle line:84%
It will work for you
if you work with it.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Here are the quick steps
of this technique--

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.950 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge,
heart-focused breathing,

00:07:52.950 --> 00:08:00.560 align:middle line:84%
activate a positive or renewing
feeling, ask, observe and act.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The major benefit that
freeze-frame gives me is when

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.450 align:middle line:84%
things are going
all over the place,

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and things are going wrong,
we're in this emotional

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.718 align:middle line:90%
turmoil.

00:08:13.718 --> 00:08:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest component
around the freeze-frame

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.600 align:middle line:84%
is to shift to that
coherent state.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in that
position, that allows you

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:29.320 align:middle line:84%
this deeper wisdom, this
perspective, which, at the very

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.549 align:middle line:84%
least, just calms your nerves,
though, at a lot of the times,

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:36.880 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to really access
some deep, profound insights

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.035 align:middle line:90%
on what to do next.

00:08:38.035 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>> It's my favorite because
it really embraces, I think,

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.850 align:middle line:84%
the essence of what
HeartMath is about.

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.910 align:middle line:84%
So it allows us to get
into a more coherent state,

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.440 align:middle line:90%
physiologically speaking.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.740 align:middle line:84%
So we're sending a different
coherent signal to the brain.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.020 align:middle line:84%
But it also has, then, a
step where we ask our heart

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.790 align:middle line:90%
for its intuitive guidance.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.700 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're accessing
that larger part of ourself

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.040 align:middle line:84%
to get that flow of
intuitive information

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.200 align:middle line:84%
from that larger
part of ourself.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.590 align:middle line:84%
That often brings in solutions
for out-of-the-box thinking.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:84%
So I use this all the
time, scientifically,

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.990 align:middle line:84%
when I'm writing a paper or
having to design a new study.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.758 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful
technique for really

00:09:13.758 --> 00:09:16.300 align:middle line:84%
being able to access that deeper
part of ourself, that deeper

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.500 align:middle line:90%
wisdom that we have.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So I love this technique
because of how useful it is

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.020 align:middle line:90%
and what it gives you.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a combination
of the physiology,

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.580 align:middle line:84%
the emotional
qualities of the heart,

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and then the intuitive
access that that gives you.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.750 align:middle line:84%
So if I have to
make a big decision,

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.860 align:middle line:84%
sure, I'm going to use the
logic, linear intelligence.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use what I know
from the past, what my life

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:39.340 align:middle line:90%
experience has shown me.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.770 align:middle line:84%
All those things
are important too.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.640 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also going to
get a second opinion.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.448 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to consult
with my heart.

00:09:47.448 --> 00:09:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to take
