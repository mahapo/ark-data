00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The best news of all is
that feeling more regenerative

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.240 align:middle line:84%
emotions is attainable for
each and every one of us.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.680 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's shift from left to
right on your inner weather

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.290 align:middle line:84%
report now, using the
Attitude Breathing technique.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Attitudes can create
bundles of emotions.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.510 align:middle line:84%
They can generate emotional
undercurrents or background

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.390 align:middle line:84%
noise that affect
our mood swings,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.080 align:middle line:84%
the way we feel overall
in our relationships.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.600 align:middle line:84%
The attitude breathing
technique helps

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.315 align:middle line:84%
us instate replacement attitudes
that are more effective

00:00:41.315 --> 00:00:42.115 align:middle line:90%
and save energy.

00:00:42.115 --> 00:00:44.680 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.830 align:middle line:84%
The first step is to observe
what you are feeling.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:84%
What emotional
patterns and attitudes

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.270 align:middle line:84%
have you been
experiencing today?

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you've been feeling a
little frustrated, or perhaps

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.590 align:middle line:84%
anxious or maybe a little
down on yourself or on life.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you've been
feeling, it's OK.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.715 align:middle line:84%
It's just time now
to make a shift.

00:01:03.715 --> 00:01:06.270 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, I'm Deborah Rozman,
and I'll lead you through

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.870 align:middle line:84%
the Attitude Breathing
technique now.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.720 align:middle line:84%
First, just recognize
the feeling or attitude

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.520 align:middle line:90%
you want to change.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.350 align:middle line:90%


00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.570 align:middle line:90%
What would you rather feel?

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.000 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Then choose an
attitude or feeling

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.705 align:middle line:90%
you'd like to replace it with.

00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:33.600 align:middle line:90%


00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.210 align:middle line:90%
Here are some examples.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if you've been feeling
stress, you'd rather feel calm.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.130 align:middle line:84%
If you've been
feeling overloaded,

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.030 align:middle line:84%
you want to replace it
with a feeling of ease.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Or if you've been
feeling judgmental, how

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.030 align:middle line:84%
about replacing it with
kindness or compassion?

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.660 align:middle line:84%
You can now choose an
attitude to replace

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.010 align:middle line:84%
the one you identified, or
be open to a new replacement

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:90%
attitude from your intuition.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.630 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.426 align:middle line:84%
Next, focus your attention
in the area of the heart.

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And imagine your breath
is flying in and out

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.380 align:middle line:84%
of your heart or chest area,
breathing a little slower

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.586 align:middle line:90%
and deeper than usual.

00:02:25.586 --> 00:02:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's find an easy rhythm
that's comfortable.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.750 align:middle line:84%
As you continue
heart-focused breathing,

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:84%
practice breathing
in and increasing

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.320 align:middle line:84%
the feeling of your new
replacement attitude.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Just stay with it until you
start to feel the shift.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:17.130 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Now practice maintaining your
new attitude and perceptions

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.500 align:middle line:84%
as you move through your
day-to-day interactions.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Use Attitude Breathing on the
go and to reset your replacement

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.250 align:middle line:90%
attitude if it starts to fade.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.675 align:middle line:84%
Here are the Attitude
Breathing quick steps.

00:03:35.675 --> 00:03:38.690 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Recognize the
feeling or attitude

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.720 align:middle line:84%
you want to change,
breathe in a replacement

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:84%
attitude or feeling, practice
maintaining your new attitude

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.710 align:middle line:90%
and composure.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Attitude Breathing helps open
the heart so that our intuitive

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.270 align:middle line:84%
heart intelligence can provide
insight that allows a bigger

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.630 align:middle line:84%
picture to emerge
in our perceptions,

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:84%
and facilitates mental
and emotional healing.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.250 align:middle line:10%
As you practice maintaining your
new attitudes and perceptions,

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.550 align:middle line:10%
as you move through your
day-to-day interactions,

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.970 align:middle line:10%
eventually your heart-brain
communication pathway

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.450 align:middle line:10%
will help you release negative
emotional patterns stored

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.080 align:middle line:10%
in your amygdala, and new
perceptions that help free you

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.210 align:middle line:10%
from draining
emotional memories,

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.560 align:middle line:10%
you begin to uncover a new you.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's pretty simple, but
I think the trickiest part

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.880 align:middle line:84%
of this whole technique is
slowing down and acknowledging

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:90%
what you're feeling.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Most of us don't do that enough.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.070 align:middle line:84%
But when we do,
there's great benefit

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:84%
in seeing how we are
functioning within the context

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.470 align:middle line:84%
of our day, and our week,
or month, or whatever.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.970 align:middle line:10%
>> When I had
post-traumatic stress,

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.678 align:middle line:10%
and when I first
started using HeartMath,

00:04:48.678 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle line:10%
there were times I had to do
the tools every two minutes

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.140 align:middle line:10%
because my nervous system
was had a baseline of trauma

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.480 align:middle line:10%
and hypervigilance.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.590 align:middle line:84%
But once I learned
Attitude Breathing--

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.560 align:middle line:84%
If you think about attitudes, if
emotions are a flow of energy,

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:84%
like a river, each time
I use a HeartMath tool,

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.910 align:middle line:84%
I might be taking one
bucket to the river

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.830 align:middle line:84%
and putting it in
another direction.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.030 align:middle line:84%
But when I change
an attitude, that's

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.900 align:middle line:90%
like rerouting the river banks.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:84%
It changes the entire
emotional flow.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.120 align:middle line:84%
So this morning,
for example, I was

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.900 align:middle line:84%
working with just an attitude
that life itself is a gift.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And breathing that attitude,
as I'm preparing right now

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:84%
for a major surgery,
it changed my attitude

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.030 align:middle line:84%
of fear and apprehension
moving into this big life event

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.880 align:middle line:84%
into what a gift the
surgery itself is

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.310 align:middle line:84%
and how that's going to
improve my quality of life.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to micromanage
every little emotion in talking

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle line:90%
to all the surgeons today.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.640 align:middle line:84%
I could instead just change
an attitude, and the emotions

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.440 align:middle line:90%
that automatically followed it.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very efficient
move to change an attitude.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>> HeartMath allows
kids a choice point.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.120 align:middle line:84%
It gives them an opportunity,
once they are aware,

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.760 align:middle line:84%
that they don't have to run
the mill through anxiety

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and through fear and
through always needing

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.210 align:middle line:84%
to worry about
what's coming next

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.800 align:middle line:84%
in their next activity or
their next homework assignment.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.750 align:middle line:84%
That it gives them
an opportunity

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.470 align:middle line:90%
to stop and make a choice.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And coming to their
heart gives them a focus.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Rather than focusing on whatever
else they need to worry about,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.960 align:middle line:90%
they can come to their heart.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's a safe place.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's a place
where they can connect

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.340 align:middle line:84%
with more positive
emotions that they

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:84%
can use to break the cycle
of the anxiety and the stress

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.190 align:middle line:84%
from their environments, and
gives them an opportunity

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.450 align:middle line:84%
to input a different
emotion that

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.360 align:middle line:84%
then sets their physiology into
a totally different trajectory.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.800 align:middle line:10%
>> I think that the
HeartMath tools really help

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.660 align:middle line:10%
the individual to use
these things in the moments

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.940 align:middle line:10%
of duress, which is
when we want those.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And so much of life,
what I see is that we

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle line:90%
lose our power all the time.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
tools like HeartMath

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.630 align:middle line:84%
help to re-establish that
connection with what you know

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:47.530 align:middle line:90%
is true.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.570 align:middle line:84%
It creates the
opportunity for you

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.160 align:middle line:84%
to create a new
awareness of what

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.755 align:middle line:90%
you're doing in the moment.

00:07:52.755 --> 00:07:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And are you really
in the moment?

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And recognizing that
you're in the moment also

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.090 align:middle line:84%
helps you recognize
that you're out of it.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So can you come back
to the conversation?

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Can you come back to the
internal conversation?

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.740 align:middle line:10%
>> The huge difference that
HeartMath has brought to me

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.430 align:middle line:10%
in my profession is that I'm
able to use these tools in real

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.840 align:middle line:10%
time.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.280 align:middle line:10%
That is the magic
of these tools.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So eyes open, I can really
be in a beautiful heart

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.460 align:middle line:90%
space with my patient.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm being
challenged, if I'm

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.400 align:middle line:84%
starting to go into
the effects of stress,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I can actually bring myself
back by focusing my attention

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:28.990 align:middle line:90%
on my heart.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.282 align:middle line:84%
And I think much more clearly
and communicate much more

00:08:31.282 --> 00:08:32.840 align:middle line:90%
effectively with them.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's really shifted how I
practice and how I communicate.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.390 align:middle line:84%
So with these tools,
you can elegantly

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.960 align:middle line:84%
navigate away from states
that are less favorable,

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.400 align:middle line:84%
like depleting emotions, to
more rejuvenating and renewing

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.120 align:middle line:84%
emotions, and to think more
clearly and just be a better

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.530 align:middle line:90%
person that we all want to be.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>> We actually clear the slate
and we come back to a neutral

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:58.610 align:middle line:90%
balance.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.443 align:middle line:84%
And that gives us more
choice in the moment.

00:09:00.443 --> 00:09:04.640 align:middle line:84%
It gives us a pause
to be able to say, OK,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.310 align:middle line:90%
what do I want to do now?

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:11.500 align:middle line:84%
What is the best action or
perception for this situation?

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And having that ability to take
charge and pause in the moment,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and pause our physiological
reaction, really

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.630 align:middle line:84%
saves a tremendous
amount of energy.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>> At the beginning, it may
seem hard or discouraging.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Yet with practice, you
can learn to recognize

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.240 align:middle line:90%
your heart's intuition.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Our heart is wise, and it
speaks to us in numerous ways.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.860 align:middle line:84%
If you can build the habit
of practicing techniques,

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.370 align:middle line:84%
like attitude breathing or
quick coherence whenever

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.930 align:middle line:84%
you start to feel stress, you
will gain immediate benefits.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.870 align:middle line:84%
If you commit to practicing
these techniques at least

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.450 align:middle line:84%
once a day for the
next six weeks,

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.930 align:middle line:84%
you will build resilience
and have more resources

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:59.350 align:middle line:84%
to face the challenges
of our everyday life,

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:04.240 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy a richer and
more nurturing experience.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.210 align:middle line:10%
Six weeks is the time
that it often takes

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.880 align:middle line:10%
to anchor in a new
habit, to create

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.940 align:middle line:10%
a baseline shift in
your emotional responses

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.580 align:middle line:10%
to life, a new neural pattern.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's worth committing
to a simple practice that

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.720 align:middle line:84%
doesn't take much time
but is very effective.
