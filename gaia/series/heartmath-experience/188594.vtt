00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260 align:middle line:90%


00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, this is your heart.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Can you hear me?

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.080 align:middle line:90%
Can you feel me?

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.900 align:middle line:84%
I know we haven't
talked in a long time,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.140 align:middle line:84%
but I was thinking maybe
you could use a little break

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.000 align:middle line:90%
to reconnect.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Take this time to
re-evaluate what

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.060 align:middle line:84%
you've come to know about
yourself and the world.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.990 align:middle line:84%
After all, this is a
story about your life.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a story about you and me,
about all of us as individuals

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.120 align:middle line:84%
and as a whole,
and about new ways

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.820 align:middle line:84%
to see that we
are all connected.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So come along with me
on an uplifting journey

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.310 align:middle line:90%
of heart, mind, and spirit.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's discover how
to reconnect and move

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.480 align:middle line:84%
from your old life to a new one,
starting right here, right now.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever noticed how
sometimes life just seems

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.700 align:middle line:84%
to fly past us, as if everything
moved a million miles per hour?

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.520 align:middle line:84%
More to do and
less time, as if we

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.840 align:middle line:84%
had a list of never-ending
errands on us at all times.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.500 align:middle line:84%
It's often hard to keep up,
and easy to feel exhausted,

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:90%
overwhelmed.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.570 align:middle line:84%
More and more people are
feeling lonely, separated

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:90%
from themselves and others.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.850 align:middle line:84%
If you're feeling some of this,
know that you're not alone.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.670 align:middle line:84%
This is the state of
the world we live in.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.610 align:middle line:84%
This increasing
complexity we experience

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:84%
in our over-competitive
modern life

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.180 align:middle line:84%
is an outward reflection
of the speed of change.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Life, including each of
us, is always evolving.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just happening
at a very fast pace

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.370 align:middle line:84%
now, during an important
and unique time in history.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Old systems are failing and
new ones are trying to emerge.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.729 align:middle line:84%
Numerous societies
and governments

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.870 align:middle line:84%
are in a state of chaos
or transformation.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:84%
These are the evolutionary
conditions of our time.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:90%


00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:84%
However, another momentum
is also taking place.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Many people from different
backgrounds, cultures,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.980 align:middle line:84%
and professions are sensing
an impetus for positive change

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.920 align:middle line:84%
within themselves
and in the world.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.910 align:middle line:10%
There is an inner stirring, a
prompting from our intuition,

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.230 align:middle line:10%
to awaken to new possibilities
and a desire to grow.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.010 align:middle line:84%
That we can create, not wait,
for more balance and flow

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.640 align:middle line:84%
through these times of change
and empowerment opportunity.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.100 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important
aspects of the changes taking

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:84%
place is a rediscovery
of what's been hidden

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:90%
in plain sight all along.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.780 align:middle line:90%
It's the heart.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Along with the chaos,
there is a new emergence

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.590 align:middle line:84%
of heart-based awareness
and heart intelligence.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Researchers are
finding that learning

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.060 align:middle line:84%
how to access the
heart's intelligence

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.410 align:middle line:84%
is a key to managing the speed
of personal and planetary

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.650 align:middle line:84%
change, and creating
a new life experience.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.760 align:middle line:90%


00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.410 align:middle line:10%
>> So I think that the most
important discovery in the last

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.140 align:middle line:10%
thousands of years or more
is actually the discovery

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.405 align:middle line:10%
of electricity.

00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:38.115 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, people knew
about electricity.

00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:40.490 align:middle line:10%
They knew it was there, but
they didn't know what it was.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.090 align:middle line:10%
And they didn't know what
you could do with it.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Once they figured out how
to harness electricity,

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.050 align:middle line:90%
everything changed.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.690 align:middle line:84%
The way we live
changed completely.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.125 align:middle line:84%
And it happened really,
really fast, too.

00:03:52.125 --> 00:03:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And so the world
we live in today

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.380 align:middle line:84%
is a different world
because of electricity.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.900 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, I think the
same is true about heart.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.810 align:middle line:90%
We know about heart.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.810 align:middle line:84%
It's been talked about,
it's been written about,

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:90%
it's been sung about.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.228 align:middle line:84%
People refer to it when
they point to themselves.

00:04:05.228 --> 00:04:06.770 align:middle line:84%
They point right
here to their heart.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.063 align:middle line:90%
So we know about heart.

00:04:09.063 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:84%
But the true potential of
heart and the intelligence

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:84%
that it has is yet
to be unfolded.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:90%
That's changing now.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And when we begin to harness
the true power and intelligence

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.250 align:middle line:84%
of heart, everything is going
to change for us about how

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.980 align:middle line:84%
we think, how we feel,
how the world functions,

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.760 align:middle line:90%
how we relate to one another.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.310 align:middle line:84%
All of that will
change dramatically,

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.510 align:middle line:90%
and it will change quickly.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.833 align:middle line:84%
Just like electricity
changed the outer world,

00:04:30.833 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:84%
heart's going to
change the inner world.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.290 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.160 align:middle line:10%
>> In this experience through
learning simple techniques,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.640 align:middle line:10%
seeing real life examples,
and hearing from experts

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.240 align:middle line:10%
and others, you will have
the opportunity to experience

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.210 align:middle line:10%
your heart's intelligence and
how it can help you physically,

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.450 align:middle line:10%
emotionally, and spiritually.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:84%
You'll see how you can
connect with your heart

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.450 align:middle line:84%
in practical ways to reduce
the stress of daily life,

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.180 align:middle line:84%
meet challenges with
more ease, and become

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.920 align:middle line:90%
more of who you truly are.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Join me on a journey
that will help you

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.590 align:middle line:84%
move from depletion to renewal,
from separation to connection.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:20.100 align:middle line:84%
From mind to heart to spirit,
rediscover your best self.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.230 align:middle line:90%
It's time to get reacquainted.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.480 align:middle line:84%
It's time to get
along with each other.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.290 align:middle line:90%
It's heart time on the planet.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:38.000 align:middle line:90%
