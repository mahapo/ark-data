with us from the beginning

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.900 align:middle line:90%
to the end of our life cycle.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And yet most of us have been
introduced to their heart

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.750 align:middle line:84%
as just a 10-ounce muscle
that pumps our blood

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.290 align:middle line:84%
and maintains its
circulation until we die.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.270 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Looked at biologically, the
heart's efficiency is amazing.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.780 align:middle line:84%
If we take care of
our health, the heart

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.900 align:middle line:84%
can work without
interruption for 100 years,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.850 align:middle line:84%
without care or cleaning,
without repair or replacement.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.110 align:middle line:84%
But for everyone too, the
heart has another dimension,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.640 align:middle line:90%
much more profound.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:84%
We find this in
popular expressions,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.450 align:middle line:84%
such as "listen to your
heart," "follow your heart,"

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.080 align:middle line:84%
"put your heart into
it," amongst many more.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.450 align:middle line:84%
These expressions
of heart resonate

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.800 align:middle line:84%
within all of us, whatever
your age, religion, ethnicity,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:90%
or education.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Actually, those expressions
can be found in most languages

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.170 align:middle line:84%

ancient cultures.

as a source of intelligence
and inner guidance.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.548 align:middle line:90%

thousands of years is true.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.870 align:middle line:84%
We now know the physical heart
is an information processing

important signals to the brain

Yes, your heart, at a

is not just physical.

some of the highest

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Many of the highest quality
feelings we experience

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.370 align:middle line:90%
are associated with the heart.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.830 align:middle line:84%
They would include emotions
like appreciation, care, love,

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.880 align:middle line:84%
kindness, patience,
and compassion.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Their transformational
value is born

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.130 align:middle line:84%
from our energetic
or spiritual heart,

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.430 align:middle line:84%
which affects the physical
heart's information.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.460 align:middle line:84%
The heart is also associated
with a deeper source of wisdom,

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:84%
an intuitive knowingness
that bypasses

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.230 align:middle line:84%
normal, logical, linear
thought patterns.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.010 align:middle line:84%
This is often called the
"voice in the heart,"

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and known to support us
with much better choices

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.410 align:middle line:84%
and direction throughout
life's interactions.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Our heart's intuition
is the voice

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.920 align:middle line:90%
of our true, authentic self.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.650 align:middle line:84%
When we're in connection
with that part of ourselves,

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:84%
that's when we're able to
move beyond our limitations

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.650 align:middle line:84%
and accomplish things
that can surprise us.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.726 align:middle line:90%

>> The qualities of the heart
are usually talked about

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.090 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the emotions that
we feel-- love, and care,

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:90%
and compassion, appreciation.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:10%
Those type of
emotional qualities

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.510 align:middle line:10%
are often associated with heart.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.740 align:middle line:84%
But also, there are others, like
our nobility, dignity, honor,

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.130 align:middle line:90%
courage, kindness, patience.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.130 align:middle line:84%
All those are what I call
the qualities of the heart.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And when we manifest those
qualities in daily life,

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.420 align:middle line:90%
life treats us differently.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.035 align:middle line:90%
It feeds back to us differently.

00:04:00.035 --> 00:04:01.660 align:middle line:84%
When we put out those
kind of qualities

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.330 align:middle line:84%
in our daily interactions,
life is generally

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.240 align:middle line:84%
going to reward us in a
completely different way.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, the most powerful
quality of the heart is love

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.870 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.200 align:middle line:10%
So if you could see
an entire rainbow,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.110 align:middle line:10%
and love was all the
colors of that rainbow,

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.110 align:middle line:10%
you could break down
every quality of the heart

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.210 align:middle line:10%
inside the color
spectrum of that,

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.790 align:middle line:10%
whether it's care, compassion.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Really powerful one
because that helps not only

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.930 align:middle line:84%
you liberate yourself from the
stress, and it helps healing,

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.730 align:middle line:84%
but it helps others
and lifts them.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:84%

we feel more than we may think.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:10%
And so learning to connect
with these heart qualities,

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.010 align:middle line:10%
activate them, nurture them,
actually send different signals

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.030 align:middle line:10%
from the heart to the brain
that change how we perceive,

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.830 align:middle line:10%

ability to choose

how we respond to
situations that are

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.230 align:middle line:10%
best for ourselves and others.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.870 align:middle line:10%

emotions we experience,

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.160 align:middle line:10%
things like compassion,
appreciation, or gratitude,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.650 align:middle line:10%
just feeling good, that the
heart sends a very different

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.010 align:middle line:10%
type of signal to the brain than
when we're feeling stressed,

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.400 align:middle line:10%
or things like impatient
or frustrated, anxious,

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:10%
these types of things.

with the military,

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.570 align:middle line:84%
and things like
courage, dignity, honor,

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.330 align:middle line:84%
those are core heart
qualities that help lift them.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.630 align:middle line:84%
When I'm working
with health care--

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.720 align:middle line:84%
compassion, care,
kindness, those

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:84%
are heart qualities that
equally lift one's nature.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.270 align:middle line:84%
We just have to be honest
with what's meaningful to you.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So now, we're starting to
have a scientific understanding

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.530 align:middle line:84%
that these higher quality
emotions that people always

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.030 align:middle line:84%
associated with the heart,
really do affect the way

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.530 align:middle line:84%
the heart beats, and the quality
of the neural signals being

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.430 align:middle line:84%
sent to the brain, which
it then interprets.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.260 align:middle line:84%

to understand that the heart is

about a lot of things.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.930 align:middle line:90%
Certainly, it's about intuition.
