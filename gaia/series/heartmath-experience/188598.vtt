00:00:01.704 --> 00:00:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Our everyday life is
dictated by emotions,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.460 align:middle line:84%
much more than we
can see or perceive.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.370 align:middle line:84%
For example, can
you imagine what

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.890 align:middle line:84%
it would be like if you
took an exciting trip

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.590 align:middle line:84%
into an unknown
and exotic country,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.810 align:middle line:84%
but couldn't feel
the exhilarating

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.740 align:middle line:90%
rush of excitement?

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.760 align:middle line:84%
What if you spent time with
family or close friends,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.700 align:middle line:84%
but couldn't feel
the love between you?

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.770 align:middle line:84%
The ability to laugh or cry,
to feel blissful or scared

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.300 align:middle line:84%
is a source of beauty
and adventure in life.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.930 align:middle line:84%
We crave feeling because
the experience of emotion

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.736 align:middle line:90%
makes life matter.

00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:84%
It transforms our world from
an objective, conceptual fact

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.050 align:middle line:84%
into a living,
breathing experience.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.405 align:middle line:84%
Emotions add texture
to our lives.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:01:00.380 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:10%
However, emotions can
sometimes be very painful.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Emotional problems are among
the most difficult to deal with,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.260 align:middle line:84%
especially if they are
long standing or traumatic.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.870 align:middle line:84%
While the enigmatic
power of emotions

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.730 align:middle line:84%
can enrich our lives
beyond measure,

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.990 align:middle line:84%
it can create challenges
just as easily.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:84%
The intelligence needed to
manage this potent inner force,

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.800 align:middle line:84%
using it for our highest
good, has largely

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.840 align:middle line:90%
eluded mankind for centuries.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.370 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.770 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy being human.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.440 align:middle line:84%
We go through a lot of
stressful situations

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.850 align:middle line:84%
in our everyday life, whether
it's our work, our family,

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.100 align:middle line:90%
our love life, or our health.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:84%
These scenarios that
often enrich our life

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.290 align:middle line:84%
can also take a
heavy toll on us.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.370 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.770 align:middle line:90%
This may seem familiar to you.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Take any one of
these situations.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, think about the
negative emotions

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.020 align:middle line:84%
you usually feel when things
get a little bit rough.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.919 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:16.060 align:middle line:84%
You're most likely to feel
stressed, pressured, angered,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:84%
depressed, sad, afraid,
or disappointed.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.140 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.180 align:middle line:84%
These emotions are
a part of life.

[UPBEAT MUSIC]

You might try to have some fun.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.380 align:middle line:10%
So you go out to socialize.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.750 align:middle line:90%
You watch sports.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.180 align:middle line:90%
You get a drink.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, you want to
connect with nature

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.020 align:middle line:90%
or listen to some music.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.100 align:middle line:84%

can provide enjoyment.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.130 align:middle line:84%
But they are merely temporary
releases from the debilitating

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:90%
emotions we can often feel.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Do you see a pattern?

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Many of us go through life
stuck on an emotional loop,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.920 align:middle line:84%
relying on external
resources, which

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.540 align:middle line:84%
address the effects, but not the
actual cause of our problems.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.950 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps, there is a better way.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Through the eyes
of the heart, we

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.290 align:middle line:84%
can begin to understand
that emotions are not just

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.020 align:middle line:84%
reactions, and,
most importantly,

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.920 align:middle line:84%
that you do have the ability
to choose your emotional state

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:90%
and not be a victim of life.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.270 align:middle line:84%
No emotions we experience
are wrong or bad.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.965 align:middle line:90%
They are a part of life.

00:03:43.965 --> 00:03:46.630 align:middle line:84%
However, it becomes
obvious that some

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.200 align:middle line:84%
of the emotions we experience
renew us and add quality

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.280 align:middle line:84%
to our lives, and others
deplete us and rob us

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.800 align:middle line:90%
of vitality and enjoyment.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.890 align:middle line:90%
Your body knows the difference.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Every time you make
an emotional shift,

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:09.310 align:middle line:84%
like from joy to sadness,
anger to calm, love to anxiety,

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and so on, at least
1,400 biochemical changes

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.910 align:middle line:84%
take place inside
you immediately.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.910 align:middle line:84%
These hormonal changes
are not fleeting.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:90%
They affect your body for hours.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Depleting emotions
release excessive amounts

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.260 align:middle line:84%
of stress hormones into your
system, like too much cortisol

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and adrenaline
affecting your health.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, when we experience
heart-related renewing

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.950 align:middle line:84%
emotions, your body produces
regenerative hormones,

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.210 align:middle line:84%
like the anti-aging hormone
DHEA and the "love hormone"

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:90%
oxytocin.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Renewing emotions
increase our resilience.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Stress accumulates, creating
nervous system chaos,

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.380 align:middle line:84%
and drains our energy, while
renewing emotions and attitudes

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.450 align:middle line:90%
recharge our inner battery.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.660 align:middle line:84%
We can learn to move
from depletion to renewal

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.850 align:middle line:84%
by activating the
power of the heart.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, emotions
play an important role

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.310 align:middle line:84%
in how you think and behave, and
in your health and longevity.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:84%
They are like our
internal weather.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.860 align:middle line:84%
They shape our
perception of reality

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and influence the
decisions we make,

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.990 align:middle line:84%
both in the short and
long term, from what

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.170 align:middle line:84%
we decide to have for
breakfast to which candidates

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.530 align:middle line:84%
we choose to vote for
in political elections.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.440 align:middle line:84%
By being more aware of
the power that emotions

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.190 align:middle line:84%
have in our everyday life,
we can gain better control

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.080 align:middle line:90%
and take charge of them.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Emotions teach us a
lot about ourselves.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.820 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, they help us.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.220 align:middle line:84%
At other times,
they get in the way.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.940 align:middle line:84%
It can seem like we don't
have a choice, but we do.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not always easy.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:84%
But with practice, it becomes
easier than you may think.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's do an exercise
now to get a better

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:84%
sense of how you're experiencing
emotions that renew or drain

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.870 align:middle line:10%
By using the inner
weather report,

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.830 align:middle line:10%
you can begin to see emotional
patterns that deplete you

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.690 align:middle line:10%
and those that regenerate you.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.610 align:middle line:84%
By doing so, you'll get a better
view of what needs to change.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Emotions on the
upper left are those

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.490 align:middle line:84%
that have a lot of energy
associated with them.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Are they draining or renewing?

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself, what
emotions do you

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.810 align:middle line:84%
experience that
would be represented

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.880 align:middle line:90%
in the upper left quadrant?

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.130 align:middle line:10%
And how do they affect you?

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.510 align:middle line:90%


00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.515 align:middle line:90%
Here are some examples.

00:06:41.515 --> 00:06:54.260 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.740 align:middle line:10%
The lower left
quadrant represents

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.160 align:middle line:10%
emotions that are less
energized, but often very

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.070 align:middle line:10%
depleting.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.070 align:middle line:10%

in the lower left quadrant?

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.160 align:middle line:10%
And how do they affect you?

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.127 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.127 --> 00:07:16.085 align:middle line:90%
Here are some examples.

00:07:16.085 --> 00:07:24.124 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.124 --> 00:07:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's look at the
other side of this grid.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:10%
In the lower right, we have
emotions that don't necessarily

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.010 align:middle line:10%
have a lot of energy in them,
but they are very renewing.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.310 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.580 align:middle line:10%
What emotions do you experience
that would be represented

in the lower right quadrant?

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.970 align:middle line:10%

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.660 align:middle line:84%
The last quadrant
is the upper right.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Here is where you
experience emotions that

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.970 align:middle line:90%
are regenerative and energized.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.420 align:middle line:84%
What emotions do you experience
that would be represented

in the upper right quadrant?

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.730 align:middle line:90%
And how do they affect you?

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:21.470 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:22.600 align:middle line:90%

see, experiencing life

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.090 align:middle line:84%
on the right side is a lot
more enjoyable, healthy,

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.309 align:middle line:90%
and productive than on the left.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself, how often
am I living emotionally

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.490 align:middle line:90%
on the left versus the right?

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:54.470 align:middle line:84%
What patterns do you see in how
you experience your emotions?

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Think about how
life would be if you

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.810 align:middle line:84%
were experiencing more
regenerative emotions more

thousands of moments.

moments on the right side of
your inner weather report?

can help you get there.
