00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.350 align:middle line:90%


00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>> You've been learning to
make a deeper connection with

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.760 align:middle line:84%
your heart and
increase coherence.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Now let's explore
what could be possible

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.600 align:middle line:84%
as more and more people make a
connection with their heart's

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.700 align:middle line:84%
intelligence and then come
together in cooperative ways.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.400 align:middle line:84%
It's an adventure
discovering the power

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.590 align:middle line:90%
of the heart of humanity.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Rather than separation
and discord,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.590 align:middle line:84%
we can create a heart-based
movement of increased heart

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.250 align:middle line:84%
qualities, such as
compassion, empathy,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.020 align:middle line:84%
and connection, leading to
more coherence in society.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Heart connection is on
the rise because people

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.820 align:middle line:90%
are yearning for it.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.280 align:middle line:84%
It is true that there
are competing agendas

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.780 align:middle line:90%
in today's world.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Yet, there is plenty
of hopeful news

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.220 align:middle line:84%
to consider in the midst
of the stress and chaos.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a process of a new
world birthing itself

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.850 align:middle line:90%
in the midst of the old one.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:90%
Awareness is shifting.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.420 align:middle line:90%
People are changing.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.000 align:middle line:10%
Society is transforming.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.500 align:middle line:84%
What we call social
coherence is on the rise.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Social coherence has to do
with the relationships amongst

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.690 align:middle line:90%
the members of any group.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.510 align:middle line:84%
So this could be a
family, could be a work

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.590 align:middle line:84%
team, a whole company, or even
cities and even countries,

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.390 align:middle line:90%
ultimately.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Coherence has to do
with how harmonious

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.660 align:middle line:84%
are the relationships
amongst the parts.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, say, a family
would be the whole family.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.020 align:middle line:84%
How well are the members in
that family or that work team

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.700 align:middle line:90%
getting along with each other?

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, it really relates
to the emotional connections

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:90%
between people.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And this allows for good
communication and cohesion

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.880 align:middle line:84%
of the collective action at
the family or group level

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:90%
when we're more coherent.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.480 align:middle line:84%
What's really interesting
from a research perspective

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.270 align:middle line:84%
is there's multiple different
types of studies now

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.810 align:middle line:84%
that are indicating that
when people are in a group

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and they form emotional
relationships that this

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.690 align:middle line:84%
actually create an
energetic field of sorts

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.957 align:middle line:90%
amongst that group.

00:02:01.957 --> 00:02:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Which is really
interesting because it

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.090 align:middle line:84%
means that information can
be shared amongst the group

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.660 align:middle line:84%
members at an unseen
and unconscious level.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>> We were 54 people.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.810 align:middle line:10%
And we met to set a
new Brazilian record,

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.170 align:middle line:10%
building a formation
during freefall.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And this usually
takes about a week.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So we spent a few days
together making a few attempts.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And all the athletes have all
the skills to actually make

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.500 align:middle line:90%
the record happen.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.240 align:middle line:84%
But in the first couple
of days of attempts

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.290 align:middle line:84%
we were not quite getting
together in freefall.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.820 align:middle line:84%
There was a little bit
of rush and some stress,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.390 align:middle line:84%
and people were not
really getting in sync.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>> In the third day, I was
feeling that this kind of feel.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.580 align:middle line:10%
We weren't in sync.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.590 align:middle line:10%
So we were ready to go, we
were going to the plane,

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.500 align:middle line:10%
and then I called everybody.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.970 align:middle line:90%
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.840 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And then all the
people look to me.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.090 align:middle line:90%
Come on, come on.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And everybody stands
in front of me.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I use one technique
that we learned here

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:84%
with HeartMath, Quick Coherence,
for five or six minutes.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And then when I felt the
field, and that field

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:90%
was kind of quiet.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Then I felt, OK,
we are ready to go.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Coincidence or not, on
that jump we made it.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>> We broke the record.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>> It's amazing.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and the cool thing
about it is that we could feel

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:54.730 align:middle line:90%
it in the air.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.640 align:middle line:90%
The quietness.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And when we landed,
like, a bunch of people

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.280 align:middle line:84%
they didn't really
know what had happened.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.140 align:middle line:84%
But they said to us, wow,
we could feel the quietness.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.015 align:middle line:90%
And we were at ease.

00:04:10.015 --> 00:04:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>> In flow.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>Every thing was
kind of slow-mo.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.839 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And those electromagnetic
fields being created,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:25.300 align:middle line:84%
produced by the heart, when you
choose to get into your purpose

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.850 align:middle line:84%
and create a coherent signal,
it changes the environment.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
is, if someone

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:84%
who is sitting and having
a really bad day, or you

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.900 align:middle line:84%
might notice that they're super
sad or they're feeling dense,

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.930 align:middle line:84%
is your literal broadcast of
the heart can help uplift them.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is it
creates this beacon of hope.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.250 align:middle line:84%
It creates almost
a sense for others,

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.220 align:middle line:90%
like, hey, this is possible.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>> We need to rely on each
other now more than ever.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.680 align:middle line:84%
We need to open our
hearts to each other.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.670 align:middle line:10%
We need to approach
these situations

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.380 align:middle line:10%
with everyone's collective
interest in mind,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.510 align:middle line:10%
not just our own
as the individual,

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:10%
not just our own as a part
of a group or even a nation.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.980 align:middle line:84%
We are a collective
consciousness,

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.350 align:middle line:84%
and we need to start
acting like it.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.230 align:middle line:90%
And that is where I find hope.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Coming from a 30-year
law enforcement background,

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I've seen every kind of type
of violence there is out there.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And I would love to see a world
with less or no violence in it.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.150 align:middle line:84%
I know that may sound
like a pipe dream,

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.233 align:middle line:90%
but I think it's possible.

00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:28.090 align:middle line:84%
If we commit to
changing ourselves,

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.890 align:middle line:84%
have that emotional
self-responsibility.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think that will ripple out
to the world in a profound way

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.870 align:middle line:84%
to help see those
changes come about.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So the potential
of social coherence.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Once we understand the
physiology for the individual,

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.180 align:middle line:84%
for the family,
for the workplace,

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.810 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to use techniques
that actually help us activate

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.470 align:middle line:84%
that coherent communication,
that help us shift and lift

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.830 align:middle line:84%
each other's vibes,
we can do that

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.310 align:middle line:84%
and see what outcomes
we create together

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:84%
that can be not only
harmonious, but solve

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.950 align:middle line:84%
a lot of miscommunications
in a lot of social problems.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.170 align:middle line:90%
It's worth playing with.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Social coherence enables a
collective heart intelligence

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.620 align:middle line:10%
that helps raise
the vibratory rate

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.920 align:middle line:10%
of the individual's and the
group's energetic field.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.710 align:middle line:10%
Social coherence is
happening more and more.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.530 align:middle line:10%
As groups of people make
efforts to collectively open

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.920 align:middle line:10%
their hearts, put aside
negative attitudes and judgments

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.030 align:middle line:10%
of others, to work cooperatively
for the benefit of the whole,

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.870 align:middle line:10%
it adds to a momentum of
positive change, which

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.130 align:middle line:10%
is what will help society
to reshape itself.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.130 align:middle line:84%
You contribute to creating
more social coherence

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.390 align:middle line:84%
with each act of kindness you
show to others or to yourself.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.420 align:middle line:84%
You often do it informally
without knowing it,

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.560 align:middle line:84%
simply through the positive ways
you show up and lead your life.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.720 align:middle line:84%
You do it through
the heart qualities

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.340 align:middle line:84%
that radiate through your
heart's electromagnetic field

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.230 align:middle line:90%
into the environment.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.560 align:middle line:84%
As more of us cultivate a
positive energetic field

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.990 align:middle line:84%
of the heart within
and around us,

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.160 align:middle line:84%
in our families, workplaces,
communities, and world,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.850 align:middle line:84%
we regenerate our life and
others physically, mentally,

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.520 align:middle line:90%
emotionally, and spiritually.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:41.860 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
We're going to experience
one more HeartMath technique

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.650 align:middle line:84%
called the Heart
Lock-In technique,

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.160 align:middle line:84%
designed to help amplify the
power of your heart qualities

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and intentions and the
radiation from your heart's

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:55.660 align:middle line:90%
energetic field.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:08.080 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Close your eyes and
ease into your heart.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.970 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Focus your attention in
the area of the heart.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine your breath
is flowing in and out

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.910 align:middle line:84%
through your heart
or chest area,

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.865 align:middle line:84%
and breathe a little slower
and deeper than usual

00:08:28.865 --> 00:08:31.670 align:middle line:90%
in an even rhythm.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:32.840 align:middle line:90%
Do that now, if you would.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Now activate and sustain
a regenerative feeling,

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.830 align:middle line:84%
such as appreciation,
care, or compassion.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:52.620 align:middle line:90%


00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you can recall
a memory when you really

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.420 align:middle line:84%
felt good inside,
when you really

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.860 align:middle line:90%
felt connected with your heart.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:07.840 align:middle line:90%


00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.270 align:middle line:10%
Maybe it was being in a
special place with someone

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.310 align:middle line:10%
you really love and care about.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:17.105 align:middle line:10%
Maybe imagine yourself right
now with a pet you love,

00:09:17.105 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:10%
or in a very special
spot in nature.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:38.960 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Now radiate that renewing
feeling to yourself and others.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:47.190 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Just let the feeling expand and
radiate to every single cell

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:90%
in your body.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.210 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Imagine it's renewing
and energizing you.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.455 align:middle line:84%
Feel like you're
sitting in the warm sun,

00:10:10.455 --> 00:10:12.900 align:middle line:84%
if there's a warmth
radiating from your heart.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:31.420 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:84%
See this warmth permeating
all the different cells

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:39.460 align:middle line:84%
in your body, permeating your
mental and emotional nature,

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:84%
providing a sense of renewal
from the warmth and beauty

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.540 align:middle line:90%
of your heart.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:11:00.850 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's radiate the
feeling outward.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:07.790 align:middle line:90%


00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:11.000 align:middle line:84%
You might want to start by just
radiating care and compassion

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.910 align:middle line:84%
into the environment
that you're in right now,

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:84%
filling that environment with
a warm, energetic feeling

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:17.940 align:middle line:90%
from your heart.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:33.840 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Now radiate it out into the
community that you're in.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps radiate heart
energy to a person,

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:84%
someone you care about,
someone you know who

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.980 align:middle line:90%
needs more heart in their life.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:12:04.720 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Now expand it and radiate
the feeling to the world,

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.340 align:middle line:84%
to humanity itself,
or to an area

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.250 align:middle line:84%
on the planet in need of more
of your heart's compassion.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.880 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Just feel a gentle
radiation coming out

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.660 align:middle line:84%
from the core of
your heart, streaming

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.680 align:middle line:84%
through your being
and the environment,

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.060 align:middle line:90%
and then out to humanity.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:43.550 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:90%
If your mind wanders, it's OK.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Just gently bring your
attention back to the heart

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.645 align:middle line:84%
and try to stay
with the feeling.

00:12:50.645 --> 00:13:11.250 align:middle line:90%


00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.100 align:middle line:84%
As you practice this,
eventually the heart energy

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.860 align:middle line:84%
you're radiating will lock into
a flow towards your highest

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:18.660 align:middle line:90%
intention.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:25.780 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Take the feeling you have
now forward into the future.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Try for a moment to disengage
from the chaos you often

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.190 align:middle line:84%
see in society and
think about this.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:40.060 align:middle line:84%
What if many more
people came to realize

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.840 align:middle line:84%
the transforming potentials
available within the heart

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.470 align:middle line:90%
of who they truly are?

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.090 align:middle line:84%
That what they have
sensed about heart

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:52.780 align:middle line:84%
is real, that by connecting
with their heart's guidance

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.400 align:middle line:84%
they can better
manage their emotions,

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.590 align:middle line:84%
experience more compassion,
appreciation, love,

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:01.360 align:middle line:90%
and connectedness.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.920 align:middle line:84%
What if increasingly
people unleashed

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:09.130 align:middle line:84%
the coherent alignment of heart,
mind, nervous system, emotions,

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and spirit to
access their heart's

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.200 align:middle line:84%
intuitive guidance
for navigating

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.550 align:middle line:90%
their daily interactions?

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.980 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.620 align:middle line:90%
What would our world be?

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Do you see a more
socially coherent world?

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.000 align:middle line:90%
