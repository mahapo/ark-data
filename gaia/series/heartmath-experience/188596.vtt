00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, your biological heart
is doing more than you may have

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.330 align:middle line:90%
imagined.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.940 align:middle line:84%
In recent years,
neurocardiologists

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.260 align:middle line:90%
have made an exciting discovery.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.970 align:middle line:84%
They found that the heart has
its own independent nervous

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.309 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.840 align:middle line:84%
This complex system is referred
to as the brain in the heart.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.270 align:middle line:84%
It sends signals
to the brain that

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.110 align:middle line:84%
are transmitted to the amygdala,
the emotional processing

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.130 align:middle line:90%
center.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.560 align:middle line:84%
To the thalamus,
which synchronizes

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:84%
as our cortical functions and
affect our higher brain centers

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.970 align:middle line:84%
that are responsible for clarity
of thought and decision making.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.600 align:middle line:84%
The brain also send
signals to the heart,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.480 align:middle line:84%
mostly to raise or
lower our heart rate.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:84%
But when researchers look
at the information traffic

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.270 align:middle line:84%
in the body, it's clearly
seen that the heart

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.845 align:middle line:84%
sends a lot more information
to the brain than it receives.

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:56.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.970 align:middle line:84%
Brain function is critically
dependent on this information.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Heart and brain are in
constant communication.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.850 align:middle line:84%
The heart is doing
most of the talking.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.860 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Here's another interesting
scientific fact.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.350 align:middle line:84%
The heart is an
electrical organ,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.840 align:middle line:84%
producing by far
the strongest source

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.730 align:middle line:90%
of rhythmic bioelectricity.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.260 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.680 align:middle line:84%
This energy goes to
every cell in your body.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Your heart produces
enough electrical energy

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:84%
to create a magnetic field
surrounding your body in 360

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.130 align:middle line:84%
degrees, extending beyond the
skin out into space, measurable

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.370 align:middle line:90%
about 3 feet outside your body.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Magnetic fields
contain information.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.590 align:middle line:84%
We imprint our
own magnetic field

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.090 align:middle line:84%
through what we're
actually feeling,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.165 align:middle line:90%
the emotions that we're feeling.

00:01:52.165 --> 00:01:53.790 align:middle line:84%
But then it gets even
more interesting.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like your magnetic
fields relate to one another

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.420 align:middle line:90%
they exchange information.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So how is my field affecting
your field right now,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:90%
and your field affecting mine?

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And a great analogy
for this is cell phones.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.510 align:middle line:84%
The way this works
is our phone is

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.699 align:middle line:84%
generating an electromagnetic
field, in this case.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And the magnetic
field is carrying

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.990 align:middle line:84%
that information, our
voice or the photo

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.693 align:middle line:90%
or the text message or whatever.

00:02:17.693 --> 00:02:20.110 align:middle line:84%
So then when I talk about the
magnetic field of the heart,

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.160 align:middle line:90%
it's the same thing.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So we can fairly easily measure
that not only are we radiating

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.270 align:middle line:84%
these magnetic fields, but
our nervous systems are

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.430 align:middle line:84%
tuned to these fields
and receive information

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:90%
from others.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:84%
So what this means
is that there is

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.760 align:middle line:84%
a very real energetic or
magnetic communication

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.460 align:middle line:84%
system going on between
people all the time.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.958 align:middle line:84%
And another part of the reason
that I think the understanding

00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:84%
the energetic communication
that goes on between people

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.470 align:middle line:84%
is so important is
in miscommunication.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.690 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest sources
of stress between people

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.870 align:middle line:84%
is when you might
be saying one thing

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.270 align:middle line:84%
but our field is
saying something else.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.695 align:middle line:84%
And that leaves them with a
disconnect or a confusion.

00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Because our words
said one thing,

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.222 align:middle line:84%
but we might have been
sending another signal

00:03:04.222 --> 00:03:05.430 align:middle line:90%
through our energetic system.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.040 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>> When our heart-brain-body
communication is working well,

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:84%
we can enter a state of
being in sync with ourself,

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.210 align:middle line:90%
a state of higher coherence.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:84%
So what is coherence and
why is this important?

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Coherence is a healthy
measurable state.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.970 align:middle line:84%
The term refers to the
co-operative alignment

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.450 align:middle line:84%
between heart,
mind, and emotions.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.730 align:middle line:90%
Higher coherence is good for us.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a healthy state
that regenerates us.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.430 align:middle line:84%
It directly contributes to
increased emotional balance,

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:84%
stability, access to intuition,
and improved mental functions,

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.940 align:middle line:84%
such as the ability to
focus, mental clarity,

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.950 align:middle line:84%
bigger-picture thinking,
memory, improved reaction times,

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.570 align:middle line:90%
and coordination.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Coherence is often
triggered by an experience

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.290 align:middle line:84%
of regenerative uplifting
emotions, like those long

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.910 align:middle line:84%
associated with the
qualities of the heart,

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.970 align:middle line:84%
such as love, care, kindness,
appreciation, and compassion.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.829 align:middle line:84%
And it helps us generate more
of these heart qualities.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Coherence can be
measured using technology

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.340 align:middle line:84%
that measures the beat-to-beat
changes in the rhythmic beating

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.580 align:middle line:84%
patterns of the heart, like
HeartMath's Inner Balance

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:90%
Trainer.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.470 align:middle line:84%
This is called heart rate
variability analysis.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a measure of the naturally
occurring beat-to-beat changes

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.150 align:middle line:90%
in heart rhythm.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.320 align:middle line:84%
It serves as a critical method
for gauging human health.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Coherence is a broad term in
that it embraces many things,

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.160 align:middle line:84%
like synchronization,
entrainment,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other terms
that we use in physics.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:84%
But coherence always implies
that the parts of a system,

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.580 align:middle line:84%
like within our body, for
example, are communicating.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.410 align:middle line:90%
There has to be communication.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And that those subsystems, or
different parts of our body,

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.060 align:middle line:84%
are working together in
a harmonious and energy

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.323 align:middle line:90%
efficient way.

00:05:05.323 --> 00:05:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, coherence is
something that's called,

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.090 align:middle line:84%
actually medically,
psychophysiological coherence,

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.973 align:middle line:84%
which means it's both
physical and psychological.

00:05:12.973 --> 00:05:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Physically what's happening when
we're in a high coherent state,

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:84%
is all the major
body systems are

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.930 align:middle line:84%
synchronized to an
ordered rhythmic beating

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.730 align:middle line:90%
pattern of the heart.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.510 align:middle line:84%
That's things like respiration,
digestion, immune system

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.280 align:middle line:84%
response, hormonal response,
and brain function.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.080 align:middle line:90%
They all sync up.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
it's a very healthy state.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.993 align:middle line:84%
And it's also a high
performance state.

00:05:33.993 --> 00:05:36.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, all the systems
are working together well.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Less energy is being wasted,
reaction speed times improve,

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.100 align:middle line:90%
visual field changes.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.000 align:middle line:84%
All of that happens when we get
in this high coherent state.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So that improves not
only our mental functions,

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:84%
but also our autonomic
nervous system,

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.890 align:middle line:84%
which controls 90% of the
body's involuntary functions,

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.810 align:middle line:84%
from hormonal to immune response
to how we sleep, digestion.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.230 align:middle line:84%
If we can get all those
systems in sync or coherent,

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.080 align:middle line:84%
then we have better
health, better wellness,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.620 align:middle line:84%
as well as more clarity and
better connections and feelings

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.660 align:middle line:90%
with ourselves and others.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So we can navigate through
these stressful external

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.200 align:middle line:84%
situations with much
greater ease and composure.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So that what's
happening in the outside

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.230 align:middle line:84%
doesn't cause us as much stress
because our internal systems

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:90%
are in sync and coherent.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Now here's the
psychological part.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Coherence is naturally
triggered when

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.190 align:middle line:84%
we are experiencing a
regenerative uplifting

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.098 align:middle line:84%
emotion, like the
qualities of the heart.

00:06:36.098 --> 00:06:37.640 align:middle line:84%
When I'm more
appreciative, I'm going

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:90%
to be naturally more coherent.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:84%
When I'm being caring to someone
rather than judging them,

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be
naturally more coherent.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really the body's
natural resonant state.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And love, care, compassion,
these heart qualities

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.300 align:middle line:90%
are like oil for the system.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.210 align:middle line:90%
They help create that state.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Stressful emotions create a
chaotic heart rate variability

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.860 align:middle line:90%
pattern.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Lower coherence.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Incoherent heart rhythms created
by our emotional responses

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.360 align:middle line:84%
start to shut down some of our
higher thinking capacities.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.570 align:middle line:84%
This can cloud our judgment,
ability to discern,

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:17.530 align:middle line:90%
and make good choices.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.900 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Sustained regenerative
emotions create

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:32.610 align:middle line:84%
a smooth and ordered pattern,
which indicates high coherence.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.550 align:middle line:84%
When people are feeling
sincere regenerative

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.910 align:middle line:84%
heart-based emotions, such
as love, appreciation,

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and compassion, their heart
rhythm pattern naturally

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.580 align:middle line:90%
becomes more coherent.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.610 align:middle line:84%
These coherent heart
rhythms send signals

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.360 align:middle line:84%
to the brain that open up
our higher brain functions.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.020 align:middle line:90%
We get smarter.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:58.780 align:middle line:84%
You see, your brain is a big
winner when we're coherent.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Practicing heart coherence
for even a few minutes

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.200 align:middle line:84%
lifts your vibration, making
it possible for your heart's

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.860 align:middle line:84%
