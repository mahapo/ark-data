00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on Cosmic Disclosure,
we are with Ricardo Gonzalez,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.320 align:middle line:10%
author and researcher from Peru
who has experienced multiple

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.470 align:middle line:10%
direct contacts with
extraterrestrial species called

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.460 align:middle line:10%
the Apunians.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Today we are talking about
different types of contact.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.030 align:middle line:90%
Ricardo, welcome to the show.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>> You have had direct contact
in the physical and 3D level

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.590 align:middle line:90%
with the Apunians.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.947 align:middle line:90%
How did that work?

00:00:45.947 --> 00:00:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) Yes.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, I've
had physical contact

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:84%
with these extraterrestrials
with human appearance,

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and these experiences have
also happened in the company

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.450 align:middle line:90%
of other witnesses.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the only one
who has found themselves

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.930 align:middle line:90%
face to face with these beings.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.050 align:middle line:84%
However, the question is, how
do these contact agreements

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.070 align:middle line:84%
work with an
extraterrestrial entity?

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:84%
When I've had to share my
testimony with the media,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.560 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they've
labeled me as being

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.180 align:middle line:90%
abducted by extraterrestrials.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.150 align:middle line:84%
I would try to correct the
journalists saying I was not

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.370 align:middle line:90%
taken against my will.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.770 align:middle line:84%
It was a contact by
mutual agreement.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.490 align:middle line:90%
How does this work?

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.000 align:middle line:84%
They extend an invitation to
those people who they feel

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.400 align:middle line:84%
would be appropriate
for an experience.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.810 align:middle line:84%
When I say people who are
ready for an experience,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean people who are
more evolved than others.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean people who can
handle the experience

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:84%
and who would also be
willing to talk about it.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.990 align:middle line:84%
What would be the point of
having an extraordinary contact

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.100 align:middle line:84%
experience if afterwards, due to
fear, you keep it to yourself?

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.140 align:middle line:84%
So having contact depends a
little more on them than on us.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, having this type
of relationship over time

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.150 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials,
some of us

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.700 align:middle line:90%
had to go through a training--

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.390 align:middle line:84%
a training which took
years for some of us.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I had a training for
almost three years

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.940 align:middle line:84%
in order to see one of these
beings for the first time.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.420 align:middle line:84%
This training consisted of
meditation and concentration

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.290 align:middle line:84%
techniques and
also of education.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I changed my paradigms,
my perspectives,

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.410 align:middle line:84%
about possible encounters
with extraterrestrials.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And at the final stage of this
training, this being suggested

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:84%
that we go to the
mountains or deserts

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.860 align:middle line:84%
completely alone
for several days

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.470 align:middle line:84%
under all types of conditions so
that we could face our fears--

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:84%
our loneliness so that
we could hear ourselves.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.200 align:middle line:84%
I went through all of
that before I saw them

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>> What were some of
the challenges, Ricardo,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
through those three years
that you found were a little

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.288 align:middle line:84%
difficult to get through, if you
could explain to our viewers?

00:03:06.288 --> 00:03:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) I think--

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.080 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to be very
honest as always, Emery--

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.270 align:middle line:84%
what was the most
difficult for me at first

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.030 align:middle line:84%
was to be alone in the
desert for several days

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.030 align:middle line:84%
because we humans are
not used to being alone.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.220 align:middle line:90%
We are social beings.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.100 align:middle line:84%
That's why the pandemic of
2020 affected us so much,

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.760 align:middle line:84%
like a negative
emotional contagion,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.820 align:middle line:84%
due to social distancing
and the lockdown.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.400 align:middle line:84%
We humans are social
beings, Emery,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.910 align:middle line:84%
so being in the middle of
the desert three, five, seven

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.160 align:middle line:90%
days alone was really hard.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.660 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of nowhere with
nothing around for miles,

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.930 align:middle line:84%
I began to feel
great discomfort,

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.870 align:middle line:84%
yet I didn't know why
I was uncomfortable.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>> What other types of contact
are there that you can share

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.676 align:middle line:90%
with us?

00:03:53.676 --> 00:03:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) Aside from these

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.810 align:middle line:84%
physical encounters
that I always describe

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:84%
in my interviews, for which I
went through the training that

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.160 align:middle line:84%
I just described, there
are other types of contacts

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and encounters
with these beings.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.020 align:middle line:84%
One of them that we discussed
is the dimensional portals.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Another is telepathic
or mental communication.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Another way of contact is
through the dream world

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.839 align:middle line:84%
where you can project
your consciousness

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:84%
to other realms of reality even
though it sounds unbelievable.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Many esoteric groups call
this astral body projection.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.120 align:middle line:84%
There are also
contact experiences

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:84%
that are stimulated by sound,
whether through mantras

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.290 align:middle line:84%
or power words, as was
done in ancient India,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.950 align:middle line:84%
or through music, just
like what happened

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.520 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the movie "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind,"

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.430 align:middle line:84%
which, by the way, is
based on real events.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>> There are, of course, the
three dimensional contacts that

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.130 align:middle line:84%
you have, but there's also
interdimensional contacts.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.005 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain that?

00:04:56.005 --> 00:04:57.838 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) Basically,

00:04:57.838 --> 00:05:00.440 align:middle line:84%
there are two types of
dimensional portals and contact

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.560 align:middle line:84%
experiences with
extraterrestrials;

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.040 align:middle line:84%
the planet's natural ones, as we
spoke about in another episode,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and the artificial ones that
these extraterrestrial beings

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.330 align:middle line:90%
can generate.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials refer to
artificially generated vortexes

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.970 align:middle line:84%
as Sendras, and there are
four kinds of Sendras--

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.970 align:middle line:84%
due to their physical and
energy characteristics

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:84%
and due to the experience
itself within those vortexes.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:34.160 align:middle line:84%
The first two Sendras, type 1
and type 2, are more physical.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.560 align:middle line:84%
You can see energy
with greater clarity,

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.320 align:middle line:84%
almost as if it was a
bright, compact fog,

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and you can put your hand in
it, and you no longer see it.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And temperature
and characteristics

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:84%
within that
dimensional portal are

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:84%
different than the context
where you were before.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.130 align:middle line:84%
In the type 1 experience,
it tends to be individual.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.540 align:middle line:84%
The energy is organized by the
extraterrestrials for just one

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.380 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Type 2, up to seven
people may enter.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And the next types,
3 and 4, which

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.720 align:middle line:84%
are called Himbra, a
name that was coined

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.360 align:middle line:84%
by the extraterrestrials
themselves,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.640 align:middle line:84%
large groups of
people may enter,

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.890 align:middle line:90%
possibly more than 12 people.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:24.790 align:middle line:84%
But the experience is more
mental, more holographic,

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.290 align:middle line:90%
more spiritual.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And the physical characteristics
of the Sendra, Himbra

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.977 align:middle line:90%
together are also more subtle.

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:35.560 align:middle line:84%
They gave us a
suggestion and training

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.295 align:middle line:84%
to face these dimensional
portals, especially

00:06:39.295 --> 00:06:43.210 align:middle line:84%
for type 1, Sendras,
because all of the energy

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.370 align:middle line:90%
was organized for you--

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.100 align:middle line:84%
adjusted to your
physical body, adjusted

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:90%
to your brain, your mind.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.560 align:middle line:84%
So you should enter there
as balanced as possible

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.200 align:middle line:84%
because the influence of
that energy field is greater.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.290 align:middle line:84%
So if they tell us,
on such and such a day

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:06.210 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be a type 1
Sendra contact on Mount Shasta,

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.920 align:middle line:84%
they would suggest
a certain diet

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
for seven days, particularly a
fruit and vegetable-based diet,

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.130 align:middle line:90%
no meat.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:84%
They also would suggest
avoiding alcohol and, of course,

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:84%
any substance that might
generate an out-of-the-ordinary

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.580 align:middle line:90%
state of consciousness.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.400 align:middle line:84%
They would say that our body
had to be as pure as possible

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.060 align:middle line:84%
in order to withstand
large energy fields.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And the extraterrestrials
were right.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.340 align:middle line:90%


00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.810 align:middle line:84%
There were people
who said, I'm not

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.240 align:middle line:84%
going to follow a
diet for a week,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.250 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going to be
fasting the day of the contact.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And when they would
face the experience,

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.720 align:middle line:84%
they would feel sick,
they would get headaches,

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.830 align:middle line:84%
they would throw up, and
they would fall asleep.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.670 align:middle line:84%
The more energy field influence
you have, the more prudent

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.520 align:middle line:84%
you should be about
what you drink and eat.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>> There are very intelligent
people out there that say they

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.910 align:middle line:84%
talk to extraterrestrials
in their mind.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.417 align:middle line:90%
Is that some sort of contact?

00:08:07.417 --> 00:08:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) Of course,

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.340 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about telepathy.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:16.110 align:middle line:84%
But if either of us goes to
a psychiatrist right now,

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and we tell them that
we are speaking mentally

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.300 align:middle line:84%
with an extraterrestrial
entity, they would probably

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.920 align:middle line:90%
prescribe something for us.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.540 align:middle line:84%
They might think
that we're crazy.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.850 align:middle line:84%
However, we do need
to make a distinction

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.810 align:middle line:84%
between hallucinations
and mental disorders

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:84%
and authentic contact
experiences that

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.809 align:middle line:84%
occur within the
context of telepathy.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:39.270 align:middle line:84%
The word "telepathy"
comes from Greek.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:43.770 align:middle line:84%
In Greek, "tele" means
"far" or "distance."

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And "path" in Greek means
something like a sensation

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.420 align:middle line:84%
or a symptom or a
disease or symptom.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So telepathy could be described
as transmitting something--

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.050 align:middle line:90%
a sensation, a sign, a symptom--

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.280 align:middle line:90%
over distance.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not a language.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not structured
like English or Spanish.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a collection of
information-- feelings, images,

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:09.750 align:middle line:90%
sensations--

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.000 align:middle line:84%
but if it comes
to you, your brain

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.220 align:middle line:84%
will encode it in your native
language, which is English.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.670 align:middle line:84%
If I receive it, I
will comprehend it

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.250 align:middle line:90%
in my native language, Spanish.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.490 align:middle line:84%
That's why telepathy is
the universal language

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.020 align:middle line:90%
of the cosmos.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.240 align:middle line:84%
But there's an
important point here.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:84%
How can I confirm that
telepathic contact?

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Because anyone can say, I'm
receiving telepathic messages

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.550 align:middle line:90%
from extraterrestrials.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.510 align:middle line:90%
Are they really receiving them?

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who says, I
remember my past lives,

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.420 align:middle line:84%
are they really
remembering that?

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.480 align:middle line:84%
If someone says, I'm channeling
this information and this is

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.450 align:middle line:84%
my truth, are they
really channeling it?

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.910 align:middle line:90%
How can you prove it?

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Because if we fall into that,
if it resonates with you,

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.140 align:middle line:90%
it's true.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.270 align:middle line:84%
That's a little dangerous
because it's all

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.610 align:middle line:84%
based on your faith
and your perception.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.760 align:middle line:84%
You may resonate with the
charisma of that person

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.610 align:middle line:84%
but not with the purity
of the phenomena itself.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.280 align:middle line:84%
What these extraterrestrials
suggested to us

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.520 align:middle line:84%
is to have an element
of verification.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.420 align:middle line:84%
That proves that the telepathic
communication was authentic.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Within the types of
contact, in order

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.380 align:middle line:84%
to confirm that these
telepathic experiences are real,

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.580 align:middle line:84%
we would ask these beings
for a physical sign.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:84%
For example, I remember that in
Peru, something extraordinary

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.160 align:middle line:90%
happened in 1999.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.680 align:middle line:84%
I had only been receiving
these telepathic messages

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.200 align:middle line:84%
from the extraterrestrials
for a few years.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.860 align:middle line:84%
I had had small but
important confirmations,

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.590 align:middle line:84%
and I had even had
direct contact with them.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Then suddenly I
started receiving

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:84%
a chain of really important
messages full of information.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:84%
This information would
come to me telepathically.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.790 align:middle line:84%
I would hear the information
in my own language in my head,

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and I would write it
down in a notebook

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.440 align:middle line:84%
so that I wouldn't
lose the information.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.960 align:middle line:84%
I said, they're going
to have to confirm this.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And they told me that in the
first few months of 1999,

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:84%
there was going to be
a wave of UFO sightings

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.070 align:middle line:84%
that was going to be filmed
by a lot of TV networks,

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.720 align:middle line:84%
and that these
objects were going

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.890 align:middle line:84%
to fly over the capital of
Peru, over the city of Lima.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.060 align:middle line:84%
They appeared on the
dates that they said.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Right in the middle of the
city of Lima, they were filmed.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And the Peruvian Air Force
had to create an office

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.260 align:middle line:84%
for UFO investigations, which
didn't exist before that.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.240 align:middle line:84%
I was invited to
the opening ceremony

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.870 align:middle line:90%
of that military office.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.310 align:middle line:84%
So all telepathic
contact, at some point,

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.290 align:middle line:90%
needs verification--

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:52.670 align:middle line:84%
physical proof, a concrete
sign, or that their information

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.380 align:middle line:84%
may be verified
correct over time.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.800 align:middle line:84%
That will give
you the confidence

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.410 align:middle line:84%
to continue that
telepathic connection.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the difference
between telepathy

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.290 align:middle line:90%
and channeling?

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) There's a very

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:08.990 align:middle line:84%
important difference between
telepathy and channeling.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:10.880 align:middle line:84%
To begin with, we
should understand how

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.970 align:middle line:90%
the term "channeling" started.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a modern term that
originated primarily

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.450 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:24.080 align:middle line:84%
On one hand, from
information and testimonials

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:84%
of American actress
Shirley MacLaine.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.900 align:middle line:10%
Prior to that, through
the famous books of Seth,

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.930 align:middle line:10%
the channeling of Seth,
sharing and writing

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.920 align:middle line:10%
in books information
that they perceived.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.520 align:middle line:84%
The phenomena of having
information or energy enter

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.460 align:middle line:84%
an individual began to
be called "channeling."

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.970 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, this
started to get distorted

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:52.790 align:middle line:84%
because, suddenly, the supposed
channels began to introduce

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and incorporate into their
bodies non-human energies that

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.730 align:middle line:84%
they would attribute to
extraterrestrial spirits--

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:06.860 align:middle line:84%
spirits from the past, from lost
civilizations, or even angels--

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and they would
talk through them.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:84%
I should say that it even
became a big business in order

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.090 align:middle line:84%
to speak on these
topics, for people

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.460 align:middle line:84%
to hear a message
that they channeled

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.670 align:middle line:84%
from an angel or an
extraterrestrial.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.003 align:middle line:84%
>> Could it be actually
dangerous to do that?

00:13:22.003 --> 00:13:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) To be able to hear

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.640 align:middle line:84%
these messages in those
channeling sessions,

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.280 align:middle line:84%
you had to pay big
amounts of money.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.160 align:middle line:84%
So for me, channeling
started to become distorted.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there are
authentic channels

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:39.770 align:middle line:84%
who perceive information
from the cosmos

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.420 align:middle line:84%
or external
information that they

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.630 align:middle line:90%
may interpret and communicate.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very
different thing, Emery,

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.750 align:middle line:84%
to allow an entity to
enter into your body.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.610 align:middle line:84%
No matter how much you
call it "channeling"

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and make it sound nice,
it's becoming a medium,

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.690 align:middle line:90%
and that's dangerous.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:03.520 align:middle line:10%
Even the father of spiritism,
well-known Allan Kardec,

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.510 align:middle line:10%
warned of the dangers
of embodying spirits.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.820 align:middle line:84%
There are very few
people who can withstand

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.680 align:middle line:90%
this type of experience.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Many circles of mediums still
practice it, particularly

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.930 align:middle line:84%
in Brazil, but
it's not something

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.370 align:middle line:90%
to recommend to people.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.770 align:middle line:84%
According to my
contact experience,

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.980 align:middle line:90%
modern channeling is dangerous.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Separating authentic cases
from fraudulent ones,

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:33.040 align:middle line:84%
telepathy is a contact method
that is efficient and safe.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.070 align:middle line:84%
It's natural because it
even happens spontaneously

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.500 align:middle line:84%
between human beings,
like when you're

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:43.060 align:middle line:84%
thinking about a person who
you haven't seen in years

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.550 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly they
call you on the phone,

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.910 align:middle line:84%
or when your child is
thinking about a song

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.220 align:middle line:84%
and you start singing
it in the shower.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.820 align:middle line:84%
This happens spontaneously
among us as humans.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.640 align:middle line:84%
Or when a child suffers
a small accident,

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.930 align:middle line:84%
and their mother, who is
at home many miles away,

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.180 align:middle line:90%
feels it immediately.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.820 align:middle line:84%
There are cases of children
who have fallen and bumped

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.600 align:middle line:84%
their knee, and
their mom is cooking,

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly her
knee starts to hurt,

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:15.610 align:middle line:84%
and she was thinking
of her child.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:19.450 align:middle line:84%
My point is that telepathy
is a natural method

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:23.410 align:middle line:84%
of communication, and embodying
an entity into your body

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:24.550 align:middle line:90%
is not.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.100 align:middle line:84%
You are transgressing
higher laws.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people believe
we can initiate contact.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Other people believe that
the extraterrestrials

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.960 align:middle line:90%
initiate contact.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.450 align:middle line:90%
What can you say about that?

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) I believe that

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.890 align:middle line:84%
contact stems from the
agenda of these beings.

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And to maintain that across
time, preparation is needed.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.945 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
you an example.

00:15:48.945 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:84%
A hundred of us get together
somewhere in the United States.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:58.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine here in
Colorado, in Crestone.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.130 align:middle line:84%
We set up our camping
chairs, and we

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:02.830 align:middle line:90%
start looking up at the sky.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:07.150 align:middle line:84%
We could start to practice
meditation and concentration

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:12.580 align:middle line:84%
exercises with positive thoughts
and desire with all our hearts

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.090 align:middle line:84%
to have some kind of
contact with these beings.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.270 align:middle line:90%
It could happen.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.870 align:middle line:84%
After these 100 people being
in this mental condition

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:25.320 align:middle line:84%
in Crestone, which is
a place of contact,

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.370 align:middle line:84%
that an object appears, that
there is a UFO sighting,

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:84%
or even some type of
paranormal experience

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.630 align:middle line:90%
linked to these beings.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that can happen.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:40.720 align:middle line:84%
But the question is, every time
those 100 people get together

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.480 align:middle line:84%
in Crestone and
do the same thing,

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.950 align:middle line:84%
is the phenomena
always going to happen?

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:50.030 align:middle line:84%
The answer is no, and
this is because it also

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.830 align:middle line:90%
depends on an agenda.

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:55.130 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a convergence
of pure intentions

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:59.210 align:middle line:84%
that also corresponds to
the agenda of these beings.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.633 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there any technology
that can help initiate contact?

00:17:01.633 --> 00:17:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) We've talked about

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.569 align:middle line:90%
this on other occasions, Emery.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there
are technologies

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.790 align:middle line:84%
that attempt to initiate
contact with them.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:12.980 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that much
more than technology,

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.339 align:middle line:84%
it's related to
consciousness, as we've said.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:18.349 align:middle line:10%
I remember the first
time that I visited

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:22.130 align:middle line:10%
the Arecibo Observatory
in Puerto Rico, which

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.349 align:middle line:10%
we know recently collapsed.

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.450 align:middle line:10%
When I was there
in Arecibo speaking

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:30.110 align:middle line:10%
with some scientists who
were trying to intercept

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:34.290 align:middle line:10%
signals from a possible
extraterrestrial civilization,

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:10%
and they had not gotten
anything conclusive for them.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.660 align:middle line:10%
Researchers like Jorge
Martin in Puerto Rico,

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.020 align:middle line:10%
they had a lot of evidence--
pictures of these objects

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.640 align:middle line:10%
over the Arecibo telescope
and in the El Yunque area,

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.290 align:middle line:10%
also in Puerto Rico.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:52.940 align:middle line:90%
What I want to say is this.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.300 align:middle line:84%
As we attempt to develop
technology to initiate contact

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.270 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials,
they are already

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.880 align:middle line:84%
able to initiate contact
through our minds,

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.710 align:middle line:90%
through our intentions--

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.540 align:middle line:84%
intentions that,
like I said, are

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.480 align:middle line:90%
in alignment with their agenda.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Even-- and I'd say this with a
great deal of respect but from

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.023 align:middle line:90%
a critical point of view--

00:18:14.023 --> 00:18:15.440 align:middle line:84%
that at the Apple
Store, there are

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.460 align:middle line:84%
apps to try to initiate
contact with extraterrestrials.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.400 align:middle line:84%
I think that this is a way of
undermining what is happening

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.120 align:middle line:90%
in the field, right?

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I love the gadgets
to bring out the lasers

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.040 align:middle line:84%
and the electromagnetic
field, TriField Meters.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.925 align:middle line:84%
It's OK for you to have
that for your confirmation.

00:18:34.925 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) I agree with you,

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Emery, that some of the tools
to study the UFO phenomena are

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.630 align:middle line:90%
good.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.910 align:middle line:84%
For example, my
own research team

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:52.970 align:middle line:84%
uses lasers, night vision,
infrared cameras, et cetera,

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.120 align:middle line:90%
but not to achieve contact--

00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.260 align:middle line:84%
just as tools for study and
verification, nothing more.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And it is true too that when we
have had those gadgets turned

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:84%
off, we've been able to focus
more on the experience itself,

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.330 align:middle line:84%
and they have shown themselves
with greater intensity.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:14.690 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
contact technology is us.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people feel like they
have been on a craft and have

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:90%
lost time.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.053 align:middle line:84%
What are they
actually experiencing?

00:19:23.053 --> 00:19:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) Within the contact

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:30.260 align:middle line:84%
experiences of the fourth kind,
that would imply being on board

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.910 align:middle line:90%
an extraterrestrial ship.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Allow me to remind the
audience that the encounters,

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:40.130 align:middle line:84%
the close encounters, were
categorized by J. Allen Hynek.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Hynek said that the
first kind of encounter

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.830 align:middle line:90%
was the UFO sighting.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.540 align:middle line:84%
The second kind of
contact was when

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.460 align:middle line:84%
the object would
interact with people

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and there were paranormal
phenomena or landing

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.890 align:middle line:90%
marks on the ground.

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.800 align:middle line:84%
The third kind of contact,
according to Dr. Hynek,

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.000 align:middle line:84%
is when a crew member is
sighted close to the UFO.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, Dr.
Hynek's classification

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.120 align:middle line:84%
inspired the movie "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind"

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.270 align:middle line:90%
by Steven Spielberg.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:16.130 align:middle line:84%
But later in the 1970s, several
Latin American researchers

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:17.720 align:middle line:90%
spoke to Dr. Hynek.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.850 align:middle line:10%
Among the researchers
who spoke to Hynek

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:23.210 align:middle line:10%
was Fabio Zerpa from Argentina.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.780 align:middle line:10%
And Fabio Zerpa told
him, Dr. Hynek, we

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.780 align:middle line:10%
need to add other
categories of contact.

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And Zerpa proposed in the
1970s the close encounter

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.080 align:middle line:84%
of the fourth kind,
when you are physically

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.340 align:middle line:84%
inside an extraterrestrial
ship, and the fifth kind,

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.220 align:middle line:84%
telepathic paranormal
communications.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:84%
That category even
includes radio waves

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.920 align:middle line:84%
that could be picked up
by radio observatories.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.420 align:middle line:84%
So what are we talking
about when a person says,

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.850 align:middle line:90%
I was inside a ship?

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.625 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about a
physical experience--

00:20:55.625 --> 00:20:58.760 align:middle line:84%
one that, in fact, I have
experienced and have previously

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.970 align:middle line:90%
spoken about on Gaia TV.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.740 align:middle line:84%
I also know that
these beings are

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:08.510 align:middle line:84%
able to implant information
into your brain,

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.725 align:middle line:90%
like virtual reality.

00:21:09.725 --> 00:21:12.320 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that this
was my case because

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.420 align:middle line:84%
of a series of
characteristics with a contact

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.190 align:middle line:90%
that I affirm to have had.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.610 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, any
extraordinary affirmation

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:84%
requires an extraordinary
confirmation.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.170 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's such a sensitive
issue when someone says,

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:31.370 align:middle line:84%
I saw myself, I was
on, or I visited

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:33.800 align:middle line:90%
an extraterrestrial ship.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.140 align:middle line:84%
How did you get there
inside that craft?

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.450 align:middle line:90%
Was it in your dreams?

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Did you wake up
and then remember?

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Was it mentally during
a meditation when you

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.200 align:middle line:90%
crossed a dimensional portal?

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Or were you physically
absorbed by a beam of light,

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.870 align:middle line:84%
like Travis Walton, and
taken into the craft?

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:54.380 align:middle line:84%
So there are different types
of contact within a ship,

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.000 align:middle line:84%
and not all of
them are physical,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.980 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
characteristics, the context,

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.420 align:middle line:90%
and the information.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell me about these sounds
that people hear in frequencies

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.947 align:middle line:90%
during these close encounters.

00:22:09.947 --> 00:22:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) Certainly,

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.710 align:middle line:84%
there is a series of physical
characteristics in the context

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.930 align:middle line:90%
of a field contact--

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:23.420 align:middle line:84%
the behavior of animals, the
silence of birds and insects,

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:28.130 align:middle line:84%
the sudden stopping of the wind,
or if the temperature decreases

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:29.930 align:middle line:90%
or increases.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:33.530 align:middle line:84%
According to our contact
experience in the field,

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:37.640 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials have
preferred colder temperatures

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.350 align:middle line:84%
because in colder
temperatures, they're

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:42.050 align:middle line:84%
better able to control
their technology and also

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:45.320 align:middle line:90%
some interdimensional actions.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I also feel that they are
more accustomed to colder

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.200 align:middle line:84%
temperatures than very
high temperatures.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.960 align:middle line:84%
When the temperature
goes up too much

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.900 align:middle line:84%
in the field in a
certain area, you

00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.440 align:middle line:84%
are seeing a dimensional
portal being created.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.825 align:middle line:84%
And another phenomena that
you're asking me about--

00:23:02.825 --> 00:23:05.300 align:middle line:84%
about the tones
and frequencies--

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.400 align:middle line:90%
they are like musical notes.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:12.440 align:middle line:84%
I have heard them, and I have
been so fascinated by them

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.550 align:middle line:84%
that, as a musician myself,
I have created musical pieces

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.620 align:middle line:90%
inspired by those sounds.

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there extraterrestrials
living amongst us?

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) Yes, of course.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Within the kinds
of contact, there

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:33.410 align:middle line:84%
is also infiltration, a type
of fifth column among us--

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:39.110 align:middle line:84%
beings that look very similar to
us or extraterrestrial entities

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:44.360 align:middle line:84%
who have the capacity to mutate
in order to look like us.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.190 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
very interesting cases

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.320 align:middle line:90%
about this in ufology.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:53.120 align:middle line:84%
For example, a sighting on
a beach in Spain, in Cadiz.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.300 align:middle line:84%
After some sightings
of UFOs over the ocean,

00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:84%
to see these beings transform
into everyday people

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.920 align:middle line:84%
like us, wearing
a shirt and pants

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and walking like
any normal person.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:11.930 align:middle line:84%
In our contact experience,
they have presented themselves

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:17.810 align:middle line:84%
as people, and they have
infiltrated our meetings.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.180 align:middle line:90%
We have later identified them.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Because, can you
imagine if you're

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.380 align:middle line:84%
in a meeting with a
large group of people,

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.450 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly one of
those sitting there,

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:29.120 align:middle line:84%
who you don't know, is
one of these beings?

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.830 align:middle line:84%
When we've experienced
that, we've

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.230 align:middle line:84%
been able to keep it
quiet and discreet.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And we ask them, why
have you done this?

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:39.080 align:middle line:84%
They answered, although
we are able to monitor you

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:43.280 align:middle line:84%
telepathically at a distance,
living the human experience

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.650 align:middle line:84%
with you gives us a
different perspective.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do you think they're
contacting humans now more than

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:49.890 align:middle line:90%
ever?

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) I believe that

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.810 align:middle line:84%
they have renewed contact
with human beings at this time

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:56.180 align:middle line:84%
because of the times
that are coming--

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.480 align:middle line:84%
contacts with the
precision of a surgeon--

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.840 align:middle line:84%
so that they won't have too much
of an impact on our free will,

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.250 align:middle line:90%
our own timeline.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.630 align:middle line:90%
They want to warn us.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:10.190 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
directly affect events

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:12.770 align:middle line:84%
so that they won't create
what is known as the butterfly

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:13.910 align:middle line:90%
effect--

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:16.160 align:middle line:90%
the distortion of timelines.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have any predictions
in the near future in terms

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.330 align:middle line:90%
of contact?

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.497 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) Once again, Emery,

00:25:22.497 --> 00:25:24.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be very
honest with you.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.450 align:middle line:84%
In the last messages that
I received from them,

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:31.580 align:middle line:84%
particularly in
2019, they warned me

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.460 align:middle line:84%
that a period would come, a
very important and conflicted

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.490 align:middle line:90%
period, for our humankind.

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:42.020 align:middle line:84%
In the month of January
2020, after a camping trip

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.560 align:middle line:84%
to southern Chile,
they made known to me

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.650 align:middle line:84%
that I would spend several
months confined to my home.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:51.090 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't believe
that that could happen.

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:53.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm always traveling--
on the move.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I thought that I was
going to get sick,

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:59.150 align:middle line:84%
that I would be ill at
home for several months,

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:01.460 align:middle line:90%
like they showed me in a dream.

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.080 align:middle line:90%
Then this pandemic came.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.610 align:middle line:90%
And so I understood.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them,
what happens next?

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:09.380 align:middle line:84%
They said, for now, we
cannot give you more details

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.380 align:middle line:84%
because you all are going
through your big test.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.960 align:middle line:84%
That is not just the
pandemic, but everything

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.140 align:middle line:84%
that is behind it, and you
all have to face it alone.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Then as soon as you
all pass this phase,

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.060 align:middle line:84%
something new will come,
and we will be there,

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.290 align:middle line:90%
if you are ready.

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:25.760 align:middle line:90%
You have to be strong.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Ricardo, that was beautiful.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show again.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, my friend.

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.550 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:47.446 align:middle line:90%
