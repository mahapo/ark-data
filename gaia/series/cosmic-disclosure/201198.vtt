00:00:19.187 --> 00:00:21.020 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.140 align:middle line:10%
we are talking about ET craft
with Peruvian researcher

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.390 align:middle line:10%
and author, Ricardo
Gonzalez, who

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.330 align:middle line:10%
has multiple contacts with
extraterrestrial species called

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.530 align:middle line:10%
Apunians.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.558 align:middle line:90%
Ricardo, welcome to the show.

00:00:32.558 --> 00:00:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RICARDO GONZALEZ:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Ricardo, we
talked about 3D experiences

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.640 align:middle line:90%
and channeling.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.910 align:middle line:84%
But those are two
different kind of things.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.880 align:middle line:90%
Explain those to us.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: Truly, they
are different experiences.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.345 align:middle line:84%
When you speak about
physical contact,

00:00:50.345 --> 00:00:52.470 align:middle line:84%
you are talking about
something that you could see.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.730 align:middle line:90%
You could even touch.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:84%
It's happening
within your 3D world.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.180 align:middle line:84%
But when we are talking about
the phenomena of channeling,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.230 align:middle line:84%
it's more a mental, even
spiritual experience.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.710 align:middle line:84%
But it also has its
complexities and misperceptions.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Because some people confuse
extrasensory perception

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.670 align:middle line:84%
with the inspiration
of their own conscious

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and with the help of
unknown deities and entities

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.620 align:middle line:84%
that reminds you of
practices from the occult.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
that mix all of that

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.140 align:middle line:90%
and call it channeling.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.872 align:middle line:84%
And that misperception
is dangerous.

00:01:26.872 --> 00:01:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Why is it dangerous?

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Could they be getting the wrong
message from the wrong entity?

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: Any entity that
has an evolved consciousness

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.930 align:middle line:84%
and respect for the
human being would not

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.810 align:middle line:84%
need to integrate itself
into our physical vehicle.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:84%
Because at that point,
it is transgressing

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:90%
past the free will protocol.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.770 align:middle line:10%
There are other forms
of contact that are

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.710 align:middle line:10%
less invasive and more secure.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.370 align:middle line:10%
Allan Kardec, the
father of spiritism,

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.920 align:middle line:10%
understood these types
of spiritual topics.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.370 align:middle line:84%
He had warned back then about
the danger of inviting entities

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.740 align:middle line:90%
into your vehicle.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And some people that call
themselves channelers

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.440 align:middle line:84%
are actually
functioning as mediums.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Other problems I
see with channeling

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.680 align:middle line:84%
is that everything is based on
what resonates with that person

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.140 align:middle line:84%
so that if the person
who is listening to you

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.870 align:middle line:84%
feels that what you are
telling is the truth, then

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.450 align:middle line:90%
it's the truth.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And though it is important
to listen to your heart

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:84%
and intuition, when you leave
everything to your perception,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.850 align:middle line:84%
then it becomes an act of
faith, more of a belief.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.720 align:middle line:84%
This is the slippery
slope in channelings.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Based on my understanding,
yes, of course,

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.340 align:middle line:90%
there are authentic channels.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.340 align:middle line:84%
They are the people that
are able to be in a place.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And they can
perceive information

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.210 align:middle line:84%
from the universe
or other planes.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And they can integrate it
into their consciousness.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.220 align:middle line:10%
And they're able to share
this information, perhaps

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.020 align:middle line:10%
the case of Edgar Cayce,
known as the sleeping prophet.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.820 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
cases of channelers

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.880 align:middle line:90%
that, for me, are confusing.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:84%
The word was made popular by
the actress Shirley MacLaine

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.250 align:middle line:84%
after the publication of
her book, "Out on a Limb."

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.090 align:middle line:84%
When she appeared
in various shows

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.280 align:middle line:84%
here in the United
States in the 1980s,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.010 align:middle line:84%
the term channeling
became very popular.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.260 align:middle line:84%
That's why it is
important to differentiate

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.890 align:middle line:84%
that type of experience from
direct contacts with ETs.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.520 align:middle line:84%
It's not that one way is
better or worse than the other.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the means that
are more subtle and spiritual--

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.820 align:middle line:84%
they need some type of
verification and contrast

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.140 align:middle line:84%
so that it doesn't fall on
deliriums and exaggerations.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it possible that
the own person's mind could be

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.750 align:middle line:90%
subjective in the channeling?

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GONZALEZ: Yes, absolutely.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.700 align:middle line:84%
This is possible that a
witness of channeling,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.030 align:middle line:84%
that a person who believes he
or she is receiving messages

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.610 align:middle line:84%
from a being of another
dimension, that feels

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.780 align:middle line:90%
like an inspiration.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.060 align:middle line:84%
It could be that it
is not an entity that

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.830 align:middle line:90%
is foreign to him or herself.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:90%
It could be just him or herself.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.540 align:middle line:84%
It could be a very intelligent
and pure part of themselves

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.910 align:middle line:84%
that is flowing through
a different type of state

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:84%
that the person is in, and that
it can communicate thoughts

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.459 align:middle line:90%
to the person.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.070 align:middle line:84%
It is possible
that the channeler,

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.420 align:middle line:84%
without realizing it, creates
some archetype, some type

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.400 align:middle line:84%
of projection that
is foreign to him

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.800 align:middle line:84%
or herself that could
become disguised

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.960 align:middle line:84%
as some type of
Pleiadian entity,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.600 align:middle line:84%
or a warrior from
Lemuria, or some type

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.930 align:middle line:90%
of magnetic consciousness.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't necessarily
have to be that.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.090 align:middle line:84%
More so, when you
make conditional

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.240 align:middle line:84%
that in your workshop you
don't have as many people

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.390 align:middle line:84%
or you don't get
paid enough money,

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.522 align:middle line:84%
you're not able to channel
that benevolent being.

00:04:50.522 --> 00:04:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Ricardo,
have you ever had

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.490 align:middle line:90%
an experience in a 3D craft?

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.400 align:middle line:10%
>>GONZALEZ: On other occasions
in different interviews,

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.220 align:middle line:10%
I have spoken about the physical
contact that I have had with

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.160 align:middle line:10%
these beings on Earth, including
with other witnesses that have

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.830 align:middle line:10%
been there that include
well-known journalists

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.950 align:middle line:10%
of the UFO phenomena, like
the case of Paola Harris,

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:10%
here in the United States, that
saw the entity that I've been

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.520 align:middle line:10%
referring to--

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.860 align:middle line:10%
Antarel.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.100 align:middle line:84%
But these contacts have
not just happened on Earth.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.070 align:middle line:84%
On two occasions, I was able
to have face-to-face contacts

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.780 align:middle line:84%
with these beings
inside of a ship.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm referring to
a contact of consent.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.870 align:middle line:90%
I was invited.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.200 align:middle line:84%
I remember the last time
that I experienced something

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.000 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Where was this at?

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: I've
had two experiences

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.250 align:middle line:90%
where I entered these ships.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
The first one was in
Peru in the desert.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And the second one, the
last one that I experienced,

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:84%
was here in the United
States in Mount Shasta.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Both experiences
were very similar,

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.900 align:middle line:84%
because I was taken inside of
the ship in the same manner.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Explain how
you entered the craft.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And where were you at the time
that you entered the craft?

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.710 align:middle line:90%
What was that dynamic like?

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: In both
experiences that I had--

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.400 align:middle line:84%
the first one in 2001 in
Peru, the second one in 2012

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:90%
in the United States--

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.390 align:middle line:84%
the way I entered the
ship was the same.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.580 align:middle line:90%
It was a column of light.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.860 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like somebody
was shining a light from above.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.870 align:middle line:90%
It was a soft light.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.350 align:middle line:84%
It was like the light of the
full moon, until the moment

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.960 align:middle line:84%
when it yanked me
from the ground.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:90%
The light became more intense.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And it became so intense
that I had to close my eyes.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.650 align:middle line:90%
I was blinded by it.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you're
inside of the object

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.000 align:middle line:84%
and you experience
physical sensations.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.580 align:middle line:84%
I was in a sense
of emotional shock.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a very
particular sensation

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.820 align:middle line:84%
in my stomach, a
dizzying feeling

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.950 align:middle line:90%
and a pressure in my head.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.450 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like you're on
the top of a roller coaster

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.610 align:middle line:90%
and you have a freefall.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And that is the way I found
myself in a circular room.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.780 align:middle line:84%
It was filled with a very
intense white light that

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:84%
was actually similar to the
column of light that had first

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:07.170 align:middle line:90%
appeared.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you see
your feet and your body?

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GONZALEZ: Yes, I was there.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.350 align:middle line:90%
My whole body was there.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I
appeared there suddenly

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.700 align:middle line:84%
and started to walk around
like nothing happened.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.560 align:middle line:90%
I could look at my clothes.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.320 align:middle line:84%
I touched myself, my
clothes, what I was wearing.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.400 align:middle line:84%
There was a huge contrast
between what I was wearing,

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and my clothes, and my person
to the atmosphere that I was in.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could
you see the floor?

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: Yes, I was
able to see the floor.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.790 align:middle line:84%
There was a very small circle,
probably no more than a meter

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.980 align:middle line:90%
of circumference.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.560 align:middle line:84%
It had some geometric figures,
almost like small pentagons.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was pulsating
a soft blue light,

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.280 align:middle line:84%
but only in the circle
where I was standing.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.330 align:middle line:84%
In the main floor of the
vehicle, everything was white.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.568 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you
judge distance inside?

00:07:57.568 --> 00:07:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: In this case
that I'm speaking about,

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:01.430 align:middle line:84%
which was my first
experience, that

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.770 align:middle line:84%
happened in the desert
in Chilca in Peru.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.680 align:middle line:84%
The circular room
itself was more or less

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.460 align:middle line:84%
what I would say to be
about 10 meters in diameter.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:84%
But later, I went to
another part of the vehicle.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And there I found another
circular room that was larger.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm not able to calculate
the measurements

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.320 align:middle line:90%
of that object for two reasons.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.130 align:middle line:84%
I was only in two
places of the vehicle.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And I never saw the
object from the outside

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.150 align:middle line:90%
to be able to have any context.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.919 align:middle line:84%
So the column of light first
descended from some fog cloud.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:37.159 align:middle line:84%
And the object was actually
hiding within this fog.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.679 align:middle line:90%
It was surrounded in light.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In the first
experience inside, did you

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.360 align:middle line:84%
see anything besides
the white light?

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Were there any beings or any
objects inside the craft?

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: In this room
where I found myself,

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.200 align:middle line:84%
the only thing that I was able
to distinguish with clarity

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.380 align:middle line:84%
was an oval door that
was pretty large, that I

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.790 align:middle line:84%
had this feeling that
I had to go through it,

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.130 align:middle line:90%
but I wasn't able to.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.300 align:middle line:90%
Initially, I couldn't.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.260 align:middle line:90%
I was very afraid.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.690 align:middle line:84%
My heart was beating
really, really fast,

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.200 align:middle line:84%
like I was running very, very
fast, but I was standing there.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.730 align:middle line:90%
My hands started to sweat.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I was having a hard
time breathing.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was convinced that
I was about to faint.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.170 align:middle line:84%
It was in that moment that
I felt a hand place itself

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:20.340 align:middle line:90%
on my right shoulder.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like
it calmed me down.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And my heartbeat
began to decrease.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:90%
All of a sudden, I was calm.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.080 align:middle line:90%
And I started to feel better.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.630 align:middle line:90%
It was a human hand like ours.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:84%
It was the hand of somebody
with light skin, feminine,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.860 align:middle line:90%
but had no nails.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't unpleasant.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.890 align:middle line:90%
It was just exotic.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.170 align:middle line:84%
When I turned around,
there was a woman there

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.460 align:middle line:90%
dressed in a metallic outfit.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.070 align:middle line:90%
She had very light eyes--

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.470 align:middle line:84%
almond shaped and very
blonde platinum hair

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:53.180 align:middle line:90%
that fell to her shoulders.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Soon after that,
Antarel appeared.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.340 align:middle line:84%
He is a tall
Nordic-looking being.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.750 align:middle line:90%
The woman was not as tall.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:04.370 align:middle line:84%
She was maybe 1.8 meters
in comparison to Antarel

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.030 align:middle line:90%
who is about 2.75 meters.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.370 align:middle line:84%
I would say the way
it's measured in the US,

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.010 align:middle line:90%
he's about 10 feet.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:19.900 align:middle line:84%
They spoke to me mentally,
telling me to calm down,

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.860 align:middle line:84%
to come through the door that I
was unable to enter on my own.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.390 align:middle line:90%
I followed and went with them.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the door led
to some hallway that

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.700 align:middle line:90%
was moving towards the right.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.420 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't very long,
maybe 10 to 14 meters.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I found myself
in the other circular room.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What were they
communicating to you

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:42.610 align:middle line:90%
on the journey through the door?

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: They were
telling me mentally to come

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.780 align:middle line:90%
through that door with them.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.690 align:middle line:84%
All of the communication
was mental.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And something that
really stood out to me

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.800 align:middle line:84%
during this experience
is that there

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.520 align:middle line:84%
were moments of no conversation,
just the way that I'm

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:84%
describing it, like if you
listen to a question mentally

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and then you answer mentally as
well, almost like, how are you?

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you answer,
I'm fine, mentally.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:84%
There are moments when
there was none of that.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.160 align:middle line:90%
There was no conversation.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.690 align:middle line:90%
I just knew.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.490 align:middle line:90%
You just knew.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:18.810 align:middle line:90%
I was moving with them.

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.190 align:middle line:90%
I was following them.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.030 align:middle line:90%
We were joined.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.870 align:middle line:90%
And that did scare me.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Because at first,
it was awkward.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.860 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was walking
naked, just completely exposed.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.190 align:middle line:84%
I felt like they could see
everything inside of me.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And at that same time, I could
feel certain things from them.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.673 align:middle line:84%
It was something very
strange, but very special.

00:11:39.673 --> 00:11:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You did
say, though, when

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:84%
you went into the other
room with this male

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:50.090 align:middle line:84%
and female being, that there
were other beings there.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And I completely relate to you
of feeling naked when you're

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.280 align:middle line:90%
in this energy field they have.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Because the frequency--
what they do is they

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:06.080 align:middle line:84%
change their frequency to
accommodate your frequency.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So the three of you are
sharing all the same energy

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and experience at
the exact same time.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.610 align:middle line:90%
Would you say so?

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: Yes, it's
difficult to explain

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:22.810 align:middle line:84%
why I felt the way that I felt.
I've come up with a hypothesis.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Aside from the
topic of energetics

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.033 align:middle line:84%
that you just described, I
think I just felt embarrassed.

00:12:28.033 --> 00:12:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Not because I have
something negative to hide,

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.730 align:middle line:84%
just because I wasn't
accustomed to that,

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.180 align:middle line:84%
that you have no
private thoughts.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:84%
It's such an intense
connection that

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.600 align:middle line:90%
felt like talking was useless.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.330 align:middle line:84%
It felt like I was connected to
something that was incredible.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:84%
For example, I would see
certain things in that vehicle.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And when I say things,
it's not that it

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:90%
was full of artifacts or stuff.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.130 align:middle line:84%
It was very minimalist
and white and empty.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.380 align:middle line:90%
The few things that I did see--

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:04.420 align:middle line:84%
there was a cylinder with a
crystal dome, a screen of gas

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:90%
or light against a curved wall.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.990 align:middle line:84%
I saw some spheres of
color that were also there.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.580 align:middle line:90%
Where the other entities were--

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.910 align:middle line:84%
they had their hands
submerged into these spheres.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And they looked like
they were in a trance.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.398 align:middle line:90%
And I was just looking at that.

00:13:19.398 --> 00:13:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And just by looking at
it, I knew what they

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:23.100 align:middle line:90%
were doing, what was happening.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And I asked myself,
how do I know this?

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized that I
had established a connection

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:32.080 align:middle line:84%
with their information,
I suppose to the level

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.360 align:middle line:84%
that they allowed
me to stick my nose.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I understood that
these beings that

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.710 align:middle line:84%
were entranced with
their hands submerged

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.840 align:middle line:84%
into these spheres
of light had actually

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.880 align:middle line:84%
integrated their
consciousness with the ship.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.340 align:middle line:90%
This is the way they did it.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a very complex mechanism
that I don't understand

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and that would transform the
vehicle into a live being that

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.550 align:middle line:90%
was connected to these beings.

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:57.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why they allowed
me to know these things.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.998 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were
testing my reaction.

00:13:59.998 --> 00:14:01.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
they didn't bring up

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.150 align:middle line:84%
a scientist, instead
of someone from Peru,

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:06.010 align:middle line:84%
considered a
third-world country.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because there's enough
scientists in space already.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:10.750 align:middle line:90%
That's what they told me.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GONZALEZ: That is true.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.650 align:middle line:84%
But I did understand
why they did it.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:18.820 align:middle line:84%
As I said, to test me, to see
how a common person would react

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:23.980 align:middle line:84%
to something like this and also
to gain my trust a bit more,

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.290 align:middle line:90%
being in their environment.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Because up until that
moment, I had never

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.700 align:middle line:90%
seen this type of apparatus.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.320 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you establish
a friendship with a person.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.810 align:middle line:84%
At first, you have
coffee down the street.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And then when there
is more trust,

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.410 align:middle line:90%
you bring them to your house.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you communicate
with any other beings

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.210 align:middle line:84%
on the craft besides
being connected

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.562 align:middle line:84%
to the craft consciously
and the other two beings?

00:14:49.562 --> 00:14:50.770 align:middle line:90%
There were some others there.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.780 align:middle line:84%
But was most of
the communication

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.675 align:middle line:84%
just instantaneous with the
craft and all the beings?

00:14:55.675 --> 00:14:58.502 align:middle line:90%


00:14:58.502 --> 00:15:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: I maintained
the main communication there

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.780 align:middle line:90%
with Antarel on this ship.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.360 align:middle line:84%
The main interaction
I had was with him.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.460 align:middle line:84%
My interaction with
the woman I described

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.860 align:middle line:90%
was only at the beginning.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And the other three
entities I saw there--

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.740 align:middle line:90%
they were tall and bald.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.290 align:middle line:90%
It was just in that moment.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:19.040 align:middle line:84%
My main host was
Antarel, the one

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I would say I held a
conversation on various topics.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.820 align:middle line:84%
One of them-- I have
already shared with you--

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.710 align:middle line:90%
Project Longshot.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.420 align:middle line:84%
This information--
I received there

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:84%
during this contact
with Antarel.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:36.110 align:middle line:84%
They also spoke to me
about other things,

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.000 align:middle line:84%
about circumstances
that would occur

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.860 align:middle line:84%
in our future that
were going to change

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:43.130 align:middle line:90%
our geopolitical environment.

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:84%
For example, I was told
that they had foreseen

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:90%
in the month of September.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So I'm telling you
six months after I

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.600 align:middle line:84%
had this experience that I tell
you occurred in 2001 in Peru.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.985 align:middle line:84%
They told me that in September,
something really terrible

00:15:56.985 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:84%
was going to happen in New
York, and that it would change

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.220 align:middle line:90%
the geopolitical environment.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I published an
article about this.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And aside from that report, I
gave interviews and conferences

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.840 align:middle line:90%
here in the United States.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:84%
When the incident of 9/11
occurred, I was in shock.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:19.540 align:middle line:84%
I understood then that
the ETs had been referring

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.960 align:middle line:90%
to this very incident.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.900 align:middle line:90%
And they were right.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:26.090 align:middle line:84%
The geopolitical landscape of
the world completely changed.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How do you
think the ETs already

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.510 align:middle line:84%
knew about something six
months from that point?

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:35.130 align:middle line:90%


00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: I suppose
for different reasons.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:41.140 align:middle line:84%
One could be that they travel
through different timelines.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And they were just
simply sharing

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.140 align:middle line:84%
something that had
already happened,

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.070 align:middle line:84%
but without offering any
details about what was coming.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:54.517 align:middle line:84%
They just marked a timeline,
a place, and the consequence.

00:16:54.517 --> 00:16:56.100 align:middle line:84%
They didn't say that
a plane was going

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.810 align:middle line:90%
to go through the twin towers.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.068 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Did it scare you?

00:17:00.068 --> 00:17:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: I'm actually going
back to that moment right now.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:06.660 align:middle line:90%


00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.554 align:middle line:84%
And your question is surprising
me, because I felt more things.

00:17:09.554 --> 00:17:13.530 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:16.619 align:middle line:84%
I felt more trust to their
abilities and their capacities,

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:18.569 align:middle line:90%
but I was also in shock.

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Because I was there at the
twin towers one week before it

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.020 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.119 align:middle line:84%
I was walking in Manhattan,
passing under them

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:25.230 align:middle line:90%
in the street.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.270 align:middle line:84%
There were so many people
that were just walking

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:28.890 align:middle line:90%
at the feet of those towers.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:32.220 align:middle line:84%
I had given an interview to
a radio station in Manhattan.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.230 align:middle line:84%
I was just able to see
the amount of people

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:35.970 align:middle line:84%
that were moving
through that place

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:38.930 align:middle line:90%
and then to see what happened.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.620 align:middle line:84%
That act of violence
and the thousands

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.930 align:middle line:84%
of people that
were taken made me

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.150 align:middle line:90%
think about our human history--

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:46.425 align:middle line:90%
our wars, our violence.

00:17:46.425 --> 00:17:48.990 align:middle line:90%


00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.600 align:middle line:84%
If these beings know
so much about us,

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.410 align:middle line:90%
how come they didn't stop it?

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:58.100 align:middle line:84%
If I was one of the people that
they gave this information to,

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.750 align:middle line:84%
why did they do
that if I don't have

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.510 align:middle line:90%
any real weight in the matter?

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't they speak to someone
that had some influence that

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.092 align:middle line:90%
could change the events?

00:18:07.092 --> 00:18:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Isn't it possible
that maybe the event

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:13.020 align:middle line:84%
had to happen for us to
get to where we are today?

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: Yes,
probably that's why.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they
didn't want to talk.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.375 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.375 --> 00:18:23.980 align:middle line:84%
But something is pending
with your question, Emery.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.600 align:middle line:90%
How did they know?

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.140 align:middle line:84%
One way, as I said, could be
that they follow information

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.700 align:middle line:90%
from different timelines.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And another one could
be much more simple.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:37.060 align:middle line:84%
It could be that they intercept
all of our communications,

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.740 align:middle line:84%
maybe a great deal
of information

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.500 align:middle line:84%
with all this
technology they have.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.930 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they already
knew that something

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:49.430 align:middle line:84%
was being organized, that
something was gestating,

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.320 align:middle line:90%
whoever it was that did it.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they probably
have access to time travel.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.530 align:middle line:10%
Because that's the only way they
could do that or have access

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.420 align:middle line:10%
to see the future and the past.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe this has
already happened.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
recording of that.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.960 align:middle line:90%
And they wanted to show you.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: It is true that
because they do time travel,

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.030 align:middle line:90%
they have access to information.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this privileged
information

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.900 align:middle line:90%
was shared with contactees.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.240 align:middle line:84%
But we still come to
the same question--

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.060 align:middle line:84%
why matters that are so
delicate and important

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:24.170 align:middle line:84%
have been transmitted to people
that are common such as myself.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of many people
that this has happened to.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:30.060 align:middle line:84%
They want to generate a
type of civil pressure.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:30.860 align:middle line:90%
I said it before.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Since the witnesses
of high credibility

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.720 align:middle line:84%
are unwilling to
open their mouths,

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.570 align:middle line:84%
they are trying to pressure
a certain type of liberation

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.540 align:middle line:84%
of information through the
movement of a lot of people

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.330 align:middle line:84%
in the world that are also
getting to know the truth.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.980 align:middle line:90%


00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:51.330 align:middle line:84%
So not just the elite of the
Earth, just normal people.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of
creating pressure so

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.963 align:middle line:90%
that things will become known.

00:19:54.963 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is also something
that we spoke about

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.170 align:middle line:90%
while I was in the vehicle.

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I feel your compassion
of what has happened to you.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.260 align:middle line:90%
And I understand.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
let you know that.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:08.130 align:middle line:84%
But I also want to
ask you, how many

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:12.090 align:middle line:84%
normal people does it take to
create peace in this planet?

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:16.540 align:middle line:90%


00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.165 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: I am
actually investigating

00:20:18.165 --> 00:20:22.380 align:middle line:84%
a potential number that I think
a lot of investigators do know,

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.930 align:middle line:84%
investigators that are
familiar with the ancient Mayan

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.980 align:middle line:84%
traditions and
Pueblo traditions.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:35.910 align:middle line:84%
These traditions talk about a
dance of 144,000 warriors that

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.800 align:middle line:84%
are skipping and
beating the drums so

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.580 align:middle line:84%
that a sacred fire in the middle
of the dance does not turn off.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.470 align:middle line:90%
It is to keep the fire on.

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.670 align:middle line:84%
They are called the
144,000 dancers of the sun.

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:49.800 align:middle line:84%
I started to investigate
other traditions.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And the same number
keeps coming up.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:58.100 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible, it also talks
about 144,000 marked by God.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.960 align:middle line:84%
I am not saying that
they are the chosen,

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.080 align:middle line:84%
but there has to be
some mathematical clue.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we should
begin symbolically

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:08.210 align:middle line:84%
and mathematically speaking,
maybe just starting

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:11.090 align:middle line:84%
with 144,000 people
that could change

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:14.300 align:middle line:84%
their level of consciousness
to maybe generate this domino

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.230 align:middle line:90%
effect.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, the Gaia viewers
might think, oh, that's so easy.

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:22.280 align:middle line:84%
144,000 people is nothing in
contrast with the population

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.150 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:26.300 align:middle line:84%
But remember the legend
of the Indian people.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:31.080 align:middle line:84%
When one dancer stopped dancing,
the fire would turn off.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:35.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
144,000 people awakening.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.950 align:middle line:90%
It's to maintain it.

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.010 align:middle line:84%
So maybe the people that
are watching this interview

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.420 align:middle line:84%
are in synchronicity
with this message.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.630 align:middle line:84%
But when they turn
off the TV or maybe

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.050 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow or maybe next week
when they get mad at something,

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:51.420 align:middle line:90%
how will they be?

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.250 align:middle line:90%
It's true we are human.

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:57.220 align:middle line:84%
We can have differences in our
character and our perceptions.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.020 align:middle line:90%
It's normal.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:58.860 align:middle line:90%
We are human.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.220 align:middle line:84%
What I'm talking about
here is to maintain,

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:06.940 align:middle line:84%
to try to stay awake, not
to allow the fire to go out.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:10.080 align:middle line:84%
So if I had to throw out
a number or just a number

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.890 align:middle line:84%
to start, I would
consider this legend.

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.340 align:middle line:90%
Excellent, excellent.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.780 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Ricardo.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to get back to the
second craft that you boarded.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:26.210 align:middle line:84%
You said it was similar
to the first craft.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And I want to know if
there was any differences,

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:30.740 align:middle line:84%
but let's start
from the beginning.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Was it also a beam of light?

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:35.300 align:middle line:90%
Where was it at, first?

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.880 align:middle line:90%
Mount Shasta, you said?

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: As I
said, the experiences

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.340 align:middle line:84%
were quite similar in
the way that they took me

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:47.780 align:middle line:84%
into the vehicle and the
description of the vehicle.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.142 align:middle line:90%
The only difference was--

00:22:49.142 --> 00:22:50.975 align:middle line:84%
taking into account
that I didn't experience

00:22:50.975 --> 00:22:53.860 align:middle line:90%
a cognitive distortion--

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.930 align:middle line:84%
is that the second
vehicle, the circular room

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.580 align:middle line:90%
where I found myself--

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.380 align:middle line:90%
it felt bigger.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.690 align:middle line:90%
A lot bigger, actually.

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:05.570 align:middle line:84%
At least twice the size
of my first experience.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't move from
there that time.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.970 align:middle line:84%
I was where I had the
meeting with Antarel.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:13.840 align:middle line:84%
It felt a lot shorter
than the first time.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And I received instructions to
go to Siberia and the Russian

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Federation and to
return to Mongolia

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.260 align:middle line:84%
in the mountains of Altai to
start an investigation that I

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.200 align:middle line:90%
continue to this day.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was there anything
else translated or communicated

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:35.047 align:middle line:84%
to you, other than that mission
that they would like you to do?

00:23:35.047 --> 00:23:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: I believe that
the most important part

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.650 align:middle line:84%
of the contact or the
information that I received

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:84%
in Shasta that occurred on
the 26th of August of 2012

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.090 align:middle line:84%
has been to investigate
the secrets of Central

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Asia and its unknown connections
to the Native American tribes.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.230 align:middle line:90%
It was a genetic project.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:57.830 align:middle line:84%
It was a controlled migration
so that certain characteristics

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:02.730 align:middle line:84%
of an ethnic group of
shamans, of psychics

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:06.330 align:middle line:84%
would not be lost and
come to this region,

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:09.810 align:middle line:84%
and that in the future, this
ability, this sensibility

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and connection to the Earth
could be transmitted to others.

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:17.160 align:middle line:84%
But according to the ETs, not
just to transmit it genetically

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.550 align:middle line:84%
or through lineage, but
through a phenomenon called

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.290 align:middle line:90%
impregnation.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:25.320 align:middle line:84%
It's like the example of a
marriage that cannot have

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.250 align:middle line:90%
children.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.830 align:middle line:90%
And they adopt one.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And with time, that
adopted child starts

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.360 align:middle line:84%
to develop physical traits
of the adoptive parents,

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.880 align:middle line:84%
gets the same allergies
as the adoptive parents.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.230 align:middle line:90%
But how is this possible?

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:39.520 align:middle line:90%
It's not the same blood.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.220 align:middle line:84%
It is the phenomenon
of impregnation.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the descendants
of the sacred lineage

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.310 align:middle line:84%
of Central Asia, the actual
shamans of the Americas,

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:50.680 align:middle line:84%
the genuine and
authentic ones, I

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.740 align:middle line:84%
think, hold the key to
impregnate their wisdom

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.760 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge to the
rest of humanity.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.360 align:middle line:84%
They can impregnate a better
understanding and connection

00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.890 align:middle line:90%
with Mother Earth.

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:02.170 align:middle line:90%
They led me on that road.

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And we have found
incredible things, including

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.190 align:middle line:90%
here in the United States.

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Even in science,
if you are around--

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and this has been
published many times

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:15.970 align:middle line:90%
over that you are a light.

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:19.300 align:middle line:84%
You're made of these photons
and these frequencies.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And we can transfer things
through light from one glass

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.540 align:middle line:90%
to another glass of water.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So I completely understand by
being around two individuals.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And even though
this child is not

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.728 align:middle line:84%
of the womb of this
woman or the sperm--

00:25:34.728 --> 00:25:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GONZALEZ: It's amazing.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --of this
man, they will

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:41.380 align:middle line:84%
take on the traits
of these people 100%.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
happens when you hang out

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.520 align:middle line:90%
with friends and family.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're good or bad, you
will pick up on these traits.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And you'll start to even
sometimes maybe even look

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:54.590 align:middle line:90%
like them.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:55.390 align:middle line:90%
And it's funny.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I always love reading
Tom Bearden's books.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:10%
But there's a couple
studies out there why

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:06.610 align:middle line:10%
dogs look like their owners.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:07.990 align:middle line:90%

transforms and unites.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.455 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: Therefore, if
there are adoptive parents that

00:26:13.455 --> 00:26:16.630 align:middle line:84%
are watching this show today,
the small child that you

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:middle line:90%
adopted, of course, is yours.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Because you are united by
something greater than blood.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.190 align:middle line:90%
You are united by love.

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:26.920 align:middle line:84%
That is what many tribes used
to practice that would easily

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:31.930 align:middle line:84%
call another person brother
or sister without having

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:33.280 align:middle line:90%
to share the same blood.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.550 align:middle line:90%
I believe in that.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is what these
beings have made us remember.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Ricardo, thank you so
much for all that information.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.930 align:middle line:84%
It's always beautiful to be
with you and in your field.

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:47.588 align:middle line:84%
>>GONZALEZ: Thank
you so much, Emery.

00:26:47.588 --> 00:26:48.630 align:middle line:90%
