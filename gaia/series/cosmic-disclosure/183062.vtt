>>EMERY SMITH: We're here
with John Lear today.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.980 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be talking
about the secret underground

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:24.980 align:middle line:90%
waterways.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.860 align:middle line:90%
Hi, John.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN LEAR: How
you doing, Emery?

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Good to see you again.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Nice to see you.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.560 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Man, this is
such an interesting topic.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, my father
was in the Navy.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And on his deathbed told me
a lot of interesting things.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know,
working after the military

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.940 align:middle line:84%
with some other projects, using
underground backscattered radar

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:84%
technology, low
volumetric imaging,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.490 align:middle line:84%
we found a lot of
amazing things.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.490 align:middle line:84%
We were looking for
something else actually,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.740 align:middle line:84%
but we got to see this
underground basically aquifers,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and tunnels large enough
to have submarines.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.730 align:middle line:90%
It's like a tunneling system.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yep.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And when I saw
your map here in the office,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.370 align:middle line:90%
I was just blown away.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Because I used to live right
here in Topanga, in Malibu.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.405 align:middle line:84%
And we would do a lot of
underwater photography

00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:17.280 align:middle line:90%
and trips down there.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.200 align:middle line:90%
But it's a lot deeper than that.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And I met a few agents down
there that verified this.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And I would love for you to
explain your take on this,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:84%
and where it starts, and
how it all got started.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.837 align:middle line:84%
And also, when was the first
time you heard about it?

00:01:32.837 --> 00:01:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: The seven Western states
of the United States actually

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.200 align:middle line:84%
sit on a plate, which
rests on the Pacific Ocean.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.910 align:middle line:84%
The first time I
heard about it was

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.250 align:middle line:90%
Branton, the Branton documents.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago,
maybe 30 years ago,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:84%
I read them, and talked
about the disappearance

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.980 align:middle line:90%
of the Thresher.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Thresher was one
of the very first Navy

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:90%
nuclear submarines.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.600 align:middle line:90%
It disappeared.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And the Navy has done
every possible thing

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.370 align:middle line:84%
to make us believe that it blew
up or disintegrated somehow

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.180 align:middle line:90%
in the Azores.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it was lost
in the Pacific Ocean

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.009 align:middle line:90%
under California or Nevada.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.760 align:middle line:84%
What they had done is
they'd found the entrance.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:84%
In Monterey Bay
there's a canyon that's

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:84%
deep enough that they
can take a nuke sub,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.640 align:middle line:84%
go under, and enter the Pacific
Ocean that's under those seven

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.870 align:middle line:90%
Western states.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And they can go
anywhere they want.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And all that has to
happen on the surface,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.460 align:middle line:84%
they dig down whatever the
length of the plate is.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.790 align:middle line:84%
In the case of Hawthorne
it's 3,400 feet.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:90%
Sandpoint, it's a little more.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.560 align:middle line:90%
Lake Tahoe.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.260 align:middle line:84%
You remember when Jacques
Cousteau did the deep dive

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.250 align:middle line:90%
at Lake Tahoe?

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And when he came up
they said, what'd you see?

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.860 align:middle line:90%
He said, I can't tell you.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.480 align:middle line:84%
The public doesn't need
to know about that.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.820 align:middle line:90%
So he knew in those days.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:53.903 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It was connected.

00:02:53.903 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Branton talked
about the Thresher

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.090 align:middle line:84%
was actually lost under
either California or Nevada.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.755 align:middle line:84%
And one of the crew member's
wife was communicating.

00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Through telepathy?

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Psychically.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Saying, we're alive.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.190 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know where we
are, and we can't get out.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.780 align:middle line:90%
And that was Branton's story.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.180 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
time I heard about--

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What year was that?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Well, that had to be
in the late '70s or early '80s.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: OK.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Then when my folks moved
up to Reno in 1970,

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.190 align:middle line:84%
I would drive from
Las Vegas up there.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And halfway between is this
little town called Hawthorne.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.340 align:middle line:90%
There's a lake, Walker Lake.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: It's 100 feet
deep, 15 miles long.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.290 align:middle line:90%
No big deal.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.150 align:middle line:84%
But when you drive into
Hawthorne from either end,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.640 align:middle line:90%
there's a big blue sign.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I love that sign.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.692 align:middle line:10%
>>LEAR: That says US Navy
Undersea Warfare Center.

00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And it used to say
training center,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.400 align:middle line:90%
but they changed it to center.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.057 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In the
middle of a desert.

00:03:59.057 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: How could that be?

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.600 align:middle line:90%
You have a deep lake submarine?

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.010 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And I tossed that around for
years, and he had been flying--

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.280 align:middle line:90%
We flew over this many times.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Jumped to
be in the cockpit

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.730 align:middle line:84%
with the different airlines
going over this place.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.829 align:middle line:84%
Somebody would say, yeah,
there's a submarine base there.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And never figured
it out until I had

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.200 align:middle line:90%
a good contact in Las Vegas.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.660 align:middle line:90%
He ran a printing shop.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.870 align:middle line:90%
Just a small printing shop.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And he used to give me
so much information,

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.980 align:middle line:84%
because the guys that
would come in there,

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.630 align:middle line:90%
all parts of the industry.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And one was a Navy guy
that worked in Hawthorne.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.380 align:middle line:90%
And they needed some printing.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And when they came
in, he just made

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.090 align:middle line:84%
the comment, hey, is
what John Lear says,

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.330 align:middle line:84%
there's a submarine
base under Hawthorne?

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.207 align:middle line:90%
And the guy went like that.

00:04:45.207 --> 00:04:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I can't believe--

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.555 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:04:46.555 --> 00:04:48.013 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: So that--
he tipped us off.

00:04:48.013 --> 00:04:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And then one thing
led to another.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.020 align:middle line:90%
And we found out, yes.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:84%
They built an elevator
that goes down.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they did
was because the firm that

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.270 align:middle line:84%
makes all the highly
classified weaponage for the US

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.820 align:middle line:84%
nuclear subs is in
that mountain just

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.450 align:middle line:90%
to the Northwest of Hawthorne.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And they used to have to
ship it by truck, either up

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.040 align:middle line:84%
to Reno, and up to
Alameda in San Francisco,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.360 align:middle line:84%
over through Las Vegas
down to San Diego.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.820 align:middle line:84%
But when they found
out that submarines

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.870 align:middle line:84%
could access and actually go
under Nevada and California,

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.390 align:middle line:84%
they dug a large hole
there, 3,400 feet

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.180 align:middle line:90%
deep to the Pacific Ocean.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.898 align:middle line:84%
And they have a huge
underground base.

00:05:35.898 --> 00:05:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And all they have to
do is take this weapon

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and put it on the elevator,
and send it down there.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.763 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Send it
down and they got it.

00:05:41.763 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And the sub goes
out the Monterey Bay.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: John, you
and I know this,

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.600 align:middle line:84%
but how do we actually
explain how the plates--

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:90%
they're not floating.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.980 align:middle line:84%
But they are thousands of
feet above the next level.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.780 align:middle line:84%
This is very deep water
under California and Nevada.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And how do they make
these bases in Nevada?

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Actually, it does float.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.770 align:middle line:84%
The seven Western states
are on a geological plate

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.510 align:middle line:90%
that covers these states.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And this plate floats
on the Pacific Ocean.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.960 align:middle line:84%
So all they need is the
entrance through a canyon that's

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.150 align:middle line:84%
deep enough in Monterey Bay that
lets them access the Pacific

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.950 align:middle line:90%
Ocean.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, I see.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And they can
go anywhere they want

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.370 align:middle line:90%
on these seven Western states.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:90%
They can go to Sandpoint.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.060 align:middle line:90%
They can go to Lake Tahoe.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.830 align:middle line:10%
They can go to China
Lake, where they've

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.860 align:middle line:10%
seen the nuke submarines there
in the middle of the desert.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:90%
Ha!

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And Groom Lake I'm
sure has an access.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And certainly,
Sandia and Tonopah.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: But there's other places
in those seven Western states

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:54.650 align:middle line:84%
where people see a sign that
says US Naval Undersea Center.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.330 align:middle line:84%
You talked about
drilling this 3,500 foot

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.170 align:middle line:84%
entranceway for them, topsoil
all the way at the bottom.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm familiar with underwater
facilities in the Atlantic

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.350 align:middle line:90%
and Pacific Oceans.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.240 align:middle line:90%
Do they have that there as well?

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.370 align:middle line:90%
Or is it just the sub comes up.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.310 align:middle line:84%
It vacuums out like in space
when we're transferring things?

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Or is it actually a
huge center down there

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.887 align:middle line:84%
that people are working at, and
the sub pulls in and comes up.

00:07:25.887 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: The sub doesn't come up.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.910 align:middle line:84%
It sits right at where
the Pacific Ocean has

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.230 align:middle line:90%
its level at zero altitude.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And I mean,
I guess they've

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:84%
been digging tunnels
that wide for years,

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.270 align:middle line:90%
since the early '50s.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.925 align:middle line:84%
So to dig one at
Hawthorne was light duty.

00:07:43.925 --> 00:07:45.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, probably took
them a couple of days

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.050 align:middle line:90%
and they're at 3,400 feet.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:48.650 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm familiar with the way
they used to drill down there

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.555 align:middle line:90%
and make these tunnels.

00:07:53.555 --> 00:07:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Are you familiar with
this one now that

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.615 align:middle line:84%
melts the granite and the rock,
and it looks like a lava tube

00:07:58.615 --> 00:07:59.500 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.263 align:middle line:84%
And you can basically
get a jumbo 747 down it.

00:08:04.263 --> 00:08:05.680 align:middle line:84%
That's how big
these highways are.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.290 align:middle line:84%
I want to give a
spectrum to everyone.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Number one, like what's
the largest nuke sub

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.380 align:middle line:90%
that you're aware of in feet?

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: The new block tube,
Virginia class, the largest one

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.670 align:middle line:90%
that I'm aware of.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.178 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how
many meters is that?

00:08:21.178 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: You know,
I think it's, what?

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.620 align:middle line:90%
600 feet?

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.080 align:middle line:84%
What's the name
of that submarine?

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.120 align:middle line:10%
>>LEAR: Virginia-class Block II.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.510 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: We're talking about
massive submarines going

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle line:10%
under the continental
shelf here.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.039 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: If you're wondering
how do they get in there,

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:38.010 align:middle line:90%
they access it by the canyons.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.659 align:middle line:84%
Now, you could see
on Monterey Bay.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:41.919 align:middle line:90%
Pull up Google Earth.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Famous photo.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.130 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Go down.

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can see this
huge canyon just goes

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.200 align:middle line:84%
to the coastline at
Monterey Bay and stops.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.250 align:middle line:90%
Well, it doesn't stop.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.570 align:middle line:90%
It goes all the way through.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they can do is get

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:57.250 align:middle line:84%
on the bottom of this
canyon and go access

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:00.280 align:middle line:84%
the Pacific Ocean that lies
under these Western states.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is that just a
natural geological formation?

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Or have they actually done more
to clear those areas to get

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:09.735 align:middle line:90%
to these areas?

00:09:09.735 --> 00:09:11.110 align:middle line:10%
>>LEAR: It's a
natural formation,

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.490 align:middle line:10%
just like the one at Malibu.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.278 align:middle line:10%
Now, there's good pictures on
the web of that entrance there.

00:09:15.278 --> 00:09:16.078 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:09:16.078 --> 00:09:16.510 align:middle line:10%
I've seen them.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.550 align:middle line:10%
>>LEAR: And those are
natural formations.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:10%
Now, when I heard the
Branton story of the Thresher

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.430 align:middle line:10%
that was lost, I started looking
at the two nuclear submarines

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.720 align:middle line:10%
that the US Navy lost.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.550 align:middle line:10%
And the one was the Tresher.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.880 align:middle line:10%
And the other was, I'm
thinking, not SkipJack,

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.830 align:middle line:10%
but a name like that.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.730 align:middle line:10%
And the Navy has gone
to unbelievable effort

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:42.370 align:middle line:10%
to hide where those nuclear
submarines disappeared.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.440 align:middle line:84%
One was supposedly
at the Azores.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.970 align:middle line:84%
One was supposedly
in the Pacific.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And I have talked to some of
the guys in the Pentagon Navy.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And they come up with all these
reasons how I could be wrong,

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:84%
but the fact is both
those submarines

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:02.530 align:middle line:84%
were lost in the Pacific
Ocean under one or more,

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.885 align:middle line:90%
either Nevada or California.

00:10:05.885 --> 00:10:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'll tell you
the extent that they

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:12.340 align:middle line:84%
went to to pretend that the
Tresher was lost at the Azores.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.850 align:middle line:90%
The discoverer of the Titanic--

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:21.130 align:middle line:84%
what really happened is Robert
Ballard went to the US Navy

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and asked for some equipment
to help him find the Titanic.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:29.050 align:middle line:84%
The Titanic was found three
years prior by the Navy.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And they did all
the investigation

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.440 align:middle line:84%
they needed to do before they
told anybody about the Titanic.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And they let Ballard
be that discoverer.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And the Navy had already
been there three years.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.850 align:middle line:84%
The agreement that the
Navy made with Ballard

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:49.960 align:middle line:84%
is that he go to the
Azores and take pictures

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.620 align:middle line:84%
of the sunken Thresher
submarine and what

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.440 align:middle line:84%
was left of the debris of
the nuclear reactor, which

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.510 align:middle line:84%
didn't exist at
all, but which he

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.450 align:middle line:84%
did, and filmed
whatever was there

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.040 align:middle line:90%
that they called the Thresher.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And in return for that, they
told him where the Titanic was.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.417 align:middle line:90%
And he discovered it.

00:11:09.417 --> 00:11:11.095 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:11:11.095 --> 00:11:12.817 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Oh, it always
works like that.

00:11:12.817 --> 00:11:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Always someone on
someone's shoulders.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.692 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And then they did
the same thing in the Pacific

00:11:16.692 --> 00:11:18.340 align:middle line:90%
with the one they lost there.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.340 align:middle line:84%
But both of those submarines
were lost somewhere

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.420 align:middle line:90%
under California or Nevada.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And now you say, well, how
do you know for sure, John?

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:30.460 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend that was
in the Navy stationed

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.570 align:middle line:90%
in San Francisco.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And one day he was excavating
wherever he worked.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And that was where they
made maps of all the places

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.170 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And they happened to
have a map of California.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And there was a line from
Monterey Bay to Hawthorne.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.825 align:middle line:84%
And that was the route that
the submarines used there.

00:11:54.825 --> 00:11:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And at first I thought
it was a tunnel.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:56.500 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not a tunnel.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:90%
It's just a whole ocean.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Ocean.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.232 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: That just
happened to be the routes

00:12:01.232 --> 00:12:04.600 align:middle line:84%
that they used from the entrance
at Monterey Bay to Hawthorne.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I can't believe they
couldn't find this submarine

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.150 align:middle line:84%
because of the
technology we have today,

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.270 align:middle line:84%
and also it's like
the ELTs we have

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.600 align:middle line:90%
on the back of our aircraft.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.400 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.015 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Right.

00:12:16.015 --> 00:12:16.390 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:17.973 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They have
the same-- similar.

00:12:17.973 --> 00:12:19.870 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
different frequency.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's harmonics
that I'm aware of that

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.310 align:middle line:84%
if there was something
going on bad that you

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:84%
could pick this
signal up anywhere

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.700 align:middle line:90%
in any ocean around the world.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Remember, Emery,
we're talking 45 years ago.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.170 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have that
technology then.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.145 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:12:36.145 --> 00:12:37.395 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Now, we could have it.

00:12:37.395 --> 00:12:38.195 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:12:38.195 --> 00:12:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: But, of course,
the people are dead.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:90%
The sailors are dead.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.360 align:middle line:90%
And we probably found it now.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.430 align:middle line:84%
But you and I aren't
going to know about it.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How are they
covering up these entrances?

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And are they, of
course, monitored?

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And is there someone
always down there?

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: No.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.103 align:middle line:90%
But it's just outside Fort Ord.

00:12:56.103 --> 00:12:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's always
something there

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.370 align:middle line:84%
because there is a gigantic
UFO base outside of Fort Ord.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: So they don't
have to guard it

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.040 align:middle line:90%
because nobody would be there.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.623 align:middle line:84%
Nobody would have
their own submarine.

00:13:07.623 --> 00:13:09.165 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: A submarine
to go that deep.

00:13:09.165 --> 00:13:10.495 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: To check it out.

00:13:10.495 --> 00:13:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, tell
us about Hawthorne.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.340 align:middle line:90%
We got the map here.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's go over the
entrances, where they are,

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and where they
lead to Hawthorne.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: OK.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:22.030 align:middle line:10%
This is the Monterey Bay
entrance at Moss Landing.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:25.090 align:middle line:10%
And it's the Elkhorn
Slough that you

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.940 align:middle line:10%
can look under when
you go on Google Earth,

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.720 align:middle line:10%
and look at that canyon.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.500 align:middle line:90%
That angle.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.588 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:32.588 --> 00:13:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: This is the Malibu one.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.140 align:middle line:90%
That's also on the net.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.010 align:middle line:90%
Great pictures.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's a great
picture that they took of that.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And they still haven't
covered it up, I don't think.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: No.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:45.160 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to cover up
something that nobody believes.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.330 align:middle line:90%
So this is Hawthorne.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's the route that
they take direct to Hawthorne.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they get
all their super weapon stuff.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.140 align:middle line:90%
This is Lake Tahoe.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's Pyramid Lake.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Pyramid Lake.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.947 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: There's
something at Winnemucca.

00:14:01.947 --> 00:14:03.780 align:middle line:84%
There's always been
something at Winnemucca.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.690 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know what it is.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:08.650 align:middle line:84%
But there's always been some
kind of classified facility

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:09.950 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.710 align:middle line:90%
This one is Lake Mead.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Nellis used to be called
the Navy Lake Mead Station.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Really?

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And they took that Lake
Mead Station out of there

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.860 align:middle line:90%
for some reason.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:28.690 align:middle line:84%
But the underground, or
the undersea Pacific Ocean

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.250 align:middle line:84%
stretched all the
way to Lake Mead.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.530 align:middle line:90%
And there is certainly access.

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:33.550 align:middle line:90%
There was access then.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:36.790 align:middle line:84%
There's probably access now
at Nellis Air Force Base.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, always
something going on there.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:39.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:39.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.548 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what's
up here at Sandpoint?

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: That's Sandpoint.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:47.570 align:middle line:84%
That's the Navy very
highly classified research.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they
have the one quarter scale

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.928 align:middle line:84%
submarines there, checking
all kinds of stuff.

00:14:54.928 --> 00:14:56.470 align:middle line:84%
There's all these
stories about that.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't say is the
actual nuke subs themselves

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.480 align:middle line:90%
can actually go there.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's because it overlies
the Pacific Ocean, just

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.750 align:middle line:90%
like all the seven states.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, we heard stories that
there were nuclear submarines

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.510 align:middle line:90%
in St. Louis, Missouri.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And a guy had been
taken by his father

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:21.920 align:middle line:84%
to where he worked and shown
under wherever it was in St.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.235 align:middle line:90%
Louis, went down these stairs.

00:15:24.235 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
nuclear submarine.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.190 align:middle line:90%
So how did it get there?

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.535 align:middle line:84%
It turns out they sailed
up the Mississippi.

00:15:30.535 --> 00:15:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And when I posted this
on my Facebook page,

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:37.450 align:middle line:84%
somebody came and said,
well, that explains

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.360 align:middle line:84%
why they're always
dredging outside St. Louis.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Because anything that
uses the Mississippi

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.460 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have that
much of a draft.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.600 align:middle line:90%
You know, a couple feet.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:90%
Why would they dredge?

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.867 align:middle line:84%
And they dredge so that the
submarines can then come up.

00:15:51.867 --> 00:15:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I wonder why St. Louis.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.000 align:middle line:90%
What's in--

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: It's because
the company that

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.600 align:middle line:84%
made the electronics that
they were researching

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.210 align:middle line:84%
on this nuclear sub
was located there.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And it'd be too complicated to
move that somewhere that was

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:05.940 align:middle line:90%
easily accessible.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:84%
It'd be easier just to have
the nuclear sub sail up

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:13.060 align:middle line:84%
the Mississippi and
pull into St. Louis.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, the center of all the
Navy stuff is in Memphis.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure that has a huge
submarine facility there.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I was told
that there is a way

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:29.300 align:middle line:84%
to get from the Pacific to
the Atlantic with a sub, not

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.147 align:middle line:84%
the big ones, but a
little bit smaller.

00:16:32.147 --> 00:16:33.480 align:middle line:90%
Do you know anything about that?

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: No.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.340 align:middle line:90%
But I believe that story.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:36.320 align:middle line:90%
I believe it too.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't have anything
to back it up.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.310 align:middle line:84%
But I've heard it
from too many people.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And just by seeing a lot of
the underground facilities

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:84%
through this radar
technology that it seems

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.360 align:middle line:84%
it could actually
be very possible.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Absolutely.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.215 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: John, why
do we go inland?

00:16:53.215 --> 00:16:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Because
the manufacturing

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.990 align:middle line:84%
facility was already
there at Hawthorne.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.640 align:middle line:90%
It was inside the mountain.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So all the stuff, all
the weapons and stuff

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:84%
were shipped out either
up to Reno, and out

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.900 align:middle line:84%
to Alameda and San Francisco,
or south through Las Vegas

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.040 align:middle line:90%
to San Diego.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:84%
But when they found out that
the Pacific underlied Hawthorne,

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and all they had to do
was move an elevator,

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.770 align:middle line:84%
why would they move the
entire facility hidden

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.359 align:middle line:84%
in the mountains
to the coast just

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:27.207 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate the transport
of these facilities?

00:17:27.207 --> 00:17:28.040 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have to.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.840 align:middle line:84%
They just had to dig an elevator
and run all the stuff down

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.640 align:middle line:90%
to the base.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's probably a lot
safer too than having a Naval

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:40.610 align:middle line:84%
base full of subs in broad
daylight, sitting there,

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.600 align:middle line:90%
and being tracked by our--

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.320 align:middle line:90%
You got that right.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: --friends and foes.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.690 align:middle line:84%
I think it's also
a safety factor.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:52.020 align:middle line:10%
>>LEAR: China Lake has obviously
been a very secret Navy

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:52.820 align:middle line:10%
facility.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.700 align:middle line:10%
And it's the Navy's Area 51.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
that goes on there.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.750 align:middle line:84%
So it would just be
natural that they'd

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.030 align:middle line:84%
want to access it with
a submarine, which

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.530 align:middle line:90%
has been seen there.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:84%
It's just to the West of
Edwards Air Force Base.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.140 align:middle line:90%
It's always been low key.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Nobody thinks much
about China Lake,

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.180 align:middle line:84%
because everything
is underground.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And the people that
work there, they're

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:21.170 align:middle line:84%
issued bicycles to go to these
massive underground facilities.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:23.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way to
get around under there.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I've heard
about these things.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And there's
all kinds of things

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.160 align:middle line:90%
that go on there at China Lake.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I haven't heard that
much about them.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I had a very good friend that
worked there for many years.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't tell me
much, unfortunately.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But that is the Area
51 for the Navy.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they
developing craft there?

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Probably.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Emery, one of the things
that Richard Hoagland told

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.390 align:middle line:84%
us about was the lie is
different at every level.

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: So every
level of a clearance,

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:57.860 align:middle line:90%
the lie is different.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:58.723 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:18:58.723 --> 00:19:01.140 align:middle line:84%
You get a little bit more and
more of the truth each time.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Yeah.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Other places, for
instance, Lake Tahoe,

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:08.230 align:middle line:84%
the reason they access
that is SEAL teams

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.500 align:middle line:84%
could go up there
without anybody

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.790 align:middle line:84%
seeing where they were, and
disappear for a couple weeks.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend who was the
original member of SEAL Team

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.200 align:middle line:90%
Six, Scotty Lyons.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.140 align:middle line:90%
He died many years ago.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.290 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't tell me much.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things he told me is

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:28.520 align:middle line:84%
when they went up to Lake Tahoe
they were reporting for duty.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And they would go down the
elevator into the Pacific

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Ocean, and then go
out for somewhere

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.050 align:middle line:84%
when people just thought
they were going up

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:36.646 align:middle line:90%
to Tahoe for a meeting.

00:19:36.646 --> 00:19:37.924 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh.

00:19:37.924 --> 00:19:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And so there's
many reasons why

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:45.130 align:middle line:84%
the Navy wants access to under
the seven western states,

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.050 align:middle line:90%
and possibly more.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.330 align:middle line:90%
For instance, Sandpoint.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Idaho is where they have their
top secret research facility.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And the public is told that
they use that lake there.

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:01.580 align:middle line:90%
And they just use 25% models.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:02.380 align:middle line:90%
But they don't.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.040 align:middle line:90%
They use the real thing.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.492 align:middle line:84%
And they access it with the
access to the Pacific Ocean.

00:20:07.492 --> 00:20:08.950 align:middle line:84%
They could just
sail the submarines

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.520 align:middle line:90%
and go up the lake bed.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Sandpoint, the
lake there is known

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.990 align:middle line:84%
to be one of the deepest
in the United States.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: John, what is Nellis
Air Force Base, as far as being

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.850 align:middle line:90%
involved with all this?

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Well, I can tell you
that Nellis Air Force Base will

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.670 align:middle line:84%
be the last Air
Force facility that

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:90%
will ever be decommissioned.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.980 align:middle line:84%
But there is so much
going on at Nellis

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.090 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know about.

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:40.050 align:middle line:84%
One thing is for
years part of Nellis

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.390 align:middle line:84%
was the Lake Mead
Naval Air Station.

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It seems like a joint
effort actually of many Air

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.060 align:middle line:90%
Force, Marines, Navy.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:90%
They're all there.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: But the Navy wanted
to dissociate themselves

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.477 align:middle line:84%
with Nellis because of the
submarine access to Nellis.

00:20:57.477 --> 00:20:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That makes sense.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: So they got rid of
that Lake Mead Naval Air

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Station to disassociate
themselves with Nellis.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.090 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
Navy activity there.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mhm.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I've been to
Nellis, as you know.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:15.210 align:middle line:84%
But I was not there
under classified orders.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:20.040 align:middle line:84%
I was just picking some things
up to get back to Kirkland.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And I did meet with
some people there.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And there is a large
facility below Nellis.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Massive.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That stretches miles
and miles, they told me.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Right.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:36.540 align:middle line:90%
And highways up to Groom Lake.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.710 align:middle line:84%
But in addition to these
massive facilities underground,

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:41.920 align:middle line:90%
they have massive facilities.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.300 align:middle line:84%
This mountain range behind here
is called Friendship Mountain.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.710 align:middle line:90%
That's full of labs.

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.530 align:middle line:84%
I was telling my team
that on the way up.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:51.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: There was a
secret runway at Nellis

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.750 align:middle line:84%
that they use only
once in a while.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason I
know is I had guys that

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:00.150 align:middle line:90%
worked out on the flight line.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And they said that
occasionally they

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.150 align:middle line:84%
would uncover this
secret runway,

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.070 align:middle line:84%
because it was shorter
than a normal runway.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing
tactical exercises

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.410 align:middle line:84%
with the F-16 and the
the F-15 that they

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.810 align:middle line:84%
had to land on these
shorter runways.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:17.340 align:middle line:90%
And the one guy said--

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.720 align:middle line:90%
I said, what was the name?

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.890 align:middle line:84%
He said, all I heard was we're
going out to flight line.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:25.362 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what
the real name of it is.

00:22:25.362 --> 00:22:26.820 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
Google pictures,

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.490 align:middle line:84%
I can see about where
it is, but absolutely

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.900 align:middle line:90%
no trace that it's there.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And also, I had a friend that
worked for a large paving

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:39.455 align:middle line:84%
company in Las Vegas
that paved the taxiways.

00:22:39.455 --> 00:22:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, that's a special
contractor right there.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Right.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yep.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Could you explain to me
the D DOT D material?

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And how it's made, where it's
made, and besides the subs,

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:58.950 align:middle line:84%
are they using it in any other
aerospace technology or weapon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.880 align:middle line:90%
technology?

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: Emery, I got my
information from a Navy guy.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.290 align:middle line:90%
They told me about it.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.980 align:middle line:84%
He said it had to
be made in zero G.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.897 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you mean
in space, in orbit?

00:23:13.897 --> 00:23:14.730 align:middle line:90%
And they said, yeah.

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:17.450 align:middle line:90%
They have foundaries that orbit.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And that fit in what we
know about the US Navy Space

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.140 align:middle line:90%
Command.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:27.690 align:middle line:84%
They have many, many things in
orbit, including direct energy

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.960 align:middle line:84%
weapons and foundaries,
and command centers

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.500 align:middle line:84%
of all type, all of it launched
out of Kwajalein Island.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And what it does, it's lighter
than titanium, and stronger.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And with a small
electrical charge,

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:45.150 align:middle line:84%
it keeps the water five to seven
centimeters away from the hull.

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So any hull based craft,
we know that the equation

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:53.070 align:middle line:84%
is 1.34 times the square
root of the waterline, which

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:84%
limits any craft, aircraft
carrier to submarines,

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:58.110 align:middle line:90%
to about 45 knots.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:02.040 align:middle line:84%
But now with this new D DOT D
they've had for about 10 years,

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.310 align:middle line:84%
with no drag, they
can go over 100 knots.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:09.570 align:middle line:10%
And you talk about the Gerald
Ford recently launched,

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.698 align:middle line:10%
a massive aircraft
carrier doing 100 knots.

00:24:11.698 --> 00:24:12.740 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Incredibly fast.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:13.400 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.190 align:middle line:10%
>>LEAR: Doing 100 knots.

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:14.880 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.922 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's incredible.

00:24:15.922 --> 00:24:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And the
question comes up, well,

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.380 align:middle line:90%
don't the sailors know that?

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, the
sailors are kept below decks

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:25.320 align:middle line:90%
while they're transporting.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And when they get to
somewhere 10 times

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.032 align:middle line:84%
faster than they normally
would, a sailor's

00:24:30.032 --> 00:24:31.740 align:middle line:84%
not going to go to
his commanding officer

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.850 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, what's
going on here?

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.610 align:middle line:84%
How come we're here
six times faster?

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:40.477 align:middle line:84%
That would be the way to
get eliminated real easy.

00:24:40.477 --> 00:24:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Terminated.

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:42.230 align:middle line:90%
Court martialled.

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:43.470 align:middle line:90%
Done.

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: The same thing with the
submarine that shot down TWA

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:48.865 align:middle line:90%
Flight--

00:24:48.865 --> 00:24:49.740 align:middle line:90%
I forget what it was.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.530 align:middle line:84%
811 or what it was
over Long Island.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:56.640 align:middle line:84%
What they were doing
was tracking a drone.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
the tracking system

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:84%
lost the track for
like a millisecond.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And when it reacquired the
track, it reacquired the 747

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.070 align:middle line:90%
and blew it out of the sky.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was no
explosive on it.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.060 align:middle line:84%
But it went through the top
of the 747 and split it.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And all the witnesses said,
no, we saw something coming up.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:19.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:20.300 align:middle line:90%
Coming up.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.758 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And they
said, no, you just

00:25:21.758 --> 00:25:23.130 align:middle line:90%
saw this stuff coming down.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.700 align:middle line:84%
They had the SEAL teams
on site in 30 minutes

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.410 align:middle line:84%
to get everything possible
that could have connected

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:33.380 align:middle line:90%
the Navy with that incident.

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And what they
did with everybody

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:39.070 align:middle line:84%
that was on that submarine,
they knew they shot it down.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:42.250 align:middle line:84%
They transferred every
single one of the 140 people

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.630 align:middle line:84%
all to different
stations so they

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.040 align:middle line:90%
couldn't talk among themselves.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.457 align:middle line:84%
So they know how
to keep a secret.

00:25:47.457 --> 00:25:48.257 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:25:48.257 --> 00:25:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: And it
doesn't depend on--

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.670 align:middle line:84%
a Navy person is not
going to come out

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, you'll
never believe

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.550 align:middle line:90%
what I saw the other day.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:56.632 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:25:56.632 --> 00:25:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: John, do
you think there's

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:04.420 align:middle line:84%
a way through your father's
anti-gravitic inventions

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:08.767 align:middle line:84%
and engineering that this could
be applied to a submarine?

00:26:08.767 --> 00:26:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: It probably could.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:11.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the exact
one that they used.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.460 align:middle line:84%
But like I say, there's
been many different kinds

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.520 align:middle line:84%
of anti-grav that
have been developed.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.870 align:middle line:84%
One 15 years ago I know
had to do with mercury.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll
remember 15 years ago

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.150 align:middle line:84%
they banned all
mercury thermometers

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:29.860 align:middle line:90%
for saying it was too dangerous.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:30.910 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't dangerous.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:32.030 align:middle line:90%
They needed the mercury.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't want it
used up with thermometers.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:39.700 align:middle line:84%
So they had something at
that time that used mercury.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they've developed
can be used for both airplanes

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.240 align:middle line:90%
and ships, boats, submarines.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.140 align:middle line:84%
If the D DOT D can keep the
water five to seven centimeters

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:54.440 align:middle line:84%
away from the hull
and reduce the drag,

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.980 align:middle line:84%
then certainly the
same technology

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:58.540 align:middle line:90%
could be used for airplanes.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, we definitely, at least
when Bob Lazar worked at S-4,

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.620 align:middle line:90%
had mock 12 vehicles.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.810 align:middle line:84%
You'll hear that the
Aurora, they never made it.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:10.090 align:middle line:90%
It was just a budget program.

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Bunch of BS.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: They really
did have Aurora.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And it did fly at mock
12 at 250,000 feet.

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:21.145 align:middle line:84%
He saw one of them
on the ramp there.

00:27:21.145 --> 00:27:22.270 align:middle line:90%
And everybody said, no, no.

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:23.228 align:middle line:90%
That's not what it was.

00:27:23.228 --> 00:27:24.340 align:middle line:90%
But it was real.

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And there have been several
advances more in technology.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:31.040 align:middle line:90%
I hear that we go mock 30 now.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Some of the saucers that
I've seen that we reproduced,

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:39.950 align:middle line:84%
they can go in the
water like submarines.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:40.990 align:middle line:90%
They can go anywhere.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Exactly.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And I
wouldn't be surprised

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:49.570 align:middle line:84%
if submarines do have some sort
of anti-gravitic capabilities

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:51.860 align:middle line:90%
for emergency situations.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:54.430 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's
a way to do it.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:28:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Do these underwater tunnels
go as far north as Canada

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:04.360 align:middle line:84%
with the Pacific
Ocean, as we'll say,

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:07.720 align:middle line:84%
how it's floating the
continent on this?

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.727 align:middle line:84%
>>LEAR: You know, people
talk about tunnels.

00:28:09.727 --> 00:28:10.560 align:middle line:90%
They're not tunnels.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: It's an ocean.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:13.168 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's an
ocean, full ocean.

00:28:13.168 --> 00:28:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: And yes.

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:16.870 align:middle line:90%
Canada, United States.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:17.810 align:middle line:90%
It's not limited.

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:19.990 align:middle line:84%
The ocean goes
under all of that.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.620 align:middle line:90%
It just depends on how far.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.670 align:middle line:84%
For all I know, the entire
North American plate

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:27.550 align:middle line:84%
could be floating on
the Pacific Ocean.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: John, thanks again.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:32.080 align:middle line:84%
This was an amazing
instruction, again,

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.950 align:middle line:90%
on these underwater facilities.

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Cause it's not
talked about, ever.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Right.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And I think it'll be
a big eye opener for everyone.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Right.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So thanks
for being on the show.

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LEAR: Thank you, Emery.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.980 align:middle line:90%
