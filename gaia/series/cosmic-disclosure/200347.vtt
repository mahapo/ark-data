00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are talking about

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.370 align:middle line:10%
extraterrestrial and SSP
craft with Randy Cramer.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.370 align:middle line:84%
So in your services off
planet, you were exposed to

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and worked on
technology and SSP craft

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.470 align:middle line:84%
unlike any of the conventional
technologies and craft

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us about that, such
as the fighters and shuttles,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:90%
carriers?

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:10%
So there are a number of craft
that are used across the fleet.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:10%
As I have said before
about a number of things,

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.610 align:middle line:10%
we're still experimenting
with what works best.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.310 align:middle line:84%
We're still tinkering
with designs

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.570 align:middle line:84%
to perfect these craft
to the best of what

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle line:84%
we want them to be to
function at the highest level

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.420 align:middle line:90%
that we want them to function.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.170 align:middle line:84%
So probably the typical
variations in a fighter

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.400 align:middle line:84%
are whether it's a one-seater
or two-seater or a three-seater,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.890 align:middle line:84%
which will depend on whether you
have a pilot and gunner, which

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.810 align:middle line:90%
runs the weapons systems.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you have a pilot and
two weapons systems operators,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.730 align:middle line:84%
which let's just
say that that gives

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.530 align:middle line:84%
the vehicle a lot
of options to shoot

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.988 align:middle line:84%
at a lot of different
targets, when

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:84%
you have two people aiming
weapons at vehicles around you

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and the pilot doing
the maneuvering.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a tricky dance,
but it can work.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:90%
It can be very effective.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So not much bigger than
your standard fighter jet,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:84%
necessarily, as far as
height, length, width.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.600 align:middle line:84%
They're probably more narrow
than that because they don't

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.660 align:middle line:84%
have a wingspan,
and a little shorter

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.090 align:middle line:84%
because you don't necessarily
have the tail section.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.820 align:middle line:84%
But they're kind of comparable
to height and length and width.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you describe them,
what they actually look like ?

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:84%
The fighter that
I flew in the most

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.770 align:middle line:84%
was called a Viper Class, which
essentially looks like a cone.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.960 align:middle line:84%
So you have a kind
of a flat in here,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:84%
and then it tapers to
a point near the front.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.680 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a flat bottom
where the propulsion system is

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.230 align:middle line:84%
with the cockpit pretty high,
all of the tech in the middle

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.520 align:middle line:90%
here somewhere.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually--
in the back of the craft,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.370 align:middle line:84%
there's a bathroom,
there's a cot,

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.300 align:middle line:84%
there's emergency food
supplies, emergency blankets.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's not much bigger than a
sleeping unit in a semi truck,

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.020 align:middle line:84%
if you know anyone
who ever knows someone

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:84%
who drives a truck, and there's
a little sleeping chamber

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.340 align:middle line:84%
in the back, It's not
very big, so we're not

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.930 align:middle line:90%
talking a very big space.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.200 align:middle line:84%
But in case of
emergencies and you're

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.870 align:middle line:84%
stuck somewhere for
a long time, or you

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.270 align:middle line:84%
don't have full operation
of the heating system

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.990 align:middle line:84%
so that you need extra blankets
for the coldness of space,

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.640 align:middle line:84%
which isn't necessarily as
uniformly cold as some people

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.200 align:middle line:90%
think it is, for starters.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.612 align:middle line:84%
>> So these are the Vipers
and the Viper Class, right?

00:03:14.612 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Viper Class Fighter, yeah.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And this Viper
Class Fighter comes--

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.570 align:middle line:90%
how many is in one fleet?

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>> We had a single carrier
which had, let's see,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.580 align:middle line:84%
I want to say 12
squadrons of 16,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.560 align:middle line:84%
so whatever that
math works out to be,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.760 align:middle line:84%
which is over 100
fighters per vessel.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And I can't say how
many of those carriers

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:84%
that we have, but we
have enough of them

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.860 align:middle line:84%
that we could deploy hundreds
of fighters to a situation

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.970 align:middle line:90%
that was required.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the propulsion
unit on these fighters?

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's a combination
electrogravitic,

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.090 align:middle line:90%
magnetogravitic system.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So the electrogravitic
system pumps

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.860 align:middle line:84%
high-frequency electricity
into the fuselage,

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.160 align:middle line:84%
making it weigh less, which
makes it more maneuverable,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:84%
takes less forced to move
it, stop it, et cetera.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
magnetogravitic propulsion

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.920 align:middle line:84%
system underneath,
which is essentially

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.750 align:middle line:84%
what creates the field
that it moves on.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So the way I like
to describe that is

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.870 align:middle line:84%
the toroidal field from the
magnetogravitic propulsion

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.760 align:middle line:84%
system creates a
little pool sort

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.790 align:middle line:84%
of underneath the vehicle of
this magnetogravitic waves.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.060 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like a puddle.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.300 align:middle line:84%
If you think of it like
a puddle of water that

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.570 align:middle line:84%
is created under the vehicle,
then when the vehicle leans

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.610 align:middle line:84%
left, right, front,
backwards, it

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.490 align:middle line:84%
slides on that what we call
a slipstream like a Slip 'N

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.290 align:middle line:90%
Slide.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So the propulsion system is
basically creating this field

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.640 align:middle line:84%
that then it slides back, forth,
left, or right, and so forth on

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.890 align:middle line:84%
at incredible speeds,
especially when you're

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.340 align:middle line:84%
talking about making the
fuselage weigh less, which--

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>> About how fast?

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, top speed
in open space?

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Over 80,000 miles an hour.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>> And on Earth what would it--

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>> In an atmosphere, like,
20,000, 25,000 miles an hour,

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:90%
about, tops.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And it has its own field
around it so it can make these

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.935 align:middle line:84%
right-hand turns, and you
wouldn't feel anything inside

00:05:17.935 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:84%
it because you're in your
own gravitational field?

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.980 align:middle line:84%
So the larger
magnetogravitic field

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.170 align:middle line:84%
that surrounds
the entire vehicle

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.750 align:middle line:84%
is an inertial damper
in and of itself.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.150 align:middle line:84%
It's an inertial damping
field so that there

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:38.210 align:middle line:84%
is no physics acted upon objects
within the field as the same

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.310 align:middle line:84%
as if they were acted
upon outside the field.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.890 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that's how you can make
90-degree turns or rapid slides

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.730 align:middle line:84%
up, down, left, right without
smashing into the front

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.550 align:middle line:90%
of the back of the vehicle.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, these vehicles
are designed to feel

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.100 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of the movement.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.410 align:middle line:84%
So there are vehicles that
create this field where

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.490 align:middle line:90%
you don't feel anything.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.260 align:middle line:84%
You don't feel left,
you don't feel right.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.150 align:middle line:84%
But what they found
out was pilots

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:90%
need to feel the vehicle.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.220 align:middle line:84%
So a pilot who doesn't
feel that inertia at all

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.840 align:middle line:84%
can't feel what
they're doing, can't

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.580 align:middle line:90%
feel what the ship is doing.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.915 align:middle line:84%
So a pilot needs to
have some sense of,

00:06:16.915 --> 00:06:19.040 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm pulling the left,
I'm pulling to the right,

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm accelerating, I'm stopping.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very minimal
feeling but it's just enough

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.240 align:middle line:84%
so that your body
feels interactive

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.180 align:middle line:90%
to the process of piloting.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Randy, do we have any
vehicles currently that have

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.500 align:middle line:84%
FTL, Faster Than
Light, capabilities?

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>> We certainly are working on
some experimental vehicles that

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.610 align:middle line:84%
do do that, not fighter
craft-size craft,

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.750 align:middle line:90%
not small craft shuttles.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Some of the larger vehicles,
they've been working on that.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:50.130 align:middle line:84%
But jump gates really make that
negligible because you don't

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.950 align:middle line:84%
need to go faster than
light over a long distance

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:57.000 align:middle line:84%
when you can just shrink the
distance from here to here

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:90%
and then jump through it.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of those things
that we can keep chasing it,

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.040 align:middle line:84%
but we really have technology
that already supersedes that,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.730 align:middle line:90%
so why bother?

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And what are you
utilizing the shuttles for?

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Same thing that you would use
any shuttle for, when you need

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.960 align:middle line:84%
to move a small group of
people or cargo from one place

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.390 align:middle line:84%
to another that's a short
distance, use a shuttle craft.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, why not just use the
troop transports or these giant

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.210 align:middle line:84%
destroyers you
were talking about?

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if they're
transporting a lot of things,

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:84%
there are freighters that carry
a lot of material in them.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.790 align:middle line:90%
The larger ships certainly--

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>> What's the scope of these--

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:84%
what's the size of
these giant destroyers?

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So like I said, a carrier
is about a mile long.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.750 align:middle line:84%
The destroyers can be
3/4, about a mile long.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.330 align:middle line:84%
The frigates tend to be
about half that size.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And where are these
deep space vehicles?

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.180 align:middle line:84%
There are some
deep space vehicles

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:84%
that we called juggernauts,
and the juggernauts

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.720 align:middle line:84%
are designed where,
unlike some of the craft

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.270 align:middle line:84%
we have now where you
have a forward operating

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:07.520 align:middle line:84%
bridge or a high-placed bridge
on the vehicles for optics

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.670 align:middle line:84%
so that you can see
things, the bridge

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.780 align:middle line:84%
is in the middle of
the ship because that's

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.790 align:middle line:84%
the most protected
place for it to be.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, everything
is designed so

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.570 align:middle line:84%
that the core operation of
the vehicle is in the center,

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and you have all these
layers of compartments

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.850 align:middle line:90%
and fuselage so that it can--

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.570 align:middle line:84%
really, not unlike Naval
ships that float on the sea

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.570 align:middle line:84%
are designed, so they
can take a pummeling.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can damage the exterior
and put holes in the exterior,

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and it will still
function and go

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.909 align:middle line:84%
because that's just
essentially an outer layer,

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.540 align:middle line:84%
where all the really important
stuff is in the center.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Do these craft have any
type of escape pods in case

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.960 align:middle line:90%
something goes wrong?

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Most of them are shuttles.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.980 align:middle line:84%
If they have enough shuttles
or fighters to get everybody

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:84%
off the vehicle, but the
sort of escape pod idea

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.580 align:middle line:84%
turns out to not
be very practical

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.000 align:middle line:90%
because pods don't go very far.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.590 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a combat situation,
you're easy target practice.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.605 align:middle line:84%
Someone can just
pop escape pods.

00:09:10.605 --> 00:09:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So you really need to
get into a vehicle that

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.777 align:middle line:84%
can move quickly away
from the damaged vehicle

00:09:14.777 --> 00:09:16.110 align:middle line:90%
if you're in a combat situation.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>> You're just sitting
ducks out there in pods.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:84%
This reminds me of the old days
of jumping out of airplanes.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you already have the
enemy there on the ground,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.510 align:middle line:90%
it's just a matter of numbers.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.635 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a reason why
paratroopers jump at night,

00:09:28.635 --> 00:09:30.660 align:middle line:84%
because during the daytime
you're an easy target

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.720 align:middle line:90%
in the sky, yeah.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>> And what do they have?

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.210 align:middle line:90%
What do the ETs have?

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.540 align:middle line:84%
What kind of craft
do they utilize

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.220 align:middle line:90%
that's comparable to ours?

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So most ET craft tend to fall
into categories of scout ships

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.780 align:middle line:90%
or mother ships.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.730 align:middle line:84%
There aren't too
many species that

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:84%
have specific fighter
craft in the way

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:90%
that we design fighters.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
They tend to use their
scout ships as multi-use.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.850 align:middle line:84%
So a scout ship is a
quick maneuverable vehicle

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:84%
that may have some
weapon technology on it.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:06.000 align:middle line:84%
But other than
the Draconians, we

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.560 align:middle line:84%
haven't really
encountered a species

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.380 align:middle line:84%
that is as dedicated to their
military hardware as we are.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.400 align:middle line:84%
So we don't tend to find
too many other fighter craft

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.020 align:middle line:90%
in the way that we design them.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.453 align:middle line:84%
>> What do the Draconians have
that's such amazing compared

00:10:19.453 --> 00:10:20.370 align:middle line:90%
to our fighting craft?

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I wouldn't say
it's so amazing so much

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:middle line:84%
as, in a similar way that we
like to have a variety of tools

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.320 align:middle line:84%
for specific purposes, they
also have a variety of tactical

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.180 align:middle line:84%
weapons and tools for
specific purposes.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So their aircraft are
a little more varied.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And what is this
Dyson sphere vessels?

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, those are probably
the most amazing things ever.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.550 align:middle line:84%
So a Dyson sphere is
a engineered sphere

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.530 align:middle line:90%
around a star.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So basically, think
about if you created

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.710 align:middle line:84%
a metal ball, a hollow
metal ball, with a star

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.650 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
that metal ball,

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:03.510 align:middle line:84%
then the ship, once it's
fully operational and powered,

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:07.090 align:middle line:84%
holds the star in
a magnetic field

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:10.770 align:middle line:84%
so that essentially the
propulsion is moving the star,

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.390 align:middle line:90%
which then moves the vehicle.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a
ship that can literally

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:84%
house billions or
trillions of people,

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.650 align:middle line:84%
keeping in mind there's an
interior to the ship that

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:29.910 align:middle line:84%
can be grass, trees,
rivers, streams because it

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.010 align:middle line:90%
has a sun for a power source.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:36.073 align:middle line:84%
You can essentially have
an entire planet inverted,

00:11:36.073 --> 00:11:38.490 align:middle line:84%
basically, so instead of being
on the outside of the ball,

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:84%
it's on the inside of the ball
with the star in the middle.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And the star also is
able to be focused

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.920 align:middle line:84%
through a series of
magnifies into a weapon,

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.430 align:middle line:84%
to a singular weapon, the most
destructive weapon we have ever

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.700 align:middle line:84%
heard of so far, which
basically turns a star

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:90%
into a concentrated beam.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you seen
this actually happen?

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I haven't been there
to see one happen.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.340 align:middle line:84%
I've seen records that
we have of these ships

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.270 align:middle line:90%
and how they operate.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.910 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty wild.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.680 align:middle line:84%
One of these ships
could incinerate

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.320 align:middle line:84%
an entire planet
or an entire star

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.500 align:middle line:90%
in one shot, a few seconds.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds like a deep
responsibility for this type

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.340 align:middle line:90%
of race to have this.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The only species that we know
that make ships like this are

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:29.510 align:middle line:84%
incredibly long lived because
the species that I'm thinking

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
of in particular has a lifespan
where each individual organism

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:37.040 align:middle line:84%
of their species lives
millions of years,

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.340 align:middle line:84%
and it takes about 180,000 years
to build one of these ships.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.400 align:middle line:84%
So it takes an incredible
amount of long-term planning.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, certainly, there's
some responsibility involved.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.110 align:middle line:84%
But think about
it this way, too.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Instead of having
a fleet that has

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.540 align:middle line:84%
to go away from your
planet, you just

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.120 align:middle line:84%
make a ship that's bigger
than your planet, that

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.095 align:middle line:84%
can house more people
than your planet,

00:12:58.095 --> 00:12:59.720 align:middle line:84%
and then that becomes
the ship that you

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.190 align:middle line:84%
can travel through space forever
and ever and ever because you

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.310 align:middle line:84%
have a self-contained ship
that's bigger and more

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.060 align:middle line:90%
self-contained than a planet.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>> That's amazing.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>> They are amazing.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.210 align:middle line:90%
They are amazing.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So Randy, some of these craft
are bigger on the inside than

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.590 align:middle line:90%
they are on the outside.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain to us
how that's possible?

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:26.490 align:middle line:84%
So once a species
comes to understand

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:31.320 align:middle line:84%
the technology and the
physics around dimensions,

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.450 align:middle line:84%
it becomes possible
to create something

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.350 align:middle line:84%
called pocket dimension,
which is essentially--

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:84%
if my hands together represent
a piece of closed space

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.770 align:middle line:84%
where there is no
gap between them,

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.810 align:middle line:84%
you're basically
able to say, I'm

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.300 align:middle line:84%
going to create space in
the middle of something

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.045 align:middle line:90%
where previously there was none.

00:13:50.045 --> 00:13:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And then you're able to
make that larger and larger

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.150 align:middle line:84%
and larger so that
effectively you

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:58.800 align:middle line:84%
have more square footage on
the inside the outside would

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.280 align:middle line:90%
indicate that are possible.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.000 align:middle line:84%
So again, a ship that would
look like it might only

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.180 align:middle line:84%
have been able to have
dozens of personnel aboard it

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:90%
may have thousands.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>> That makes total sense to me
because in physics we all know

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.090 align:middle line:90%
we're 99.9% space everywhere.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, from having been
exposed to all these ET craft

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and technologies, has it changed
or affected you in any way

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.700 align:middle line:90%
in your life?

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe just in a way that
I think of as bigger universe

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:28.780 align:middle line:90%
in a bigger way.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Every time I learn
something or see something,

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:36.500 align:middle line:84%
it rewrites the way that my
brain sees the big picture.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.890 align:middle line:84%
So having seen all
of those things

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.980 align:middle line:84%
makes for a really interesting
big picture inside my head.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And I find it very
helpful to understand

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.260 align:middle line:84%
all of those components, to be
able to understand the bigger

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.178 align:middle line:84%
picture, which is we're
really good at what we do.

00:14:50.178 --> 00:14:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't been
doing it for very long,

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.083 align:middle line:90%
and that's something to be said.

00:14:54.083 --> 00:14:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And there always are
going to be species

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:58.660 align:middle line:84%
who are better at certain
things than we are,

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and there's always going to be
species who are worse at things

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:02.190 align:middle line:90%
than we are.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:07.750 align:middle line:84%
So there is a constant of
every species in the universe

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.750 align:middle line:84%
that we know of
exists on a ladder,

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.310 align:middle line:84%
somewhere on a rung
on that ladder.

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's always
more rungs above,

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:16.200 align:middle line:84%
and there's always
more rungs below.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And as near as we
understand, there

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.600 align:middle line:84%
is no top of that ladder in
which there is no place farther

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.440 align:middle line:90%
to go that we are aware of.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So it encourages
me that there is

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.780 align:middle line:84%
plenty of growth,
plenty of opportunity

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:36.460 align:middle line:84%
to advance and evolve ourselves
way beyond anything we can even

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.570 align:middle line:90%
comprehend at the moment.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking
forward to the future.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And compared to humans, would
you say that most ET beings,

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:84%
on a sliding scale, are
benevolent or more hostile

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:90%
after what you have encountered?

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So statistically, we find
that about 95% of the species

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.390 align:middle line:84%
that we run into, their main
thing that they would like

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.830 align:middle line:90%
to do is trade.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:01.503 align:middle line:84%
So we say that there's sort
of 95% that are cooperative.

00:16:01.503 --> 00:16:03.670 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that
they're necessarily friendly.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.837 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that they're
not aggressive, doesn't

00:16:05.837 --> 00:16:07.750 align:middle line:84%
mean that they're
not violent at times.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:11.770 align:middle line:84%
It means that they have
learned, as we are learning,

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.270 align:middle line:84%
you get more flies with honey
than you do with vinegar.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And so if you want to
trade, you don't go around

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.700 align:middle line:90%
punching people in the eyeball.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.500 align:middle line:84%
You kind of have to play
nice most of the time.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.380 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't mean that
it doesn't preclude

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.040 align:middle line:84%
that an entire species can't be
aggressive, can't be violent,

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:27.880 align:middle line:90%
isn't warlike.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.800 align:middle line:84%
It just means that
they understand

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.190 align:middle line:84%
that trading is a priority,
and you would rather

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.142 align:middle line:84%
sit down and have a
conversation about trade

00:16:35.142 --> 00:16:36.850 align:middle line:84%
than just start poking
people in the eye.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:40.180 align:middle line:84%
You have about a 5% of
who we run into out there

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:45.095 align:middle line:84%
in the universe who are
uncooperative or difficult,

00:16:45.095 --> 00:16:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and that doesn't mean that
they don't want to play along,

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.762 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to play nice,
they don't want to trade.

00:16:49.762 --> 00:16:52.930 align:middle line:84%
They'd rather steal things,
take things, or be dishonest.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:84%
But that's about
a 95% to 5% ratio.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And where do we
fall in that category?

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>> At the moment
we're in that 95%,

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.740 align:middle line:84%
where we would prefer to
trade more than anything else

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.290 align:middle line:84%
because we understand the
value of trade is greater than

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.819 align:middle line:90%
conquest.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:12.010 align:middle line:84%
We can simply make more
money as a species in trade

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.869 align:middle line:84%
than we could in
imperial conquest.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:16.900 align:middle line:84%
If we just decided we wanted
to try and take over planets

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.260 align:middle line:84%
and consume all of their
resources or take them over,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.700 align:middle line:84%
it's an incredibly
costly process.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And you don't necessarily
benefit a lot of that.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the profit
motive works better when

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:90%
you have supply and demand.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:34.000 align:middle line:84%
So at the moment, we're in that
95% that we're cooperative.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But it also turns out that we're
in a smaller percentage who

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.360 align:middle line:84%
is capable of
militarily defending

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.770 align:middle line:90%
themselves or attacking others.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:48.445 align:middle line:84%
So we're very quickly becoming
a respected muscle on the block,

00:17:48.445 --> 00:17:49.640 align:middle line:90%
if that were.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:84%
But there's always
someone bigger,

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.860 align:middle line:84%
but there's always
someone smaller.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And where are some of our
closest allies and star friends

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.670 align:middle line:84%
and neighbors that
you're aware of?

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, all over the
place, certainly.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.082 align:middle line:84%
But Alpha Centauri, the
Centauri are probably

00:18:06.082 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:84%
our closest friends
because they're

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:10.630 align:middle line:90%
only 4 light years away.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:13.220 align:middle line:84%
We've been trading with
them for a few decades.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the
Pleiadians and Lyra,

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:16.930 align:middle line:90%
like we know in pop culture?

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:21.770 align:middle line:84%
People are talking about
Sirius and Arcturus.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And I know these
are huge star systems.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.500 align:middle line:90%
I want to make note of that.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.640 align:middle line:84%
There's thousands and
thousands of planets there.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.240 align:middle line:90%
It's not just one system.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.060 align:middle line:84%
I always find it funny when
someone comes to me and says,

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.410 align:middle line:90%
well, I'm from Arcturan.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, well,
that's a pretty big spot.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.270 align:middle line:84%
That's like saying,
well, I'm from Earth.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:90%
But where on Earth?

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of places
you could be from.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.910 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:49.990 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadian system is
seven stars and about 20

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:90%
civilized worlds with--

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.390 align:middle line:90%


00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.630 align:middle line:84%
there's at least 20 or
more advanced civilization

00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:59.978 align:middle line:90%
within the Pleiadian system.

00:18:59.978 --> 00:19:02.020 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I kind of laugh,
too, when someone says,

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:02.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm Pleiadian.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.690 align:middle line:90%
I want to say, which one?

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:06.400 align:middle line:90%
Be more specific about that's.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not specific at all.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.600 align:middle line:90%
It's very general.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And I want to point out that
very recently, at a conference

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.470 align:middle line:84%
that I was at in Toronto,
Paula Harris was there,

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:16.330 align:middle line:90%
and she actually made a comment.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.940 align:middle line:84%
She said, look, based on the
evidence and the eyewitness

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.770 align:middle line:84%
testimony we're talking
about right now,

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.530 align:middle line:84%
we have confirmed dealings
with dozens of species.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Why are we still talking
about these same old three

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:30.650 align:middle line:84%
that we've been talking about
forever when there's more?

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:31.900 align:middle line:90%
That's a disservice to people.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an unlimited amount.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.570 align:middle line:90%
It really is, out there.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm glad you brought
that up because I

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:84%
think we should probably
get into them at some point

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.790 align:middle line:90%
to educate people about that.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And by doing something
like maybe getting

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:50.650 align:middle line:84%
an observatory locked on and
educating more people out there

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:53.770 align:middle line:84%
about how vast the
space is, I think

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.708 align:middle line:84%
we'll change the way
people look at it.

00:19:56.708 --> 00:19:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, that's what we hope.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:84%
We hope that by continuing
to add this information

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.050 align:middle line:84%
into the public
discussion sphere,

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:84%
that it will give
people the ability

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.130 align:middle line:84%
to think about
the bigger picture

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:09.370 align:middle line:84%
and contemplate a bigger
universe that they fit into,

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:13.030 align:middle line:84%
which is important for people
to think of possibilities

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and narratives in which they
belong in a larger universe,

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:19.480 align:middle line:84%
instead of thinking of
selves as being isolated

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.520 align:middle line:84%
and not part of
that, or thinking

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.340 align:middle line:84%
of that outside universe is just
something to be terrified of

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:25.840 align:middle line:90%
or something to be afraid of.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Another thing is something
that's four light years away

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:33.760 align:middle line:84%
or 100 light years away, it's
really not utilizing a straight

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.020 align:middle line:90%
line of sight to get there.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.940 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of immediately.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:40.210 align:middle line:84%
We've had a lot of guests
come on "Cosmic Disclosure"

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:45.040 align:middle line:84%
talking about how they
consciously were traveling

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.640 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials,
and someone would say,

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.180 align:middle line:84%
well, they would put their
hand on the wall of the craft,

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and in a matter of seconds,
they would not be on Earth.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:84%
They'd be in another
solar system.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.500 align:middle line:84%
So what are they
utilizing there for that?

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Predominantly, they're using
some form of wormhole jumpgate

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.540 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you have to
travel across vast distances.

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you're traveling
across vast distances,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.610 align:middle line:84%
even with faster than light,
can take a very, very long time.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:18.850 align:middle line:84%
You definitely have to
be getting into warp

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.210 align:middle line:84%
travel to make traveling in
a straight line across space

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:23.570 align:middle line:90%
even remotely worth it.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.460 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out, again,
that wormhole technology,

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.810 align:middle line:90%
you get faster.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Most species will get
the wormhole technology

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.660 align:middle line:84%
before they get work field
technology because it's easier.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:38.340 align:middle line:84%
So once you get
that technology, why

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.840 align:middle line:84%
would you bother
with anything else?

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.798 align:middle line:90%
Let me put it this way.

00:21:40.798 --> 00:21:43.700 align:middle line:84%
If you had a watch that you
could wear on your wrist that

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.855 align:middle line:84%
would make a wormhole that you
could go to anywhere on planet

00:21:46.855 --> 00:21:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Earth, why would you ever
ride a bus, ride a train,

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.150 align:middle line:84%
or fly a plane or
drive a car ever again?

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Another interesting thing that I
have had a little experience in

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.790 align:middle line:84%
is some of these
craft are actually

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:02.690 align:middle line:84%
linked to the pilot of
that craft on a more

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:03.650 align:middle line:90%
conscious level.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:04.640 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain that?

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.300 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the, especially
extraterrestrial, ships

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:12.990 align:middle line:84%
from more advanced civilizations
have a navigation system,

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:16.970 align:middle line:84%
which is essentially the
pilot connecting directly

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:19.310 align:middle line:84%
into the system, the
computer systems,

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:23.160 align:middle line:84%
so that the pilot feels
like the ship is their body.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And so you're moving the ship as
if you would move your own body

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.990 align:middle line:84%
because it feels like
that's what you're doing,

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.920 align:middle line:84%
but you're just directing it
mentally through the navigation

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.387 align:middle line:84%
system that's essentially a
telepathic psionic system.

00:22:37.387 --> 00:22:38.720 align:middle line:90%
Now, there are, I've been told--

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.170 align:middle line:84%
I've never experienced
one myself.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:44.730 align:middle line:84%
But I've been told there are
ships that are a combination

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:50.480 align:middle line:84%
organic, mechanical
that are alive and have

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:84%
some personality to them
and get bonded to a person,

00:22:55.430 --> 00:23:00.950 align:middle line:84%
to a pilot like a dog
or a cat or a horse

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:02.270 align:middle line:90%
becomes bonded to that person.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.030 align:middle line:84%
In those cases,
sometimes that ship

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.190 align:middle line:84%
simply won't fly if
it's not the pilot

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:08.315 align:middle line:90%
that it's familiar with it.

00:23:08.315 --> 00:23:10.482 align:middle line:84%
If you sit down in the
chair, it's just going to go,

00:23:10.482 --> 00:23:11.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't know you.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.350 align:middle line:84%
What are you sitting
down here for?

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm not flying for you.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>> No, absolutely.

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:15.470 align:middle line:84%
There was many times
in the projects

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.840 align:middle line:84%
where we had to be
inoculated with the DNA

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:21.320 align:middle line:84%
from a being in order
to access the craft.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.363 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, that's a clever
way around that.

00:23:23.363 --> 00:23:24.530 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't thought about that.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And it doesn't last
forever, but at least the craft

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:33.650 align:middle line:84%
doesn't catch on for
a while, I guess.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Through your
adventures, traveling

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.510 align:middle line:84%
through space and
maybe even time,

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:43.730 align:middle line:84%
have you felt anything that
changed your consciousness

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:46.160 align:middle line:90%
during these events?

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.678 align:middle line:84%
Actually, that's an
interesting question.

00:23:48.678 --> 00:23:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So the first time that
I was in a fighter

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and got hit with an
electromagnetic pulse,

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:57.920 align:middle line:84%
chip goes dead, just starts
kind of floating and spinning

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.940 align:middle line:90%
in space.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:02.870 align:middle line:84%
But what I found was when
everything turns off,

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:05.600 align:middle line:84%
all the electronics are off,
all these fields are shut down,

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.270 align:middle line:84%
the forcefield's shut down,
the magnetogravitic field's

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:13.250 align:middle line:84%
shut down, there is nothing
between you and space.

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:17.660 align:middle line:90%
And space makes music.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that the music space

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:27.660 align:middle line:84%
makes depends on what point
in space you're focusing on.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:32.610 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, if I was
floating out in space-- which

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:35.290 align:middle line:84%
you can see everything when
you're floating out in space.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not like this dark,
black, where is everything?

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.570 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
constellations, you

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.460 align:middle line:84%
see the northern stars,
the southern stars.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.440 align:middle line:84%
The galaxy is this ring
that goes around you.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a very bright
sky out in space.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:47.700 align:middle line:90%
It's very bright.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.530 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of stars.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:55.200 align:middle line:84%
So when everything is off,
wherever my focal point

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.790 align:middle line:84%
I was going to make a
certain sound of music that's

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.560 align:middle line:90%
from that corner of space.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And so it's nothing other than
awe inspiring and conscious

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.240 align:middle line:84%
altering to be in the
absolute emptiness of space,

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.640 align:middle line:84%
and you start to
hear everything.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And I've been told when I asked
an ET about this, he said,

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:17.020 align:middle line:90%
oh, yeah, that's how it works.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.850 align:middle line:84%
He said, a lot of species
navigate that way.

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:22.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you understand what
you're listening for,

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:25.240 align:middle line:84%
you know where to look,
what to listen for,

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.390 align:middle line:84%
and you follow the navigation of
the music that you listen for.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look,
if you were ever lost

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:33.430 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't know how
to get back to Earth,

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:36.950 align:middle line:84%
he said, you just find your
focal point on where you know

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:39.530 align:middle line:84%
the direction is, and
listen for Earth music,

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.065 align:middle line:90%
and then follow that.

00:25:42.065 --> 00:25:43.940 align:middle line:84%
That was a completely
mind blowing experience

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.270 align:middle line:90%
that I did not expect.

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, are you listening to
music, I mean, from Earth?

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Are you looking for
a frequency that you

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.000 align:middle line:90%
are aligned with from Earth?

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Are you receiving old video
transmissions from back

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.350 align:middle line:84%
in the TV time of antennas
and things like that?

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>> From what I understand,
by putting your focal point

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:11.420 align:middle line:90%
on that, that's what happens.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.360 align:middle line:84%
That is just what you'll start
to hear, what you start to hear

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.440 align:middle line:90%
and perceive.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And is it some sort
of omnidirectional thing

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.870 align:middle line:84%
that's in your
conscious doing it?

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Because you must be
bombarded with trillions

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.180 align:middle line:90%
of pins of this information.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It's specific to where
your eyes are actually looking

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.040 align:middle line:90%
at it.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.940 align:middle line:90%
Is directed by your vision.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So what you're looking
at with your eyes

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.130 align:middle line:90%
is where the focal point is.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So I found as my eyes
were looking around,

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:42.020 align:middle line:84%
it was like changing
channels on a radio station.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>> That would make sense,
because the eyes can pinpoint

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:51.320 align:middle line:84%
photons and frequencies,
which your brain interprets.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.253 align:middle line:84%
And your consciousness
works with that sometimes.

00:26:54.253 --> 00:26:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's
still some mechanics.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand about it.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:58.790 align:middle line:90%
But I've experienced it, And.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:01.430 align:middle line:84%
It was absolutely
fascinating and mind blowing.

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And what a magical
experience to realize

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.810 align:middle line:84%
that the entire
universe makes music.

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's beautiful.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, yeah.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.640 align:middle line:84%
How much more amazing
can you get than that?

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe our third eye is just
one little antenna there that

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:15.370 align:middle line:90%
can read all this.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good theory.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:17.810 align:middle line:90%
I'll go with that.

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Randy, what a wonderful
adventure you've taken us on.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
on the show again.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so
much for having me.

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.230 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

>> When we see Pleiadian
shapes, we see a sphere of light

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:37.320 align:middle line:84%
because it is the miracle
of moving so fast.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.440 align:middle line:84%
The Atlantean civilization
was the product

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.090 align:middle line:90%
of Arcturian people.

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:46.560 align:middle line:84%
But the first Atlantis
was not about pyramids.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.500 align:middle line:90%
It was about the temple within.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.560 align:middle line:84%
They taught us how to
relate with the world.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Giants where the keepers of that
wisdom, of that information.
