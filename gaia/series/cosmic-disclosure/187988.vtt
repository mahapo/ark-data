>>EMERY SMITH:
Welcome to the show.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm Emery Smith.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.150 align:middle line:10%
I'm here again with David Adair.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.450 align:middle line:10%
David, welcome to the show.

you for having me.

>>EMERY: One of the things that
crossed my mind all the time

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.080 align:middle line:10%
is meeting someone like
you that has actually

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.390 align:middle line:10%
had hands-on experience
in-- we call them

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:10%
ARVs, alien
reproduction vehicles.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.980 align:middle line:84%
If we have an
extraterrestrial vehicle,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.590 align:middle line:84%
we will try to 3D
print these things.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.460 align:middle line:84%
We will scan them before even
touching them to make sure

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.710 align:middle line:84%
that there's nothing
too harmful in there

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:84%
or whether or not we should
open the device up or not.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.290 align:middle line:84%
You actually hand-carved,
from what I've heard--

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.090 align:middle line:90%

>>EMERY: --a vehicle.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.385 align:middle line:90%

[LAUGHS]

00:00:56.185 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:84%
I find all this funny because
you call it alien reproduction

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.480 align:middle line:90%
vehicles, ARV.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.910 align:middle line:10%
God, I've done this
all my life and I never

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.690 align:middle line:10%
thought it had a name like that.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.050 align:middle line:10%
My mother was a master
modeler, and so I learned

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.270 align:middle line:10%
building models from her.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking
about model kits.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about dragging out
a 100 or 500-pound block of clay

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.990 align:middle line:90%
and go to work on things.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.920 align:middle line:90%
That's how I built Pitholem.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't find a standard
off-the-shelf rocket body.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Everything was way
too weak, flimsy.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.405 align:middle line:84%
It'd be like trying to use
balsa wood against a battleship.

00:01:39.405 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.770 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: It's just a crazy
story the way it developed.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.450 align:middle line:10%
Art Bell was the first
to ask me about it.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:10%
And I came out and I said,
yeah, I built Pitholem

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.660 align:middle line:10%
out of this raw material
that General LeMay had

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:10%
to go find because, I said, the
rockets aren't going to work.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:10%
We built the engine.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.430 align:middle line:10%
Now we've got to build the
rocket around the engine.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And LeMay actually
liked that approach.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.820 align:middle line:84%
He said, that makes
sense actually.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.160 align:middle line:84%
But I told him, I need
different materials.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.690 align:middle line:90%
He goes, what kind of materials?

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.020 align:middle line:10%
Raw materials, stuff
that doesn't exist.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.560 align:middle line:10%
I said, I need something
extremely hard, take high heat,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.040 align:middle line:10%
and it can be heavy.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.687 align:middle line:10%
The heavier it is, the better
it is because, normally, that's

00:02:26.687 --> 00:02:28.020 align:middle line:10%
the opposite of a normal rocket.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.510 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.990 align:middle line:10%

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.750 align:middle line:90%
No, I had the problem.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.850 align:middle line:84%
I had a power curve
I was dealing with.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And that power curve
was telling me,

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:84%
you know, this thing
can launch a building,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:84%
so I've got to have
something heavy.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.990 align:middle line:10%
So LeMay, gone for a few days.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:10%

tells me, I think

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.160 align:middle line:10%
I've found a material
that would work.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.470 align:middle line:10%
We've got six tons of it.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.280 align:middle line:10%
Six tons, that should be enough.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle line:90%
How much volume is six tons?

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Because six tons of
aluminum would fill a room.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.390 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Six tons of lead would
just be the size of a desk.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.640 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: And he said, you
do think about this stuff,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.440 align:middle line:10%
don't you?

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.970 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah, I have to.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.512 align:middle line:84%
So he said, this is really
heavy and really dense.

00:03:18.512 --> 00:03:19.970 align:middle line:10%
I said, well, where
did you get it?

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.120 align:middle line:10%
He goes, England.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.175 align:middle line:10%
I said, yeah, what company?

00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:28.100 align:middle line:10%
He said, you know,
you can't know.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.390 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:90%
What's the origin of it?

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.900 align:middle line:84%
As far as you need
to know, unknown.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Who is they?

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, who?

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: And he goes, people.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, I know that.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.070 align:middle line:90%

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.550 align:middle line:90%
I said, people, OK.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:10%
Well did them people

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.685 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:03:45.685 --> 00:03:47.430 align:middle line:10%
I went, oh, God.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.958 align:middle line:10%
So the material comes in.

00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.375 align:middle line:10%

the floor and, I

00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:54.950 align:middle line:10%
mean, we're using

It's square.

It's a big block.

And we get the
packing off of it.

And normally, when something
like that would come in,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.688 align:middle line:90%

>>EMERY: Mm-hm.

00:04:14.488 --> 00:04:15.739 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: And I dig for labels.

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:16.539 align:middle line:90%

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.709 align:middle line:84%

what that was years later.

I didn't know at the time I was
looking at it, but S.H.A.P.E.

And Bob Dean, that's
where he worked.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.330 align:middle line:10%
He worked with Colonel
Corso, and both of them

were charged with finding
all foreign technologies.

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:55.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking at
that, I remember back

when I found the
S.H.A.P.E. thing,

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.847 align:middle line:84%

anyone to know I saw it,

And it would change colors
when lights hit it, you know,

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.120 align:middle line:10%
like a rolling sheen.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's the next
thing, the sheen of it.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.315 align:middle line:84%
It looked like it
was wet, so shiny.

That's a good question.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.010 align:middle line:84%
First thing I do when
something like that comes in,

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.690 align:middle line:90%
grab a Geiger counter.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Get a Geiger counter?

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.480 align:middle line:10%

on the Geiger counter,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.702 align:middle line:10%
but every time I got near it, my
hair would stand straight out.

00:05:37.702 --> 00:05:41.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, man, the
static electricity.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.887 align:middle line:10%
So I just had a
compass in my desk,

00:05:43.887 --> 00:05:45.720 align:middle line:10%
and I thought, well,
let's see what happens.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Get near it, man, the compass
just spun like a drill bit.

And I thought, God.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to see if
that sheen was all the way

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.720 align:middle line:84%
through the metal, or
if we're going to be

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.640 align:middle line:90%
dealing with some other color.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.770 align:middle line:84%
So I grab a drill
bit and drill on it,

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and the drill just slides
all over the surface,

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.065 align:middle line:84%
not making a single
scratch anywhere.

00:06:07.065 --> 00:06:08.220 align:middle line:90%
I said, fine.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
I'll get a punch and get
a foothold on this thing.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So I grab a punch and
about a five-pound hammer.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.360 align:middle line:90%
Ping!

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.890 align:middle line:84%
The punch went clear

Looked down, not a scratch.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.190 align:middle line:90%

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.320 align:middle line:10%
So LeMay comes in and
he says, how's it look?

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.380 align:middle line:90%
I said, pretty, nice and shiny.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.700 align:middle line:84%
I said, so damn hard I can't
even make a scratch on it.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.930 align:middle line:90%
You got any spec sheets?

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:41.950 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.840 align:middle line:90%
What's the flash point?

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.020 align:middle line:84%
We're going to probably
have to cast this thing.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.000 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at me.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.470 align:middle line:90%
He said, casting?

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you're going
to have to cast this.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, what's
the molds then?

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.022 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'll
have to make them.

00:06:59.022 --> 00:06:59.980 align:middle line:90%
And he's looking at me.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:84%
He goes, you can make
molds for this whole thing?

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure, it's modeling.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.860 align:middle line:90%
So he said, what do you need?

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.262 align:middle line:90%
500 pounds of modeling clay.

00:07:10.262 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:90%
So they bring in this--

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.387 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The next big chunk.

00:07:12.387 --> 00:07:14.863 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: The next forklift
comes in with a damn big block.

00:07:14.863 --> 00:07:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's a big block.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Oh, it was as
big as a sofa, a couch.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:84%
That's what we use
to make cars with.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:84%
I look like a Ford
engineer over there.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm just thinking of
you and Lamborghini back there.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, exactly.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You know, shaving
off these edges of this craft.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.135 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well,
that's what I did.

00:07:29.135 --> 00:07:31.770 align:middle line:84%
I just rolled the thing out
in the middle of the room

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and started doing my
measurements off the engine.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to build
the body around the engine.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.260 align:middle line:90%
It's no big deal.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.820 align:middle line:84%
You get all these clay tools,
your shapers, bends, spoons,

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:42.690 align:middle line:90%
all this stuff.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And you start scraping and
scraping and modeling it

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.830 align:middle line:84%
and look at it by eye and
just keep working on it.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, about a week
later, I finally

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:59.200 align:middle line:84%
get the first mold section
done, and it fits perfectly

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.400 align:middle line:90%
with the engine.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.518 align:middle line:90%
That's the front half.

00:08:01.518 --> 00:08:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Then there's a second
half on the backside.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.380 align:middle line:10%
The engine's right in
the middle of the rocket.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mm-hm.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.976 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: The whole idea is to--

00:08:07.976 --> 00:08:10.690 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's very
simple physics.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.720 align:middle line:84%
You blow up a
balloon, let go of it.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:12.880 align:middle line:90%
You go--

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.740 align:middle line:90%
[IMITATES DEFLATING]

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.040 align:middle line:90%
It takes off.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.530 align:middle line:84%
As the air is pushing on the
end of the balloon and it's

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:24.130 align:middle line:84%
coming out the nozzle,
thrust, rocket or jet engine.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.090 align:middle line:90%
In this case, it's a rocket.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.560 align:middle line:84%
So what the air is pushing
on the end of the balloon

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.230 align:middle line:90%
we call a diffuser wall.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.997 align:middle line:84%
So I had to build the
first-- the diffuser wall.

00:08:35.997 --> 00:08:37.789 align:middle line:84%
That's what the engine
is going to push on.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: This is
the Pitholem engine.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Right.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So I had to build
a cradle for the engine

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:90%
to fit into.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And it cannot be, you know,
ribs or beams or brackets.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:59.120 align:middle line:84%
No, we're talking solid
metal, four feet thick.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.257 align:middle line:84%
And people go, well, that thing
will never get off the ground.

00:09:02.257 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:90%
Uh-uh.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.098 align:middle line:84%
I'm working on a power
curve you've got to see.

00:09:06.098 --> 00:09:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And that's why you
need this special material?

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.590 align:middle line:84%
I would've welded a safe on
it if it would've worked.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.320 align:middle line:84%
I just need tremendous
weight to slow it down.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.490 align:middle line:84%
The problem is not going to be
not enough speed getting up.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:24.210 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to keep it contained
because this whole system isn't

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.580 align:middle line:90%
made to be launched from Earth.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.340 align:middle line:84%
It's really designed to
be launched in space.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to have to
overcome the power curve

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.470 align:middle line:84%
problem because that power curve
is going to launch an Empire

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.190 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I'm dealing with.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.520 align:middle line:84%
The ascension is going
to be so fast, that thing

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.180 align:middle line:84%
is going to be red hot
going through the atmosphere

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.240 align:middle line:84%
like they do when they
come in on a descent.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.100 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: I'm going to have
the same problem going ascent.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh yeah.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:54.100 align:middle line:90%
That's how fast you're going.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So what speeds
are we looking at?

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Eventually,
when we get to launch,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.620 align:middle line:84%
I cover 125 miles
in 3.2 seconds.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So you make this mold.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.790 align:middle line:90%
And now the next step is what?

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, we sprayed
polyurethane onto the mold

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.070 align:middle line:90%
to make it hard.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.490 align:middle line:10%
And then we lifted
it out of there,

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.440 align:middle line:10%
and all the Air Force
people lifted it out.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.300 align:middle line:10%
Then we would crate
it up, and we send it

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.580 align:middle line:10%
to some place LeMay had.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.435 align:middle line:10%
And I said, man,
what kind of furnace

00:10:26.435 --> 00:10:27.810 align:middle line:10%
are you going to
melt this thing?

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.700 align:middle line:10%
You won't tell me
the flash point.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:10%
Either you know and you're not
telling me or you don't know.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.460 align:middle line:84%
I said, it's got
to be incredible.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.410 align:middle line:90%
I said, we need the sun.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:39.520 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at me.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, how
perceptive of you?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we're using nuclear fire.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, God
almighty, you're

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.800 align:middle line:84%
going to use a nuclear
furnace, wherever that is.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.550 align:middle line:10%
So anyway, we send
the casting off,

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:10%
and then I work on
the second parts

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.960 align:middle line:10%
and some intermediate
parts, but I make

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:10%
casting parts for everything.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:10%
Finally get it all
done, and I remember--

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:10%
you know, we're doing
this in sections, right?

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing's
not been put together.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And LeMay was already
starting to-- he's keeping a--

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.310 align:middle line:84%
it's like I'm
under a microscope.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:20.500 align:middle line:84%
But he's already seeing
what the overall look's

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.240 align:middle line:90%
going to be when I'm done.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.390 align:middle line:90%
And he said, god almighty.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle line:84%
He goes, I've seen
some rockets in my day.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.480 align:middle line:84%
He said, that thing looks like
something from another world.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:90%
And I said, hmm.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.825 align:middle line:84%
More people were
right than you think.

00:11:37.825 --> 00:11:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You were inspired.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I guess so, and you're
channeling it, they call it.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.295 align:middle line:84%
But I got all the castings
done, sent them out,

00:11:45.295 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and I've never told anybody
this part of the story.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.020 align:middle line:10%
Nobody's ever asked me.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.650 align:middle line:84%
The more you get down
to the nuts and bolts,

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:57.220 align:middle line:84%
all this keeps rolling out
because, well, first of all,

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.740 align:middle line:84%
you're making me
remember everything.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I remember clearly seeing myself
in the shop on that clay mold.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.530 align:middle line:84%
I looked like a mud
diver for a week.

And your feet would
stick to the floor.

Air Force people came in and
scraped up a lot of stuff,

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.000 align:middle line:90%
and they helped.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.800 align:middle line:90%
But anyway--

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They probably thought
you were just a slob back

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.020 align:middle line:90%
there--

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, well-- no,
they actually thought--

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --covered
head to toe with this.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:25.710 align:middle line:90%
I can see you with this clay.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.168 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They were
very supportive.

00:12:27.168 --> 00:12:28.950 align:middle line:84%
They just thought
this whole project--

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.140 align:middle line:90%
some of them were experienced--

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.437 align:middle line:90%
what you call black op people.

00:12:32.437 --> 00:12:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure, yeah.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So God knows
what they've seen.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.520 align:middle line:84%
But they would come up
to me and go, damn, kid.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.150 align:middle line:84%
I know you're only 17, but
I've been at this for years.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.750 align:middle line:84%
I've seen stuff I can't
even begin to tell you.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.650 align:middle line:84%
But I want to tell you, you
are out there on the edge.

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.910 align:middle line:84%
You are so far out there,
you're coming back.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.750 align:middle line:90%
And I went, whatever that means.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But he said, really
cool-looking stuff you're doing.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.990 align:middle line:84%
So we send everything
off, and LeMay tells me

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.330 align:middle line:90%
about the material.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:06.200 align:middle line:90%

You know, please,
God, for God's sake,

tell me something
what I'm working with.

He's a lying-- you know,
he don't know nothing.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.000 align:middle line:84%
That's what they froze Han
Solo in in "Star Wars."

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.690 align:middle line:90%
He's just copying it.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:30.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm from the South.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.292 align:middle line:10%
I approach English as
a second language, OK?

00:13:33.292 --> 00:13:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Come from the land where y'all
is singular and all y'all is

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.020 align:middle line:90%
plural.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.540 align:middle line:10%
So it's carbnite, not carbonite.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:45.890 align:middle line:84%
C-A-R-B-N-I-T-E, that's what
I'm working with, carbnite.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Carbonite is what you
froze Han Solo in.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Stuff's called carbnite.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.970 align:middle line:84%
There's only six tons of it
in the world, and that's it.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.490 align:middle line:90%
Origin, unknown.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.760 align:middle line:90%
Other specs on it, unknown.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know, it could
have been a crate that

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:90%
fell off an alien cargo ship.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.265 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It had to
come from somewhere.

00:14:07.265 --> 00:14:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, but, God, it was
nothing like I've ever seen.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering,
is the sheen still

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.270 align:middle line:84%
going to be there after going
through a nuclear furnace?

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:20.120 align:middle line:10%
You know, is it going to
be flat in color or what?

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:25.050 align:middle line:10%
Well, the first parts came
back and we opened them up.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And I swear to god,
the exact same sheen's

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:33.822 align:middle line:84%
there, completely shaped
into the casting I made.

00:14:33.822 --> 00:14:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And I got the old
punch and hammer again.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Uh-huh.

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Can't
make a mark on it.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, God almighty,
who's working this stuff?

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:49.450 align:middle line:10%
So anyway, all the parts
came back in, hooked it all

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:53.870 align:middle line:10%
together, Pitholem was born.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.070 align:middle line:10%
That was June 20, 1971.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.650 align:middle line:10%
But to get to this point
I'm telling you about,

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:05.638 align:middle line:10%
26 and a half months, seven
days a week, 14, 16 hours a day.

00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You used
all six tons of it?

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: All of it.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.430 align:middle line:90%
There's no more of this.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:14.560 align:middle line:10%
So one half of phase
one is where we're at.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.230 align:middle line:84%
I want to go all the
way to phase four,

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:21.160 align:middle line:84%
but come to find out, they
stop at one half of phase one.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:27.260 align:middle line:84%
They got what they wanted,
a speed vehicle in like--

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What kind of cargo?

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, that
was to be determined.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.432 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
they wanted to do.

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:35.000 align:middle line:84%
But come to find out
later, they wanted

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.850 align:middle line:84%
to put a thermonuclear
warhead on it

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.260 align:middle line:90%
and aim it at the Soviet Union.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.350 align:middle line:84%
But there's more designs
to the whole thing.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a bigger
program than just me.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm part of the program.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.830 align:middle line:10%
The whole program was--

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:54.720 align:middle line:10%
you've got to know General
LeMay, chief of the Joint

00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:00.180 align:middle line:10%
Chiefs, nicknamed Bombs Away
LeMay, bombed the living

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.870 align:middle line:10%
daylights out of everything that
was living in World War II, one

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:08.010 align:middle line:10%
of the principal people
responsible for our success

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.660 align:middle line:10%
in World War II.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.210 align:middle line:84%
He became the chief
of the Joint Chiefs,

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:16.890 align:middle line:84%
designer of the B-52
Stratofortress, founder of SAC,

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Strategic Air Command,
our nuclear defense force.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Massive.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Guy's got
massive oomph with him.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:10%
And he's the one that said
in history, to the North

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.130 align:middle line:10%
Vietnamese, if you don't come
to the Paris peace talks,

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.830 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to bomb you
back into the Stone Age.

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:44.800 align:middle line:84%
That's who said
it, General LeMay.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Next day, he's fired by
Secretary of Defense Robert

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.370 align:middle line:90%
McNamara.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.960 align:middle line:90%
Did that slow him down?

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.620 align:middle line:84%
No, it was like stepping
on the accelerator

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.420 align:middle line:84%
because, if you just
look a pictures of him,

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:01.080 align:middle line:90%
he's not going to be fired.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:06.300 align:middle line:10%
So he's got designs,
and what he wanted was--

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:10.210 align:middle line:10%
he wants the B-52s
retired, replaced

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:10%
by 45 XB-70s called a Valkyrie.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.930 align:middle line:10%
This Valkyrie thing
you had to see.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:24.550 align:middle line:10%
It's a delta wing bomber.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.660 align:middle line:90%
The delta wing is gigantic.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:90%
It'd fill a football field.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.390 align:middle line:84%
People walk on it and they
look like specks on this thing.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.270 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted to
take the Valkyrie,

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.615 align:middle line:84%
take Pitholem, shove a couple
Pitholems into Valkyrie.

00:17:39.615 --> 00:17:40.663 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, goodness.

00:17:40.663 --> 00:17:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: You come in
2,000 miles an hour

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:47.590 align:middle line:84%
to fail-safe, to the Soviet
radar net, open up the bomb

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:48.390 align:middle line:90%
bay doors.

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And just as you're penetrating
fail-safe, drop Pitholem out.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Here she goes into
ludicrous speed.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.970 align:middle line:84%
The Soviets will look on
the scopes and see a streak

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.800 align:middle line:90%
and go, what's that?

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.363 align:middle line:84%
And by the time they say,
what's, they're dust.

00:18:04.363 --> 00:18:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: They're gone.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: They're gone.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:12.120 align:middle line:84%
So they win MAD, mutual
assured destruction,

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.300 align:middle line:90%
a program we live under today.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And it goes that, you're
America, I'm Soviet Union.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.130 align:middle line:84%
If we attack each
other, you can be

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:22.010 align:middle line:84%
mutually assured we're
going to kill each other,

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:24.450 align:middle line:90%
and we don't fight.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:27.915 align:middle line:84%
However, if you've got
first strike capability,

00:18:27.915 --> 00:18:33.737 align:middle line:84%
it means I hit you so fast
you can't retaliate, I win.

00:18:33.737 --> 00:18:34.945 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: This is about speed.

00:18:34.945 --> 00:18:36.653 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I'm pulled
into all this stuff.

00:18:36.653 --> 00:18:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, goodness.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.778 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And they didn't
tell me anything about this.

00:18:39.778 --> 00:18:42.263 align:middle line:84%
I'm learning it, finding
out as we're going--

00:18:42.263 --> 00:18:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So basically,
you're telling me the fastest

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:47.490 align:middle line:90%
person to kill the planet wins.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Exactly.

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.467 align:middle line:10%
So the whole thing was
just what it was, mad.

00:18:51.467 --> 00:18:52.800 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: This is how they think.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.270 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: Crazy.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:10%
And they were so
focused on one thing,

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:01.420 align:middle line:10%
that I delivered a
really fast vehicle.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.670 align:middle line:10%
It's really simple.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.040 align:middle line:84%
They just wanted
something really fast.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.240 align:middle line:90%
Gave it to them.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.130 align:middle line:84%
But what the idiots
are missing, it's

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:13.040 align:middle line:84%
like they're getting a
kiss through a screen door

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.350 align:middle line:84%
or taking a shower
with a raincoat on.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.600 align:middle line:84%
They're missing
the whole program.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.140 align:middle line:84%
If you work with me on this
and let me finish all the way

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.370 align:middle line:84%
to phase four,
this thing's going

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.510 align:middle line:84%
to give you gifts that
you're not going to believe.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: You're going to end
up with inertia dampeners.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.060 align:middle line:84%
You're going to end
up with force fields.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:10%
You're going to end
up with star travel.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.020 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not talking "Star Trek."

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.670 align:middle line:90%
They're slow.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:43.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we could have had
for real, not some TV series.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what led
you to blow this up?

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.520 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: Well, I found
out what they want to do,

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.790 align:middle line:10%
and Pitholem was sitting
out on the desert floor.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:10%
Just flew in, literally
just landed with parachutes,

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:03.160 align:middle line:10%
and dropped right down on where
they wanted at Groom Lake.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
this is just great.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:10%
How do you blow up
a top-secret weapon

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.720 align:middle line:10%
system that's on
a secret Air Force

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.972 align:middle line:10%
Base that doesn't even exist?

00:20:15.972 --> 00:20:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And you're 17 years old
and you're by yourself.

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:20.290 align:middle line:90%
How are you going to do that?

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.780 align:middle line:10%
Somebody tell me what to do.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.530 align:middle line:10%
So I look down at
the big hangar doors,

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.450 align:middle line:10%
and there's a hub
of a big wheel and I

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.520 align:middle line:10%
see it sitting in the hub.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.350 align:middle line:10%
It's graphite grease.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:37.150 align:middle line:10%
So I go over there
and just really wasn't

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.370 align:middle line:10%
pretending that
much, just sobbing.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.183 align:middle line:10%
And that bothered
Arthur Rudolph.

00:20:41.183 --> 00:20:42.850 align:middle line:10%
It was like fingernails
on a chalkboard.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.270 align:middle line:10%
He couldn't stand it.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.650 align:middle line:84%
So I start whining
and crying, saying,

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:47.650 align:middle line:90%
I need to see my rocket.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to
take it away from me?

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.820 align:middle line:84%
He just can't-- you
know, he's a sociopath.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.280 align:middle line:90%
I knew that would bother him.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:84%
So I'm leaning against the
door, slide down, put my hand--

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.170 align:middle line:90%
get a wad of graphite grease.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.000 align:middle line:84%
So finally, Rudolph said, shut
him up and take him out there

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.700 align:middle line:90%
and let him see his rocket.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So we get in this
golf cart thing

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:90%
and we go riding out there.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That was the mistake.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That was a big
mistake on their part.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.450 align:middle line:10%
So I get out there and
I still have the key

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:16.190 align:middle line:10%
to the side panels.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:20.240 align:middle line:84%
So open the doors and
take the graphite grease

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and shove it down
into the induction

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:25.810 align:middle line:90%
tube of the cyclotron.

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Close everything back up, set
the cyclotrons on 60 seconds,

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:32.750 align:middle line:90%
and they'll start winding up.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:37.063 align:middle line:84%
And ask anybody what happens
when deuterium meets graphite,

00:21:37.063 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:84%
especially if it's compressed
to the speed of light.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Very hot.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:42.750 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, violent reaction.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:45.142 align:middle line:10%
So we're in the golf cart.

00:21:45.142 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:10%
And I turn around and
tell these guards--

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.017 align:middle line:10%
they don't know any better--

00:21:48.017 --> 00:21:49.780 align:middle line:10%
hey, this thing's
got a fuel leak.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.300 align:middle line:90%
It's going to explode.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.180 align:middle line:90%
We have got to get out of here.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.920 align:middle line:90%
So I jump in the cart.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.920 align:middle line:10%
They look at each other.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.990 align:middle line:10%
They jump in the cart
and figure, God almighty.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:02.340 align:middle line:84%
So they said, what's
a safe distance

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:03.930 align:middle line:90%
to get away from the explosion?

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.781 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, God, what
if this thing goes nuclear?

00:22:07.781 --> 00:22:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at them
and said, Chicago?

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.720 align:middle line:90%
And the guards go--

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.340 align:middle line:84%
they step on that
thing and we're just

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.125 align:middle line:90%
hitting the high spots.

00:22:18.125 --> 00:22:19.750 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sitting there
going, well, gee,

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:22.547 align:middle line:10%
I hope it stays conventional.

00:22:22.547 --> 00:22:23.505 align:middle line:90%
Never done this before.

00:22:23.505 --> 00:22:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Find out.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: We'll find out.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And we get to the main
hangars and I get out.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm walking toward
Rudolph, then all of a sudden,

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:34.160 align:middle line:84%
there's this flash
on the hanger.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.040 align:middle line:10%
And I'm thinking--

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:35.873 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Oh, my God.

00:22:35.873 --> 00:22:38.825 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: --oh, God, that
looks like a nuclear flash.

00:22:38.825 --> 00:22:40.940 align:middle line:10%
So I spin around real
quick and I thought, well,

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.250 align:middle line:10%
I'll make a good
shadow on a wall.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.130 align:middle line:10%
And it was a
conventional explosion,

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:50.840 align:middle line:10%
but God almighty, the
concussion wave floored us all.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Rudolph, guards,
we all went down.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And Rudolph gets up
and he asks the guards,

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:01.040 align:middle line:90%
what did he tell you?

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.440 align:middle line:84%
See, that's how
smart this guy is.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.850 align:middle line:90%
He said there was a fuel leak.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.555 align:middle line:10%
And he looks at me
and he goes, there's

00:23:06.555 --> 00:23:08.180 align:middle line:10%
no such thing as a fuel leak.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.900 align:middle line:10%
So he walks over to
me and he looks at me,

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.860 align:middle line:10%
grabs me by my arms, and
he rolls my hands over.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.050 align:middle line:90%
There's the graphite grease.

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:20.300 align:middle line:90%
And how fast is he?

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Turns around and looks
at the hangar doors.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.440 align:middle line:90%
He was brilliant.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:10%
And I got hit right
then by him, backhand.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.130 align:middle line:84%
He was a little old
grandfather-looking guy.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.360 align:middle line:90%
Man, he could hit.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's a line on
the inside of my lip.

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:41.370 align:middle line:84%
He pushed my lower
teeth through my lip.

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was a bad hit.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:50.590 align:middle line:10%
And I'm on all fours and
bleeding all over the concrete

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:53.410 align:middle line:10%
and I'm spitting
all this blood out.

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.690 align:middle line:90%
Here all these guns go cocking.

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, man, it's just
getting worse by the minute.

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So I look up and the guns
aren't pointed at me.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.720 align:middle line:90%
They're pointed at Rudolph.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.560 align:middle line:10%
Their fathers fought
Rudolph in World War II.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:14.020 align:middle line:10%
These guys have just
seen this sociopath

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:20.795 align:middle line:10%
Nazi hit a Midwest teenager
badly in front of them,

00:24:20.795 --> 00:24:22.420 align:middle line:10%
so they all pull
their guns on Rudolph.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.698 align:middle line:84%
And I spit all this blood
out and I tell Rudolph,

00:24:25.698 --> 00:24:27.615 align:middle line:84%
you don't look like
you're in charge, Rudolph.

00:24:27.615 --> 00:24:28.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, no you didn't.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.120 align:middle line:90%
I got him wound up a little bit.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And he told everybody,
stand down, pick him up,

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:41.280 align:middle line:90%
and they did pick me up.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:47.790 align:middle line:10%
And then they took me to a
room in the hangar bay area,

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:51.650 align:middle line:10%
went out the back of the
hangar to some other building,

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:53.290 align:middle line:10%
and I got locked in this room.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.370 align:middle line:84%
The only thing, hanging
is one light bulb

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:59.810 align:middle line:84%
by a wire and a door, and
that's it, no windows, nothing.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And Rudolph, on the
way over, stopped

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.360 align:middle line:84%
at this lab-looking room,
looked like an ER room.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.627 align:middle line:84%
And he pulls back this
sheet, and there's

00:25:08.627 --> 00:25:09.710 align:middle line:90%
this cadaver laying there.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.085 align:middle line:90%
It's a 17-year-old male.

00:25:11.085 --> 00:25:11.885 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Hm.

00:25:11.885 --> 00:25:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Same height
and weight as me.

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And he said this will be burnt
and sent back to my parents

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.920 align:middle line:84%
and said I was killed
at White Sands,

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.520 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be here for
the rest of your life.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is a guy who's killed
over 100,000 people personally

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.920 align:middle line:84%
in metaverse in
Peenemunde when they

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.980 align:middle line:90%
were building the V-2 rockets.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there
going, oh, I am so screwed.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.810 align:middle line:90%
So they throw me in this room.

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:37.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting there.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Pitholem's gone, I'm
bleeding, and I'm

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.580 align:middle line:90%
going to be here forever.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.890 align:middle line:10%
And I'm looking at
that cord going,

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:47.860 align:middle line:10%
I wonder if I could
electrocute myself.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.870 align:middle line:10%
So I was there probably--

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:53.153 align:middle line:10%
I don't know, maybe eight hours.

00:25:53.153 --> 00:25:54.320 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: That's a long time.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.545 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: And I hear this
noise out in the hallway.

00:25:56.545 --> 00:26:00.730 align:middle line:10%
And it's all this cussing and
people being thrown around.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And the door is kicked
open, and there's

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:06.370 align:middle line:84%
this big square-shouldered
silhouette

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:07.600 align:middle line:90%
with a stogie like this.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And he's got this colonel
of Area 51's tie wrapped

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.310 align:middle line:84%
around his hand, and banged
his head on the wall.

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:17.080 align:middle line:90%
And he looks at him.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.300 align:middle line:10%
He said, who did that?

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we
didn't, we didn't.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:25.210 align:middle line:10%
Arthur Rudolph did
and he just left.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:26.035 align:middle line:10%
Where is he?

00:26:26.035 --> 00:26:27.760 align:middle line:10%
He took off in his own plane.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.410 align:middle line:10%
Find him.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:30.430 align:middle line:10%
And I know the voice.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.633 align:middle line:10%
It's General LeMay.

00:26:32.633 --> 00:26:33.550 align:middle line:90%
So he's looking at me.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.100 align:middle line:84%
He said, get him out from
there, clean him up, and put him

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.510 align:middle line:90%
on my plane.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:41.678 align:middle line:10%
And I was sitting
there and we took off,

00:26:41.678 --> 00:26:43.720 align:middle line:10%
and we flew all the way
back to Wright-Patterson.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.762 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What happened to
the program after that?

00:26:45.762 --> 00:26:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Well, he told me--

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:48.950 align:middle line:90%
he's looking at me.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And I just looked at me, and
I had an ice pack on my lip.

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, why
did you come and get me?

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.880 align:middle line:10%
He said, well, when Rudolph had
Colonel Williams arrested back

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.520 align:middle line:10%
at White Sands and put him in
his quarters and house arrested

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.320 align:middle line:10%
him--

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.930 align:middle line:10%
Williams is not a wussy.

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:11.760 align:middle line:90%
He was a blue beret.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.345 align:middle line:84%
So he overpowered his guards,
got to a radio, called me

00:27:15.345 --> 00:27:19.920 align:middle line:84%
at Wright-Patterson, told
me where they took me,

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.720 align:middle line:84%
and he said, I flew
straight out here.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.455 align:middle line:10%
And I'll let you in on
a couple of secrets.

00:27:25.455 --> 00:27:28.080 align:middle line:90%


00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.290 align:middle line:84%
LeMay may have been
retired at the time,

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.410 align:middle line:84%
but he could fly in and
out of those bases at will.

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:36.835 align:middle line:84%
When you're that former
chief of the Joint Chiefs--

00:27:36.835 --> 00:27:37.635 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:27:37.635 --> 00:27:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: --four-star
general, that's a lifetime.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And the colonel that he was
throwing around the hallway,

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.270 align:middle line:90%
he put him there.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Who do you think
appoints the personnel--

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Of course.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: --to these big bases?

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.670 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:54.675 align:middle line:84%
He's big bad Bombs
Away LeMay and all.

00:27:54.675 --> 00:27:56.300 align:middle line:10%
But he looked at me
and he said, you're

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.810 align:middle line:10%
about the same age
as my grandkids.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.122 align:middle line:90%
I just couldn't leave you there.

00:28:00.122 --> 00:28:02.580 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm going to burn the
paper trails and everything,

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:03.380 align:middle line:90%
and he did.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.340 align:middle line:84%
But he missed some
stuff and I found it.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And he told me, he left
me with this warning.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.830 align:middle line:90%
He said, they're not through.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.670 align:middle line:90%
Rudolph's not through.

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:15.090 align:middle line:84%
His alphabet soup groups
aren't through with you.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:18.480 align:middle line:84%
They still very much want
a first strike system.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.180 align:middle line:84%
You're the hottest
ticket there is.

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.780 align:middle line:84%
He said, the only thing you've
got to defend yourself with

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.720 align:middle line:84%
is let them kill you before
you ever build another rocket.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.870 align:middle line:90%
Don't ever build another one.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:30.670 align:middle line:90%
Because if you do--

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Then they'll
kill you after.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:31.620 align:middle line:90%
It's definite, yeah.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.078 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah,
that's what he said,

00:28:33.078 --> 00:28:35.280 align:middle line:84%
then they'll kill you
and take it again.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Just don't ever build one.

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I don't know
what's going to happen next.

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.722 align:middle line:90%
Where did the molds go?

00:28:45.722 --> 00:28:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: They never came back.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Ah, that's right.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.120 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't.

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.162 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: They kept them--

00:28:50.162 --> 00:28:51.245 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That makes sense.

00:28:51.245 --> 00:28:52.140 align:middle line:90%
We'd do the same.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: --at casting.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: So everything's gone.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And see, there's
another vital part

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.670 align:middle line:90%
that I skipped in the story.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.650 align:middle line:84%
My dad smoked a
pipe all the time,

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.290 align:middle line:90%
and he and I would sit and talk.

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:04.740 align:middle line:90%
And he felt bad for me.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:08.220 align:middle line:10%
He says, you know,
you're just a kid.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.127 align:middle line:10%
And this whole thing going
on with the Air Force,

00:29:11.127 --> 00:29:12.960 align:middle line:10%
you building this rocket,
he said, you know,

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.835 align:middle line:10%
things are going to get
out of hand probably.

00:29:14.835 --> 00:29:15.990 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:19.940 align:middle line:84%
If they do and I ever
talk to you and I'm gone

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and I call back and
I say, everything's

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.110 align:middle line:84%
fine, just light your
pipe and take it easy,

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.560 align:middle line:84%
if I tell you to light
your pipe, go into the lab,

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.820 align:middle line:84%
pull everything out, all the
drawings, all the books--

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.245 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: --everything,
burn everything.

00:29:33.245 --> 00:29:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Burn the models.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.308 align:middle line:90%
Burn everything.

00:29:36.308 --> 00:29:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Leave the building
where it is because it's

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:42.270 align:middle line:84%
kind of a cool facility,
but burn everything else.

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:48.950 align:middle line:10%
So when I was at
Area 51, Groom Lake,

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:50.270 align:middle line:10%
they showed up at our house.

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:50.585 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Ah

00:29:50.585 --> 00:29:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And all they found
was this real irate drunk man

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:55.760 align:middle line:84%
in the back with a lot
of smoke and ashes.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And they were pissed,
but they left.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And LeMay said, you done
destroyed your prototype,

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.860 align:middle line:90%
you wiped out the lab.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:08.250 align:middle line:84%
He said he would do his part
and wipe out paper trails,

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to make it
very difficult for them.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.580 align:middle line:90%
It's only going to be you left.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.610 align:middle line:90%
So I went back--

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:16.750 align:middle line:84%
let's see-- back to
Wright-Patterson.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Car took me all the way back
to my home in Mount Liberty.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And I went to school
that fall, and that's

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.270 align:middle line:84%
how I spent my summer vacation
as a junior, my high school

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:27.190 align:middle line:90%
year.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.360 align:middle line:90%
The fall was quiet.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.380 align:middle line:90%
Winter was quiet.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.390 align:middle line:90%
Spring, I graduated.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:34.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm in graduation line shaking
hands with the parents,

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:39.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a cap and gown, I got a
full scholarship to Ohio State

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:41.590 align:middle line:90%
in theoretical astrophysics.

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:44.180 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be a professor,
teach the rest of my life,

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.126 align:middle line:90%
keel over, that's it.

00:30:45.126 --> 00:30:45.492 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:30:45.492 --> 00:30:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So I'm shaking
hands with the parents.

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:48.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm going to--

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:54.060 align:middle line:84%
and I grab this hand over
here and it's ice cold.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:57.640 align:middle line:84%
I turn around and it's
two guys in black suits,

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:01.420 align:middle line:84%
white shirts, little skinny
ties, mirror sunglasses.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.510 align:middle line:84%
What is it with these guys
and that attire, you know?

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:07.240 align:middle line:90%
And he hands me this letter.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And I open it up and it
says, greetings, I'm drafted.

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.590 align:middle line:90%
It's June 10, 1972.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They're
making you join.

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The war's almost over.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: The draft didn't
shut down until 1975.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: This is June 10,
1972, and they grab me.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm in cap and gown.

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:27.340 align:middle line:84%
They drag me across
the parking lot.

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.825 align:middle line:84%
And all the kids are
wondering what's going on.

00:31:30.825 --> 00:31:31.625 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:31:31.625 --> 00:31:33.422 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And on my
DVD, they actually

00:31:33.422 --> 00:31:34.880 align:middle line:84%
find these kids
and interview them.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.130 align:middle line:84%
They said, yeah, we don't
know what happened that day.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:39.960 align:middle line:84%
They drug him off, threw
him in a blue station wagon,

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:40.802 align:middle line:90%
and he was gone.

00:31:40.802 --> 00:31:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So there was
a lot of witnesses.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we heard him
yell to his parents something

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:49.290 align:middle line:90%
about legal conscription.

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:52.930 align:middle line:84%
It means that they can
physically take you legally.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:53.840 align:middle line:90%
So they did.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And a couple hours later, we're
at Port Columbus in Columbus,

00:31:58.450 --> 00:31:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Ohio at the airport.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:03.360 align:middle line:84%
We go down to the end to
MAT, Military Air Transport,

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.180 align:middle line:84%
and there's Rudolph
waiting with a jet.

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mm-mm.

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:09.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time you've
seen him since the incident.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Since then.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, no.

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.278 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That's
who's orchestrating

00:32:11.278 --> 00:32:13.570 align:middle line:90%
the whole damn thing.

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:17.750 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know there's this
internal civil war going on.

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I get out
of the station wagon.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.630 align:middle line:10%
Rudolph and his guys
come out, and they

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:27.070 align:middle line:10%
pull their MPK5s and
whatever, and they're

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.840 align:middle line:10%
looking big and bad.

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And then another truck pulls
up behind our station wagon.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.830 align:middle line:10%
All these Air Force guys jump
out, got all theses M16s.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.320 align:middle line:90%
They all cock and load.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Now they're pointing
guns at each other.

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, no.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:43.210 align:middle line:90%
This is a huge contest--

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, and
I'm going, oh, God.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.605 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: --of who gets you.

00:32:45.605 --> 00:32:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Who gets me?

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.138 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing there
in between them.

00:32:48.138 --> 00:32:50.620 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I should just
start a firefight right here,

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.200 align:middle line:84%
die in the middle of it,
and be the end of it.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.060 align:middle line:84%
But I was looking at
all these young guys,

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and I could see they
wanted to go home.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.260 align:middle line:10%
So I walked over
to Colonel Williams

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.940 align:middle line:10%
and said, let me go
with him, Rudolph,

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.750 align:middle line:10%
and let all your guys go home.

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.473 align:middle line:10%
I'll deal with this.

00:33:07.473 --> 00:33:08.390 align:middle line:10%
Williams looked at me.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:09.310 align:middle line:10%
He said, you sure?

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:11.335 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, just let me go.

00:33:11.335 --> 00:33:12.623 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's very brave.

00:33:12.623 --> 00:33:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, I didn't want any
of these people to get shot up.

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:17.680 align:middle line:90%
So I got on board with Rudolph.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.280 align:middle line:90%
We take off.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And a few hours later, there we
are, Langley, home of the CIA.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.930 align:middle line:90%
And then Rudolph starts in.

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:34.865 align:middle line:10%
I'm put in this room that
looks like a hospital room--

00:33:34.865 --> 00:33:35.665 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Hm.

00:33:35.665 --> 00:33:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: --with a bed and the
oxygen things and all that.

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
this doesn't look good.

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:44.500 align:middle line:10%
They wheel in this big stainless
steel table, and I'm going,

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.570 align:middle line:10%
oh, brother.

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So I grab a chair and
commence going at it,

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:51.550 align:middle line:90%
and I'm overpowered.

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:55.442 align:middle line:10%
Rudolph comes in next with
his friends in lab coats.

00:33:55.442 --> 00:33:56.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm stripped naked.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm tied to this table.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:00.890 align:middle line:90%
Rudolph looked at me.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.600 align:middle line:84%
He said, been waiting
to see you again.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And he throws this
cloth on this table

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.969 align:middle line:84%
and it was all these
needles and little vials.

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking, trying
to read the bottles.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.913 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing sodium
pentothal, sodium barbital,

00:34:14.913 --> 00:34:15.830 align:middle line:90%
all the sodium family.

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Truth-telling serums.

00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Man, they stick it in in this
hand, right on that vein,

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:23.840 align:middle line:90%
and it feels like liquid fire.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And it got up to
right about my neck,

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:26.842 align:middle line:90%
and that's the last I remember.

00:34:26.842 --> 00:34:29.190 align:middle line:90%


00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:31.190 align:middle line:84%
You're only supposed to
be under for 30 minutes.

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They mind
swept you, yeah.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:35.830 align:middle line:90%
30 minutes is the limit.

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:39.909 align:middle line:84%
They went at me for three
days, day and night.

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And I came around somewhere
a day and a half into it.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.335 align:middle line:84%
And I was laying there, and
I can remember one guy saying

00:34:47.335 --> 00:34:50.595 align:middle line:84%
to Rudolph, if you do him again,
he's going to be an eggplant,

00:34:50.595 --> 00:34:51.395 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:34:51.395 --> 00:34:52.953 align:middle line:90%
And Rudolph said, I don't care.

00:34:52.953 --> 00:34:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You'll
be all gorked out.

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:34:55.170 --> 00:35:01.240 align:middle line:84%
I need to know the info out of
the construction of this fusion

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.710 align:middle line:90%
device.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:07.560 align:middle line:84%
So he was sitting in
there by whoever, CIA

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:11.940 align:middle line:84%
probably, still after
the first strike device,

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.090 align:middle line:90%
and they can't get it.

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So I finally come back
to and I'm laying there.

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:21.190 align:middle line:84%
You ever come out from under
this stuff, it's amazing.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:23.710 align:middle line:84%
You can talk and
answer questions,

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:25.108 align:middle line:90%
but you're not there.

00:35:25.108 --> 00:35:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Lights are on, but
there ain't nobody home.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No one's there.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.720 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: So I finally
focused into where

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.480 align:middle line:10%
everybody's in the room.

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And the guy is
asking me a question.

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:40.490 align:middle line:84%
He said, how do you
feel about missiles?

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:43.950 align:middle line:84%
I ain't building any
more, I can tell you that.

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:45.957 align:middle line:84%
And so he comes back,
goes outside the room.

00:35:45.957 --> 00:35:47.040 align:middle line:90%
You hear people out there.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.393 align:middle line:90%
He comes back in.

00:35:48.393 --> 00:35:49.810 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel
about jet engines?

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:51.980 align:middle line:90%
I went, they're defensive.

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.800 align:middle line:90%
I could work on that.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.010 align:middle line:84%
So they tell me, you're
not going to Camp Lejeune.

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:59.170 align:middle line:84%
You're going to Great
Lakes, Illinois.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:00.140 align:middle line:90%
You're in the Navy.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, my.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And they
get through there,

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:05.290 align:middle line:84%
and then they send me to
Pensacola, the Naval training

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:05.545 align:middle line:90%
schools.

00:36:05.545 --> 00:36:06.345 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:36:06.345 --> 00:36:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, I graduated
first in my class,

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:14.622 align:middle line:90%
and they sent me to Norfolk.

00:36:14.622 --> 00:36:15.795 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Good old Norfolk.

00:36:15.795 --> 00:36:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They were
stuck on something.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:22.800 align:middle line:90%
This is 1972, '73.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And you know what Norfolk
was at that moment?

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.590 align:middle line:90%
Detroit of the F-14.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Really?

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That's
where it was built.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.317 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's right.

00:36:30.317 --> 00:36:32.550 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: So I'm sitting
there, and they told me,

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:35.880 align:middle line:10%
we've got 5,000
engineers stymied

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.160 align:middle line:10%
on the turbines of the F-14.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:45.180 align:middle line:84%
They cannot find to get a ratio,
you know, one to 15, one to 16.

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:51.180 align:middle line:10%
The power needed, this is going
to be a fighter bomber, first

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.570 align:middle line:10%
of its kind.

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:54.910 align:middle line:10%
So I looked at it.

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:56.120 align:middle line:10%
I said, what's your problem?

00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.290 align:middle line:10%
And they show me the problem and
said, what can you do for it?

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:02.290 align:middle line:10%
Let me sit down
and work with them.

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:03.790 align:middle line:10%
So I'm working on
it, working on it.

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:06.640 align:middle line:10%
In about three weeks,
I'm done, and I give them

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:12.090 align:middle line:10%
a set of turbines, one to 26,
10 times what they could get.

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:15.210 align:middle line:10%
And the F-14's power plant
was born and so was the F-14.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:16.110 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Mm.

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:18.240 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: I was 19
when I did that.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.565 align:middle line:84%
There was so much work to
do in conventional world.

00:37:20.565 --> 00:37:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.017 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: And they
found out that I

00:37:23.017 --> 00:37:26.858 align:middle line:10%
was like, you know, just
a born problem solver.

00:37:26.858 --> 00:37:28.650 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: You were more
effective with that.

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:29.450 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAIR: Yeah.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:33.280 align:middle line:10%
The Navy soon found out this
boy's handier than a button

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.320 align:middle line:10%
on a shirt.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.050 align:middle line:10%
Everything we throw
on him, he fixes.

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:39.505 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Amazing story.

00:37:39.505 --> 00:37:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: But I sure mopped
out some problems for them.

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You sure did.

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And because of you, I think
the world's a better place.

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, David, for
coming on the show.

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Thanks for having me.

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Glad to be here.

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And until next
time, I'm Emery Smith.

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:53.890 align:middle line:90%
We'll see you then.

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:57.240 align:middle line:10%
