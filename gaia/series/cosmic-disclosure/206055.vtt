>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.740 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty,
a retired special agent

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.720 align:middle line:10%
who served in the
Air Force Office

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.340 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.570 align:middle line:90%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are discussing
the Stallion Range incident.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.650 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So where is
the Stallion Range,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.980 align:middle line:90%
and what exactly happened there?

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Stallion Range
is an Air Force radar

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.250 align:middle line:84%
site located in the northern
part of White Sands test

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.260 align:middle line:90%
range in New Mexico.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.450 align:middle line:84%
It's about 35 miles southeast
of Socorro, New Mexico.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.300 align:middle line:84%
Stallion Range was
at that time in 1982

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.580 align:middle line:90%
a top-secret radar facility.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.450 align:middle line:84%
It was used to track
high-altitude objects

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.050 align:middle line:90%
in space objects.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.850 align:middle line:84%
It also contained a laser, a
very highly classified laser

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.250 align:middle line:84%
that the National Security
Administration used.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.920 align:middle line:84%
When Soviet satellites-- now,
this isn't still classified,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.720 align:middle line:90%
Emery.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.980 align:middle line:84%
But as Soviet satellites
passed overhead in the '80s,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.670 align:middle line:84%
there would be a laser fired
up from Stallion Range,

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.560 align:middle line:84%
following that Soviet
satellite and blinding it

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.900 align:middle line:84%
so the Soviet
satellites, they weren't

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.980 align:middle line:84%
able to photograph anything on
the ground in a certain area.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it was located.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, still located
there at Stallion Range.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, what
incident happened

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.850 align:middle line:84%
were there was a
craft that landed

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.520 align:middle line:90%
near this laser, this building?

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, the
radar facility tracked

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.520 align:middle line:84%
an aircraft or unidentified
aircraft flying in

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.600 align:middle line:90%
from the west.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.740 align:middle line:84%
The aircraft was coming
in toward Stallion Range.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:84%
There was two radar
technicians out working

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.009 align:middle line:90%
on a radar some distance away.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.940 align:middle line:84%
As they started driving
back towards their home base

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.160 align:middle line:84%
facility at Stallion Complex,
they observed a UFO land.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.000 align:middle line:84%
The UFO landed in a field
south of the complex,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.180 align:middle line:84%
but near the laser facility,
which was guarded by Air Force

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:90%
security.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.765 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How far away
was it from the facility

00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:30.640 align:middle line:90%
and from the complex?

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It was
probably 600, 700 feet.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:34.975 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's very close.

00:02:34.975 --> 00:02:35.775 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:02:35.775 --> 00:02:37.150 align:middle line:90%
Very close to the perimeter.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And it was witnessed
by these two technicians.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: These two
technicians witnessed it,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.240 align:middle line:84%
and they saw two entities
getting out of this UFO

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.050 align:middle line:90%
and approaching their vehicle.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So the two Air Force personnel,
these radar technicians,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.560 align:middle line:84%
were Air Force, a
technical sergeant

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.910 align:middle line:90%
and the staff sergeant.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.000 align:middle line:10%
They got out of their vehicles
and approached these two

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:10%
entities as they were
walking towards them.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:10%
The entities tried
to communicate.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.710 align:middle line:10%
They spoke in a language
that the technicians

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.970 align:middle line:10%
didn't understand.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.460 align:middle line:10%
It was really very
high-pitched shrilling

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.620 align:middle line:10%
language, which was
very difficult for them

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.390 align:middle line:10%
to even listen to.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle line:90%
And then since we--

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.330 align:middle line:84%
the two technicians
weren't able to communicate

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.880 align:middle line:84%
with their language,
the two technicians

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.770 align:middle line:90%
started speaking English.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.260 align:middle line:84%
The two entities didn't
appear to understand

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:84%
anything that was being said
by these two technicians.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Then the entities started making
hand gestures, hand signals

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:90%
towards the two technicians.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And it appeared to
the two technicians

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:84%
that these two
entities were trying

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.970 align:middle line:84%
to get them to come onto the
craft, because at one point,

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:84%
one of the entities pointed
to their craft and motioned

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.120 align:middle line:84%
as if to ask them
or maybe even order

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.250 align:middle line:90%
them to come onto the craft.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.850 align:middle line:90%
This scared the two technicians.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Then one of the entities then
approached the two sergeants

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.500 align:middle line:84%
very close, within a few
feet, took out an object,

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.210 align:middle line:90%
and handed it to them.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:84%
That object was a long,
tube-shaped object.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:84%
The one technical sergeant
grabbed the object,

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.060 align:middle line:84%
looked at it, and then
immediately placed it

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.010 align:middle line:84%
on the ground,
fearing that it might

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.640 align:middle line:90%
be a weapon or radioactive.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:90%
This scared the two technicians.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
they moved back

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.810 align:middle line:90%
in towards the security complex.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Once they got towards
the security complex,

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:84%
two Air Force
security policemen,

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.880 align:middle line:84%
armed with a handgun on
their side and an M16 rifle,

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.150 align:middle line:90%
came out.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And they approached-- these
two security policemen

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:90%
approached these two entities.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.800 align:middle line:90%
And at this time, it appeared--

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.160 align:middle line:84%
I think the entities
then appeared

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.950 align:middle line:84%
to realize that these
two men approaching them,

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.020 align:middle line:90%
humans, were armed.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.628 align:middle line:84%
So they turned around and
went back to their spacecraft.

00:05:04.628 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they leave
their device there?

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The device was
left on the ground.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes, the device was left there.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.930 align:middle line:84%
The two entities got in the
spacecraft through steps,

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.990 align:middle line:84%
got up inside the bottom
part of this spacecraft.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.538 align:middle line:84%
And then a few seconds later,
the spacecraft took off.

00:05:22.538 --> 00:05:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did the
spacecraft look like?

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It was a round shape,
circular-shaped spacecraft,

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.600 align:middle line:90%
typical flying saucer-shaped.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Had a dome on top and
a dome on the bottom.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.540 align:middle line:84%
The bottom part
of the dome opened

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and steps came down,
came out to the ground.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the entities
exited the aircraft

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.830 align:middle line:84%
and then re-entered
the aircraft.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And after they
re-entered the aircraft,

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.790 align:middle line:84%
the bottom part of the dome
closed and kind of raised

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:90%
a little bit, and then left.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.090 align:middle line:90%
Now, interesting.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.060 align:middle line:84%
None of the-- either
the technicians, the two

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.420 align:middle line:84%
technicians or the two
security forces personnel,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.938 align:middle line:84%
they didn't see any struts
or any landing gear.

00:06:08.938 --> 00:06:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't figure out--
and this is something that was

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.240 align:middle line:84%
discussed with me when
I debriefed them later--

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle line:84%
was how this thing was just
hovering there, hovering

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, because there
was no struts that came out

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.390 align:middle line:90%
or any type of landing gear.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So after it left, then
these two technicians

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.880 align:middle line:84%
reported it to
their supervisors.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.350 align:middle line:84%
They then contacted--
the closest base

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.330 align:middle line:90%
was Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Stallion Range was a small radar
site manned by about 80 people.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.740 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have any
intelligence personnel there.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.360 align:middle line:90%
We serviced that location.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.180 align:middle line:84%
OSI from Kirtland would
service that location.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.760 align:middle line:84%
We were immediately
notified of the incident.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And the Explosive
Ordnance Disposal team

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:84%
from the US Air
Force at Kirtland

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.200 align:middle line:84%
was notified to come down
to get this object, which

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:90%
nobody knew what it was.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Some of the people at
the scene suspected

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.460 align:middle line:84%
it was some sort
of a translator,

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.270 align:middle line:84%
but that wasn't
determined until later.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, EOD came, picked
it up, transported it back

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:11.780 align:middle line:90%
to the base.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.700 align:middle line:84%
The two men were
then transported

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.560 align:middle line:90%
to Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:90%
They were medically examined.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.120 align:middle line:84%
All four of them were
medically examined, determine

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.720 align:middle line:84%
whether they were exposed to any
kind of radiation or anything

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.790 align:middle line:84%
else, whether they
were hurt in any way.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And they passed the
medical examination,

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and there wasn't any
radiation detected on them.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.960 align:middle line:84%
They also, I believe,
took blood from them.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.690 align:middle line:90%
And then I interviewed them.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And during the interview,
they explained to me

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.680 align:middle line:84%
what I just told you,
that they were out there,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.450 align:middle line:90%
working on a radar site.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.990 align:middle line:84%
They heard on their radio,
their two-way radios,

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:48.440 align:middle line:84%
that something was
coming in from the west.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And as they were driving on
a road towards their home

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.070 align:middle line:84%
complex, they saw it
through the windshield.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.380 align:middle line:90%
They saw something coming in.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
radio, the controllers

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.250 align:middle line:84%
inside were telling them that
this wasn't a known aircraft.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.770 align:middle line:84%
They tried to communicate
with the aircraft using

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.550 align:middle line:84%
different radio frequencies,
FAA frequencies,

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.610 align:middle line:90%
and the craft didn't respond.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And plus, of course,
they used the IFN system,

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.070 align:middle line:84%
the Identification
for Info Neutral,

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and realized it
wasn't communicating

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.940 align:middle line:84%
in any of the right,
proper frequencies.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, they
considered something other

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.472 align:middle line:84%
than a commercial plane
or a military plane.

00:08:28.472 --> 00:08:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But they
didn't attack it.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.770 align:middle line:84%
We didn't start attacking it
with ground-to-air missiles

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.450 align:middle line:90%
or had scrambled jets.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, once they saw that
coming in on the radar,

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.122 align:middle line:84%
why didn't they
initiate protocol?

00:08:41.122 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Well, they did.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.630 align:middle line:90%
They did initiate protocol.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.340 align:middle line:84%
The closest Air Force base
with fighters was at Kirtland,

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.340 align:middle line:90%
and they had A-7Ds on alert.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:90%
And they did scramble two A-7Ds.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.140 align:middle line:90%
But the incident occurred--

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.170 align:middle line:84%
the whole incident
occurred probably

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:00.950 align:middle line:90%
within a 20-minute time frame.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.840 align:middle line:84%
So by the time the jets got
there, the craft was gone.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.070 align:middle line:84%
It exited-- the radar operator
that I spoke with later

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:11.380 align:middle line:84%
inside the building, that
didn't actually come out

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.690 align:middle line:84%
but was inside the
building, tracked it.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was recorded on
radar, as they record them.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And the craft went from a few
thousand feet to 70,000 feet

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.530 align:middle line:84%
within a short time frame,
which they immediately

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.758 align:middle line:90%
knew that wasn't a--

00:09:27.758 --> 00:09:29.050 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't a conventional craft.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:30.550 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't an Air Force plane.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:34.360 align:middle line:84%
This radar technician told
me, I've tracked SR-71s.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.760 align:middle line:90%
I've tracked U2 spy planes.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I've tracked other aircrafts,
and even some that probably

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.920 align:middle line:84%
are still in the experimental
stage that flew from Area 51

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.890 align:middle line:84%
down to White Sands for
testing, and nothing--

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.310 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen anything fly
that fast and disappear off

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:52.510 align:middle line:90%
radar that quick.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did
the four soldiers

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:58.820 align:middle line:84%
explain to you of the details of
what these beings looked like?

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.390 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: The two technicians
advise that these entities

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.590 align:middle line:10%
were about four feet tall.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:04.690 align:middle line:10%
They were wearing a helmet.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:10%
But they had some kind of a
voice box or something that

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.990 align:middle line:10%
was amplifying their speech.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And their speech, according to
the technicians, was shrilling.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:20.410 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like somebody had
increased the sound of metal

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.120 align:middle line:90%
hitting metal.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.010 align:middle line:90%
And it was a shrilling--

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:25.630 align:middle line:84%
which, they had to
cover their ears.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.190 align:middle line:90%
It was hurting them.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
covering their ears,

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.390 align:middle line:84%
it appeared to them
that the entities

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.510 align:middle line:84%
realized that their
voice was hurting them.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So the voice, the tone of the
voice and volume of the voice

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:42.040 align:middle line:84%
went down somewhat,
but it was still

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:90%
almost unbearable to listen to.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And when the technicians
were speaking in English,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.920 align:middle line:84%
the entities looked at each
other as if not understanding

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.820 align:middle line:84%
anything that was being said,
or couldn't-- maybe even

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:59.770 align:middle line:84%
comprehending that these
humans were speaking.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.180 align:middle line:84%
According to the technician,
the senior technician

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.910 align:middle line:84%
there, the tech
sergeant, he said,

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:07.930 align:middle line:84%
it was like when we
spoke, they were confused.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And maybe our voice
maybe hurt them

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.180 align:middle line:90%
like their voice hurt ours.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.180 align:middle line:84%
They were in a
tight-fitting uniform,

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.420 align:middle line:84%
and they had really
heavy, thick boots on.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.250 align:middle line:90%
And they had mittens.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.690 align:middle line:84%
They had some kind
of mittens on,

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:25.090 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't
see their fingers.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, either that was their
hands or they had something on

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.790 align:middle line:90%
to cover their hands up.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:34.900 align:middle line:84%
They could move their hands
similar to like we did.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.080 align:middle line:84%
They had joints, because
they were making hand signals

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.090 align:middle line:90%
to the technicians.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And they were motioning
with their hands.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So their abilities to move
their arms and shoulders

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:48.997 align:middle line:90%
were similar to ours.

00:11:48.997 --> 00:11:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, you've mentioned
these types of beings and craft

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.963 align:middle line:84%
before in other "Cosmic
Disclosure" episodes.

00:11:54.963 --> 00:11:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Is there any correlation
that you guys came up with,

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.980 align:middle line:84%
why these beings are
showing up at these bases

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.288 align:middle line:84%
with all this technology
and nuclear activity?

00:12:03.288 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: That's a very
interesting question,

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:05.980 align:middle line:90%
because we did.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:06.970 align:middle line:90%
We did analysis.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.560 align:middle line:84%
I didn't actually
do the analysis,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.040 align:middle line:84%
but other people within
the intelligence community

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.360 align:middle line:90%
did the analysis.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we realized
that this event occurred,

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and there had been
other events earlier.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And then we, of course, had
events that happened later

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:29.200 align:middle line:84%
with this same type of entity,
the same type of ET dressed

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.870 align:middle line:90%
in almost identical outfits.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Then our analysts
tried to determine

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.380 align:middle line:84%
whether these entities were
the same entities that occurred

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.920 align:middle line:84%
previously, and even some
that I didn't know about

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.350 align:middle line:84%
that I was informed
of later on that

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.630 align:middle line:84%
had happened in the
mid '70s before I

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.190 align:middle line:90%
had gotten into intelligence.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:52.450 align:middle line:84%
They came to the conclusion
that it is the same ET

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.660 align:middle line:90%
race that are visiting bases.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're primarily
visiting military bases.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Army, Air Force, and
even some Navy bases.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And why they're doing
this, maybe it's

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:middle line:84%
trying to make
contact in some way.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.990 align:middle line:84%
But again, we can't get in the
head of an extraterrestrial,

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.480 align:middle line:84%
so it's very difficult
to try to figure out

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.690 align:middle line:84%
what their train of thought
is or what they're thinking

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.620 align:middle line:84%
or what their reason is
for visiting these bases.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Maybe just
reconnaissance too?

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things you mentioned

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.670 align:middle line:84%
is sometimes they don't
land right on the base,

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:31.540 align:middle line:90%
but near the base.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Like, this is a landing that's
actually not on the base.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:90%
It's near a radar laser device.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Right.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Stallion Range is
about five miles south

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.780 align:middle line:84%
of the main road,
which is US 380.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And the Air Force security
gate is about three miles

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.640 align:middle line:90%
from the complex.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.380 align:middle line:90%
But there's no fences.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.650 align:middle line:84%
The only fences
around that area is

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:01.010 align:middle line:84%
the fence around the radar
complex and the laser complex

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.050 align:middle line:90%
facility.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:09.800 align:middle line:84%
They call it a long-range
RASER complex, as abbreviated.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's about half a mile
away from the main controlment

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.160 align:middle line:84%
area of the base
of the radar site.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.870 align:middle line:84%
But there's no fences, so
it's possible for people

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.490 align:middle line:90%
to come in and walk in.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:84%
But this craft landed really
close to the laser facility,

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.710 align:middle line:84%
a few hundred feet
away, which would

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.230 align:middle line:84%
have put up the red flag,
because that complex is

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:34.880 align:middle line:90%
a Priority A resource.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.270 align:middle line:84%
In the United States Air
Force, Priority A resources

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.520 align:middle line:90%
is guarded with deadly force.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.580 align:middle line:84%
These Air Force security
policemen in there

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:48.350 align:middle line:84%
had M16 rifles of full
loads and a handgun--

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.490 align:middle line:90%
I believe a .38 revolver--

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.750 align:middle line:84%
and they were guarding that
facility with deadly force,

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.960 align:middle line:84%
meaning if you tried to
get in to that facility,

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.247 align:middle line:90%
they could use deadly force.

00:14:58.247 --> 00:15:00.080 align:middle line:84%
They would challenge
you and then shoot you,

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:84%
and that's the way the military
operates in a Priority A

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:04.920 align:middle line:90%
complex.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now speaking
of this laser,

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.670 align:middle line:84%
you said it was there to
blind the Soviet satellites.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Was there any other
abilities the laser had?

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Ironically,
they had just

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.870 align:middle line:90%
installed this newer laser.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.980 align:middle line:84%
I think it was within the
last three months or something

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:21.780 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
exact time frame.

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:28.180 align:middle line:84%
But the older laser
only did certain things.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.930 align:middle line:84%
They could just point
it in one direction.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And the newer laser system there
in 1982 that they installed

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:37.050 align:middle line:90%
could do more.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:39.510 align:middle line:84%
It could function in
different manners.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things it
could do is project an image.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:47.360 align:middle line:90%
And so they could send this--

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.940 align:middle line:84%
shoot this laser up
with an image somehow--

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how it
actually operated--

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.470 align:middle line:84%
against the lens of
the Soviet satellite

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:84%
and project an image
of what we wanted

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:01.400 align:middle line:84%
the Soviets to see as the Soviet
satellite was passing over.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure they did it
with maybe other country's

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.120 align:middle line:90%
satellites too.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.290 align:middle line:84%
But that was one of
the operational feats

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:10.880 align:middle line:90%
that it could do.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.535 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it possible,
Rick, that this laser being

00:16:14.535 --> 00:16:16.910 align:middle line:84%
so powerful-- you know, we
use these out in the field all

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.880 align:middle line:90%
the time to attract craft--

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.562 align:middle line:84%
that was maybe a
beacon for them?

00:16:22.562 --> 00:16:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they saw this
laser and said,

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.910 align:middle line:84%
hey, let's go follow this laser,
see where it's coming from.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: That was the thought
of several scientists

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and several of the analysts
that looked into this case,

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:39.320 align:middle line:84%
was that this might have been
some form of a beacon sending

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.870 align:middle line:84%
out in space,
because a laser can

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.420 align:middle line:84%
travel an infinite
direction, especially out

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.660 align:middle line:90%
of the atmosphere.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And so they thought that maybe
we were sending a message out

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.990 align:middle line:84%
somehow to the ETs out there
that are flying around.

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:56.810 align:middle line:84%
What you're got to
understand about 1982,

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:01.100 align:middle line:84%
laser technology was really
just on the drawing boards.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:05.569 align:middle line:84%
The military had some very
highly classified projects,

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:09.349 align:middle line:84%
both with light lasers
and then chemical lasers.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And Kirtland Air
Force Base was a base

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:16.550 align:middle line:84%
that was experimenting with
airborne laser, aircraft

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:84%
with a laser inside, and they
were flying that and testing it

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.280 align:middle line:90%
down at White Sands.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:84%
This ground-based laser
was new, was something--

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.670 align:middle line:84%
as I said earlier, the newer
system had just came out.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So they were constantly
developing the laser.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the
scientists told me,

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:84%
these lasers are not easy to
control when they shoot them

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:90%
out there with high intensity.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very
possible that we were

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.770 align:middle line:90%
sending a beacon out in space.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.060 align:middle line:90%
And this happened before.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.910 align:middle line:84%
This happened at
Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.370 align:middle line:84%
They had one at
Kirtland Air Force Base

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:58.300 align:middle line:84%
about 80 miles away
out in Coyote Canyon.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And the incident
in Coyote Canyon

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:84%
occurred, and we were
probably doing the same thing.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And unbeknownst to us,
that we were attracting

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.620 align:middle line:90%
the extraterrestrials.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:13.201 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were the
extraterrestrials ever--

00:18:13.201 --> 00:18:14.975 align:middle line:84%
did they ever come
across that they

00:18:14.975 --> 00:18:18.140 align:middle line:84%
were being violent or
threatening to the airmen

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.140 align:middle line:90%
and soldiers?

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: No.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.315 align:middle line:84%
The tech sergeant and staff
sergeant and the two security

00:18:22.315 --> 00:18:25.790 align:middle line:84%
police personnel
never felt threatened.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:26.630 align:middle line:90%
They were scared.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.660 align:middle line:84%
They were concerned
because they'd never

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.470 align:middle line:90%
seen these entities before.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they were
somewhat scared.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.853 align:middle line:84%
Especially the
radar technicians.

00:18:36.853 --> 00:18:38.270 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
the same training

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:42.860 align:middle line:84%
as a security forces person had,
and they didn't have weapons.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.320 align:middle line:84%
When the security
personnel came out,

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.140 align:middle line:84%
one of the security
policemen told me

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:84%
that it shook him
up pretty much.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.460 align:middle line:84%
But he realized he had a mission
to do, and he had to protect.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.350 align:middle line:84%
They never pointed
their weapons--

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:84%
they never took their
M16s off their shoulders,

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and they never
drew their weapon--

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.150 align:middle line:84%
their handgun out of their
holster, because they

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:06.770 align:middle line:90%
didn't feel threatened.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Now I asked him, well,
what if you were there

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.400 align:middle line:84%
when they were
bringing this tube out?

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And one of them said, I
probably would have drawn

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:90%
my side arm, my .38 revolver.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And who knows what would have
happened if that happened,

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.260 align:middle line:90%
that incident occurred?

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.990 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't, and they
didn't feel threatened.

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Isn't there
some sort of protocol

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:34.080 align:middle line:84%
that the Air Force security has
if an extraterrestrial craft

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.500 align:middle line:84%
were to land, if beings
were to come out?

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yes, there is
protocol, but not for ETs.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.020 align:middle line:90%
There's protocol for intruders.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:50.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was contained
in an Air Force regulation.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:52.751 align:middle line:90%
I believe it was 207-1.

00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:57.480 align:middle line:84%
I can remember, because that was
a question that was brought up

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.940 align:middle line:90%
during an after briefing.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.480 align:middle line:84%
A critical incident
review, they called it.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.580 align:middle line:84%
The security forces
did this, and I

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.560 align:middle line:90%
happened to be invited to this.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And one of the questions I
asked was, do you have protocol?

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Do you have policy
and procedures

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.710 align:middle line:90%
that if this happened?

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:90%
And the senior NCO in the room--

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.290 align:middle line:84%
I believe he was a
chief master sergeant,

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:25.500 align:middle line:84%
a highest ranking
enlisted person--

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:34.510 align:middle line:84%
he said, in SAC bases, around
nuclear weapons sites, we do.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:37.000 align:middle line:84%
But this wasn't a
nuclear weapons site.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.070 align:middle line:90%
This was not a SAC base.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.422 align:middle line:84%
And the security policemen
weren't in the room.

00:20:41.422 --> 00:20:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Those two weren't
in this room when

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.920 align:middle line:84%
we were doing this
after-incident critical

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.748 align:middle line:90%
briefing.

00:20:46.748 --> 00:20:48.790 align:middle line:84%
They had never been briefed,
and they didn't have

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.350 align:middle line:90%
the security clearance for it.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.930 align:middle line:84%
We never thought anything
like that would happen.

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.900 align:middle line:84%
But I said, so you
do have a procedure.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.590 align:middle line:90%
And he kind of looked at his--

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:01.090 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was a captain--
maybe even a major in the room.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:01.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:02.130 align:middle line:90%
It was a major.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:02.950 align:middle line:90%
It was a major.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.010 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes, we do.

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:07.720 align:middle line:90%
I said, it's classified?

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.940 align:middle line:90%
He said, yes, it's classified.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.780 align:middle line:90%
We do have a document--

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.880 align:middle line:90%
it's an annex to--

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and he gave me the
Air Force Reg 207-1.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.050 align:middle line:90%
He said, but it's classified.

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:22.790 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
few documents that we

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.920 align:middle line:90%
keep that are classified.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.990 align:middle line:84%
But he said, that
only pertains to SAC

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:30.260 align:middle line:84%
bases and nuclear weapons
storage facilities.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:35.130 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, you might want
to start briefing these airport

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:84%
security policemen
guarding these radar sites.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:41.750 align:middle line:84%
He said, your
recommendation will

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.060 align:middle line:90%
be taken into consideration.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So I never actually
saw the document.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.002 align:middle line:90%
I know one exists.

00:21:48.002 --> 00:21:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I'm
quite fascinated

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:53.240 align:middle line:84%
by the soldiers
with the weapons not

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.370 align:middle line:84%
having a knee-jerk reaction
to immediately attack.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:57.170 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, that
was my question,

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:02.030 align:middle line:84%
because security
police personnel--

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:07.880 align:middle line:84%
if this was a human, an intruder
approaching that facility,

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.800 align:middle line:84%
they would have
operated differently.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And I asked one of the
security policemen.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:16.430 align:middle line:84%
I said, if this was a
person rushing your facility

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.795 align:middle line:84%
with a gun, a
handgun, or a rifle,

00:22:19.795 --> 00:22:21.420 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't you have
operated differently?

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.550 align:middle line:90%
He said, absolutely.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:25.440 align:middle line:90%
We would have challenged them.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And if they kept coming,
if they came within--

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.820 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a
five-foot or seven--

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:31.620 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.780 align:middle line:90%
There's a particular zone.

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.670 align:middle line:84%
If they enter that
zone towards the fence,

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.010 align:middle line:84%
they were authorized
to use deadly force.

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And he told me, if they got
within that particular zone,

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.700 align:middle line:90%
we would have shot them.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.830 align:middle line:84%
We would have notified the
command center and tell them,

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.450 align:middle line:90%
you know, we've got an intruder.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
time these things

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:84%
happened so quick when
there was actually

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.290 align:middle line:84%
a human approaching that
we wouldn't have even time

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:56.190 align:middle line:90%
to call on the radio.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:58.398 align:middle line:84%
We'd just shoot them, and
then we'd notify them, hey,

00:22:58.398 --> 00:22:59.400 align:middle line:90%
we just shot a person.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.740 align:middle line:84%
So I ask him, I
said, well, when you

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.340 align:middle line:84%
saw these entities,
these extraterrestrials,

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what was the first
thing you thought of?

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:11.580 align:middle line:84%
He said, well,
somehow we felt calm.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And when they told me that, I
didn't go in any more details.

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.580 align:middle line:90%
I said, you felt calm?

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:90%
He said, yeah.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:24.450 align:middle line:84%
We just didn't feel that
they were a threat to us.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:28.290 align:middle line:84%
So then later on
when I did my report,

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned these psychological
or physiological things, traits

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.320 align:middle line:90%
that were mentioned to me.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not a
psychologist, but it

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.995 align:middle line:84%
got to one of ours
who then came to me.

00:23:42.995 --> 00:23:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Said, we need to sit down
and talk to these people,

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:49.380 align:middle line:84%
because it looks to me, it looks
like the psychologist that we

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.810 align:middle line:90%
used-- he's a hypnotist too--

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:56.730 align:middle line:84%
looks to me like these
ETs put some kind

00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:01.770 align:middle line:84%
of a spell or something on
these people to relax them.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily change them
in any way, but something

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.900 align:middle line:84%
that they could project
onto a human that

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.040 align:middle line:90%
made the human relax.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a threat to you.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Please don't use your
weapon towards me.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:20.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm here as a friend or
we're here as a visitor.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:22.030 align:middle line:90%
Something to that respect.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It could be emitting
some calming frequency

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:29.280 align:middle line:84%
and they were picking up on
this and were completely relaxed

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.720 align:middle line:90%
with the situation.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Plus, it's kind of like a rabid
dog coming at you, you know?

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:39.172 align:middle line:84%
And then a dog coming, wiggling
its tail, and you feel calm.

00:24:39.172 --> 00:24:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: That's very possible.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, the two security
personnel-- and I

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:47.400 align:middle line:84%
believe the other two were
examined by this psychologist.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't there at the time.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:52.230 align:middle line:84%
He did his own report, so I
don't know what was ever--

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:57.660 align:middle line:84%
but the consensus later
was that these ETs

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.810 align:middle line:90%
were able to relax the humans.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Because all four of them
said the same thing.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:09.500 align:middle line:84%
We immediately felt that these
two entities weren't hostile,

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.370 align:middle line:84%
and we weren't
threatened by them.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:14.130 align:middle line:90%
They seemed to be very friendly.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Except when they
brought out this object,

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.230 align:middle line:84%
which they thought at
first was a weapon.

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:22.380 align:middle line:84%
But at that point, the
security people weren't there.

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.000 align:middle line:90%
They were still inside.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.155 align:middle line:84%
But when the tech sergeant
grabbed it and then placed it

00:25:28.155 --> 00:25:29.760 align:middle line:84%
on the ground,
then they realized,

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.140 align:middle line:90%
ah, we need to get some help.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they went
back towards the gate,

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.310 align:middle line:84%
and that's when the
security forces came out.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So did the ETs have
the ability to change

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:44.070 align:middle line:90%
the frequencies of the human?

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.350 align:middle line:84%
They were so advanced,
they may have

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:51.720 align:middle line:84%
some other type of abilities
that we just don't know,

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:58.680 align:middle line:84%
because this has happened other
times before and then later on.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.900 align:middle line:84%
The same feeling
came over humans that

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.790 align:middle line:90%
were in contact with these ETs.

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You spoke
of the linguistics

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:08.280 align:middle line:84%
that neither one could
really on both sides

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.810 align:middle line:90%
understand each other.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:14.550 align:middle line:84%
But were there any reports from
the soldiers or the technicians

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:19.950 align:middle line:84%
that maybe telepathy was used
or anything emotional was felt?

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: That was a
question that I didn't ask,

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:84%
but the psychiatrist
inquired about,

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.330 align:middle line:84%
whether they'd felt
or heard anything

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:31.305 align:middle line:84%
in their heads such as
a telepathic message.

00:26:31.305 --> 00:26:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And as far as I
know, there wasn't

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:36.660 align:middle line:90%
any type of telepathic message.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.951 align:middle line:84%
But I never actually
asked either one of the--

00:26:39.951 --> 00:26:42.510 align:middle line:84%
any of the four
technicians that question.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:44.290 align:middle line:90%
It was brought up later.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, you told us they
received this cylindrical item.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Metal was passed off from
the ETs to the technicians,

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.910 align:middle line:84%
and then it was taken
to Kirtland Air Force

00:26:56.910 --> 00:27:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Base where they did an
evaluation and testing on it.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.040 align:middle line:90%
What did they come up with?

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Explosive Ordnance
Disposal specialists came.

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.510 align:middle line:90%
They checked it for radiation.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:10.110 align:middle line:84%
They checked it for any kind
of weapons or explosives.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.050 align:middle line:84%
They didn't feel it was
any kind of weapons system.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:14.790 align:middle line:90%
They placed it in a container.

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:16.650 align:middle line:84%
They transported it
back to Kirtland.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.350 align:middle line:84%
They the EOD did some
more tests on it,

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:22.110 align:middle line:84%
just to rule out whether
it could be something

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:26.175 align:middle line:84%
hid-- any radioactivity,
gamma source, beta source,

00:27:26.175 --> 00:27:27.000 align:middle line:90%
any of that.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.545 align:middle line:90%
And they ruled anything out.

00:27:28.545 --> 00:27:30.940 align:middle line:84%
The EOD brought it
over to our office.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.310 align:middle line:90%
It was in a box.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:middle line:90%
And they said, here.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.063 align:middle line:90%
And so we said, OK.

00:27:36.063 --> 00:27:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you
personally saw it?

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: I personally saw it.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:39.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And explain
it in more detail.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: OK.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.910 align:middle line:90%
It's about 20-some inches long.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Inside was some sort of a
crystal or something inside.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.610 align:middle line:84%
When you spoke,
the crystal moved.

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:56.220 align:middle line:84%
We, myself, and
several other agents,

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.470 align:middle line:84%
one of our technical
agents came in.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And you know, he was
trying to figure it out.

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.520 align:middle line:90%
It was made of some metal.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.910 align:middle line:90%
It was a brassy, colored metal.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying metal, or material.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.830 align:middle line:90%
The only thing that moved--

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:14.460 align:middle line:84%
the only kind of a source,
electrical source or anything

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.240 align:middle line:90%
is this little rock or crystal.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And it would vibrate.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah, it vibrated.

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:21.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the scientists came
over to my office and sat down.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:23.720 align:middle line:90%
He said, it's a fascinating--

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.550 align:middle line:84%
he said, what it
is is a translator.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:32.720 align:middle line:84%
But it has to be
activated by the ET voice,

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and it's only going to
translate from the ET

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.667 align:middle line:84%
into maybe English
or other languages.

00:28:40.667 --> 00:28:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Because he said, we
couldn't get it to work.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.550 align:middle line:90%
We tried everything.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:46.430 align:middle line:84%
We try to make
any type of noise,

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.380 align:middle line:84%
squeaking sound that
we could into it.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.340 align:middle line:84%
The little crystal moved,
but there was nothing

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.540 align:middle line:90%
coming out the other end.

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:54.915 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why would
they speculate

00:28:54.915 --> 00:28:55.970 align:middle line:90%
that it's a translator?

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Was there some other
intel they had?

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:06.072 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the colonel
told me out of the blue,

00:29:06.072 --> 00:29:09.110 align:middle line:84%
not in the report that
I got but on the phone,

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:14.382 align:middle line:84%
he said, it's similar to some
other items that we have here.

00:29:14.382 --> 00:29:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, that
perked my interest.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.860 align:middle line:84%
I said, you have
other customers.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:24.280 align:middle line:84%
He said, we have many other
customers bringing us gifts.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I assumed he meant
other intelligence officers.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wasn't the only
one doing what I was doing.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.970 align:middle line:90%
There's 100-- there were 119--

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:38.480 align:middle line:84%
122 of us in the United
States or around the world

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.030 align:middle line:84%
that were doing exactly
the same thing I was doing.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And there were other
people within New Mexico

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:43.785 align:middle line:90%
doing the same thing.

00:29:43.785 --> 00:29:45.520 align:middle line:90%
We had Holloman Air Force Base.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.260 align:middle line:84%
We had one of my
colleagues there.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.938 align:middle line:84%
And we had Cannon Air Force
Base, and one of my colleagues

00:29:51.938 --> 00:29:53.980 align:middle line:84%
there was doing the exact
same thing I was doing.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.770 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't always share--

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.540 align:middle line:90%
I wish we had have.

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:02.470 align:middle line:84%
So I knew then that
it wasn't something

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.705 align:middle line:84%
that Los Alamos-- it
wasn't the first time they

00:30:04.705 --> 00:30:06.340 align:middle line:90%
had seen something like that.

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do we
have any idea where

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:11.170 align:middle line:84%
this extraterrestrial
craft originated from

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:12.280 align:middle line:90%
and these beings?

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, I'm not
briefed into everything.

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:18.970 align:middle line:90%
I do the report.

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:84%
I collected the radar
tapes, sent everything

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.320 align:middle line:90%
to our headquarters.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.640 align:middle line:90%
And the consensus--

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.380 align:middle line:90%
I didn't learn it right then.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I learned it sometime
later on another case--

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:33.130 align:middle line:84%
was that this craft
were somehow--

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and these ETs were somehow
related to the Ebens,

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.980 align:middle line:90%
but they weren't Ebens.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:43.900 align:middle line:84%
They were either some
offshoot of the Ebens

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.480 align:middle line:84%
or they were some--
maybe something

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that were created by the
Ebens, which we knew occurred.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.630 align:middle line:90%
We knew that the Ebens had--

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:57.970 align:middle line:84%
they created some humanoid
or robot/humanoid entities

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:00.460 align:middle line:84%
that were responsible
for some abductions.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And they suspected
that they were somehow
