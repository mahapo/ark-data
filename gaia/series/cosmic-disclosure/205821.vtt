>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.800 align:middle line:10%
we are with Richard Doty,
a retired special agent

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.540 align:middle line:10%
who served in the
Air Force Office

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.130 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO/ET-related

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.040 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are going to discuss
an extraterrestrial incident

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:90%
in the Soviet Union.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.575 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome.

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:39.880 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's not often we
learn about ET-related incidents

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.130 align:middle line:90%
from the former Soviet Union.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.130 align:middle line:84%
What can you share with us
from your investigations?

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: In January
of 1985, there

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.060 align:middle line:84%
was an incident that occurred in
Soviet Union near a Soviet ICBM

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.700 align:middle line:84%
base, Intercontinental
Ballistic Missile Base,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.820 align:middle line:90%
in southeastern Soviet Union.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.380 align:middle line:90%
It's called Ceremchova.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.660 align:middle line:84%
A couple days earlier,
the Soviet radar

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.510 align:middle line:84%
picked up something
that was traveling

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.658 align:middle line:90%
from Siberia or southwest.

00:01:09.658 --> 00:01:11.200 align:middle line:84%
There were several
objects, actually,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.680 align:middle line:84%
that were tracked by
Soviet radar and also

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Soviet interceptors,
but they were never

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.830 align:middle line:84%
able to actually get close
enough to these two objects.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Sometime later, on the 12th,
an extraterrestrial craft

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.600 align:middle line:90%
landed near a Soviet ICBM base.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And the US intelligence service
had a control agency contact--

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.750 align:middle line:84%
we call them CACs, CAC--
but they were spies.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.720 align:middle line:84%
They were working for the
United States government.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And that spy reported back to
us this incident that occurred.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why'd they pick
this specific missile base?

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I don't know that the
Soviets knew or we figured out

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.370 align:middle line:84%
or our spy there on scene
figured out why, but--

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.470 align:middle line:90%
and we learned more later.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.110 align:middle line:84%
But at the time,
it landed, and it

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.720 align:middle line:84%
was confronted by Soviet
military and security

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.560 align:middle line:90%
personnel.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And occupants got
out of this craft,

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.710 align:middle line:84%
and the Soviet military
personnel engaged them.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:84%
One Soviet soldier fired an
AK-47 and shot one of the ETs.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.750 align:middle line:84%
The other three picked
up their wounded comrade

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle line:84%
and took him back
inside the craft.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.200 align:middle line:84%
As the craft was taking off,
Soviet military personnel

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.000 align:middle line:84%
fired at the craft, and the
craft ended up crashing.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.190 align:middle line:84%
But a beam of light
came out of the craft

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and hit a Soviet Jeep,
totally vaporizing the Jeep.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.700 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't anything
left of that Jeep,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:90%
according to our source.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.890 align:middle line:84%
So then the Soviet
military personnel,

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.340 align:middle line:84%
after the craft
crashed, they were

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.640 align:middle line:84%
able to open up the hatch
on the ET craft, the UFO,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and capture the four
entities, or four ETs,

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and take them into
their custody.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did
this craft look like,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.500 align:middle line:90%
and what did the ETs look like?

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The craft
was a circular shape,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.520 align:middle line:90%
about 30 feet in diameter.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.880 align:middle line:84%
It was described in meters,
but equivalent to 30

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.360 align:middle line:90%
feet in diameter.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.805 align:middle line:90%
It had a hatch on the bottom.

00:03:19.805 --> 00:03:22.670 align:middle line:84%
It had an oval shape
on top, oval shape

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.590 align:middle line:84%
on bottom, typical UFO
craft that people have seen.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.760 align:middle line:84%
There was a hatchet opened
with stairs coming out.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:90%
It was a matted gray in color.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:84%
The ETs were about 3
foot 5 inches tall.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.040 align:middle line:84%
They had on a tight fitting
gray suit, similar--

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:84%
they referred to it
as a gray flight suit.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.540 align:middle line:90%
They had longer arms, no thumbs.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:84%
They had-- and each had
helmets with a nozzle

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.570 align:middle line:84%
from the front to
the back, and they

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.420 align:middle line:84%
had a small tank in the
back, similar to something

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.402 align:middle line:84%
that they might be
having to breathe.

00:03:57.402 --> 00:03:59.110 align:middle line:84%
But they were taken
into custody and were

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.250 align:middle line:84%
taken to another Soviet
base some distance away.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.930 align:middle line:84%
The Soviets spent a
lot of time trying

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.800 align:middle line:84%
to interrogate these
entities by speaking Russian.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.300 align:middle line:84%
They used all sorts
of languages--

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Russian, English,
Spanish, Czech.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And these entities
wouldn't communicate

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.990 align:middle line:90%
or couldn't communicate.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.010 align:middle line:90%
They tried everything.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.510 align:middle line:84%
They sent some
linguists in from Moscow

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.030 align:middle line:84%
that spoke other
languages, but they

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.890 align:middle line:84%
couldn't communicate
at all using

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.780 align:middle line:84%
any of the different
various languages.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.020 align:middle line:84%
I think there were 11 or 12
different languages they used.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.900 align:middle line:84%
The Soviets didn't really
know what to do with them.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.220 align:middle line:84%
The one that they
had shot was dead.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:90%
It was dead.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.960 align:middle line:84%
The Soviet physicians
tried to revive it,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:84%
tried to care for it, but it--
they didn't know the anatomy.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.600 align:middle line:90%
It was really hopeless.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.370 align:middle line:84%
These entities were transported
to another facility,

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.750 align:middle line:84%
a detention center,
and housed there.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Four days later, these
entities disappeared.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.220 align:middle line:84%
The Soviet military
personnel that

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.790 align:middle line:84%
were guarding these entities
saw them in their cells

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.810 align:middle line:84%
in the detention
area, and then when

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.680 align:middle line:90%
they turned their backs, they--

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.980 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, the
entities disappeared.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.560 align:middle line:84%
They, of course, searched
for them, couldn't find them.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.250 align:middle line:84%
The entity's craft was at
another location some distance

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.550 align:middle line:90%
away, about 20 kilometers away.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So the Soviet personnel
went to that crash--

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.300 align:middle line:84%
the hangar housing this craft,
and that disappeared, too.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you elaborate
a little bit more--

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.450 align:middle line:84%
why they landed right there
at that particular point?

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: First of
all, let me explain.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.740 align:middle line:84%
The Soviet ICBM missiles
are not controlled

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.970 align:middle line:84%
like our ICBM missiles
are in the United States.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.220 align:middle line:84%
The Soviet military
personnel didn't

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:84%
have complete control over
every one of their missiles.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:84%
There had been a launch control
personnel at launch control

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.220 align:middle line:84%
facilities close to the missiles
in order to launch them,

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.110 align:middle line:84%
and some of these
missiles didn't have any

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.900 align:middle line:90%
launch control personnel there.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.300 align:middle line:84%
When the Soviets
went back, they found

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.200 align:middle line:84%
the hatches, the probably
20-ton hatches, removed.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.230 align:middle line:90%
So the Soviet ICBM was exposed.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And they found that
some of the missiles--

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:84%
I think there were
three of them--

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:84%
that had been
manipulated, or there's

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:34.090 align:middle line:84%
been some kind of either
an examination or some kind

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.140 align:middle line:84%
of tampering with a warhead
on top of the missiles.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.680 align:middle line:84%
The Soviets didn't realize
this until some weeks later.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.530 align:middle line:84%
They took it apart to figure
out why it wasn't working,

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.610 align:middle line:84%
and every single
operating component

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.710 align:middle line:84%
that would have caused a nuclear
detonation was all disabled.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh my goodness.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: In all three of them.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: In all of them.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And how someone or
something or some entity

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.640 align:middle line:84%
could do that without
actually going down and taking

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.030 align:middle line:84%
the missile apart, the
warhead apart to do that,

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.573 align:middle line:90%
is beyond explanation.

00:07:11.573 --> 00:07:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, it
looks like to me

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.640 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to give
us another message there.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, we know
from past experiences

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.810 align:middle line:84%
that they did the same
thing with our missile sites

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.820 align:middle line:84%
in Montana and South
Dakota and North Dakota.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what was the medical
examination on these beings?

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.540 align:middle line:84%
What was the morphology
that they found out?

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: The one that was--

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.530 align:middle line:84%
died, that was shot, was
examined very closely.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.030 align:middle line:90%
X-rays were taken.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.700 align:middle line:90%
Tissue samples were taken.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things they found out

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:50.160 align:middle line:84%
was the suit, or maybe the skin,
the outer texture of the ET,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.160 align:middle line:84%
the entity, was in
different layers.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.900 align:middle line:90%
So they had to cut through--

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.390 align:middle line:84%
the Soviet
pathologist had to cut

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.730 align:middle line:84%
through several
different layers.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And according to
our source, they

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.280 align:middle line:84%
weren't sure if they
were cutting through skin

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.610 align:middle line:84%
or whether it was texture
of some kind of a material.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.690 align:middle line:84%
But they took samples of
every one-- everything

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.850 align:middle line:90%
down to the actual organs.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And the organs
was one big organ,

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.760 align:middle line:84%
similar to what we
knew about the Ebens,

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:84%
which was one organ--
a heart-lung complex,

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:29.100 align:middle line:84%
something that would resemble
maybe a stomach or intestines,

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and they had white
fluid in their system

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:37.230 align:middle line:84%
rather than our red, or we've
seen entities with green fluid.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.590 align:middle line:90%
But it had white fluid.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:46.830 align:middle line:84%
The Soviet scientists or medical
personnel, pathologists--

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.180 align:middle line:90%
it was unknown to them.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:84%
One of the main things the
Soviet scientists wanted

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:55.570 align:middle line:84%
to know is, were these things
created, or were they--

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.470 align:middle line:84%
they were born like
our humans would be?

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Or were they grown
like clones or programmed life

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:06.510 align:middle line:84%
forms, or are they half
machine, half organic?

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.990 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you
mentioned all these layers

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.770 align:middle line:84%
before you get to the
organs is very interesting.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.710 align:middle line:84%
We've seen this in
the projects a lot.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yes, and I've seen it
when I worked for Association

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.810 align:middle line:90%
DARPA that they had layers.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And most of those with layers
were the part humanoid and part

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.120 align:middle line:84%
robot, and they weren't
the actual entities

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.090 align:middle line:84%
that were-- that had
flesh and blood like we

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.530 align:middle line:90%
would consider a human.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:40.870 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So were they able
to communicate ever

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:46.150 align:middle line:84%
with these
extraterrestrials, or it's

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:84%
just they were
unsuccessful with that?

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They never were
able to communicate.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.880 align:middle line:90%
They tried everything.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.180 align:middle line:90%
They even tried telepathy.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:59.830 align:middle line:84%
They had some psychic, a person
come in from a local institute

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:00.670 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.080 align:middle line:90%
And they weren't able to.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.530 align:middle line:84%
These entities would
just stand or sit

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:90%
and would be noncompliant.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.640 align:middle line:84%
The Soviet personnel would
give them instructions--

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.080 align:middle line:90%
sit down or--

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.190 align:middle line:90%
they were given food.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle line:84%
They were given water,
but the entities

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.712 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't touch the
food or the water.

00:10:18.712 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And were they
OK with this atmosphere?

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.975 align:middle line:84%
Did they take their
helmets off, leave them on?

00:10:22.975 --> 00:10:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: No, one of
the things that they

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.410 align:middle line:84%
didn't do, the Soviets didn't
take the entities' helmets off,

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.122 align:middle line:84%
because they
figured if they did,

00:10:30.122 --> 00:10:31.830 align:middle line:84%
it probably would kill
them, because they

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:32.883 align:middle line:90%
would have to breathe.

00:10:32.883 --> 00:10:34.800 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
they couldn't understand

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.430 align:middle line:84%
was the little tank in the
back was very, very small.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.320 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a large tank.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.090 align:middle line:90%
It was a very small tank.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And they survived several
days just on that small tank.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't
figure out what that was

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:53.910 align:middle line:84%
or if it was regenerating
itself inside the tank,

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:58.260 align:middle line:84%
like I talked about before,
where these certain entities

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.760 align:middle line:90%
could feed themselves.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And so they weren't sure if
that was something biological

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.490 align:middle line:90%
or it was mechanical.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.620 align:middle line:90%
But we never learned--

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.990 align:middle line:84%
we learned-- our
source was able to get

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.530 align:middle line:84%
us some photographs
of the entities

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.450 align:middle line:90%
and photographs of the craft.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you have
any videos or have

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.630 align:middle line:84%
seen videos of the
interrogation or of the craft?

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I personally
didn't, but I

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:30.200 align:middle line:84%
knew we had them, that our
US intelligence service had

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:90%
a copy of the video.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure
if the video was

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.920 align:middle line:84%
of an interrogation
of the entities

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.480 align:middle line:84%
or if it was the
actual incident.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they were--

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.470 align:middle line:84%
there were some pictures
of the actual incident.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I saw still pictures
of the craft

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:49.220 align:middle line:84%
on the ground and several Soviet
military vehicles around it.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.970 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't see anything
else other than that.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I mean, did you see
any rivets, or was it seamless?

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: No, there were
no seams, no rivets.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.970 align:middle line:84%
The Soviet personnel
went inside the craft,

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and the inside of the craft
was very, very simple.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.350 align:middle line:84%
There were places for
the entities to sit.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.980 align:middle line:84%
There were metal--
similar to metal chairs.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.640 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any knob, switches,
or buttons inside the craft.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.390 align:middle line:84%
There was a large monitor
in front of the seats.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:24.230 align:middle line:84%
There was a panel that
had similar to handprints,

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.920 align:middle line:84%
and that's it, as if the
entity sat in these chairs

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and put their hands in these
printed areas or grooves

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and maybe flew the
craft that way or maybe

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.780 align:middle line:90%
through their mind.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.850 align:middle line:84%
But there wasn't any other
rooms or compartments

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:38.650 align:middle line:90%
inside this craft.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's just
one big hollow space?

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes, one--

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, how many of these
areas with the palms and seats

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.560 align:middle line:90%
did you--

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.730 align:middle line:90%
did you see in the pictures?

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Four.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.433 align:middle line:84%
There was just four,
and there were four--

00:12:49.433 --> 00:12:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Four of them.

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.392 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: --entities, yeah.

00:12:51.392 --> 00:12:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: On the panels, you
know, we have five fingers.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Were there any
digits that looked

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:84%
like that's where they
put their hands into?

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Just four.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.390 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have thumbs.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: OK, so there
was four digits.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:05.913 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Four digits.

00:13:05.913 --> 00:13:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Four grooves.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Four grooves.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Four grooves.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And the only thing
other than that were--

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:21.430 align:middle line:84%
there were metal rods that ran
from the ceiling of the craft

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:22.900 align:middle line:90%
down to the back of the chair.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Each chair had this
metal bar running--

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.150 align:middle line:90%
some kind of a bar.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.020 align:middle line:90%
It was ironic.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:37.270 align:middle line:84%
It was very-- our analysts
emphasized the fact that there

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:42.340 align:middle line:84%
wasn't any other rooms, little
galley ways inside this craft.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.990 align:middle line:90%
It was all one big area.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of our
scientists, later on,

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.810 align:middle line:84%
surmised that once it
was on the ground, that's

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.310 align:middle line:90%
what we would see.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.970 align:middle line:84%
But once it flew, these
walls could be fluid

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.440 align:middle line:90%
and could change shapes.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.890 align:middle line:84%
We actually saw this
in a captured craft

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.560 align:middle line:84%
that we recovered
in Nevada years

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:11.260 align:middle line:84%
ago that once that was powered
up, things inside that craft

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.970 align:middle line:90%
changed appearances.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they think that--

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:16.542 align:middle line:90%
what occurred.

00:14:16.542 --> 00:14:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you learn anything
about the propulsion system

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.327 align:middle line:90%
on this craft?

00:14:20.327 --> 00:14:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes, we did.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:28.600 align:middle line:84%
The Soviets had drew a
picture of the craft, artist's

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.460 align:middle line:90%
conception of the craft.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And what they found
under the craft

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:39.040 align:middle line:84%
was these three round
containers, ball containers.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And according to the Soviet
scientists and, later on,

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.840 align:middle line:84%
the analysis done
by our scientists,

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.170 align:middle line:84%
there were positive
ion and negative ion

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:55.360 align:middle line:84%
pods with a third
container that probably--

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.410 align:middle line:84%
and this is probably
theorizing--

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:02.470 align:middle line:84%
where both positive and negative
ions would be placed in there,

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.320 align:middle line:84%
which would cause the
propulsion system.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.670 align:middle line:84%
So they figured it was some
type of ion propulsion system,

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:11.620 align:middle line:90%
a positive and negative.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:15.112 align:middle line:84%
And that's all I
was ever briefed on.

00:15:15.112 --> 00:15:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they
ever say anything

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:22.420 align:middle line:84%
about the craft making any noise
or the beings making any noise?

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: As I said earlier, there
was some additional information

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.510 align:middle line:90%
that was obtained later.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:36.150 align:middle line:84%
On January 11, the day before,
a small village some distance

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.580 align:middle line:84%
from Ceremchova,
there was an incident

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.800 align:middle line:84%
that happened where
this craft landed,

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and these entities
got out and had

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.810 align:middle line:84%
to interface with
some local villagers

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:48.020 align:middle line:90%
near a collective farm.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
lot of interface,

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and these Soviet citizens
were able to form

00:15:55.950 --> 00:16:00.300 align:middle line:84%
some kind of communications
with these entities, probably

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.130 align:middle line:90%
through telepathy.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:84%
When after this craft
had left or disappeared,

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:08.880 align:middle line:84%
the Soviet KGB started
interviewing people

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.600 align:middle line:84%
and found this village, and
it was some distance away--

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.322 align:middle line:84%
50 kilometers maybe,
something like that.

00:16:15.322 --> 00:16:17.030 align:middle line:84%
They found these
people, and these people

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.580 align:middle line:84%
said, oh, we spoke
to these people

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.680 align:middle line:90%
from outer space, outer space--

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:84%
I think they call
them outer space men.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they elaborate
of what was spoken?

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Would they speak about
what was the conversation?

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:34.700 align:middle line:84%
The entities wanted
to know who they were

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.410 align:middle line:90%
and what their jobs were.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.930 align:middle line:90%
What were they doing?

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And these people worked
on a collective farm

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:42.350 align:middle line:90%
in Soviet Union.

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.670 align:middle line:90%
They were farmers.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And everybody worked at one--
for one mission in Soviet Union

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:49.490 align:middle line:90%
during that time.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:51.300 align:middle line:90%
They were collective farmers.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to
explain that to these entities.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And they were
talking in Russian.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.560 align:middle line:84%
The entities were
speaking in some language

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.910 align:middle line:90%
they couldn't understand.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:05.510 align:middle line:84%
But these farmers could
understand everything

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:06.380 align:middle line:90%
in their mind.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.540 align:middle line:84%
It confused them at
first, because they

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.780 align:middle line:84%
were hearing voices in their
mind from these entities.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't relate
initially that the entities

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:17.300 align:middle line:90%
were sending these.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, they figured it
all out, and they had a long--

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:90%
I think an hour or so--

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:25.520 align:middle line:90%
time with these entities.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.859 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, they
were asking questions, too--

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:90%
where you came from.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:33.180 align:middle line:84%
The entities were trying to
explain where they came from,

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.040 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't know how
to do it in our language.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.310 align:middle line:84%
They were giving
numbers of star groups

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and number of planets
within the star group.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, these collective farmers
were not educated in astronomy,

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.920 align:middle line:90%
so they didn't understand this.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.100 align:middle line:84%
They told the KGB, and later,
there were scientists that came

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.880 align:middle line:84%
in and spoke-- brought these
witnesses in and tried to have

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.930 align:middle line:90%
them draw charts and--

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But still, there
wasn't any information

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:03.200 align:middle line:84%
coming from them
to exactly pinpoint

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.020 align:middle line:84%
where these entities
were coming from.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I believe,
even today, it

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.830 align:middle line:84%
would be hard for
us to understand

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:13.045 align:middle line:84%
that mapping of where
someone comes from in space.

00:18:13.045 --> 00:18:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Exactly,
because they had

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:84%
their own astronomy, their
own physics, their own math.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:18.980 align:middle line:90%
And here we are.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.240 align:middle line:90%
We had our own.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.532 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
their system is.

00:18:22.532 --> 00:18:23.990 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
what our system is.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:84%
It would be very
difficult to try

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:29.180 align:middle line:84%
to explain a certain
place in a certain galaxy

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:33.200 align:middle line:84%
or a certain star system
that they came from to us.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it would be very difficult.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do we know today what
kind of extraterrestrial beings

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:38.930 align:middle line:90%
they are?

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, our intelligence
analysts, getting together

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.250 align:middle line:84%
with scientists
who had knowledge

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:50.240 align:middle line:84%
of the UFO and the
extraterrestrial races,

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.150 align:middle line:84%
came to a conclusion-- and this
isn't coming from the Soviets.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:54.740 align:middle line:90%
This is coming from our people--

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:55.940 align:middle line:90%
that they were the Ebens.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.597 align:middle line:84%
They came from Zeta
Reticuli star group.

00:18:58.597 --> 00:19:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do you
personally think,

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.870 align:middle line:90%
Rick, about this final report?

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, I believe
everything in the report.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.130 align:middle line:90%
It's an official report.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:10.580 align:middle line:84%
It came from a well-placed
control agency contact

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:17.270 align:middle line:84%
inside the Soviet military that
had provided countless accurate

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:90%
intelligence in the past.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And what's ironic
was some years later,

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:26.440 align:middle line:84%
one of the KGB officers that
interviewed the witnesses--

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.090 align:middle line:84%
now, he wasn't at the
scene of the incident,

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:32.510 align:middle line:84%
but he was the one that
interviewed the witnesses--

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:35.720 align:middle line:84%
immigrated to the United
States and came out

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.360 align:middle line:90%
at one of the UFO conventions.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, his recollection is
coming from the Soviets,

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.950 align:middle line:84%
and so the actual
chain of events

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:49.130 align:middle line:84%
is a lot different
from his point of view

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.620 align:middle line:84%
than from the
intelligence report

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.470 align:middle line:84%
that I had read, an intelligence
report that is online.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a different viewpoint.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.660 align:middle line:84%
But it all says
basically the same thing.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, I heard something
from one of my people--

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.660 align:middle line:90%
maybe you can verify this--

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:09.110 align:middle line:84%
that when the craft
landed in this village,

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:15.980 align:middle line:84%
it left markings in the foliage
or the ground or something.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And see if you could
talk about that, and was

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.960 align:middle line:84%
there anything exchanged between
the villagers and the ETs?

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Well, the landing did--

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:30.600 align:middle line:84%
when the craft landed, there
wasn't anything on the ground.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:35.270 align:middle line:84%
But when the craft
left, the villagers

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.890 align:middle line:84%
felt these entities
were friendly.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:39.290 align:middle line:90%
They were friends.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:40.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they didn't--

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:44.340 align:middle line:84%
they tried-- the villagers tried
to exchange bread and salt,

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.180 align:middle line:84%
which is a custom of the
Soviet Union of friendship,

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:51.120 align:middle line:84%
exchanging bread and
salt. They took--

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.530 align:middle line:90%
the entities took the bread.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:54.900 align:middle line:84%
They weren't-- they didn't
take the salt. Funny,

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.300 align:middle line:84%
they maybe didn't know what
it was or I don't know.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They had high
blood pressure, probably.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.092 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Maybe they had
high blood pressure.

00:21:02.092 --> 00:21:06.900 align:middle line:84%
But the entities did
give the villagers

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.500 align:middle line:84%
these two long, almost
looking like cigars,

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.010 align:middle line:84%
but they're metal-shaped,
similar to looking

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.900 align:middle line:84%
like a cigar, but
they were metal.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And they gave two of
them, one to each--

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.390 align:middle line:84%
the two main villagers that
they spoke with, they gave them.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the craft
left, there was

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.020 align:middle line:84%
a light that came out that
left a design in the ground.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.110 align:middle line:84%
You're right-- in the ground
area, similar to a crop circle.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And I heard there's people
and scientists still

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.790 align:middle line:84%
to this day going over
there, and there's not

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:42.280 align:middle line:90%
much growth in that area.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And they've taken
lots of samples,

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and people pick the flowers
there and keep them,

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and they have some sort of
connection with this area.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: When the KGB went there
to interview these people,

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.500 align:middle line:84%
they saw this
design on the ground

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and asked the villagers,
who made this?

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, our space friends made it.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they did a lot
of analysis of the ground

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:07.882 align:middle line:90%
that they took pictures.

00:22:07.882 --> 00:22:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I think they went up
in the air with a helicopter

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and took a picture
of it, of the design,

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.040 align:middle line:84%
and tried to figure
out what it meant.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And the Soviet personnel,
Soviet scientists,

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:22.820 align:middle line:84%
figured it was their galaxy
or their solar system or star

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:23.620 align:middle line:90%
group.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Like a
map or something.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, some
sort of a map.

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:28.390 align:middle line:90%
And for years-- and there was--

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.640 align:middle line:84%
that was on the internet for
a long time, that design.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.773 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if anybody
ever figured it out.

00:22:33.773 --> 00:22:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, right.

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And those objects that,
of course, the KGB took them.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, I was going to ask.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: And I don't know--

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.140 align:middle line:84%
he didn't know what
ever happened to them.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.670 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know what they were.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:46.090 align:middle line:84%
But some of the American
scientists analyzing it

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.505 align:middle line:84%
figured it was some
sort of a translator.

00:22:48.505 --> 00:22:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, many
people believe

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.760 align:middle line:84%
all these small craft
that do come to the planet

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:57.860 align:middle line:84%
are actually pods from larger
craft that are in space.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:58.965 align:middle line:90%
What's your take on that?

00:22:58.965 --> 00:23:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah, I believe it.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:03.500 align:middle line:90%
I believe that that's the fact.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And I've had access to
information that says

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.010 align:middle line:90%
that these interplanetary--

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:13.970 align:middle line:84%
these crafts are coming into
Earth's atmosphere and landing

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and exploring
Earth's atmosphere is

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:22.660 align:middle line:84%
coming from a larger or a mother
ship, because it's so small.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.540 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult for us
to conceive-- of course,

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:28.180 align:middle line:90%
we're thinking of our science--

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:32.410 align:middle line:84%
that this craft could
leave our atmosphere--

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.510 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Traverse the whole--

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --transverse
thousands and hundreds

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:38.540 align:middle line:90%
or light years or so forth.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually
pictures taken by NASA,

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.410 align:middle line:84%
the two of them that
used to be on internet,

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:50.800 align:middle line:84%
of these huge objects sitting
out there and orbiting

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:55.270 align:middle line:84%
beyond Earth and that were
probably the mother ships.

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it possible,
Rick, in your opinion,

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:04.000 align:middle line:84%
that maybe the ETs didn't
dematerialize into their craft

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.700 align:middle line:84%
and took off, but
maybe the mother ship

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:11.890 align:middle line:84%
dematerialized the beings
and the craft and took them?

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: That's very possible.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.600 align:middle line:84%
That was not something I
had heard or read about,

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.640 align:middle line:90%
but that's very possible.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, these entities
dematerialized.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:30.025 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't know if it's
like the Starship Enterprise--

00:24:30.025 --> 00:24:32.920 align:middle line:84%
beam me up, Scotty--
but somehow,

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure if they're
50,000 years ahead of us

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.760 align:middle line:84%
in technology, they
might have the science

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.690 align:middle line:84%
to do that, to dematerialize
and rematerialize

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.580 align:middle line:90%
inside their ship.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.840 align:middle line:84%
But something that,
later on, I learned

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.020 align:middle line:84%
working with the Institute
for Advanced Studies,

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:57.460 align:middle line:84%
is the theory about
these ships and about

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.860 align:middle line:84%
the material that
the ship's made of

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:04.010 align:middle line:84%
and how they can form
and reform shapes,

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.100 align:middle line:90%
and there's some pictures--

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.830 align:middle line:84%
there was a video, classic
video taken some years

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:14.920 align:middle line:84%
ago by an aircraft, a
fighter jet, a bombsite video

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.410 align:middle line:90%
of a craft that it was chasing.

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was a saucer-shaped
craft, but as it got--

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and this was over
the Netherlands--

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:30.150 align:middle line:84%
as it got close to this craft,
it changed into a box and spun,

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:35.230 align:middle line:84%
totally confusing the pilot and
making him bank away, thinking,

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:36.030 align:middle line:90%
what--

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.200 align:middle line:90%
scaring him, almost.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.430 align:middle line:90%
Like, what is that?

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:40.230 align:middle line:90%
What-- that just happened.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:44.700 align:middle line:84%
But there's theories--
theoretical physicists created

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:49.770 align:middle line:84%
theories about how metal can
change, how objects can change,

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:51.870 align:middle line:84%
and that we even have
the technology now

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:53.340 align:middle line:90%
of doing some of that.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.007 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where do you
think these mother

00:25:55.007 --> 00:25:59.010 align:middle line:84%
ships may be parked in orbit
or beyond Earth's orbit?

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, I know I've seen
photographs from the National

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Reconnaissance Office,
NRO, and some of them

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.650 align:middle line:84%
were on the internet
some years ago,

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and a man gave a presentation
at a UFO convention

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:13.530 align:middle line:84%
showing these
photographs, that they're

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.360 align:middle line:84%
parked outside of the
Earth's atmosphere.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.540 align:middle line:84%
They're just hanging
out there, so to speak,

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.280 align:middle line:90%
and they're huge crafts.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're thousands
of feet long and high,

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.820 align:middle line:84%
and they are just
sitting out there.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
hovering out there,

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:32.935 align:middle line:84%
and so it wouldn't take much
to have a craft visiting Earth,

00:26:32.935 --> 00:26:34.560 align:middle line:84%
a small-- one of
these smaller crafts--

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:38.160 align:middle line:84%
to have enough
propulsion and technology

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.760 align:middle line:84%
to get to the mother ship,
which would take them in.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And then the mother
ship would be the ones

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.360 align:middle line:90%
that would fly to the planet.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's also rumors that
they could be on a base,

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.330 align:middle line:90%
on the moon, or on Mars.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.220 align:middle line:84%
There have been
remote viewers that

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.100 align:middle line:84%
can remote view
objects that were

00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:01.320 align:middle line:84%
real close to the moon of
Mars, that this object is just

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.230 align:middle line:90%
parked out there.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:03.030 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's probably
the mother ship.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Would you
characterize this

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.150 align:middle line:84%
as a voluntary
event or exchange?

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: I would.

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:12.200 align:middle line:90%
I would.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.520 align:middle line:84%
They initially made
friends with villagers.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They landed and made
a friend with the villagers.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:23.660 align:middle line:84%
They obviously had a mission
to disable three Soviet ICBMs

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.280 align:middle line:90%
for a particular reason.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we can't get in
the head of these entities

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:29.430 align:middle line:90%
to figure out why.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.130 align:middle line:84%
But, you know,
probably common sense

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:33.980 align:middle line:84%
would tell me that they
wanted to leave a message.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Listen, earthlings, we
don't like these ICBMs' just

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:44.600 align:middle line:84%
chance of destroying
the atmosphere and even

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:49.680 align:middle line:84%
maybe the solar system, harming
the universe in some way.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And so we want to
leave a message to you

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:56.180 align:middle line:84%
that we're capable of disabling
these things, if we really

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:57.020 align:middle line:90%
want to.

00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And we are capable of stopping
any wars before it started.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's my personal opinion,
and I'm not the only one.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:08.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a lot of people
within the government and even

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:09.950 align:middle line:84%
within the
intelligence community

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:11.277 align:middle line:90%
that think the same way.

00:28:11.277 --> 00:28:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:13.820 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, great intel on
the Soviet Union, Rick.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:18.440 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
you being on the show.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Thanks, Emery.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.530 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be on the show.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:25.250 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
