00:00:19.537 --> 00:00:21.370 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.040 align:middle line:10%
we are with Randy Cramer
who has interacted

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.610 align:middle line:10%
with different humanoid ET races
during his time serving off

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.480 align:middle line:10%
planet.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.797 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:29.797 --> 00:00:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY CRAMER: Thanks
for having me, Emery.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How many different
ETs have you actually

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:90%
interacted with, humanoid?

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well that's a
very specific question then.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.720 align:middle line:84%
So probably, one of the coolest,
most amazing things that I've

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.820 align:middle line:84%
been fortunate to
be able to do was

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.370 align:middle line:84%
when I was a pilot
aboard the Nautilus,

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle line:84%
we would occasionally
have groups

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:84%
of ambassadors from the
ambassadorial corps who

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:84%
would come aboard the ship,
who would be-- we'd basically

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.450 align:middle line:84%
be escorting to the
intergalactic space

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.400 align:middle line:90%
station that orbits Jupiter.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Because I was essentially
the only officer that

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.610 align:middle line:84%
had infantry training,
I got to go along

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.580 align:middle line:84%
on these missions as
that just-in-case guy.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.040 align:middle line:84%
But I want to emphasize
that these were missions

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:90%
to a location which there was--

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.690 align:middle line:84%
this wasn't like an alien bar
where a fight might break out.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.610 align:middle line:84%
This was a very regulated
community environment

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.130 align:middle line:84%
where a number of species
would get together and be

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.520 align:middle line:84%
able to have these
conversations.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.640 align:middle line:84%
So my, quote unquote,
"just-in-case"

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.230 align:middle line:90%
was never required.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.420 align:middle line:90%
But I still got to go along.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And the main room
inside the space station

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.850 align:middle line:84%
is probably almost a
mile around with floor

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.120 align:middle line:84%
to ceiling windows that
probably go 70 or 80 feet high

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.310 align:middle line:90%
in a full 360.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Because to accommodate
the variety of species

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.760 align:middle line:84%
that might come there
to have a conversation,

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.350 align:middle line:84%
the facility uses hard light
holographic generators.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So the difference between
a soft light hologram

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and a hard light
hologram is you can

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:90%
sit on a hard light hologram.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:84%
You can't sit on the
soft light hologram.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.680 align:middle line:84%
So they would create
conversational environments,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.990 align:middle line:84%
which the basic
conversational environment--

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.920 align:middle line:84%
a table with chairs
on either side,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.290 align:middle line:90%
if that's all that's required.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Depending on the
species interacting

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.880 align:middle line:84%
with each other, height
differences, liquid environment

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.540 align:middle line:84%
or gaseous environment
differences,

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.710 align:middle line:84%
whether they're wearing an
environment suit or not,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.750 align:middle line:84%
all these conversational
environments

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.820 align:middle line:84%
could be created
impromptu, and then

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:84%
deleted as quickly as
they were turned on.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Because it's just computer
code essentially making

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.110 align:middle line:90%
these hard light holograms.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And the room, I would
say, all the time

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:84%
was anywhere from half,
2/3 full, to full.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:90%
So it was a very busy place.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And the smallest species I
ever encountered in this room

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.650 align:middle line:90%
was about 18 inches high.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.410 align:middle line:84%
The tallest species I ever
encountered in this room was

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:09.040 align:middle line:84%
over 50 feet high, as well as
a wide variety of humanoid,

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.640 align:middle line:90%
non-humanoid--

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.750 align:middle line:84%
again, cephalopods,
amphibians, species

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.930 align:middle line:84%
based on just about
every kind of life

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:84%
form that you can think
of in an evolved state.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.180 align:middle line:84%
So in that environment, I
would say that I personally

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.590 align:middle line:84%
sat across the table from a
few dozen different species.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.710 align:middle line:84%
But I'd say I was within 15
yards during that time of what

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.150 align:middle line:84%
would have to be
hundreds of species.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.977 align:middle line:90%
So that's a loaded question.

00:03:42.977 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:84%
But I guess the question you
asked was humanoid species.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So humanoid species,
I'd say, would

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.360 align:middle line:84%
be maybe only half a
dozen or so half a dozen,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.750 align:middle line:90%
less than a dozen.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were they more
conscious and intelligent

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.090 align:middle line:90%
than we are?

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I'd say you
had a range of comparable

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.640 align:middle line:84%
to maybe a little bit more
developed along the path

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.440 align:middle line:90%
than we are.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:84%
But to be honest,
there were more

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.480 align:middle line:84%
that I would say were
comparable than I would

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:90%
say we're way more developed.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a presumption
that other species are

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.190 align:middle line:84%
so much more advanced because
they have space travel.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to emphasize
that's not necessarily true.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Space technology,
spaceships do not

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.840 align:middle line:84%
guarantee that you're the
smartest species on the block.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Because not everybody gets
their spaceship technology

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.850 align:middle line:90%
by inventing it themselves.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.780 align:middle line:90%
They get it from someplace else.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.330 align:middle line:84%
We got our technology
from someplace else.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.773 align:middle line:84%
So it's a pretty wide variation,
to be honest with you.

00:04:44.773 --> 00:04:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Glad you
brought that up.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Because there is this big
misconception out there that,

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.300 align:middle line:90%
oh, they're ETs.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.230 align:middle line:84%
They're like the
superheroes of the galaxy.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.270 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Not at all.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's basically us,
you know, in the future.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.425 align:middle line:90%
But we're still us in a way.

00:05:01.425 --> 00:05:02.300 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.921 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You know what
I'm trying to say here.

00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yes.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: A lot of
times, I was surprised.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Because I was like, I think
you just mispronounced a word.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe he's telepathically
not communicating correctly.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.530 align:middle line:84%
But everyone makes
mistakes, especially when

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:19.610 align:middle line:90%
you enter this dimension.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.818 align:middle line:84%
You fall under the
laws of this dimension.

00:05:21.818 --> 00:05:23.360 align:middle line:84%
You said there's
thousands of species

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.575 align:middle line:90%
and different types of forms.

00:05:24.575 --> 00:05:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, yeah.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were you
able to communicate

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.980 align:middle line:90%
with the other species there?

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.280 align:middle line:84%
So again, they're creating
conversational environments.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And so depending on the
language barrier or not,

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.180 align:middle line:84%
you could have a
variety of translation.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.980 align:middle line:84%
So in some cases, you have
an actual, biological being

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.710 align:middle line:90%
acting as a verbal translator.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.750 align:middle line:84%
You may have a physical
biological being

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.000 align:middle line:90%
acting as a psionic translator.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.930 align:middle line:84%
There is essentially like a
computer universal translator,

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.520 align:middle line:84%
like a box that
sits on the table.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So you talk and the box
translates to their language.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.850 align:middle line:84%
They talk and the box
translates to English.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.430 align:middle line:84%
There was also a
little halo that you

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.550 align:middle line:84%
could wear that was like
a psionic communicator.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.890 align:middle line:84%
If the other species in
question was psionically

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.590 align:middle line:84%
developed enough, they could
carry the whole conversation.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And you'd be able to engage
in a psionic conversation

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.885 align:middle line:84%
without any
additional apparatus.

00:06:17.885 --> 00:06:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what was the nature
of this interaction of you guys

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.820 align:middle line:90%
going to this space station?

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.118 align:middle line:90%
What was the agenda there?

00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Anywhere
from what we would

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.590 align:middle line:84%
call an initial conversation
with another species, where

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.810 align:middle line:84%
maybe we've just
met and it's time

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.850 align:middle line:84%
for their ambassadors
and our ambassadors

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.708 align:middle line:84%
to sit down and say,
oh, where are you from?

00:06:37.708 --> 00:06:38.750 align:middle line:90%
This is where we're from.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.820 align:middle line:90%
This is what our planet's like.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.820 align:middle line:90%
What's your planet like?

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.537 align:middle line:84%
And it's as much
of a conversation

00:06:42.537 --> 00:06:44.120 align:middle line:84%
that you might just
have with somebody

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.480 align:middle line:84%
you met from another country
and want to know about, oh,

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.800 align:middle line:90%
what do you like to eat?

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And what do you guys
like to listen to?

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:90%
And what's your art like?

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.440 align:middle line:90%
What's your history like?

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.750 align:middle line:90%
What's your politics like?

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.040 align:middle line:90%
What's your economy like?

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:84%
What are your items
that you trade

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.320 align:middle line:84%
that you have excess trade
items that you would want

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:90%
to give to us or trade with us?

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.560 align:middle line:84%
What do you need
that you don't have

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:90%
a lot of that we might have?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
initial conversations.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:15.080 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, we could
develop into initial treaty

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.250 align:middle line:90%
and contract negotiations.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.290 align:middle line:90%
So it could be a treaty.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be a
real contract where

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.530 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about we've
got this much in rare Earth

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.690 align:middle line:84%
elements or military hardware
or beer or garments or clothing.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.290 align:middle line:84%
They've got x amount
in minerals or elements

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:38.007 align:middle line:90%
or technology or food or drink.

00:07:38.007 --> 00:07:40.340 align:middle line:84%
To be honest though, we make
better beer than just about

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.670 align:middle line:90%
anybody else in the galaxy.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I was going to ask you.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Why the beer?

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.380 align:middle line:90%
You said clothes.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.247 align:middle line:90%
You said beer.

00:07:47.247 --> 00:07:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, the
first thing that's

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:54.230 align:middle line:84%
important to know about that is
we didn't invent beer, right?

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So as our history tells
us, ancient gods brought,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:84%
you know, fermentation
and beer making to us.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And as we know, when
you say ancient god,

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.500 align:middle line:84%
you're really just saying
extraterrestrial astronaut

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.010 align:middle line:90%
from somewhere else.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.420 align:middle line:84%
So extraterrestrials
brought us fermentation,

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:16.000 align:middle line:84%
brought us beer and wine
and spirits technology.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is the thing,
I think, again that

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.860 align:middle line:90%
escapes a lot of people.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.500 align:middle line:84%
When they presume that
all of these other species

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.630 align:middle line:84%
are so much more advanced
and they make better

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.720 align:middle line:84%
stuff than we do, but
they just don't understand

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.880 align:middle line:90%
the human creativity component.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.710 align:middle line:84%
There are species
who make something.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.205 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know, if it
ain't broke, don't fix it.

00:08:35.205 --> 00:08:36.830 align:middle line:84%
They're a species
who are flying around

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.440 align:middle line:84%
in spacecraft that are
the exact same Model

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.200 align:middle line:84%
T, Model A, that they've
been flying around

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.540 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.170 align:middle line:84%
As a species, this is
actually fairly rare.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:90%
We make something.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And within five minutes, we're
thinking about, OK, next one,

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:52.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to improve this.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to make this better.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:54.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to make that better.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:59.590 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out, over the
centuries or millennia,

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.890 align:middle line:84%
we have taken a viewpoint
on fermentation in beer

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.355 align:middle line:84%
making that's just always
wanting to make it better,

00:09:05.355 --> 00:09:06.730 align:middle line:84%
always wanting to
make it better,

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.390 align:middle line:84%
always wanting to
make it better.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So we have refined
that process in a way

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.423 align:middle line:84%
that is far beyond
the sophistication

00:09:14.423 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:90%
of many other species.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Because they're just like,
eh, it's good enough.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.280 align:middle line:90%
It's mead.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.600 align:middle line:90%
We're good enough.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.900 align:middle line:84%
So it just turns out
that we make better beer.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's more common
than not, as I found out,

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:32.530 align:middle line:84%
for various biologies
that, in some cases,

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.220 align:middle line:90%
can be very different than ours.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.450 align:middle line:84%
But they still react to alcohol
in very much the same way

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.840 align:middle line:84%
or, in some cases,
some other compounds

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.020 align:middle line:84%
that we might think of ingesting
or smoking or whatever.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.050 align:middle line:84%
We might think, those
things, most of the time,

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.880 align:middle line:84%
where we got them was
from another species

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.850 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.370 align:middle line:84%
So there's another
species out there

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.730 align:middle line:84%
that likes to drink and smoke
weed and do whatever else.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:84%
So it just turns out that we
make really good beer compared

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:90%
to what else is out there.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.980 align:middle line:90%
So they love it.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So it's strictly
just for entertainment?

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: They like to
relax and have a drink, too.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there some sort of
Galactic Parliament or Galactic

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Federation that you're
aware of out there?

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: There's a number
of entities and organizations

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:84%
that coalesce for
different reasons.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:25.030 align:middle line:84%
So my understanding is there
is an Intergalactic Council.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's an
Intergalactic Senate,

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.060 align:middle line:90%
which is a voluntary process.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.550 align:middle line:84%
So worlds that participate,
it's a voluntary thing.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.670 align:middle line:90%
There's no forced participation.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of their
policy decisions

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.820 align:middle line:90%
are also not forced decisions.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.150 align:middle line:90%
They make policy decisions.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.590 align:middle line:84%
They say, hey, we talked
about this amongst ourselves

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.370 align:middle line:90%
for the last decade or so.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.400 align:middle line:84%
We've come up with
a policy idea.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And then whoever is
cooperating with that body

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.210 align:middle line:84%
can decide whether they want to
implement that policy or not.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you think politics
here on Earth is complicated

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and a bit of a mess,
intergalactic politics

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.520 align:middle line:90%
is even messier in some cases.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.430 align:middle line:84%
But you know,
democracy is messy.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you have dictatorial
forces, small groups of people

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.590 align:middle line:84%
dominating what everybody else
does, that may simplify things.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.580 align:middle line:84%
But it usually doesn't
make things better.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.090 align:middle line:84%
What we often find even in
the intergalactic community

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.770 align:middle line:84%
is that when everybody
gets together

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.170 align:middle line:84%
to make democratic decisions,
things just go better.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:28.180 align:middle line:84%
But democracy is
not clean sometimes.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:28.980 align:middle line:90%
It's messy.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:29.980 align:middle line:90%
People got to to debate.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.110 align:middle line:90%
People got to argue.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.990 align:middle line:90%
I want this.

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.930 align:middle line:90%
But I don't want that.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
you to have that.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.280 align:middle line:90%
But I need this.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And that back and
forth can go on

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:84%
for quite a while
before people come up

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.787 align:middle line:84%
with an agreement of some kind
that they can all live with.

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you ever had
a personal relationship

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.380 align:middle line:90%
with an ET?

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Define
personal relationship.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, let's just
say, have you ever dated one

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:57.080 align:middle line:84%
or, you know, was involved that
way, in a caring, loving way?

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.217 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yes.

00:11:59.217 --> 00:12:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And what was that like?

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.230 align:middle line:90%


00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, she
was a humanoid species

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.870 align:middle line:90%
in this Cassiopeian system.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.810 align:middle line:84%
They look very,
very much like us.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Their eyes are basically
the main difference.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.610 align:middle line:84%
So we have a circle
within a circle.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.880 align:middle line:84%
They have a swirl
within a circle.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Their language is
a little different.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.380 align:middle line:84%
They kind of vibrate their
sinus cavities when they talk.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking sort
of about the vibration

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.190 align:middle line:90%
of different air pockets.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And that was something
that they did.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:32.950 align:middle line:90%
Her name was Neha.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And her father was
a high value target

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.710 align:middle line:84%
that we had to pull off of
one of their colony worlds

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.650 align:middle line:84%
that were being aggressed upon
and managed to bring him back.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was given permission
by my base commander

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.460 align:middle line:84%
when we got back onto the
ground to escort him home.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And his family was so
thrilled to see him

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to treat me to dinner
and have me over and so forth

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and actually became very
good friends with his family.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And his daughter and I
became romantically involved.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.170 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, it was fabulous.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:04.450 align:middle line:90%
I miss her.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.843 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: How does that work?

00:13:05.843 --> 00:13:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, I mean we're
very biologically compatible.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Very.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: So that's
how that works.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.850 align:middle line:90%
Very biologically compatible.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I talk
a lot about that.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And you probably elaborate, too,
of the intermingling of species

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:90%
in the galaxy is crazy.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, so yeah.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.230 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's one of those things
that I hadn't thought about

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and hadn't really
crossed my mind.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.020 align:middle line:84%
But the more time I spent
with this ambassadorial team

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and the more species we met,
the more the conversations

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.650 align:middle line:90%
came up about compatibility.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's two different
kinds of compatibility.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.170 align:middle line:84%
There is biological,
child-bearing compatibility,

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.030 align:middle line:84%
the ability to interact
sexually and have a child.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.870 align:middle line:84%
There is also just
the compatibility

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.870 align:middle line:84%
that your part connects to my
part and it feels good part.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
that relationship

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.870 align:middle line:90%
and that connection--

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:07.160 align:middle line:84%
a lot of species are able to
connect their parts together.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
else to say that.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's the
best way to put it.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Did you add and Neha or
any other extraterrestrial

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.602 align:middle line:90%
ever have a child?

00:14:18.602 --> 00:14:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yes, we have a son.

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And does he look
like the both of you?

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Unfortunately,
I had to leave there

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:90%
while he was still an infant.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.067 align:middle line:84%
So I honestly don't know
what he looks like right now.

00:14:31.067 --> 00:14:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure how
much he looks like me

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.032 align:middle line:90%
or how much he looks like her.

00:14:34.032 --> 00:14:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how would
he fit into society

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.270 align:middle line:90%
there if he's half human?

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I think they have a
pretty open-minded stance when

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:44.200 align:middle line:84%
it comes to social issues
and interaction issues.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.910 align:middle line:84%
So her family love
the crap out of me.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:52.863 align:middle line:84%
And their extended family, you
know, was very fond and very

00:14:52.863 --> 00:14:55.030 align:middle line:84%
friendly to me and treated
me like one of their own,

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.890 align:middle line:84%
invited me into their family
like one of their own.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.530 align:middle line:84%
It was quite wonderful,
to be honest with you.

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So it was not a forbidden
relationship on their end

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.020 align:middle line:90%
or on our end.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.620 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't the only Terran
soldier on that planet

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.010 align:middle line:84%
who ended up with a girlfriend
or a boyfriend and ended up,

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.750 align:middle line:90%
you know, making a hybrid baby.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So there were a few
that we left behind.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.070 align:middle line:90%
There were some inquiries.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.570 align:middle line:84%
There was an inquiry
before I left.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't like a you
did something wrong inquiry.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:84%
It was more like we need
more data and information

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.630 align:middle line:90%
kind of a thing.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I mean, I
would imagine he's

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:34.360 align:middle line:84%
going to grow up being
accepted, not just accepted.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.990 align:middle line:84%
But to be honest,
I think he's going

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:84%
to be seen as having unique
qualities and unique features.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Because he's going to
have, you know, my DNA.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And so again, this
is a culture that

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.350 align:middle line:84%
really likes to take
the best of a person

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:49.973 align:middle line:84%
and find the best place for
them to be in their society.

00:15:49.973 --> 00:15:51.890 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to do
the same thing for him.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Whatever his talents
and desires about what

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:58.180 align:middle line:84%
he wants to do in
his life, they'll

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.800 align:middle line:84%
do their best to find him a
place that he's happy with.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.080 align:middle line:90%
Because that's what they do.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were you ever
encouraged or discouraged

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:08.140 align:middle line:84%
by your commanders not
to associate with--

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No, not at all.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:13.270 align:middle line:84%
They actually were
pretty much fine with it.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:17.290 align:middle line:84%
They basically-- their
criteria was simply

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:21.220 align:middle line:84%
to be respectful of
their cultural standards,

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.700 align:middle line:84%
be respectful of
their cultural norms,

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:29.835 align:middle line:84%
and to not engage with
a member of the species

00:16:29.835 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
in a way that
would be considered

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:35.338 align:middle line:84%
dysfunctional, harmful,
unhealthy, violent,

00:16:35.338 --> 00:16:36.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,
that sort of thing.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.480 align:middle line:84%
We were sort of given a
briefing on what was acceptable

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:90%
and what was not acceptable.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And again, not
necessarily encouraged

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.985 align:middle line:84%
or discouraged,
but not discouraged

00:16:47.985 --> 00:16:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and told that we
weren't allowed.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.235 align:middle line:84%
But again, they weren't
like, yeah, go ahead.

00:16:51.235 --> 00:16:52.840 align:middle line:84%
It was just more
like, you know, we're

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.190 align:middle line:90%
going to be here for a while.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.180 align:middle line:90%
We're socializing.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.060 align:middle line:84%
If you find yourself, you
know, in a relationship,

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:02.195 align:middle line:84%
here's some things to
consider and so forth.

00:17:02.195 --> 00:17:04.805 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is love the same way
how we feel it emotionally?

00:17:04.805 --> 00:17:06.305 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It depends
on the species.

00:17:06.305 --> 00:17:08.599 align:middle line:84%
I have certainly
experienced species

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:11.990 align:middle line:84%
who have at least a
level of development

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:16.609 align:middle line:84%
of understanding that we have
if not more so, as well as--

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:18.980 align:middle line:84%
I would have to say the
insectoid species is

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:84%
a good example of a species
that has a low emotional--

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:26.930 align:middle line:90%
what do I want to say?

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.639 align:middle line:90%
They're a low--

00:17:28.639 --> 00:17:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Low
vibration, frequency?

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, so they're
just not very emotional.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:33.860 align:middle line:90%
They have emotions.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.450 align:middle line:90%
They're just not very emotional.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:41.330 align:middle line:84%
So their concept of love
is more intellectual

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.390 align:middle line:90%
than it is based on feeling.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:45.950 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless,
I think they still

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:49.580 align:middle line:84%
have an understanding
of a concept like that.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:55.640 align:middle line:84%
But species who, again, can
have a stronger emotional sense

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:84%
of themselves or their
families or their cultures

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:02.000 align:middle line:84%
can have a very deep
sense of familial love,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.500 align:middle line:84%
partnership love,
love of planet,

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.300 align:middle line:84%
love of species,
love of civilization.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so in some cases, I would
say as developed or more so

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:11.630 align:middle line:90%
than our own.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you seen a species
that was just oversensitive,

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:19.020 align:middle line:84%
that you had to be debriefed on,
be careful around this species

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:19.820 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.880 align:middle line:90%


00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yes.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:27.330 align:middle line:84%
There was an interaction on
the Intergalactic Space Station

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:29.537 align:middle line:84%
where, because of this
species' sensitivity,

00:18:29.537 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:90%
we didn't meet in the main room.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.320 align:middle line:84%
We had to meet in a
room downstairs that

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.730 align:middle line:90%
was very isolated.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.260 align:middle line:90%
We had a debriefing.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Only members who
of the team who had

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.360 align:middle line:84%
been able to demonstrate
a certain level

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.150 align:middle line:84%
of emotional discipline
were allowed to go.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And we were actually given
some pharmaceutical drug

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:51.740 align:middle line:84%
that repressed, you
know, sort of anger

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and sort of intense
emotions so that it

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:55.190 align:middle line:90%
muted what we were doing.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:19:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And we were encouraged to
feel blankly as possible.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Just because anything that
we experienced as emotion

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.690 align:middle line:84%
could be really
intense for them,

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:84%
which could cause them to
get very emotionally intense,

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.110 align:middle line:84%
which would cause us to get
very emotionally intense.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very interesting
process for sure.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:19.230 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, it was a very--

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:21.320 align:middle line:84%
it was a very
interesting conversation.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:25.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they-- in
fact, I would have

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:29.060 align:middle line:84%
to say that the conversation
seemed to be directed more

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.390 align:middle line:84%
by how they felt about
things than whether it

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:34.820 align:middle line:84%
was intellectually or
mathematically satisfying.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So in a very crude way, I would
say that you know, their--

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some species have
right and left brains.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.997 align:middle line:84%
But some species also have
more quadrants, you know?

00:19:47.997 --> 00:19:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Many lobes, yeah.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah,
many lobes, which

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.940 align:middle line:84%
makes it very interesting
and very complicated

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.815 align:middle line:84%
where you don't just
have a left and a right.

00:19:54.815 --> 00:19:58.920 align:middle line:84%
You have lots of different
sides, as it were.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So it was a
fascinating experience,

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:90%
fascinating experience.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And when we ended the meeting,
you know, everyone stood up.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And each member of this
other species came up to us

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:14.050 align:middle line:84%
and sort of gave
us this embrace,

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:17.207 align:middle line:84%
a long almost awkward
kind of embrace,

00:20:17.207 --> 00:20:18.790 align:middle line:84%
you know, as a way
of sort of ending--

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.748 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you going
to let me go yet, Randy?

00:20:20.748 --> 00:20:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It was like, how long
am I going to have to do this?

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:26.510 align:middle line:90%
OK, just wait 'til they let go.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:27.470 align:middle line:90%
They break first.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, because if you break
away, they can be offended.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.430 align:middle line:84%
They could be very
offended by that.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, but it was a little
awkward, a little emotionally

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:37.850 align:middle line:90%
awkward, yeah.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:39.725 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what were
the standard protocols

00:20:39.725 --> 00:20:43.940 align:middle line:84%
for communication before
you go on these missions?

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: You know,
we're briefed.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.150 align:middle line:84%
So again, it depends
on where we're going,

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:51.590 align:middle line:84%
what the species and their
level of civilization, language,

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:90%
so forth.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:84%
So we're briefed and given
a sort of list of dos

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.967 align:middle line:84%
and don'ts based
on their culture.

00:20:57.967 --> 00:20:59.550 align:middle line:84%
So you don't want
to go into a culture

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.758 align:middle line:84%
and do something that's
considered offensive, that we

00:21:01.758 --> 00:21:04.590 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't consider offensive, but
they might consider offensive.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And so again, there's just
sort of a list of general

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:10.340 align:middle line:84%
do's and don'ts so that we
don't cause any intergalactic

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.240 align:middle line:90%
incidents.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: All right.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.248 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a favorite ET?

00:21:14.248 --> 00:21:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oo, that's
a good question.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's a
good one, right?

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, that's a
really good question.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.070 align:middle line:90%
A favorite?

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.870 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:21.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:24.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like, when you say
that, like immediately, I've

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.350 align:middle line:84%
kind of got a top 10 list
that sort of comes to mind.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:31.290 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, all right, so we did
encounter a Canis Major

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.070 align:middle line:90%
species, like dog people.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.610 align:middle line:84%
So they were about
5 and 1/2 feet tall,

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:44.570 align:middle line:84%
wore short of a charcoal gray
robe with a red fringe on it.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.240 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Well bathed, well
manicured, very clean.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:55.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you've ever
heard of a husky talk,

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:56.935 align:middle line:90%
they don't bark they [BARKS].

00:21:56.935 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, that's
how they talked.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So you know, they
talked like dog people.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And their racial
background and sort

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:09.500 align:middle line:84%
of mixing in their own world
meant that they kind of

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.190 align:middle line:84%
had some distinctive
racial groups that we would

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.060 align:middle line:90%
consider like breed groups.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So if I were to say
there was a member

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.060 align:middle line:84%
of the ambassadorial
team that was sort

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.300 align:middle line:84%
of German shepherd-like,
sort of sheepdog-like,

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:84%
I want to emphasize that
that's not exactly like.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.953 align:middle line:84%
But that's the most similar
thing that I could describe.

00:22:28.953 --> 00:22:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So it was very
interesting to be sitting

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:34.710 align:middle line:84%
across the table
with dog people.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:37.520 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things I found
the most fascinating about them

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.370 align:middle line:84%
is they were deeply
fascinated by us.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.760 align:middle line:90%
Because we have canines as pets.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And they felt that that
was a very interesting

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.620 align:middle line:84%
dynamic relationship
that we had with them.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.302 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly enough,
they have pet primates.

00:22:52.302 --> 00:22:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I was about to say,
do they have human pets?

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.885 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well,
they're primates.

00:22:55.885 --> 00:22:59.730 align:middle line:84%
So you know, like a monkey or
a marmoset kind of a thing.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And so we kind of
had this conversation

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:84%
about this inverse
metaphysical, you know,

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.770 align:middle line:84%
relationship
between our species.

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And so they felt very friendly
towards us for that reason.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of had the same,
you know, feeling towards them.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very
positive interaction.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And definitely of
all my experiences,

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:24.170 align:middle line:84%
that one really
sticks out for sure.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:27.500 align:middle line:84%
They were really very
pleasant to hang out with

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.570 align:middle line:90%
and really smart and fun.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you ever seen
a species that's Egyptian?

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Interestingly enough,
there were a couple of times

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.540 align:middle line:84%
that we were aboard the
intergalactic space station.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
side of the room,

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.210 align:middle line:84%
there was this species that's
probably about between 50

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:49.280 align:middle line:90%
and 60 feet tall, quite large.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:54.200 align:middle line:84%
They definitely had sort of
a hairstyling and, you know,

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.770 align:middle line:84%
the beard with the
wrap around on it.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And they tended to prefer
a tunic-type clothing.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:06.422 align:middle line:84%
The fabric was amazing, like
had some amazing patterns to it.

00:24:06.422 --> 00:24:07.880 align:middle line:84%
That was the
immediate thing that I

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.230 align:middle line:90%
saw when I looked in the room.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:12.740 align:middle line:84%
It was like, oh, that seems
very Egyptian, pharaoh-esque

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was
the skin color like?

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: A variation that--

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was sort
of a pinkish color,

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:24.360 align:middle line:84%
an orangeish shade, a reddish
shade, and a brownish shade.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.570 align:middle line:84%
So of the shades
that I observed,

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.810 align:middle line:84%
there was probably four or
five different color tones.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you notice
any personality traits?

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.315 align:middle line:84%
Or were you just from
afar looking at them?

00:24:36.315 --> 00:24:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Did you notice anything
that stood out?

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.442 align:middle line:90%


00:24:40.442 --> 00:24:42.192 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I mean, other
than their height?

00:24:42.192 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, this is the
largest being in the room.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.317 align:middle line:90%
So all eyes are on me.

00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:46.117 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:24:46.117 --> 00:24:46.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was shocking.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.383 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is nothing to make
you feel very, very tiny other

00:24:52.383 --> 00:24:54.550 align:middle line:84%
than being in the room of
something very, very tall.

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:56.425 align:middle line:84%
So I mean like "Jack
and the Beanstalk" tall.

00:24:56.425 --> 00:24:59.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it felt very, very tiny
anywhere in the room with them.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:00.140 align:middle line:90%
It was a little intimidating.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:00.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Very intimidating.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It was a
little intimidating,

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:02.300 align:middle line:90%
little terrifying.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: These guys are the
most intimidating creatures

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.320 align:middle line:90%
I have ever met.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Now, I hadn't
encountered them personally.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.130 align:middle line:84%
But the ambassador corps that we
were with, the ambassador with,

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:11.630 align:middle line:90%
had spoken to them before.

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I had a conversation
with him about them.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said that they
were incredibly like us

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.680 align:middle line:84%
as human beings, not just
they looked like us physically

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.180 align:middle line:84%
but were much taller,
but socially, culturally,

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.760 align:middle line:84%
male-female dynamic,
very similar.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:33.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he would say that
the main difference between us

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:35.570 align:middle line:90%
was height.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, I
wonder why that is.

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:40.278 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why do you think
we're so much like them?

00:25:40.278 --> 00:25:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well,
interestingly enough,

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:44.050 align:middle line:90%
that's a fascinating question.

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Speaking to the members of the
ambassadorial corps about this,

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:52.230 align:middle line:84%
they talked about how there are
many, many different species

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:53.580 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:57.240 align:middle line:84%
But there does appear to be
a very interesting pattern

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.690 align:middle line:90%
of repetition.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:01.170 align:middle line:84%
So while there are many,
many, many species,

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:04.740 align:middle line:84%
it's not uncommon at all
to see things that seem

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.680 align:middle line:90%
to repeat in nature, repeat--

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.680 align:middle line:90%
you know, we're here.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Someone else is on the
other end of the galaxy.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.150 align:middle line:84%
But oh, look how
amazingly similar we are.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Or oh, here's a species we
met that's from over here.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
species way over here.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And look how incredibly
similar they are.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So some of it we think based
on our understanding of history

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:26.610 align:middle line:84%
is some common ancestry,
some common genetic mixing.

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:28.470 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
theory, which

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:34.240 align:middle line:84%
is that the universe
replicates math that works.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And so these are
equations in the math

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.030 align:middle line:90%
of the universe that work.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And so at some point,
the universe goes,

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.160 align:middle line:84%
yeah, let's do that
math here again.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.588 align:middle line:90%
Because that worked over here.

00:26:43.588 --> 00:26:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Except maybe you
have a planet that's

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:47.090 align:middle line:84%
much larger in a
red star system.

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:50.080 align:middle line:90%
So they're 55 feet tall.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's an oxygen, nitrogen,
carbon dioxide atmosphere.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So organic, maybe humanoid
life would thrive there.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's a combination
of probably, you know,

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.940 align:middle line:84%
creator species as well as
we think something innate

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.010 align:middle line:84%
within the universe
or the cosmos itself

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:11.030 align:middle line:84%
that repeats mathematical
equations that are successful.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So visiting
these galactic stations

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and on these
missions, did you also

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:21.100 align:middle line:84%
notice any pets that other
extraterrestrials had on them?

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, Neha
actually had this primate

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.610 align:middle line:84%
that was, again, kind of like
a marmoset, about this big,

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.190 align:middle line:84%
eyes about that big
around, actually pretty

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.920 align:middle line:90%
intelligent and very friendly.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And the first time that
I was at their house,

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.210 align:middle line:84%
he was absolutely
terrified of me.

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.450 align:middle line:84%
But that was because
he smelled me.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And I smelled like something
he'd never smelled in his life

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.330 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.100 align:middle line:84%
So the first couple
of times I was there,

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.520 align:middle line:84%
he would run to the other
room and kind of stare

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.760 align:middle line:90%
around the corner.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:53.560 align:middle line:84%
But then I started
bringing snacks for him.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And then once I started-- once
he realized that I had snacks,

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.820 align:middle line:84%
then, you know,
he would come over

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and start crawling and looking
in my pockets for carrots

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:02.200 align:middle line:90%
or whatever I'd brought for him.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was he
able to communicate?

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Not verbally.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.080 align:middle line:84%
But I would say in the same way
that a dog or cat communicates

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:09.880 align:middle line:90%
with us.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he was very intelligent.

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And you could tell what he
was thinking or feeling based

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.110 align:middle line:84%
on certain gestures,
body language,

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.960 align:middle line:84%
so forth in the same way that
you can tell kind of what

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.600 align:middle line:84%
a dog or a cat is thinking or
feeling based on their body

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.710 align:middle line:90%
language and so forth.

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what
was that, you know,

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.300 align:middle line:90%
communication like with Neha?

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.470 align:middle line:90%
Was it verbal?

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:32.025 align:middle line:90%
Was it telepathic?

00:28:32.025 --> 00:28:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER:
Interestingly enough, I

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.220 align:middle line:84%
would say that their
psionic development is

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.320 align:middle line:90%
slightly more than ours.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.130 align:middle line:90%
So they have a--

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:45.460 align:middle line:84%
it's more normal for
them as a species

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:49.480 align:middle line:84%
to be trained and experience
psionic development

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.930 align:middle line:90%
as they get older.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:53.860 align:middle line:84%
So their language is
definitely verbal.

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.700 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
psionic component.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So there's a verbal-psionic
communication that's

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.460 align:middle line:90%
happening at the same time.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And when I was
learning the language,

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:05.980 align:middle line:84%
for a long time as I
was getting the words,

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.000 align:middle line:90%
you know, she would--

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.667 align:middle line:84%
she would tell me, she was like,
no, no it's not just the words.

00:29:09.667 --> 00:29:12.490 align:middle line:84%
She was like, you know, you want
to feel what you're thinking.

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And you want to, you know,
think it your brain to my brain.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And it took a little practice to
engage in a verbal conversation

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:25.930 align:middle line:84%
that was a mental focus
of what I was doing

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.320 align:middle line:84%
with my mouth and my tongue
as far as the words were

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.100 align:middle line:84%
concerned, but
having to also focus

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.147 align:middle line:84%
on what my mind and my
thoughts and my emotions

00:29:35.147 --> 00:29:36.730 align:middle line:84%
were doing, which
we don't necessarily

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:37.960 align:middle line:90%
have to do that as human means.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.877 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think sometimes
we do the opposite,

00:29:39.877 --> 00:29:42.700 align:middle line:84%
where we can say one thing
and be thinking and feeling

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.040 align:middle line:90%
something completely different.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.490 align:middle line:90%
And you can't do that with them.

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:48.490 align:middle line:84%
You really have to sync
up what you're saying

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:51.030 align:middle line:84%
and what you're thinking
and your feeling and be--

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:54.550 align:middle line:84%
it requires a tremendous
amount of more focus.

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:57.970 align:middle line:84%
But I would have to say
that their communication

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:03.020 align:middle line:84%
ability, their communication
level was way deeper than ours.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're a very communicative
species, you know?

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:10.180 align:middle line:84%
We actually are very verbally
and communicationally

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.110 align:middle line:90%
expressive.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.550 align:middle line:90%
But they were even more so.

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:17.680 align:middle line:84%
So conversations could get
very complex, deeply emotional

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.640 align:middle line:90%
and psychological.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.280 align:middle line:90%


00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just a whole
other level of--

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.322 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about sitting down
with your best friend, the best

00:30:27.322 --> 00:30:28.780 align:middle line:84%
partner you have
ever had and think

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.960 align:middle line:84%
about the level of intimate
personal conversation

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.580 align:middle line:90%
you can have with that person.

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:36.108 align:middle line:84%
That's a standard conversation
with these people.

00:30:36.108 --> 00:30:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's a form of
telepathy, would you say?

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:39.275 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:30:39.275 --> 00:30:42.175 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because the language
of the universe is telepathy.

00:30:42.175 --> 00:30:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yes.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In the future
it will be known.

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.763 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because I
like what you said.

00:30:45.763 --> 00:30:47.670 align:middle line:90%
Because I also experienced that.

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:49.360 align:middle line:90%
It's an emotion thing.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I have to ground myself before
I go into a room with an ET.

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Because if I'm upset and
I say, hi, in my mind,

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.920 align:middle line:90%
it's like yelling hi.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So I understand when you
say you're verbally speaking

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.770 align:middle line:84%
and you're giving the
intent of the emotion, which

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.980 align:middle line:84%
I think people should
understand that's how it is.

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:12.400 align:middle line:84%
They're reading all of
you, not just, you know,

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.600 align:middle line:90%
the verbal part.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's great that Neha
said, put it in with the voice.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Put the energy the
emotion in with it.

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's a great way
for people to practice.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.910 align:middle line:90%
I think you probably teach that.

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, well,
I mean, and if you

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:28.040 align:middle line:84%
think about just how we
communicate as human beings,

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.165 align:middle line:90%
we have a verbal component.

00:31:29.165 --> 00:31:30.820 align:middle line:84%
We have a facial
expression component.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.650 align:middle line:84%
We have a body
language component.

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:34.900 align:middle line:84%
So just think you're
adding more components

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.700 align:middle line:90%
to that communication.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:40.702 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How did you learn
the language, her language?

00:31:40.702 --> 00:31:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: You know,
they taught me.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.438 align:middle line:84%
And again, because it's this
verbal-psionic thing, when

00:31:46.438 --> 00:31:47.980 align:middle line:84%
they were communicating
with me, they

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.660 align:middle line:84%
were really attempting to
download the information

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.460 align:middle line:90%
into my brain.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.930 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to
learn the language

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:55.612 align:middle line:84%
much more quickly than I
would have if I was just,

00:31:55.612 --> 00:31:57.820 align:middle line:84%
you know, using Rosetta
Stone or something like that.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.347 align:middle line:84%
Would you say it's a kind
of programming maybe, too?

00:32:00.347 --> 00:32:01.630 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they're downloading?

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It felt
like that sometimes.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It felt like.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, there
was a-- it's certainly

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.840 align:middle line:84%
like there was struggle,
struggle, struggle, struggle.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And then there was just
a day when it clicked.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And then-- and I was
speaking fairly fluently.

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.920 align:middle line:84%
But I remember
hearing that I wasn't

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.540 align:middle line:90%
speaking like a grown up.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Like you know, I could tell that
I was enunciating my words more

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.990 align:middle line:84%
like a child, so
that I was still--

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:30.150 align:middle line:84%
there was still some precision
that I had to master, for sure.

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:32.460 align:middle line:84%
But there was just a-- like
I said, struggle, struggle,

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:33.260 align:middle line:90%
struggle.

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a time
when it just clicked.

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So who
actually taught you?

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I learned
from her family.

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the more time I spent
with them, the more they

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:42.625 align:middle line:90%
encouraged me to learn words.

00:32:42.625 --> 00:32:44.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, we'd sit
at the dinner table.

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And they would hand me dishes
and say it in their language

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:50.170 align:middle line:84%
and encourage me to ask for
things in their language.

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:53.950 align:middle line:84%
It was-- it almost-- it felt a
little like being a kid again,

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:54.750 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:57.660 align:middle line:84%
With parents trying to encourage
you to talk and how to speak

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.220 align:middle line:90%
like a grown up.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:02.250 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, it felt
a little condescending.

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:05.250 align:middle line:84%
But I know it wasn't
meant that way.

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:09.720 align:middle line:84%
We weren't taught or compelled
to learn the language on base.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:14.230 align:middle line:84%
They actually-- they're
very fast learners.

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And so most of them
learned to speak

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:19.110 align:middle line:84%
English in a much
quicker time than it took

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:21.220 align:middle line:90%
us to learn their language.

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So we engaged with
a number of them,

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:25.957 align:middle line:84%
mostly with them
speaking English.

00:33:25.957 --> 00:33:27.540 align:middle line:84%
But there were, of
course, many people

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.000 align:middle line:84%
in the community that didn't
speak a lick of English.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you ran into them and
you were speaking to them

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:33.917 align:middle line:84%
in English and they
were speaking to you

00:33:33.917 --> 00:33:36.665 align:middle line:84%
in their native language,
it'd be like, you know,

00:33:36.665 --> 00:33:38.790 align:middle line:84%
going to Italy and not
being able to speak Italian.

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:40.210 align:middle line:90%
You know, you'd be confused.

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:42.418 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't know exactly
what each other was saying.

00:33:42.418 --> 00:33:46.260 align:middle line:84%
But you know, people who had
a reason for business purposes

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.750 align:middle line:84%
or because of their job,
they were interacting

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.140 align:middle line:90%
with us more often than not.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.238 align:middle line:84%
They tended to speak
better English.

00:33:52.238 --> 00:33:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And they were pretty
good at it and, again,

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:56.520 align:middle line:84%
didn't require or
necessarily encourage us

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.050 align:middle line:84%
in professional circumstances
to speak their language.

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:03.870 align:middle line:84%
But in a private interaction,
it just seemed more--

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:05.340 align:middle line:84%
it made everybody
more comfortable

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:09.600 align:middle line:84%
if I was speaking their
language than forcing them

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.179 align:middle line:84%
by not speaking their language
to have to speak my language.
