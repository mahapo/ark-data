>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.230 align:middle line:10%
we are with Duane Ollinger, a
high-risk oil contractor who

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.450 align:middle line:10%
discovered a system
of underground caverns

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:10%
that runs beneath his
160-acre ranch in Utah,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.210 align:middle line:10%
home to some highly
unusual anomalies.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.120 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us is
Tim, a tactical advisor

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.120 align:middle line:10%
to covert analysts trying
to understand the missions

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.570 align:middle line:10%
and strategies of non-human
intelligences on our planet.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DUANE OLLINGER: Thank you.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Duane, much of what you
learned about extraterrestrials

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.700 align:middle line:90%
comes from the General, you say.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.040 align:middle line:90%
Who is this General?

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: He was a guy that
we started dealing with up there

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.460 align:middle line:90%
in Utah.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And he was brought to
us by Don Nicoloff.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Don Nicoloff and
him were friends,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.600 align:middle line:84%
and they were a part of the
project on the east side.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.790 align:middle line:84%
They were helping
us to know where

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.220 align:middle line:90%
to dig and know where to drill.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I came in
contact with Jeremiah Davis.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.150 align:middle line:90%
And he worked for the CIA.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.260 align:middle line:90%
He was brought in to Area 51.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And he was drafted
out of Area 51

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.680 align:middle line:84%
into the United Galactic
Federation of Hindon,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.300 align:middle line:90%
which is 574 different planets.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, he was a
general in the military,

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.950 align:middle line:84%
or that was a nickname that
you guys gave Jeremiah?

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: No, he was a
general in the United Galactic

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Federation on Earth.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
his ranking was here.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.790 align:middle line:90%
He just worked for the CIA.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:90%
He was head of teams.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And he worked
at Area 51, correct?

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.625 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: I don't know
that he ever worked there.

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:56.760 align:middle line:84%
He was brought in to
Area 51, and that's

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.020 align:middle line:84%
where he had the meetings with
the Federation, where they--

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.540 align:middle line:84%
he said it was a
big to do type deal,

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.970 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the
Federation brought down

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.020 align:middle line:90%
one of their craft.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you believe he
was an extraterrestrial?

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: He was from here.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So he started
his career in the CIA,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.690 align:middle line:84%
got brought into Area
51, and then somehow got

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.190 align:middle line:90%
into the Federation?

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.487 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yes, yes.

00:02:21.487 --> 00:02:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And do you know something
about the meetings, how

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.040 align:middle line:90%
they happened?

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Some of the things
I remember he talked about

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.670 align:middle line:84%
was that he didn't know what the
meetings was going to be about,

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.910 align:middle line:84%
but they picked him
up in a big aircraft

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:90%
and flew him into Area 51.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And then that's when that
craft came out of the air

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and that's where they
met the Federation.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Some of the things
that was strange

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.160 align:middle line:84%
was that whenever
that craft came down

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and those people
got out, he said

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.690 align:middle line:84%
that he thought he
was going crazy,

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:84%
because not only seeing that,
but he was hearing things.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And there was people
talking to him.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.260 align:middle line:84%
It was a telepathic
type scenario

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:84%
that he was having a
conversation or hearing things.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
part of the people

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.190 align:middle line:84%
that studied Jeremiah
for over 30 years

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.380 align:middle line:90%
before they brought him in.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was the
General's connection

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.960 align:middle line:90%
with your properties?

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: His connection with
the property was through Don

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Nicoloff--

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:90%
Don Nicoloff and him.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
how they really met.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.030 align:middle line:84%
They monitored Don Nicoloff
heavily because of his radio

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.580 align:middle line:84%
talk show and liked everything
that he talked about.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I guess
maybe that's where

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.880 align:middle line:90%
that connection came from.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So Duane, tell
me about Don's radio show,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and let's get some
timeframes here.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.740 align:middle line:84%
When was Don doing
this radio show?

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:90%
When did Jeremiah meet Don?

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.020 align:middle line:84%
When did Jeremiah
get flown to Area 51

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.198 align:middle line:90%
to meet the Galactic Federation?

00:03:58.198 --> 00:03:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah, I
don't know exact dates.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:84%
I do know that Don
Nicoloff had a radio talk

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.900 align:middle line:90%
show for quite a while.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, when he was
up there with us in Utah--

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What year was that?

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Oh my goodness.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.570 align:middle line:90%
2010, plus or minus.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: We'd have to look
at the dates on all that stuff.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.935 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's fine.

00:04:17.935 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: But Don Nicoloff,
even at night, every few days,

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.030 align:middle line:84%
he would do his radio talk
show up there in a motel room

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.950 align:middle line:84%
while we were up
there on that project.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I'd sit there and listen to him
talk about all kinds of stuff.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what about Jeremiah
when he flew to Area 51--

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.560 align:middle line:84%
do you know approximately
when that was.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Now this
is just guessing here,

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:84%
but I think it was
in the '80s is when

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.120 align:middle line:90%
he was taken into that group.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did he ever talk
about additional meetings,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.717 align:middle line:84%
besides the one at Area 51
when the craft came down?

00:04:51.717 --> 00:04:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Oh gosh, yeah.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.050 align:middle line:90%
He talked about--

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where would
those meetings take place?

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Putin
knows about them.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Obama knows about them.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.010 align:middle line:90%
Trump knows about them.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.010 align:middle line:84%
All those guys know
this whole deal.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:84%
So you said he had
a career in the CIA.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And do you know the
timeframe of how many years

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.460 align:middle line:84%
it was before he joined
the Galactic Federation?

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: If I understood it
right, it was around 30 years

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.830 align:middle line:84%
that he was with the CIA
before they brought him

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:90%
into that other group.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And again, he said
he didn't realize it,

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.150 align:middle line:84%
but they were studying
him for years.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Was he a public person?

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Or was he underground?

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.137 align:middle line:84%
Could you search him in the
phone book and find him?

00:05:35.137 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: I don't
know how to answer that.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I do know that he
said, look, if you

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.660 align:middle line:84%
want to find out anything that
I've done, you'll never see it.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.800 align:middle line:90%
You'll never see it.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.848 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When did the General
start sharing information

00:05:46.848 --> 00:05:48.390 align:middle line:84%
to you about the
Galactic Federation,

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.587 align:middle line:90%
and what did he say about it?

00:05:50.587 --> 00:05:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: It was
during that project

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.310 align:middle line:84%
up there in Utah whenever
we got to see the craft

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.350 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.160 align:middle line:84%
He would, for whatever
reason, after Don Nicoloff

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.540 align:middle line:84%
got a little bit
sick, I just picked up

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.580 align:middle line:90%
conversations with him.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And he would call in and tell
me everything that's going on.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And he always told me
that, everything you say,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Duane, they're listening to.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.410 align:middle line:84%
But I can't prove
this, but I think

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.290 align:middle line:84%
that it was their
way of communicating

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.370 align:middle line:90%
by people that's listening in.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And because he would
always tell me things

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:84%
that there was no
reason for me to know,

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and he would talk
about so many things--

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.290 align:middle line:84%
he would talk about his
meetings with Putin.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.490 align:middle line:90%
He would talk about--

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you share a
little bit with us about that?

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:84%
What'd he say about
those meetings?

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Sure.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was discussed
with these presidents?

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.950 align:middle line:84%
He liked old Putin,
but he says you

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.980 align:middle line:90%
got to keep your finger on him.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Because he don't mind moving
his boundaries, is what he said,

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.020 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did
he share with Putin

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:90%
about the Galactic Federation?

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Oh, Putin
knows every bit of it.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.800 align:middle line:84%
They've had meetings,
craft all around them,

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.660 align:middle line:90%
the whole nine yards.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Putin knows all that and
so do so many other people.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.980 align:middle line:90%
Putin got out of hand one time.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And he was-- gosh,
how many years ago--

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.030 align:middle line:84%
eight or nine years ago,
he was moving this boundary

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:21.900 align:middle line:90%
over a little bit.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And the Federation told him,
they said, don't do that.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And so he moved it
up a little bit.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.100 align:middle line:84%
The Federation made all
of the soldiers get out,

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and they melted that
whole line of equipment.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What line of equipment?

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Putin's
military-type equipment.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is this classified
extraterrestrial vehicles, or--

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.825 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: No, this
was just military--

00:07:46.825 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It was
military equipment?

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And they had the
weaponry to do that.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And Jeremiah would talk
about the weaponry they have

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.700 align:middle line:90%
and how powerful it is and--

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What kind of weapons
did he mention to you?

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: So it's always a
war game up there in space.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.730 align:middle line:84%
You got good and bad
going on all the time.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And their weaponry
is probably what

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.060 align:middle line:84%
he told me would be a thousand
times better than what

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.260 align:middle line:84%
the US would have
or anybody on Earth.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.890 align:middle line:84%
He did talk about where the
North Korean guy was getting

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.520 align:middle line:90%
out of his lane a little bit.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And so the Federation
loaned some weaponry

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.169 align:middle line:84%
to the United States to
show the North Korean guy

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.360 align:middle line:84%
that if he doesn't
get back in his lane,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.400 align:middle line:90%
that it might not be good.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And I asked Jeremiah, I said,
what happens to that guy?

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, if he
doesn't get back in his lane,

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:90%
he goes poof.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.610 align:middle line:90%
I go, really, poof?

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Spontaneous human
combustion, you mean?

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.225 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:54.225 --> 00:08:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, let's
say our military gets

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.670 align:middle line:84%
in the wrong hands
of our military.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.800 align:middle line:84%
What happens to
them if they use it?

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if they use it in
the wrong way, they go poof.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.308 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:09:07.308 --> 00:09:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they
have control, you're

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.870 align:middle line:84%
saying, over us, this
Galactic Federation over Earth

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.977 align:middle line:90%
and all the militaries.

00:09:14.977 --> 00:09:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: They let things
go the way it's going to go.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.020 align:middle line:90%
But for whatever I've seen--

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.020 align:middle line:84%
and I know this sounds
crazy and I can't prove it--

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:27.270 align:middle line:84%
but the crafts that I've
seen, I would be surprised

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.350 align:middle line:90%
if any nuclear weapon works.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.567 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: That
is so old school,

00:09:31.567 --> 00:09:34.650 align:middle line:84%
it's unreal, compared
to the stories.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.150 align:middle line:84%
He talks about that there's
major crafts out in our galaxy.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.280 align:middle line:90%
And there's some bad guys.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.950 align:middle line:84%
There's good guys,
and there's bad guys.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about
the battles they

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.460 align:middle line:84%
were in with their weaponry
where some of the battles

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.110 align:middle line:90%
they got into.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.170 align:middle line:84%
It took an advanced
computer system

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.960 align:middle line:84%
to even win the battles
on these big craft

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.130 align:middle line:90%
that they were fighting.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.400 align:middle line:84%
But they surrounded them with
theirs and with the computer

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.070 align:middle line:84%
system, and firing
all at one time

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.900 align:middle line:90%
is how they won the battle.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did he ever mention
the names of those civilizations

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:90%
that we're battling out there?

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: He talked about
where they got into a battle

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:23.260 align:middle line:84%
with one huge craft, and it was
very hard on those people that

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.340 align:middle line:90%
was in the battle.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.710 align:middle line:84%
Because whenever they
blowed that object up,

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:31.120 align:middle line:84%
there was this white
blond-headed race just

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.880 align:middle line:90%
floating off into space.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And so it took a lot of
counseling for his people

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.430 align:middle line:90%
because it was hard on them.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.460 align:middle line:84%
But it was a battle that those
people wouldn't back off.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying
to do things that

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.920 align:middle line:90%
weren't supposed to be done.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.135 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Such as?

00:10:50.135 --> 00:10:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: He
never really said.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.990 align:middle line:84%
But there's other entities
that are always constantly,

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.770 align:middle line:84%
if I understand it right,
trying to take over Earth.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why do you
believe they're trying

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:01.920 align:middle line:90%
to interact with mankind?

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.350 align:middle line:90%
What's your opinion on that?

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Well, because--

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Is there an agenda?

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Did he ever share anything
with you about that?

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: I really think
that the biggest problem is

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.740 align:middle line:84%
that they don't want us blowing
up our Earth, because it

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.670 align:middle line:84%
affects everybody else out
there somewhere, too, I guess.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What can you tell us
about the races that are part

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.320 align:middle line:90%
of this Galactic Federation?

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Oh, it's
not 574 different races.

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:90%
It's 574 different planets.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's all the
planets that have

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.410 align:middle line:90%
accepted their way of life.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth is something
that they're working on,

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.350 align:middle line:84%
but they think it's a ways off
because of how our thinking is.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: You mentioned
political figures.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, Israel talked about
the Galactic Federation.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Do you think this is the
same Galactic Federation?

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: That's
something I don't know.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Because he told me that
not only is there one,

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:84%
there's thousands of these
different federations.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Something
that I can confirm

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.650 align:middle line:84%
is that there are indeed
lots and lots of federations

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:13.450 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:84%
So I was just curious because
the officials in Israel

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.980 align:middle line:84%
talked about the Galactic
Federation in contact

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.720 align:middle line:90%
with the government.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.130 align:middle line:90%
They didn't specify which it is.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.000 align:middle line:84%
But it could very well be
the one you're talking about.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.990 align:middle line:84%
But indeed, there are a lot
of federations and alliances

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And you're absolutely
right to say

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:42.627 align:middle line:84%
that there's alliance-building
everywhere in the universe.

00:12:42.627 --> 00:12:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you tell
us a little bit more

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.130 align:middle line:84%
and elaborate on the
different members

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:51.080 align:middle line:84%
that Jeremiah was interacting
with from around the universe?

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: He would talk about
these real tall white-looking

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.460 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.160 align:middle line:84%
He talked about
where they captured

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:90%
a general that was a reptilian.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Very high-level mind
control-type guy.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.578 align:middle line:84%
He talked about
that a bunch where--

00:13:12.578 --> 00:13:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did he mention
anything about what

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.480 align:middle line:90%
the reptilian looked like?

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.040 align:middle line:90%
Real beefy, stout.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.180 align:middle line:84%
Whenever they took
him in on their ship,

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.440 align:middle line:84%
it was like a glass bubble
that they had to keep him in

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.168 align:middle line:84%
or he could end up
controlling or--

00:13:31.168 --> 00:13:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, using
psionics, right?

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: He talked
about that a lot.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.640 align:middle line:84%
But he also talked
about that even

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:44.310 align:middle line:84%
that general for
the reptilian race

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:51.480 align:middle line:84%
still believed in one creator
and all the different things.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.690 align:middle line:84%
He said it was very
interesting to hear

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.350 align:middle line:90%
what they would talk about.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And then they released
him after that.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.350 align:middle line:84%
But that was one
of the requests,

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:03.580 align:middle line:90%
to capture somebody like that.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.410 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You mentioned
the tall whites.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.170 align:middle line:84%
What more can you
tell us about them?

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: The tall whites--

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Jeremiah, he never had
very good luck with them.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:17.560 align:middle line:84%
They were always trying
to come in on him

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.980 align:middle line:90%
and things of that nature.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:25.870 align:middle line:84%
For whatever reason, if
they did come in on him,

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:31.420 align:middle line:84%
he would be where he could move
and things like that sometimes.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And he'd have these
dips out of his skin.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Always about three
little dips, like

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.790 align:middle line:84%
they were taking
samples or something.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Explain
to me a little bit.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.390 align:middle line:90%
You just said come in on him.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean-- you're
talking about these dips,

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.320 align:middle line:90%
they got tissue samples.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.490 align:middle line:90%
What were they doing to him?

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.060 align:middle line:84%
He would say that we don't
have a very good defense system

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.250 align:middle line:90%
against these type of people.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.340 align:middle line:84%
They can materialize
or dematerialize

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.570 align:middle line:90%
and walk through walls.

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And then pretty rough
batch of cats sometimes.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So why did
they pick Jeremiah?

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:06.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he's human.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.650 align:middle line:84%
You said he's like
an ambassador.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And what is all
about the membership

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.840 align:middle line:84%
to get into the
Galactic Federation?

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Did he ever talk about that?

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: He talked
about it in a way

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.970 align:middle line:90%
that they monitor everybody.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.320 align:middle line:90%
They know about everybody.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.750 align:middle line:90%
They know about me and you, you.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:25.560 align:middle line:90%
They know.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.450 align:middle line:90%
And they monitor that deal.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:29.560 align:middle line:90%
How they do it, I don't know.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:37.100 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason, he
passed the test, I guess.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.540 align:middle line:90%
And they picked him.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.410 align:middle line:90%
Now, did they pick anybody else?

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:46.730 align:middle line:84%
They picked one
more of his group

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.760 align:middle line:84%
that he used to work
with, and that was a lady.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And she's being
trained right now.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What's her name?

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Her
first name is Karen,

00:15:56.150 --> 00:16:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and they never told me anything
more than that after that.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.380 align:middle line:84%
But she is a part
of that group now.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:08.340 align:middle line:84%
She's going to be taking
over what he used to do.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And do they just come
and go freely as they want?

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.470 align:middle line:90%
Is there something set up?

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Like, we're going to meet
on this day, at this area.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:16.860 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.710 align:middle line:90%
Is it all just telepathy?

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Well,
what I understand

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.320 align:middle line:84%
is that there has to even
be permission before they

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.950 align:middle line:90%
come into this planet.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a big
old theater out there.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.990 align:middle line:84%
He said there's not thousands,
there's tens of thousands

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.600 align:middle line:90%
watching at all times.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And they have to get
permission to leave here.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Like if you think we're
going to launch a craft

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and you don't get permission,
you don't get to go in.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.230 align:middle line:90%
So some of the stuff is--

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:57.220 align:middle line:84%
So people assume that all these
ETs come and go as they please.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.270 align:middle line:84%
But this is basically
not the thing.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So what you say is
absolutely correct.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have a ring of
protection around the Earth.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And ETs needs proper paperwork
in order to come and go.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.359 align:middle line:84%
There are, of course, some
illegal aliens, so to speak,

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:18.730 align:middle line:84%
that sneak themselves
into Earth.

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.442 align:middle line:84%
But what you say is
absolutely correct, yes.

00:17:21.442 --> 00:17:23.109 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: He always
talked about that.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:28.119 align:middle line:84%
He says, you just
don't get to do that.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.400 align:middle line:84%
So they even have
to have permission

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.320 align:middle line:84%
to let you or I see
one of those craft.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: I mean, they
say that that's a no-no.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:44.160 align:middle line:84%
So two weeks before I seen
the craft in Amarillo, Texas,

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.830 align:middle line:84%
in my house-- and I lived
out in the country--

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:50.430 align:middle line:84%
he sent me a picture of
what the craft looks like.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Said, Duane, this
is my nightly ride.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:53.030 align:middle line:90%
This is--

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:56.275 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So he drew, or he
actually took a picture?

00:17:56.275 --> 00:17:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Took a picture.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you
have this picture?

00:17:58.290 --> 00:17:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:10%
He said that you have
to have permission

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:10%
to even show anybody.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And so what was strange to me
was that about two weeks later,

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.840 align:middle line:84%
about 5 o'clock in the
morning, I just woke up.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I needed
to get up, go outside

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.440 align:middle line:84%
with a set of
binoculars, and look up.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, that's the
craziest thing I ever heard.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: But I did.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.480 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get the binoculars.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.340 align:middle line:90%
I was lazy, I guess.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:84%
But I went out and looked up,
and there was the biggest craft

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:90%
floating over my house.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And they would
turn the lights on.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.090 align:middle line:90%
They were doing like a--

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.120 align:middle line:90%
it was crazy.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:40.920 align:middle line:90%
And it was huge.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.370 align:middle line:90%
And it was not making any noise.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.560 align:middle line:84%
So I was so excited
about that whole deal.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.195 align:middle line:84%
And I called Jeremiah that day
or that night or something.

00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:52.320 align:middle line:84%
I said, Jeremiah, you're
not going to believe this.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.640 align:middle line:90%
And he said, it was us, Duane.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:84%
He wouldn't let me
talk about it, though.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.340 align:middle line:90%
He would not.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.440 align:middle line:90%
And I said, come on.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.490 align:middle line:90%
And he said, it was us.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.710 align:middle line:84%
He would never let
me talk about that.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So I wondered if they didn't
break a little bit of a rule

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.420 align:middle line:90%
to let me see that.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Because he would not.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.760 align:middle line:90%
He would not.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing
he would do was

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.400 align:middle line:84%
he said, Duane, our group always
thought you were telepathic,

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:84%
and that was one of
the tests that we

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.560 align:middle line:90%
needed to show our group.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.880 align:middle line:90%
I thought, well--

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.267 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You definitely passed.

00:19:27.267 --> 00:19:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: I guess.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You woke
up and went out.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because Jeremiah
was a CIA member,

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:36.020 align:middle line:84%
do you think the government
has a relationship

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.317 align:middle line:90%
with the Galactic Federation?

00:19:37.317 --> 00:19:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah, I
would think they'd

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.600 align:middle line:84%
have to have a
relationship with them.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.832 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did he ever talk
about that relationship?

00:19:43.832 --> 00:19:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah, he would
talk about having meetings

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.250 align:middle line:90%
with Trump.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:50.000 align:middle line:84%
He would even talk
about the times

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.520 align:middle line:90%
where they would be in meetings.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And from a distance, Obama would
be at that meeting and things

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Does every president
have this relationship

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.370 align:middle line:90%
with the Galactic Federation?

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what do
we know about that?

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: I just
know the meetings

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.190 align:middle line:84%
that he talked about
on having meetings

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.600 align:middle line:90%
with different governments.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So I think they're
tied to a bunch.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Or at least they try to talk
them into changing their ways.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:21.710 align:middle line:84%
India-- I remember him
talking about having

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:90%
a big ceremony in India.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And one of the strangest
things about that was they

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.730 align:middle line:84%
had this big celebration
and big meeting

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.200 align:middle line:90%
and the whole nine yards.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And there was a bull elephant
that came charging the crowd.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And with their weaponry,
they had to put him down

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.700 align:middle line:84%
because he was going to
kill a bunch of people.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did he
ever talk about what

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.780 align:middle line:90%
their regard for human life is?

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Oh, yeah.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.475 align:middle line:90%
It's as precious as it gets.

00:20:54.475 --> 00:20:57.430 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.550 align:middle line:84%
He would talk about
whenever they were in battle

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and somebody would
lose their life,

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.380 align:middle line:90%
it was just heartbreaking.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So why are they
helping certain countries

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.450 align:middle line:84%
instead of looking at
humanity as a whole?

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Like we talked
about earlier, they

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:14.110 align:middle line:84%
were helping us with some
technology and weapons

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:15.340 align:middle line:90%
for the United States.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.040 align:middle line:84%
What determines the
United States gets it

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.740 align:middle line:90%
and not an opposing factor?

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: I think
that what I understood

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:26.350 align:middle line:84%
was that the North Korean guy
was getting out of his lane

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:31.530 align:middle line:84%
as far as being a rebel
and going to hurt humanity.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:35.102 align:middle line:84%
And so they helped in
that perspective, I guess.

00:21:35.102 --> 00:21:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So it's
just because there

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.600 align:middle line:84%
might have been an
outside threat where

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.230 align:middle line:84%
a lot of innocent
people would die.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:43.050 align:middle line:84%
So they intervened
to show force.

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And they can step out of
their rules and regulations

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.650 align:middle line:84%
on if somebody's
going to get way far--

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they
allowed to actually

00:21:53.420 --> 00:22:01.250 align:middle line:84%
intervene physically or astrally
to prevent an apocalyptic issue

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:02.990 align:middle line:90%
or a lot of death?

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Or do they have to
utilize a country

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:90%
to represent to do that?

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: I know that it's
nothing for them to take down

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:14.850 align:middle line:90%
a nuclear weapon.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.610 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Jeremiah was a part of
the Dome of the Rock,

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:26.070 align:middle line:84%
where it shows that
craft over the top of it.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.160 align:middle line:90%
It dropped down.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.700 align:middle line:90%
It fires a beam down in there.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, what people might not
know that he told me about was

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.220 align:middle line:90%
there was a baby nuke in there.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was threatening that
part of that whole area.

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.260 align:middle line:90%
And so they had craft come in.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.310 align:middle line:90%
They dropped down.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Jeremiah was one of the pilots
with two other pilots with him.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.290 align:middle line:90%
Because it's all about thought.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And they dropped down, fired
the beam, and then shot up.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look
on the internet,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.410 align:middle line:90%
people wonder what that was.

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:04.020 align:middle line:90%
That was them.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about
other places that they

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:11.370 align:middle line:84%
had to take out hidden,
you might say, baby nukes.

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And then they brought in
a Israeli extraction team

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:18.610 align:middle line:84%
to take care of the
rest of the problem.

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So do you think there
are oppositional forces that

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.470 align:middle line:84%
are working together
with humans on Earth

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.470 align:middle line:84%
but stay in opposition to
the Galactic Federation?

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.430 align:middle line:90%
He said it's always a battle.

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think if I understood
what he was telling me,

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.240 align:middle line:84%
it would be the
point that there's

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.960 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people that's
trying to persuade

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:48.000 align:middle line:84%
us to do their way instead
of the Federation's way.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So I would have to
say, yeah, there's

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:52.320 align:middle line:90%
opposing that's trying to help.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:57.130 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the agenda of the
other batch of cats, I guess.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It's true.

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.510 align:middle line:84%
The government
always says what ETs

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.120 align:middle line:84%
have in mind what's
good for Earth might not

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.662 align:middle line:84%
be the same thing that humans
have in mind for themselves.

00:24:06.662 --> 00:24:07.620 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: But there
are different kinds

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:16.410 align:middle line:84%
of Grey beings out there, which
is more or less a common skin

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:17.260 align:middle line:90%
color.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:22.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's easy to throw them
all in the same species.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.890 align:middle line:84%
What was your conversation
with the General like?

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:29.610 align:middle line:84%
What did he say about
the Greys' encounters,

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:31.980 align:middle line:90%
and different other species?

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: He did say
that they were monitoring

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:38.840 align:middle line:84%
the equipment out there
that we had while we

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.010 align:middle line:90%
were doing that project.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And there would
be craft come in,

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and these little
Greys would get off

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and they'd go play on the
equipment like a bunch of kids.

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:47.170 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:48.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:49.760 align:middle line:90%
--he never said that they were--

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Hostile?

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Bad.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: They
just kind of nosey.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you
personally seen

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.290 align:middle line:90%
any extraterrestrial types?

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: So I
can say yes to one.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And I asked Jeremiah Davis what
they looked like, his crew.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, they're
just overwhelmingly stout.

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:15.900 align:middle line:90%
Picture of health.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:20.610 align:middle line:90%
They wear a blue suit.

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And then they have a jacket
that they wear over it.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And you just need to know that
they have a star right here

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:31.300 align:middle line:90%
on their belt line.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And that was crazy for
him to even tell me that,

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.660 align:middle line:84%
because I was in
Amarillo, Texas.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.550 align:middle line:84%
I hate to say it,
but I was in a mall.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Shopping, I guess.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Anyway--

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Tragic.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah, so I
look through these clothes,

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and I saw this big
old guy over there.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:55.537 align:middle line:84%
And he was wearing the same
thing as what I was told.

00:25:55.537 --> 00:25:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Incredible.

00:25:56.370 --> 00:26:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: And then in turn,
to make sure he acknowledged me,

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.170 align:middle line:90%
I acknowledged him.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And then he opened his coat
and he showed me that star.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.430 align:middle line:90%
And then he walked around.

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:12.200 align:middle line:84%
He was just a
good-looking stout agile.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.840 align:middle line:84%
He had to walk sideways,
he was so stout.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:90%
Just a very stout guy.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.690 align:middle line:84%
As he came around,
I was watching him,

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:22.680 align:middle line:90%
he was watching me.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.790 align:middle line:90%
And he just walked by me.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:26.825 align:middle line:84%
I hate to say this, but
I bumped him on the arm,

00:26:26.825 --> 00:26:28.460 align:middle line:90%
on his shoulder.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's one
stout son of a gun.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:33.260 align:middle line:90%
And he acknowledged me.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:38.360 align:middle line:84%
But his language was
more of a choppy--

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.740 align:middle line:90%
because I was just kidding.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:44.667 align:middle line:84%
I said-- I hate to say this,
but I said, you shop here often?

00:26:44.667 --> 00:26:45.633 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:45.633 --> 00:26:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's great.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: And he
mumbled some words.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:51.860 align:middle line:84%
But his language was he
was trying to answer.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:57.220 align:middle line:84%
But it was more
of a clicky, kind

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:01.098 align:middle line:84%
of like he was trying to
bring it from his deeper--

00:27:01.098 --> 00:27:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Guttural, right.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah.

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And I had heard Jeremiah Davis
talk to those guys on the phone

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:09.460 align:middle line:84%
whenever he'd ask
them questions,

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.230 align:middle line:90%
and they would answer back.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Their language was
more of some kind

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:17.880 align:middle line:90%
of a click type [VOCALIZING].

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know how to explain
it, but it was their language

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:24.130 align:middle line:84%
and Jeremiah had to
learn that language

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with those guys.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.935 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, that's
what they look like.

00:27:29.935 --> 00:27:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you
be a little bit more

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.220 align:middle line:84%
descriptive on this
stout extraterrestrial

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.222 align:middle line:90%
you're speaking of?

00:27:37.222 --> 00:27:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: It would have
been as tall as I am.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.070 align:middle line:90%
I was 6'4".

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:47.960 align:middle line:84%
But his shoulders would be
so thick and so much wider.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:51.410 align:middle line:84%
You know how a
bodybuilder is as far as--

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:54.320 align:middle line:84%
and then his waistline
was not much.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.870 align:middle line:90%
But his legs were just--

00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:59.580 align:middle line:84%
matter of fact, I watched
him walk through the clothes.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And he had to twist and turn
because he wasn't agile.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.700 align:middle line:84%
He was so stout that
he wasn't agile enough.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I feel
like that sometimes.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.180 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:11.090 align:middle line:90%
But he was a rig.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:14.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wouldn't
want to piss him off.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know why
he got my attention.

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know why
he was even there.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:24.980 align:middle line:84%
But I was told about what they
wear a couple of weeks before.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing you know,
they always prove the point.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.400 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's always wild.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, whenever he walked by me,
I was verbally just giggling.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.175 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: But it
wasn't a scary deal.

00:28:39.175 --> 00:28:41.880 align:middle line:84%
You just knew that they're
there for the right reason, not

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.680 align:middle line:90%
the wrong reason.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Right, it
was an awareness.

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Beautiful.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit more about
the clothing he was wearing

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:50.930 align:middle line:90%
and also the badge, the star.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: So the clothing,
it was a very tight one piece,

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:55.910 align:middle line:90%
you might say.

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:58.430 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't a long coat.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:00.980 align:middle line:84%
It was just down there just
a little below his waist.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What color blue?

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: That's
bad about my deal

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.230 align:middle line:90%
is I'm not good with colors.

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:08.630 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't a deep dark blue.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:11.360 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't just a
light blue, either.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.470 align:middle line:90%
And just like saying--

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: He wasn't getting a lot
of attention wearing this one

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.280 align:middle line:90%
piece suit?

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not normal usually for
a bodybuilder to walk around

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.845 align:middle line:90%
in the mall with a--

00:29:19.845 --> 00:29:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: I don't know.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.890 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that
I noticed him.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And everybody else is in their
own little world, I guess.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:28.700 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Maybe he
was cloaking himself

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.062 align:middle line:90%
to everyone else but you.

00:29:31.062 --> 00:29:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: That's an
interesting question,

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.870 align:middle line:84%
because that's such a big
coincidence that you've

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:37.610 align:middle line:90%
been told about this presence.

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And several days
later, I guess, you

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:45.320 align:middle line:84%
see him in the mall,
which is interesting.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Have you gained any
information about that species?

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.020 align:middle line:90%
Is it a human species?

00:29:51.020 --> 00:30:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Or is it cloaked, as Emery said,
like projected a human form

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.828 align:middle line:90%
to the outside?

00:30:01.828 --> 00:30:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: I don't know.

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:04.950 align:middle line:84%
I know when I tapped
him on the shoulder,

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:08.630 align:middle line:84%
he was solid as far
as you talking about--

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:12.140 align:middle line:84%
but he looked just as real
as me or you right now.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now that the
General is not alive anymore,

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:17.018 align:middle line:84%
do you still have communications
with the Galactic Federation?

00:30:17.018 --> 00:30:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Not that I know of.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No?

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: No.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.180 align:middle line:90%
He was pretty well--

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.860 align:middle line:84%
unless they're playing
some other scenario,

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any personal
conversations with anybody

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:28.940 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: But you visited him, or
he visited you in real form,

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.740 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yes.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:36.860 align:middle line:90%
He was a very sick guy.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And what was always strange
to me about this whole deal

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:46.160 align:middle line:84%
was that they have the
capability of curing him, too.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.440 align:middle line:90%
But he didn't want it.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.010 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm tired.

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:54.950 align:middle line:84%
He said, if they
put me in this thing

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:58.370 align:middle line:84%
that they have on the ships,
it takes about a month for them

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:02.330 align:middle line:84%
to really completely rebuild
everything and get rid

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:08.900 align:middle line:84%
of the cancers and the chemicals
that's destroyed your life.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.460 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm just tired.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I could get in that
vat, but he says

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm tired of living
in between two worlds.

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: He said, I'm
living as a human here,

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:22.970 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm living
up here as a general.

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Nobody believes
me here, and they

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.480 align:middle line:84%
don't let me tell anybody
what I really experience.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.920 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I'm just tired.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I've
got to see Christ.

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:35.133 align:middle line:90%
I want to go home.

00:31:35.133 --> 00:31:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You talked about
him getting into this vat.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.010 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell us about that?

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: He never really
said exactly what it was.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:44.680 align:middle line:84%
He said it's a
piece of equipment

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.810 align:middle line:90%
they have on their ships.

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:47.950 align:middle line:90%
You get into it.

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:50.570 align:middle line:84%
I presume they
just knock you out.

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:53.770 align:middle line:84%
But in about a month's
time, you come out.

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you didn't have a
kidney, I guess you got one.

00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:00.100 align:middle line:90%
Or whatever.

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.530 align:middle line:84%
If I understand
that right, that's

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:06.100 align:middle line:84%
how they cure the people that
go into battles that get hurt.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: That's often
referred to as a mat bath.

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:10.528 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You're
absolutely correct.

00:32:10.528 --> 00:32:13.360 align:middle line:90%
I mean, these things do exist.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Do you know if it was a liquid
or a frequency-based plasma?

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: I don't know that.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:23.050 align:middle line:84%
I do know that he brought
up a scenario one time

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:26.770 align:middle line:84%
that they found
a dead spacecraft

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:28.540 align:middle line:90%
out just floating in space.

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And they entered that deal
and they had these capsules.

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:35.780 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember how
many people on there

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.460 align:middle line:84%
that when the craft
was going down,

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.070 align:middle line:84%
they all had to get
into these capsules.

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:41.750 align:middle line:90%
And they go dormant.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, whenever they got there
and found this craft just

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:52.370 align:middle line:84%
floating out in the galaxy, the
people that they saw in there

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:55.520 align:middle line:84%
had been in those capsules
for over a thousand years.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said they
knew with technology

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.160 align:middle line:90%
how to bring most of them back.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And those people were so
shocked that they had missed out

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.610 align:middle line:90%
on a thousand years.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: With your parting words
to the Galactic Federation,

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.900 align:middle line:84%
what do you think their
influence on humanity is?

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: What
Jeremiah told me is we

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.860 align:middle line:90%
need to stop our warring ways.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And then that way, we can go
and live in peace and harmony

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:27.030 align:middle line:84%
with their type of a group
that will be a defense for us

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.800 align:middle line:90%
instead of--

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Destructive.

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah.

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:33.078 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You mentioned for
every experience you have,

00:33:33.078 --> 00:33:34.410 align:middle line:90%
10,000 questions.

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:40.463 align:middle line:84%
What question would you want
answered from your experiences?

00:33:40.463 --> 00:33:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: One of
the biggest ones is--

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and I can't get it
out of my mind--

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.610 align:middle line:84%
is why in the
world somebody that

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:49.460 align:middle line:84%
has absolutely no
experience in any of this,

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:53.590 align:middle line:84%
why would they want a redneck
like me telling this story?

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:55.350 align:middle line:90%
I mean, why?

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:58.390 align:middle line:84%
This is nothing that
you would ever ask for.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:00.670 align:middle line:84%
That's a question you
all have to ask yourself,

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:02.470 align:middle line:84%
because you all have
dealt with this, too.

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:04.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, help me out here.

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: We did.

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And if that helps,
you came across

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:13.340 align:middle line:84%
as such a genuine and
real authentic person.

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:16.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've both
been totally emotional

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.770 align:middle line:90%
and touched from your story.

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.920 align:middle line:90%
So that might be the reason.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Well,
it's a crazy time.

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's collateral
damage to all this.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.540 align:middle line:84%
But it still doesn't
give you the right

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:29.780 align:middle line:90%
not to tell your truth.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: And that's
where it gets bumpy.

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:34.510 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So basically
we're living in one

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:40.150 align:middle line:84%
of the most critical
times ever happened

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:42.550 align:middle line:90%
to humanity and to planet Earth.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:46.870 align:middle line:84%
We've never seen what's
happening currently, also

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:48.880 align:middle line:90%
on the level of disclosure.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that the
Galactic Federation

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:56.050 align:middle line:84%
will step on to Earth and
show themselves publicly?

00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:57.520 align:middle line:90%
And what's their plan?

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Will they help in
some kind of way?

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: I do know
that when there's

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:09.590 align:middle line:84%
been massive droughts and
people starving and everything,

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.960 align:middle line:84%
that they will unload
their equipment

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.270 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of the
mountains and drive it over.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And the people that
are starving don't even

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:20.640 align:middle line:84%
know where it's all coming
from, but it's coming from them.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:26.060 align:middle line:84%
I do know that there's so
many technologies, free energy

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and things like that,
that they talk about.

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:30.690 align:middle line:84%
That I said, well, man,
get us some of that.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And they said, if
you ever fired up,

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Duane, you'll have people at
your house within an hour.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:38.030 align:middle line:90%
Because they monitor all this.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:39.740 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of
their ships, they

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:43.220 align:middle line:84%
have hydrophonics
in these big boys.

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And so in turn, they grow
all the best vegetables,

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:49.470 align:middle line:84%
healthy for everybody
and the whole nine yards.

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:51.323 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, my
gosh, you're out there.

00:35:51.323 --> 00:35:52.490 align:middle line:90%
Where you get all the water?

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Duane,
we make our water

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.770 align:middle line:90%
by the elements around us.

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, how
much water can you make?

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:06.110 align:middle line:90%
He says, we can make rivers run.

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And so, we could clean
up so much stuff.

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:12.170 align:middle line:84%
It would be so
simple if you just--

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Overnight.

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Overnight, yeah.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:19.740 align:middle line:84%
But somebody just doesn't
want that happening, you know?

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Duane, that
was a compelling story.

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: You're welcome.

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And Tim, it's always
great to have you here.

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you.

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.200 align:middle line:84%
