00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Today, on Cosmic Disclosure,
we are with Ricardo Gonzalez,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.940 align:middle line:10%
author and researcher for Peru,
who has experienced multiple

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.920 align:middle line:10%
direct contacts with an
extraterrestrial species called

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.720 align:middle line:10%
the Apunians.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are talking
about consequences

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:90%
of false prophecies.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Ricardo, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>> In pop culture, in
December 21st, 2012,

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:84%
it was prophesied it would
be the end of the world,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.970 align:middle line:90%
but that never culminated.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:84%
But still, people are talking
about that-- this prediction--

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.750 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.830 align:middle line:84%
So what are the consequences
when a prediction doesn't

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.640 align:middle line:90%
come into fruition?

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that the
consequences can be very

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.180 align:middle line:84%
serious because when
information is misinterpreted,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.440 align:middle line:90%
credibility is lost.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And this can lead to
confusion for many people.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.460 align:middle line:84%
In the message we have obtained
through extraterrestrial

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.120 align:middle line:84%
contact, we were always told
that the earth would be living

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.890 align:middle line:84%
a great process
of transformation,

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.790 align:middle line:84%
and this process would affect
both humanity and the planet.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.800 align:middle line:84%
That would lead us to a
higher frequency, so to speak.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:84%
This message, of
course, is real,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.740 align:middle line:84%
but it was misunderstood
by wrongly linking it

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.340 align:middle line:90%
to Mayan prophecies.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:84%
It is true that there
is a common thread

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
between the messages of
the past and the current

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.340 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial experiences,
but we must discern everything

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:90%
we're analyzing from that past.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.020 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans were
quoted as having said

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.630 align:middle line:90%
things which they never said.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.110 align:middle line:84%
This stems from
interpretations from channeling

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.860 align:middle line:84%
a lot of information
unrelated to Mayan history.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.060 align:middle line:84%
This led to many groups who are
enthusiastic about prophecies

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.740 align:middle line:84%
to come to think that the Maya
prophesied an end of the world.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And the Maya and the cultures
that preceded them in Mexico

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.410 align:middle line:90%
never said that.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.290 align:middle line:84%
They had a complex
system of calendars.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Time was an obsession for them.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.000 align:middle line:84%
One of the cycles that
they studied the most

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:84%
is called the Long Count,
lasting 5,125 years.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
that great cycle

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:84%
that the Mayans calculated was
when the Great Transformation

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:90%
was coming.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.400 align:middle line:84%
But what people interpreted
from that cycle was not what

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:90%
the Mayans said.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.420 align:middle line:84%
The end of that cycle coincided
with December 21st, 2012.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And then supposedly, we would
all move to a higher dimension,

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.690 align:middle line:84%
but the prophets of doom
saw in all this, rather,

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.490 align:middle line:84%
the end of the world
by December 21st, 2012.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.940 align:middle line:84%
But I reiterate that
Mayans did not say that.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Their calendars restart
like eternal cycles.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.000 align:middle line:84%
They speak of the end
of a historical cycle

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.930 align:middle line:90%
and the beginning of another.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And it is very important
to understand all this

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.950 align:middle line:84%
in the context of
extraterrestrial contact.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.670 align:middle line:84%
It is very important to
separate authentic information

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.020 align:middle line:90%
from our fantasies.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.380 align:middle line:84%
There are certainly messages
of extraterrestrial origin

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.680 align:middle line:84%
that have spoken of a great
transformation of the world,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.610 align:middle line:84%
but it is wrong to try to
connect all that information.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.670 align:middle line:84%
With misinterpretations
of past history,

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
as happened obviously with Mayan
culture, December 21st, 2012,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.880 align:middle line:84%
we didn't even get to
the fourth dimension,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.040 align:middle line:84%
and the world wasn't
destroyed either.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And this generated
a very deep crisis

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.770 align:middle line:84%
in many extraterrestrial
contact groups, who said,

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.870 align:middle line:84%
this can't be possible,
the Mayans were wrong,

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:84%
or the aliens who contacted us
and announced all this to us

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.170 align:middle line:90%
have lied to us.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And this has
happened at the head

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
contact groups.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.500 align:middle line:90%
And no one talks about this.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.920 align:middle line:84%
It is important to
analyze mistakes.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So I reiterate, first
of all, the Maya never

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.310 align:middle line:84%
mentioned an end of the
world or that we would

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.690 align:middle line:90%
move to a fourth dimension.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And second, these beings from
other worlds, these entities

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.430 align:middle line:84%
that have contacted
us, they only

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.800 align:middle line:84%
told us about a gradual
transformation of the world,

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:84%
related to our
decisions, actions.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And while it is
true that we have

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.470 align:middle line:84%
been asked to investigate
our historical past,

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.230 align:middle line:84%
we shouldn't take
it out of context.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.150 align:middle line:84%
We must investigate
this past rigorously.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Finally, I want to
tell you, Emery,

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:84%
that I value the Mayan
culture very much.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.000 align:middle line:84%
I admit that at first,
I was fascinated

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:84%
by all the information
that circulated

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.490 align:middle line:84%
about the Maya about these
claims of dimensional changes

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.340 align:middle line:84%
and of energy, and of things
that were going to happen,

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.400 align:middle line:84%
but I decided to go
directly to the sources.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.670 align:middle line:84%
I traveled to Mexico,
to Central America.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.010 align:middle line:84%
I tried to soak
up, immerse myself

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.390 align:middle line:84%
in the Mayan culture and
other cultures of Mexico

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.990 align:middle line:84%
to inform myself quite
objectively about all this.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that a lot
of literature about the Maya

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and about their
cosmic connections

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.490 align:middle line:84%
had distorted the legacy of
this fascinating culture that

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.000 align:middle line:84%
had not even been the original
author of the calendars,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.660 align:middle line:84%
but other cultures
such as the Olmecs

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.300 align:middle line:90%
had already worked on it.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.200 align:middle line:84%
So my suggestion to people
who are watching the show

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.220 align:middle line:84%
is that they question
everything, investigate sources

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:84%
in depth because this is the
best way to get to the truth

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and thus also understand
the current messages

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.200 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrial
contact witnesses.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing, Ricardo.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I always tell people, go out
and find out for yourself,

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:90%
like you did.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's a wonderful story
you've just told us.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.150 align:middle line:84%
What are the danger of
these fanatical groups that

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.590 align:middle line:84%
try to predict these world
events based upon the phenomena

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:90%
that they hear?

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many
dangers, my friend.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.190 align:middle line:84%
On one hand, as I said,
the disinformation,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.570 align:middle line:84%
that can confuse true seekers
and take away credibility

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.720 align:middle line:84%
from this profound
issue, as is the message

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:84%
of entities of other worlds,
extraterrestrial contact,

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.470 align:middle line:84%
and obviously, the legacy
of ancient civilizations.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.030 align:middle line:84%
But there is more to
that danger of confusion.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.300 align:middle line:84%
This can even lead to
putting your own life at risk

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.900 align:middle line:84%
because there are many groups
that take this to the extreme,

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.220 align:middle line:84%
violently, who in the
face of external events

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.940 align:middle line:84%
such as an eclipse, or
the appearance of a comet,

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.510 align:middle line:84%
or the fulfillment of
the Mayan calendar,

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.330 align:middle line:84%
they make crazy decisions
about their own lives,

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:84%
or they hold meetings with
extremely strange practices

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.870 align:middle line:84%
transforming this into an
almost religious situation.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:10%
For example, in the
place where I live,

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:10%
which is a very special and
famous area in the world,

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.000 align:middle line:10%
and I mean Uritorco
Hill in Argentina--

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.780 align:middle line:10%
which is the scene of
constant UFO sightings--

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.990 align:middle line:10%
the authorities of
the town of Uritorco

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.790 align:middle line:10%
had to close down the Mountain
on December 21st, 2012

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.600 align:middle line:10%
because many spiritual groups,
as well as many different types

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.930 align:middle line:10%
of groups, were going to gather
there waiting for the Great

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.340 align:middle line:10%
Transformation.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Many of these groups
had good intentions,

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.610 align:middle line:84%
but there were also some
small infiltrated groups

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:07.000 align:middle line:84%
who acted like factions
with violent intentions

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.230 align:middle line:84%
so the mountain
had to be closed.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And these things happen in
extraterrestrial contact.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Almost no one talks
about this, and that's

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.140 align:middle line:84%
why we're chatting about
it in this interview.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Because while it is
true the contact is real

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:84%
and the messages are
positive and extraordinary,

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:90%
we humans can confuse things.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And it is good to
warn the public who

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.990 align:middle line:84%
is watching this
program to be sensible

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.309 align:middle line:84%
and balanced with
this information.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So how can someone
distinguish between fanaticism

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.440 align:middle line:90%
and passionate truth seekers?

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>> According to my experience
and what I've seen in the world

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:84%
over so many years, the best
way to distinguish among these

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:56.690 align:middle line:84%
extremes is when people maintain
their balance, their reasoning,

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:01.760 align:middle line:84%
without falling into very rigid
postures where their beliefs

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.710 align:middle line:84%
cannot be questioned, where they
lose their critical thinking,

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.230 align:middle line:84%
where they stop
thinking, discerning.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:13.190 align:middle line:84%
This is when these experiences
of extraterrestrial contact

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.680 align:middle line:84%
or any information
that comes from it

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.770 align:middle line:84%
is taken almost in
a religious way,

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.110 align:middle line:90%
and this leads to fanaticism.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.660 align:middle line:84%
The best way to
discern all of this

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:27.370 align:middle line:84%
is through thinking
it over and also

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:31.690 align:middle line:84%
what resonates in your
heart, but combining both

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:84%
what you feel and
what you perceive.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.500 align:middle line:84%
The power of intuition-- if
we want to call it that--

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.220 align:middle line:84%
without setting aside the
mind and common sense,

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.830 align:middle line:84%
trying to be rigorous
with everything,

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.920 align:middle line:84%
you will agree with me,
Emery, that these issues

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.650 align:middle line:84%
that we live and investigate
are very delicate, sensitive.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:57.880 align:middle line:84%
All this information must be
taken very calmly, observed

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.800 align:middle line:84%
very carefully, and not
become a fanatic about them.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:09.310 align:middle line:84%
If we set aside the ability
to think, to analyze,

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.550 align:middle line:84%
we can fall into
the wrong attitude.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.400 align:middle line:90%
These issues are not religion.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.610 align:middle line:84%
They are information that
opens the consciousness.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And to open the mind, you have
to ask yourself questions.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:27.350 align:middle line:84%
If you stop asking questions
of yourself, you will be lost.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the significant
influences in the United States

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.810 align:middle line:84%
that you could talk
to our audience about?

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Dorothy Martin was a very
interesting character in US

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.680 align:middle line:10%
contactism.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:45.100 align:middle line:10%
On one hand, for the grave
mistake that she made.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.470 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, for
information for which

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:84%
she was a pioneer in this
country and around the world.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with the mistake.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.430 align:middle line:84%
She announced with her Chicago
extraterrestrial contact group

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:01.300 align:middle line:84%
that a great flood was going
to occur in the United States

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.900 align:middle line:84%
and affect countries like
Canada and even Mexico.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:84%
This was allegedly an
extraterrestrial message

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:11.740 align:middle line:90%
predicting a catastrophe.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And all this came out in
the newspapers, Emery.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle line:84%
The flood was to happen
December 21st, 1954.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So since all this
came out in the media,

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:28.390 align:middle line:84%
a group of psychologists
infiltrated Dorothy Marten's

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.060 align:middle line:84%
group to study the
group's beliefs

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.930 align:middle line:84%
from within, their
contact methodology,

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:37.570 align:middle line:84%
how they became convinced
that this disaster was

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:38.690 align:middle line:90%
going to happen.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:40.870 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the
most interesting

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.310 align:middle line:90%
psychological studies--

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.220 align:middle line:84%
how an extraterrestrial
contact group works.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:51.160 align:middle line:10%
Their beliefs seen from within
by these psychologists who

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.390 align:middle line:10%
were led by Dr. Leon Festinger.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the
flood did not occur,

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.100 align:middle line:84%
and this generated a
crisis in the group

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.680 align:middle line:84%
because the prophecy
was not fulfilled.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And the group wondered, with
its leader, Dorothy Martin,

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.920 align:middle line:90%
at the head, what went wrong?

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Did the extraterrestrials
lie to us

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.620 align:middle line:84%
or did we misinterpret
the message?

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Psychologists called this
phenomenon disconfirmation.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And when this happens
within contact groups,

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.790 align:middle line:90%
great confusion occurs.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:28.960 align:middle line:84%
From this experience came the
book "When Prophecy Fails."

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And this greatly
affected witnesses

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
contact in the 1950s.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:40.450 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about the time of
George Adamski, of Daniel Fry,

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:10%
or Howard Menger.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:46.470 align:middle line:10%
However, Dorothy
Martin moved forward

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.900 align:middle line:10%
and she befriended
another contact witness,

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.260 align:middle line:10%
researcher George Hunt
Williamson, a personal friend

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.270 align:middle line:10%
of George Adamski.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:84%
She continued receiving
messages and traveled to Peru

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.510 align:middle line:84%
to research many
places of contact.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense,
Dorothy Martin

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:07.390 align:middle line:84%
was a pioneer because many of
the places that she researched

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:11.920 align:middle line:84%
in Peru, decades later, would
be transformed into famous sites

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.260 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial contact.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Then she returned to
the United States.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.330 align:middle line:90%
All this in the 1950s.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And she started meeting with her
contact groups on Mount Shasta

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:84%
and in Sedona, anticipating
that there would be much contact

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.915 align:middle line:90%
movement in these areas.

00:13:28.915 --> 00:13:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>> What did she say why
she failed on the prophecy?

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there was a big
mistake with Dorothy Martin,

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.850 align:middle line:84%
where possible real
extraterrestrial messages from

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:46.410 align:middle line:84%
her own personal experiences
were mixed with her religious

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.880 align:middle line:90%
beliefs.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Her misinterpretations
of their messages--

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.130 align:middle line:84%
from what the group
of psychologists who

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:90%
studied this group discovered--

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.540 align:middle line:84%
is that the group
became very passionate

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:01.530 align:middle line:84%
about the information and
mixed all their beliefs

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.300 align:middle line:84%
with the messages that
they thought they received.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:08.130 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
Dorothy Martin's group

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:12.900 align:middle line:84%
lost sight of common sense,
the ability to analyze.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And from this, came
that disconfirmation.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And this phenomenon with
Dorothy Martin's group

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.800 align:middle line:84%
didn't just happen with the
contact groups of the 1950s,

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.560 align:middle line:84%
but it continues
to happen today.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.390 align:middle line:84%
When there are disconfirmations,
messages from extraterrestrials

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:84%
that are not fulfilled, groups
try not to recognize them,

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.930 align:middle line:84%
not to accept them, and
they become fanatical

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.050 align:middle line:90%
about all this.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And they tried to move
on despite that mistake.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:47.010 align:middle line:84%
The best advice in
these circumstances

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:52.350 align:middle line:84%
is to stop and
analyze what happened,

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.590 align:middle line:84%
so as to not make the
same mistake again.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.100 align:middle line:84%
A mistake that not only affects
you and your contact link

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.190 align:middle line:84%
with beings from other
worlds but can affect

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.230 align:middle line:90%
other people who listen to you.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is still happening
in many contact groups today.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.590 align:middle line:84%
That is the importance
of discerning.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any examples right
now that are hurting or helping

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.300 align:middle line:90%
disclosure that's out there?

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I wouldn't dare give specific
names because this is a very

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.120 align:middle line:90%
delicate subject.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And I consider that all the
information that I just shared

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.480 align:middle line:84%
will be enough for the
people who are watching us

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:90%
to be organized and discerning.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.910 align:middle line:84%
However, I could
mention the following.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:39.810 align:middle line:90%
There are intelligence teams--

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.990 align:middle line:84%
even if it sounds like
a conspiracy theory--

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:46.570 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they have intervened
in extraterrestrial contact

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:47.370 align:middle line:90%
groups.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.980 align:middle line:84%
They have infiltrated
them and they've

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.320 align:middle line:84%
tried to lead them
down the wrong path

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.250 align:middle line:84%
because, in their view, somehow,
extraterrestrial contact

00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:01.230 align:middle line:84%
groups are an uncomfortable
social movement that bothers

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:84%
certain power
groups in the world

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.540 align:middle line:84%
because there are many
witnesses on the planet that

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.360 align:middle line:84%
are talking about contact
with other realities.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:14.440 align:middle line:84%
So if they're able to lead these
groups down the wrong paths,

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.760 align:middle line:84%
they take away
their credibility.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So secret intelligence
agencies somehow

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.830 align:middle line:84%
are able to infiltrate these
extraterrestrial contact

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:29.740 align:middle line:84%
groups to influence them and
lead them down the wrong path.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:34.270 align:middle line:84%
As I said, it is a tool used
to confuse and to affect

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:37.810 align:middle line:84%
the credibility of this social
movement of contact witnesses

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:38.980 align:middle line:90%
across the globe.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, it must be said that
much of this confusion--

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.500 align:middle line:84%
as in the case of
Dorothy Martin--

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:49.700 align:middle line:84%
occurs by their very
nature because humans can

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:90%
be confused by this fanaticism.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And if we add to that,
a program of confusion,

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.050 align:middle line:90%
it is the perfect weapon.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So how about the positive
things that came out of Dorothy

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Martin's experiences?

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Obviously,
despite her mistakes,

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.860 align:middle line:84%
many positive things may be
taken from the case of Dorothy

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:08.660 align:middle line:90%
Martin.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.710 align:middle line:84%
One of them, as I said, is
that she kept investigating.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:14.660 align:middle line:84%
She traveled to
different places that we

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.640 align:middle line:84%
could call hotspots,
places of contact,

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.280 align:middle line:90%
which gave them visibility.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And today, there are sites
of ufological investigations

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.740 align:middle line:90%
or extraterrestrial contact.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.010 align:middle line:84%
For example, today,
many groups who attempt

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.100 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial contact
in the United States,

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:34.890 align:middle line:84%
such as the CFI
protocol, for example.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:38.240 align:middle line:84%
In Latin America, it is
known already by another name

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:84%
because it is very old
and has always happened.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:45.440 align:middle line:84%
These groups trying to make
contacts in the United States

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.980 align:middle line:84%
are going to places that Dorothy
Martin had already investigated

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:52.940 align:middle line:84%
in exactly the same places
where Dorothy Martin was

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.870 align:middle line:90%
70 years ago.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And these people are
having their own experiences.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Obviously, each person
lives their own experiences.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.200 align:middle line:84%
There is a legacy of
the contact witnesses

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:84%
from the 1950s like George
Adamski or Dorothy Martin.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Some made contact in a more
classical nature in ufology.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Face-to-face contact with
human-looking entities

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:20.470 align:middle line:84%
like the contact
Adamski himself claimed.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And there are contact witnesses
of a more spiritual or mystical

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.530 align:middle line:90%
nature like Dorothy Martin.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:30.340 align:middle line:84%
For that reason, those who
follow a more mystical line,

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:34.600 align:middle line:84%
what we could call new age,
ignore the classic cases

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.650 align:middle line:90%
of ufology.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And those who follow the
classic cases of ufology

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:84%
ignore the experience
of Dorothy Martin

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:42.940 align:middle line:90%
and many others like her.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.730 align:middle line:84%
But for me, everything
is connected.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And in both types, there
were mistakes and successes.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Those of us who live
these experiences

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.160 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
contact today

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.520 align:middle line:84%
have to make rational
use of these experiences

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.710 align:middle line:84%
that the history of
extraterrestrial contact

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:03.100 align:middle line:84%
has taught us, as well as
our own personal contact

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.640 align:middle line:84%
story, to avoid making
the same mistakes,

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.430 align:middle line:84%
to be as balanced and
sensible as possible

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:11.560 align:middle line:90%
with this information.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Emery, I look at
extraterrestrial contact

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:15.730 align:middle line:90%
like a tree.

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:84%
You have to see it
for what it is--

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:21.070 align:middle line:84%
as a tree-- not decorate
it and put things on it

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:84%
like a Christmas tree because
if we put so many things

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.850 align:middle line:84%
and lights on it, suddenly,
we stop seeing the tree.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And here, our focus
is on the tree.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you give us an example of
a prophecy that was manipulated

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.480 align:middle line:90%
for a specific agenda?

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I could cite different cases.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I could mention, once again,
the prophecy for the year 2012,

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.600 align:middle line:84%
which was not a prophecy,
in and of itself,

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.010 align:middle line:90%
as we would interpret it.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:84%
To take out of context the true
message of ancient cultures,

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:58.390 align:middle line:84%
we saw many films, documentaries
about the destruction

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:01.660 align:middle line:84%
that the Maya would
have falsely prophesied.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And fear invaded the
cinema, invaded magazines,

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:07.270 align:middle line:90%
and invaded everything.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.760 align:middle line:84%
But I will give you a
more concrete example

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.850 align:middle line:84%
of an extraterrestrial
contact group.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:16.720 align:middle line:10%
In 1975, in California,
an alleged contact witness

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.040 align:middle line:10%
emerged.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.330 align:middle line:10%
I'm referring to the
case of Mr. Applewhite.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, he was
having supposed experiences

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:29.070 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials
until he formed a contact

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:33.600 align:middle line:84%
group in California,
which he called The Crew.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And he was convinced that
something extraordinary

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:90%
was going to happen in 1997.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:84%
A prophecy of a
great transformation

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.560 align:middle line:84%
that coincided with the passage
of a comet near the Earth,

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Hale-Bopp comet.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.030 align:middle line:10%
And Applewhite, with
his passengers--

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.490 align:middle line:10%
as he called the members
of his contact group--

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:10%
believed the comet was an
extraterrestrial craft,

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.500 align:middle line:10%
so they decided to
take their own lives

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.520 align:middle line:10%
so that their souls could
travel to the comet, allegedly,

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.560 align:middle line:10%
the extraterrestrial spacecraft.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:09.240 align:middle line:84%
The press called this incident
the Heaven's Gate case.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there are
many related cases.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.200 align:middle line:84%
According to my
research, we're looking

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.670 align:middle line:84%
at a case of imbalanced
people who misinterpreted

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:23.960 align:middle line:84%
an alleged extraterrestrial
contact, and at the same time,

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.440 align:middle line:84%
they were infiltrated as
part of an experiment.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.110 align:middle line:84%
What were the
consequences of all this?

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:33.710 align:middle line:84%
How far can a group's
beliefs be manipulated

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.390 align:middle line:90%
to get them to take their lives?

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand, how
may sordid news like this

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.940 align:middle line:84%
affect the credibility of
contact with extraterrestrials?

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.220 align:middle line:84%
All these people who
talk about contact

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:52.740 align:middle line:84%
with beings from other
worlds, they're crazy.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.330 align:middle line:90%
They are part of UFO cults.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.230 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
plan to lump all

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.410 align:middle line:84%
the witnesses in the same
box, in the same category.

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:05.140 align:middle line:84%
This occurs in all
aspects of human life,

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.570 align:middle line:90%
just like in politics.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And believe me that
extraterrestrial contact

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:13.300 align:middle line:84%
is an issue that worries
politicians a lot,

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.400 align:middle line:84%
even if they don't
say it openly.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>> How are ETs affecting
these prophecies?

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.600 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>> In reality, these beings seek
to warn us of possibilities,

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:28.250 align:middle line:84%
at least in my own
contact experience.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.740 align:middle line:84%
They are not blunt,
immovable, and saying,

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:34.670 align:middle line:84%
this is going to happen
in the history of mankind.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:38.240 align:middle line:84%
They often tell us,
this could happen.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.160 align:middle line:84%
If you don't change or
make better decisions,

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.800 align:middle line:90%
this could happen.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.650 align:middle line:84%
According to our analysis,
we calculated that it

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.920 align:middle line:90%
could occur in this time frame.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.380 align:middle line:84%
These are the most personal
circumstances of contact.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.570 align:middle line:84%
They've been a
little more specific.

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.380 align:middle line:84%
For example, when I've invited
journalists or researchers

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.330 align:middle line:90%
to UFO sightings--

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.970 align:middle line:84%
a topic we've already
discussed in other interviews

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:03.290 align:middle line:90%
with you, Emery--

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:06.950 align:middle line:84%
there, these beings gave
us the exact place and time

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.810 align:middle line:84%
when a phenomenon
was going to occur.

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:13.670 align:middle line:84%
We could interpret
this as a prophecy

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:15.560 align:middle line:84%
because they said
we're going to be

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.500 align:middle line:84%
on Mount Shasta on this
date, at this time.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And they were, and
they never failed.

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And in the presence of
several researchers.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:28.160 align:middle line:84%
But we are already talking about
a global event for the Earth,

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.360 align:middle line:90%
for humanity.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.450 align:middle line:84%
There are other circumstances
at play, naturally,

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.660 align:middle line:90%
and anything is possible.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.950 align:middle line:84%
They try to intervene in
some way in our affairs,

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:44.670 align:middle line:84%
but not directly,
only peripherally.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.580 align:middle line:84%
As we've also discussed
in other interviews,

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:84%
they prefer to hand
over information

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and stimulate our
search so that we

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:84%
are the protagonists of the
things that we should do,

00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:00.000 align:middle line:84%
in order to be able to
change the prophecies.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.740 align:middle line:84%
What does the word
prophecy mean?

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.540 align:middle line:90%
It means to speak instead of.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And for some, that
instead of is of God

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:84%
speaking instead of
the universe, speaking

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.880 align:middle line:90%
instead of something higher.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Or could it be that
what humans call

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:19.415 align:middle line:84%
prophecies are just perceptions
of timelines in the future?

00:24:19.415 --> 00:24:22.150 align:middle line:90%


00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.660 align:middle line:90%
How does this work?

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine a
mountain, and there

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:30.490 align:middle line:90%
is a path that surrounds it.

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:35.170 align:middle line:84%
On one side, a sports car
is coming at a high speed.

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And from the other side of the
mountain, a truck is coming.

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Both drivers do
not know that they

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:44.110 align:middle line:84%
are going to have an accident
on the mountain curve.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:47.210 align:middle line:84%
When they are both on the
curve, it will be too late

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:49.320 align:middle line:90%
and they will hit each other.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:54.480 align:middle line:84%
If we watch from a privileged
view, from above, in the air,

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.890 align:middle line:84%
with an eagle eye, we
could calculate or predict

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:00.990 align:middle line:84%
that this accident
is going to happen.

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:03.390 align:middle line:84%
but we can see
that from the air.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:05.610 align:middle line:90%
The drivers cannot see it.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:07.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's how prophecies work.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:12.690 align:middle line:84%
These are possibilities, views
from another perspective.

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:16.670 align:middle line:84%
If the drivers slow down
and are more careful,

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:21.260 align:middle line:84%
they could avoid the
accident, and that prophecy

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.550 align:middle line:90%
would no longer be fulfilled.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:27.970 align:middle line:84%
At least, this is the concept
from the extraterrestrials

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:29.690 align:middle line:90%
who are in contact with me.

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:34.240 align:middle line:84%
They say we must work for what
we call positive prophecies,

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and that we must work so
that those predictions that

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:41.200 align:middle line:84%
would be negative for our
species are not fulfilled.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's not the
prophecies that fail.

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.660 align:middle line:84%
What fails is our
perception when

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.840 align:middle line:84%
we misunderstand
these things and we

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.790 align:middle line:90%
stop doing our real work.

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:53.450 align:middle line:84%

was amazing stuff.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.510 align:middle line:84%

being on the show.

>> How have contact protocols
changed over the centuries?

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>> These protocols follow
a very particular pattern.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:17.520 align:middle line:84%
It is based on awareness,
intuition, and the ability

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.550 align:middle line:90%
to elevate our frequency.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:23.220 align:middle line:84%
In reality, these
protocols are not

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:27.270 align:middle line:84%
designed to be common
knowledge for humanity.

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:30.430 align:middle line:84%
So it is important to understand
that this is not a game, not

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:31.230 align:middle line:90%
entertainment.
