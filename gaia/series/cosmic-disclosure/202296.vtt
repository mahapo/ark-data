00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.790 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.770 align:middle line:10%
we are with Richard Doty,
a retired special agent who

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.440 align:middle line:10%
has served in the
Air Force Office

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.620 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations
and was intimately involved

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.080 align:middle line:10%
with UFO ET-related content.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Richard.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD DOTY: Thank you.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, you had direct
access to these reports

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.740 align:middle line:84%
in the 1980s, where you learned
about several different ET

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.060 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Could you elaborate
on that for me?

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: I was briefed
into Project Amber Sun, which

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.350 align:middle line:84%
was an investigation of captured
extraterrestrial creatures

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.990 align:middle line:84%
we received by the
use of military

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.460 align:middle line:84%
or by the US
intelligence service.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And the first one that I had
access to was a Trantaloid.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And that was the one I spoke
about some time ago having

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.820 align:middle line:84%
escaped from Papoose
Lake Complex Alpha.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.690 align:middle line:90%
The second one is a Quadloid.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Quadloid was another
creature that we knew

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.270 align:middle line:90%
and we had at Papoose Lake.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.420 align:middle line:90%
The third one was an Eben.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.220 align:middle line:10%
A Eben, of course,
is Eba one, Eba two,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.700 align:middle line:10%
the same alien race that
crashed at Roswell in 1947.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth one
is the Nordics.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.480 align:middle line:84%
The Nordics are the dangerous
ones, the hostile ones,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.050 align:middle line:84%
the ones that we kept a
close eye on, so to speak.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.310 align:middle line:84%
But the problem we had with
the extraterrestrial races,

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:84%
if we hadn't captured
them, we didn't really

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:90%
know how they operated.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.130 align:middle line:84%
There were probably
others visiting

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Earth now and then
or more frequently

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.280 align:middle line:90%
that we couldn't keep track of.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And those are the ones
that we had to worry about.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.090 align:middle line:90%
There's one other race.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:90%
It's the Greys.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:90%
It's different from the Ebens.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.670 align:middle line:84%
The Greys are the
ones that you see

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.370 align:middle line:90%
in pictures on the internet.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:84%
They can be hostile at times,
but that's the fifth race.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And are some of these
organic Greys also programmed

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.200 align:middle line:84%
lifeforms, half
AI, half organic?

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yes, they are.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.730 align:middle line:90%
They call them humanoid robots.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Their textures and their
bodies are of a human,

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.780 align:middle line:90%
but they were actually robotics.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think there
was an actual Grey

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.060 align:middle line:84%
race that cloned these
robotic types that I was told

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.220 align:middle line:90%
or I read into.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.370 align:middle line:84%
But that's pretty much all
I knew about the Greys.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was the
location of these species?

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.580 align:middle line:90%
Where did they find them?

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Was it off planet, on planet?

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.235 align:middle line:90%
How did we acquire them?

00:02:54.235 --> 00:02:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They're
all on planet.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.000 align:middle line:84%
There were crash sites,
a number of crash sites

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.400 align:middle line:84%
around the United
States and Canada.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.120 align:middle line:84%
We found the crafts, and
then we found the creatures

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.040 align:middle line:84%
either inside or
outside the craft.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how do these
ETs communicate with us?

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, as
far as communications

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.960 align:middle line:84%
first between each
other, I think

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.620 align:middle line:84%
there is some communications
and some cooperation

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.370 align:middle line:84%
between the Trantaloids
and the Quadloids.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.110 align:middle line:90%
I think there is.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:84%
I've read where there
was cooperation.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.770 align:middle line:84%
The Trantaloids,
they didn't speak.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:84%
They used telepathy
as did the Quadloids.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.957 align:middle line:84%
The reptilians, they
could speak some English.

00:03:39.957 --> 00:03:40.790 align:middle line:90%
They could voice it.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.020 align:middle line:84%
It was very difficult for the
Americans to understand it,

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.240 align:middle line:84%
but if they got
real close to them,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.673 align:middle line:84%
the abductees told me
they could understand

00:03:48.673 --> 00:03:49.590 align:middle line:90%
what they were saying.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was it like
a whisper or a growl?

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:90%
Or was it like us?

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Is it a deep voice?

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.972 align:middle line:90%
A high squelch?

00:03:54.972 --> 00:03:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: More like a growl.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mm-hmm.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.018 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: More like a growl.

00:03:58.018 --> 00:04:02.020 align:middle line:84%
The Ebens, of course,
they learned English.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And some of them had
a voice box planted,

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.080 align:middle line:84%
so they could understand
and speak and communicate.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And the Greys, it
was all telepathy.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.090 align:middle line:90%
They didn't speak any.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't
think the Greys--

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.589 align:middle line:84%
ever heard of Greys making any
sounds but high-pitch squeaks.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:23.180 align:middle line:90%
The Nordics could speak English.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.250 align:middle line:84%
They could imitate English
and other languages, not just

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.050 align:middle line:90%
English.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were
instances that I

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.080 align:middle line:84%
knew about where they spoke
Spanish from along the US

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.390 align:middle line:90%
border and the Mexico border.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.070 align:middle line:84%
I've heard of instances
where they spoke German.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And to a person in the United
States but of German descent,

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.330 align:middle line:84%
they spoke German
to that person.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.840 align:middle line:84%
So they could speak languages,
English and other languages.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you break
it down, each one of them,

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.050 align:middle line:84%
to what they looked like,
their customs, and what

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.730 align:middle line:90%
is their mission?

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, I just
know what they look like.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.450 align:middle line:84%
The Trantaloids are the
praying mantis type.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And I believe there are some
different sizes, not just

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.083 align:middle line:90%
the real tall ones.

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Their nourishment's
different than ours,

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.960 align:middle line:84%
so their bodies are
very, very slender.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Other than Ebens, I don't
believe any of the others

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.860 align:middle line:84%
actually consume our
type of nourishment.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.730 align:middle line:90%
But the Ebens can.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:84%
The Ebens can eat our food
and limited mostly vegetables.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.640 align:middle line:84%
All these five races,
they can breathe our air.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.862 align:middle line:84%
The Greys-- I know very
little about the Greys.

00:05:30.862 --> 00:05:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And I know very little
about the Nordics.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Although, they are
the tall humanoids.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:84%
They look like Swedes or
Norwegians or Nordics.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.830 align:middle line:90%
And they're the hostile type.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.700 align:middle line:84%
The Quadloids are
somewhat hideous looking.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.100 align:middle line:84%
They're tall,
long-faced, deep eyes.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.318 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is this the
reptilian race they speak of?

00:05:52.318 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yes, they are.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.730 align:middle line:84%
They have the reptilian
skin, reptilian-looking head,

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.540 align:middle line:84%
the same skin on their body
that's on their head and face,

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.960 align:middle line:90%
and they have complicated eyes.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.980 align:middle line:90%
They do have a nose.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.720 align:middle line:90%
They can breathe our air.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Their mouth is small.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And they have two openings
for ears inside their head.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.870 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones
that are, we think,

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.290 align:middle line:84%
abducting more people than
any other alien races,

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.490 align:middle line:90%
the reptilians.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.930 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that
scare the most people.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.548 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Where are they from?

00:06:26.548 --> 00:06:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: I'm not sure
where they're from.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And why do you
think they're visiting us?

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Space exploration.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And I believe they're
harvesting our female eggs.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
harvesting our male sperm.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.390 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
trying to manipulate

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.400 align:middle line:90%
and trying to create clones.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you ever read
any document or briefing

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.880 align:middle line:90%
that has stated that?

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yes, I did.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And was that
through OSI or who?

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: That was
through Amber Sun.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.462 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Amber Sun Project?

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Project Amber Sun.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They had a
small paragraph for each.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And they believe--
even in the 50s.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the
80s, they believed

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.920 align:middle line:84%
that the reptilians
were the ones that

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.210 align:middle line:84%
were doing most of the
abductions trying to manipulate

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.190 align:middle line:90%
the DNA of humans.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you ever
interview any civilians

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.708 align:middle line:84%
that were abducted by
the reptilian race?

00:07:24.708 --> 00:07:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Yes, I interviewed
a couple that were.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there
anything that stood out

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.330 align:middle line:90%
you could share with us?

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They were more
aggressive towards the human.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.940 align:middle line:90%
They were very mean.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.650 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't harm them.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.180 align:middle line:84%
The people that I interviewed--
and it was only two of them,

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.380 align:middle line:90%
abductees--

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.070 align:middle line:90%
they weren't harmed in any way.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And what they did to them,
they quickly healed them.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.350 align:middle line:84%
But they were very
mean-spirited.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.220 align:middle line:90%
They were very rough with them.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:84%
But they never permanently
harmed any of them.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did these abductees
ever talk about smells

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.640 align:middle line:90%
from this race?

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yes.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.290 align:middle line:90%
They were horrible smelling.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.840 align:middle line:84%
The reptilians were
like a pungent odor--

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Putrid.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: --that they couldn't
ever forget or alleviate.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.970 align:middle line:90%
It was just horrible smelling.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.355 align:middle line:84%
They think that the smell
was emanating from the body.

00:08:24.355 --> 00:08:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do they
have the ability

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.370 align:middle line:84%
to shape-shift,
these reptilians?

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: I don't know.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.340 align:middle line:90%
I've never thought of that.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.802 align:middle line:84%
I never read anything where
they could shape-shift.

00:08:34.802 --> 00:08:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you
heard of anything

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.159 align:middle line:84%
like they have special
psionic abilities to mind

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:45.345 align:middle line:84%
control leaders of power
and influential people

00:08:45.345 --> 00:08:46.145 align:middle line:90%
in your briefings?

00:08:46.145 --> 00:08:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: I think they could.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:84%
But the Nordics were more
apt at doing that as I read.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.920 align:middle line:84%
I didn't read about any
other race manipulating

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.360 align:middle line:90%
the human mind but the Nordics.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.670 align:middle line:84%
The Nordics, it was
reported they could

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:02.803 align:middle line:90%
manipulate the human mind.

00:09:02.803 --> 00:09:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Would you
say the Nordics

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.920 align:middle line:84%
are more advanced than
the reptilian race?

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: I would say yes.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.860 align:middle line:90%
They trick people.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:84%
They tricked the people
thinking that they're humans.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And then one particular
abductee told me

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.130 align:middle line:84%
she was thoroughly
convinced this guy was

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:26.630 align:middle line:84%
going to be her lover for life,
and then he changed appearance.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.370 align:middle line:90%
And she was scared to death.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And he told her in
pure English, you're

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:84%
going to be mine forever, but
not in the way you want to be.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.652 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:09:36.652 --> 00:09:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: They could change.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yeah.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.380 align:middle line:90%
They could change appearances.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And she was abducted, and
she was continuously being

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.720 align:middle line:90%
abducted by that same Nordic.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you do
any testing on her?

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: I think we put her
in hypnosis, but that was it.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how do you
decipher between who--

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.783 align:middle line:84%
there's so many
abductees out there.

00:09:57.783 --> 00:09:58.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how do you decipher?

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Is it just because of
if it has something

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.080 align:middle line:84%
to do with national security,
then you were called in,

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and then you investigate
this civilian?

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well,
she was a civilian,

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:84%
but she was a wife of
an Air Force captain.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's why we got involved.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Almost all our investigations
into abductions on people

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.770 align:middle line:84%
are-- they have to have some
connection to the military

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.030 align:middle line:84%
or to the intelligence
community.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:25.350 align:middle line:84%
But she was-- this one
was a captain's wife.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And she had horrible,
horrible encounters with this.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.120 align:middle line:90%
And she was believable.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.960 align:middle line:90%
She was believable.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You believe she
was telling the truth.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yes, yes.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.302 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, we've been
talking about the Nordics now.

00:10:38.302 --> 00:10:40.260 align:middle line:84%
I know something happened
in Russia over there.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Could you please tell
me what that's about?

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, in 1982,
there was an incident south

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:84%
of Moscow, where a craft
landed and abducted

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:90%
some schoolchildren.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And we, the US intelligence,
knew some things about it.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know
everything about it.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Some of our deep cover agents
inside Moscow heard about it,

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.360 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't
know more about it.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.740 align:middle line:84%
So US intelligence
launched an operation

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.810 align:middle line:90%
to try to gather more evidence.

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:90%
And we did.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:15.720 align:middle line:84%
We were able to contact
the right people,

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.690 align:middle line:84%
get our assets into
the right location.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And the person,
a police officer,

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.350 align:middle line:84%
a Russian police officer who
witnessed this and actually

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.600 align:middle line:84%
chased the craft
in his vehicle--

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.820 align:middle line:90%
although the craft flew away--

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.070 align:middle line:84%
was able to provide
us more information.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:35.070 align:middle line:84%
The children were
recovered sometime later,

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.960 align:middle line:90%
about four or five days later.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.740 align:middle line:84%
They recovered at a location
hundreds of kilometers

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.230 align:middle line:84%
away from where
they were abducted.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And Brezhnev was the premier for
the Soviet Union at the time.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And he ordered the military,
the Air Defense Force,

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:84%
to shoot down any
kind of aircraft

00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:01.110 align:middle line:84%
that was spotted over the Soviet
Union that wasn't identified.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
up near Siberia,

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.090 align:middle line:84%
the Russians shot down a craft
similar to the one abducted.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:12.570 align:middle line:90%
And in that craft were Nordics.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.350 align:middle line:90%
We found out about that--

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:15.770 align:middle line:84%
found out about
it after the fact.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: It was always after
the fact that we found it out.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.990 align:middle line:84%
So the Russians are
experienced the same things

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:26.120 align:middle line:84%
that we are experienced
at least with the Nordics.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's one
incident I know about.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is
the relationship now

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
with these five
species that we have?

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well,
when I left in '88,

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:39.050 align:middle line:84%
we had a good relationship
with the Ebens.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And we had somewhat a working
relationship with the others.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.590 align:middle line:84%
But we couldn't control
them unless we captured one.

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And they were so far
advanced in technology

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.130 align:middle line:84%
that there's just no way we
could keep track of them,

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.640 align:middle line:84%
so they did pretty much
what they wanted to do.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
the Ebens said--

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Eba two told us was, we're
not abducting anyone.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Everyone that we
visit are volunteers.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:12.740 align:middle line:84%
So if the Ebens are-- and I'm
sure they are making contact

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.390 align:middle line:90%
secretly with humans--

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.910 align:middle line:90%
it's not so much an abduction.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:20.510 align:middle line:84%
It's more or less a volunteer,
volunteering their bodies

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.250 align:middle line:90%
for research.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if they're
witting or unwitting in that

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.800 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.258 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are
the relationships

00:13:30.258 --> 00:13:33.140 align:middle line:84%
with these five types of
beings with our governments?

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Are they freely
coming back and forth?

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.390 align:middle line:90%
Are we still in negotiations?

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Are we still working
with programs with them?

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: I think-- I
don't know for a fact,

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:51.710 align:middle line:84%
because I was not at that
part of an access program

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.990 align:middle line:90%
to know all those questions.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:58.460 align:middle line:84%
But knowing what others have
told me and what I've seen,

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.480 align:middle line:84%
we had to have some sort of
interaction with these races

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.620 align:middle line:90%
at one time or another.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think we did have, but if
you ask me if we actually did,

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.140 align:middle line:84%
I can't say whether
we did or not.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you aware
of in your briefings--

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:84%
I was privy to
some briefings that

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.870 align:middle line:84%
stated that back in the day,
they were doing exchanges.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:26.245 align:middle line:84%
They were also exchanging
equipment, all sorts of gear.

00:14:26.245 --> 00:14:28.098 align:middle line:90%
Do you know anything about that?

00:14:28.098 --> 00:14:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: The only thing
I know about is that we

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.110 align:middle line:90%
had gifts from the races.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing I
actually read about

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.870 align:middle line:84%
was that the races
gave us gifts.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.238 align:middle line:90%
And the gifts were crafts.

00:14:45.238 --> 00:14:46.280 align:middle line:90%
They gave us some crafts.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And there's no
contract involved with that?

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.870 align:middle line:90%
They were gifts.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Yeah, as far as
I know, they were gifts.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.340 align:middle line:84%
That's the only thing I read,
that the extraterrestrial races

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.680 align:middle line:84%
had provided the United
States government with gifts.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And the United
States government,

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.050 align:middle line:84%
would they inform
the military of this

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.990 align:middle line:84%
or give it to the major
corporations that kind of run

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.100 align:middle line:90%
the planet?

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.125 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: No, the
military would keep it.

00:15:06.125 --> 00:15:07.250 align:middle line:90%
DARPA would end up with it.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.880 align:middle line:84%
It would be too
complex, underground.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And we'd be trying to
reverse engineer it.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:17.390 align:middle line:84%
In Area 51, one of the
things I need to explain

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:22.880 align:middle line:84%
is there's two separate
scientific and engineering

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.750 align:middle line:90%
sections out there.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:34.460 align:middle line:84%
One is we are creating the
new technology from US minds.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:39.260 align:middle line:84%
The other is we are reverse
engineering technology

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.980 align:middle line:84%
from the extraterrestrials,
the items they've given us.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, we not only received
crafts from them,

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.400 align:middle line:84%
we've received other
things from them--

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:55.610 align:middle line:84%
objects, energy
devices, weapon systems,

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.930 align:middle line:84%
a propulsion system
that we still

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:84%
can't understand that
they gave it to us.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.760 align:middle line:90%
And we just can't understand it.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.560 align:middle line:90%
The craft--

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: No instruction
book included.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: No instruction
book included.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.103 align:middle line:90%
Here it is, US.

00:16:10.103 --> 00:16:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to figure it out,

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.340 align:middle line:84%
because your technology's
advanced as ours,

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.510 align:middle line:90%
and we'll give it to you.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:16.885 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to figure it out

00:16:16.885 --> 00:16:20.220 align:middle line:84%
in maybe 50 years
or 1,000 years.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You don't believe we've
already figured it out today?

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've had a lot of
this stuff for a long time.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering why it's
not being released

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.968 align:middle line:84%
in a safe and effective way
to help clean up our planet.

00:16:34.968 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: I think
after years-- it's

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.510 align:middle line:84%
been 30-something years since
I left government service.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.290 align:middle line:84%
I think we've probably
progressed a lot

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.700 align:middle line:84%
to where we understand a
lot of their technology

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.940 align:middle line:84%
where we didn't
understand it years ago.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think that when we
bring out that technology

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and try to make it work or
try to reverse engineer it,

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.100 align:middle line:84%
we're ahead more now
than we were in the past.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: All right.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.290 align:middle line:84%
So are you aware of any of
these downed craft in oceans

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:06.540 align:middle line:84%
or in middle Earth
or in cave systems?

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:10.109 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: I just know one
that happened in Lake Erie.

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:12.270 align:middle line:90%
A UFO had crashed in Lake Erie.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:15.060 align:middle line:84%
It was witnessed by a
number of different people.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:22.349 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was even on the old
mystery program some years ago.

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:27.839 align:middle line:84%
And the Coast Guard went
out and spotted and located

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:28.920 align:middle line:90%
where this craft was.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.297 align:middle line:90%
It was in--

00:17:30.297 --> 00:17:31.380 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember how deep.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.980 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty deep.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:37.440 align:middle line:84%
So a Navy ship had to come up
through the St. Lawrence River

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.950 align:middle line:84%
into Lake Erie and
actually recover it.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And that craft was then
transported to Area 51.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, there wasn't
any creatures aboard.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Was it intact?

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: It was intact.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.500 align:middle line:90%
It crashed in Lake Erie.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Somehow-- and I don't know
if anybody knows this.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.265 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how the
creatures got out of it.

00:17:58.265 --> 00:18:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They
teletransported somewhere.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Maybe
they teletransported,

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:05.135 align:middle line:84%
but they believed it
was a reptilian craft.

00:18:05.135 --> 00:18:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, they do?

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: It was similar
to what the reptilians had.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things we do know is

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:16.170 align:middle line:84%
we do know-- if we get a craft
and there wasn't any ETs in it,

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.210 align:middle line:84%
we've had so many that
we could tell which

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.570 align:middle line:90%
race was flying that craft.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them send
out these empty drones

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.887 align:middle line:84%
to go check things out, and we
shoot them down or they crash

00:18:25.887 --> 00:18:26.970 align:middle line:90%
and there's nothing there.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.595 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: That could
be what happened.

00:18:28.595 --> 00:18:30.420 align:middle line:84%
That very well could
be what happened.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:84%
One particular was a craft
that was embedded into bedrock.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.840 align:middle line:84%
They figured it must have
crashed about 60 million years

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.800 align:middle line:84%
ago, because it was
in a bedrock that

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.750 align:middle line:84%
had been on Earth for years,
I mean, millions of years.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.166 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Was it fossilized?

00:18:50.166 --> 00:18:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: No, the
craft wasn't fossilized.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.900 align:middle line:84%
The craft was huge, probably
30 or 40 foot in diameter.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:01.680 align:middle line:84%
It was found up in Idaho
at an archaeological dig

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.540 align:middle line:90%
for dinosaur bones.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.620 align:middle line:90%
Discovered it.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:08.400 align:middle line:84%
They saw this big piece
of metal sticking out.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And as they started digging
more and more and more and more,

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.510 align:middle line:84%
they realized, this
is something else.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:14.820 align:middle line:90%
This is a craft.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:84%
So they immediately
notified the government.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.970 align:middle line:84%
The government came in, shut
down their archaeological site.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:26.820 align:middle line:84%
They transported the craft back
to Area 51 at the S2 complex,

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.350 align:middle line:90%
and they opened the craft.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And it took them some
time to open up the craft.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Inside the craft
were dead aliens,

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.910 align:middle line:84%
but they were some species
that they'd never seen before.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:46.310 align:middle line:84%
It was more like a tall Nordic
with an extraterrestrial head.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.000 align:middle line:90%
The head was really large.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.330 align:middle line:84%
The body of these creatures
were somewhat of a human.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.650 align:middle line:84%
They had hands and
thumbs, but the heads

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.120 align:middle line:90%
were entirely different.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.070 align:middle line:90%
They had large heads.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.950 align:middle line:84%
They had eyes that
were very complex.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that was odd
is the bodies were dead,

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:90%
but they hadn't deteriorated.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Something occurred
inside that spacecraft

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.147 align:middle line:90%
that preserved those creatures.

00:20:13.147 --> 00:20:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Like mummified
them in a way.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.313 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Mummified
them inside the--

00:20:16.313 --> 00:20:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you see
the skin texture at all?

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.440 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: I didn't see them.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.160 align:middle line:90%
I just read about them.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I mean,
in the briefing--

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yeah.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they--

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --did they mention they
were scaly skin, regular skin,

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:90%
smooth?

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They were scaly
skin, almost like fish skin

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:90%
they described it as.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:35.430 align:middle line:84%
They had almost two sets of eyes
and an eyeball in front and one

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.380 align:middle line:90%
in the back.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:84%
During the autopsy,
they figured that out.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And that was recovered,
I believe, back

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:45.780 align:middle line:90%
in the mid 80s or so.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where's that
craft located today?

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: The last time I
knew, it was still at Area 51.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.513 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you know if the
propulsion units or anything

00:20:53.513 --> 00:20:54.860 align:middle line:90%
in the craft still work?

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: I don't know.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.510 align:middle line:90%
I was never briefed on that.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if
it worked or not.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.420 align:middle line:84%
But if something is sat
around for 65 million years,

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.683 align:middle line:84%
estimating the Earth around
it was 65 million years old,

00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:08.850 align:middle line:84%
so this thing crashed and
had been covered with dirt

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.350 align:middle line:90%
over that period of time.

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:13.380 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing that something
was flying around Earth

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.670 align:middle line:90%
65 million years ago.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it possible it could
have teletransported itself

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:21.282 align:middle line:84%
into bedrock just a few
days before they found it?

00:21:21.282 --> 00:21:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: I guess
that's possible.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.540 align:middle line:90%
That's very possible.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Never thought of that.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Over the five races
we've been talking about,

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:31.680 align:middle line:84%
what's the benevolence
of each race?

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And are they wanting
something from us?

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.280 align:middle line:90%
Or are they just here to help?

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: I think each
race is here for themselves.

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:84%
They have something
to gain, whether it

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:47.280 align:middle line:84%
be in manipulating our DNA,
cloning humans, gathering

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.100 align:middle line:84%
fertile eggs from
females or semen

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:55.020 align:middle line:84%
from males, experimenting
with our animals,

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.050 align:middle line:90%
with different toxins and stuff.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.660 align:middle line:90%
But they're here for themselves.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.790 align:middle line:84%
There's something
on Earth for them,

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.170 align:middle line:90%
and they wouldn't be here.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And I think
every one of them

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.600 align:middle line:84%
has something in the
game for themselves.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.650 align:middle line:84%
The only one that's probably
benevolent that I'm not sure

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:15.840 align:middle line:84%
would fit that category
would be the Ebens.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.130 align:middle line:84%
But then you look at what
they said about abducting--

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:21.000 align:middle line:90%
they don't abduct.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:84%
They ask our people
to voluntarily submit

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:27.340 align:middle line:90%
to examination.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So you figure out that
they're in this for something.

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:35.813 align:middle line:84%
Every one of those five alien
races are in for themselves.

00:22:35.813 --> 00:22:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you
aware of anything

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:41.895 align:middle line:84%
that we want from them,
such as technology?

00:22:41.895 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Just technology.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.320 align:middle line:90%
I think that's the big plan.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And probably information
about the universe.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:52.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even just
before I got out,

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.490 align:middle line:84%
NASA became involved
in the program.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:58.680 align:middle line:84%
They got some people
briefed into the program.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.110 align:middle line:90%
And they came to a meeting.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And NASA wanted to know
specific in regarding

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:09.330 align:middle line:84%
to Amber Sun what these
extraterrestrials are

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:10.620 align:middle line:90%
saying about the universe.

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:11.940 align:middle line:90%
What's out there?

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.890 align:middle line:90%
How are they traveling?

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:16.560 align:middle line:84%
How can they get from
one planet to another?

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Is it just their technology?

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Their propulsion system is
more advanced than ours?

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.170 align:middle line:90%
What are they finding?

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Are the quasars the same
in this part of the--

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.450 align:middle line:84%
these type of questions
are being asked.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:28.830 align:middle line:90%
And that was in 1988.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure those same questions
are being asked today.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: With the five ET types
that we've been talking about,

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:37.657 align:middle line:84%
did we learn anything about
the physics of our universe?

00:23:37.657 --> 00:23:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, if
you believe Serpo,

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.140 align:middle line:84%
and you believe what the crew
members that came back told us

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.060 align:middle line:90%
about Serpo--

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.940 align:middle line:84%
the crew members, the team
that went up there to Serpo,

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.450 align:middle line:84%
found out that the
physics on that planet

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:53.700 align:middle line:84%
is not the same as
physics on Earth.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:57.300 align:middle line:84%
There's so many things
that are different.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Just Kepler's theory, they
mentioned is not accurate.

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:05.032 align:middle line:84%
You can't use Kepler's
theory of the gravity,

00:24:05.032 --> 00:24:06.240 align:middle line:90%
because gravity's different--

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Different.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: --in Serpo.

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:10.860 align:middle line:90%
So that's not the same.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.860 align:middle line:90%
So you can't use the same.

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.840 align:middle line:84%
So there are some things that
we learned from the Ebens

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.620 align:middle line:84%
about the physics
different in the universe.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure we probably
gained information

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.580 align:middle line:84%
from the other races
that we had in captivity,

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.570 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't have privy to that.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:31.185 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So in the 1980s,
Director Williams Casey

00:24:31.185 --> 00:24:35.760 align:middle line:84%
of the CIA did brief
President Reagan on something.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.160 align:middle line:90%
Could you talk about that?

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: He briefed Reagan
on the exchange program.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.480 align:middle line:84%
He briefed Reagan
on the types of ETs

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.090 align:middle line:84%
that the United
States knew about.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And he briefed Reagan on
the technologies that we got

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:55.543 align:middle line:84%
and we were trying to
reverse from the ETs.

00:24:55.543 --> 00:24:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were there
any additional races

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:00.000 align:middle line:84%
mentioned in those
briefings that you were not

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.080 align:middle line:90%
familiar with?

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: There probably were.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.750 align:middle line:84%
There probably were
other races that they

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.190 align:middle line:90%
might have known about.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:11.160 align:middle line:84%
But maybe over
the years, there's

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.520 align:middle line:84%
been more that has visited
that we know about.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to deny that
I might not know about them.

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.720 align:middle line:84%
But I have friends still within
the intelligence community.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And what they're-- one,
my very, very best friend,

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.790 align:middle line:84%
who I just spoke to two days
ago before I came on your show,

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:33.390 align:middle line:84%
he told me when I was talking
about the same subject--

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:37.380 align:middle line:84%
and I asked him point blank, how
many alien races have visited

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:38.760 align:middle line:90%
Earth that we know about?

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.200 align:middle line:90%
He said five.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.820 align:middle line:90%
I said just five?

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Because I've read on the
internet and I've read in books

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.820 align:middle line:84%
there are 50 or 60
different races.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:84%
He said we, the United
States government,

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.880 align:middle line:84%
knows of these five
races, only five.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Now maybe the
Russians know more.

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Maybe the Chinese know more.

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:02.885 align:middle line:84%
But we, the United States,
only know of these five races.

00:26:02.885 --> 00:26:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So he's still
doing active investigations?

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: He's doing
active investigations.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Unfortunately,
because I'm out,

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.460 align:middle line:84%
he doesn't tell me about
his investigations.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.005 align:middle line:84%
Although he hints
to some things.

00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So tell us
about the confusion

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and misinformation out there
online with all these races.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well,
people's perception--

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.560 align:middle line:84%
every person has a different
perception of something.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:32.800 align:middle line:84%
An abductee will get abducted
by an alien race, some alien,

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and their explanation of what
they were abducted by is going

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.050 align:middle line:84%
to be different than
somebody else's.

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So a UFO investigator,
a field investigator,

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:47.590 align:middle line:84%
a non-military investigator,
non-intelligence investigator

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.690 align:middle line:84%
would take their
description and try

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:53.050 align:middle line:84%
to categorize that
description with some kind

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:54.610 align:middle line:90%
of an alien race.

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And there are some-- and
there was one particular one

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:59.440 align:middle line:84%
at a UFO convention some
years ago, a writer.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.850 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember his name.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.370 align:middle line:84%
But he told us that--
he said this to us.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:05.020 align:middle line:90%
He said, you know what?

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.700 align:middle line:90%
I believe what you're saying.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.760 align:middle line:84%
The Trantaloids can
be to one person

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:16.360 align:middle line:84%
15 different things
than the other person.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.450 align:middle line:84%
To you, if you're
abducted by a Trantaloid,

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:21.040 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at
a praying mantis.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.280 align:middle line:84%
To me, I might not know
what a praying mantis was.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Never seen one, so I'm going to
interpret it as something else.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's, I think, one of
the reasons why there's so

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:35.260 align:middle line:84%
many different categories
of ETs that are abducting

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.090 align:middle line:90%
or that are visiting Earth.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: By being
exposed to these five

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:41.350 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
types, has it affected

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:42.960 align:middle line:90%
you and your life in any way?

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well,
the only thing that

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.280 align:middle line:84%
affects me is what the Ebens
said about visiting Earth

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.410 align:middle line:90%
2,000 years ago.

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:52.330 align:middle line:90%
I was raised a Catholic.

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:56.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I spent a year in a
monastery before I got out.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:03.102 align:middle line:84%
But it kind of makes me
think about our religion.

00:28:03.102 --> 00:28:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And not just Catholic
religion, but other religions--

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, sure.

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: --because
most believe in God.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Christians believe in God
and believe in Jesus Christ.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.600 align:middle line:90%
And I still think about that.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.770 align:middle line:84%
That still affects me, but
none of the other ones do.

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:20.460 align:middle line:84%
None of the other races
that I think about.

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Although I certainly
wouldn't want to be abducted.

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what the
category ET chooses in a person

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:31.420 align:middle line:84%
to be abducted, but I certainly
wouldn't want to be abducted.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.430 align:middle line:84%
But I have a lot of
sympathy for people

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.250 align:middle line:90%
who are legitimately abducted.

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why do you feel
it's so important to share

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.120 align:middle line:90%
this information now?

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: It's about
time it got out.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.428 align:middle line:84%
For years, I had
a security oath.

00:28:44.428 --> 00:28:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I signed a security oath--
and I have a copy of it that

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.880 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you--

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.210 align:middle line:84%
that says that I can't
talk about it for 25 years.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.210 align:middle line:90%
That was in 1988.

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:54.730 align:middle line:84%
25 years expired
a long time ago,

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:58.360 align:middle line:84%
and that's when I decided
the public needs to know.

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Now they don't need
to know everything.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:04.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of things that
I agree should be classified.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.995 align:middle line:84%
And I abide by that
classification.

00:29:05.995 --> 00:29:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: But there's a lot
of things that we need to know,

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:12.040 align:middle line:84%
that people are being
abducted out there.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.840 align:middle line:90%
And there's thousands at the--

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:18.970 align:middle line:84%
in 1988, we knew of thousands of
people who were being abducted.

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:23.890 align:middle line:84%
It's unfair for them to not know
why or who are abducting them

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:26.483 align:middle line:84%
and what our government is
doing to try to prevent that.

00:29:26.483 --> 00:29:28.400 align:middle line:84%
What are you going to
do when you're abducted?

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.370 align:middle line:84%
You're going to call
the FBI and tell the FBI

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.200 align:middle line:90%
that I was abducted by aliens?

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.450 align:middle line:84%
You know what the
FBI is going to do?

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:36.850 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
think you're not--

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:39.880 align:middle line:84%
and they're not going to
pay any attention to you.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.120 align:middle line:84%
If you call the government,
now, what would happen

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:49.150 align:middle line:84%
is most likely if that FBI agent
has a certain level of security

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.420 align:middle line:84%
clearance, he's going
to turn around and call

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.130 align:middle line:84%
OSI on the phone and
tell OSI, you know,

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.020 align:middle line:84%
I got a person that's
claimed to be abducted

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.502 align:middle line:90%
at such a such address.

00:29:57.502 --> 00:29:58.960 align:middle line:84%
You might want to
pay them a visit.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.910 align:middle line:84%
The FBI is not going
to investigate it.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there a
1-800 number for the OSI

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:05.190 align:middle line:90%
for these types of events?

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: For federal
agencies there are, yeah.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And then an OSI agent
or a US intelligence officer

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.010 align:middle line:90%
will go and visit that person.

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll vet
them to determine--

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Are they
telling the truth?

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Are they on something?

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:20.703 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Are you on something?

00:30:20.703 --> 00:30:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Are you-- yeah.

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you feel that
disclosure is on the horizon?

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what does
that mean for humanity?

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: I think
disclosure is.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I think the Tic-Tac
incident was the beginning.

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.230 align:middle line:84%
I think that Harry
Reid's statement

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:39.730 align:middle line:84%
about what he did when he
was a Senate majority leader

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and minority leader and
what he was trying to do,

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.630 align:middle line:84%
the amount of money that's
pushed into investigating

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:50.960 align:middle line:84%
of these area phenomenon,
I think that's part of it.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.500 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is
the government's

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:57.050 align:middle line:84%
not telling the truth
about a lot of this,

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:01.450 align:middle line:84%
because we've been
investigating UFOs since 1947--

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:05.710 align:middle line:84%
projects Grudge, project
Sign, Project Blue Book.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And in 1969, when
the Air Force said,

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.830 align:middle line:84%
based on a condemn
report, we're not

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:14.110 align:middle line:84%
going to investigate
them anymore

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and asked another government
agency to take over.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.540 align:middle line:84%
DIA, which was fairly a new
agency, because they came in--

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:21.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: --existence in 1961--

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:26.740 align:middle line:84%
DIA stepped up, raised their
hand, and said, we'll do it.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.490 align:middle line:90%
We want to have a mission.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.880 align:middle line:84%
So the Air Force turned
everything over to DIA.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.330 align:middle line:84%
But the Air Force continued
to investigate it.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:37.840 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force would say in
a classified document to us,

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.170 align:middle line:84%
you investigate
incidents that happened

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:45.670 align:middle line:84%
on military installations,
involving military aircrafts,

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:48.070 align:middle line:84%
near military
installations, involving

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:50.890 align:middle line:84%
the threat to a
military installation,

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.710 align:middle line:84%
or off-base involving
military personnel.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Those are the five
categories that we

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:57.400 align:middle line:90%
were supposed to investigate.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:02.740 align:middle line:84%
But do you know how broadly
that can be determined?

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.800 align:middle line:84%
If you were in the Air Force
and your sister was abducted

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and you have a high level
security clearance, guess what?

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.792 align:middle line:84%
We're going to investigate
that, because who

00:32:10.792 --> 00:32:13.000 align:middle line:84%
says your sister's not going
to back come back to you

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and ask you for information
surreptitiously?

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe these agents,
maybe these people

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:23.180 align:middle line:84%
that are abducting
these innocent people

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.850 align:middle line:84%
are actually Russian
agents or Chinese agents--

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: --or East German
back then, or whatever.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.740 align:middle line:90%
So we had to investigate it.

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.230 align:middle line:84%
We would be negligent
in our duties

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:37.680 align:middle line:90%
if we didn't investigate.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Rick.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.340 align:middle line:90%
That was fantastic.

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.240 align:middle line:90%
What a wealth of information.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being on the show.

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:44.782 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: You're very welcome.

00:32:44.782 --> 00:32:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:48.950 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:52.300 align:middle line:10%
