>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.327 align:middle line:10%
we are joined by Victoria
Whitney, a Doctor of Science

00:00:24.327 --> 00:00:25.910 align:middle line:10%
and a retired member
of the Department

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.870 align:middle line:10%
of Defense, United States Navy.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.750 align:middle line:10%
She has worked as an
environmental engineer

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.273 align:middle line:10%
and scientist in special
programs and projects.

00:00:32.273 --> 00:00:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Today, we will be
discussing her conversations

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:90%
with the Pleiadians.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.163 align:middle line:90%
Victoria, welcome.

00:00:37.163 --> 00:00:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VICTORIA WHITNEY:
Thanks, Emery.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.630 align:middle line:90%
It's nice to be here.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.463 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So tell us
about your conversations

00:00:41.463 --> 00:00:42.493 align:middle line:90%
with the Pleiadians.

00:00:42.493 --> 00:00:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well,
as you recall, we

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.110 align:middle line:84%
talked about them
coming as a conclave.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we had many, many
conversations over three years

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.020 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.580 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that
we wanted to do

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.710 align:middle line:84%
was learn as much
about them as they

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:90%
were trying to learn about us.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I went into
it with a thought of,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.900 align:middle line:90%
how are they like us?

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And how are they
different from us?

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.349 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of
different things that occurred.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:84%
But I thought today, we
would talk about some

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:84%
of the more interesting
ones about the city

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.160 align:middle line:90%
that they grew up in.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:90%
So talking with the Pleiadians.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.570 align:middle line:84%
They have many
different lineages.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:90%
They have many different cities.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Some of their cities
are just like ours.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
talk about Miranu,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:84%
which is the city that
Zendor and Ilyalia came from.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's about the
size of Seattle.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.550 align:middle line:90%
So lots of residents live there.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.330 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's close to 726,000.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.633 align:middle line:84%
It's a different type of city
than what we would be used to.

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, when we're
talking about cities,

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.020 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about the planets
and that constellation.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah, so we all
talk about the Seven Sisters.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.080 align:middle line:84%
But they have way more
planets than that.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Most of it has been colonized
in some way or another.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.490 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of
outer planets where

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.330 align:middle line:84%
they say they're not
really inhabitable,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:90%
but they do have stations there.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And those stations are
scientific stations.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure exactly
whether they're monitoring

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.810 align:middle line:90%
for something specific.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.932 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really
go into great detail.

00:02:10.932 --> 00:02:12.390 align:middle line:84%
They're one of the
few systems that

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.200 align:middle line:84%
have so many artificial
planets there, because they

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.210 align:middle line:90%
do a lot of biosphere.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.260 align:middle line:84%
They have what they call
commercialized sectors,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:84%
just like Andromedans do, where
they have these giant space

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.580 align:middle line:90%
stations.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.330 align:middle line:84%
So one of the fascinating
things they talked about

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.630 align:middle line:84%
was how most of their cities
are called regenerative cities.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
is because they're

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.010 align:middle line:84%
based on artificial
intelligence,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.220 align:middle line:84%
the city can constantly
renew itself.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was a
really fascinating concept,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.298 align:middle line:84%
because we certainly don't
have a city that can do that.

00:02:48.298 --> 00:02:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is that something
that we can look forward to?

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: I hope so.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.800 align:middle line:84%
I would love to see
something like that.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.710 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
they constantly say

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.290 align:middle line:84%
is how clean their cities
are and how healthy

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.093 align:middle line:90%
their cities are.

00:03:00.093 --> 00:03:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: In what ways?

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.552 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: And so
I looked at health,

00:03:02.552 --> 00:03:07.130 align:middle line:84%
and I said, healthy as in,
is that a social environment?

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well, yes,
socially, they're very healthy.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's also what it does
for their actual system itself

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:90%
is that it's very healthy.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of energy
that they encompass

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.340 align:middle line:84%
into their cities
that are supposed

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:84%
to be of benefit
to the inhabitants

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.570 align:middle line:84%
there, which I found
that interesting--

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where does
that energy come from?

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, from
different sources.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.990 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of it is they
talk about the waters

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.810 align:middle line:84%
that are on their
planets and how--

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.320 align:middle line:84%
for instance, with
the Pleiadians,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.950 align:middle line:84%
they talk about the
luminescent waters.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's not unusual.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Arcturians have the
same thing, but they

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.612 align:middle line:84%
call theirs effervescent
as opposed to luminous.

00:03:45.612 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:84%
So of course, my questions would
be, well, what's the difference?

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And for the Pleiadians, this
luminescent waters, so they

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:90%
make artificial walls out of it.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And these artificial
walls are meant

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.230 align:middle line:84%
to radiate specific energies
throughout the city.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And then as you come in
contact with those energies,

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.270 align:middle line:84%
you're getting some type
of health benefit from it.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.093 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, it's
light, isn't it?

00:04:07.093 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:90%
It's photons.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: It is
light very much.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And so you're getting a
transfer of those energies

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.890 align:middle line:90%
through your system.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So we talk a lot about
it in classes, photon

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.399 align:middle line:84%
and phonon exchange through
transfer or conversion, right?

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:22.800 align:middle line:84%
But this is actually seeing
that happen in their cities.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought that
was really great to think

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.570 align:middle line:84%
that they would go that
far to say, wait a minute.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Our environment should be
supporting the inhabitants

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.350 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And they have a lot
of green spaces there.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact that some cities
try to put in parks and trees.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.360 align:middle line:84%
But this is actually part
of their living environment.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.160 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.577 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what
other beings are

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.010 align:middle line:90%
included in this environment?

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.843 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, for
most of the Pleiadians,

00:04:48.843 --> 00:04:52.340 align:middle line:84%
they say most of their lineage
is a Pleiadian-type lineage.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.970 align:middle line:84%
They don't get a lot of outside
people in there, so to speak.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Unlike when we talk about the
Orions, which is a trade center,

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:84%
so they're going to get a lot
more different species in there.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.530 align:middle line:84%
But for the Pleiadians,
they say most of them

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.010 align:middle line:90%
are their actual lineages.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So they have lineages
through Melchizedeks, Lyrans,

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:84%
lots of different lineages
because of the wars

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.500 align:middle line:90%
that they had.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.870 align:middle line:84%
So most of these, when you
get in there, they'll say,

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.410 align:middle line:84%
I believe they said they had
close to 11,000 different

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:84%
species, but they're
all Pleiadian species.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So when we go talk about
some of the other ones,

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.120 align:middle line:84%
they won't be saying the
same thing because they've

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.720 align:middle line:90%
had different influences.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.320 align:middle line:84%
But for this city,
most of them are

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.020 align:middle line:90%
what they consider Pleiadians.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I think
that's a good point

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.710 align:middle line:84%
to bring up because when
we're at these conferences

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and answering questions to
the public, a lot of people

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.760 align:middle line:84%
have this affinity
of being Pleiadian.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And it's so vast
and so much with the DNA

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.900 align:middle line:84%
that I have seen that it's
an unlimited amount almost.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's just like here.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.810 align:middle line:90%
We're all human.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.600 align:middle line:84%
But we're different species
of human, different cultural

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.130 align:middle line:84%
backgrounds and some
differences in our DNA.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's very much
like them as well.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So why
are they here now?

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Why are we working together?

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, they've
always been here.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.470 align:middle line:84%
This has been their
laboratory, so to speak.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And they look at the way in
which our cities are growing.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.290 align:middle line:84%
How do we make the decisions to
colonize in certain places, how

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle line:90%
we tend to base our structures?

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.680 align:middle line:84%
How much health do we
put into our cities?

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And so then in comparison,
here's a culture

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.390 align:middle line:84%
that that comes
first, that they make

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.360 align:middle line:84%
sure that the environment for
their inhabitants is so healthy,

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:84%
and that it speaks to
their consciousness

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.900 align:middle line:90%
and speaks to their frequency.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:90%
We don't do those things.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Most people are just now going,
oh, there's a higher frequency.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.190 align:middle line:84%
So they have full
meditation centers

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.600 align:middle line:90%
that are throughout their city.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And they have these
luminous waters

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.230 align:middle line:84%
that make these walls
that are supposed

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.670 align:middle line:84%
to be creating these frequencies
throughout the city that

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.570 align:middle line:84%
are giving them harmony
in their attitudes

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and their well-being and
different things like that.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.110 align:middle line:84%
We just don't do
things like that.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard for us to imagine
a city that's like this.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.000 align:middle line:90%
I would love to see this city.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.800 align:middle line:90%
I--

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.217 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's like
a reciprocating

00:07:19.217 --> 00:07:20.510 align:middle line:90%
energy that keeps coming back.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Indeed.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And it helps everyone.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't have
anything like crime.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's not to say there's
not crime out in the cosmos.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.230 align:middle line:90%
That's not a true statement.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.560 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have crime
within their cities.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Their inhabitants-- one
of the questions I said

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.480 align:middle line:90%
is, do you ever disagree?

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Because we have
disagreements here.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Of course.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: And
they said, no, it's

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.780 align:middle line:90%
everybody voicing their opinion.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.830 align:middle line:84%
But because of the
energies, it keeps them

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.700 align:middle line:90%
in a very balanced state.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's maybe
the key to this city

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.050 align:middle line:84%
is that it is creating
this balanced state.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.400 align:middle line:90%
There's no tension.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And we can't say that
here because cities

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:03.470 align:middle line:90%
do create tension.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Overpopulation-- this is a
city the size of Seattle.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.620 align:middle line:84%
There would be overpopulation
to some extent.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you wouldn't say
this is some sort of control

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.767 align:middle line:84%
or anything of this
energy for people--

00:08:14.767 --> 00:08:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: I don't believe it is

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --because their
emotions are still,

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:18.930 align:middle line:90%
I guess, free will?

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:19.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.442 align:middle line:84%
They still honor
the universal law,

00:08:21.442 --> 00:08:22.650 align:middle line:90%
so they still have free will.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:84%
But I think what they do is
they see the benefit in it.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.260 align:middle line:84%
I love when we see the morning
trash truck go out and try

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.590 align:middle line:90%
to pick up all the trash.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.320 align:middle line:84%
They would never have
anything like that

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.809 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
zero waste city.

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, how do you
get to be a zero waste city?

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, we package
everything that we have.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.680 align:middle line:84%
They don't do the
same thing, like food.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.410 align:middle line:90%
They have food synthesizers.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.320 align:middle line:84%
They have big stations
where people can

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.200 align:middle line:90%
come in and commune together.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.820 align:middle line:90%
They use a gel-type food source.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:08:59.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm not--

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And a
lot of that, too--

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.550 align:middle line:90%
correct me if I'm wrong--

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.510 align:middle line:84%
that that food or that
energy is actually put

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:90%
in the body in a different way.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yes.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.110 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So when we're
looking at this, it

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.900 align:middle line:84%
is meant to be every
nutrient that the body needs.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I laughed because we saw
some of that with the ship

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:90%
when they were here.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
Ilyalia stuck her finger

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.760 align:middle line:84%
in this little cup that
had this gel in it.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.915 align:middle line:90%
And then the gel was--

00:09:31.915 --> 00:09:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That was it.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.915 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: And that was it.

00:09:33.915 --> 00:09:35.320 align:middle line:90%
She did by osmosis.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.600 align:middle line:90%
Her body just took it in.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's very efficient.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, they
don't need a kitchen

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:90%
because they don't prep foods.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There's
no waste of energy.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Exactly.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's available
whenever they need it.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.440 align:middle line:84%
They don't need to package
anything whatsoever.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And then we look at
those things about--

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.940 align:middle line:90%
yes, they wear clothing.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.400 align:middle line:84%
They have furniture,
different things like that.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.280 align:middle line:84%
We, in the same process,
have those things.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:11.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's the way-- we do a
lot of plastic packaging.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And companies are always
looking for new ways to do that.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.190 align:middle line:90%
They don't do any of that.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:16.960 align:middle line:90%
It's nanotechnology.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's just immediately
there for the using.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.220 align:middle line:84%
So they don't need
to have waste.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And I would love for us
to be able to get there

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.540 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But that's a huge technology
that we need to overcome.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about
their actual bodies?

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.720 align:middle line:90%
Does it produce waste?

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Their bodies
do produce some waste.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.680 align:middle line:84%
But their system of eliminating
that waste is different.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And there, again, just
from seeing on board ship.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.920 align:middle line:90%
So we worry about urine, right?

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.250 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a
urine that they're

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.290 align:middle line:90%
getting rid of like that.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And so they do have, though,
a way in which their body--

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.420 align:middle line:84%
we would look at it
like sweating sort of.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, it's like
on a very smaller level.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Like a
cellular level, where--

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And because they're not
taking in solid foods,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.780 align:middle line:84%
that they don't have
to worry about going

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.660 align:middle line:84%
through their intestines
and then trying to get rid

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.080 align:middle line:90%
of all of that waste.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.548 align:middle line:90%
So it's very different from us.

00:11:20.548 --> 00:11:21.590 align:middle line:90%
It's much more efficient.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.610 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I found
fascinating was showering.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.300 align:middle line:90%
We take a water shower, right?

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.430 align:middle line:84%
They don't use
water in that way.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:35.740 align:middle line:84%
It's an energetic exchange
between their body.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.680 align:middle line:84%
So they have these stalls
that they get into,

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and this energy circulates
in this stall and exchanges

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:90%
with their body.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:90%
And then they come out.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's no dead skin
cells or any of that.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.250 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to go through
a drying time or anything.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:57.570 align:middle line:90%
I just found that fascinating.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:58.903 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh, I could do that.

00:11:58.903 --> 00:12:01.740 align:middle line:84%
That would save me
several minutes every day.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that was
fascinating to see

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:07.700 align:middle line:84%
that they don't have running
tap water in their-- they

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.120 align:middle line:90%
call them units.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.210 align:middle line:90%
They don't call them houses.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well,
how big is a unit.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:13.897 align:middle line:90%
Can you describe that?

00:12:13.897 --> 00:12:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So they use what they
call a layering method.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.287 align:middle line:90%
So everything goes up--

00:12:19.287 --> 00:12:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A layering.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Takes up less space for them.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And everything is set
up so that they're

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:30.500 align:middle line:84%
taking the solar
energy out of the air.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's that
autonomous system

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.440 align:middle line:90%
of their AI that is doing this.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And so for instance, they have a
lot of interactive glass walls.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.020 align:middle line:90%
I thought my TV screen was big.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:45.500 align:middle line:84%
They sit there, and they talk
about these all-encompassing

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:84%
walls that they
can bring in data,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.030 align:middle line:90%
something we would call news.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So these walls that
are light, they're actually

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.545 align:middle line:90%
multi-purpose, obviously.

00:12:56.545 --> 00:12:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Yes,
yes, very much so.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So if they need to broadcast
news to their citizens,

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.460 align:middle line:90%
it comes across this wall.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.840 align:middle line:84%
They have morning mantras
that come across these walls

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.630 align:middle line:84%
to ensure that the citizens are
always getting a healthy dose--

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Even
palpate these walls?

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yes.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:14.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.465 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: These light walls?

00:13:15.465 --> 00:13:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah, yeah, it's
very interesting stuff.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.560 align:middle line:84%
I would love for
us to get there.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm just envisioning everything
that we could do with them.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:28.860 align:middle line:84%
But like I say, the entire
city is meant to maintain them.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things
that's interesting

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.910 align:middle line:90%
is the city has sensors.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's say we
stepped outside today.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
cooler outside, right?

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:41.930 align:middle line:84%
But it would pick up on that
and adjust the temperature

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.878 align:middle line:84%
for that specific being,
which I found interesting,

00:13:45.878 --> 00:13:46.920 align:middle line:90%
because we can't do that.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.128 align:middle line:84%
We have to adjust the
temperature for the whole room,

00:13:49.128 --> 00:13:50.110 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So these sensors are
looking for those things.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of the questions
we asked them was,

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.660 align:middle line:84%
so let's say that
you're not feeling 100%.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.470 align:middle line:90%
Does it pick up?

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And they said yes,
and it immediately

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.330 align:middle line:84%
starts making
adjustments for that.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.850 align:middle line:84%
So they don't really
have something

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:11.110 align:middle line:84%
like an illness or sick cycle
that they have to go through.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.630 align:middle line:84%
So the city is very
healthy for that.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.220 align:middle line:84%
But they do have these
meditative centers throughout.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.190 align:middle line:84%
They're meant to
take people in there

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:22.810 align:middle line:84%
and allow them that time
to commune with nature.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.090 align:middle line:90%
That's very important to them.

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:29.890 align:middle line:84%
So that led us to the
question, do you have pets?

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we have many,
many different species,

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.330 align:middle line:84%
but we do not dominate
them, meaning that they

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.520 align:middle line:90%
don't keep them as pets.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:84%
But they also have
artificial intelligence

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.910 align:middle line:90%
that they consider pets.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:46.040 align:middle line:90%
And I thought that was--

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.180 align:middle line:90%
we see more of that now.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Kids are getting toys
that look like dogs.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:49.805 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, yeah.

00:14:49.805 --> 00:14:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Robots.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Exactly.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:53.290 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:55.758 align:middle line:84%
So you can envision
that that's probably--

00:14:55.758 --> 00:14:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are some of their
core beliefs in their society

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.100 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah, so they have
really five core beliefs.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, they start off, and
they say everything is energy.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you understand
everything as energy,

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:12.310 align:middle line:84%
then it's just a matter of how
you want to use that energy.

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:13.700 align:middle line:90%
We, too, are energy.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.160 align:middle line:84%
So when we start looking at
it, a lot of what I teach

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.760 align:middle line:90%
is, what is energy?

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.650 align:middle line:84%
What are the
processes for energy?

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.870 align:middle line:90%
What's the language of energy?

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.280 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of
what they do too.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.430 align:middle line:90%
They're miles ahead of us on it.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.830 align:middle line:84%
But we're beginning
to understand

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:30.890 align:middle line:90%
more and more of that.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very
huge core belief

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.940 align:middle line:84%
for them is that
everything is energy.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And the next one is that we've
talked about this before, the 42

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.680 align:middle line:90%
universal laws.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:90%
So that's what they live by.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.120 align:middle line:84%
They don't have extraneous
laws like we do.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.495 align:middle line:84%
Thou shalt not
kill your neighbor.

00:15:46.495 --> 00:15:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, that
wouldn't be normal.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.110 align:middle line:84%
That wouldn't be
in their paradigm

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.990 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever, because they
live by these other laws that

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.100 align:middle line:90%
are given by the universe.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And so that becomes
very important to them.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.280 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking free will, the
law of abundance, manifestation,

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.470 align:middle line:90%
so on and so forth.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.460 align:middle line:90%
There is a law of catastrophe.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.850 align:middle line:84%
So your catastrophe
and my catastrophe

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:09.140 align:middle line:90%
are two different things.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So that comes down to what we
believe catastrophe really is.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.770 align:middle line:90%
It could be an emotional thing.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.090 align:middle line:90%
It could be a natural disaster.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:20.280 align:middle line:84%
There's no telling
what it would be.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:84%
We did ask them if they have
earthquakes and things like that

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.250 align:middle line:84%
because we experienced
that frequently around--

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And that's
part of the growth--

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: It's part of growth.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: --of your energy.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.020 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.200 align:middle line:84%
They need to have
those occurrences

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.410 align:middle line:84%
to remember that
they're supposed

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.778 align:middle line:90%
to be continuing to grow.

00:16:37.778 --> 00:16:38.820 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, what do we do?

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:90%
We get static in our belief.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And so that's very
much a core part

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.850 align:middle line:90%
of that is the renewal process.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And it usually takes
some catastrophe

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.550 align:middle line:84%
to remind us that that's what
we're supposed to be doing.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.160 align:middle line:84%
But like I say, we asked
them, do you have earthquakes?

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no, we
don't experience those.

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Some of the outer
planets, especially

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.200 align:middle line:84%
the ones that they have
these science setups on,

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.830 align:middle line:84%
may experience some of
that because they're not

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:90%
fully developed planets.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.888 align:middle line:84%
They might be an asteroid
or something like that.

00:17:08.888 --> 00:17:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, how do
they look on us then?

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, yeah,
how do they look at us?

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We're pretty
archaic, I would think.

00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:15.780 align:middle line:90%
Well, we're children.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.290 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be many
instances where they refer

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:22.619 align:middle line:84%
to us as still being childish
in our actions and our attitudes

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:23.609 align:middle line:90%
and very much so.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:28.069 align:middle line:84%
If we look at them,
they're highly intelligent.

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:29.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they don't--

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But they were kind
of like us in the beginning.

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Oh, definitely.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So--

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: If we go back
22 million years ago,

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.280 align:middle line:84%
when they're talking
about, you know--

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: 22 million years ago.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yes.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about
the wars and how

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.190 align:middle line:84%
they had to migrate
to other planets,

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and that they left
their homes for a while.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And earth became a way station
for them to pass through here.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
then they began to war

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.340 align:middle line:90%
over that end of it.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.080 align:middle line:90%
And so they were asked to leave.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And so we can understand
that that's a natural course

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.860 align:middle line:90%
of action with attitudes.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Everybody, even us here, we
have ownership over something.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.790 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to turn it
over to somebody else.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And that became very much
what was happening here.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, they were
asked to vacate the premises.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure who asked
them to vacate the premises.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.880 align:middle line:84%
But clearly, it was
somebody high enough up

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.200 align:middle line:90%
that they would honor that.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.820 align:middle line:84%
But they talk about then having
to go and colonize other places.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about how
tough that was to colonize,

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.910 align:middle line:84%
because some of the
planets they went to,

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:39.480 align:middle line:84%
they were so unfamiliar
with-- and some of the plants

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.730 align:middle line:84%
they went to, they said there
were other species there

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.060 align:middle line:90%
that they knew nothing about.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:43.470 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.387 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Which brings
me to the next question.

00:18:45.387 --> 00:18:49.220 align:middle line:84%
What about these interplanetary
species with Pleiadians?

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And do they have relationships
and partnerships and marriages?

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.490 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
marriage for a minute.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.777 align:middle line:84%
So when they were
here, Ilyalia had come.

00:19:00.777 --> 00:19:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they were
living in a homeless camp

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.390 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And they met a couple
in there that had,

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.840 align:middle line:84%
over the course of 14 months,
developed a relationship

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.500 align:middle line:90%
and decided to get married.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And she was fascinated
because she's got telepathy.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So she's seeing
exactly how they feel.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I
don't understand why

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.900 align:middle line:84%
they would want to join together
because of the way they--

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.220 align:middle line:84%
while they don't
express it verbally,

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:84%
internally, they
were expressing it,

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and it was conflicting
information.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I'm not sure
what their purpose is.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And so we talked a lot about,
well, what are they saying?

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, he felt he
was more superior than she was.

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.860 align:middle line:90%
She thought she was an equal.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.180 align:middle line:84%
But they never expressed
that between the two of them.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And then she said then he
always wanted to be catered to,

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.960 align:middle line:84%
and she was the one that was
supposed to be the caterer.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, well,
this is interesting.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.360 align:middle line:84%
So I took her to
a friend of mine

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.220 align:middle line:84%
who was getting married,
big wedding in Seattle,

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:09.640 align:middle line:84%
big cathedral, Catholic church,
all the trimmings, everything

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.970 align:middle line:90%
very fancy.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And there, again, she was
fascinated because she said,

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand why the
bride has a smile on her face.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And yet the entire
time she's walking down

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.350 align:middle line:84%
the aisle, she's thinking, what
do I look like to other people?

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Do they think I spent
enough on this wedding?

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:25.720 align:middle line:90%
And she--

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That must be
an energy overload--

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: It was.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --for her
to experience that.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And then the groom was thinking
about his stocks the whole time.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't
understand why they would

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:40.330 align:middle line:90%
do this and join together.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So then that led to the
question, well, do you marry?

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, we're
bred for each other.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.680 align:middle line:90%
We are similar energies.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.960 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
can align that way.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And so she said, what
happens is they have

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.450 align:middle line:90%
this thing called the tripantu.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Tripantu.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Tripantu.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What is that?

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.857 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: And
that's the joining.

00:20:59.857 --> 00:21:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And it happens only during
a 12-day period each year.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's when the--

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.210 align:middle line:84%
from where the sun sets
across the Seven Sisters,

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:13.740 align:middle line:84%
it creates this helical
cycle around the planets.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they say,
at that time, they

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.750 align:middle line:90%
can see themselves in the stars.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is the time in which
they do this weaving of life.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.870 align:middle line:84%
So there's these
threads that they

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:27.107 align:middle line:84%
say that they weave through
life, that weaves them together.

00:21:27.107 --> 00:21:28.190 align:middle line:90%
And this is their joining.

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Like a
helix, you're saying?

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yes.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Like--

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yes.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a
fascinating thing.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.060 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a very big ceremony.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
times, they've never

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.760 align:middle line:84%
met the person that they're
going to be joining with.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was interesting
because I thought, wow,

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.970 align:middle line:84%
if we did that here, oh
my gosh, World War III

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.540 align:middle line:90%
would occur with some people.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.670 align:middle line:84%
But for this, they've
never met him.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:52.750 align:middle line:84%
But they show up to this
very ceremonial place.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's a path that
leads up to where they're

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.090 align:middle line:90%
going to do the actual ritual.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And what they do
is they walk up.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.050 align:middle line:84%
They line this
path with crystals.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.470 align:middle line:84%
They have to walk
barefoot on the crystals

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:07.810 align:middle line:84%
to purify themselves before
they get to the ritual.

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.360 align:middle line:90%
And so they'll come.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.690 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, OK, these two
individuals are going to join.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And so they go walk
down this crystal path.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a huge
bonfire at the end of this.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And the bonfire signifies
we're getting rid of the old,

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.240 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
renew something.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And that starts the--
so we look at a flame,

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and we see these little things
come off of these flames,

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:35.650 align:middle line:90%
the tips of it.

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Those are the--
making the threads.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And then they talk about
weaving these threads that

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.000 align:middle line:84%
will be eternally these
two people woven together.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And so it doesn't matter
where they go in the cosmos.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.290 align:middle line:90%
They're still together.

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow, what
a beautiful ceremony

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:56.120 align:middle line:84%
to be able to look at somebody
that you've probably never met,

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.870 align:middle line:84%
but you know them because
you're in total alignment

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.390 align:middle line:90%
with their energies.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that,
you're telepathic.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:07.210 align:middle line:84%
So you can't lie about
what you're thinking.

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to
start that, so they

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.750 align:middle line:84%
say when they're
weaving these threads,

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:14.530 align:middle line:84%
it's taking everything that
their ancestors passed down

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.660 align:middle line:84%
to them and weaving
that into their lives.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is their art and
music involved with this?

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah, yeah,
it's very ceremonial.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.780 align:middle line:90%
They wear their best robes.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:31.940 align:middle line:84%
They talk about the exchange of
energies through the crystals.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.910 align:middle line:84%
But like I say, this tripantu
has a great meaning to them.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And it takes place
over these 12 days

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:39.710 align:middle line:84%
while this helical
cycle is occurring.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And they feel like
that when they

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:44.590 align:middle line:84%
weave these threads
together, and they

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:48.470 align:middle line:90%
are totally bound then as one.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how long does
that last, this binding?

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: The binding is
that will be the rest--

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.410 align:middle line:84%
and when the next
couple comes along

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.770 align:middle line:84%
as part of their lineage, then
whatever was bound in theirs

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:01.940 align:middle line:84%
will get transferred
to the next.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
begs them, really,

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:84%
what are you
transferring to them?

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not just symbology.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.180 align:middle line:84%
They're transferring
those energies

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:17.260 align:middle line:84%
that they've maintained
over those millions of years

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.580 align:middle line:90%
on down through their lineage.

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
way to continue that.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And so through this
tripantu, they're

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:28.420 align:middle line:84%
making sure that all
of those energies that

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.610 align:middle line:84%
were created from
the very beginning

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:33.770 align:middle line:84%
are continued down
through their line.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's pretty
powerful stuff if that's

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.470 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of
knowledge, and it's

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:42.840 align:middle line:84%
been captured through
all of these lifetimes,

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.700 align:middle line:90%
clear down to the beginning.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.470 align:middle line:90%
We're on Earth.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:50.450 align:middle line:84%
We lose 50 years of knowledge
with every generation.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Where did it go?

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Who's supposed to be
keeping track of that?

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.410 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that
they can go back,

00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and they can recite
their lineage.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.795 align:middle line:90%
And I can't even imagine that.

00:25:04.795 --> 00:25:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to
equate that to not only

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:13.100 align:middle line:84%
their past but their future, and
so we're looking at these things

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.810 align:middle line:84%
and going, we are
missing so much.

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And are we their past,
or are we their future?

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.080 align:middle line:90%
I think we're both.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's
going to happen

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:28.520 align:middle line:84%
is that we're going to
recognize our past through them,

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and that we're going to
recognize our future as them,

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and that this is just that
beginning process to get there.

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.580 align:middle line:84%
So I would love to have
cities like they have.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.060 align:middle line:84%
I would love to be
able to understand

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:46.270 align:middle line:90%
that my purpose is in my job.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: This body is
more than just the vehicle

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:57.190 align:middle line:84%
to convey a surround
that it is containing

00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:00.720 align:middle line:84%
viable sources of
energy that have

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.720 align:middle line:90%
such meaning across the cosmos.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.550 align:middle line:84%
We truly are connected
to one another.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:09.370 align:middle line:84%
People say, oh, I thought I had
an Arcturian talking in my head.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:11.130 align:middle line:90%
You probably did.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.440 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
convey a message to you

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:17.340 align:middle line:84%
that you need to have a more
spiritual aspect, that you

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:20.120 align:middle line:84%
need to be honoring the fact
that you're part of something

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:20.920 align:middle line:90%
bigger.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
we don't do that.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And you got to remember, they're
on the outside looking in.

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:29.170 align:middle line:90%
We're on the inside looking out.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And they have a bigger
comparison base than we do.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And so having said that, they're
able to look at us and say, wow,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.050 align:middle line:90%
you're still very young.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.270 align:middle line:84%
You haven't learned
those lessons yet.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.490 align:middle line:90%
And we need to.

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:44.532 align:middle line:90%
We need to come together.

00:26:44.532 --> 00:26:45.948 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what
kind of timeline

00:26:45.948 --> 00:26:47.330 align:middle line:90%
are they on compared to us?

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Well, interesting.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So they say we've
been to the rim.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.110 align:middle line:84%
We do not know what's
beyond the rim.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's interesting
because when

00:26:55.990 --> 00:27:00.820 align:middle line:84%
they say that, it sounds like
they suspect there's something

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:02.660 align:middle line:90%
more there.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.340 align:middle line:84%
They just don't
know what it is yet.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.840 align:middle line:90%
And is that their evolution?

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.640 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And why
they stopped there.

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah, I don't know.

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:15.040 align:middle line:84%
I think it has something to
do with a change in density.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it
probably has something

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.860 align:middle line:84%
to do with that they're still
discovering some unknowns.

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:22.360 align:middle line:84%
They don't know whether it's
going to have an effect on them

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.160 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:25.990 align:middle line:84%
From a scientific
point of view--

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I could see that, yeah.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.180 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:32.860 align:middle line:84%
My mind would go, wow,
what an opportunity.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Surely, the universal
source is going to say,

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.480 align:middle line:90%
I created to this space.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And whatever happens
after that is your input.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's really
what's going to happen

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:51.310 align:middle line:84%
is that it's going
to be whatever

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.060 align:middle line:90%
we are capable of imagining.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:54.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:57.140 align:middle line:90%
And so they've gone that far.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:01.078 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
know what to imagine,

00:28:01.078 --> 00:28:03.370 align:middle line:84%
then it's going to stay that
way until you figure out--

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: --activity will stop.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:05.470 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I find that very
fascinating that they would say,

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:11.260 align:middle line:90%
well, we've been to the rim.

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:14.450 align:middle line:84%
We just haven't discovered
what's past that.

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Fascinating
information.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Victoria, it's always lovely
to have you on the show.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:19.730 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, I
appreciate being here.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:25.780 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
