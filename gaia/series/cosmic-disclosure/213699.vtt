>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.740 align:middle line:10%
we are with Richard Doty, a
retired Special Agent who served

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.300 align:middle line:10%
in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO/ET-related

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.140 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Today, we discuss
Project Arc Weld.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD C. DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What is
Project Arc Weld?

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Project Arc Weld is a
government program to prepare

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.070 align:middle line:90%
for the future.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Looking into the future,
prepare the government,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.630 align:middle line:84%
prepare the United
States military

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.060 align:middle line:84%
for future events and
future operations.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And who's involved
with Project Arc Weld?

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: The government went
out and sought after people that

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.910 align:middle line:84%
were experts in clairvoyance,
paranormal, some remote viewers.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.350 align:middle line:84%
People had psychic
abilities, and these people

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.260 align:middle line:84%
were brought in not
just military personnel,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.220 align:middle line:84%
but civilians given
a contract or brought

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:84%
into the Civil Service portion
of the United States government

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and given a security
clearance after a background.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And they set up different
seminars for these people

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:84%
to brainstorm what would
happen or what we could

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.590 align:middle line:90%
expect from future events.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's part of Arc Weld.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.230 align:middle line:84%
These people had unique
abilities, a lot of them,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.990 align:middle line:84%
and they could see-- some
clairvoyant people could

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.080 align:middle line:84%
see into the future and they
would provide the government

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.120 align:middle line:84%
with what their conception
was looking into that future.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:90%
Pretty straightforward.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.270 align:middle line:84%
They just wanted them
to look into the future

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.590 align:middle line:84%
and they do it in
an interval time.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Like look 10 years into the
future, 20 years, whatever,

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.890 align:middle line:90%
and on and on.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Again, I don't know
the entire program,

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.440 align:middle line:84%
but that's the basics
of the program,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:84%
to prepare the United
States military and defense

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.610 align:middle line:84%
community for whatever we
have to face into the future.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And that was Project
Arc Weld, and that

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.800 align:middle line:84%
was a goal of
Project Arc Weld, is

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.350 align:middle line:84%
to bring people in
that were clairvoyant

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.770 align:middle line:84%
and have the ability
to foresee the future.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what
agency controls Arc Weld?

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Defense
Intelligence Agency.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And how do they
pick these individuals out?

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Just for their testing, or was
there some other special thing

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.960 align:middle line:90%
about them?

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: They developed a
screening process for personnel,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.890 align:middle line:84%
and back then it was
only military personnel.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.360 align:middle line:84%
But they developed
the screening process,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.840 align:middle line:84%
people that had unique
abilities or psychic abilities.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And so they used that same
selection process for Arc Weld.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.600 align:middle line:84%
But they also realized that not
only grown-ups or adults were

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.110 align:middle line:84%
capable of these things, but
they found during the selection

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:84%
process that some of the
family members of these people

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:84%
that they were screening were
as good or not or even better

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.410 align:middle line:90%
than they were.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So they actually
brought in children

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.840 align:middle line:84%
as young as 14 years old
that were clairvoyant

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:84%
or they had astral projection
ability, unique abilities.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And so they brought them in and
they trained them, of course,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.360 align:middle line:84%
under the direct supervision
of their parents.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is there any
particular psychic agent that

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.580 align:middle line:84%
stands out that you'd
like to mention?

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: There's several.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:38.810 align:middle line:90%
There's several.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I
have to be very careful

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.480 align:middle line:84%
because some of them are still
working for the government.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.080 align:middle line:84%
But during this process,
the selection process,

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.940 align:middle line:84%
they found that
some of these people

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:84%
had such unique abilities that
they started questioning them,

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.220 align:middle line:84%
exactly who they were
or where they came from,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.160 align:middle line:90%
whether they were all human.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.700 align:middle line:84%
At that time, in that
particular time period,

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.010 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have the
ability or the knowledge

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.040 align:middle line:84%
that they later had
on how to determine

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.160 align:middle line:84%
whether a human-looking
person was,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.850 align:middle line:84%
in fact, a hybrid or masking
as an extraterrestrial.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:84%
So that really
presented a problem

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.250 align:middle line:84%
for the Defense Intelligence
Agency, who was involved

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.290 align:middle line:90%
in this program of Arc Weld.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.550 align:middle line:84%
So then now they had
to brainstorm and use

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.430 align:middle line:84%
scientific principles, and
medical doctors brought them in

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.740 align:middle line:84%
to try to screen or
develop a screening

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:84%
process for these people
who they think might

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.040 align:middle line:90%
be something other than humans.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So how do they make
this jump from being psychic

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.310 align:middle line:84%
to possibly being
not completely human?

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, they used the
remote viewers and they used

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.280 align:middle line:84%
people who developed the
remote-viewing process to screen

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.520 align:middle line:84%
these applicants, so
to speak, one-on-one.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And as they were screening
one-on-one, when you sit down

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.590 align:middle line:84%
with another person directly
across, like we are here today,

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:84%
you can detect a lot of
things that you couldn't

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.080 align:middle line:84%
do if you were in
a group of people

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.370 align:middle line:84%
in a room with a classroom
of 20 or 30 people.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.880 align:middle line:84%
So they did
one-on-one interviews.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And these people that were doing
these one-on-one interviews

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.160 align:middle line:84%
had all been involved in
the remote-viewing process

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.230 align:middle line:90%
and training of remote viewers.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.595 align:middle line:84%
And they detected things,
traits of that humans,

00:05:38.595 --> 00:05:42.420 align:middle line:84%
such as movements and
how their ears can move

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.040 align:middle line:84%
or how they can talk or how
they react to certain questions.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they started
developing questions,

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.480 align:middle line:90%
questions that--

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and that was hard to understand
for us as human beings,

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.830 align:middle line:84%
but developed questions
that only a human--

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.080 align:middle line:90%
now you think about this now.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I am.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Only a human could
answer questions about history

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.880 align:middle line:84%
or questions about things on
Earth and question about family

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.290 align:middle line:90%
ancestries.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's where
they caught him.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.090 align:middle line:84%
When they talked about
the family ancestry,

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.550 align:middle line:84%
they realized there
was a problem.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they're centered on.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And when these
applicants couldn't

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.620 align:middle line:84%
answer simple questions
about their family tree

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:84%
or about where their
family came from

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.010 align:middle line:84%
or their history
of their family,

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.820 align:middle line:84%
they knew that
there was a problem.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Were those applicants
actually aware that they might

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.100 align:middle line:90%
be hybrid?

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.310 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Some of them did.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And some of what they
found was that some of them

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.230 align:middle line:84%
were, in fact, extraterrestrials
posing as human beings.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And they've done that-- for they
were 30 or 40-year-old humans.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.740 align:middle line:84%
But they were, in
fact, at some point

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.790 align:middle line:84%
a hybrid that was more
extraterrestrial than human

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:84%
or more human than
extraterrestrial.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
already knew it.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.220 align:middle line:84%
They had a realization
at some point

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.990 align:middle line:84%
during their upbringing that
they're being controlled

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:84%
by not human beings, but
from extraterrestrials,

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.760 align:middle line:90%
from wherever they came from.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And that presented
a major problem

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:84%
for the Defense
Intelligence Agency.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And now they have to
develop different techniques

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.860 align:middle line:90%
and different screening process.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And then what are
we going to do?

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:84%
What are they going to do with
these people or humans that

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.930 align:middle line:84%
are hybrids that know
they're extraterrestrials?

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the other side
of that, as you ask,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.300 align:middle line:84%
there were some that didn't
know they were hybrids,

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.820 align:middle line:84%
but the realization
that they were hybrids

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.590 align:middle line:84%
came out during the
screening process.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And that presented a problem
not only to DIA but to them.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So, Richard, how
do you define a hybrid?

00:07:54.450 --> 00:08:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: A hybrid is an embryo
that was taken from a human

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:06.240 align:middle line:84%
and mixed with
extraterrestrial DNA.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And developed from the
womb or outside the womb.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.280 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials
have the ability--

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.190 align:middle line:84%
you hear this abduction
cases all along,

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:21.940 align:middle line:84%
that these abductees see these
vats with human embryos growing.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly how the
extraterrestrials do it.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:30.480 align:middle line:84%
They take the embryo, they
attach the extraterrestrial DNA,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.890 align:middle line:90%
and they grow.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.669 align:middle line:84%
They appear to be human,
but in actuality, they're

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.260 align:middle line:90%
part-human and part-hybrid.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, even as I understand
this, and this was sensitive,

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.100 align:middle line:84%
even the
extraterrestrials, they're

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.450 align:middle line:90%
dealing with a human embryo.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't know exactly
how this thing is going

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.230 align:middle line:90%
to turn out, as I understood.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Some of these embryos
turn out to be

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
more extraterrestrial-looking
than human-looking.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And OK, now, what do
you do with those?

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, they have the ability.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.110 align:middle line:90%
They're advanced.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:84%
They're thousands of years more
advanced in genetic ability

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:10.190 align:middle line:90%
than we are.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:16.100 align:middle line:84%
They're then able to manipulate
the structure of that embryo

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.570 align:middle line:84%
once it's born into
that of a human,

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:25.210 align:middle line:84%
but it still carries
the traits, interior--

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.660 align:middle line:84%
internal traits, of
an extraterrestrial.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And the example of this is one
of the 14-year-olds that they

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:38.050 align:middle line:84%
were dealing with that was a
member of this family of psychic

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.920 align:middle line:90%
people with psychic ability.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.640 align:middle line:84%
They examined,
physically examined-- now

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.940 align:middle line:84%
this is back before
MRIs and CAT scans.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: When was
Project Arc Weld--

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.960 align:middle line:84%
just for the audience--
actually what year was that?

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: That was in
the mid '70s, mid '70s.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And so they didn't have all the
techniques that we have today,

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.690 align:middle line:84%
but they had x-rays and they had
some other abilities to look.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, when they did basic
x-rays on this 14 year old,

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.400 align:middle line:84%
they realized her organs
were in the same place

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.850 align:middle line:90%
that a human organs were.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And she had something else
inside her, another organ.

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.960 align:middle line:90%
They had no idea what it was.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, they realized that
14-year-old is more

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.630 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial than human.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably why she
had so many unique abilities

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:31.630 align:middle line:84%
to foresee things, psychic
ability to move things

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.550 align:middle line:90%
that others didn't have.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And then as we learn
more about these people,

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:41.020 align:middle line:84%
about these hybrids,
the more advanced

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:46.082 align:middle line:84%
that we started experimenting
to determine how they became--

00:10:46.082 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Like how they modified
the genetics so they looked like

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.657 align:middle line:84%
a human, but internally and
psychically and probably

00:10:52.657 --> 00:10:54.740 align:middle line:84%
their whole neural system
is completely different?

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.073 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Exactly, and they
did all sorts of other tests,

00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:58.108 align:middle line:90%
medical tests.

00:10:58.108 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a doctor and
I can't understand it.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.180 align:middle line:84%
You probably would do
more, could understand it

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:03.980 align:middle line:90%
more than I could.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.820 align:middle line:84%
But they did tests
like injecting things

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.920 align:middle line:84%
into their body, through
a vein or an artery,

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.250 align:middle line:84%
and watching it on a fluoroscopy
or whatever they call it.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at a human,
it flows in a certain way.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.350 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
extraterrestrial,

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.220 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't flow
in that same way.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Something catches that
because it's a foreign body.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:30.050 align:middle line:84%
They have the ability to fight
or collect foreign substances,

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.862 align:middle line:90%
which we can't.

00:11:30.862 --> 00:11:33.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's going to flow
through our bodies and our veins

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.810 align:middle line:84%
and arteries and capillaries,
where in the extraterrestrial--

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: There's like
reservoirs for these whatever

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.310 align:middle line:84%
toxins or whatever
they want to, you know,

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.110 align:middle line:84%
they can control that in
their circulatory system.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Exactly they have
this unique reservoir that we

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.520 align:middle line:90%
don't have.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:55.082 align:middle line:84%
And so now they realize, oh my
god, this thing is not a human.

00:11:55.082 --> 00:11:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And then the big
question right now

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.530 align:middle line:84%
is, what are they going
to do with these hybrids?

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: When you talk
about extraterrestrials,

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.950 align:middle line:90%
do you even know which ones?

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, everything
is compartmented.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And the information
that I had access to

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.020 align:middle line:84%
didn't specifically
address that.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.310 align:middle line:90%
But they were talking almost--

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you could read.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.190 align:middle line:90%
I knew about the Ebens.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.630 align:middle line:84%
At that particular time
period, I knew about the Ebens,

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.840 align:middle line:84%
I knew about some other races,
but I didn't know about all

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.390 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know the
description of all of them

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:29.770 align:middle line:84%
other than the DIA names of
the quantaloids, haploids,

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:30.830 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And so what they
were talking about

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.840 align:middle line:90%
were the Ebens, the Grey Ebens.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have another Grey race
that some people mix up with,

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.100 align:middle line:90%
which I mix up sometimes.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So they're primarily
dealing with the Ebens.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And this, of course, presented
other problems for us.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, what kind of
problems are you talking about?

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: As we started
investigating contactees,

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.940 align:middle line:84%
experiencers, people who've
had face to face contact with

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.170 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials, we realized
that not all these contacts were

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.300 align:middle line:90%
friendly contacts.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And when they described
the particular appearance

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:15.460 align:middle line:84%
of this extraterrestrial, they
were describing the Ebens.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was the government
concerned now that we have

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:24.180 align:middle line:84%
humans, hybrid humans, possibly
the extraterrestrial part

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.380 align:middle line:84%
of that human could
be malevolent?

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.905 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: True, we did.

00:13:27.905 --> 00:13:29.270 align:middle line:90%
DIA did.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And in those early days, there
wasn't a particular division

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.900 align:middle line:84%
or bureau or directorate
within any government agency,

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.720 align:middle line:84%
intelligence agency,
that investigated

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.940 align:middle line:90%
contactees or experiencers.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And so DIA developed one
just because of this reason,

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:54.430 align:middle line:84%
to go out and seek these
contactees and experiencers,

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:57.470 align:middle line:84%
and investigate what
they're telling us.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And so there were agents
trained within DIA,

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:84%
a particular division of
DIA, that were trained

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.320 align:middle line:84%
and asking the right
questions and being

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:16.090 align:middle line:84%
able to interrogate or interview
these contactees or experiencers

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.890 align:middle line:90%
and have them tell their story.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Could you allude to
the audience how would these

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:26.330 align:middle line:84%
agents track these
individuals down?

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, there
are ways to do it.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:33.713 align:middle line:84%
And that, unfortunately, is
not something I had access to.

00:14:33.713 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And even if I did, I don't know
that I could ever talk about it.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Of course.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.770 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.260 align:middle line:84%
So was this tracking
part of Arc Weld

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.480 align:middle line:84%
or is it a separate thing,
a different project?

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: That was
a separate project.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.707 align:middle line:90%
It developed out of Arc Weld.

00:14:46.707 --> 00:14:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Right, out of Arc Weld
because that's what you found

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.810 align:middle line:84%
out that there are hybrid
human beings on the planet.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Right, but the
operation or the project

00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:01.770 align:middle line:84%
to track them and find them and
interrogate them is an entirely

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:03.660 align:middle line:90%
different operation.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Once they
learn they're hybrids,

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:09.700 align:middle line:84%
is this a positive or a negative
concern for the government?

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, what they did
was once they identified this

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:20.970 align:middle line:84%
applicant as a hybrid, the
government was able to isolate

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
that select few that could cause
damage to the United States

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.250 align:middle line:84%
government, and that's the
way they approached it.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.990 align:middle line:84%
They approached it as a
national security issue.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:33.870 align:middle line:84%
They said, now, these
particular beings

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:37.920 align:middle line:84%
could be detrimental
to national security.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So we just can't let
them go out in society.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was they
set up a program where

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.740 align:middle line:84%
they isolated them,
telling them they're

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:90%
going into a special group.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And so they isolated them,
they put him in some facilities

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:55.140 align:middle line:90%
where they could watch them.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And during that time period that
they're watching these known

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:84%
hybrids, the government
perfected some techniques

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.170 align:middle line:90%
to track him.

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And those tracking techniques
are used to keep track of them

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.420 align:middle line:90%
and watch them.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:84%
So if they disappeared
and went someplace else,

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:90%
we would know it.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And there were
instances, one instance

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:23.280 align:middle line:84%
that I know of, that one
particular man, woman,

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.420 align:middle line:90%
and child--

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.670 align:middle line:84%
now, it wasn't the 14 year
old, it was another child.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.120 align:middle line:90%
It was, I think 17, 16 or 17.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.800 align:middle line:84%
That three-member family got
out of the detention facility,

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And they were around the
Washington, D.C. area.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Now, that presented a problem.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So they activated
a team of people,

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:47.750 align:middle line:84%
of FBI agents and intelligence
officers to track them,

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.573 align:middle line:90%
track that family.

00:16:48.573 --> 00:16:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Richard, let's
back up a little bit.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.090 align:middle line:84%
How could they just leave
the detention center?

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:54.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a highly secured area.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I'm not sure
how they got out.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know that we
know how they got out,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.510 align:middle line:84%
but we knew where
they were going

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:84%
because we could
track them and they

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:05.859 align:middle line:84%
were going to a residence in
Virginia, in Vienna, Virginia.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:10.319 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know all
the details exactly,

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:11.800 align:middle line:84%
but we knew they
were going there.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how we
knew they were going there.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.880 align:middle line:84%
But we set up, the government
set up an operation

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.000 align:middle line:90%
to catch them there.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.099 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, with the
cooperation of this intelligence

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:26.339 align:middle line:84%
collection team, they call
it, they caught up with them

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:30.180 align:middle line:84%
and they captured them and
brought them back to a facility

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.840 align:middle line:90%
that they could be housed in.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.173 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Did they go willingly?

00:17:33.173 --> 00:17:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: There was some form
of a confrontation, yes.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.340 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know
the whole details.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.740 align:middle line:84%
But there-- and
because of that, now

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.750 align:middle line:84%
we know that the
techniques that we

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:48.730 align:middle line:84%
developed to track these
hybrids worked because we did

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:49.530 align:middle line:90%
track them.

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So now, we knew
how to track them.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, this also presented
a major problem

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:84%
because we realized that
these people that came in

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:84%
that we selected for
Arc Weld couldn't

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.950 align:middle line:90%
be the only hybrids out there.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:07.910 align:middle line:10%
So we knew there were hybrids
that intermingled with society.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And maybe not just
American society,

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.967 align:middle line:90%
maybe the world population.

00:18:13.967 --> 00:18:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You have
a detention center,

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:19.310 align:middle line:84%
you have all of these applicants
from Project Arc Weld.

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Those were all
able to be tracked.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.680 align:middle line:84%
But could you track
ones that did not

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.460 align:middle line:90%
go through the Arc Weld system?

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.460 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, that
was developed later.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:84%
That was part of the
Katie Schmidt story.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.220 align:middle line:84%
So at this particular
time period,

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.660 align:middle line:84%
and we're still in the late '70s
and maybe really early '80s, we

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:43.090 align:middle line:84%
knew DIA, CIA knew, and there
were select people within

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:45.970 align:middle line:84%
the FBI in a foreign
counterintelligence division

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.800 align:middle line:90%
that knew that we had hybrids.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, what are we going
to do about that?

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have to address that
issue, because are they friends

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.740 align:middle line:90%
or are they foe?

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.640 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing--
friend or foe?

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a complex problem,
dilemma for the government.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
they're out there.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
this brings up,

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.990 align:middle line:84%
the big, big, big
question is, how many

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:15.470 align:middle line:84%
hybrids have infiltrated the
intelligence community or the US

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:16.550 align:middle line:90%
military?

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:21.020 align:middle line:10%
And that was one of the
most worrying problems

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.180 align:middle line:10%
that the new president
of the United

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.310 align:middle line:10%
States at that time, President
Reagan, was briefed on.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what are they
doing here and why are they

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:29.750 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:30.952 align:middle line:90%
What's their agenda?

00:19:30.952 --> 00:19:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: That's the question.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.743 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: That's a
huge investigation.

00:19:33.743 --> 00:19:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And are they
winning or unwinning?

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:37.340 align:middle line:90%
And then we found--

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.670 align:middle line:84%
during Arc Weld, they found
that some of these hybrids

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.060 align:middle line:90%
didn't know they were hybrids.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.340 align:middle line:90%
Some did.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the more DNA or the
more extraterrestrial they have,

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.640 align:middle line:84%
material they have in them,
the more they're aware.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.237 align:middle line:84%
The brain functions are
different, and I mean,

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the whole
medical part of that,

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.740 align:middle line:90%
but they realize that they are.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.430 align:middle line:90%
Now they have to mask that.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And then there's techniques,
defensive techniques

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:09.130 align:middle line:84%
that we developed to determine
whether they're masking.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But then again,
on the other hand,

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.010 align:middle line:84%
there are some that didn't
know they were hybrid

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:15.210 align:middle line:90%
until they're identified.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And what they had
to do then was they

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:23.570 align:middle line:84%
had to bring in another program
to facilitate these hybrids

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and tell them in some
way that, you know

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.610 align:middle line:90%
what, you're not all human.

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Because they might
not know that.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And then obviously, if
you were to tell somebody,

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.410 align:middle line:84%
if I was to tell you,
you're not human,

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:40.820 align:middle line:84%
you have alien DNA in you, how
are you going to react to that?

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:45.248 align:middle line:84%
So those are all problems that
the government has to deal with.

00:20:45.248 --> 00:20:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And during that time period,
they were dealing with it.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are you aware
of any hybrids working

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:84%
in the government after
that, that you guys were able

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.540 align:middle line:84%
to capture or make
aware of, I'll say?

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Katie Schmidt
was the first one.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And we had an entire show on
that here on Katie Schmidt.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And later, she knew, she
brought to our attention

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.390 align:middle line:84%
because she was an
intelligence officer.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.780 align:middle line:84%
She brought to
our attention, I'm

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.850 align:middle line:84%
sorry to say that
I'm part-hybrid.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Because she would be contacted
by the extraterrestrials

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:26.760 align:middle line:84%
and examined and influenced by
them, not against the United

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.160 align:middle line:84%
States government or
the world government,

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:34.750 align:middle line:84%
but made to reveal to her
that she's one of them.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And that she
explained that to us.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And because of Katie Schmidt,
we develop new techniques--

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.500 align:middle line:84%
DNA, tissue samples,
vitreous fluids out

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:84%
of the eye, the vitreous
out of the eyes,

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and they're entirely different
than human vitreous fluids,

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:51.940 align:middle line:90%
and other things.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And she was cordially
working with us to help us with

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.940 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:55.773 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Absolutely.

00:21:55.773 --> 00:21:57.487 align:middle line:90%
She was cooperating 100%.

00:21:57.487 --> 00:21:59.820 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I don't
know that we ever talked about

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.400 align:middle line:84%
during the Katie Schmidt story
was because of her, there

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.710 align:middle line:84%
was a new technique for
polygraph examinations.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Because if you give a hybrid
and a polygraph examination,

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.750 align:middle line:90%
they cannot tell the lie.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:16.910 align:middle line:84%
So every polygraph is going to
show no deception indicated.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, she developed,
because of her,

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.410 align:middle line:84%
how the questions
can be manipulated

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:27.440 align:middle line:84%
to bring out the truth
or a lie from a hybrid.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And that was something that
was sensitive for a long time.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: When you have a hybrid
working for the government,

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.402 align:middle line:84%
how are they going
to accept that?

00:22:36.402 --> 00:22:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: The first
one that I knew about,

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.810 align:middle line:84%
and maybe there were others
that I don't know about--

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:41.143 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Sure, sure, of course.

00:22:41.143 --> 00:22:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: But the Katie
Schmidt story made or brought

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.180 align:middle line:84%
to the realization of the
intelligence community that we

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:84%
probably have been
penetrated by these hybrids.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.630 align:middle line:84%
At least one, we
have one right here.

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And she's 100%
cooperative with us.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And so because of her,
because of Katie Schmidt,

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:05.680 align:middle line:84%
and because of what she accepted
and what she agreed to do,

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.940 align:middle line:84%
we took all sorts of
medical tests, DNA.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Although the DNA was new back
in those days, we knew it,

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:15.980 align:middle line:84%
the government knew it, the
civilian population didn't.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:20.560 align:middle line:84%
The things, they took tissue
samples from different organs,

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.930 align:middle line:84%
her uterus, her eye,
I mean, everything.

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And then they developed a
technique to screen people.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem is, how do
you screen somebody that's

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.200 align:middle line:84%
been working for the
intelligence community for 15

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.300 align:middle line:84%
years and you think that
they may be a hybrid?

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So you have to develop
some cover story.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And so the cover story
was a blood testing.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Every single intelligence
officer after 1983

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.920 align:middle line:84%
had to get a blood test to make
sure, especially the ones that

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.720 align:middle line:90%
went overseas.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.160 align:middle line:90%
But all of them got them.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.030 align:middle line:84%
The story was, the
cover story is, listen,

00:23:58.030 --> 00:23:59.630 align:middle line:84%
you guys are
intelligence officers,

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.720 align:middle line:84%
we want to make sure you don't
have anything in your system.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to take
your blood, do a blood test,

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.350 align:middle line:84%
take two vials of blood,
because I had it done to me.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And then it was
shipped off someplace.

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And there was some
high level doctors

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.680 align:middle line:84%
that developed
techniques to determine

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.190 align:middle line:90%
what these blood types were.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And ironically, I
don't know the numbers,

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.665 align:middle line:84%
but ironically, there
were a lot of positive.

00:24:23.665 --> 00:24:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How
about a percentage?

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:25.840 align:middle line:90%
Could you tell us?

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I would say
probably 20% to 25%.

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: My goodness gracious.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:31.248 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And they've
already been--

00:24:31.248 --> 00:24:34.220 align:middle line:84%
some of them have been
around for 20, 25 years.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:35.360 align:middle line:90%
That's the question.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Back in the days, the
early days of the--

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.580 align:middle line:84%
CIA came in existence in 1947,
the National Security Act,

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:49.260 align:middle line:84%
the actual first class of CIA
personnel graduated in 1940,

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.985 align:middle line:90%
late '48 and '49.

00:24:50.985 --> 00:24:52.110 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have any testing.

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:54.540 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know anything
about hybrids back then.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.280 align:middle line:90%
So how many snuck in?

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And again, another question
that's really interesting

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.860 align:middle line:84%
is how long is this
have been occurring?

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.760 align:middle line:90%
Is this thousands of years?

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.700 align:middle line:90%
Hundreds of years?

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And how is the CIA
going to implement these new

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:10.980 align:middle line:90%
people?

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Are they're going
to confront them?

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:16.310 align:middle line:84%
What's the protocol
once that happens?

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, they know 20%, 30% of
the intelligence community

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.820 align:middle line:90%
is a hybrid.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And now they must have some
sort of another program to say,

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.680 align:middle line:90%
this is what we have to do now.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, that's something
I was never involved with.

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:30.760 align:middle line:90%
And so I don't know.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.740 align:middle line:84%
But I can imagine-- now, we're
not just dealing with CIA or DIA

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:39.510 align:middle line:84%
or-- we're dealing in NSA, we're
doing military intelligence,

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:43.320 align:middle line:84%
intelligence command, OSI,
Air Force Intelligence,

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Office of Naval intelligence,
even Coast Guard.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How about
government, senate, presidents?

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yeah.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.070 align:middle line:90%
Not even considering that.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way of us,
the intelligence community,

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:55.230 align:middle line:90%
testing them.

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they do that now.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.570 align:middle line:84%
I know that every
single recruit that

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:03.630 align:middle line:84%
comes through basic training
is tested with shots.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have these ID
factors that you know about,

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:12.060 align:middle line:84%
that they can detect out
of a blood, the RH factor

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.180 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand that.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, but if they're
already in, like you

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:20.740 align:middle line:90%
ask, what do you do with them?

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, you tested them
in 1983 and you

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.310 align:middle line:84%
found that there's X number of
intelligence officers working

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:28.650 align:middle line:84%
within the government,
25% or whatever

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:30.820 align:middle line:90%
it was that are hybrids.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:31.900 align:middle line:90%
What do you do with them?

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a good question.

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:35.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Katie Schmidt, I worked
with, I trusted her.

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.080 align:middle line:90%
We were on operations together.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.720 align:middle line:84%
She never swayed
from the mission.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.450 align:middle line:84%
She never tried to
manipulate the mission.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:52.175 align:middle line:84%
But then again, some of these
missions were against her--

00:26:52.175 --> 00:26:52.975 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Her kind.

00:26:52.975 --> 00:26:53.775 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Her kind.

00:26:53.775 --> 00:26:56.210 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's the question now.

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Have they infiltrated our
government, intelligence

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.120 align:middle line:84%
community and the military,
too, they're probably--

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what the
percentage is for hybrids being

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.810 align:middle line:84%
in the military, not
intelligence, just soldiers,

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:10.400 align:middle line:90%
infantry officers or whatever.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:15.350 align:middle line:84%
But what they wanted to do and
what they were worried about

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:21.020 align:middle line:84%
was, OK, if she's a quantaloid
or haploid or an Eben,

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:26.410 align:middle line:84%
and we have to go after them,
is she going to be loyal to us?

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Or is she going to
be loyal to them?

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And that was a question
that was always in my mind.

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And I actually
confronted her once.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:36.170 align:middle line:84%
We were doing
something similar--

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:37.910 align:middle line:84%
I can't go into
details, but something

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:39.410 align:middle line:90%
to do with extraterrestrials.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And we were at a place and
a really remote location

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:47.310 align:middle line:90%
and we were watching something.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her, I mean,
we're sitting in a vehicle

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and not much else to do,
the surveillance operation.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her, I came right
out and asked her, what would

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:58.560 align:middle line:90%
you do?

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.090 align:middle line:90%
I want to ask you a question.

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:06.190 align:middle line:84%
I said, if this turns
out to be an Eben,

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:09.570 align:middle line:84%
are you going to be in
front of me or behind me?

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Meaning is she going
to have my back.

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are you going
to be compromised?

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And she said, I have
a mission to do, Richard,

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
do that mission.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So we never had to get
into that situation

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.970 align:middle line:84%
where she had to
make a decision.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:26.930 align:middle line:84%
But that always-- that
question was always in my mind.

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And now, you're
talking in the future.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.580 align:middle line:84%
You have a battle, OK, we're
talking about the future.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:36.700 align:middle line:84%
What if we have an invasion
from the extraterrestrials,

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:40.280 align:middle line:84%
the haploids or quantaloids
or transloids or whoever?

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And we have X number
of military personnel

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.470 align:middle line:90%
who are hybrids from that race?

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to put their
guns down and walk away?

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Or are they going
to fight their own?

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.403 align:middle line:84%
That's a question I
don't have an answer to.

00:28:51.403 --> 00:28:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I mean, they
could just be sleepers,

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.770 align:middle line:90%
just like terrorist groups.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:56.175 align:middle line:90%
Terrorists are everywhere.

00:28:56.175 --> 00:28:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: That's true.

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You know, I think it
would be a great concern if I

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:03.160 align:middle line:84%
was a soldier out there or
leading a platoon or even

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.950 align:middle line:84%
leading an entire
three-letter agency,

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:10.160 align:middle line:84%
not knowing if you could
trust 30% of the manpower.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah and this
isn't common knowledge.

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, people within
the intelligence community

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:22.630 align:middle line:84%
don't know this and they're
working alongside of a hybrid

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and they're in a situation
in Yemen or in wherever.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And are you going to
trust this person?

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Or they're in
Antarctica, knowing

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:35.170 align:middle line:84%
that there's a particular base
for the extraterrestrials,

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and now we're going
after their own.

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to be
behind me, have my back

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.980 align:middle line:90%
or have their back or not?

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Richard, you mentioned
this percentage of hybrids out

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:47.390 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And you guys have a
tracking method, finally.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Once you track them
and contain them,

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:00.000 align:middle line:84%
how do you get them back
into Project Arc Weld?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: We brought them in
after they were considered

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:03.530 align:middle line:90%
trusted persons.

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I see.

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And we put them through
some tests to determine whether

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:08.530 align:middle line:90%
they're trusted.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:12.090 align:middle line:84%
But their mission
at that point wasn't

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:15.720 align:middle line:84%
necessarily to gather
intelligence or share

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.680 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Their mission was to
foresee the future.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:23.880 align:middle line:84%
How we plan, how the United
States military, the Pentagon,

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.980 align:middle line:84%
the Department of Defense,
the CIA plan for the future?

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:33.030 align:middle line:84%
We wanted them-- and what we
did, we brought them in groups

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and we put them in
different scenarios.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And to almost remote
view, for better words,

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.900 align:middle line:84%
remote view the future,
to look into the future

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.740 align:middle line:84%
to determine what we have
to face into the future

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and develop operational
plans for the future

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.390 align:middle line:90%
based on what they see.

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, to do that, I don't
think that would jeopardize,

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:59.070 align:middle line:84%
even if they were hybrids,
the quantaloids, the most

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:02.430 align:middle line:84%
dangerous ones, I don't think
that would affect us in any way

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.090 align:middle line:84%
because you're looking
into the future.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they look in the future
and see that their own kind was

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:11.545 align:middle line:84%
going to attack, obviously, they
probably wouldn't change what--

00:31:11.545 --> 00:31:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Would
that change them?

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: They may.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.140 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think they
had a worry about that

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.210 align:middle line:84%
because the procedures
that they were using,

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:23.550 align:middle line:84%
they're teamed up with somebody
that they know is not a hybrid.

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And I can't go into that, other
than there's one that could be

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.250 align:middle line:90%
and one that's definitely not.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And so one's watching,
the non is watching.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I see.

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: We have a trusted
person, we know is trusted,

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:41.220 align:middle line:90%
that can pass a polygraph.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.720 align:middle line:84%
We have a hybrid that
probably can pass a polygraph

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.480 align:middle line:90%
but we can't really say.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.530 align:middle line:90%
And so this person is trusted.

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So if they're both
viewing the future

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and they're both returning
with going through the future,

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.550 align:middle line:84%
looking back, and writing their
reports and they're the same,

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:02.810 align:middle line:90%
then there's no problem.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How is the Arc
Weld technique different than

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:07.330 align:middle line:90%
the psychic technique?

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, there's
remote viewing,

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and then there's this
particular view into the future.

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:16.450 align:middle line:84%
As I understood,
and again, I'm not

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:19.670 align:middle line:84%
a psychiatrist or psychologist,
they're different.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:21.110 align:middle line:90%
They're entirely different.

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:25.090 align:middle line:84%
A clairvoyant person can
see things differently

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:26.360 align:middle line:90%
than a remote viewer.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.800 align:middle line:90%
And so they're separated.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:28.600 align:middle line:90%
They're different.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.680 align:middle line:90%
They're distinct.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.370 align:middle line:90%
They're not near the same.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So I just know that the
clairvoyant person or the person

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.550 align:middle line:84%
that can see the future that
they've recruited in Arc Weld

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:43.180 align:middle line:84%
uses different techniques
than the remote viewer.

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's about all I
could answer to that.

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Richard, you
mentioned many times

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:51.790 align:middle line:84%
that this program is used
to look into the future.

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:54.452 align:middle line:84%
So what future can
you tell us about?

00:32:54.452 --> 00:32:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, I never
read any of the reports,

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:58.880 align:middle line:84%
but I know that they
did it in intervals.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.830 align:middle line:90%
They would look 10 years.

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:03.010 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a 10-year
period at a time.

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:07.540 align:middle line:84%
10-year, 20-year, 30, I
think up to even 100 years

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:12.670 align:middle line:84%
into the future, as deep into
the future as these clairvoyant

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:14.500 align:middle line:90%
persons can do.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm sure each one of
them had different abilities.

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And so some may be able
to view 1,000 years,

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.610 align:middle line:84%
but maybe some could
only view 40 or 50.

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And they would write
reports exactly what

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:32.350 align:middle line:90%
they saw or diagrams, sketches.

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Vast amount of information
came out of them.

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, I never
read any of that stuff.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:39.980 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't-- I didn't
have a need to know it.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.460 align:middle line:84%
But I know that they've
gathered all that information.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And based on what these
people saw into the future,

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:54.130 align:middle line:84%
the United States Department of
Defense established operational

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:55.555 align:middle line:90%
plans--

00:33:55.555 --> 00:33:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Based off
of those reports?

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Operational plans, yes.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Can seeing into the
future affected in any way like

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Back to the Future, you know?

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I understand there
are some ways to manipulate

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:09.670 align:middle line:84%
the future, and that's
a different program.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:13.110 align:middle line:90%
But Arc Weld looks into it.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we want to
manipulate the future,

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:19.949 align:middle line:84%
there's another operational
plan that the NRO has,

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:22.570 align:middle line:84%
the National
Reconnaissance Office has.

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:25.510 align:middle line:84%
I know it exists, but I
don't know the details.

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:32.409 align:middle line:84%
But Arc Weld is to look
to see, and if we see it,

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:34.880 align:middle line:84%
how do you manipulate
it, how do you stop it?

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.318 align:middle line:84%
That goes to something else,
that goes to another program.

00:34:37.318 --> 00:34:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, I know our
audience is going to ask this

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:40.900 align:middle line:90%
question.

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.120 align:middle line:84%
They're going to want
to know how can they

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:48.170 align:middle line:84%
tell if they're a hybrid or
their loved one is a hybrid?

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: It's a good question.

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:52.850 align:middle line:84%
If I was to answer
that on air, I

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:54.350 align:middle line:84%
think there would
be a lot of people

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:57.448 align:middle line:84%
out there trying to
manipulate and do things

00:34:57.448 --> 00:34:59.990 align:middle line:84%
that they shouldn't be doing
because they're not professional

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.790 align:middle line:90%
at it.

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:02.810 align:middle line:84%
If they think they
are, they need

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:06.620 align:middle line:84%
to contact somebody, number
one, that's a clairvoyant.

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Somebody that's an
experiencer or a contactee

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.190 align:middle line:90%
and discuss that with them.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I think
that's a great idea,

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:14.900 align:middle line:90%
without getting into too much.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Is Arc Weld still
an active program?

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I believe it is,
yes, it's still active.

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do these hybrids
have a role in disclosure?

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Absolutely.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:27.650 align:middle line:84%
If they are known hybrids
and they know they are,

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.920 align:middle line:84%
they have been identified
as being a hybrid

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.440 align:middle line:84%
and they're well aware
of it, they certainly

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.670 align:middle line:90%
have a role in disclosure.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine if a hybrid
came in front of a camera

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:47.360 align:middle line:84%
in a Senate or a House
hearing and explain

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:51.740 align:middle line:84%
what they knew about
their particular race

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.043 align:middle line:84%
and what's planned
for the future,

00:35:54.043 --> 00:35:55.460 align:middle line:84%
can you imagine
what would happen?

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It'd be mind
blowing for everyone.

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:58.603 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: It would definitely be.

00:35:58.603 --> 00:36:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I'm thinking
Katie Schmidt in DC.

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:02.160 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm picturing.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being on the show.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: You're very welcome.

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:09.590 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
