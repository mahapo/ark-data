00:00:20.427 --> 00:00:22.260 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.610 align:middle line:10%
we're at an undisclosed
location with Tim.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.660 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.870 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.430 align:middle line:10%
in relation to extraterrestrial
groups and contact with Earth.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It's good to be here.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In a previous episode,
you mentioned the First Order.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.870 align:middle line:90%
Can you elaborate on that?

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Sure.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.540 align:middle line:10%
So the First Order
is the original name

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.360 align:middle line:10%
that the Greys gave themselves.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.910 align:middle line:84%
At least, it's the
best translation

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.460 align:middle line:84%
I could come up with
because it describes

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.030 align:middle line:84%
how they see themselves
as preserving

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:90%
the order of the universe.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's also describing
the mission they have,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.060 align:middle line:84%
which was pretty
important to find out

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:84%
about because what
they are doing

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.530 align:middle line:84%
is to collect certain
warrior type species

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.820 align:middle line:84%
and to bring them under one,
you know, hat, so to speak,

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.290 align:middle line:84%
in order to fix the
possible problems that

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.795 align:middle line:84%
can come up and occur
with warrior type species.

00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where did
that name come from?

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Naturally, it was
important to find out how they

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:42.110 align:middle line:84%
refer to themselves because, at
least in human understanding,

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:84%
the word, you know,
[NON-ENGLISH]..

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:84%
It means the word is how we
put ourselves out in the world.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And that was a challenge to find
out how they call themselves.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have a actual
translation to that,

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and even the translation
from the German word,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.580 align:middle line:84%
die erste Ordnung, which
means the First Order.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And it describes the
way they see themselves.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, that word's
still used today, correct?

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I suggest that this
word is still used today.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's a translation
that I came up

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.560 align:middle line:84%
with in behalf of what
they refer to themselves.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And the hieroglyphs they use
have a lot of content which

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.300 align:middle line:84%
might differ a little bit
to the world humans live in

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and the way humans culturally
think of the world.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's pretty important to
find out all about the details.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And order is
something that means

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:59.010 align:middle line:84%
to overcome a chaotic system
or chaotic status, which

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.970 align:middle line:90%
means to lower the entropy.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Entropy is something in
physics which describes

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.400 align:middle line:90%
the universe becoming chaotic.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that is
within the natural occurrence

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.750 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:84%
The first means that
they see themselves

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.420 align:middle line:84%
as the first manifestation
on that line.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:84%
They are the first ones to try
to preserve the natural order

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.980 align:middle line:90%
and harmony of the universe.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's in line
with their attention

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.390 align:middle line:84%
to keep the tonal
dynamics of everyone

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.735 align:middle line:90%
evolving in the universe.

00:03:40.735 --> 00:03:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You'd
mentioned one time

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.830 align:middle line:84%
that the Greys had an
administrative mission

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.570 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.330 align:middle line:84%
What could you
tell us about that?

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, the Greys are
working for different species

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.670 align:middle line:84%
while getting something
back in return.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So one thing
they're very good at

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.830 align:middle line:84%
is to find solutions
for problems,

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.720 align:middle line:84%
for example, because they are
a very intelligent and mental

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.860 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And what they do
is offer their help

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.850 align:middle line:84%
for planets and star systems
in order to manage things.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think that,
because the Greys have

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.800 align:middle line:84%
some kind of genetic
influence on humans

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:84%
and human people tend to
manage a lot of their stuff

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.450 align:middle line:84%
in the world, that this
can come from them.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.640 align:middle line:84%
This is just my theory because
I see some resemblance there.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
the Greys are doing.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.930 align:middle line:84%
They offer their
help to planets.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And the way they
help is in relation

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:03.130 align:middle line:84%
to what problems and what
challenges these systems have.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: This
hierarchical system

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.860 align:middle line:84%
seems very similar to what
we deal with here on Earth.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.030 align:middle line:90%
Did that come from the Greys?

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Interesting.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.600 align:middle line:84%
I think, personally, that there
is some kind of influence.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.870 align:middle line:84%
So human people have not
always been linked to elites.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.060 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, they were
more tribalistic and more open

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.850 align:middle line:90%
and had flatter hierarchies.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And the Grey system is
working as a pyramid scheme,

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.100 align:middle line:90%
from top down.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that
we find on this Earth,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:84%
as well as some
links to economics,

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.300 align:middle line:90%
as I already mentioned.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And I pretty much
think that this

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.620 align:middle line:84%
is something that
is, so to speak,

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.320 align:middle line:90%
in the genes of the humans.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think that
influence is from the Greys?

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And will that benefit us,
or will it benefit them?

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: To my analysis,
I think that cooperation

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and small hierarchies
is something

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.530 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
benefits more of.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:84%
It's better for everyone
in order to grow naturally

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and to treat everyone with
the same respect and worth,

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:31.240 align:middle line:84%
and to orient the mission
upon the individual skills

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.290 align:middle line:90%
that everyone has.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And there are species that
are very good at that.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.170 align:middle line:84%
They only analyze the
individual skills,

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.610 align:middle line:84%
and then put those
into place so that they

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.610 align:middle line:90%
can benefit from that.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.550 align:middle line:84%
But you can also see that
an authoritarian system

00:06:53.550 --> 00:07:00.000 align:middle line:84%
is something that accelerates
the speed a species can evolve.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there other
extraterrestrial races

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:84%
that are also trying
to influence humanity?

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.658 align:middle line:90%
And in what way?

00:07:08.658 --> 00:07:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: When you see that
there are groups on Earth that

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:15.120 align:middle line:84%
want to give direction to the
way the system is structured

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and the way the species
as a whole is evolving,

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.340 align:middle line:84%
and when you see that there are
outside forces that also want

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.210 align:middle line:84%
to put their
influence upon Earth,

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.530 align:middle line:84%
then everyone will
realize that this is not

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.610 align:middle line:90%
a productive system anymore.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not a cohesive
way in one direction.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways,
it blocks itself.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.880 align:middle line:84%
So what people are
dealing with right now

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.310 align:middle line:84%
is a so-called
lose-lose situation,

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:55.890 align:middle line:84%
which means that, by this ego,
struggling, dualistic thing

00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:00.300 align:middle line:84%
of pushing and pulling
the evolution of Earth

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.030 align:middle line:84%
in one direction and
another direction,

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:07.350 align:middle line:84%
it slows down the
evolution of humanity.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And as it's been said, there are
species that benefit from that.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, you mentioned
this warrior type of species.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.860 align:middle line:84%
How does that play
into the First Order?

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So there are warrior
type species in the universe

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.380 align:middle line:84%
and there are
non-warrior type species,

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:32.880 align:middle line:84%
which means peaceful and
harmonious species that

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.450 align:middle line:90%
do not develop a sense of war.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the majority
of species out there

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:48.800 align:middle line:84%
are peaceful and harmonious,
mostly because they

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.990 align:middle line:84%
don't see that the struggle
is worth the effort,

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.360 align:middle line:90%
and it's destructive.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Some are spiritually so evolved
that they know we're all one,

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and it's good to
maintain and to focus

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:09.800 align:middle line:84%
your energies on maintaining
a harmonious level of energy.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.380 align:middle line:84%
But there are also
some species--

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:16.970 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking about
this 95/5% ratio--

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:84%
where we have
warrior type species.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And in some way or another,
the warrior type species

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.230 align:middle line:84%
are important to the plan
and to the overall evolution

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:38.230 align:middle line:84%
of the universe because
harmonious species do not

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:41.800 align:middle line:90%
develop a defensive mechanism.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And they also haven't
got this force

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:50.800 align:middle line:84%
that is sometimes needed to
move into a certain direction.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.840 align:middle line:84%
As we've already said,
there's no good, no bad.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.090 align:middle line:90%
So they accept that.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:84%
They deal with it,
and they are helpful

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:02.260 align:middle line:84%
and try to make the garden
look as good as possible.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:90%
And that is great.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:04.870 align:middle line:90%
That is really great.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.410 align:middle line:84%
But what happens if there is
somebody entering the garden

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and picking up flowers
and destroying everything?

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Does that create a conflict
amongst these competing

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:17.740 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial beings?

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.160 align:middle line:90%
And in what way?

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It does because
what the Greys said

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:30.780 align:middle line:84%
and what they are convinced of
is that everyone has the choice

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:35.160 align:middle line:84%
to become part of this
warrior type species or not.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And there are clearly
individuals that

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.910 align:middle line:90%
want to make that experience.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.820 align:middle line:84%
It's the same emotional
factor to the brain that

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.010 align:middle line:90%
makes people play video games.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, that's
what the universe

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.850 align:middle line:90%
wants to experience sometimes.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Most of the species
agree upon one thing,

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:02.340 align:middle line:84%
that when that is played out,
at some point of the universe,

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.020 align:middle line:90%
people get bored from that.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.290 align:middle line:84%
You cannot play something all
the time and not get bored

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:09.090 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So there's
only one chance

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:20.010 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of this warrior
gene that is in some types.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.650 align:middle line:90%
And this is to let it happen.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Let it play out
until it gets boring.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the universe can go
on with its own evolution.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.060 align:middle line:84%
This or realizing that
self-destructive behavior

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.850 align:middle line:84%
is self-destructive, and
so it's not productive.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.510 align:middle line:84%
There is a concept
out there that,

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:45.660 align:middle line:84%
if you are an advanced
being, that you are not

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.880 align:middle line:90%
a warrior type being.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.363 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:11:49.363 --> 00:11:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: I've read that.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I've heard some people recently
talk about there cannot be

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:59.310 align:middle line:84%
a threat because some
beings are very advanced

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.970 align:middle line:90%
in their evolution.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.940 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Very less species tend
towards very self-destructive,

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.920 align:middle line:90%
aggressive behaviorism.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.970 align:middle line:84%
That means they
will come to a point

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:22.820 align:middle line:84%
where they either destroy
themselves or destroy

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:27.020 align:middle line:84%
the timeline they're
on and need to go back.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:32.250 align:middle line:84%
But we're still at the phase
where things figure themselves

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.050 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you trust
the warrior type species?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Not all of them.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.210 align:middle line:84%
You see, trust is
defined as something

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.140 align:middle line:90%
that needs experiences.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And we see that
some warrior type

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:84%
species can go into a very
harmful and wrongful direction.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:13:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And this happens a
lot if you do not

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:06.920 align:middle line:84%
commit yourself to be like a
light warrior or something.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.760 align:middle line:84%
If you're not having an
ethical and moral center,

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.540 align:middle line:84%
then things tend to go
in the wrong direction.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they stepping
on each other's toes

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.670 align:middle line:90%
when this happens?

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It does.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I see and I understand the
point that the universe offers

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:29.130 align:middle line:84%
this experience to
some individuals that

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:34.800 align:middle line:84%
want to experience that, and it
somehow needs to be played out.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:40.290 align:middle line:84%
But then again, the
commitment to order

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:45.870 align:middle line:84%
is something that needs to come
from an ethical, moral centered

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.570 align:middle line:84%
standpoint and
from the intellect,

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:54.840 align:middle line:84%
whereas being grateful and
harmonious and open and loving

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.810 align:middle line:84%
is something that
comes from your heart.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's different from
dimension to dimension,

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.048 align:middle line:90%
too, isn't it?

00:14:03.048 --> 00:14:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: It's not so much about--

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because
in the 3D, when you

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:11.690 align:middle line:84%
say, as you explained earlier,
that when we have conflicts,

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.330 align:middle line:90%
we just go to war.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And then being a higher advanced
being, and a light being,

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.770 align:middle line:90%
it's not the same.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So this is a phenomenon
that occurs especially

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle line:84%
in level three and level
four consciousness,

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:33.350 align:middle line:84%
which both deal with the
dualistic perspective

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.810 align:middle line:84%
on the world, which means
there's an I, there's an I.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And if we compete about
something, then, well,

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:45.140 align:middle line:84%
striving for it, fighting
for it, arguing about it

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:49.430 align:middle line:84%
is something that occurs
very, very, very often.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: People have this
vision and this thought process

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:58.340 align:middle line:84%
that, if you're an advanced
being, why would you go to war

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.390 align:middle line:84%
or have any conflicts
with Earth or anyone?

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I've recently
read about people

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.890 align:middle line:84%
arguing that when there are so
many advanced beings out there,

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:14.000 align:middle line:84%
why should they
behave badly or get

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.580 align:middle line:90%
in conflict with each other.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And there is some truth
to that because, see,

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:26.090 align:middle line:84%
the more spiritually
advanced a species become,

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:84%
it will tend to see
everything as one,

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:34.890 align:middle line:84%
and tend towards a
harmonious lifestyle.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:41.070 align:middle line:84%
But especially as long
as there are problems

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:46.430 align:middle line:84%
that are still
unsolved, there needs

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:50.470 align:middle line:90%
to be some counterpart to that.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.580 align:middle line:84%
So peace is just
as good, as long

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.830 align:middle line:84%
as somebody
preserves that peace.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.560 align:middle line:84%
If you have this beautiful
garden and everybody

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.250 align:middle line:84%
is stepping over
your roses, then you

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:04.680 align:middle line:90%
don't have joy for long.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And that is why there
are some warrior type

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.060 align:middle line:90%
species that preserve that.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.630 align:middle line:84%
If you're thinking
about all these stories

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:20.280 align:middle line:84%
about light warriors,
they do have a mission.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:84%
They are necessary as long as
the universe and this realm

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:29.100 align:middle line:84%
of reality deals with
dualistic processes

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.520 align:middle line:90%
and still has different agendas.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's true that the higher
the frequency of a being, when

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.120 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
inter-frequential beings,

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.850 align:middle line:84%
they tend to be very
harmonious and peaceful.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:46.010 align:middle line:90%
They developed across that.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But what
about a developed,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:90%
advanced warrior species?

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Good question.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Advanced warrior
type species will

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.830 align:middle line:84%
deal with the
problem of stability,

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:01.600 align:middle line:84%
which means you need to
have a stable system.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.369 align:middle line:84%
You cannot go and have
self-destructive behavior

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:14.530 align:middle line:84%
unless the species will be
oriented towards a failed

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:15.970 align:middle line:90%
timeline.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So advanced warrior
type species need

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:27.460 align:middle line:84%
to intellectualize the necessity
for an ethical and moral

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.180 align:middle line:90%
standpoint.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do they have their
own protocol for that,

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.640 align:middle line:84%
if they are going to
engage, that no one

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.960 align:middle line:90%
else gets attacked or hurt?

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.320 align:middle line:84%
In this phase of
the universe, there

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.630 align:middle line:90%
are lots and lots of agendas.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Every individual, every
group, every species,

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.220 align:middle line:84%
every collective,
every star system,

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:90%
they all have their own agendas.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.050 align:middle line:84%
It's like the universe
tries to figure out

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:56.400 align:middle line:84%
what's the correct way
where to go, you know?

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the so-called
First Order comes into play

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.920 align:middle line:84%
because they have
this mission and idea

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.220 align:middle line:84%
to unify all warrior
type species,

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:13.380 align:middle line:84%
to find a common sense
and mutual way of behaving

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.040 align:middle line:84%
and then put some
roots to it in order

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:22.590 align:middle line:84%
to have a beneficial and
productive way of playing

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:84%
this warrior type
experience out.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Does the
order have many species

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.480 align:middle line:90%
involved with this?

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So the First Order is after
every potential warrior

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.520 align:middle line:84%
type being in the
universe because that's

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.520 align:middle line:90%
when they succeed.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: You see there
are, unfortunately,

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:53.810 align:middle line:84%
still forces that have developed
self-destructive and bad

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:54.740 align:middle line:90%
habits.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's very easy for
them to stick to that.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And somebody needs
to polarize that

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.770 align:middle line:90%
or to bring that into balance.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because it's just
business as usual for them.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Well, correct.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.890 align:middle line:84%
If they want to preserve
their own status

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and not get
destabilized, they need

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.720 align:middle line:84%
to force their will
upon others, which

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.500 align:middle line:84%
will end in
destructive behavior,

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.950 align:middle line:84%
and is destructive behavior,
but it will take some time.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is
they try to play time

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:84%
to preserve their negative and
self-destructive behavior as

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.500 align:middle line:84%
long as they can in
order to not change.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.300 align:middle line:90%
This is something--

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sounds familiar.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.010 align:middle line:90%
Sounds like Earth, in a way.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: True.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every individual
can relate to that

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:57.270 align:middle line:84%
when somebody has, I don't
know, eaten the wrong things

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:84%
and they see that it's
not good for the body.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:04.130 align:middle line:84%
You can observe that
humans go on with it

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.430 align:middle line:90%
until there's a catalyst.

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And then,
it's so dramatic

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.080 align:middle line:90%
that they need to change.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.270 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, we are
intelligent energy

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.690 align:middle line:84%
and we can be responsible
for our choices.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:84%
So that is when we choose
for the right side.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there a police
force inside the order?

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So what we know is that
the Greys have this mission

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.840 align:middle line:84%
to administer the whole
structure of the auras.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Their mission to bring
everyone together

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and to structure
all the species that

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.040 align:middle line:90%
fall within the First Order.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:44.330 align:middle line:84%
There's naturally nothing
above this First Order,

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:51.930 align:middle line:84%
so nobody is controlling
the First Order

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.460 align:middle line:90%
than the First Order.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.170 align:middle line:84%
That's why they call
them First Order.

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.580 align:middle line:84%
But if you're talking about the
police execution force inside

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:01.620 align:middle line:84%
of the First Order--
and we have many,

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:05.660 align:middle line:84%
many species and warrior type
species that are combined under

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.710 align:middle line:84%
this consortium
or this alliance--

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:14.910 align:middle line:84%
then yes, everyone
that takes the favor

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.610 align:middle line:84%
of the Greys and
the technologies

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:84%
and get into contract with what
the Greys offer and the First

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Order offers commits
to a certain set

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.240 align:middle line:90%
of rules and regulations.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So everyone can basically have
their own way of doing things,

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.510 align:middle line:84%
as long as those regulations
are carried out and respected,

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:44.380 align:middle line:84%
which means the free will
needs to be preserved,

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.790 align:middle line:84%
the tonal dynamics, which means
the way an individual wants

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.460 align:middle line:84%
to behave, needs
to be preserved.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And these are basically
the rules and regulations

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.550 align:middle line:84%
that come with being
member of this First Order.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk about
the law of the First Order

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.600 align:middle line:84%
versus the cosmic law
in another episode.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is the rules and
regulations ever broken?

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.360 align:middle line:90%
You know, what happens?

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: For sure.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:21.990 align:middle line:84%
So there are many cases
where warrior type species

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:27.330 align:middle line:84%
become part of the First
Order and then just take

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.720 align:middle line:84%
away the benefits
and do not want

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.720 align:middle line:84%
to commit to the overall
mission and plan.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is what happens
when warrior type

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:42.660 align:middle line:90%
beings get into conflict.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:47.900 align:middle line:90%
And then, yeah.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you see that
happening here on Earth?

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: I actually do.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:57.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that the Earth, as
a warrior type species that

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.020 align:middle line:84%
has certain contracts
with the Greys,

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:06.270 align:middle line:84%
is obliged to fulfill certain
rules and regulations.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And the time is
running, and things

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.170 align:middle line:84%
need to be administered
in certain ways

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:84%
in order to have a mutual
benefit for everyone.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where do you see
humanity as we move forward

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:25.740 align:middle line:90%
in relation to the First Order?

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: I can only assume.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:33.760 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I think that
the harmful installation that

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.370 align:middle line:84%
has terrorized
Earth for thousands

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:42.990 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of years is going
to be removed in order to come

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:47.760 align:middle line:84%
back to a place where
everyone can evolve constantly

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.700 align:middle line:84%
and successfully
because everyone

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:54.570 align:middle line:84%
has made the experience,
I guess, on this planet

00:23:54.570 --> 00:24:02.500 align:middle line:84%
that developing spiritually and
constantly in a positive way

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.320 align:middle line:84%
is something that is
made really, really hard.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk about
that in another episode.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:13.790 align:middle line:84%
But reality is
shifting more and more.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.200 align:middle line:84%
More and more people
will come forward

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.720 align:middle line:84%
and tell about
their relationships

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.790 align:middle line:90%
to extraterrestrials.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:23.250 align:middle line:84%
We will also see
extraterrestrials

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:84%
on this planet as we
proceed in this progress.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:34.140 align:middle line:84%
So seeing all this and
having opportunities

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:38.430 align:middle line:84%
to evolve in different
ways and individually

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:43.710 align:middle line:84%
is something that is
coming up quite quickly.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's really
an individual process.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So every one of us is
responsible for writing

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:53.360 align:middle line:84%
the right timeline and
giving the right energy

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.020 align:middle line:90%
into the system.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And when we have that, we
will also shift the planet

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and have a different
reality here.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, thank you so
much for being on the show.

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:04.423 align:middle line:90%
It's always a pleasure.

00:25:04.423 --> 00:25:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Thank you
very much, Emery.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.440 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.950 align:middle line:90%


00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, what or who
maintains and oversees

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.490 align:middle line:90%
these laws?

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Cosmic law
is a natural force,

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:26.320 align:middle line:84%
and describes the natural
dynamics of the universe.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.430 align:middle line:84%
All other laws we're talking
about are artificial laws.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.040 align:middle line:10%
When we're talking about
the law of the First Order,

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.230 align:middle line:10%
this is something
that does not apply

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:39.040 align:middle line:10%
to every part of the
universe, although this

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.080 align:middle line:10%
is the mission of the
Greys, to establish that.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:47.560 align:middle line:84%
But it only applies to those who
are in contract with the Greys.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:51.210 align:middle line:90%
