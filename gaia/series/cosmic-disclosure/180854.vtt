00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, George Noory,
and I'm here with Emery Smith,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle line:90%
ET Crash retrievals.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've all heard about
Roswell and many other UFO

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.080 align:middle line:90%
crashes.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.539 align:middle line:84%
Emery, welcome back
to the program.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.413 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY SMITH: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:33.413 --> 00:00:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Have you been on
crash retrieval programs?

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.839 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Where?

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.380 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: Well, I was stationed
in New Mexico at Kirtland Air

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.870 align:middle line:10%
Force Base.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.650 align:middle line:10%
And that's where one of
their main facilities

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.800 align:middle line:10%
are, that they have these
groups of individuals,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.870 align:middle line:10%
from all around the
US, that'll fly in,

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.240 align:middle line:10%
depending on their specialty.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.970 align:middle line:84%
I was part of a
three-man team that

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.660 align:middle line:84%
would be going there to
evaluate the site, kind

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.890 align:middle line:84%
of like forensics, like
when there's a death,

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.050 align:middle line:90%
and they wall it all off.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:84%
So the military
gets there first.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.540 align:middle line:84%
They wall off everything,
secure the area,

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and then we get sent in
before anyone else goes

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.580 align:middle line:84%
there to basically look at all
that material and the craft.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.170 align:middle line:84%
If there's any bodies, what's
safe to touch, what's not.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.800 align:middle line:84%
There's many different
devices that are put in place.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.200 align:middle line:84%
We're many hundreds
of yards behind,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.260 align:middle line:84%
setting up base camps to analyze
the crash site, make sure it's

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:90%
even safe to approach first.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Using all sorts of
different special cameras

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:84%
and whatnot to scan the areas
with satellites, to make sure

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.150 align:middle line:84%
there's no extraterrestrial
biological entity still alive,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and if they are still
alive, to go in there

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.380 align:middle line:90%
and treat them first.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And since we were already
examining many, many bodies,

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I was part of that project to
distinguish what type of ET

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:84%
this was, and was
it safe to approach.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And also along with the
craft and the material

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.014 align:middle line:84%
that were around there,
such as the devices,

00:02:07.014 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:84%
since a lot of them are
consciousness-assisted

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.830 align:middle line:84%
technologies that are
linked biologically

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:90%
to the extraterrestrials.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.710 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
shut a craft off

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.897 align:middle line:84%
that might be keeping the body
alive of the extraterrestrial.

00:02:23.897 --> 00:02:24.980 align:middle line:90%
So there's a lot of these.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.730 align:middle line:84%
It's basically a
triage of the area.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:90%
Is it a safe to go?

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.780 align:middle line:84%
If it is, then
other teams come in.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:90%
We're collecting debris.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.930 align:middle line:90%
We're collecting devices.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.570 align:middle line:84%
We're collecting
bodies and so forth.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why do
they crash so often?

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.090 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: Well, once any
extraterrestrial manifests

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.450 align:middle line:10%
itself in 3D, even if
they're interdimensional,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.530 align:middle line:10%
they still fall under the laws
of our three-dimensional space.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.890 align:middle line:90%
So they're not bulletproof.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.690 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.380 align:middle line:84%
They might be able to outrun
us, form a gravity flux field

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.290 align:middle line:84%
around their craft,
and things happen.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.450 align:middle line:84%
They're not perfect
either, and things

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.270 align:middle line:84%
can happen with their
craft malfunctioning.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.695 align:middle line:84%
Most likely, we shot
them down, to be honest.

00:03:07.695 --> 00:03:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, really?

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, using scalar
infratometry and energetic beam

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.250 align:middle line:90%
weapons.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.790 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of this going
on, because the governments

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and corporations don't
want anyone to know

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:90%
that these things exist.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.676 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do
prove they exist,

00:03:23.676 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
then you prove that they didn't
get here by gas, coal, and oil.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:84%
They got here by zero-point
energy, free energy.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And we
want that energy.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: They're going
to lose all their money,

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.670 align:middle line:84%
because we won't have to
pay our electric bills.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What is scalar energy?

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, scalar
infratometry has been used

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.030 align:middle line:84%
I usually don't tell people to
read books or promote anyone,

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.842 align:middle line:84%
but Tom Bearden has
a really good book

00:03:45.842 --> 00:03:48.050 align:middle line:84%
on scalar and photometry,
if you guys could look that

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:90%
up and get educated on it.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's a special
type of frequency

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.930 align:middle line:84%
that travels within
time and space.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.970 align:middle line:84%
So if there's a
device, let's say,

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.730 align:middle line:84%
in China, they could easily
shoot it through the earth

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.380 align:middle line:90%
and vaporize just you.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.140 align:middle line:84%
They can make a huge earthquake
off the coast there in Asia

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and create a tsunami, or
they could make a hurricane

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.660 align:middle line:90%
and have it take out Biloxi.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.460 align:middle line:84%
So these weapons
are very dangerous.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.279 align:middle line:84%
There's only six of
them that I'm aware of,

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:20.510 align:middle line:84%
that's documented, and they
have been used all the time.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you see a really
cataclysmic event,

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.470 align:middle line:84%
it's usually done by someone
intentionally to demonstrate

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.310 align:middle line:84%
to another country, Hey, if
you don't give us what we want,

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.820 align:middle line:84%
we'll wipe you out,
like we did Sumatra.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.610 align:middle line:84%
This was just a test to show
you what we're capable of.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.070 align:middle line:90%
So the Japanese Yakuza has one.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Of course the United
States has one.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:90%
I do believe Brazil.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Where did we
get this technology?

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: We developed it,
and it's also other reverse

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.450 align:middle line:90%
engineered stuff that we found.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
downside of any type

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.640 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial technology
falling the wrong hands,

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.330 align:middle line:84%
but don't forget, it
also can be used to heal.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.230 align:middle line:84%
It also can be used to clean
up Fukushima in 20 seconds.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So why are we not using
this for the betterment

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.920 align:middle line:90%
of the planet is the question.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you're on a crash
retrieval, what do you see?

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, I'll
give you one example.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:84%
I came across a craft that
look like giant LEGOs.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:25.470 align:middle line:84%
It was probably about 50 feet by
about maybe 30, 40 feet width,

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and it was crumbling,
and it looked

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.080 align:middle line:84%
like it was made out of a
meteorite, but very metallic

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.220 align:middle line:90%
metal-like.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.770 align:middle line:84%
It was actually in the
ground a little bit.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.710 align:middle line:90%
It dug up some soil.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And we had approached
this craft,

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and it's already been scanned
by the satellites for radiation

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.050 align:middle line:90%
and other things.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.770 align:middle line:84%
We were the first
individuals to walk up on it.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen a craft
like this in the projects,

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.210 align:middle line:90%
so it was kind of new for me.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And it had broken qubits
of it all over the place

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.690 align:middle line:84%
that were glowing
an orange glow,

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.677 align:middle line:84%
but was not emitting
heat or anything.

00:06:02.677 --> 00:06:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: No smoke,
nothing like that?

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: No, there
was no smoke, no dust.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.950 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
debris behind it

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.260 align:middle line:84%
a few hundred yards
that was made up

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.270 align:middle line:84%
of all sorts of extraterrestrial
devices and things

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.250 align:middle line:84%
like that that must
have fallen out.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:84%
There were three
extraterrestrial beings

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.850 align:middle line:84%
that were there, two were dead
and one was on its way out.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And they were a type of
human, more bluish in color

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.680 align:middle line:84%
and very tall, about
six or seven feet.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be very
careful, because the craft,

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:84%
you could still feel like
a hum from the craft,

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's like the
craft is still--

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Active.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Active, operational.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.930 align:middle line:84%
We have to be careful that
we don't touch something,

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.130 align:middle line:90%
and it explode at the same time.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.330 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these times that we
walk up on these situations,

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.370 align:middle line:84%
the craft is actually trying
to keep the body alive.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:84%
We have experts there
also that, if we

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.890 align:middle line:84%
don't know what
type of ET it is,

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.220 align:middle line:84%
they try to do some
things with it.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.520 align:middle line:84%
One time, they brought an
extraterrestrial with us

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:84%
that did know the
race, and they were

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.520 align:middle line:84%
trying to resuscitate
this extraterrestrial.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing it
through the wrong orifice,

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and there was another orifice
around the sternal notch it

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.960 align:middle line:84%
had actually breathed
through, and they

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.191 align:middle line:90%
were able to resuscitate him.

00:07:29.191 --> 00:07:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we're called there
because we know the best

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.210 align:middle line:90%
anatomy of these beings.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.274 align:middle line:84%
We understand how
everything works.

00:07:35.274 --> 00:07:37.440 align:middle line:84%
We're familiar also with a
lot of the equipment that

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.990 align:middle line:84%
comes with the beings and,
of course, their craft.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:44.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's a big laying out and
triaging everything and making

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.120 align:middle line:84%
sure that this is safe
to touch this isn't.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.405 align:middle line:84%
Let's air-evac this
being out immediately.

00:07:51.405 --> 00:07:54.530 align:middle line:90%
Let's tried to save this being.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, we
have special devices,

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.590 align:middle line:84%
and we can tell if moving
the being away from the craft

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.177 align:middle line:90%
could be deadly for that being.

00:08:04.177 --> 00:08:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you have an
ambulance nearby and stuff like

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.210 align:middle line:90%
that?

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:08.918 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, it
depends where it's at.

00:08:08.918 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:84%
If it's near highways or if it's
out in the middle of nowhere,

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:84%
they use giant VTOLs
and helicopters

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of these other
things, but there's always

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:21.540 align:middle line:90%
some sort of ground team.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.500 align:middle line:84%
The state fire department,
forestry division,

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and police departments all
have their own protocol

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:34.479 align:middle line:84%
for downed aerial UFO craft,
of course, to secure the area.

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:35.520 align:middle line:90%
No one can know anything.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Don't let any media in until
the military gets there,

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.970 align:middle line:84%
and the military's
pretty quick, within 30

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.550 align:middle line:84%
minutes of a downed craft pretty
much anywhere in the planet,

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.720 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be secured that
quickly with a group of very

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.292 align:middle line:84%
specially-trained special forces
guys that don't have anything

00:08:53.292 --> 00:08:54.750 align:middle line:84%
to do with the
craft, but they know

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:84%
that's the area
they have to protect

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.240 align:middle line:84%
before more backup comes, and
they get deployed very quickly.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: In your circles, have
they talked about the Roswell

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:06.510 align:middle line:90%
case?

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Never.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.400 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like--

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.890 align:middle line:84%
it's just everyone knows it
happened, and it's just sad.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.890 align:middle line:84%
They don't know about the
other one that crashed

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.222 align:middle line:90%
in Socorro at the same time.

00:09:14.222 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And Cape Girardeau.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Cape Girardeau, right.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.115 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:17.115 --> 00:09:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of these
happening, and it's just sad.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.260 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like,
it's been beaten up

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.327 align:middle line:84%
so much that it's hard for
some people to believe,

00:09:25.327 --> 00:09:26.910 align:middle line:84%
some people not to
believe because all

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:90%
this disinformation.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not really
talked about in the projects

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.910 align:middle line:84%
compared to the new stuff
that happens everyday

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:37.230 align:middle line:90%
that's 10 times more exciting.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Even though it is covered up,
it is being recorded somewhere.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.950 align:middle line:90%
It is going on a database.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.720 align:middle line:84%
I do believe one
of our G8 countries

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.310 align:middle line:84%
that's really good
at hacking things

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:54.337 align:middle line:84%
will soon hack into these
things and expose these events.

00:09:54.337 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What about each
ancient retrievals that go way

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.370 align:middle line:84%
back even to the biblical
times of antiquity.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.270 align:middle line:90%
Anything there?

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Sure.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.470 align:middle line:84%
There's craft being found
with ground penetrating radar

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:84%
all the time, deep
within the Earth's crust,

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:13.080 align:middle line:84%
and basically, what they do for
these types of situations is

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.790 align:middle line:84%
they'll scan it with
some special technology.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: OK.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And they'll take
it back to the surface,

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:25.370 align:middle line:84%
this information, and they'll
3D print the entire ship,

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:84%
even if it's hundreds of
feet or large as the Titanic,

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.935 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:10:29.935 --> 00:10:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And they'll recreate in 3D
print, this whole thing,

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:90%
and set it up.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And use that for
a couple of years,

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.650 align:middle line:84%
practicing when we breach it
and go in and go here and there.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.854 align:middle line:84%
And what's this, and what's
that, and depending on

00:10:40.854 --> 00:10:42.770 align:middle line:84%
is it giving off some
sort of energy signature

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.400 align:middle line:90%
we have to be careful of?

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot that
goes into it, before they

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.890 align:middle line:84%
start drilling in the ground and
going down into these things.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Because some of these
craft, sometimes, we

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.130 align:middle line:84%
don't understand how
it got in granite.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:90%
How did it get in?

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Did it just teletransport to the
wrong area, and it got stuck?

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:00.440 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So these things they
take very seriously,

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and it might take years and
years before they actually

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.720 align:middle line:84%
get into it, and this is also
happening down in Antarctica

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.740 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.660 align:middle line:90%
They've found many craft.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.274 align:middle line:90%
They found a big civilization.

00:11:17.274 --> 00:11:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Underwater cities?

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Underwater city.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:84%
That being said, they
have to be careful,

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:28.090 align:middle line:84%
because depending also where
it's at, how many organizations

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:31.150 align:middle line:84%
are involved, how many
governments are involved,

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.670 align:middle line:84%
what's the chances of
something leaking out.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:37.270 align:middle line:84%
They're really strict on, right
now, like who goes down there.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.910 align:middle line:84%
It's also they're putting
in a disinformation campaign

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%
already down there of getting
artifacts from the Mayans

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and from Egypt,
and discombobulate

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:49.870 align:middle line:84%
the archeologists that do go
there later on and throw them

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.277 align:middle line:90%
off a little bit.

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Were you set
on retrievals, Emery,

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.720 align:middle line:84%
because of your
medical background?

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I was I was sent on
retrievals only because I had

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:02.710 align:middle line:84%
experience on classifying
extraterrestrials,

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.980 align:middle line:84%
classifying devices
from extraterrestrials,

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.970 align:middle line:84%
and working on the
extraterrestrial crafts.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.367 align:middle line:84%
So I was there more to say, this
is what I know about this body.

00:12:13.367 --> 00:12:14.950 align:middle line:84%
This is what I know
about this device.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.900 align:middle line:90%
This I know about this craft.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Some extraterrestrials, you
can't just go up and touch.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You could
contaminate yourself.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.110 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
touching an electric eel,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.570 align:middle line:90%
so you got to be really careful.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And the science behind
all that, with the craft

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.930 align:middle line:84%
communicating with the
devices, communicating

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.930 align:middle line:84%
with cybernetic
organisms that are there,

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.150 align:middle line:84%
trying to help heal
the craft, they

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.730 align:middle line:84%
have their own thing going on
that we are still learning.

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.529 align:middle line:84%
Like when our plane
crashes, we go out.

00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:43.570 align:middle line:90%
We have our own protocol.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, they have a
protocol too, and also

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.460 align:middle line:90%
is it transmitting anything?

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Are they sending for help?

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to
dematerialize right now?

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of being
in a triage field,

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:01.572 align:middle line:84%
and you're walking in on
a very chaotic situation.

00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:04.030 align:middle line:84%
It's sad too, because you don't
know what exactly happened,

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.290 align:middle line:90%
especially when there's bodies.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.748 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, I
was going to say,

00:13:06.748 --> 00:13:10.130 align:middle line:84%
have you come up cross ETs that
we're still alive but injured?

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, many times the
extraterrestrials are alive,

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes they are
communicating telepathically.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they're speaking in
languages we don't understand.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And just like you would
try to help someone

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.405 align:middle line:84%
from a foreign country
that just got hit by a car,

00:13:27.405 --> 00:13:29.280 align:middle line:84%
and you don't understand
what they're saying,

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:33.410 align:middle line:84%
you know they're in pain,
and you're trying to help.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.860 align:middle line:84%
It's a very difficult
situation to be

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.820 align:middle line:84%
in when there's a communication
problem, because not

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.020 align:middle line:84%
all of them communicate
through telepathic means

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.910 align:middle line:90%
or speak English, of course.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:49.270 align:middle line:84%
So you have to treat
it very sensitive,

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time,
we're really there.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:52.720 align:middle line:84%
We really want to
help this being.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.640 align:middle line:84%
We want to save this being
and get it back on its feet,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:84%
but maybe picking it
up will kill it too.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.400 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe separating it from
the craft will kill it,

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.370 align:middle line:84%
and when we know there's these
energy signatures happening,

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.590 align:middle line:90%
sometimes--

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:12.370 align:middle line:84%
they're already preparing to
move the craft, no matter what.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, we'll put the
being back into the craft.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.770 align:middle line:84%
We notice that helps
a lot, by putting

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:21.230 align:middle line:84%
the being back in the
craft and transporting

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:84%
the beings and the craft
all together at once.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.480 align:middle line:84%
There's many
documented cases where

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.260 align:middle line:84%
the craft is trying to heal
itself, is trying to form

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.960 align:middle line:90%
another shell over the shell.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these craft are
formed by sound in space,

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.867 align:middle line:84%
and they're infused with
consciousness from the person,

00:14:42.867 --> 00:14:44.950 align:middle line:84%
so it's kind of like part
of the person, actually.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's alive.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right, it's alive.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.170 align:middle line:90%
The craft is alive.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's amazing.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: It is.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's a
biological craft.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It's a biological
craft, absolutely.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.944 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The LEGO- looking
craft, was that biological?

00:14:55.944 --> 00:14:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, it was.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: In your
opinion, it was.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Absolutely.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tell me
about contamination

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and the possibilities that the
planet could get contaminated.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: The craft are
immediately put in these giant,

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:12.550 align:middle line:84%
bubble-like tents,
and what happens is,

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:19.812 align:middle line:84%
if there is any sort of like
really bad contamination--

00:15:19.812 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How would you know?

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: It could spread.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.807 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have these devices that
scan the area with frequencies.

00:15:25.807 --> 00:15:27.140 align:middle line:90%
Remember, I told you about this.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: That has a database of
bacteria and viruses and things

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:36.220 align:middle line:84%
like this that we have to
protect the planet, regardless,

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and there have been times where
they will sterilize an area.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And they will completely
vaporize that whole craft,

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:50.200 align:middle line:84%
just because there might
have been a chemical

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.940 align:middle line:90%
or a biological agent.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.660 align:middle line:84%
That's when they use special
energy weapons and other things

00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:00.190 align:middle line:84%
to vaporize that entire
area without causing damage

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.470 align:middle line:90%
to the surrounding--

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.020 align:middle line:84%
minimal damage to
the environment.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.105 align:middle line:84%
It's like a no-fly zone
here, because we're

00:16:07.105 --> 00:16:09.490 align:middle line:90%
a really evil species.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Like anything that
comes near our space,

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:13.750 align:middle line:90%
we want to shoot it down.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So the craft have
not been coming

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:19.030 align:middle line:84%
so much as they used to in
the '50s and '60s, of course,

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:90%
and '40s.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Because we have now these
neutrino light detectors

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.670 align:middle line:84%
on the satellites that pick
up on different wavelengths

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.220 align:middle line:84%
of energy, that we can
pinpoint where they're at

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.985 align:middle line:84%
and shoot them down or vaporize
them before they get there.

00:16:31.985 --> 00:16:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
other extraterrestrials

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.020 align:middle line:84%
which are highly
advanced that can just

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:84%
be right outside the door now--
you wouldn't even know it--

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.940 align:middle line:84%
in their mothership,
because it's cloaked

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.320 align:middle line:90%
and not giving off any energy.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So there's many different
levels of this technology.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's truly remarkable
how we're able to retrieve

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.464 align:middle line:90%
these craft.

00:16:51.464 --> 00:16:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And how many are
we talking about?

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Since you know, how many,
two, three, a hundred?

00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Hundreds.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Hundreds of crashes?

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah, hundreds.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And how
many do we knock down?

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.349 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: I don't know.

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:08.119 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why would
we be so hostile?

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:11.329 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: We can't allow the
American people to know that

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:16.920 align:middle line:84%
they exist, because if they do,
then it's going to destroy gas,

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.290 align:middle line:90%
coal, and oil and big pharma.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So when you get onto
the scene, and they're alive,

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:22.400 align:middle line:90%
what do you do?

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, I first
try to figure out if--

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.144 align:middle line:84%
it's a joint thing, me
and two other people

00:17:28.144 --> 00:17:31.100 align:middle line:84%
are usually the first
ones there that walk up

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.710 align:middle line:84%
after it's been scanned,
after we saw all the data.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And if there are
alive ones there,

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:41.140 align:middle line:84%
we will approach the beings,
if it's safe for us to,

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.970 align:middle line:90%
and try to communicate first.

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And after communication
is done, we

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:50.390 align:middle line:84%
see if we can offer
assistance in any way.

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:54.770 align:middle line:84%
We ask questions, if the
being is able to communicate.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:18:00.220 align:middle line:84%
First of all, where are you
from, how did you get here,

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and how can we help
the rest of your crew?

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.110 align:middle line:84%
We ask really basic
questions that you

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:09.350 align:middle line:84%
would see kind of in pop
culture, like you would

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.780 align:middle line:84%
with someone that got
in a car accident.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you
comfort them, the ET?

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Of course, they
know we're there being

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.090 align:middle line:90%
compassionate.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:21.110 align:middle line:84%
They're not drawing weapons
or anything like that.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.160 align:middle line:90%
This is a crash.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.577 align:middle line:84%
We're not told, this thing
crashed or shot down.

00:18:24.577 --> 00:18:25.910 align:middle line:90%
We don't know when we get there.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.310 align:middle line:84%
We're there to
establish contact,

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:33.290 align:middle line:84%
to triage the extraterrestrials,
and then triage the craft.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Triage all the devices
that are there,

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.930 align:middle line:84%
because some of the devices
are also alive as well.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of things
going on at one point.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Before the team
comes in, we have

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:47.360 align:middle line:84%
to declare this area safe
for everyone to come and do

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.710 align:middle line:90%
what they need to do.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And safe just means you're just
not going to walk up and die.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: From the
electromagnetic fields that

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:84%
still might be on or
the extraterrestrials

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:04.850 align:middle line:84%
if they're known to carry
different biological strains

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:05.660 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.530 align:middle line:84%
We've had many bodies
that we worked on--

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:13.340 align:middle line:84%
and just like we have
like bacteria on our body

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.862 align:middle line:90%
that's not friendly.

00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:84%
We have staph growing all
over our body all the time,

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:20.510 align:middle line:84%
but our immune systems are
so good, we fight it off.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.630 align:middle line:84%
So they also sometimes
have bacteria

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:25.710 align:middle line:90%
and viruses and things.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be
careful of that,

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.460 align:middle line:84%
and even though they
might be a healthy ET,

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.680 align:middle line:84%
it's just like a
contamination issue.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a biohazard,
no matter what.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:40.070 align:middle line:10%
So we have to take these
beings and escort them

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.370 align:middle line:10%
to special aircraft
that are fitted out

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:45.770 align:middle line:10%
with these airtight
hyperbaric oxygen

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:50.630 align:middle line:10%
chambers inside the craft,
and load them in there.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes scientists go
in to continue communication

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:56.220 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And then from there,
usually the craft

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:03.940 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, immediately
moved as quickly as possible,

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:90%
if they can.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:05.666 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: If they can.

00:20:05.666 --> 00:20:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: If they can, if
not, they'll stage a big thing

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.180 align:middle line:84%
to get people out there, like
they did in "Close Encounters

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.720 align:middle line:84%
of the Third Kind," saying
there's some outbreak

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.360 align:middle line:90%
or chemical spill or whatever.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.175 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: To panic us.

00:20:20.175 --> 00:20:21.520 align:middle line:90%
Do they have blood?

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.403 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What type blood?

00:20:23.403 --> 00:20:24.700 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever tested it?

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:25.500 align:middle line:90%
O positive?

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:84%
No, it's similar to that
but not like that at all.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.070 align:middle line:90%
We're very similar.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.370 align:middle line:84%
They have cells that are
used for energy transport,

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:40.170 align:middle line:84%
for whatever that is, if it's
oxygen and mineral transport,

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and they have also
their own immune system.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.600 align:middle line:84%
We classify that
very differently

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.990 align:middle line:84%
than we do our own
blood, of course,

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:51.140 align:middle line:84%
but it's similar is
what I'm getting at.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:56.040 align:middle line:84%
They do have the similar
cell-type working

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.920 align:middle line:84%
cells that do specific
things in their body.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they
have other cells

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.090 align:middle line:84%
that we're not familiar
with, that have

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:07.650 align:middle line:84%
to do with other things,
such as creating energy

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:11.054 align:middle line:84%
from within the
cell to heal itself.

00:21:11.054 --> 00:21:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So some of these ETs
you mentioned that we shoot

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:84%
down, when you approach them,
how did they react to you?

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: First of all, they're
worth more to us alive than

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:23.760 align:middle line:90%
they are dead for the projects.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And just like in modern-day war,
when we shoot down our enemy,

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and we go pick them up
after they parachuted down,

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:34.730 align:middle line:90%
we still--

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:36.230 align:middle line:84%
if they have any
injuries-- we still

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.340 align:middle line:84%
help them get back
on their feet.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.200 align:middle line:84%
They sometimes
don't have a choice,

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.610 align:middle line:84%
because if they
did have a choice,

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.180 align:middle line:90%
I think they would not be there.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.860 align:middle line:90%
They would have left somehow.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.160 align:middle line:84%
So I think when they see us
come up being compassionate

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.900 align:middle line:84%
and whatever is happening that
they realize that this is--

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.910 align:middle line:84%
they're very
highly-intelligent, obviously.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:58.284 align:middle line:84%
They already know
what everyone's

00:21:58.284 --> 00:21:59.520 align:middle line:90%
thinking that's there.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like there's
going to be some secret.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.930 align:middle line:84%
They just know,
like, we're trying

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.590 align:middle line:84%
to make an effort to save you,
if you'd like to get saved,

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:09.850 align:middle line:90%
and that's usually how it goes.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they're
judging just yet,

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:17.130 align:middle line:84%
because it's someone lending a
hand to you, when you're going

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.720 align:middle line:90%
down the river in the rapids.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So do you want to
take the hand, or you

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.090 align:middle line:84%
want to discuss what
your intention is first?

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good point.

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Ever been called to retrieve
a craft in the ocean?

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How do you
get them out of the sea?

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, the
time we get there,

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:37.710 align:middle line:84%
usually it's on an aircraft
carrier, on some other ship,

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.500 align:middle line:84%
where they have already
transported it to--

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's already
been pulled out?

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It's going to be
somewhere stateside at one

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:47.962 align:middle line:90%
of the military installations.

00:22:47.962 --> 00:22:49.170 align:middle line:90%
It's already been pulled out.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:49.440 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.540 align:middle line:84%
It's already been
pulled out, collected,

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.835 align:middle line:84%
quarantined to an area
until further notice.

00:22:54.835 --> 00:22:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So you're
not in a submarine,

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.790 align:middle line:90%
and you don't go down there.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:59.160 align:middle line:90%
It's already out of the water.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:22:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.633 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Once you've
done to the retrieval,

00:23:01.633 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and let's say you have helped
save an extraterrestrial,

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:09.000 align:middle line:84%
do they bring you back into
the picture or what happens?

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: No, the only time I've
seen an extraterrestrial twice

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:19.440 align:middle line:84%
is it was alive when
I saw it at the site,

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and maybe a month down the road,
I saw it in the projects dead.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:24.922 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen the
craft more than twice,

00:23:24.922 --> 00:23:26.880 align:middle line:84%
because they take the
craft, put them in areas,

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.160 align:middle line:84%
and study it and
take samples of it.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But generally, they
don't tap you to come back

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:32.920 align:middle line:90%
and help them again.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.071 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: On one hand, it's
got to be exciting for you.

00:23:36.071 --> 00:23:38.820 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, it's
got to be kind of sobering.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.370 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel, when
you're on these retrievals?

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.410 align:middle line:90%
We're adrenalized.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:44.550 align:middle line:90%
We're excited.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:45.660 align:middle line:90%
It's our job.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.990 align:middle line:84%
We're going there
more as the good guy,

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:53.070 align:middle line:90%
to help out, to communicate.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:56.829 align:middle line:84%
It's a time that you're kind
of enlightened a little bit.

00:23:56.829 --> 00:23:58.620 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
happened, don't forget.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm not allowed to
ask what happened.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:04.890 align:middle line:84%
I can ask the ET what happened,
and they can share with me

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:06.180 align:middle line:90%
some information.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:08.220 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, it's a job

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.310 align:middle line:84%
that we're there to do
very mission-oriented,

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:16.095 align:middle line:84%
and just personally, it's
a very exciting moment.

00:24:16.095 --> 00:24:17.737 align:middle line:90%
It can be very sad as well.

00:24:17.737 --> 00:24:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Of course.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Especially when you
see other beings that might be

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.210 align:middle line:84%
children or pets and
things like this.

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So once you get
to a retrieved operation,

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:31.080 align:middle line:84%
and it's sealed off, have
you noticed that anything

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.990 align:middle line:84%
environmentally in
the area changes?

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah, absolutely.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Once the craft's
removed, there are still

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:40.720 align:middle line:84%
many samples being
taken over the area,

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes the area
is sterilized, that

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.250 align:middle line:90%
means vaporized, everything.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And even when that
happens, there

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:55.650 align:middle line:84%
have been times that these areas
still had bugs in them, we say.

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.740 align:middle line:84%
There are still bugs there
left that we didn't get,

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.590 align:middle line:84%
and they mutated
with our plant life.

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:05.280 align:middle line:84%
They mutated with our insects,
and the things out there

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.540 align:middle line:90%
are changing.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
these new species that

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.830 align:middle line:84%
are discovered around
the planet everyday

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:13.140 align:middle line:84%
are because of some
of this happening,

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:18.150 align:middle line:84%
of these mutations from
otherworldly extraterrestrial

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:21.210 align:middle line:84%
craft and extraterrestrials
being introduced here.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it definitely has a
huge effect on the environment.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:28.149 align:middle line:84%
And there's a couple of craft
in Central and South America,

00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:29.940 align:middle line:84%
underneath the ground,
that have been there

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.540 align:middle line:84%
for quite some time, that
are very small but still

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:34.580 align:middle line:90%
operational.

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.454 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And still
changing the environment.

00:25:36.454 --> 00:25:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And the environment is
a completely beautiful "Avatar"

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.020 align:middle line:90%
land.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do they rope off
the area after the crashed

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.140 align:middle line:84%
retrieval has been taken
away, and they keep people out

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.620 align:middle line:90%
of the area for some time?

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: As long as they
need to collect samples,

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.820 align:middle line:90%
or depending on where it's at.

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Is it a high-vis area?

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Is it in the middle
of a jungle somewhere,

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.440 align:middle line:90%
where no one goes anyway?

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.200 align:middle line:84%
They keep it there for as long
as they need to take samples

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.300 align:middle line:84%
and get everything out
of there and collect,

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and then everything just
goes back to normal.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do you do
with an ET that is saved?

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I do not know
what they do with them.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.000 align:middle line:84%
I never went back
with a live ET.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.970 align:middle line:90%
That's not my job spec.

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:22.282 align:middle line:90%
I was only there to--

00:26:22.282 --> 00:26:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Not your pay grade.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, that
wasn't my thing.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I was only there to analyze
the bodies, the craft, the area

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:33.930 align:middle line:90%
of what happened.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Communicate with ET,
and if I could do that,

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:middle line:90%
we would try to save the ET.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But then
he's carted away?

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And then
he's carted away.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And you don't
know where he goes.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.217 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:26:45.217 --> 00:26:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did you
ever try to inquire?

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.389 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't inquire.

00:26:50.389 --> 00:26:52.430 align:middle line:84%

for being on the program.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:53.471 align:middle line:90%
