>>JAY WEIDNER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.450 align:middle line:90%
Jay Weidner here.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And we are back talking to
Jason Rice and continuing

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.030 align:middle line:84%
conversation about his
many exciting adventures

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.840 align:middle line:90%
in the Secret Space Program.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.640 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Jason.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>>JASON RICE: Hello, Jay.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.479 align:middle line:10%
And thank you for
having me today.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.604 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: Oh, it's been great.

00:00:33.604 --> 00:00:36.400 align:middle line:10%
Today I want to continue what
we started before, but get more

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.290 align:middle line:10%
into details on what was
going on with the ships.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So what were the
ships like that you were on?

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk about
the varieties of ships.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.560 align:middle line:84%
How many different varieties
of ships were you on?

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There were a
number of different types

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:90%
of ships that were used.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Generally, the types
of ships that we

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.670 align:middle line:84%
were boarded on to
depending on the mission.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.670 align:middle line:84%
If we were moving from one
interplanetary ship to another,

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:90%
it was one type of shuttle.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.600 align:middle line:84%
If we're doing a combat
landing on a planetary surface

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.800 align:middle line:84%
or on a moon surface, it was
a different kind of shuttle.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.320 align:middle line:84%
If we needed a closer
support vehicle,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.997 align:middle line:84%
it was a different type of
combat shuttle altogether.

00:01:16.997 --> 00:01:18.580 align:middle line:84%
There were a number
of missions that I

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.490 align:middle line:84%
flew in which we went to
go retrieve troops that

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.520 align:middle line:84%
were under fire or that
needed evacuations--

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.770 align:middle line:84%
it was a different
shuttle altogether.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:84%
They did use some
conventional aircraft

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.180 align:middle line:90%
on some of the missions.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And again, because of
the technology block out,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.640 align:middle line:84%
some of these aircraft
platforms were

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.240 align:middle line:84%
more appropriate for what
they allowed us to do,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.140 align:middle line:84%
although most of the air
support that we received

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.340 align:middle line:90%
was naval in origins.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So is this conventional
aircraft, like jets and B-52's.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Something akin to the
H-64 Apache attack helicopter.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.120 align:middle line:90%
That would be a close analog.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.800 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time, we used
our own combat shuttles which

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.860 align:middle line:90%
were anti-gravity shuttles.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Cloaking?

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sometimes.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:84%
If we needed them
to be, they were.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.620 align:middle line:84%
They had the systems on
board and the capabilities

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.010 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:84%
However, the enemies
that we fought

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.510 align:middle line:84%
didn't seem to be fooled
by a lot of the cloaking

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.810 align:middle line:90%
technologies that we used.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:84%
I suspect that that's because
most of that technology

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.250 align:middle line:84%
was fed to the other
side and programmed

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.310 align:middle line:90%
into their algorithms.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you ever see enemy
combatants using the cloaking

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.920 align:middle line:90%
technology?

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: No?

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Nope.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.930 align:middle line:90%
Sure didn't.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did they
see you using it?

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They could
see us using it.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Again, in numbers over two
seemed to be the magic number.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And once we exceeded
that amount,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:90%
they were able to pick it up.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.720 align:middle line:90%
And so it was like a magnet.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I was going to say--

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.466 align:middle line:84%
are these werewolf
creatures, could they

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.520 align:middle line:90%
see maybe a little better then?

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I suspected that there
were different wavelengths

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:84%
that they were
able to pick up on.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And again, it came
back to we were

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.150 align:middle line:84%
screaming for more intelligence
on what their capabilities are.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.160 align:middle line:84%
We boxed up and
crated off thousands

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.360 align:middle line:84%
of tons of biological
materials and did not

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.700 align:middle line:84%
get much back in the way
of, OK, what does it tell us

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.950 align:middle line:90%
about their capabilities.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.740 align:middle line:84%
At first, we were thinking
that, gosh, the brass just

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.910 align:middle line:90%
doesn't really care.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And then as time wore on,
and then the second planet,

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.650 align:middle line:84%
and then the more losses, and
the more combat experience,

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.960 align:middle line:84%
we began to realize that they
were asking for it as well,

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.190 align:middle line:90%
but they weren't getting it.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Of course.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So it wasn't that they
were withholding it from us.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.420 align:middle line:84%
But they just weren't
getting it themselves

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.040 align:middle line:84%
to give it to us to
be able to use it.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So these were more
like our space shuttles then?

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The ones
that I saw were,

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.260 align:middle line:84%
I think I'd
mentioned previously,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.310 align:middle line:84%
the combination shuttle
and the B2 stealth.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.810 align:middle line:90%
That was one type.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Another type was more of a
rectangular box-like shuttle.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Because it didn't need
to be aerodynamic,

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.300 align:middle line:84%
they didn't really care
what kind of shape it had.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And they essentially in a lot
of cases were just flying tanks.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they had so much
armor and so much firepower.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Non-projectile
most of the cases.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.790 align:middle line:84%
They were either using lasers,
or kinetic energy weapons,

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.986 align:middle line:84%
or gravitronics, or any number
of other weapons platforms.

00:04:28.986 --> 00:04:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And these
would be smaller ships

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.870 align:middle line:90%
that were just weaponized?

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.300 align:middle line:90%
Smaller ships.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Real fast and--

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Real fast.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.070 align:middle line:84%
There were smaller
ones even still

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:84%
that were about the size
of a full-sized pickup that

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.892 align:middle line:84%
were used for moving around
cargo or different things

00:04:45.892 --> 00:04:48.100 align:middle line:84%
that we needed from one side
of the base to the other

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.390 align:middle line:90%
or for supply runs.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So, many different ships
for many different purposes.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Many different kinds.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Many different kinds.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.660 align:middle line:84%
So we had larger ones--
the wedge-shaped ones--

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.630 align:middle line:84%
that were interstellar,
that were,

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.690 align:middle line:84%
gosh, I'd say at least
half a mile long.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they were enormous.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.830 align:middle line:84%
You could come up
underneath them.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And the images that were
piped into our seats--

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.760 align:middle line:84%
you could watch and
see the approach.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the shuttles
we were on had windows.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.220 align:middle line:84%
But through the video
and through the cameras

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.550 align:middle line:84%
that they had externally, you
could see what they look like.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Most of the ones that I
remember seeing in space

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.610 align:middle line:84%
were either a very
dark gray or black.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.890 align:middle line:84%
They had generally
very smooth sides,

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.790 align:middle line:84%
which would be indicative of a
need to enter the atmosphere.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.790 align:middle line:84%
But I'd never seen that
particularly large ship

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.100 align:middle line:90%
enter an atmosphere.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.780 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't mean it couldn't.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Are these
similar in look to what

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.440 align:middle line:84%
the TR-38's, the gigantic
wedge-shaped military weapon,

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.600 align:middle line:90%
I guess?

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They're more
arrowhead-shaped and less

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.274 align:middle line:84%
triangular-shaped
than the TR-38's.

00:06:03.274 --> 00:06:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So this would go from
solar system to solar system?

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Correct.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And did you
travel with a ship

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.440 align:middle line:90%
to get to these other planets?

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes, we did.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And the ships that
most of my unit

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.650 align:middle line:84%
was deployed onto for
combat deployments

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.580 align:middle line:84%
were on the cigar-shaped
ships because they were larger

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and they had enough room
for several thousand combat

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.174 align:middle line:84%
soldiers, and all of their
ground equipment, and gear,

00:06:27.174 --> 00:06:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and everything that we
needed to take with us.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And I presume
there were other

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.630 align:middle line:84%
smaller craft that would
travel with the mothership?

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Dozens, if not hundreds.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.650 align:middle line:84%
As part of the fleet,
each one of the carriers--

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.290 align:middle line:84%
the large ships that we were
a part of and stationed on--

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.840 align:middle line:84%
was considered to be the
main combatant, if you will.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.200 align:middle line:84%
But there were dozens,
if not hundreds,

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:54.230 align:middle line:84%
of other small ships that
were part of each fleet unit

00:06:54.230 --> 00:07:00.290 align:middle line:84%
that were from destroyer-sized
to cruiser-sized.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:05.060 align:middle line:84%
The Navy needed a wide range
of ships for multiple missions

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.090 align:middle line:84%
in order just to carry off its
main objective mission, which

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:13.590 align:middle line:84%
was to put soldiers on
exoplanets' surface,

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.240 align:middle line:84%
and to then protect
the skies and the space

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.260 align:middle line:90%
around those planets.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.250 align:middle line:84%
So they needed a wide
range of ships in order

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.380 align:middle line:90%
just to accomplish that mission.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: On the cigar-shaped
craft, were there windows?

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: None that I
ever remember seeing.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And deep space is filled
with incredibly dangerous

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.900 align:middle line:90%
cosmic rays.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how they
mitigated that danger?

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I do recall that,
while they didn't have windows,

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.700 align:middle line:84%
there were openings that had
fields that were over them.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And in those cases, you
could see through them

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.650 align:middle line:90%
to see outside.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Some of the same force fields
that we used on the ground

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.360 align:middle line:84%
were employed on the ships to
help hold in the atmosphere

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.220 align:middle line:84%
as well as keeping out
stuff from the outside.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.440 align:middle line:10%
And to get back to your
question of harmful x-rays,

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.410 align:middle line:10%
or harmful space rays, or
any number of deadly things

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:11.360 align:middle line:10%
that came from space, the holes
of those things for those ships

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.720 align:middle line:10%
that I was on were
a meter stick.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.930 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, it wasn't
paper thin, like you would

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.740 align:middle line:90%
see on conventional spacecraft.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Commercial spacecraft will have
a honeycombed, compressed, very

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.620 align:middle line:90%
light insulation layer.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And they'll have either aluminum
or some type of metallic.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And they'll have a
pressurized surface.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:39.140 align:middle line:84%
But generally speaking,
you could put a light round

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.559 align:middle line:84%
through all of it
all at one time.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:44.059 align:middle line:84%
The stuff though we
were on, it would

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:49.220 align:middle line:84%
have incorporated a water layer
as well as multiple layers

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:55.220 align:middle line:84%
of steel and advanced materials
to help protect the occupants.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What's the strangest
piece of technology

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.260 align:middle line:90%
that you witnessed?

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The strangest
and simplest was probably

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:90%
the individual insertion pods.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What are those?

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Sometimes, we
had to use shuttle craft

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.250 align:middle line:84%
to transfer from the ship
to the planetary surface.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, there were circumstances
in which we had the ability.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.800 align:middle line:84%
If we needed to, we could
have done orbital insertions.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is it's
an individual pod that

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:84%
has shielding on the outside to
protect for reentry purposes.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And basically, they
launch us on a trajectory

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.730 align:middle line:84%
and put us down where we're
needing to make a landing.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.280 align:middle line:90%
So you're combat suited up.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:90%
It's cooled on the inside.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.540 align:middle line:90%
It still gets hot.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.895 align:middle line:84%
But you go through reentry
procedures as an individual--

00:09:44.895 --> 00:09:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wait a minute.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.610 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that you enter
into a planet's atmosphere,

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.325 align:middle line:90%
you, as an individual soldier?

00:09:51.325 --> 00:09:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: As an individual
soldier in a--

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And you have
an exosuit that

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:90%
protects you from the reentry?

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: You're
wearing a combat suit.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.900 align:middle line:90%
And you are in a pod--

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.630 align:middle line:90%
a reentry pod.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.040 align:middle line:10%
And it's shielded.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's cooled, because
it still gets hot.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:90%
And so you go through.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And it has a single
anti-gravity generator on it

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:84%
that slows it down, reduces
the amount of inertia.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And then when it comes down
time to hit the ground, you hit.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.340 align:middle line:84%
You still hit hard, but
it's not enough to kill you.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's enough
that you survive.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.450 align:middle line:84%
The suit takes a
lot of the impact.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:90%
It's still a rough ride.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And the first one's
always the hardest.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.680 align:middle line:84%
But after that, it's
a matter of, OK,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.041 align:middle line:90%
it's a fast road on a bumpy car.

00:10:37.041 --> 00:10:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: That must
have been a thrill.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It was.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.857 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people turned off
their video sensors for it.

00:10:41.857 --> 00:10:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah, I would imagine so.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There was a
blackout period in which

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.720 align:middle line:90%
they didn't work at all.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.770 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of guys
turned them off entirely

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:49.860 align:middle line:90%
until they hit the ground.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.818 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And you did this
because you were trying

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:53.510 align:middle line:90%
to do something quickly, right?

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It usually came down
to expediency-- getting you

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.740 align:middle line:90%
there on time quickly.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.440 align:middle line:84%
If there were other craft
that you needed to have,

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.570 align:middle line:84%
say, a diversion to get
boots on the ground,

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.870 align:middle line:84%
then you'd use shuttle craft
for tactical reasons elsewhere.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And then these guys
would be inserted--

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.360 align:middle line:84%
or we would get
dropped and inserted.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: That must have been a
wild, like a minute and a half.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, it
was a wild ride.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.580 align:middle line:90%
We did not do many of those.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Most of the operations
that I was involved

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:84%
with-- and in fact, the only
time I did orbital insertions

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:28.050 align:middle line:84%
was training events,
recertification,

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.540 align:middle line:90%
making sure you're up to date.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.889 align:middle line:90%
And you still do it.

00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you never did
it in a combat situation?

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Not into a combat
zone, no-- thankfully.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What other kind of
weird technologies did you see?

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There was the
catalytic magnetic mirror

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:46.280 align:middle line:84%
system, which is a type
of shielding that we used.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the technologies

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:54.650 align:middle line:84%
that I've found evidence
of elsewhere, in which it's

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:59.870 align:middle line:84%
a shielding that reflects
any ballistics that

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.790 align:middle line:90%
are directed or fired at it.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:04.340 align:middle line:84%
They return it on
the same trajectory

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and at the same velocity
in which it was originally

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.740 align:middle line:84%
hit into the magnetic
mirror system.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And so it just basically turns
it around and reflects it back.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So if I fired
a high-caliber weapon

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.100 align:middle line:84%
at this thing, it would
come back and hit me?

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yep.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.610 align:middle line:84%
It would turn it back
around and return it

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:26.030 align:middle line:84%
on the original trajectory
that it was fired upon.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.560 align:middle line:84%
If you'd moved,
it would miss you.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.630 align:middle line:84%
But if you didn't move, it
would hit right where you were.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:31.504 align:middle line:90%
So that was--

00:12:31.504 --> 00:12:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Quite a weapon.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Quite a weapon system.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.620 align:middle line:84%
A defensive and a
very effective--

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.300 align:middle line:84%
again, another
one of the systems

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.790 align:middle line:90%
that we weren't allowed to use.

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:84%
They wanted us not to use some
of the more interesting toys

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.780 align:middle line:84%
because they were afraid of
the technology jumps or leaks.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Oh, so that
you would actually

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.080 align:middle line:84%
come up with how this
thing was working?

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.846 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
you to find out?

00:12:56.846 --> 00:12:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: No, they
just didn't want

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:02.480 align:middle line:84%
us to use the large-area
shields that we had

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.890 align:middle line:90%
the capability of setting up.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.530 align:middle line:84%
We had the ability to
set up shields that were

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:90%
able to defend an entire base.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.020 align:middle line:90%
Did they let us use those?

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:10.820 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: That would be the
ultimate defense, for sure.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah, it would.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And there were others that we
had-- other defensive shielding

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.640 align:middle line:90%
systems that we used.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Again, most of them got
their start in the Navy

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.440 align:middle line:90%
based on the naval needs.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And then they had been, through
time and combat Darwinism,

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:31.370 align:middle line:90%
been adapted to ground combat.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Any other ships or
anything that you can recall?

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There is another combat
suit system that was used.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.410 align:middle line:90%
It was a combat heavy suit.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, these were
basically walking tanks.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Another reference
would be like a mech

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:84%
that you may have
heard or seen in which

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:53.450 align:middle line:84%
it's a very large mechanized
tank, if you will,

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:57.800 align:middle line:84%
that a person wears, except
it's an overly-sized system

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.880 align:middle line:84%
with heavy fire
support capabilities.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Sort of like the
things in "Avatar" or what?

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.980 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: Yeah, kind of like that,
except it's a walking artillery

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.075 align:middle line:10%
piece, is what it is.

00:14:08.075 --> 00:14:12.590 align:middle line:10%
It was used for mortars
or for artillery uses

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:14.086 align:middle line:10%
for heavy combat.

00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:15.335 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: So it could take a hit?

00:14:15.335 --> 00:14:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It could take
a hit and it also

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:21.200 align:middle line:84%
can carry all of the ammunition,
which is the biggest reason why

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.250 align:middle line:90%
it was so large and heavy.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So it augments
the strength of a man

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.840 align:middle line:84%
so they can carry heavier
objects, and heavier weapons,

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.940 align:middle line:90%
and run fast?

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They can move as fast
as the other combat troops.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.830 align:middle line:84%
They were slowed down by
the size of these units.

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the
limitations, is that, OK,

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.650 align:middle line:84%
they can't run 100 miles an hour
like some of the other combat

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:46.640 align:middle line:90%
suits.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.375 align:middle line:84%
But they were able to
do 70-80 miles an hour.

00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Are you
telling me there's

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:84%
some combat suits that allows
a man to run 100 miles an hour?

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Or jump 300 feet.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the cigar-shaped
ship you were on,

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.300 align:middle line:84%
did this ship park in orbit,
then you take smaller ships

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.420 align:middle line:90%
down to the surface?

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.440 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.760 align:middle line:84%
The ship would take
up a stationary orbit

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.020 align:middle line:90%
around a planet.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And then from this ship, we
would dispatch through shuttles

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.520 align:middle line:84%
or through other smaller
interplanetary ships,

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.820 align:middle line:84%
or other shuttles that we took
from another ship to this ship,

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.100 align:middle line:84%
or this ship to another
ship, back and forth.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: This
cigar-shaped ship-- do

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.720 align:middle line:84%
you know what was causing it to
move through space, what kind

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.130 align:middle line:90%
of propulsion system it had?

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, we weren't privy
to the engineering spaces

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:38.040 align:middle line:90%
on the large naval ships.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:84%
We were not cleared
for that information.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:84%
However, I suspect that it was
a gravity metric type of system

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:53.110 align:middle line:84%
in which it does not rely
on a gravity well to work.

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:57.720 align:middle line:84%
There are also other types
of propulsion systems

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:03.300 align:middle line:90%
that rely on quantum mechanics--

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:10.560 align:middle line:84%
the slope and shape of the
underlying time space fabric

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:84%
underneath, gripping,
moving, sliding along it.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:19.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know specifically
what type of propulsion systems

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.140 align:middle line:90%
were used on these larger ships.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.530 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that I
feel and have a suspicion

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:28.890 align:middle line:84%
that they were some
type of gravity

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:32.430 align:middle line:84%
or anti-gravity-producing
device.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the time
that it took to travel

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:84%
from, say, Mars to the Planet
1, how long did that take?

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Now, that's a
great question, Jay.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I say
it's a great question

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:46.590 align:middle line:84%
is because they deliberately
put out disinformation

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.480 align:middle line:84%
as far as the travel
time between planets.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.700 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that after
a couple of jumps.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And when I realized
that it had taken

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:59.370 align:middle line:84%
us less time on a
particular voyage

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.190 align:middle line:84%
than it had previously
on the same ship,

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:07.619 align:middle line:84%
I realized that they had
shorter times than they told us.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:10.050 align:middle line:90%
So we would be on board ship.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And they would tell
us that, hey, this

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.440 align:middle line:90%
is going to take two weeks.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.359 align:middle line:84%
Plan on being down here
locked up for two weeks.

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:23.099 align:middle line:84%
And it may have taken them
a few days to make the trip.

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't want us to
know how far they traveled;

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:30.270 align:middle line:84%
how long it really had taken;
the method of their travel

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.790 align:middle line:84%
or transport from one place
to another, whether it was

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.100 align:middle line:90%
by portal or it was by drive.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And so they put out
disinformation specifically

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.680 align:middle line:84%
to keep us thrown off and so
we weren't aware of how long

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.380 align:middle line:84%
it really took to get from
one planet to the next.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So it could have been
minutes, in which case

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.290 align:middle line:84%
they'd gone through
a portal, or it

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.330 align:middle line:84%
could have been
days, in which they'd

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.700 align:middle line:84%
had to traverse
certain areas of space

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.573 align:middle line:84%
before they made it
to a portal, or it

00:17:58.573 --> 00:18:00.670 align:middle line:84%
could have taken
weeks, in which case

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:04.290 align:middle line:84%
they'd used some form
of FTL transportation--

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:05.280 align:middle line:90%
Faster Than Light.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the smaller
craft that you

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.990 align:middle line:84%
would be on sometimes--
transport shuttles--

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.002 align:middle line:90%
how many men would that hold?

00:18:12.002 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There were a number of
different transport shuttles

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.990 align:middle line:90%
that we used.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:20.220 align:middle line:84%
The one, for instance, during
my trip to the conference

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:84%
was a cargo shuttle that
had been converted over

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.580 align:middle line:90%
to a transport for personnel.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.670 align:middle line:84%
The forward third section
was converted over

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.700 align:middle line:84%
and had seats and
aisles, just like you'd

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.810 align:middle line:84%
see on a conventional aircraft
today, commercial aircraft.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:42.550 align:middle line:84%
The remaining aft 2/3 was
just open cargo space--

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:90%
a wide open space.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Pictures you see of
a large C5 galaxy

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.480 align:middle line:84%
with its vast
cavernous insides--

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.870 align:middle line:90%
it looked a lot like that.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.245 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And these are
the smaller ones?

00:18:54.245 --> 00:18:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So this
was a larger one.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.369 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And what are
the smaller ones like?

00:18:57.369 --> 00:18:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The smaller
ones on the inside

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:04.500 align:middle line:84%
are reinforced with ribs,
and reinforcing columns,

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.790 align:middle line:84%
the steel beams, if
you will, that mark out

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.850 align:middle line:90%
the ribs of the aircraft.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:16.590 align:middle line:84%
They could be anywhere from
bus-sized to truck-sized on up

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:90%
to a jumbo jet--

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:22.890 align:middle line:90%
a wide range of sizes.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.640 align:middle line:84%
How many people they held
depended on the size.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.160 align:middle line:84%
I remember one
particular shuttle

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.830 align:middle line:84%
that we had a mission where
we went to go retrieve a power

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:37.410 align:middle line:84%
cell from this city that
had been mostly destroyed

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:38.340 align:middle line:90%
after the war.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And there were 12
of us that were

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:90%
on that particular shuttle.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember having
all our gear just everywhere.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:47.640 align:middle line:90%
And there were no formal seats.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:84%
We all sat on the deck to get
from one place to the next.

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was about the
size of a school bus.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And we were all
comfortable inside.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:84%
But then other times,
I was in a shuttle

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:06.470 align:middle line:84%
that was maybe the size
of a van, in which we

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:90%
were moving cargo.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And then yet another time, one
of the combat shuttles I was in

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:14.650 align:middle line:84%
was about the size of a
small commercial aircraft.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:18.870 align:middle line:84%
It had a rear deck
open door that opened.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And it had a gun right
in the middle of the deck

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.460 align:middle line:84%
as well as all the
armaments on the outside.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Could the
shuttle maneuver

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.360 align:middle line:90%
into tight places and things?

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Very much so.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.190 align:middle line:84%
They were all anti-gravity
powered, at least all the ones

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.480 align:middle line:90%
that I traveled on.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And they could land on a
dime if they needed to.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.580 align:middle line:84%
They could also
traverse sideways, up,

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.900 align:middle line:84%
down, left, right,
fast, forward, reverse--

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:90%
take your pick.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, the
pilots kept it down for us

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:59.690 align:middle line:84%
ground pounders to a
non-nausea-inducing speed,

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.050 align:middle line:90%
change in direction.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Because even though the
inertia is canceled out

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.240 align:middle line:84%
inside the aircraft,
visually, it's

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.140 align:middle line:84%
still very disturbing
to most people

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.830 align:middle line:84%
that aren't used to it to
go from 90-degree turns

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:17.160 align:middle line:84%
and angles, and
change in orientation.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.932 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you're in a
bubble of some kind?

00:21:18.932 --> 00:21:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And that
stops the inertia

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.290 align:middle line:84%
so you could take a hard right
turn at 300 miles an hour

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:26.770 align:middle line:90%
and nothing would happen inside?

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:27.525 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Go faster, right.

00:21:27.525 --> 00:21:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And this bubble-- but it travels
with the craft and protects it?

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, it is
part of the inertia dump

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:42.785 align:middle line:84%
system of the propulsion system
as a side effect, if you will.

00:21:42.785 --> 00:21:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: A pretty
good side effect.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, it's
a fantastic one.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And you think there's
some plan there?

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And I would guess that
the UFOs that we witness here

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.750 align:middle line:84%
on Earth must have that same
kind of bubble around them

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.570 align:middle line:84%
because of the hard right
turns, and hard left turns,

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:00.310 align:middle line:84%
and sudden acceleration
that we witness.

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, nothing
alive or living

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:06.240 align:middle line:84%
that we're familiar with
would ever survive a 300 G

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.462 align:middle line:90%
90-degree right turn.

00:22:07.462 --> 00:22:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: No, their DNA
would be ripped to shreds.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:10.295 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:22:10.295 --> 00:22:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Can a passer by
see the ship's bubble?

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:15.350 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.720 align:middle line:90%
It's invisible.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.990 align:middle line:84%
It's an invisible energy
field that projects out

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:26.130 align:middle line:84%
to the distance that is just
beyond the furthest edge

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:31.470 align:middle line:84%
of the physical craft so that
everything-- and that geometry

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:35.310 align:middle line:84%
is based on where they
place the anti-gravity pods

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:38.260 align:middle line:84%
or the anti-gravity
engines, if you will.

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And so that geometry can be
arranged and changed depending

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.610 align:middle line:90%
on where they need it to be.

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:48.260 align:middle line:10%
If they need to have,
in some circumstances,

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:52.410 align:middle line:10%
these shuttles had
weapons pods out the side,

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:57.270 align:middle line:10%
then they would locate those
engines or those power plants

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.150 align:middle line:10%
at a place where the
bubble was included

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:04.090 align:middle line:10%
outside the bounds of
those weapons pods.

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Would you have to turn off the
bubble to fire the weapons?

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:13.000 align:middle line:84%
The weapons that we used
were kinetic energy weapons.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.840 align:middle line:90%
They were non-projectiles.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So how were
these craft controlled?

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Was it the mind link that
you had with the suits

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.396 align:middle line:90%
or did they use physical--

00:23:21.396 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The smaller
craft that we

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.680 align:middle line:84%
used for moving equipment
and materials from one

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.260 align:middle line:84%
side of the airport or
the base to the other,

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.500 align:middle line:90%
those were manual controls.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.370 align:middle line:84%
They were forklifts,
if you will.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.040 align:middle line:84%
But the larger
ones, the shuttles,

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.960 align:middle line:84%
the Navy pilots
that flew those--

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.820 align:middle line:84%
they used neural interfaces
for them as well.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:44.070 align:middle line:84%
At one point, I was able to take
up the door gunner on a shuttle

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.880 align:middle line:90%
operation.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And the helmet that I had
was tied into the pilot's

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:90%
communication system.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I was able to
communicate with the pilot,

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and hear what they were doing
and how they were doing things.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.200 align:middle line:84%
During my time in
the military, I

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.400 align:middle line:84%
did not have that same
experience in overhearing

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.087 align:middle line:90%
pilots talking to their craft.

00:24:05.087 --> 00:24:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: They didn't have to talk.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They didn't have to.

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:07.980 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Because they had
this one area of their brain

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.470 align:middle line:84%
that they were communicating
with the craft with.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:12.428 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:24:12.428 --> 00:24:13.980 align:middle line:84%
They had a direct
neural interface.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And I only heard what
I was allowed to hear

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:19.076 align:middle line:90%
and nothing more.

00:24:19.076 --> 00:24:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And it would be
very stealthy to have

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:25.270 align:middle line:84%
a telepathic communication
that can't be monitored.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.280 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And they can get orders
that other people may not

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.450 align:middle line:84%
like and give orders that
other people may not like,

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:35.899 align:middle line:90%
and keep it off of an open net.

00:24:35.899 --> 00:24:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Was there a
control panel that

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.600 align:middle line:90%
allowed the psychic interface?

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The neural
interface that they had with

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:45.090 align:middle line:84%
their respective
shuttles or their craft--

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:50.280 align:middle line:84%
the two-way interface that they
would have had would have been

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:55.980 align:middle line:84%
updates, or status, or
damage, or ammunition counts,

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.020 align:middle line:84%
fuel counts, those
kinds of things,

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:01.260 align:middle line:84%
as far as reporting
to the pilot, hey,

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.640 align:middle line:84%
this is where our
fuel is at, hey,

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.470 align:middle line:84%
this is where we're
at on ammunition--

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:11.250 align:middle line:84%
those kinds of beans
and bullets reports.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Would those
come in into the brain

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.210 align:middle line:84%
or would it just be on
a monitor somewhere?

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:16.751 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The pilots
could set that up.

00:25:16.751 --> 00:25:19.380 align:middle line:84%
They had their own SOP's
that were required.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.930 align:middle line:84%
But they could set
that up depending

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:22.250 align:middle line:90%
on how they wanted it.

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.020 align:middle line:84%
If they wanted the
ship to tell them

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.470 align:middle line:84%
every time they used a
bullet, or a round, or a bomb,

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:30.380 align:middle line:84%
or they used up 1
gram of fuel, they

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.930 align:middle line:84%
could set it up that
way so that it would

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:34.690 align:middle line:90%
inform them and tell them.

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What did the
control panel look like?

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The control
panels that I saw

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.110 align:middle line:90%
were all very, very futuristic.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:47.690 align:middle line:90%


00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:50.120 align:middle line:84%
From what you could
see without being

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.480 align:middle line:84%
tied into the neural interface,
there's a lot of holographics

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.480 align:middle line:84%
that the pilots see that you
just don't see otherwise.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are placement
points that mark and identify

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.020 align:middle line:84%
different readouts or different
pieces of indications.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:10.080 align:middle line:84%
But to look at it just
without the interface,

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:16.460 align:middle line:84%
it looks like a little
aluminum or a small nub,

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.650 align:middle line:90%
one on each side--

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:22.320 align:middle line:84%
just looks like a whole series
or a whole bunch of them.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:26.840 align:middle line:84%
There's some glass
in some places.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.380 align:middle line:84%
There are glass
panels that they use

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:33.620 align:middle line:90%
for touching and for controls.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.520 align:middle line:84%
But once they have the
neural interface, all of that

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.460 align:middle line:90%
comes alive.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.100 align:middle line:90%
And so everything becomes 3D.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And everything becomes
graphic and a full interface.

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And they have all their heads-up
displays, and their altitudes,

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:50.930 align:middle line:84%
and the power, and the
RPMs, and anything else

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:53.090 align:middle line:84%
that they need to
fly that craft.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did any of
you guys ever ask

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:57.740 align:middle line:84%
if this technology was going
to ever be released on Earth

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.050 align:middle line:84%
or did that just not
even occur to you?

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: We were told back
during our original training

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:09.770 align:middle line:84%
about an invasion that
occurred in Africa in 1995

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:13.730 align:middle line:84%
by an alien enemy
that was beat off by,

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:18.500 align:middle line:84%
according to what they told
us, an advanced unit that

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.907 align:middle line:84%
was equipped with
advanced technology.

00:27:20.907 --> 00:27:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
only reason that they

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:24.650 align:middle line:90%
were able to defeat it.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:28.740 align:middle line:84%
We had teamed up with
a number of alien ETs.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.060 align:middle line:84%
We were able to develop
more technologies that

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.040 align:middle line:90%
allowed us to get off planet.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And so as part of that
technology exchange,

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:43.010 align:middle line:84%
we agreed to help go out and
defend these other planets.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.320 align:middle line:90%
We now had defenses on Earth.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And we were helping
other planets

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:51.080 align:middle line:84%
to defend theirs from
the same invading enemy.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:58.650 align:middle line:84%
So what we were told was vastly
different than the reality.

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:00.740 align:middle line:84%
But what they told us
was that eventually,

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.930 align:middle line:84%
the technology
would be available

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:04.280 align:middle line:90%
to the general public.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.700 align:middle line:84%
But they were worried about a
widespread civilization upset

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:84%
if the information about
the invasion in 1995

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.100 align:middle line:90%
had become public.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And about any leaks
about this supposed invasion

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:16.960 align:middle line:90%
into Africa that you've seen?

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No, no.

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I presume there was
redundancy in the system

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:23.580 align:middle line:84%
so that if the pilot had a
heart attack or something,

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.820 align:middle line:84%
there'd be someone
else who could step in?

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Each of the shuttle's
had at least two pilots.

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And then some of them
had a separate commander.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the larger shuttles
that I'd gone into

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.140 align:middle line:84%
had an entire crew
of about 30 people.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: All of them
capable of this?

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Not all of them
capable of flying the shuttle.

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:52.730 align:middle line:84%
However, the computer AI system
that they used was smart enough

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.910 align:middle line:84%
that it could do it in the
event that the three or four--

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:58.400 align:middle line:84%
some of the larger shuttles
had half a dozen people that

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.080 align:middle line:90%
we're capable of flying--

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:03.950 align:middle line:84%
that if for some reason those
six people couldn't do it,

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:07.680 align:middle line:84%
then the automated systems could
do what they needed it to do.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.220 align:middle line:84%
You could just talk to it
and tell it or direct it.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Different levels
of communication?

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Did you guys use drones
in your battle situations,

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.459 align:middle line:84%
and in situations in
space, and all that?

00:29:18.459 --> 00:29:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That's a
great question, Jay.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, to answer
your question, yes, we

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.564 align:middle line:84%
used a tremendous amount
of drones in combat.

00:29:26.564 --> 00:29:27.980 align:middle line:84%
That was one of
the things that we

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:32.010 align:middle line:84%
were able to use as
far as technology-wise.

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Most of the drones that
we used were stealth.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.740 align:middle line:84%
So they had the
camouflage abilities.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:46.070 align:middle line:84%
One of my first experiences
in combat on Calidus 3

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:48.660 align:middle line:90%
involved an alien drone.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:54.860 align:middle line:84%
It was an instance where they
had infiltrated and placed

00:29:54.860 --> 00:30:01.370 align:middle line:84%
a pre-invasion scout that
was there and looked exactly

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:06.170 align:middle line:84%
like a lot of the other humanoid
beings that lived there.

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And we were helping this
one particular neighborhood

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:13.220 align:middle line:84%
with preparations by clearing
out trees, and helping

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:18.310 align:middle line:84%
them set up berms, and
pitfalls, and collection points,

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.550 align:middle line:84%
and this is where you
should have your storage,

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and basically getting
them organized.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the process of
talking to this neighborhood.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
neighborhood's inhabitants

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.910 align:middle line:84%
turned out to be one
of the alien scouts.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:37.680 align:middle line:90%
And he split open like a clam.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And out of him came four
drones that split and went

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.060 align:middle line:84%
into the four
cardinal directions.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first
enemy drone that I had seen.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.990 align:middle line:84%
One of them lined
up on what I thought

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:55.290 align:middle line:84%
was going to be a
firing run for myself.

00:30:55.290 --> 00:31:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And luckily, one of my soldiers
that was over by the TP'd

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.644 align:middle line:90%
plasma rifles that we had--

00:31:02.644 --> 00:31:04.310 align:middle line:84%
because we weren't
carrying them around.

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't expect the
enemies to be there yet.

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:08.820 align:middle line:90%
But we haven't we were armed.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:13.166 align:middle line:84%
And for standard procedures,
we TP'd our rifles.

00:31:13.166 --> 00:31:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And one person was
there the whole time

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:16.870 align:middle line:90%
to stand guard over it.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And he picked one
up and shot it down.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.950 align:middle line:84%
That was my first experience
with an enemy drone.

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:24.720 align:middle line:84%
But to answer your
question, yes, we

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.390 align:middle line:90%
used drones all the time.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, Jason,
it's been really a lot

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.570 align:middle line:84%
of fun having you here and
learning all the things

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:31.530 align:middle line:90%
that you experienced.

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:32.409 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming.

00:31:32.409 --> 00:31:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, thank
you for having me, Jay.

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.892 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's all
about disclosure.

00:31:35.892 --> 00:31:37.280 align:middle line:90%

>> Coming this season
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:43.070 align:middle line:10%

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.360 align:middle line:10%
government agencies,
the military,

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.760 align:middle line:10%
and secret space programs--

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.652 align:middle line:10%
>> They're actually fighting
over who's going to get it.

00:31:49.652 --> 00:31:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is going
to be things that

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:54.590 align:middle line:84%
are going to help us survive
into the next millennium.

00:31:54.590 --> 00:32:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The ultimate goal of merging
being with technology is

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:03.190 align:middle line:84%
ultimately where they
were heading towards.
