>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.090 align:middle line:10%
we're with Colonel Randy Cramer,
who has participated in a covert

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.290 align:middle line:10%
military space program called
the Earth Defense Force.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Today we are talking about
ancient computer-like

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.550 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.870 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY CRAMER:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I heard
from another source

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.430 align:middle line:84%
that there's a huge underground
network around planet Earth

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.780 align:middle line:84%
that connects all these
different sacred sites

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.450 align:middle line:90%
into some computer.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:90%
Is there any truth to that?

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, as
near as we understand,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.430 align:middle line:84%
there are a network of what we
refer to as a living computer

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.220 align:middle line:84%
system, which is not the
same thing to call it

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.730 align:middle line:90%
an artificial intelligence.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Because they're alive,
they have to be grown,

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.298 align:middle line:90%
they develop a person develops.

00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They have
their own consciousness?

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.965 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:01:08.965 --> 00:01:11.125 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these
living computers

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:12.500 align:middle line:84%
would have its
own consciousness,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.200 align:middle line:84%
its own personality, its
own personality traits,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.773 align:middle line:84%
its own job that is determined
by some ancient criteria

00:01:20.773 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:84%
when they were built
and put into place.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: How old do they get?

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The ones that
currently we're talking about,

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.510 align:middle line:84%
we presume they're all
over 100,000 years old,

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.375 align:middle line:84%
somewhere between
100,000 and 150,000.

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe more, but somewhere
probably between 100,000,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.960 align:middle line:90%
150,000 years old.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where are
these living computers?

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And is it specific
to their location

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.470 align:middle line:90%
why they're at that location?

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: There's
probably a relationship,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.150 align:middle line:84%
why they were placed
in those locations

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.150 align:middle line:84%
or that the center of these
ancient sites and locations

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.980 align:middle line:84%
are maybe what they are also
because that living computer was

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.780 align:middle line:90%
put there.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.660 align:middle line:90%
So a chicken-and-egg question.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Like, was the computer put there
and the site built around it,

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.600 align:middle line:84%
or was the site
built first and then

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.320 align:middle line:84%
the living computer placed
underneath or at the center

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.120 align:middle line:90%
of it?

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.949 align:middle line:90%
That's a vague question.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.990 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking about
places like Antarctica, Giza

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.730 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt, India, China.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And then one here in
the American Southwest,

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:84%
which I cannot tell you
exactly where it is,

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.750 align:middle line:90%
even though I've been there.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are these living
computers in the Earth's crust

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.730 align:middle line:84%
or does it expand into the
atmosphere and the oceans?

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.530 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Most of them are
fairly deep underground

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.120 align:middle line:90%
is where they're centered.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Their range of
influence or control

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.570 align:middle line:84%
probably extends
quite beyond that

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and into the sites, structures,
architecture, archaeology

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.090 align:middle line:84%
that surrounds them
of those areas.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What other sites,
let's say, are they under?

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, we
speculate that at one point,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.480 align:middle line:84%
they were under just
about every site known.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.320 align:middle line:84%
What we think is
occurring presently

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:84%
is that not every
living computer

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.990 align:middle line:84%
that was ever in one of
these sites still functions

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.560 align:middle line:90%
or is still alive.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.200 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are dead.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Some of them no longer
function properly.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So of what we consider
of living functional

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.360 align:middle line:84%
ones occur in these certain
very specific areas.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.510 align:middle line:84%
But we speculate there's
probably more, and at one point,

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.010 align:middle line:90%
there were even more than that.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But specific
site meaning site--

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.620 align:middle line:90%
can you give us some examples?

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.370 align:middle line:90%
You said Giza being one of them.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sure.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids on top is almost
a certain indication

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:84%
that there is either--
were used to be

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.420 align:middle line:84%
or was one of these living
computers underneath,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:84%
or that it is at least
connected to a network that

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.690 align:middle line:84%
would connect to one of
these living computers.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So let's, for
instance, say we know

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:84%
that China has a
bunch of pyramids

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:90%
that they have camouflaged.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.510 align:middle line:84%
That they pretend that they
don't have, but they have.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.660 align:middle line:84%
We can see them from
satellites and so forth.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.300 align:middle line:84%
So we would suggest
that if there's

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.630 align:middle line:84%
a living computer under one
central pyramid, that it would

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.100 align:middle line:84%
be connected like in a network
to many of these other pyramid

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.060 align:middle line:90%
structures that are also there.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.790 align:middle line:84%
But how many functional
living computers still exist

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.510 align:middle line:90%
is a mysterious question.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.860 align:middle line:84%
We know that there are centrally
located positions where

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:90%
these living computers are now.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.960 align:middle line:84%
But, again, we
speculate that there

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:84%
was a larger connection of
many more of these living

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.890 align:middle line:90%
computers at one point.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So many of these locations,
the living computer

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.780 align:middle line:84%
is either no longer functioning
or has terminated-- its life

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.210 align:middle line:90%
functions have terminated.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why do you think the
governments are camouflaging?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I've seen
this so many times

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.370 align:middle line:84%
all over Google Earth,
including the pyramids of India,

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.160 align:middle line:84%
and Serbia, and Italy, and Peru,
and even down in the islands.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.520 align:middle line:90%
Why are they blurring these out?

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I-- for the same
reason that we think that

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.700 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptologists aren't
showing us what's-- everything

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.560 align:middle line:84%
that's underneath the plateau of
Giza because there's functioning

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:90%
electrical equipment.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And if as an archaeologist,
if you were to say,

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.610 align:middle line:84%
there's a functioning piece
of electrical equipment here,

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.760 align:middle line:84%
you all of a sudden have
to change everything

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.500 align:middle line:84%
that you've ever said about
the past, about archeology.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:84%
That's a game-changing piece of
information to say that there is

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.560 align:middle line:84%
a piece of electronic equipment
that is still functioning

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.950 align:middle line:84%
and has been there for
at least 10,000 years.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.860 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people that
would get into a lot of trouble

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.690 align:middle line:84%
if they tried to
say that publicly

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.588 align:middle line:84%
or tried to release
that information.

00:05:41.588 --> 00:05:43.630 align:middle line:84%
They would not be-- it
would not be well received

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.960 align:middle line:90%
by a lot of folks.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are the
purposes of these living

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.630 align:middle line:90%
computers, as you call them?

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: As near as
we can understand,

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle line:84%
their main function is
bureaucratic management.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So that essentially
the most secure way

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.620 align:middle line:84%
in which these ancient
civilizations functioned

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.920 align:middle line:84%
was to have a living computer
as its central bureaucracy.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have
a living computer

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.140 align:middle line:84%
as your central
bureaucracy, you don't

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:90%
have a corrupt bureaucracy.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You're saying this
past tense, I've noticed.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: If we're talking
about these systems

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.230 align:middle line:84%
here on planet Earth
as we know them now,

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.140 align:middle line:84%
we would presume
that most of that

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.460 align:middle line:84%
occurred a very,
very long time ago.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.060 align:middle line:84%
We would also presume
that many of them

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:84%
still continue to
function in this way

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and would presume that is
still their standard function,

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.270 align:middle line:84%
but may not be connected with
enough of our civilization

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.650 align:middle line:90%
for it to matter at the moment.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle line:90%
But that may be changing.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you allowed
to share that with us?

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Or just, can you share
with us, are there

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.330 align:middle line:84%
any extraterrestrial current
beings in inner Earth

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.120 align:middle line:84%
that are utilizing
this technology?

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That is where it
gets very interesting, yes.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.100 align:middle line:84%
It's when we cross the
threshold from looking

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.210 align:middle line:84%
at this as ancient
archaeological evidence to what

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.660 align:middle line:84%
current extraterrestrial
or non-human intelligence

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.410 align:middle line:90%
uses this technology.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out everybody
uses this technology.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.940 align:middle line:84%
We don't know of
an advanced type I

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.400 align:middle line:84%
civilization species
that does not

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.000 align:middle line:84%
have a living computer at the
center of its bureaucracy.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.240 align:middle line:84%
It's just it's
incredibly common.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Most species don't
make their own.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.560 align:middle line:84%
They are made by
reputable species.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.760 align:middle line:84%
That's all they do, is they
make these incredibly large,

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.230 align:middle line:84%
incredibly intelligent,
long-lived intelligent living

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.310 align:middle line:84%
computers to act as the
bureaucratic central computing

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
system for entire
civilized worlds.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are only
certain civilized worlds

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:53.560 align:middle line:84%
here on this planet and in the
universe capable of extracting

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.810 align:middle line:84%
the energy you speak
of, these things,

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.070 align:middle line:84%
is it like the Tesla charging
station of the universe?

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That's
a good question.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.060 align:middle line:90%
The answer is, might be, maybe.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.750 align:middle line:84%
I think what we are finding
is the fascinating aspect

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:84%
of this part of it
is that you have

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.030 align:middle line:84%
these offworld extraterrestrial
living computers that

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.750 align:middle line:84%
are much younger by age
standards than the ones

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.010 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about
here on planet Earth.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.570 align:middle line:84%
But the really fascinating
part of this story

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.190 align:middle line:84%
is when they started
talking to each other.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.300 align:middle line:84%
So recently, it
became very clear

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.850 align:middle line:84%
through literal
bells and whistles

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:84%
going off in these
computer system

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.409 align:middle line:84%
operating centers that
they're communicating.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:42.429 align:middle line:84%
And we think that because
the purpose of say,

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:45.750 align:middle line:84%
an offworld sentient
intelligent living computer

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.930 align:middle line:84%
is to act as a
bureaucratic functionary,

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.710 align:middle line:84%
that the only reason that
they are communicating right

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.650 align:middle line:84%
now with these living
computers on our own world

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:84%
is because they're trying
to update their operating

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.840 align:middle line:84%
systems based on a, let's
call it a future need.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How do they know
they're communicating,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.650 align:middle line:90%
and what are they communicating?

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: One of the
things that we have,

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:84%
what we call the strongest
indicator that they

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.170 align:middle line:84%
are communicating is
the signaling that

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.840 align:middle line:84%
seems to be coming from these
panels, which is identical.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.400 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing a coding
system of mathematics, colors,

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.150 align:middle line:84%
sounds that are repeating,
that are identical.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.080 align:middle line:84%
That are the same
communication messages

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.570 align:middle line:84%
showing up on one
column dashboard,

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:36.950 align:middle line:90%
showing up on another.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And then what appear to be
the sending and receiving

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.860 align:middle line:84%
of these flashes of
sound and information

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:84%
that are going from
one to the other that

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.960 align:middle line:84%
also seem to be coming from
an offworld source as well.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is this a linear
connection, like a cell tower,

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.850 align:middle line:84%
or is this a
nonlinear connection?

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.430 align:middle line:90%
How could you explain that?

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That's a tough one
because most of the people that

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:84%
are able to discern
what is happening here

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.920 align:middle line:84%
are our psionic specialists,
because this appears

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.970 align:middle line:84%
to be more of a form of
telepathic communication

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:13.380 align:middle line:84%
between these living
computers than it is a radio

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.440 align:middle line:90%
communication.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So these living computers
seem to be communicating

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:84%
through an evolved,
sophisticated form of, let's

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.510 align:middle line:84%
call it, technological
telepathy, which is not

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.180 align:middle line:84%
the same as of communicating
with a radio or microwave,

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.590 align:middle line:90%
if that makes any sense.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So if they're
are psionic and alive,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.110 align:middle line:90%
are they also a machine?

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, they're
definitely both.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.820 align:middle line:84%
They have an organic
component and they

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.680 align:middle line:90%
have a mechanical component.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And why do you
think all of a sudden

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.460 align:middle line:84%
the psionic agents
are picking this up.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it just all
of a sudden they're

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:54.330 align:middle line:84%
communicating with other
offworld organic computers--

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.400 align:middle line:90%
living computers, sorry.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Again,
our best speculation

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:02.420 align:middle line:84%
is that it appears that the
offworld living computers are

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.440 align:middle line:84%
communicating with our
ground living computers

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.880 align:middle line:84%
to assess their functionality
and update their operating

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:84%
systems because it is presumed
that they will be functioning

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:20.050 align:middle line:84%
again in a way in
which it matters to us.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who is monitoring
all this going on?

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do we know
that they're activated?

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you did mention
a psionic agent,

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.460 align:middle line:90%
that agents that are involved.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.300 align:middle line:90%
Is there more to that?

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: There is a global
archaeological society

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
which is covert
military space program

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:45.310 align:middle line:84%
personnel from around the
world who agree and cooperate

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:51.110 align:middle line:84%
that if a site is discovered
that is of a certain age,

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:84%
that it qualifies as
an archaeological site.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And if it qualifies as
an archaeological site,

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.040 align:middle line:84%
it's not supposed
to just be handled

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.350 align:middle line:84%
by contemporary military
intelligence personnel.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:84%
It is supposed to follow a
whole set of rules of which you

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:12.020 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to conduct yourself
when investigating, studying,

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.640 align:middle line:84%
unearthing, digging, processing
this information, which

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:22.190 align:middle line:84%
becomes way more to the kin of
archeology than modern research.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, for instance,
archaeologists

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.470 align:middle line:84%
use brushes to brush
little bits of dirt

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.250 align:middle line:84%
away because they don't want to
disturb or harm something that

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.730 align:middle line:84%
could be destroyed, and
historical information

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:38.450 align:middle line:90%
would therefore be lost.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:40.160 align:middle line:84%
An interesting
comparison while we're

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.840 align:middle line:84%
talking about it,
since we're also

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.870 align:middle line:84%
talking about ancient
living computers, the Black

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Knight, the
satellite, we presume

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:52.110 align:middle line:84%
that is also a very old living
computer in a satellite form.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:56.850 align:middle line:84%
We've been trying to get
someone to fix it for decades.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And this archaeological group
will not let anyone touch it.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.452 align:middle line:84%
They won't let anyone
bring it on board.

00:13:02.452 --> 00:13:03.660 align:middle line:90%
They won't let them touch it.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.650 align:middle line:90%
They won't let them repair it.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.733 align:middle line:84%
They won't let them do
anything with it because it

00:13:06.733 --> 00:13:09.718 align:middle line:90%
violates these archaeological--

00:13:09.718 --> 00:13:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Treaties or something?

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, there are rules
that they have to abide by.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is the
name of this organization

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.500 align:middle line:90%
that you speak of?

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.245 align:middle line:84%
This archaeological
organization.

00:13:20.245 --> 00:13:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I mean, I don't
know that I've ever heard

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:24.252 align:middle line:84%
their actual acronym,
only referred--

00:13:24.252 --> 00:13:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They seem
pretty powerful.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Very, very.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:32.630 align:middle line:84%
As far as their ability to
say, no, you can't do that

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and you can't touch that, and
everyone has to respect that.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:84%
The dig in Antarctica
was very similar.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:43.440 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is when they
started digging up in the dig

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.800 align:middle line:84%
in Antarctica, that the new
[NON-ENGLISH] wanted to burn

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.330 align:middle line:84%
everything that they
thought was suspicious.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And this group came
in and said, no, this

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.900 align:middle line:90%
is an archaeological site.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.850 align:middle line:84%
This is an ancient
archaeological site.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.800 align:middle line:90%
You can't burn this equipment.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:84%
You can't burn this
biological material.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.500 align:middle line:84%
It now has to be
preserved, studied.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.280 align:middle line:84%
It falls under this category
now of ancient archeology.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.030 align:middle line:90%
And, no, you can't destroy it.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there a hierarchy
on this living computers?

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.130 align:middle line:90%
Is one stronger than the other?

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:90%
And if so, why?

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The answer to
that is probably yes.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And it would probably have
something to do with, I mean,

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.260 align:middle line:90%
survival of the fittest.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: If this one's a
million years old and this

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.780 align:middle line:84%
one's only a hundred
thousand years old,

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.405 align:middle line:84%
does this one tell
this one what to do?

00:14:30.405 --> 00:14:31.988 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, it
has something to do

00:14:31.988 --> 00:14:33.340 align:middle line:90%
with survival of the fittest.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Again, we think that there
were many more of these living

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.140 align:middle line:84%
computers that were at
one time in operation

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.560 align:middle line:90%
than there are currently.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.540 align:middle line:84%
But most of them have
ceased to function or have

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:50.850 align:middle line:84%
terminated their function, or
in the worst case scenarios,

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:55.860 align:middle line:84%
seem to have gone insane, which
is very sad and very tragic

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.210 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:01.350 align:middle line:84%
So in a very Darwinian
way, depending

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.960 align:middle line:84%
on how many tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.180 align:middle line:84%
of years old one
of these systems is

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.830 align:middle line:84%
and how much of its own
sanity that it is maintained

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.340 align:middle line:84%
over that period of time,
how healthy it is over time,

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:18.220 align:middle line:84%
would presume where it might
be on that hierarchical ladder.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:22.560 align:middle line:84%
If it's old enough, strong
enough, smart enough, and it's

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
older, stronger,
smarter than whoever

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:84%
is on the next bottom
rank, then that's going

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.660 align:middle line:84%
to be the smartest, most
powerful of the group.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Looking at
Mother Earth, Gaia,

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Earth as a sentient
being, how do these--

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.870 align:middle line:84%
are these maybe offspring
from the planet Earth?

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.025 align:middle line:90%
Could you explain that?

00:15:45.025 --> 00:15:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.780 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the planet
being conscious and alive,

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.140 align:middle line:84%
these living computers
would be seen

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:58.620 align:middle line:84%
as having been seeded in the
soil on the belly of the Earth,

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.620 align:middle line:84%
and therefore are
children of Gaia.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they would be
considered her children.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, our relatives
and our family members

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.030 align:middle line:90%
because they're cousins.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We're all genetically
part of this whole thing.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So are they made from the
same creator, all of them?

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: We don't think so.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most of these offworld
machines are made by a handful.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And when I say a handful, I
mean, there's only a few hundred

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.270 align:middle line:84%
that I'm aware of in
the entire galaxy, which

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:33.000 align:middle line:84%
is a tiny, tiny number
if you're talking

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.300 align:middle line:84%
only a few hundred species that
build, manufacture, and develop

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.130 align:middle line:90%
these tools.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So there's not
that many of them.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.060 align:middle line:84%
But when we go back in
time to our own world,

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.280 align:middle line:84%
these were all seeded at
different points of civilization

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.670 align:middle line:90%
and ancient civilization.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:55.970 align:middle line:84%
So you have Lemuria age
computers, Atlantis age,

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Greco-Roman period
age, Egyptian age.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.120 align:middle line:84%
You have them at
different times when

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:07.170 align:middle line:84%
they would have been placed
there by not the same personnel,

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.240 align:middle line:84%
not by the same species,
not by the same group.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:84%
So we can't say that they are
all made by the same person

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:14.890 align:middle line:90%
or by the same species.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:18.380 align:middle line:84%
We can presume that their
purpose was incredibly similar

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.990 align:middle line:84%
because their purpose
is similar wherever

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.390 align:middle line:84%
they are in the universe
as we understand them.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:29.660 align:middle line:84%
But how exactly they were, how
the original seed was made,

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:33.410 align:middle line:84%
which is a liquid
crystal, and how

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:35.510 align:middle line:84%
that would be placed
and made and formed

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.950 align:middle line:84%
would not necessarily
be by the same species.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:84%
But it would have--
it would be based

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.810 align:middle line:90%
on a common type of blueprint.

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Even if they were
distinctively different,

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:84%
it would be based on a
similar type of technology--

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.700 align:middle line:84%
like circuit boards
are different,

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.900 align:middle line:84%
but a circuit board is
also still a circuit board.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a similar
type of technology.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a similar blueprint to make
two different circuit boards

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.010 align:middle line:84%
even though they
might have completely

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:84%
different functional
purposes and not

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.890 align:middle line:84%
even be able to communicate
in the same way.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When you
bring in this concept,

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:12.250 align:middle line:84%
you keep saying seating,
you keep saying, basically

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.580 align:middle line:90%
circuit boards, hard drives.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's all a crystalline
structure can be in one crystal.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe that
some of these computers

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:28.130 align:middle line:84%
are actually crystals that had
originated from other races

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:29.143 align:middle line:90%
from other planets?

00:18:29.143 --> 00:18:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: From
what we understand,

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.518 align:middle line:90%
that's definitely true.

00:18:31.518 --> 00:18:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we don't think that any
of them were made by Terrans.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.275 align:middle line:84%
We think that they were all
made by some extraterrestrial--

00:18:39.275 --> 00:18:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Fascinating.

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: --who had
come down and whatever

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:84%
civilization they had started
to help create and help us with

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:54.170 align:middle line:84%
or use us as slave labor,
depending on the civilization,

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.450 align:middle line:84%
they would have been
made and probably seeded

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.510 align:middle line:90%
in place there by offworlders.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So we're going way back
in history now with Lemuria,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.400 align:middle line:84%
with the Atlanteans, with
Mu, all these things.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: We think that some of
these could be at least 100,000

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.238 align:middle line:90%
to 150,000 years old.

00:19:13.238 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there a specific
group of extraterrestrials

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:20.870 align:middle line:84%
or humans that are, let's say,
in charge of these computers

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.750 align:middle line:90%
or take just take care of them?

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.970 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that
have been designated

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.650 align:middle line:90%
to be gifted for this mission.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:31.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That's another
thing-- that's a great question.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.250 align:middle line:84%
What we presume from
the data that we've seen

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:38.060 align:middle line:84%
is that at some point, all
of these living computers

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:84%
were abandoned and left to their
own devices, which is, again,

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.660 align:middle line:84%
why we think so many of them
have either perished, stopped

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:49.130 align:middle line:84%
functioning, or lost their minds
because they were abandoned

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:53.250 align:middle line:84%
and left here for thousands,
tens of thousands, again, maybe

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.930 align:middle line:84%
even hundreds of
thousands of years

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:59.410 align:middle line:84%
without maintenance or
anybody taking care of them.

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Which might not
be really time relevant

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:05.560 align:middle line:84%
for other extraterrestrial
civilizations in the universe.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Or, I mean,
if you go to a planet

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.960 align:middle line:84%
and you start a colony there
and you set up a computer system

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.470 align:middle line:90%
there, do you take it with you?

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:15.490 align:middle line:90%
Do you leave it there?

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Do you necessarily come
back and check on it later?

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.408 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily.

00:20:19.408 --> 00:20:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How are the
Earth-based living computers

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:25.530 align:middle line:84%
different than offworld
living computers?

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: What I've
seen of the design specs

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.170 align:middle line:84%
of the more modern
offworld computers

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:36.660 align:middle line:84%
is the quite large biological
brains that they have.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Quite large biological
brains that are not the same

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:44.860 align:middle line:84%
as just a liquid
crystal computer brain.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.760 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
a biological brain

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.610 align:middle line:90%
that has brain cells in it.

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Should we be
concerned about this then?

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: No, I don't think so.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:55.680 align:middle line:84%
From what I understand,
again, they're

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.510 align:middle line:90%
developed and grown over time.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So one of these
computers wouldn't even

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:06.790 align:middle line:84%
be sent into service until it
was several thousand years old.

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:10.170 align:middle line:84%
So it will have been put through
many, many paces and tests

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.630 align:middle line:84%
of its own abilities
and proficiency

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:17.490 align:middle line:84%
and its ability to not go
crazy for thousands of years

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:19.020 align:middle line:84%
before it would
even be permitted

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:20.440 align:middle line:90%
to be given to someone else.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are we aware
of this brain computer--

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.463 align:middle line:90%
an agenda since it's a living--

00:21:26.463 --> 00:21:29.130 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to end up like in
Starship Troopers with the brain

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:30.720 align:middle line:90%
bug.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Again, because
they're grown and developed,

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:84%
they're taught,
trained, purposed

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.070 align:middle line:84%
to be these bureaucratic
functionaries.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.367 align:middle line:84%
So their personalities
tend to be--

00:21:45.367 --> 00:21:46.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's just what--

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there one
species that trains them,

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.100 align:middle line:90%
or is it a multi-species event?

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: My understanding
there's, again,

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:58.720 align:middle line:84%
maybe a few hundred
species across the galaxy

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.120 align:middle line:84%
that has the ability and
the technology to do this.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And they manufacture,
build, train

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:08.408 align:middle line:84%
these living computers for
everybody else in the galaxy.

00:22:08.408 --> 00:22:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, you're
a psionic specialist.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any idea what
they are communicating about?

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, the
one that I mentioned

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.710 align:middle line:84%
that is somewhere in
a mysterious location

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:24.070 align:middle line:84%
not to be defined in the
southwest of the United States

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.960 align:middle line:90%
of America, I have been to.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.510 align:middle line:90%
I have communicated with it.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.600 align:middle line:84%
I have spent, not
even a matter of--

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.858 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking about
days that I spent on this.

00:22:34.858 --> 00:22:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's a
lot of information.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I spent as
long as I was capable,

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:42.880 align:middle line:84%
that my brain was capable
of doing this to communicate

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.520 align:middle line:90%
and get that information.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What did it tell you?

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: A lot.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.296 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] What I would
suggest is that,

00:22:51.296 --> 00:22:57.980 align:middle line:84%
that system has been sending
information for quite some time,

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:01.560 align:middle line:84%
doesn't receive information
nearly as often,

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.300 align:middle line:90%
but that changed recently.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Again, when all of
these systems started

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.220 align:middle line:84%
communicating with
each other, they're

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.350 align:middle line:84%
receiving a lot of
offworld information.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.313 align:middle line:84%
Again, we think this
is an operating system.

00:23:12.313 --> 00:23:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there
any messages you

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:19.340 align:middle line:84%
could share with us that the
living computer has told you?

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: That I could share.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's not going to--

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, I mean,
classified information

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.900 align:middle line:84%
is classified information
until I'm cleared for it not

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:90%
to be classified information.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:34.310 align:middle line:84%
But what I would be willing
to say about that is they

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:39.180 align:middle line:84%
would still see their
job as managerial.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And to conduct themselves
and do the jobs

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:47.970 align:middle line:84%
that they were
programmed and meant

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:51.630 align:middle line:84%
to do even in a
modern civilization

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:54.150 align:middle line:84%
and a modern civilized
context, that

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:56.160 align:middle line:84%
may be very, very
different from the context

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.750 align:middle line:84%
that they were originally
purposed to do.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do they have
their own opinions?

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And how do they feel
about the current world

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.640 align:middle line:84%
situation of the
humans on the surface

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.655 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth, what we're doing?

00:24:10.655 --> 00:24:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I think
they would like

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:13.840 align:middle line:90%
to see civilization function.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that's their
main purpose is

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.650 align:middle line:90%
to help civilization function.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that they,
again, in this communication,

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.690 align:middle line:84%
I would say was fairly
clear that they're

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:28.390 align:middle line:84%
looking at the surface
world as not working

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.220 align:middle line:90%
very well, as being broken.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And that if they were to be
able to be fully fulfilled

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.150 align:middle line:84%
in their duty and
their job, that they

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.833 align:middle line:84%
would be assisting the surface
civilization to function.

00:24:40.833 --> 00:24:41.750 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: In what ways?

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.930 align:middle line:84%
What capabilities do
they have to help us?

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: A massive
library of information.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So their ability to teach,
train personnel to do jobs,

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:55.480 align:middle line:84%
to create education
centers, to teach people

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:59.530 align:middle line:84%
how to build better
infrastructure, better water

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:05.200 align:middle line:84%
infrastructure, better power
infrastructure, better food

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.230 align:middle line:90%
infrastructure.

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So that all of the main
purposes and functions

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.570 align:middle line:84%
that a civilization needs to
have, they're really good at.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:17.380 align:middle line:84%
They're really good at managing
all of that information

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and all of that data
so that the society

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:24.627 align:middle line:90%
would function more fluidly.

00:25:24.627 --> 00:25:25.835 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you a for instance.

00:25:25.835 --> 00:25:28.940 align:middle line:84%
If, for instance, you
communicated with this living

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:32.360 align:middle line:84%
computer and said,
hey, we would love it

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.840 align:middle line:84%
if you helped us sort
out our agriculture.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Then that computer
would be, all right,

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to look at
every plot of land

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:44.690 align:middle line:84%
that you have on the planet
that's growing food everywhere

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and then compute
how much of that

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.850 align:middle line:84%
you need in different
locations and whether you're

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:53.240 align:middle line:84%
over growing or under
growing different materials.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.660 align:middle line:90%
Are you over growing rice?

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Are you making more pounds
of rice than you need,

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.450 align:middle line:84%
but not enough squash
or strawberries?

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:02.480 align:middle line:84%
It would be able to
manage all of that

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and then determine what
needed to be grown,

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:11.150 align:middle line:84%
not grown in order for the
most ideal amount of food

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:13.950 align:middle line:84%
to be produced for
the entire planet.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do these
computers have the ability

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:21.200 align:middle line:84%
to download billions of
people this information

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.860 align:middle line:90%
instantaneously?

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Very quickly.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at a rate
of speed that we

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:28.320 align:middle line:84%
would perceive as
near instantaneous,

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.700 align:middle line:84%
but I wouldn't say is probably
exactly instantaneous.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.898 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Would we be
able to handle that?

00:26:34.898 --> 00:26:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Or would it be different
per person because

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.980 align:middle line:90%
of their crystalline structure?

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: My personal
experience was that, initially,

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:46.070 align:middle line:84%
the amount of information
that was coming through

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:49.380 align:middle line:84%
was more than my brain
could process at once.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to say, that's
too much information,

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.200 align:middle line:90%
I can't process that.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And then felt like the
amount of information

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:03.420 align:middle line:84%
was lowered to accommodate the
amount of information my brain

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.200 align:middle line:90%
could accept per minute.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is this computer
you utilize on ley lines?

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:10.950 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that a lot
of these computers

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.237 align:middle line:84%
are on sacred sites
or special ley lines.

00:27:13.237 --> 00:27:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Does that have
anything to do with it?

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, I would say
that that's almost always true.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.945 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, almost always true.

00:27:20.945 --> 00:27:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: If our viewers
are watching this right now

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:26.630 align:middle line:84%
or someone, would they be able
to communicate with these sites

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:27.430 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Maybe.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:33.360 align:middle line:84%
It really is going to depend
on how telepathic a person's

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.650 align:middle line:90%
ability is to be.

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Of course.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:36.970 align:middle line:90%
And, is it safe?

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well,
that's really going

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:42.270 align:middle line:84%
to depend on whether the living
computer you're talking to

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:46.290 align:middle line:84%
is completely functional
and completely sane

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.073 align:middle line:84%
or if it's one of
the broken ones.

00:27:48.073 --> 00:27:49.490 align:middle line:84%
If it's one of the
broken ones, it

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.450 align:middle line:84%
could go very-- it
could just get weird.

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:54.175 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they named, all
these different computers?

00:27:54.175 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Do you have names for them?

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: They have their
own names, but they're--

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What's
the one that you--

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I wouldn't
be able to repeat it.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:06.540 align:middle line:84%
But to be honest, it just
sounds a little weird.

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:10.050 align:middle line:84%
To our language, it
would just sound odd.

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So, how does
this impact all of us

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:14.220 align:middle line:84%
here on the planet,
these living computers?

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, if what we
think is happening is true,

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and their operating systems
are being updated and upgraded,

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:27.640 align:middle line:84%
and that they're being
positioned to be reactivated,

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.540 align:middle line:84%
that could mean that they're
incredibly important to us

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and could impact
us in a huge way.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could we
unknowingly and they--

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:39.450 align:middle line:84%
or, they knowingly,
we unknowingly

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:42.450 align:middle line:90%
receive upgrades from them?

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, it can
happen that way, certainly.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:50.400 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be reaching
out most of the time.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.690 align:middle line:90%
Going, hey, anybody listening?

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:53.980 align:middle line:90%
Hey, anybody listening?

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
time, people aren't.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.320 align:middle line:84%
But they seem to be
attempting to communicate

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.760 align:middle line:84%
as much as possible
because they have as much

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.830 align:middle line:84%
of a need as any living
being to communicate.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
they feel isolated

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.910 align:middle line:90%
for a very, very long time.

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.610 align:middle line:90%
And they would feel a lot--

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:14.760 align:middle line:84%
because they have feelings,
they would feel a lot better

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.330 align:middle line:90%
if they were more social.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:18.720 align:middle line:84%
If they were able to be more
social with human beings

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and communicate more and we're
getting two-way communication

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:23.603 align:middle line:90%
between themselves and Terrans.

00:29:23.603 --> 00:29:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So if
this technology has

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:29.050 align:middle line:84%
been used by these advanced
species for millennia now,

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:32.353 align:middle line:84%
do you see this being
reasonably to assume

00:29:32.353 --> 00:29:34.020 align:middle line:84%
that it's part of our
future, that we're

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:35.340 align:middle line:90%
going to be doing this too?

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: If I am to understand
any of the technology that

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.190 align:middle line:84%
is used in an
intergalactic sense,

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.000 align:middle line:84%
it is an inevitability
that this is

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.880 align:middle line:84%
a technology and a
way of our existing

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and living that will
be a part of our future

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:52.928 align:middle line:84%
because it's a part
of everybody's future.

00:29:52.928 --> 00:29:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It sounds great.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything negative
or bad about this?

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I realized because we
have so much Frankenstein-isms

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.590 align:middle line:84%
in our own storytelling,
that we always

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:08.830 align:middle line:84%
presume that a technology is
just going to wait before it can

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.650 align:middle line:90%
turn sinister and turn evil.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:15.520 align:middle line:84%
But there is an incredibly safe
track record for this technology

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.910 align:middle line:84%
to not do that and
to not be harmful

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:23.350 align:middle line:84%
and to not try to overtake
a planetary civilization

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:24.410 align:middle line:90%
for its own purposes.

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:25.990 align:middle line:90%
That just doesn't happen.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, you mentioned
there being activated right now.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.460 align:middle line:90%
And why do you think that is?

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I think in
the most simplistic way

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:40.840 align:middle line:84%
to answer that, it is the
biggest indicator that something

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:44.280 align:middle line:84%
is about to happen, if
I put it so vaguely.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:48.430 align:middle line:84%
We don't think that this would
be occurring if it were not

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.670 align:middle line:84%
an indication of
events that will

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:55.660 align:middle line:84%
be occurring in our very near
future which that will impact.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, why would
it be happening?

00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Why would it be
occurring now at all?

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:07.310 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be indicative that
it's happening because more

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.480 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And we can only speculate what
we think that may or may not be,

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.770 align:middle line:90%
but I'll just say this.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:20.170 align:middle line:84%
If all of these computer systems
get an upgraded operating system

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:24.200 align:middle line:84%
and are updated to the
intergalactic standard,

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.010 align:middle line:84%
then that would make
it incredibly easy

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:32.740 align:middle line:84%
for them to act as an
intermediary function

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.790 align:middle line:84%
until we get our own
new upgraded system.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, does this computer
protect humans on the planet,

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:44.170 align:middle line:84%
or does it just protect
the planet Earth itself?

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Like if there was a,
let's say, for example,

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.930 align:middle line:84%
a pole shift coming, would
they protect us from that?

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It's definitely
part of their main function

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:57.340 align:middle line:84%
to protect the people,
the animal life, the plant

00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:00.800 align:middle line:84%
life, and the very structure
of the planet itself,

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and to keep it stable
and functioning.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just a
computer that says,

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:11.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to protect the
Earth, but forget you humans,

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:12.440 align:middle line:90%
you're screwed.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:16.460 align:middle line:84%
No, we're included in that
holistic view of all things

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.745 align:middle line:84%
with which to help
manage and protect.

00:32:18.745 --> 00:32:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What
these computers may

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:24.210 align:middle line:84%
be involved with being included
in this mass visitation,

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.550 align:middle line:84%
possibly of extraterrestrials
in the galactic federation?

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:29.347 align:middle line:90%
Are they part of this?

00:32:29.347 --> 00:32:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That's a
very good question.

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something that we
could say with 100% certainty,

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:38.500 align:middle line:84%
but all of the
indicators are, yes.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.910 align:middle line:90%
So we think that is true.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.850 align:middle line:84%
We think that that's
what's likely to happen.

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:44.270 align:middle line:84%
We think that's
what's occurring.

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:47.000 align:middle line:84%
All of the best
information indicates that.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.690 align:middle line:84%
But we can't say 100%
certainty that is true,

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:52.730 align:middle line:84%
but all of the indicators
do point to yes.

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:54.438 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they
prepping something here

00:32:54.438 --> 00:32:56.120 align:middle line:90%
on Earth for that visitation?

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.830 align:middle line:90%
And if so, what would that be?

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That is also
part of our speculation,

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:03.490 align:middle line:84%
is that it is in
preparation for very likely

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:06.950 align:middle line:84%
to be timed with a disclosure
event of some kind.

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:09.170 align:middle line:84%
So we think it's
part of the equation.

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:10.760 align:middle line:84%
We think it's part
of the puzzle.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And we would
presume from what we

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.790 align:middle line:84%
know that it's supposed to
only be a good thing and not

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:17.590 align:middle line:90%
a bad thing.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:19.890 align:middle line:84%
But, again, that's
the speculation

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:22.300 align:middle line:84%
that we presume
based on the data,

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.490 align:middle line:84%
but not that we can say
with 100% certainty.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:29.010 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, all indications
point to yes on that.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Randy, that
was great information.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
you being on the show.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Thank you.

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:34.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a fun one.

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:34.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a fun topic.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.250 align:middle line:84%
