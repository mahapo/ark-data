>> EMERY SMITH: Today,
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.050 align:middle line:10%
we are with John Ramirez,
a retired CIA officer,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.380 align:middle line:10%
who served as chief of the
Electronic Intelligence branch

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.170 align:middle line:10%
and specialized in
ballistic missile defense,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.090 align:middle line:10%
weapon systems radar,
and technical collection

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.890 align:middle line:10%
operations.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Today, he shares his
experiences with hybrids.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.395 align:middle line:90%
John, welcome to the show.

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN RAMIREZ:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let's
talk about hybrids.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.527 align:middle line:84%
From your own understanding,
what is a hybrid?

00:00:45.527 --> 00:00:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: Well,
generically, a hybrid

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.480 align:middle line:84%
is a combination of two other
species to make a new species.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And in our context, where
we're talking about today,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.320 align:middle line:84%
it's a human with a
nonhuman intelligence.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So for my understanding
of hybrids,

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.240 align:middle line:84%
it's a mixture of
human and nonhuman DNA.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.940 align:middle line:10%
In some aspects, we humans are
already hybrids in the sense

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.150 align:middle line:10%
that we may have been
accelerated in our development.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.050 align:middle line:10%
If we do have close
cousins, the primates,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.170 align:middle line:10%
we're very different from
primates, very different

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.200 align:middle line:10%
from any primate you
see in the wild or one

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.970 align:middle line:10%
you may visit in a zoo.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And in that regard, what I
call an alien hybrid, which

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.100 align:middle line:90%
is a very bad term to use.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Just not very descriptive.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.870 align:middle line:84%
I would go back to
nonhuman intelligence.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.440 align:middle line:10%
They could have helped
us in our development,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.180 align:middle line:10%
and they could have helped
us to become more accelerated

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.940 align:middle line:10%
than what we would normally
would have achieved

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.700 align:middle line:10%
through natural evolution.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, we are,
ourselves, hybrids.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:10%
But they, themselves,
may also be

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.380 align:middle line:10%
hybrids from other interventions
by other beings who

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.090 align:middle line:10%
made them what they were.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.729 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What ETs have
hybridization programs

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.699 align:middle line:90%
with humans?

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.300 align:middle line:10%
>>RAMIREZ: I don't know
exactly which ones.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.220 align:middle line:10%
I can only relate to my
own personal experience.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.400 align:middle line:10%
My personal experience
is that I was

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.350 align:middle line:10%
taken by beings
who self-identified

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.880 align:middle line:10%
as Saurian, in the
sense that they're not

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.340 align:middle line:10%
reptiles or lizard
people, but their ancestry

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.480 align:middle line:10%
came from something what we
would describe as reptiles.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.340 align:middle line:10%
So for me, my interactions
have been with Saurians.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.300 align:middle line:10%
And I think that they had an
interest in my development.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Whether they intervened in
a certain way, I don't know.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.600 align:middle line:84%
But again I've had
an interest in space.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.340 align:middle line:10%
I've had an interest
in this entire topic

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:10%
from a very young age.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.570 align:middle line:10%
And I've had all these other
experiences with these beings.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:10%
So I assume that my experience
is with Saurians in helping

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.650 align:middle line:10%
me become the individual I am.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In what way did
they interact with you

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.520 align:middle line:90%
and communicate?

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: Yes,
it's all telepathic.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:90%
I remember that.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.080 align:middle line:84%
If there's any kind of
intervention physically,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.820 align:middle line:84%
it would have
occurred in the story

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I told about being a
young child and being

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.550 align:middle line:84%
taken to that Victorian house
and being medically examined.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.520 align:middle line:10%
I have no memory of
anything happening to me

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.730 align:middle line:10%
other than examination, but
that was an opportunity.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.010 align:middle line:10%
And also being taken
aboard a craft,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:10%
that was another
opportunity, as well,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.360 align:middle line:10%
to have some kind of direct
intervention with me.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.420 align:middle line:90%
I believe I do have an implant.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.670 align:middle line:10%
I've been told I have
an implant by people

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.180 align:middle line:10%
who do not know each other
and did not know me at all.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.070 align:middle line:10%
And these are
lightworkers, people

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.350 align:middle line:10%
we call lightworkers
or clairvoyants

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.920 align:middle line:10%
or people who are very tuned
in to higher consciousness.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.260 align:middle line:10%
And they told me
individually that they

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.240 align:middle line:10%
could hear my implant.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.640 align:middle line:10%
And one woman said
that your implant

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.010 align:middle line:10%
is giving me a headache.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.070 align:middle line:10%
So I know the
existence of implants

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.589 align:middle line:10%
is controversial,
because it assumes

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:26.570 align:middle line:10%
that part of that hybridization
is control, mind control.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:10%
I don't think it's
mind control so

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.060 align:middle line:10%
much as behavior modification
of being more open.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:84%
It opens up channels to
have these experiences

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.770 align:middle line:84%
and maybe perhaps there's
something different about me

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.190 align:middle line:84%
physiologically that my
mind or my brain, rather,

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.080 align:middle line:84%
my physical organic brain
acts like an antenna

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.342 align:middle line:90%
for their messages.

00:04:51.342 --> 00:04:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's been a
lot of talk about that

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.920 align:middle line:84%
in scientific circles
as well, that there's

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.890 align:middle line:84%
some part of the brain
called the caudate putamen

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:84%
that may act like an antenna and
that certain individuals have

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:84%
very pronounced, very
active caudate putamen.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.100 align:middle line:84%
I hear rumors about it, but
I can't substantiate it.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And the people who know aren't
going to say anything about it.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.830 align:middle line:90%
But again, it's out there.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's out there,
and it's anecdotal.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any evidence
for it, and I can't prove it.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But I think it needs
to be said that there

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.070 align:middle line:84%
is a scientific
effort to study that.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: For what purpose is
the hybridization program?

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Maybe what you're
talking about right now,

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.470 align:middle line:84%
there is a purpose for
that, you said behavioral.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.530 align:middle line:84%
What other purposes do you
think the extraterrestrials

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.395 align:middle line:90%
have hybridization programs?

00:05:44.395 --> 00:05:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: Well, first of
all, to be aware of them.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.250 align:middle line:84%
To be aware of them, perhaps,
a little more strongly

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.960 align:middle line:90%
than the general population.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
people who have seen

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.390 align:middle line:84%
these orbs or have had
encounters with craft,

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.210 align:middle line:84%
but they have not
received any messages.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.290 align:middle line:84%
They didn't get any
profound messages that

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.270 align:middle line:90%
profoundly changed their lives.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And in other cases,
just seeing one

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.592 align:middle line:84%
completely changed
their perspective.

00:06:14.592 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That could be
the message itself, just

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.080 align:middle line:90%
by visualization.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.570 align:middle line:10%
>>RAMIREZ: That could be,
but they're out there now.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And many of the podcasters that
people out there might know,

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.700 align:middle line:90%
they're actually experiencers.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.070 align:middle line:90%
They don't say it, perhaps.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.680 align:middle line:10%
They don't say it
as loudly, but there

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.330 align:middle line:10%
are experiencers out there.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are those who ended
up in careers in the government

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and the intelligence community
that were experiencers

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:90%
before they arrived.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:10%
And for me, personally,
I can say this

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.820 align:middle line:10%
because it's a
personal experience.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.040 align:middle line:10%
It all led up to what
we're doing right now,

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.730 align:middle line:10%
talking to you and to your
audience, sharing what I know.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.210 align:middle line:10%
And I just want to assure
people that they're not crazy.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.150 align:middle line:10%
They may have no
one else to talk to.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.390 align:middle line:10%
They may be afraid to talk
to their friends and family,

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:07.520 align:middle line:10%
certainly not coworkers for
fear of derision, ridicule.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.130 align:middle line:10%
But I want them to know
that what they experience

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.460 align:middle line:10%
is genuine, and they
shouldn't be afraid.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.910 align:middle line:90%
And they're not the only ones.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.720 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many,
many, more out there.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They shouldn't
be judged for that.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>RAMIREZ: No, they shouldn't.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Those are
real experiences.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: Yes they're
very real experiences.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.230 align:middle line:10%
And others who actually
work in government,

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.530 align:middle line:10%
who not only had the
experience personally but had

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.420 align:middle line:10%
direct encounters
professionally,

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.500 align:middle line:10%
that they know that
hybrids do exist.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.730 align:middle line:10%
That it's a real thing.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.430 align:middle line:10%
They know that
implants are real.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a real thing.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.460 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
they're not allowed

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.660 align:middle line:90%
to talk about it at all.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason why
I'm talking about it

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.030 align:middle line:84%
is because I'm not
a whistleblower.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.740 align:middle line:90%
I want to make that plain.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.470 align:middle line:84%
I never was a
whistleblower from day one.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:84%
I went to the CIA, and
I wrote them a letter,

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.410 align:middle line:84%
saying this is what I'm
going to talk about.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.770 align:middle line:10%
And I listed everything I knew
about everything, including

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:05.570 align:middle line:10%
that meeting.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.370 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Good.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.720 align:middle line:10%
>>RAMIREZ: And I said, if you
have any problems with it,

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.800 align:middle line:10%
you know how to reach me.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:10%
You know how to contact me.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.490 align:middle line:10%
Tell me to stop.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.950 align:middle line:10%
Tell me if there's any
problems with anything

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.830 align:middle line:10%
I say, and I will
absolutely stop.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I don't like
that term "whistleblower."

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.948 align:middle line:84%
People called me that
at the beginning,

00:08:23.948 --> 00:08:25.490 align:middle line:84%
when I started
releasing information.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.970 align:middle line:90%
I just told my story.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.955 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't in the
project at that time.

00:08:29.955 --> 00:08:31.160 align:middle line:90%
I already left.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.809 align:middle line:90%
But I did like what you did.

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:33.919 align:middle line:90%
You made an announcement.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.250 align:middle line:84%
You talked to your
people, and said, hey,

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:90%
this is what's going on.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I think people need to
know that people like us

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.820 align:middle line:84%
and them, the viewers that
are in these positions,

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.330 align:middle line:84%
can do that and feel a
little bit more comfortable

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.590 align:middle line:90%
moving forward.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: Yeah,
even more so now.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.160 align:middle line:84%
When WPA got signed into law,
that it's now part of law.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's not-- before,
it was a stigma, not sharing.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And now, you're
encouraged to share.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.160 align:middle line:84%
That if you don't share,
then there's the stigma

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.720 align:middle line:90%
of what are you hiding?

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:11.128 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, that whole process
got reversed in a good way.

00:09:11.128 --> 00:09:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And we're going toward
the right direction.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:13.550 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.925 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: So I'm
looking forward

00:09:14.925 --> 00:09:17.760 align:middle line:84%
to the next hearing,
public hearing.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.520 align:middle line:90%
I understand there will be one.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm also looking forward
to the unclassified report.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:28.520 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is that it's on
Secretary Austin, the Secretary

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.050 align:middle line:90%
of Defense's desk.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And I said that in
my other interviews,

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.990 align:middle line:84%
that I know it's at
the secretary's desk,

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and that there's probably some
talk about what can be released

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.820 align:middle line:90%
and what can't be released.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the intelligence
community, civilian side,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.180 align:middle line:84%
is more willing to
release information,

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.490 align:middle line:84%
whereas the Department
of Defense side

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.990 align:middle line:90%
is reluctant to do so.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And I believe they're
having negotiations

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.560 align:middle line:90%
on what to release.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.900 align:middle line:84%
We have to be protective,
to an extent, of course.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: Yes, and there
will be unclassified version.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:07.720 align:middle line:84%
But for members of Congress
with oversight authorities,

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.510 align:middle line:84%
they have to release everything
that Congress asks for.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hoping for a more
meaningful hearing next time.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You've talked about DNA
influences on the human body,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.210 align:middle line:84%
especially with
extraterrestrials

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.170 align:middle line:90%
and hybridization.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.600 align:middle line:84%
You, yourself, talked
about the Saurians

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and how you have an
affinity for that.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.910 align:middle line:84%
With all the different species
that are out there mentioned,

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.460 align:middle line:84%
that not only you have mentioned
but others and individuals

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.330 align:middle line:84%
out there have mentioned, with
the hybridization program,

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.590 align:middle line:84%
why wouldn't we look more
different than as we all

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.570 align:middle line:90%
look the same, as a human?

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: Well,
one of the beings

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:84%
that people report
seeing are the very tall,

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.600 align:middle line:90%
human-like beings.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And I, personally, believe
that we are from them.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.450 align:middle line:84%
That we are actually
offspring of them,

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.100 align:middle line:90%
and that we were brought here.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And that we forgot our
reason why we're here.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And we try to make
these connections

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.660 align:middle line:90%
in our past history.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.390 align:middle line:84%
That we build these
monuments to the heavens,

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.595 align:middle line:84%
and we have these
wonderful stories

00:11:13.595 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:90%
of the gods living in the air.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.870 align:middle line:84%
We have this concept of
heaven, of a divine being,

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.360 align:middle line:90%
not on Earth but above us.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Where did all that come from,
angels and messengers of God?

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:31.160 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we
forgot our true origins.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And that, it's not that
we don't look like them.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:40.130 align:middle line:84%
We are them, and they look like
us because we look like them.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:41.400 align:middle line:90%
We are them.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the hybridization
is not necessarily

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:47.970 align:middle line:84%
changing our appearance
but more like expanding

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:52.770 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness, of
elevating consciousness

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and expanding human potential
to be all that we can be

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:03.600 align:middle line:84%
and that we're just using just a
small portion of our abilities.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.610 align:middle line:84%
That the human brain is
capable of so much more

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:12.050 align:middle line:84%
and that our five senses tend
to block us of what we can see.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Our eyes are limited to
a very narrow spectrum,

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and our ears are even
more so very narrow.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, our skin is much more
sensitive to more frequencies

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.130 align:middle line:90%
than our own eyes.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.640 align:middle line:84%
That we can actually feel
wavelengths that our eyes

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.720 align:middle line:90%
cannot see.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.960 align:middle line:84%
That is the part
of the story there,

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:39.680 align:middle line:84%
that we are somehow limited and
that the hybridization is not

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:84%
to further limit us
but to expand us,

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.560 align:middle line:84%
to make us more aware
of our consciousness.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And some people
do it chemically,

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.100 align:middle line:90%
and that's one way of doing it.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Some people do it
through meditation.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.130 align:middle line:84%
That's what I do, a
deep, mindful meditation

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.730 align:middle line:84%
taught to me by my
own lightworker.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And she's been very wonderful
in teaching me this,

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:07.580 align:middle line:84%
and it has really enriched my
life to follow her protocols.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.340 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what I believe.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.020 align:middle line:84%
That it's not necessarily that
we need to look like Saurians.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Correct.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I don't
believe that either.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of
the hybridization

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.510 align:middle line:84%
programs and hybrids out
there, especially mostly,

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.450 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of
human extraterrestrials.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.020 align:middle line:84%
But as the old saying is, we
all look the same on the inside,

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.580 align:middle line:90%
I have to disagree with.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Because there are a lot
of different physicality,

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:37.700 align:middle line:84%
not only just physical, but
also frequency-derived cells

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.865 align:middle line:84%
in the body that are not
in everyone, I'll say.

00:13:40.865 --> 00:13:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
something really important

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.200 align:middle line:84%
that you mentioned is
that it has nothing

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.170 align:middle line:84%
to do with also
the look of someone

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.660 align:middle line:84%
just because you cross
this being with this being,

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.870 align:middle line:84%
but more of what's the
accelerating consciousness

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.820 align:middle line:90%
of that being because of that?

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: Yes, and
again, consciousness

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.940 align:middle line:84%
is the very important
aspect of this.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's one that, I
believe, the government just

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.440 align:middle line:90%
recently learned about.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.610 align:middle line:84%
That when the orbs appeared,
it was no longer metallic

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.440 align:middle line:90%
structured craft.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.700 align:middle line:84%
That they became aware
people seeing these orbs,

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.370 align:middle line:84%
having encounters,
have these experiences

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.800 align:middle line:90%
where it changes their lives.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's been reported.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I would
suggest that people

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.950 align:middle line:84%
don't think the
government is not

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:32.200 align:middle line:84%
aware of what is said in social
media of all the websites

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.080 align:middle line:84%
that the experiencers have
published, channelers, as well.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I believe they're well
aware of what channelers

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:43.870 align:middle line:84%
have said in their messages and
what experiencers have related.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And some of us, who
are experiencers,

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
have been in government and
we're using that platform

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.670 align:middle line:84%
to help, not only the
government understand

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.620 align:middle line:84%
that this is what's
going on, but help

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.320 align:middle line:84%
our fellow human beings
understand that they shouldn't

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.190 align:middle line:90%
feel stigmatized about this.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Do all ETs have the same
purpose for their hybridization

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.240 align:middle line:90%
programs?

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: I'm not aware
if all ETs or all nonhuman

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.280 align:middle line:84%
intelligence have
hybridization programs.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.640 align:middle line:84%
I've never been
made aware of that.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I just know that officially
in that briefing,

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:24.550 align:middle line:90%
it was labeled "alien."

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: All right.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: They did not
specify what kind of alien.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, have you
ever encountered someone

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.020 align:middle line:90%
that you thought was a hybrid?

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RAMIREZ: Yes.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there are people
I've met that, to me, felt

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.640 align:middle line:90%
like they're not 100% human.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.740 align:middle line:90%
And some I've met at CIA.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Some I met just in
ordinary, everyday life.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:49.830 align:middle line:84%
You just get this feeling that
you come in contact with them,

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:51.840 align:middle line:84%
and you know that
they're special.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Especially, with me, personally,
if I walk into a room,

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.020 align:middle line:84%
I can tell who the
lightworkers are.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Because I can feel the
energy radiating from them,

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.590 align:middle line:90%
and I react with that energy.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And I really like that
feeling of that energy

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.260 align:middle line:90%
that they emanate.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a good, friendly,
very strong, very vibrant,

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.960 align:middle line:90%
positive energy.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, and you go into
a room and all of a sudden,

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.910 align:middle line:84%
you just feel like
that person is someone

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:90%
you don't want to be with.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.560 align:middle line:84%
They're just
resonating differently,

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:90%
and it's more like resonance.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.062 align:middle line:84%
Like we need to find
our natural resonance.

00:16:30.062 --> 00:16:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And you could do that
through meditation,

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:34.050 align:middle line:84%
but once you find your
natural resonance,

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:37.320 align:middle line:84%
it's like tuning in a radio,
because right now, there

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.450 align:middle line:84%
are all kinds of
broadcast frequencies,

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:42.450 align:middle line:84%
but you can only listen
to one at a time.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, with
this type of energy,

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.920 align:middle line:84%
you need to tune into
what your resonance is

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and then that's where
you hear the messages.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.742 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, it's just noise.

00:16:54.742 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How did your
hybridization come about?

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Is that one of the ways
that you found out?

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.300 align:middle line:90%
Through the frequency?

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RAMIREZ: Through mine?

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.380 align:middle line:84%
My personal hybridization
is mostly my interpretation

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.630 align:middle line:84%
of the experiences
that I had of being

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:84%
taken, of being
taken aboard a craft

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.510 align:middle line:84%
and having lightworkers tell
me that you're a hybrid.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.810 align:middle line:90%
You have an implant.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And my only
professional experience

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:24.599 align:middle line:84%
was the one where I had
a nosebleed at work,

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and I reached for
a box of tissues.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And my chair was an
office chair with wheels.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And I rolled back and
landed flat on my back.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.500 align:middle line:84%
They took me up to the
Office of Medical Services,

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.780 align:middle line:84%
where I was examined
by a doctor.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor wanted to take
X-rays since I fell on my back.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:41.580 align:middle line:90%
They took X-rays.

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at the
X-ray and asked me

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:48.180 align:middle line:84%
if I ever had any
major surgery or was I

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.090 align:middle line:90%
ever in a very bad accident?

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:52.830 align:middle line:90%
No to both.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And then he got another
doctor to look at it.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, hmm, this
is very interesting.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And it looked to them like
I've had surgery, somehow,

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:02.910 align:middle line:90%
and I never did.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
addressed the nosebleed.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.690 align:middle line:84%
So when they addressed
the nosebleed,

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.150 align:middle line:84%
they peered into
my right nostril.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And the one doctor
said, have you ever

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:17.570 align:middle line:84%
had any kind of major surgery
in your right nostril, deep?

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:18.390 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:19.190 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:24.970 align:middle line:84%
Because, he said, there is
a surgical precision cut.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:28.600 align:middle line:84%
A surgeon cut into your
right nostril, which

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:90%
is the source of the bleeding.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.530 align:middle line:90%
And then he got another doctor.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:35.410 align:middle line:84%
The same doctor that
looked at my X-rays.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And they looked at
it, and he pretty much

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.750 align:middle line:84%
agreed with that
first assessment.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:43.060 align:middle line:90%
They went off on a sidebar.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And they started
whispering to themselves.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, you, as a
patient, lying there,

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.720 align:middle line:84%
wondering what are
they talking about?

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And they came back and said,
can we remove something?

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.760 align:middle line:90%
We see some debris there.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.900 align:middle line:90%
We want to clear it out.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:56.380 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.340 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll cauterize
it, if that's OK.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:18:59.680 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.550 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:01.870 align:middle line:90%
And so they removed something.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:05.530 align:middle line:84%
They cleared out the
debris from my nose,

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:07.780 align:middle line:90%
and they cauterized it.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I always wondered
what did they find?

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they take any
specimens or test anything?

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RAMIREZ: I don't know.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And this was
during the Agency?

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:19.452 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: I was in the
Agency, and I don't know.

00:19:19.452 --> 00:19:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is why, when
I retired, I wanted

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:23.470 align:middle line:90%
to get my medical records.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.387 align:middle line:84%
And said, you can't have
your medical records.

00:19:25.387 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:90%
They're the property of CIA.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.900 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh, OK.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And so years later,
I wrote to CIA,

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:35.760 align:middle line:90%
requesting my medical records.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And I had to go
through a lot of hoops

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:43.290 align:middle line:84%
to prove who I am, which
they readily found out.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:47.340 align:middle line:84%
We all have this number,
called an agency identification

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.920 align:middle line:84%
number, and every CIA
officer has a unique number.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not 007, but
you get the idea.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.380 align:middle line:90%
We have a number.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And I gave them my
number, my badge number,

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.900 align:middle line:90%
and so they could look me up.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And I requested my
medical records,

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't
have them directly.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.500 align:middle line:84%
I had to send them
to a physician.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.690 align:middle line:90%
And I still--

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A civilian physician?

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: A former
government physician,

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and I still do not have any
access to that because I

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:16.890 align:middle line:90%
waived the HIPAA for it.

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And it was probably
sent to this physician.

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:21.460 align:middle line:90%
And I have no idea.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:22.260 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.135 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Interesting.

00:20:23.135 --> 00:20:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>>RAMIREZ: Yeah.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.477 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well,
maybe they're still

00:20:25.477 --> 00:20:27.030 align:middle line:84%
trying to hide
something that they

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.410 align:middle line:90%
don't want you to know about.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RAMIREZ: Maybe so.

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you
believe, over time,

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:36.450 align:middle line:84%
that your nonhuman DNA
will start dominating

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.580 align:middle line:90%
the most of your essence?

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: I don't think so,
because "nonhuman" sounds

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.370 align:middle line:90%
like you're a mutant.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's not a mutation.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.760 align:middle line:84%
We all have nonhuman
DNA, and we have DNA that

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.070 align:middle line:90%
used to be called junk DNA.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, we're
discovering more and more

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:59.490 align:middle line:84%
about the human genome,
and we're discovering

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:90%
that it does have functions.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And we're discovering
that there are

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.620 align:middle line:84%
splices in that genome that
are difficult to explain,

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:08.790 align:middle line:90%
that shouldn't be there.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: More functions
than the DNA we know about.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>RAMIREZ: Exactly, exactly.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
avenue of research,

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:84%
not just in this UAP field but
in just genomics, in general.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of study being
done about the human genome.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:84%
There's more mysteries in our
bodies than anywhere else.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:34.305 align:middle line:84%
And so I think, it's not that
it's becoming more prevalent.

00:21:34.305 --> 00:21:37.116 align:middle line:90%
It is who you are, you know?

00:21:37.116 --> 00:21:40.080 align:middle line:84%
It makes you who you
are, and I am who I am.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.400 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think I'm any
different than anyone else.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel
different other than

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:47.490 align:middle line:90%
that I've had these experiences.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:50.300 align:middle line:84%
But many other people have
had experiences as well,

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and whether they have enhanced
DNA or not, I don't know.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:84%
But I can only say for
myself that I consider it

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:03.930 align:middle line:90%
more of a gift to have this.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:05.370 align:middle line:90%
I take it that way.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:06.740 align:middle line:90%
That it's a gift for me.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It is a gift,
if you're aware of it.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe your
nonhuman DNA of this origin

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:18.230 align:middle line:84%
could possibly guide you
differently now that you're

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:21.740 align:middle line:90%
more aware of it than before?

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RAMIREZ: Yes, I do.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:27.790 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm more inspired
to learn about myself.

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:31.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm more inspired
to seek guidance

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:36.280 align:middle line:84%
in helping me through
this physical existence.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.000 align:middle line:84%
I am very much tuned into
this entire phenomenon

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.830 align:middle line:84%
in a greater way, more so than
just my personal experiences.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:48.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's becoming
richer, and it's

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:54.880 align:middle line:84%
helping me understand who I am
and what I need to be doing.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.700 align:middle line:84%
What my work is that
I was sent here to do.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:01.510 align:middle line:84%
So in those ways,
yes, it has helped me.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Has, in no way, has
hindered me at all.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So it helped to
guide you to the mission

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:10.190 align:middle line:84%
and gave you perspective
of where to go from here,

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:90%
such as being here.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.615 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: Exactly,
and that is the work

00:23:13.615 --> 00:23:14.740 align:middle line:90%
that I was sent here to do.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
inspiration I got

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:22.240 align:middle line:90%
from seeing that orb July 2020.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.810 align:middle line:90%
That I'm here to do a mission.

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm here to do some work.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And I need to share what I know,
and that these opportunities

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:33.360 align:middle line:84%
will come to you, where
you least expect it now.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.240 align:middle line:84%
People want to hear
what you have to say.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.120 align:middle line:84%
What about the
Saurians you mentioned?

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Are they extraterrestrial,
or are they from Earth?

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>>RAMIREZ: I have a belief.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.200 align:middle line:90%
This is my personal belief.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.220 align:middle line:84%
That they're closer
than we expect.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.530 align:middle line:84%
That they didn't just
travel here hundreds

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:54.690 align:middle line:84%
of light years away
or tens of light years

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.390 align:middle line:90%
away to be here at that moment.

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.360 align:middle line:84%
That they have always been
here, but we don't see them.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.410 align:middle line:90%
We're not aware of them.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:03.090 align:middle line:90%
They may be in hiding.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:84%
They may be on the moon,
on Mars, or nearby planets.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.710 align:middle line:84%
They may be here on the
Earth, in the Earth,

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.960 align:middle line:90%
or underneath the sea.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.180 align:middle line:84%
I think they're what is known
as an ultra-terrestrial.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Ultra-terrestrial, OK.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: They may have had
an extraterrestrial origin.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.230 align:middle line:84%
But we share the planet
with them, and they're here.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's just that they have
more advanced technology

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.020 align:middle line:90%
than we do, And they hide it.

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Until more recently,
they have been showing

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.348 align:middle line:90%
the technology they have.

00:24:34.348 --> 00:24:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, personally, what
do you think their agenda is,

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:37.910 align:middle line:90%
then?

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: To guide
us, to inspire us,

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.870 align:middle line:84%
to make us more
than what we are,

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:47.000 align:middle line:84%
to elevate us, to get
us prepared to join them

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000 align:middle line:84%
and an awareness of who we
are, where we came from,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.040 align:middle line:90%
and what we need to be doing.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And again, it goes back to
this Galactic Federation.

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Maybe their agenda
is for us to actually

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:00.470 align:middle line:84%
join the Galactic
Federation, to prepare us,

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:90%
but we're not there yet.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.170 align:middle line:90%
We're not ready yet.

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We've talked
about DNA of humans

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.420 align:middle line:84%
being in extraterrestrials
and also,

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.560 align:middle line:84%
humans having
extraterrestrial DNA.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Where do you think that's
going to be leading us

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.253 align:middle line:90%
to as we move into the future?

00:25:16.253 --> 00:25:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: I think
it will lead us

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:21.100 align:middle line:84%
to an understanding
of our cosmic origins,

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:23.090 align:middle line:90%
first and foremost.

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, assuming that they found
human DNA in the actual Roswell

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:33.510 align:middle line:84%
crash victims, assuming that
and then that they're Grays.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And others saying that the
Grays are biomechanical beings,

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.940 align:middle line:84%
that they were created to be
who they are, to be helpers,

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.420 align:middle line:84%
I would have to think that
since that DNA is also

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:51.000 align:middle line:84%
found in humans that we have
a common source of creation

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.010 align:middle line:84%
of someone or some other
beings that created both of us

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and imparted their
DNA onto us as well

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:03.060 align:middle line:84%
as the beings that were
discovered in the Roswell

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.260 align:middle line:90%
crash.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Be they biomechanical or
some other form of life,

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.160 align:middle line:90%
we don't quite understand.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And that goes back to a lot
of Earth's religious beliefs

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:20.170 align:middle line:84%
that a divine being
made us in its image.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And you can interpret
that in many ways,

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:26.320 align:middle line:84%
but in this cosmic
way of interpretation,

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.790 align:middle line:84%
some being more superior to
us, more advanced than us,

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:34.540 align:middle line:84%
had some intervention
in how we turned out

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.830 align:middle line:84%
by imparting some of their
genetic material into us.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And for where we
go from there, it's

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.910 align:middle line:84%
just a greater
understanding that we have

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.950 align:middle line:90%
this linear view of history.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
it's quite linear.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.470 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very
circular and very helical.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:55.450 align:middle line:10%
Because I think
that we are the way

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:57.820 align:middle line:10%
we are because of
something that happened

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:01.600 align:middle line:10%
long before we
remember as humans

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.100 align:middle line:10%
that made us who we are today.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.560 align:middle line:10%
And as we discovered
that, then it

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.070 align:middle line:10%
will lead us to a greater
understanding of what humanity

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:15.510 align:middle line:10%
is, and that we all
have this within us.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.580 align:middle line:84%
That no one is superior
to anyone else,

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.130 align:middle line:90%
especially if you're human.

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.870 align:middle line:90%
Because we have the same origin.

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.760 align:middle line:90%
We are from the same creator.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:29.120 align:middle line:10%
So it's a greater
understanding of who we are

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.230 align:middle line:10%
and that might help us--

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:32.400 align:middle line:10%
lead us to where we need to go.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You mentioned
the Agencies really

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.680 align:middle line:90%
interested in the bloodlines.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.975 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
is in the bloodlines

00:27:38.975 --> 00:27:40.100 align:middle line:90%
that they're interested in?

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: Yes, and the Agencies
are the CIA, in particular.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that they are
looking at human origins.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:54.710 align:middle line:84%
That they understood, through
the examination of alien DNA

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:59.170 align:middle line:84%
and the discovery that
some of that alien DNA

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:05.640 align:middle line:84%
is in human form, that they
want to know the origin of that.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And that certain humans
seem to have enhanced DNA.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you go project
backward, if you look at,

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:17.450 align:middle line:84%
for example, the story
of nonhuman intelligences

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:19.940 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, let's
say the Annunaki,

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:23.850 align:middle line:84%
they establish
kingship with humans.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And they enhanced certain
humans to be kings and queens

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.460 align:middle line:90%
and priests and priestesses.

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a separate class
of humans to rule over

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:35.840 align:middle line:90%
other humans in their name.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.380 align:middle line:90%
And that bloodline stayed pure.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:41.270 align:middle line:90%
It had to be pure.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So those with that background,
that aristocratic background,

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:49.400 align:middle line:84%
wanted to make sure that
their blood stayed pure.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:53.030 align:middle line:84%
They only married
within those bloodlines.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:54.500 align:middle line:90%
But that was a long time ago.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Projected to today, there's a
lot of mixing of humans now,

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and so it's almost like
the CIA saying, oh, yeah,

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:09.530 align:middle line:84%
we discovered that there
is human DNA in aliens

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.840 align:middle line:90%
and alien DNA in humans.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
certain families

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.700 align:middle line:84%
have this enhanced DNA, not just
regular human DNA but enhanced

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:18.500 align:middle line:90%
DNA.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.630 align:middle line:90%
How far back does it go?

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:22.550 align:middle line:90%
Who are their bloodlines?

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:24.650 align:middle line:90%
What is their genealogy?

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And so that goes back to the
establishment of kingship

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:36.010 align:middle line:84%
and how the nonhuman
intelligences,

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:39.770 align:middle line:84%
who came to settle here
and that brought us here

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.310 align:middle line:84%
wanted to enhance certain
of us to rule ourselves

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.880 align:middle line:90%
in their name.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what I
think it's all about.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:49.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like studying
the origins of humans

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:52.180 align:middle line:84%
in order to understand
what we're seeing today

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.900 align:middle line:84%
in these nonhuman intelligences
that may be amongst us.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You mention
enhancements.

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:02.500 align:middle line:84%
What enhancements did you hear
about that maybe they spoke of?

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: I didn't hear
anything particularly that

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:09.580 align:middle line:84%
was enhanced, such as you're
stronger or you're smarter

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.160 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.040 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's more
like, I would say

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.190 align:middle line:84%
it's an enhancement of human
consciousness and advancement

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:20.870 align:middle line:90%
of human potential.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:22.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
interested in.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they looking at
it as like a more pure essence

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:28.710 align:middle line:90%
of that first entity?

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:31.475 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: I hesitate to say
"pure," because any time you

00:30:31.475 --> 00:30:32.350 align:middle line:90%
use the word "pure--"

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:33.687 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Or concentrated.

00:30:33.687 --> 00:30:35.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know what
word to use for that.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: It seems
to say that some

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.230 align:middle line:84%
are more superior than others,
and I don't believe that.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:45.480 align:middle line:84%
I just believe it's just
part of our genetic makeup

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:52.350 align:middle line:84%
that certain people may have
a more direct lineage to those

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:56.490 align:middle line:84%
who were kings and queens
and priests and priestesses,

00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and that that lineage is seen in
that enhancement of human DNA.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:05.940 align:middle line:84%
But having said that, if this
process is still going on,

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.460 align:middle line:84%
then I would say that the
consciousness, the higher

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.950 align:middle line:84%
consciousness aspect
of the phenomenon

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:12.788 align:middle line:90%
is continuing and spreading.

00:31:12.788 --> 00:31:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There's
definitely something there

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.130 align:middle line:84%
they are interested in, because
they wouldn't be doing that.

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:22.630 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't be going to these
extreme measures to find out.

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.742 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: I think
that's a fair statement.

00:31:24.742 --> 00:31:26.200 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't be
wasting their time

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.660 align:middle line:90%
if there was no purpose in it.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And it goes to
what do they know?

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:34.140 align:middle line:84%
What are they preparing
us for that we don't know?

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:38.210 align:middle line:84%
I can speculate, but I
hesitate to do that, because--

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You never know.

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>RAMIREZ: We don't know.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: We don't know yet.

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.598 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: There's
just the feeling

00:31:42.598 --> 00:31:46.380 align:middle line:84%
that are we on the verge of
making a major discovery?

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And whether that comes through
science or through the nonhuman

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:54.360 align:middle line:84%
intelligences
appearing, I don't know.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.690 align:middle line:84%
I kind of get hints that
science will lead the way.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:00.960 align:middle line:84%
That there will be a scientific
discovery in the next few years

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.640 align:middle line:84%
that will make it
a compelling case

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.100 align:middle line:84%
that we need to go out
and invest the money

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.290 align:middle line:90%
to explore what they found.

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And what they found may
lead us to our origins.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:15.070 align:middle line:84%
It could be an artifact
or who knows what it is?

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:19.480 align:middle line:84%
But I've got the feeling
that NASA will lead the way.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And one of the purposes
of going back to the moon

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.958 align:middle line:84%
again and the James Webb
Space Telescope and everything

00:32:24.958 --> 00:32:27.000 align:middle line:84%
we're doing in space and
what other countries are

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.930 align:middle line:84%
doing in space will
lead us to a discovery.

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Something that was
built, not by humans,

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:39.570 align:middle line:84%
that may have a clue as to
who we are or why we are.

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:41.950 align:middle line:84%
It could be a replica of
something that exists on Earth,

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:42.750 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Whether it be an obelisk
or whether it be a pyramid

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.842 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it could
be, maybe there's

00:32:48.842 --> 00:32:50.550 align:middle line:84%
something out there
that NASA knows about

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:52.290 align:middle line:90%
that they need to explore.

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And once they make this
so-called discovery,

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:58.110 align:middle line:84%
then that would be the
impetus for the investment

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:02.760 align:middle line:84%
to occur to actually find
out what's out there.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And through a scientific
discovery, then, in a way,

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:08.730 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence community
has a way out, saying, yeah,

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:10.350 align:middle line:90%
we knew this all along.

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Oh, but look, the
scientific discovery.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:14.580 align:middle line:84%
We need to go
there and find out.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:18.303 align:middle line:84%
And meantime, they know
exactly what was up there.

00:33:18.303 --> 00:33:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That happens a lot.

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:24.672 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: And I always wondered
did we tell NASA where to look?

00:33:24.672 --> 00:33:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Look here and you might
find something interesting.

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:31.000 align:middle line:90%
So that remains to be seen.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking forward
to the revitalization

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:37.530 align:middle line:84%
of the human
spaceflight to the moon.

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to places to
the moon to make discoveries,

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and who knows what
they discover?

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Going to Mars, that might
be another step forward.

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:50.250 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime, they,
the nonhuman intelligence,

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:53.870 align:middle line:84%
may just show up in our
skies like they're doing now.

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:55.700 align:middle line:90%
But they're doing it piecemeal.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:59.440 align:middle line:84%
They're showing
up here and there.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Other than the Phoenix Lights,
that occurred decades ago,

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:07.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't know of a mass
sighting like that

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:10.620 align:middle line:84%
where you have a
formation that showed up.

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.179 align:middle line:90%
And maybe that might happen.

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And this time
around, we won't call

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:18.400 align:middle line:84%
them flares, because
we're smarter than that.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So on the
topic of hybrids,

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.110 align:middle line:84%
is there a final
takeaway you would like

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:23.909 align:middle line:90%
to leave us and the audience?

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: Hybrids
are humans, too.

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:27.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] They're not mutants.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:29.670 align:middle line:90%
Hybrids are not mutants.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:34.530 align:middle line:84%
In a way, we all become
hybrids naturally,

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:38.760 align:middle line:90%
as we adapt to our environment.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So my takeaway would be that
if people in your audience

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:49.340 align:middle line:84%
feel that they are hybrids
and perhaps some do,

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.670 align:middle line:84%
they should consider
that a gift, not a curse.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And through that
gift, they can use

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.820 align:middle line:84%
that to explore who
they are and why

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.550 align:middle line:84%
they're here, what
their mission is,

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:03.290 align:middle line:90%
and find some strength in that.

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And then seek out others,
who also might be hybrids.

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:09.350 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
most enjoyable parts

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:11.930 align:middle line:84%
of going into these
various conferences is

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:15.110 align:middle line:84%
to meeting like-minded
people, who believe as you do,

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and you can share your
experiences in a nonthreatening

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.010 align:middle line:90%
way, where there's no ridicule.

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:21.590 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RAMIREZ: And I love
that, and that's why

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.430 align:middle line:90%
I enjoy going to conferences.

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I enjoy speaking
to audiences, like yours,

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and to even podcasters
or other audiences.

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:41.250 align:middle line:84%
That the message I have is let's
take better care of the planet,

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:43.175 align:middle line:90%
just for everyone.

00:35:43.175 --> 00:35:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Thank
you so much, John.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:45.730 align:middle line:90%
It was great information.

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:46.990 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being on the show.

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>>RAMIREZ: Thank you very much.

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.380 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:55.130 align:middle line:90%
