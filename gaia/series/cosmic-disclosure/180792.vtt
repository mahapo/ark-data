[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:06.972 --> 00:00:19.512 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.512 --> 00:00:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.350 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, George Noory,
and I'm here with Emery Smith.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Pathogens-- they're not
just restricted to Earth.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:90%
They exist everywhere in space.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.837 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome back.

00:00:30.837 --> 00:00:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: First of all, explain
for us, what our pathogens?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.330 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, with any
type of biological entity,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.400 align:middle line:10%
you have cellular material,
such as a lot of the beings

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.850 align:middle line:10%
we work with have the
same type of blood.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.650 align:middle line:90%
Very similar.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.930 align:middle line:84%
They have white blood cells,
red blood cells, thrombocytes.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Now with that, there's always
other viruses and bacteria,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:84%
which are pathogens that like
to feed off of these other cells

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.660 align:middle line:84%
or mutate them in some
fashion or another.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What about the
possibilities of bioterrorism

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.870 align:middle line:90%
being done out in space.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, exactly.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:90%
This is what's happening.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.730 align:middle line:84%
When they acquire
beings from outer space,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.100 align:middle line:84%
let's say, that have
maybe had a shipwreck

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:84%
and their craft exploded,
they will take these bodies,

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:84%
and these bodies do come already
with bacteria and viruses

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.750 align:middle line:84%
on them that are
from un-Earth origin.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:84%
So big pharma is
really big on this.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.850 align:middle line:84%
So they will get
bodies, and they

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.420 align:middle line:84%
will test the
proteins of the DNA,

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and they will try to
find cures and things

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:84%
from otherworldly beings
and their cellular matrix.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Just like penicillin
is made from mold,

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.850 align:middle line:84%
the antibiotics are coming
from these negative type

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.990 align:middle line:84%
of pathogens, even when we
make recombinant proteins,

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.340 align:middle line:84%
that actually comes
from the E. coli virus.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.285 align:middle line:84%
So good things can come out of
these, but also, as you said--

00:01:56.285 --> 00:01:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Bad things.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Very bad
things can come up.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.760 align:middle line:84%
They can create new
viruses and things

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.770 align:middle line:84%
that are resistant to
the drugs that they make.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So even though they're
making a drug to cure you,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.989 align:middle line:84%
they can also make a virus
that's resistant to it.

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So they have to put money into
making something else that you

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.210 align:middle line:84%
have to buy that's
more expensive.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is it conceivable
that a pathogen can come here

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.612 align:middle line:84%
on an asteroid or
something like that?

00:02:19.612 --> 00:02:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, exactly.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.790 align:middle line:84%
We're all star dust
and star seeds.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is there's
many types of bacteria that

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.770 align:middle line:90%
can actually live in space.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.357 align:middle line:84%
So that being said, a lot
of these particulate matter

00:02:30.357 --> 00:02:32.690 align:middle line:84%
do get caught in our atmosphere
and eventually come down

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.030 align:middle line:84%
to the oceans and
to the surface.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.490 align:middle line:84%
So who's to say that a lot
of these new things that

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.530 align:middle line:84%
are sprouting up, like
these different viruses

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.120 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
also could have just

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.240 align:middle line:84%
been naturally, organically
implanted here and mixing

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.030 align:middle line:84%
with other viruses and
other cellular material

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.360 align:middle line:90%
to make a super virus?

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I mean, if something
like that did hit the planet,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.160 align:middle line:84%
it could literally wipe out
civilizations, couldn't it?

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Just as we
have disembarked deep

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.310 align:middle line:84%
into the Amazon, and these
aboriginal people and tribes

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.530 align:middle line:84%
out there have never been
exposed to certain bacteria,

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.330 align:middle line:90%
simple things--

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: They get wiped out.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They get
completely wiped out.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.630 align:middle line:84%
With the advent of all the
traveling and the millions

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.570 align:middle line:84%
of flights that are
happening every day,

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.890 align:middle line:84%
it'd be easy just for
one person to transmit

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.090 align:middle line:84%
one virus all the way around
the world within 24 hours.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:90%
And it just mutates so quickly.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.420 align:middle line:84%
The virus will encapsulate
so many people, especially

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.300 align:middle line:84%
the older population and
the younger population

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.784 align:middle line:84%
and those with
immune deficiencies.

00:03:30.784 --> 00:03:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How long
would it take science

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:84%
to say, this pathogen
is not from this planet,

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:84%
and we don't know
how to stop it?

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They do
test the DNA on a lot

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.830 align:middle line:84%
of these different
pathogens to find out

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.700 align:middle line:84%
where did they originate from,
or where do they mutate from?

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So far, I'm not
aware of anything

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:84%
that has been mutated
from off planet,

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.110 align:middle line:84%
even though I'm
aware of them keeping

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:84%
encapsulated in secret
compartmentalized projects

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.260 align:middle line:84%
in underground facilities many
different types of viruses

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and pathogens that they have
collected from around space

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and around the planet that
did not originate from here.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.210 align:middle line:84%
But as far as the viruses
that are out there right

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.120 align:middle line:84%
now the cold viruses and
even this new bird virus

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.120 align:middle line:84%
that's going around that there
was a big scare three weeks ago

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.959 align:middle line:84%
in China, and this is what's
happening-- these viruses

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:84%
here are mutating, and they
are also being man-made.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What about
extraterrestrial viruses

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.410 align:middle line:84%
created by
extraterrestrial races

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.480 align:middle line:90%
to wipe out other civilizations?

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's more of
a synergistic thing.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Just like we have very
healthy bacteria in our gut

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.040 align:middle line:84%
to keep us alive and
also on our skin that

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.280 align:middle line:84%
helps fight off negative
viruses and bacteria,

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.490 align:middle line:90%
they have the same thing.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's not an
intentional thing,

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.350 align:middle line:84%
but it is something
that they would see us

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.640 align:middle line:90%
as a foreign virus ourselves.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So if their cells would
happen to mix with us,

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.600 align:middle line:84%
yeah, it could definitely
wipe out the entire planet.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.740 align:middle line:84%
I think really
hypothetically speaking,

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:84%
people are just
out there getting

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.990 align:middle line:90%
programmed by pop culture.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.920 align:middle line:84%
They don't need
anything we have.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.340 align:middle line:84%
They have already mastered
interdimensional travels.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.790 align:middle line:84%
They have mastered traversing
the universe, which

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.340 align:middle line:84%
means they're not using
gas, coal, and oil.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.980 align:middle line:84%
They're using some
sort of energy.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.680 align:middle line:84%
They're able to 3D print
anything they want--

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.320 align:middle line:90%
their food, their minerals.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.840 align:middle line:90%
They can grow a craft in space.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.670 align:middle line:84%
So they don't
really need anything

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.940 align:middle line:84%
that we have here on Earth,
except probably for us

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.847 align:middle line:90%
to survive.

00:05:29.847 --> 00:05:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So I want you to
go out on a limb here, Emery.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.040 align:middle line:84%
What you're saying
is that you do not

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.470 align:middle line:84%
believe there are
extraterrestrial races

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.820 align:middle line:84%
out there that would try to
contaminate us or kill us

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.944 align:middle line:84%
with special
pathogens or viruses?

00:05:42.944 --> 00:05:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Alls I'm
saying is, there

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:84%
are races out there that
could possibly do that,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.960 align:middle line:90%
but they're not allowed to.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: By?

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: By, I think, some
sort of galactic federation.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:84%
You don't think there's a
rogue race out there that would

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.090 align:middle line:90%
do what they wanted to do?

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.673 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I think there's
a lot of rogue races out there.

00:05:59.673 --> 00:06:01.790 align:middle line:84%
I also believe there's
a lot more positivity

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.049 align:middle line:84%
in the universe with
these beings that

00:06:04.049 --> 00:06:05.090 align:middle line:90%
are trying to protect us.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're still here.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.410 align:middle line:84%
I think even if there was a
dangerous extraterrestrial

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.190 align:middle line:84%
civilization coming here,
they still would probably just

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.060 align:middle line:90%
be monitoring things.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.384 align:middle line:84%
I do believe of Inner-Earth
extraterrestrials

00:06:17.384 --> 00:06:18.800 align:middle line:84%
that have been
here longer than us

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.230 align:middle line:90%
that may have another agenda.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.840 align:middle line:84%
My own opinion-- just because
of being in the projects

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and hearing some of
these people talk

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.820 align:middle line:84%
and picking up on cues about
these Inner-Earth beings.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's many
different civilizations

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:84%
that live in
Inner-Earth that have

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.180 align:middle line:84%
been here longer than we have
that are doing monitoring

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:90%
and other things.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.680 align:middle line:84%
So I think maybe they might
have an expectation of,

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:84%
well, we were here
first type of thing.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Could that agenda
be to change the human breed,

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.250 align:middle line:84%
basically create a
different hybrid species?

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I think
that's just inevitable.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.410 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
interbreeding in the future.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.960 align:middle line:84%
The hybrids that
they've already made

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.557 align:middle line:90%
are already part human and not--

00:07:01.557 --> 00:07:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: We could
be hybrids already.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And we are hybrids.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.390 align:middle line:90%
We are definitely hybrids.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.470 align:middle line:84%
We have genetic depositions
from all the different types

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.260 align:middle line:84%
of star systems
around this universe

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.090 align:middle line:84%
that you can see
through your telescope.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And the only way we can
prove this to the public

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.240 align:middle line:84%
is to eventually-- hopefully
the compartmentalized projects

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.730 align:middle line:84%
and these corporations
will release the DNA

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.670 align:middle line:84%
genetic database that
they have, because just

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.630 align:middle line:84%
like with the Atacama Being that
we were taking the DNA on just

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.550 align:middle line:84%
recently, as I was
published there

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.160 align:middle line:84%
at Stanford University
with Dr. Garry Nolan.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.250 align:middle line:84%
There's things going on that are
going to come to the surface.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:43.670 align:middle line:84%
But without having the
proper genetic DNA library,

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.845 align:middle line:84%
and you come up
short 8% on something

00:07:45.845 --> 00:07:48.200 align:middle line:84%
and you can't
figure it out, that

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.570 align:middle line:84%
would fill in the
gap for many things.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Even the gap of going
from Cro-Magnon man

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.940 align:middle line:84%
to us, to say, hey,
well, what happened here?

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And why do we have these
extra gaps in our DNA?

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Where do they come from?

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: The late
Zecharia Sitchin

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:06.290 align:middle line:84%
contends that we were
genetically altered,

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:10.010 align:middle line:84%
that the Anunnaki, a different
race, different ET race,

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:84%
came from a planet
called Nibiru,

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.600 align:middle line:84%
and came here to
genetically modify us

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.310 align:middle line:90%
because they needed workers.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.350 align:middle line:90%
Hence, here we are.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I believe
in the Anunnaki,

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:90%
and that they did come here.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And we did have
some help getting

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:90%
to who we are today for sure.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't agree, or I'm
not sure about them

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.809 align:middle line:84%
collecting gold or
using us as slaves,

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:35.270 align:middle line:84%
but we definitely
had help as far

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.130 align:middle line:90%
as evolving into human beings.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.110 align:middle line:84%
It just didn't happen
out of nowhere.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.841 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Are they our gods?

00:08:41.841 --> 00:08:43.549 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I wouldn't
say they're our gods.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.070 align:middle line:84%
I would say that they're
more advanced than us,

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and more advanced than
most civilizations.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.760 align:middle line:84%
They have mastered
interdimensional travels.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:84%
But they can only come
here at certain times

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:59.410 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth's life,
which means that there's

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.160 align:middle line:84%
only certain times
when the dimensions are

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.340 align:middle line:84%
right that they're
allowed to come to Earth

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.830 align:middle line:84%
and travel back and forth for
a very short period of time.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So in
many cases, you have

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.370 align:middle line:84%
been surrounded by things
that I would call benevolent,

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:90%
positive.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.221 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.000 align:middle line:84%
The majority of everything
I've been exposed to

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.160 align:middle line:90%
was very benevolent.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.451 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I mean, because of
everybody I've interviewed

00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:25.740 align:middle line:84%
in my career, you are one of the
least negative people I've ever

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.540 align:middle line:90%
talked to.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people will
tell you, doom and gloom.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.860 align:middle line:90%
It's over for us.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.690 align:middle line:90%
They're coming to get us.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:90%
You're just the opposite.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.971 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They would have
already came and got us.

00:09:35.971 --> 00:09:38.930 align:middle line:84%
It's obvious that the way
the Earth is going right now,

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.790 align:middle line:90%
they're here to support us.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And because of what
I've been involved

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.420 align:middle line:84%
with these
compartmentalized projects,

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.690 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen any
shenanigans going

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.820 align:middle line:84%
on where they were
trying to blow up a base

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.160 align:middle line:90%
or take out the human race.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.719 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these ETs, of course,
their ancestry has created us.

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:55.885 align:middle line:90%
Like you said, the Anunnaki.

00:09:55.885 --> 00:09:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Why would you want to
create something and destroy

00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.700 align:middle line:90%
it?

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.260 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any sense.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.680 align:middle line:84%
You would want it to
evolve and study it and see

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.490 align:middle line:90%
what they're capable of doing.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Also, I really
believe that we are

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:12.110 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom of the pyramid,
as far as the evolution

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:13.310 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrials.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.340 align:middle line:84%
I really believe we came
from extraterrestrials,

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.520 align:middle line:84%
and most importantly,
extraterrestrials came from us.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now back to the
pathogens for a moment.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.590 align:middle line:84%
How could we even create
a cure for something

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:28.340 align:middle line:84%
that comes from outer space when
we don't even know what it is?

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, if that virus or
that bacteria or that pathogen

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.670 align:middle line:84%
falls into the
three-dimensional space,

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.590 align:middle line:90%
there's always a solution.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget, the human
body is very resilient.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:90%
We're not all exactly the same.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So the body can
mutate on its own

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.060 align:middle line:84%
to fight a certain
pathogen, and that's

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.180 align:middle line:84%
how we have become such
a successful species.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Over hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of thousands of years,

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.700 align:middle line:90%
we get stronger.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:90%
Our DNA changes.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.720 align:middle line:84%
It learns how to make special
macrophages and the white blood

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle line:84%
cells to combat these types
of pathogens and survive.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we are.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.390 align:middle line:84%
We're one of the toughest
races in the universe,

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.570 align:middle line:84%
being bombarded EMF
and scalar inphotometry

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and viruses and all
these negative things,

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.200 align:middle line:90%
but we still seem to keep going.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.187 align:middle line:84%
We have a very short
lifespan compared

00:11:18.187 --> 00:11:20.270 align:middle line:84%
to the other extraterrestrials
that are out there,

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.700 align:middle line:84%
but that's just because they're
more advanced than we are.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
be there someday too.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is there
a special program

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:31.370 align:middle line:84%
by governments to try to
avert these kinds of problems?

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's an ongoing
thing where viruses

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle line:84%
are released accidentally,
contamination

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.600 align:middle line:90%
occurs, outbreaks happen.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:84%
It's completely kept
under the blanket.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.250 align:middle line:84%
That means the
media is not allowed

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.695 align:middle line:90%
to know about it, the CDC--

00:11:44.695 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well,
there'd be panic.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It'd be super--

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.510 align:middle line:84%
chaos, panic, stock
markets would crash--

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.160 align:middle line:84%
it would be a really
horrific thing.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:84%
But this happens
on a daily basis.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.930 align:middle line:84%
There are teams
out there that will

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:00.440 align:middle line:84%
neutralize an entire
base of scientists

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.800 align:middle line:90%
if an outbreak happens.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And if it gets to
the surface, they

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.900 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't mind taking
out a small couple city

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.940 align:middle line:84%
blocks to do it and just
blame it on a gas leak.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.140 align:middle line:84%
How could they be so foolish to
have those kinds of accidents

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:13.940 align:middle line:90%
occur?

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, humans have ego,
and we're all in competition,

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of these things
happen with internal espionage

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.320 align:middle line:90%
with agents.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, they're
trying to figure out

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.630 align:middle line:84%
the biology of these
pathogens and use it

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.640 align:middle line:90%
for the good and the bad.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's very rare that they
would make something bad first.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I think if
governments could create

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.640 align:middle line:84%
pathogens that
could destroy, they

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.400 align:middle line:90%
would be making it like crazy.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.400 align:middle line:90%
I think they already do.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: They do.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And that being said,
some of these pathogens

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:49.430 align:middle line:84%
actually can attack just
certain genetic DNA--

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.110 align:middle line:90%
certain races.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Give us an example
of this genetic attack

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.590 align:middle line:90%
on specific races.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.836 align:middle line:84%
And have you been part
of that secret program?

00:12:59.836 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I wasn't part
of the secret program,

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:03.320 align:middle line:84%
but I was debriefed
on that program,

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.970 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
these pathogens had

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:09.260 align:middle line:84%
come from some of the bodies
that I was taking samples from.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.810 align:middle line:84%
When those samples go out,
they do all sorts of things.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:90%
And I was always curious.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.830 align:middle line:84%
After a couple of years,
I was able to be debriefed

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:19.730 align:middle line:84%
on them getting
cellular material,

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:23.870 align:middle line:84%
like you said, making it into
a virus or a bacteria that

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:27.530 align:middle line:84%
can eat with just that
entity, that being.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So that being said, they could
do the same thing for us.

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.090 align:middle line:84%
If they just want to
wipe out Caucasians,

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.070 align:middle line:84%
they could wipe out
all the Caucasians.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Have they tested that?

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, they have.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And has
it been effective?

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.590 align:middle line:84%
They have huge underground
facilities and mock cities

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:46.040 align:middle line:84%
set up larger than
football fields,

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:50.510 align:middle line:84%
that they actually use real
people and some clones,

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:51.994 align:middle line:84%
and they release
these outbreaks.

00:13:51.994 --> 00:13:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: These poor
people have no idea

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.010 align:middle line:84%
that this was going
to happen, obviously.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.380 align:middle line:84%
They'd have no idea
they've been mind swiped,

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and they've been captured,
and a lot of them

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.060 align:middle line:84%
have no clue whatsoever that
they're even in a project,

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.170 align:middle line:84%
because these scenarios
only last less than a day.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And everyone at the end
is completely gassed

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.160 align:middle line:90%
and taken out and disposed of.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How many
people have they killed?

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Hundreds of thousands.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Hundreds of thousands?

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Hundreds of thousands,
easy, per facility per year.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So let's say that
they are aiming at Caucasians

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.710 align:middle line:84%
or Asians or Africans,
and they just

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.560 align:middle line:90%
want to eliminate certain races.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.935 align:middle line:84%
They have experimented on
them, and it's been successful,

00:14:32.935 --> 00:14:33.735 align:middle line:90%
in your opinion?

00:14:33.735 --> 00:14:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Very successful.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:35.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: How do we combat that?

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think there's
going to be a lot more

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:42.371 align:middle line:84%
of these insiders
from these projects.

00:14:42.371 --> 00:14:43.870 align:middle line:84%
They're just scared
to come forward,

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.911 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of these people
are on their deathbeds,

00:14:45.911 --> 00:14:48.800 align:middle line:84%
and they want to come
forward, give a statement,

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and let the public know about
this so a proper investigation

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.680 align:middle line:90%
can follow this.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So we need
to be more concerned,

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.060 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like, people
on this planet, then

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.920 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials trying
to do something to us.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, 110%, George.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.010 align:middle line:84%
We're more egoed
and want the control

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and want to take over
or depopulate the planet

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.060 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the
agenda is, because

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.990 align:middle line:84%
by getting these contaminants
and these pathogens

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.360 align:middle line:84%
and making these in the
labs, like you said,

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.680 align:middle line:84%
this is a very bad biological
agent that can be used in war.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.400 align:middle line:84%
So of course, one
corporation can sell this

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.250 align:middle line:84%
to multiple countries, and
they wouldn't even know.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well we've seen
cases where chemicals harmed

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.560 align:middle line:90%
or hurt or killed people.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:84%
We saw the episode
where the half brother

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.940 align:middle line:84%
of the North Korean
leader Kim Jong Un

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:43.430 align:middle line:84%
was sprayed by a couple
people at an airport and died.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:44.300 align:middle line:90%
So you're right.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, these things exist.

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:90%
They're out there.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look what
happened to Russia,

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.010 align:middle line:90%
if you read Tom Bearden's work.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:55.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's only a few
scalar weapons on the planet,

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and there's only a few
countries that own these things.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Somebody watching
"Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.780 align:middle line:84%
this program, right
now, what can they

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.772 align:middle line:84%
do when they hear these
horrendous possibilities?

00:16:05.772 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I'll just say,
there's a lot more good

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.360 align:middle line:84%
people on this planet and a
lot more good corporations

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and a lot more white hats
secretly in political areas

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:84%
then there are the
negative people.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And there are scientists that
work on these projects that

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.630 align:middle line:84%
have developed these
things forcefully

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:24.964 align:middle line:90%
or have been extorted to.

00:16:24.964 --> 00:16:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And they
didn't want to do it?

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They did
not want to do it.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.220 align:middle line:84%
But they also are
a great facilitator

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.389 align:middle line:84%
of making sure these
things don't get out.

00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You think we
can win this battle?

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.388 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I know we'll win it.

00:16:36.388 --> 00:16:37.970 align:middle line:90%
It's just a matter of time.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:39.480 align:middle line:90%
All truth always prevails.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to instill
fear into the public,

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.180 align:middle line:84%
because I know too
many good things that

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.190 align:middle line:90%
are going on in the projects.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.820 align:middle line:84%
A lot more good things are going
on as far as protection for us

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.610 align:middle line:84%
and the elimination
of these things,

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.057 align:middle line:90%
because it's too dangerous.

00:16:54.057 --> 00:16:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: By whom, though?

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.261 align:middle line:90%
Who's really out to protect us?

00:16:57.261 --> 00:16:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well the
actual people that

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.280 align:middle line:84%
are working in these
projects, number one.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.250 align:middle line:84%
They have families
too, and they're not

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.349 align:middle line:84%
very happy about the way
they're being treated.

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is there an
internal fight here, Emery,

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:09.880 align:middle line:90%
between the good and the bad?

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.379 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's not
an internal fight.

00:17:11.379 --> 00:17:15.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the unheard heroes that
are in there being very patient,

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.470 align:middle line:84%
waiting for the right time, and
self-sacrificing their lives,

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:19.849 align:middle line:90%
which has been done many times.

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Even in the Denver
base, those explosions

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.740 align:middle line:84%
were from their
own employees that

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.890 align:middle line:84%
were trying to take out some
of the underground facilities

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:29.780 align:middle line:90%
there a few years back.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So there are a
lot of white hats,

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.650 align:middle line:84%
even in the
political government,

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.120 align:middle line:90%
and even in big pharma.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And these other
major corporations

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:40.910 align:middle line:84%
that run the planet, that
they're watching everything,

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and they're waiting
for the right time

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:48.500 align:middle line:84%
that they can be defensive
and be protective,

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:54.150 align:middle line:84%
because there's 7.5 billion
people here that are at risk.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You've
been in laboratories.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been
asked to do something

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:90%
that you didn't want to do?

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.680 align:middle line:84%
My last few months
though, working

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.500 align:middle line:84%
in the compartmentalized labs,
one of the reasons I left

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:12.020 align:middle line:84%
is because one of the
bodies that came in

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.320 align:middle line:84%
seemed very warm,
even through the suit.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Human bodies?

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, human
extraterrestrial bodies.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: OK.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.853 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We have temperature
gauges all over the bodies.

00:18:20.853 --> 00:18:22.630 align:middle line:90%
We know what the warmth is.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed to me
and it felt in my heart

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:31.120 align:middle line:84%
that this ET died
unnecessarily, somehow.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was more of
feeling like this

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.380 align:middle line:84%
is a real conscious being
that has just passed

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.340 align:middle line:90%
within maybe a few hours.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Or was killed.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:42.933 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, that's
what I'm saying.

00:18:42.933 --> 00:18:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What did this
human to ET look like?

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.717 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It was very tall,
a little bit taller than me.

00:18:47.717 --> 00:18:50.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm six foot four, so it was
probably around seven feet.

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.680 align:middle line:84%
It had very pale skin,
very large blue eyes.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: White hair?

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No hair.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.461 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: No hair at all.

00:18:56.461 --> 00:19:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No hair, very small
lips, and a very long nose.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:02.830 align:middle line:84%
The eyes were offset,
almond-shaped but more

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:07.570 align:middle line:84%
to the side, a little bit
wider than our eye set.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.680 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part, has
everything that we have--

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:84%
the five star, two
hands, two arms,

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.100 align:middle line:84%
just a very active
ectomorphic type of body.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.910 align:middle line:84%
An ectomorph means
long, lean bone.

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.920 align:middle line:84%
There's three body
human somatotypes

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.240 align:middle line:84%
that we call ectomorph,
mesomorph, and endomorph.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And this tells you how
the body actually looks

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.500 align:middle line:90%
when we're describing things.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How did this
entity die, in your opinion?

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think it
died very unnatural.

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was after that time that
I was becoming more conscious,

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.070 align:middle line:84%
and I knew it was either
stay in the projects

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.922 align:middle line:84%
forever, or go ahead
and it's time to resign.

00:19:44.922 --> 00:19:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And you left?

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.842 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I left.

00:19:46.842 --> 00:19:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You think that was
the smart thing to do for you?

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.277 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:19:50.277 --> 00:19:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You never looked back?

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, never.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did you do
anything with the government

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:58.010 align:middle line:90%
that you're not proud of?

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm very proud to have
worked hand-in-hand

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.790 align:middle line:84%
with some of the most amazing
surgeons and physicians

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and scientists from
around the world

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.510 align:middle line:90%
and from around the universe.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.850 align:middle line:84%
It was a great
blessing in disguise,

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.430 align:middle line:90%
and I kind of miss it, in a way.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Being responsible for
multi-million dollar equipment

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:20.500 align:middle line:84%
and being a huge asset to the
military and to these projects,

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.330 align:middle line:84%
not knowing that
was worth that much.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And then getting
out, and then being

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.020 align:middle line:84%
able to produce patents and
things to help society and help

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.202 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:20:30.202 --> 00:20:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Throughout the
history, mankind, of course,

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:35.410 align:middle line:84%
has tried to take advantage
of other human beings.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:37.150 align:middle line:90%
They've done that all along.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Can ETs do the same thing?

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
they were once us.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.430 align:middle line:84%
But let's just say they've grown
up a little bit since then.

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:51.550 align:middle line:84%
So their agenda is not about
taking over and destroying.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.880 align:middle line:84%
It's more about
preservation and helping

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.620 align:middle line:90%
a society that needs help.

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we need help.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at us.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.150 align:middle line:90%
Look what we're doing today--

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.610 align:middle line:84%
destroying the Earth and
destroying each other.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.650 align:middle line:84%
What kind of successful
society does that?

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: All these viruses that
are on the planet right now,

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.860 align:middle line:84%
might they have
been dumped on us?

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think they're
planetary bound?

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think
the planet evolves.

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:18.910 align:middle line:84%
We're discovering new species
every day in the oceans,

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:84%
in the Amazon, I
mean, every day.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So what's not to say bacteria
and viruses are species too?

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.390 align:middle line:84%
So these things are
mutating, forming

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:31.030 align:middle line:84%
through all different
types of reasons.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Which I think it's
synergistically

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.650 align:middle line:84%
working with the
stars, the stardust.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.770 align:middle line:84%
I think it is
happening where maybe

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:41.170 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these hybridization
programs, some things

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:41.970 align:middle line:90%
do leak out.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Some of these bacteria, some of
the beings escape now and then,

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.999 align:middle line:84%
and that will change the
entire ecosystem of a planet.

00:21:50.999 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: These ET
races, Emery, that

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.240 align:middle line:84%
are out there, what is their
mission and their goal?

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Are they trying to
breed us and change us.

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:00.726 align:middle line:90%
Or blend their DNA with us?

00:22:00.726 --> 00:22:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I
think a long time ago,

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:03.700 align:middle line:90%
that might have been the case.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.590 align:middle line:84%
I do think they
were breeding us.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I think they were
experimenting with us.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:12.470 align:middle line:84%
I do think we were like an
experiment that flourished,

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:13.270 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Even though there's a lot of bad
things going on, as a species,

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.710 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at us.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.540 align:middle line:90%
We are resilient.

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:20.740 align:middle line:90%
We're like a virus.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.150 align:middle line:84%
We go everywhere,
infect everything,

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:26.830 align:middle line:84%
and it's a great survival
capability that we have.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:28.630 align:middle line:84%
So I think they
admire that, and I

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:84%
think that they know that we
were the first seeds, even

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.360 align:middle line:90%
though they made us.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.940 align:middle line:84%
I think that we become them,
and I think they become us.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Could they take
the best of their DNA

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.837 align:middle line:84%
and the best of
ours and combine it?

00:22:40.837 --> 00:22:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, absolutely.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.878 align:middle line:90%
That's what's going on.

00:22:42.878 --> 00:22:45.040 align:middle line:84%
It's perfecting our
DNA, number one.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.350 align:middle line:90%
We're trying to perfect our DNA.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:50.530 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to do DNA tests
so we know what kind of cancers

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.560 align:middle line:84%
we might be predisposed
to, things like that,

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:59.080 align:middle line:84%
which help us learn how to do
gene therapy and help cure us.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.470 align:middle line:84%
So these things are all back
reverse engineered technologies

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.801 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence and ideas
from extraterrestrials.

00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So you're
basically saying

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.760 align:middle line:84%
there's a cross-breeding program
that's going on universally,

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.560 align:middle line:90%
aren't you?

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.300 align:middle line:84%
We came from the ETs,
the ETs came from us?

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:15.957 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: How so?

00:23:15.957 --> 00:23:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, just
like we're interbreeding

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:20.190 align:middle line:84%
with different countries
and continents and races

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.980 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth, don't
be fooled that we

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.530 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't do the same
thing if we were in space.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:30.510 align:middle line:84%
The gene manipulation is not
happening on a mass production.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.810 align:middle line:84%
They are doing these single
tests on single humans

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrials on
both sides of the story

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:42.510 align:middle line:84%
here, to figure out how to
improve life and how to--

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Governments and ETs?

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Together?

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.541 align:middle line:84%
Government does not
mean governments.

00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:49.410 align:middle line:84%
It just means--
because governments

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:51.970 align:middle line:84%
control the military, which
protects the corporation's

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:52.770 align:middle line:90%
labs.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:53.893 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it that way.

00:23:53.893 --> 00:23:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because
when people think--

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.009 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, there's
a different agenda

00:23:57.009 --> 00:23:58.590 align:middle line:90%
what's with that side of it.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Isn't there?

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're doing a
lot of this testing, though,

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:05.340 align:middle line:84%
to more, like you said,
make a super human.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Make them improve so we have
telepathic communication that's

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:13.050 align:middle line:84%
easier, and also to levitate
and things like this.

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:15.390 align:middle line:84%
We're all capable
of amazing things.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:18.120 align:middle line:84%
It's just we're not
really turned on yet

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.740 align:middle line:84%
on those DNA genetic
codes yet, including

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.940 align:middle line:84%
activating different parts of
the brain to do certain things.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Maybe they're trying
to build super soldiers.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Correct.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they are doing
things like that too--

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.650 align:middle line:84%
not only for soldiers,
but also mixing DNA

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:37.920 align:middle line:84%
with animals and soldiers
to make the ultimate combat

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.721 align:middle line:90%
weapon.

00:24:38.721 --> 00:24:40.595 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Emery, you've
been in a laboratory.

00:24:40.595 --> 00:24:41.760 align:middle line:90%
You've touched viruses.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.090 align:middle line:90%
You've been all over the place.

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been
exposed to anything

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.330 align:middle line:90%
from ETs or even human viruses?

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Only recombinant
proteins and DNA.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.070 align:middle line:90%
Nothing from an actual ET.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:55.050 align:middle line:84%
We have these very
amazing suits that we

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:56.880 align:middle line:90%
wear that are very protective.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.720 align:middle line:84%
We're in vacuum negative
pressure systems,

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.270 align:middle line:84%
so it's unlikely you'd
get contaminated.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:04.270 align:middle line:90%
It can happen.

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:07.920 align:middle line:84%
We have had incidents
on the facilities where

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.590 align:middle line:84%
there has been a
breach in the suits

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:13.350 align:middle line:84%
or in an operating
room where they had

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:14.850 align:middle line:90%
to shut down that whole area.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:16.683 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What's the
worst thing you've ever

00:25:16.683 --> 00:25:18.720 align:middle line:84%
seen to somebody
who has contracted

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.290 align:middle line:90%
some of these viruses?

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:22.530 align:middle line:90%
What happens to them?

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, the only
thing I've ever heard of--

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.030 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen it--

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:31.910 align:middle line:84%
that someone's suit
somehow was compromised.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:38.390 align:middle line:84%
The frequency of this virus or
whatever it was so vibratory,

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:41.970 align:middle line:84%
the cells around your human
body couldn't keep up with it.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:45.230 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of disintegrated
them from the inside out.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I think the primordial
soup is the same throughout

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:53.750 align:middle line:84%
the universe, so the complexity
and the mixture of all of us--

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.360 align:middle line:84%
we're all related, I
think, universally.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.450 align:middle line:90%
Aren't we?

00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well that's
the concept here,

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.590 align:middle line:84%
is trying to figure out how to
raise our consciousness, number

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:06.800 align:middle line:84%
one, and number two, don't
forget, we're all one.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.200 align:middle line:84%
If you really think
of it that way--

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.210 align:middle line:90%
and science says we are.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:15.410 align:middle line:84%
We all have the same genetics,
or part of each other,

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.580 align:middle line:90%
even extraterrestrials.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:21.320 align:middle line:84%
So that has definitely
led me to believe

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.510 align:middle line:84%
that we do have a
oneness that's connected,

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:28.040 align:middle line:84%
a same vibration,
a same frequency.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.460 align:middle line:84%
If we just start learning
to listen to each other

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and communicate
correctly and not

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.050 align:middle line:84%
get this communication
mixed up, I

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:38.000 align:middle line:84%
think we'd all get along
a little bit better.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is there an ongoing
ET genetic manipulation

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:42.590 align:middle line:90%
of our genes?

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.375 align:middle line:90%
Are they doing that now?

00:26:44.375 --> 00:26:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I don't think
they're trying to look at us

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.650 align:middle line:84%
and send down a type
of special energy beam

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:53.750 align:middle line:90%
or infect us with anything.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:57.230 align:middle line:84%
I think we're evolving this
way because the universe is

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:58.310 align:middle line:90%
evolving.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And I believe in this
morphogenic field of energy

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.640 align:middle line:84%
that if there's a lot
of good things going on,

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.020 align:middle line:84%
even getting evolved
as a human being,

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.040 align:middle line:90%
that it's affecting us that way.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Whether they have their
little big meditation

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:84%
group going on the other
side of the planet,

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.330 align:middle line:84%
that's a good way to
look at it, because it's

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:23.870 align:middle line:84%
affecting the entire universe,
including us becoming more

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:90%
conscious and more intelligent.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Will we
become super humans

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:31.190 align:middle line:90%
because of ET manipulation?

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I like to see it as
this, because at one point,

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.570 align:middle line:84%
during a telepathic
communication,

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:41.780 align:middle line:84%
they believe we are
the super humans.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.810 align:middle line:84%
They believe we're the
superheroes of the universe,

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.510 align:middle line:84%
because we're so resilient,
we've been through so much,

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:49.180 align:middle line:90%
and we're still here.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.810 align:middle line:90%
And we're not going anywhere.

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Emery, thank you for
being on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Thank you,
George, for having me.

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: This is "Cosmic
Disclosure" with Emery Smith.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.030 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:04.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Coming this season
on "Cosmic Disclosure"

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.910 align:middle line:10%
where people share their
clandestine involvement with

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.100 align:middle line:10%
government agencies,
the military,

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.290 align:middle line:10%
and secret space programs.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And I think a lot
of these new species that

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:15.680 align:middle line:84%
are discovered around
the planet every day

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.460 align:middle line:84%
are because extraterrestrial
craft and extraterrestrials

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.080 align:middle line:90%
being introduced here.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.440 align:middle line:10%
>> The blockade that is
preventing the passage of ships

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.800 align:middle line:10%
into our solar system decides
what and where and how things

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.970 align:middle line:10%
are going to happen.

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>> These beings are coming in.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.360 align:middle line:90%
We have a commodity-- people--

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and they're not very attached
to us anyway, like a ball,

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:37.650 align:middle line:84%
so they started using
us as a commodity.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:46.976 align:middle line:90%
