[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:14.152 --> 00:00:19.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY Weidner: Hey, everybody.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jay Weidner.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're continuing our
conversation with Jason Rice.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.780 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Jason.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JASON RICE: Hello, Jay.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.760 align:middle line:10%
And thank you for having me.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.880 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: Today, we're going on
a different vein of thought

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.660 align:middle line:10%
here, in particular, your
experiences with weapons,

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.910 align:middle line:10%
technologies, the incredible
spacesuit that you had.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So let's start out
with the simplest.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.590 align:middle line:84%
What was like, your
basic outfit that they

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:90%
gave you to fight these wars?

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Oh, sure, the
standard uniform consisted of,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:84%
you know, BDUs, a
battle defense uniform.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.800 align:middle line:84%
So it was a digicam pattern
of green, forest green,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.240 align:middle line:90%
dark green, grays, whites.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.555 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Digicam pattern?

00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: A digicam pattern.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Are you saying
that the suit itself

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.050 align:middle line:90%
was a digit projection?

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The pattern
on the material

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.110 align:middle line:84%
is a heavily pixilated
pattern, is what that means.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Could it be changed?

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It could.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.770 align:middle line:90%
It could be changed.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.010 align:middle line:84%
We had uniforms that were
part of our standard issue

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.260 align:middle line:84%
that were holographic uniforms,
in which we used for blending

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:90%
into the background.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.185 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't see a person
wearing one of these uniforms,

00:01:35.185 --> 00:01:36.060 align:middle line:90%
unless they moved it.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And then it was a very slight
blur of the background image.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.120 align:middle line:10%
It supposedly concealed our
infrared signatures, our radio

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.390 align:middle line:10%
signals, any of the
outputs that we had.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:10%
Thankfully, the quantum
entangled communications

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:10%
systems with our
nanite enhancements

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.730 align:middle line:10%
were not picked up.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.750 align:middle line:10%
And so those were,
you know, didn't

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.530 align:middle line:10%
pose a problem, but the
holographic uniform systems

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.030 align:middle line:10%
that we used out on
combat operations,

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.010 align:middle line:10%
especially in planet one posed
a problem, because once you got

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.280 align:middle line:10%
more than two of
them in a location,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.900 align:middle line:10%
the enemies could localize on
it, and were able to find us,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.850 align:middle line:10%
even though we were invisible.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.960 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: Right.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.630 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: But it had
a helmet system

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.940 align:middle line:10%
that included all of the
holographic camouflage systems

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:10%
so that, you know, basically,
the soldiers and uniforms alike

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.062 align:middle line:10%
would disappear.

00:02:38.062 --> 00:02:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So when you
say holographic,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.080 align:middle line:84%
it would be like just the
samples, the background?

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It's not that it is
projecting what's behind,

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.440 align:middle line:84%
so much as it is
creating a field that

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:84%
is slightly out of phase with
the dimension, this existence.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.810 align:middle line:84%
If you can think back to
the Philadelphia Experiment,

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.570 align:middle line:84%
in the relocation
of the naval ship,

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.910 align:middle line:84%
they phased it out of this
existence to make it disappear.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: Well, this is a
progression of that technology

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.780 align:middle line:10%
down to a man-size unit, so that
it wasn't a complete phase out,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.740 align:middle line:10%
but it was a partial phase
out, enough of a phase out

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:10%
that a light was
able to pass through.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.805 align:middle line:84%
And so the person
appeared to disappear.

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, that would give you
great advantage I would think.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: An incredible advantage.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What was it like
walking around being invisible?

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: We had some fun with it.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the when first learning
how to use it back at the FIG--

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: --some of the
really stealthy people

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.560 align:middle line:84%
could get close enough that
they could blow on your ear

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.680 align:middle line:84%
without you ever knowing
that they were there.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.571 align:middle line:84%
It's an incredible tool
and unbelievably helpful.

00:03:51.571 --> 00:03:54.070 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is that if you
know what you're looking for,

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:84%
you can see the phase
difference show up.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And you'd be able to see
it if somebody is moving,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.050 align:middle line:84%
and that included using
them while airborne, as well

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.940 align:middle line:90%
as during drops.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So I mean, if you have
this technology down to a level

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.540 align:middle line:84%
that it can make a
single man invisible,

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:84%
then there must be these
cloaking devices on ships too.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yes, if they are
able to miniaturize it

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.640 align:middle line:84%
enough down to an
individual person,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.920 align:middle line:84%
and seeing it on other vehicles,
some of the larger transport

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.810 align:middle line:84%
vehicles for equipment
and materials,

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.890 align:middle line:84%
as well as some of the tanks,
some of the other APCs,

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
they have them all the way
down on anything and everything

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.900 align:middle line:84%
that they need to have
disappear, they can use it.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.490 align:middle line:10%
Now, that also
means that it's also

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.520 align:middle line:10%
available for those
in other SSP programs,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:10%
which includes
cabal, which includes

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:56.160 align:middle line:10%
certain members of corporations,
certain members of the elites

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.440 align:middle line:10%
that want to have
access to that.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.080 align:middle line:84%
They can have access
and use it, which

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle line:84%
is what's used on some
of the aircraft that

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.600 align:middle line:84%
are flying around our
skies this very moment.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Former Naval
engineer, Bill Tompkins,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.530 align:middle line:84%
told me that if they turned
off their cloaking devices,

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.990 align:middle line:84%
you would see the whole
sky full of ships.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: All over the place.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.220 align:middle line:90%
So that's amazing.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, imagine what
a surprise that would be.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What other things
did this suit offer you

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.060 align:middle line:90%
besides invisibility?

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: This
particular modification

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.754 align:middle line:84%
was targeted specifically for
the holographic invisibility.

00:05:35.754 --> 00:05:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you have
enhanced strength with it?

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Or did it have any
protection capabilities?

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Not in addition to
the normal suit capabilities,

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.410 align:middle line:90%
which were already very high.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What does that mean?

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The standard
combat suits

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:58.790 align:middle line:84%
that we had was based on several
systems that had to be working

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.290 align:middle line:90%
in concert with each other.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.120 align:middle line:84%
The underlying system
was a base uniform,

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.790 align:middle line:84%
in which over all
of the surfaces

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:13.250 align:middle line:84%
there were a multitude of what
appeared to be seams specially

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.720 align:middle line:90%
woven together.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:84%
They are what's called a
triboelectric material, which

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.690 align:middle line:84%
is a polymerized organic
material overlaid

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.430 align:middle line:90%
with a conductor.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.530 align:middle line:10%
And the benefits
of this is that--

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.070 align:middle line:10%
and this technology
is out there now--

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:10%
the benefits is that it not
only generates electricity

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.640 align:middle line:10%
when you move, but it
also provides feedback

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.490 align:middle line:10%
from the body as
a sensor system.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.057 align:middle line:84%
So any time you'd
want to move your arm,

00:06:46.057 --> 00:06:47.890 align:middle line:84%
it would notice that
you're moving your arm,

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and the powered
armor would move,

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.690 align:middle line:84%
because if you didn't have that
feedback system on the inside,

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.070 align:middle line:90%
it would be like trying to--

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.650 align:middle line:84%
a medieval knight, walk
around with 150 pounds

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:90%
of armor on his body.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.770 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be really
cumbersome and slow.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And you'd only have the
extremely athletically fit

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and muscular guys are
the only ones wearing it

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.710 align:middle line:84%
because they're the only ones
that can carry it around.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So this system allows
the close interface

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:84%
between the line system, the
liner, and the powered armor.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.927 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And it did protect you?

00:07:20.927 --> 00:07:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It did protect us.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Must have been a certain
limit of what kind of weapons

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:25.750 align:middle line:90%
it would protect you from.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.870 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: Any small arms fire,
any conventional rifle.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: They'll bounce off,
or be absorbed, or what?

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Depending on
where it would hit.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle line:84%
If it was on an angle,
then it would bounce off.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.350 align:middle line:84%
If it hit dead on
at close range,

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.450 align:middle line:84%
then it would impact
and absorb into it.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Would you be hurt at all
by this, bruised or anything?

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: You could be bruised
if it hit in the right spot.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.740 align:middle line:90%
So it could sting you.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.699 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, yeah, you'd
know you've been hit.

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:54.498 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:07:54.498 --> 00:07:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Not only would the--

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:84%
because the feedback
systems include--

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.300 align:middle line:84%
because, you know, if you're
wearing armor and somebody is

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.930 align:middle line:84%
plinking at you,
you may hear it,

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.712 align:middle line:90%
but where is it coming from?

00:08:07.712 --> 00:08:09.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're
not going to know.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So the feedback
system on the inside

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.560 align:middle line:84%
also gives you a
physical stimulation

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.720 align:middle line:84%
in the areas that
you're taking shots.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So if I shot you
and the bullet your suit,

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.750 align:middle line:84%
would your suit know where
that bullet came from?

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It was also tracking
the ballistics of that, yeah.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you would now have
a record of where that bullet

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:29.900 align:middle line:90%
came from--

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Originated from.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: --and you'd be able
to take out that whatever.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.419 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yes, at the push of a
button, you could fire a fire

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:40.429 align:middle line:84%
and forget system that would
be a gravimetric grenade that

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:44.300 align:middle line:84%
would be able to launch itself
from a concealed position

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.820 align:middle line:84%
to find where that shot came
from, because you'd already

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.970 align:middle line:84%
have it triangulated from the
last known position anyway.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How about
Central Command?

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Would they also have
this information

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.110 align:middle line:90%
coming in from the suit?

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They would have it, as
well as all of your buddies.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.220 align:middle line:84%
So if 15 guys down
the line takes a shot,

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.310 align:middle line:84%
and it happens to
be closer to you,

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.390 align:middle line:84%
all that information is shared
amongst the combat computers.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And there are three
in each combat system.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:18.510 align:middle line:84%
There is one on the
inside at the chest level.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
two in the back.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's at the lower area
of the spine, out of the way

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.880 align:middle line:84%
as much as possible,
so it provides you

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.400 align:middle line:90%
a triple redundant system.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So all of the systems update
each other and communicate.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.930 align:middle line:10%
And it's important,
because the visors,

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.330 align:middle line:10%
you don't have any glass or
openings or much to like you

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.280 align:middle line:10%
see in Hollywood
with the fancy eye.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.070 align:middle line:84%
There's none of
that, because those

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.950 align:middle line:84%
are weak points
for ballistics that

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.250 align:middle line:90%
allow for a point of entry.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's a solid shield
in front of you.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you're seeing
is all digitally generated.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.359 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: So anything
that you want to see--

00:10:02.359 --> 00:10:04.840 align:middle line:10%
and you have full vision
of the combat, combat

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.060 align:middle line:10%
field through smoke,
through night,

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:11.960 align:middle line:10%
through enhanced environments,
reduced environments,

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.550 align:middle line:10%
microgravity, environments
that are off planet.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
training we did on Mars

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.050 align:middle line:84%
was involved with harsh
environment training in a suit.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Most of the four
months I spent on Mars

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:29.240 align:middle line:84%
was what we called
life in a suit,

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.819 align:middle line:84%
because we spent the entire
time training in the suit.

00:10:31.819 --> 00:10:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: At first, it was
uncomfortable, naturally.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Oh, it was terrible.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.600 align:middle line:10%
How much did it weigh,
the whole suit, the helmet

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.400 align:middle line:10%
and everything?

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The whole suit
was about 200 pounds.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: 200 pounds?

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.814 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Empty.

00:10:42.814 --> 00:10:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: You're kidding.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.659 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I mean, you're dragging
200 pounds around on you?

00:10:46.659 --> 00:10:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, you're
not dragging it,

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.900 align:middle line:90%
because it's powered.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So it feels like you're
not wearing anything.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just like
you're wearing a jacket.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.438 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And how is it powered?

00:10:57.438 --> 00:10:59.780 align:middle line:90%
Is there a battery pack or?

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It has its own
battery pack power supply.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And it is an anti-matter
power pack system.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's a triple
protected redundant system.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, if one
of them fails, you

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.390 align:middle line:84%
don't want to be
anywhere near it.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.570 align:middle line:84%
But they do have a
lifespan that lasts

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:84%
about a week between
power cell changes.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And that's
at full combat.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And you know, at first,
we were like, yeah,

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.760 align:middle line:90%
sure it lasts a week.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe it.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.690 align:middle line:84%
After living through
it and seeing it,

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.320 align:middle line:84%
you get confidence
in the systems.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.100 align:middle line:84%
The self-contained
breathing system

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.860 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to
a rebreather system

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.090 align:middle line:84%
that you'd see on a scuba, in
which it takes the same air.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.420 align:middle line:10%
And it may inject a little bit
of new, but most of the times

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.530 align:middle line:10%
it's scrubbing.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:53.930 align:middle line:84%
It has several modes of
operation, where you can run

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:56.160 align:middle line:90%
in complete self-containment.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.950 align:middle line:84%
You can run with outside
air being filtered.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.080 align:middle line:84%
You can run with
unfiltered outside air.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a number
of different ways

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.130 align:middle line:90%
that it has its own systems.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.730 align:middle line:10%
It can recharge its system,
if for instance, you're

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.190 align:middle line:10%
in a pressurized
atmosphere, and you

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.700 align:middle line:10%
don't want to use your
self-contained oxygen,

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.460 align:middle line:10%
then you can switch to refill
mode, in which it will start

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.690 align:middle line:10%
the process of trying to refill
the tanks, the onboard tanks

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.220 align:middle line:10%
that you've got.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So that when you go into say a
zero-g or an out of atmosphere

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.540 align:middle line:90%
condition, you have full tanks.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:90%
And we could set it up.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's what
I did, and most of us

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:41.160 align:middle line:84%
did, was set it up for
automatically going

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.410 align:middle line:84%
through these processes
for maintenance,

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:48.270 align:middle line:84%
for recharging, for reminding
us, you know, hey, look,

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going through
this recharge process.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.315 align:middle line:90%
OK, and then you move on.

00:12:52.315 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did the suit interact
with your own nanites?

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It sure did.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the
communication protocols

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
that we had, part of
the learning process

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.050 align:middle line:84%
that we went through
with the nanites involved

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.820 align:middle line:90%
the communications.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:10%
And you didn't have to talk
in order to communicate,

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:17.790 align:middle line:10%
but what it did require is
focusing on a particular spot

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:10%
to enable that communications.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.360 align:middle line:10%
And it was a particular spot in
the brain that you focused on.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.780 align:middle line:84%
You don't think about
it when you're talking.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.690 align:middle line:84%
It's an automated process,
but the same thing

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:33.270 align:middle line:84%
happens when you're
communicating with somebody,

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.570 align:middle line:90%
and talking to them.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you're saying
you're almost telepathically

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.160 align:middle line:90%
commanding the suit?

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, the
communications, for instance,

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.580 align:middle line:84%
in calling higher and
reporting a combat,

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.560 align:middle line:84%
or talking to them
to get resupplies,

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.660 align:middle line:84%
we had to learn how to use
that communication system.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that was
not an easy task,

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:84%
because you have to
focus on that one spot.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to turn
down all of the other thoughts

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and focus just on the words that
you're going to communicate.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And so in the
beginning, it's kind

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.340 align:middle line:84%
of like getting an auto-correct
inappropriate text.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right, the error message.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It puts the wrong
things into your text

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.100 align:middle line:90%
that you don't want.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, the communications
were like that.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, and the
last thing you want

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.780 align:middle line:84%
is to be sending the
equivalent of a mental text

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.720 align:middle line:84%
to command that has
just how you feel

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.530 align:middle line:84%
about your commander
in the text.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So we had to learn
how to control that, and not

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:84%
send extraneous information
in the message stream.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Interesting.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Do you think they're
using this suit technology

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.760 align:middle line:90%
in the military today?

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I think in special
access programs, you bet.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.360 align:middle line:90%
Without a doubt.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: There could be somebody
invisible walking around

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.290 align:middle line:90%
even here right now?

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:55.099 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:14:55.099 --> 00:14:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow, that's scary.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: All over the
planet, it's kind of scary.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah, it is.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: But, you
know, they still

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.240 align:middle line:84%
have rules that they
have to play by.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And I'm very
thankful for that.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.270 align:middle line:90%
But yes.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Are they in the conventional
military and being

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.980 align:middle line:84%
used in the
conventional military?

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.260 align:middle line:84%
No, because we still have that
whole elite separation thing,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.160 align:middle line:84%
is we've got all
the good things,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.920 align:middle line:84%
and you're not allowed to have
them, because we're special

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.240 align:middle line:90%
and you're not.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.130 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: So the weapons,
are they connected

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.670 align:middle line:10%
to communications within
the nanites within you,

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.750 align:middle line:10%
and the suit itself?

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Some of the
weapons are neural command.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.760 align:middle line:10%
Some of them are
physical commands,

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.400 align:middle line:10%
or physical initiations.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.100 align:middle line:84%
There are a wide range
of weapon systems

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.580 align:middle line:90%
that we used in the SSP program.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.790 align:middle line:84%
My unit, the third
Panzer division,

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.910 align:middle line:90%
we had anti-matter explosives.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to go
over a little bit more

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:58.220 align:middle line:84%
on anti-matter, because the
first article that I could find

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle line:84%
publicly about the modern
military using anti-matter

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:08.660 align:middle line:90%
was in 1986.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.450 align:middle line:84%
That's the first article
that I could find out

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:12.805 align:middle line:90%
in the public view.

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:15.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you recall, that's
the year that the message was

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:84%
sent to the cabal
by the Germans,

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.720 align:middle line:84%
when they found out
that their mind wipe

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.110 align:middle line:90%
technology was stolen.

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Very shortly after
that article came out,

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.550 align:middle line:84%
orders came down to that
company on that base,

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.860 align:middle line:84%
and incidentally, a
lot of the research

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.190 align:middle line:84%
was being done at Eglin
Air Force Base in Florida.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There was a sequester
of information that came down,

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:40.920 align:middle line:90%
no more talking about it.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.860 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.240 align:middle line:90%
So '86.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.100 align:middle line:10%
Anti-matter, to give you an idea
of the power, the reason why

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:57.160 align:middle line:10%
it is so energetic is
that every gram of matter

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:02.380 align:middle line:10%
has an equal and opposite
gram of anti-matter.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.740 align:middle line:84%
The beauty, if you will
pardon the expression,

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.700 align:middle line:84%
of an anti-matter
explosion is that the mass

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.240 align:middle line:84%
of both the matter
and anti-matter

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.940 align:middle line:90%
is 100% converted to energy.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.240 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that mean?

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.589 align:middle line:84%
To give you an example,
conventional modern nuclear

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:29.750 align:middle line:84%
weapons only operate at
about a 10% efficiency.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The largest nuke in
the United States's arsenal

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:40.480 align:middle line:84%
only works at about
10% efficient, 10%.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:47.020 align:middle line:10%
Anti-matter explosions operate
on a 100% efficiency rate.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.720 align:middle line:10%
The little boy bomb that
was used on Hiroshima,

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:55.240 align:middle line:10%
it was about 10 feet long,
weighed about 10,000 pounds,

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.470 align:middle line:10%
28 inches in diameter,
and it was 15 kilotons.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:02.170 align:middle line:84%
The amount of anti-matter
needed to generate

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:05.350 align:middle line:84%
the same amount of
explosion you could get out

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:11.060 align:middle line:84%
of the size of a number two
pencil eraser, half a gram

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.430 align:middle line:84%
would generate the same
amount of 15 kilotons

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:14.510 align:middle line:90%
of explosive power.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you have like
a projectile that you

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.070 align:middle line:90%
could shoot these things with?

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Well, the way--

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:26.210 align:middle line:84%
the problem with anti-matter
is that anything that comes

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.800 align:middle line:90%
in contact with it--

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Boom.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: --boom.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:34.190 align:middle line:10%
You know, modern nuclear
weapons are fail safe,

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.590 align:middle line:10%
because the amount of
technology required just

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:43.904 align:middle line:10%
to get the plutonium or
uranium to detonate--

00:18:43.904 --> 00:18:44.820 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: Reach critical.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: --reach critical
mass is a tremendous amount

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:48.610 align:middle line:90%
of technology.

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yes, it is.

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It's got to be
fired all at the same time.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:90%
We won't get into the physics.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Extremely difficult
to build a nuclear bomb.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.924 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It's really hard
to get it to go off.

00:18:56.924 --> 00:18:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a very
fail safe weapons

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.310 align:middle line:84%
platform, modern
nuclear weapons.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Anti-matter is
just the opposite.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a fail dangerous
proposition,

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.636 align:middle line:84%
because any time
you come in contact

00:19:09.636 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:84%
with anti-matter
and matter, it's

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:12.270 align:middle line:90%
going to get the explosion.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.790 align:middle line:84%
So it means that it
has to have some type

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:90%
of magnetic containment.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I see.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: You can't allow
it to touch anything.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:24.560 align:middle line:10%
And to give you an
example, 50 billionths

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:32.270 align:middle line:10%
of a gram of anti-matter
is enough explosive power

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:10%
that's equal to about
4,000 pounds of TNT.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.860 align:middle line:84%
That's how much was used
on the Murray building

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:39.910 align:middle line:90%
in Oklahoma City.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: Right.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:45.650 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: To give you an idea,
50 billionths of a gram.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And so even amounts smaller than
you can see are significant.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And so what they have
is they've developed

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:59.750 align:middle line:84%
a anti-matter containment
that does not require power,

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:03.470 align:middle line:84%
that is essentially a
stationary magnet system.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.851 align:middle line:90%
And the ones that we had--

00:20:05.851 --> 00:20:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And they're very small.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: And they're very small.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.755 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if you
were able to open it--

00:20:09.755 --> 00:20:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You wouldn't
even see one.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, if you
were able to open

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.910 align:middle line:84%
one of these
containment systems up

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.724 align:middle line:84%
to look for the anti-matter
inside, you wouldn't see it,

00:20:16.724 --> 00:20:17.890 align:middle line:90%
because they're microscopic.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So the systems
that we used were--

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.360 align:middle line:84%
we called them Cheerios,
because they were

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.970 align:middle line:90%
little toruses, real small.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And so it had a very specific
amount of anti-matter in it.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the containment
system's like a Cheerio?

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: A torus.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.085 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: A torus, and
was it going around?

00:20:36.085 --> 00:20:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Oh, they
were stationary.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.260 align:middle line:90%
They were static.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Was it inside the hole?

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.779 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It was inside
the hollowed out--

00:20:41.779 --> 00:20:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So sort of like a
centrifuge or something.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And so they were able
to contain the field.

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Was it racing
around in that thing?

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.590 align:middle line:90%
Don't know.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Don't know.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You ought to
open one and find out.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Not the hard way.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:56.720 align:middle line:84%
These containment
systems had to be

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.700 align:middle line:84%
cracked at a very specific point
in order to get them to open.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was on the inside
seam of the inner torus.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.060 align:middle line:90%
You could step on it.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.480 align:middle line:90%
You could hit it with a hammer.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.280 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't open.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Nothing.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The containment
wouldn't breach.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.870 align:middle line:10%
If you activated it at
a very particular spot,

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:17.430 align:middle line:10%
that would breach
the containment

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.263 align:middle line:10%
and allow the anti-matter
to come into play.

00:21:19.263 --> 00:21:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So there was a geometry
that you had to activate.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And there was a certain
way that it had to be--

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.460 align:middle line:84%
the containment
had to be broken.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Then, once you
break it, then boom,

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.930 align:middle line:84%
you get the magic
that anti-matter is.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you would like fire
this thing and then it would--

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.230 align:middle line:84%
when it hit the thing
it would break open?

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, we didn't
use them as projectiles.

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: You didn't?

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:42.665 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:21:42.665 --> 00:21:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Were they like grenades?

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: We used them as
stationary, or emplacement

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.860 align:middle line:90%
grenades, or bombs.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.120 align:middle line:90%
We used them in mortars.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.580 align:middle line:90%
We had them in artillery rounds.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.400 align:middle line:90%
We used them for--

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.295 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I see.

00:21:55.295 --> 00:21:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So you'd lay out a
bunch of mortars knowing

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.359 align:middle line:90%
if they were advancing at you.

00:21:58.359 --> 00:21:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Land mines.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:21:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Mines.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.690 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: --as they step on it.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Command detonation,
motion activated.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Gotcha.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: So that was how.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.770 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have the technology
to redevelop and redesign it

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:11.820 align:middle line:90%
into a projectile.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.675 align:middle line:90%
If we did, we would have.

00:22:13.675 --> 00:22:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Was that the
first time that you

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.580 align:middle line:90%
saw the anti-matter technology?

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I had seen
it during training.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yes.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And had used
it and tested it

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and had been able to set some
off to get experience with it.

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:27.570 align:middle line:84%
They want you to get experience,
and to gain confidence

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:31.400 align:middle line:84%
in their containment systems,
because when you're going

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and all you need is something
the size of a number two eraser

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:38.000 align:middle line:84%
to create a 15 kiloton
nuclear explosion,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.820 align:middle line:84%
people are a little
worried, you know?

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Want to be very careful.

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:41.869 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Be very careful.

00:22:41.869 --> 00:22:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
first things they did

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.370 align:middle line:84%
was they brought it
into the classroom

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:49.380 align:middle line:84%
and hit it with a hammer, the
Cheerios, to show us look,

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.620 align:middle line:84%
these containment
systems are solid.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.520 align:middle line:84%
You have to hit it at just the
right place at the right amount

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.320 align:middle line:90%
of pressure.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I'm not hitting
one with a hammer.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I'm pretty sure,
at least later when

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I was training, it
was a dummy unit,

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.670 align:middle line:84%
but I'm pretty sure that
it wasn't a live unit,

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:07.170 align:middle line:84%
but it got the point
across, is that look,

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.720 align:middle line:90%
these things are pretty tough.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.845 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to be able
to break them open with

00:23:10.845 --> 00:23:13.210 align:middle line:90%
just your bare hands.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:17.390 align:middle line:84%
But the use of anti-matter
at that particular time

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:21.540 align:middle line:84%
on that planet, was
what turned it for us.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.470 align:middle line:10%
We had more advanced
weapons systems,

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:27.350 align:middle line:10%
some of the more
advanced gravimetrics.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:28.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What's a gravimetrics?

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It's a great question.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:35.600 align:middle line:84%
If you can imagine accelerating
the gravity within a field

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.160 align:middle line:84%
up to several
thousand gravities,

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.020 align:middle line:90%
what would happen to an object?

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.572 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: It would get very heavy.

00:23:40.572 --> 00:23:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It would
implode on itself.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yes.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And so what
we have were crew

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.960 align:middle line:84%
served weapons that
shot a one inch diameter

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.156 align:middle line:90%
beam that did that.

00:23:50.156 --> 00:23:54.200 align:middle line:10%
And so any biologicals that
it came in contact with

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.120 align:middle line:10%
would essentially,
implode from that point.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Sort of
like a black hole,

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.100 align:middle line:84%
a little miniaturized
black hole?

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, that's a
good way to think of it.

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So it sucked everything
into kind of a dimension.

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:08.010 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: It would cause
it to self-collapse.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:11.870 align:middle line:84%
All the atoms and
molecules would--

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, anywhere
that it would pass through.

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: In a single point.

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:16.800 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: At a single point.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, those were
crew served weapons, again,

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.750 align:middle line:84%
something we weren't
allowed to use,

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.250 align:middle line:84%
but we weren't
allowed to use it.

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:26.790 align:middle line:84%
They were too afraid, because
they are crew served weapons.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.710 align:middle line:90%
They are man portable.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:30.900 align:middle line:84%
They could have fallen
into the wrong hands.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And they were too afraid of that
kind of level of technology.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So they held them
back and used them

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.790 align:middle line:84%
on strategic division
defensive perimeters, or areas

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:44.820 align:middle line:84%
that they kept a tight
close watch, in which there

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.950 align:middle line:90%
were no indigs allowed.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:48.420 align:middle line:90%
Those were areas that they--

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:51.370 align:middle line:84%
defensive positions that they
were allowed to use them in.

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:53.822 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Again, to hide the
technology from the indigenous.

00:24:53.822 --> 00:24:54.780 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: OK, so what did it
look like when one of these

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:57.420 align:middle line:90%
went off?

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Did you witness one?

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, you
can't see the beam,

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:06.120 align:middle line:84%
but our nanite enhancements
allowed us to attune

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.950 align:middle line:90%
to the right frequency.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:09.140 align:middle line:90%
There are two settings.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:12.210 align:middle line:84%
There's the first setting, which
fires an infrared beam that

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.430 align:middle line:84%
allows you to see
where you're shooting,

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.160 align:middle line:84%
similar to the infrared
beams that they have

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.910 align:middle line:84%
on modern and
conventional weapons

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:22.440 align:middle line:84%
that you can see
with night vision,

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.080 align:middle line:84%
but you take the night vision
off, you can't see a thing.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Very similar to that.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.646 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Use them in
Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:25:27.646 --> 00:25:28.787 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:25:28.787 --> 00:25:30.620 align:middle line:84%
That allows you to see
where you're shooting

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.570 align:middle line:90%
without anybody else seeing it.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:36.950 align:middle line:84%
This system uses that
infrared beam as a sighting,

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.100 align:middle line:84%
so that, you know,
instead of a visual laser,

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.570 align:middle line:90%
they use an infrared laser.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And we all had
the ability to tune

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.357 align:middle line:84%
into that frequency,
so we could see it.

00:25:46.357 --> 00:25:47.156 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:25:47.156 --> 00:25:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And so you know,
other people, other humans,

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.032 align:middle line:84%
other soldiers, civilians,
they couldn't see that,

00:25:52.032 --> 00:25:53.240 align:middle line:90%
unless they had night vision.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And that wasn't a
technology they had.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.030 align:middle line:84%
The second stage of the weapon
was the actual firing of it.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And you had night
vision in your suits also?

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It was built
into our nanites.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So you guys were awesome.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: But you know, since
you can't see with your eyes,

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.000 align:middle line:84%
it was built into the suit
as part of the sensor system.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:13.670 align:middle line:84%
You have the first
setting, the sighted.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The sighting, and the
second setting is the firing.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: There was a
certain amount of time

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.190 align:middle line:84%
that you had to wait
in between shots.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.740 align:middle line:84%
You could get two or
three seconds shot off,

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.557 align:middle line:84%
and as many targets as you
could hit in that time.

00:26:27.557 --> 00:26:28.640 align:middle line:90%
And then you had to wait--

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you use
conventional weapons at all?

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: You did?

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: We did.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So bullets and--

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Mm-hmm.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Standard chemical
projectile weapons.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.280 align:middle line:84%
What percentage did you use
of those weapons as opposed

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.900 align:middle line:90%
to these exotic weapons?

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: We used the standard
conventional weapons

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.960 align:middle line:84%
because, you know, again, our
interactions with the indigs

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:48.860 align:middle line:90%
was to train them.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:49.660 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And so 99%
of the time, we

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.610 align:middle line:84%
were using standard
conventional weapons, which

00:26:55.610 --> 00:27:00.680 align:middle line:84%
were the chemical explosives,
projectile type, either gas

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.184 align:middle line:90%
fed, gas recoil.

00:27:03.184 --> 00:27:05.600 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple of other
systems that I won't get into.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did the suit
protect your hearing

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.855 align:middle line:90%
from these conventional weapons?

00:27:08.855 --> 00:27:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It did.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: That's nice.

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It did.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:12.430 align:middle line:90%
That was nice.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.490 align:middle line:90%
I had it built in.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:16.540 align:middle line:84%
They toned it down a lot,
so you'd hear the pop.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And you were
able to get to a point

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.320 align:middle line:84%
where you could recognize
different sounds

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.680 align:middle line:90%
and different weapons.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Sure.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Did the suit help
you with recoil?

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It did, number
one, because you're

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.780 align:middle line:84%
adding a couple of hundred
pounds to your mass.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Sure.

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So you know, as a
150-160 pound adult male,

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.400 align:middle line:84%
you're now 360 pounds
with the suit on.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.215 align:middle line:84%
And so you're not going to
be seeing or experiencing

00:27:44.215 --> 00:27:45.590 align:middle line:84%
nearly the same
amount of recoil.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.684 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:27:47.684 --> 00:27:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The standard
issue weapons

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.480 align:middle line:84%
that we had were
the plasma rifle

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:56.900 align:middle line:84%
and what we called
the Gauss rifle, which

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.280 align:middle line:90%
are electromagnetic coils.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.870 align:middle line:10%
Pulser rifles is
what we called them.

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:01.520 align:middle line:90%
What are those like?

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.495 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:28:02.495 --> 00:28:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The Pulser is not really
expressing what comes out.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.530 align:middle line:84%
That is an expression
of the pulse

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:12.730 align:middle line:90%
of magnetics down the barrel.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can find
information on this type

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.775 align:middle line:90%
of technology conventionally.

00:28:16.775 --> 00:28:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: It's like
compressed plasma?

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:23.660 align:middle line:10%
What it is is the
Pulser rifle is a series

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:25.430 align:middle line:10%
of coils along the barrel.

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That is powered by
a extremely high amperage

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:36.190 align:middle line:84%
battery that fits into the
handle, advancement materials,

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:37.850 align:middle line:90%
advanced science.

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.660 align:middle line:84%
It has a clear
crystalline structure.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's filled
with a pink liquid.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: We weren't on a need
to know as far as the materials

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and how it was made,
and don't break them.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And when these
pulses would hit whatever,

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:53.470 align:middle line:90%
what would happen?

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:56.950 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: Well, what would happen
is the specially designed

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:02.370 align:middle line:10%
rounds that went into it, both
we had pistols and rifles,

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:05.940 align:middle line:10%
those rounds were about
the diameter of a number

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.410 align:middle line:10%
two pencil lead.

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:09.360 align:middle line:90%
They were sharpened at one end.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.650 align:middle line:90%
And they were hollowed out.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:13.170 align:middle line:84%
They were made of a
non-corrosive, magnetic

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:13.970 align:middle line:90%
material.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Oh, so they
would actually--

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.440 align:middle line:84%
the pulse would shoot
out a physical--

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Ballistic, yes.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: --object.

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It would
send out an object

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.835 align:middle line:90%
at incredible velocities.

00:29:24.835 --> 00:29:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I mean, like partial
fraction light speed.

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So I mean,
you could turn it up,

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:35.680 align:middle line:90%
but we had to dampen them down.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.684 align:middle line:84%
And they were governored,
so that we didn't--

00:29:38.684 --> 00:29:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: They're too damaging.

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: --launch
things into orbit.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.393 align:middle line:84%
You know, they didn't
want the Navy to start

00:29:43.393 --> 00:29:45.260 align:middle line:90%
taking shots from the ground.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:50.560 align:middle line:84%
So they had them governored down
to a more manageable velocity.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.980 align:middle line:84%
The science behind
these particular rounds

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:58.540 align:middle line:84%
was that we had a standard round
and we had an enhanced round.

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:04.650 align:middle line:10%
The standard round, upon impact
it would compress and mushroom,

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:08.560 align:middle line:10%
which something the size
of a number two pencil

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.620 align:middle line:10%
became something
the size of a 38.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.500 align:middle line:90%
So it was more than enough.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And they generally
had enough velocity

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:19.960 align:middle line:84%
that they would
pass clean through.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.180 align:middle line:90%
So they were damaging enough.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:29.230 align:middle line:10%
The enhanced rounds, if you can
imagine a miniature umbrella,

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.180 align:middle line:10%
from the outside they
don't look any different

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.670 align:middle line:10%
than the standard
rounds, but when it hits,

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:40.550 align:middle line:10%
instead of mushrooming down into
a mass, the umbrella opens up.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:42.635 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: It opens up
as it's traveling?

00:30:42.635 --> 00:30:43.510 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: When it hits.

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:44.336 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Oh, I see.

00:30:44.336 --> 00:30:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: When it hits.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.045 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So it's
activated when it hits.

00:30:46.045 --> 00:30:46.961 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It activates--

00:30:46.961 --> 00:30:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: --and bores
a hole I guess.

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:52.420 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: It opens the umbrella,
because if you think--

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.270 align:middle line:10%
if you're pushing an
umbrella aerodynamically

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.970 align:middle line:10%
through the air, and
then when it hits then

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:02.100 align:middle line:10%
the umbrella opens
up from the impact.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And even though
the tissue or armor

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:08.340 align:middle line:84%
is going to push back
on that umbrella,

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.410 align:middle line:84%
it's still large
enough that it creates

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.940 align:middle line:84%
enough damage that's equivalent
to like a 50 caliber.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.944 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So I mean,
it is devastating.

00:31:15.944 --> 00:31:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And again, these
things are accurate out

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:18.814 align:middle line:90%
to several thousand meters.

00:31:18.814 --> 00:31:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Is this the
weapon that you

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.560 align:middle line:84%
were using when you were
first fighting the werewolves?

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: No, they wouldn't
let us use that either.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: They wouldn't let you.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:25.730 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:28.350 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: That would have been
the absolute best thing to use,

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:32.040 align:middle line:10%
because we could use those
in our fully automatics.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.895 align:middle line:84%
Same thing on the next
planet, Paladus 3.

00:31:35.895 --> 00:31:39.679 align:middle line:84%
It would have been
a game changer.

00:31:39.679 --> 00:31:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: But they weren't
interested in that.

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They weren't
interested in that.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Pulse and a plasma,
is there a difference

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:46.220 align:middle line:90%
between a pulse and a plasma?

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: There is.

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.990 align:middle line:84%
The plasma rifle is based
on a different concept.

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:54.310 align:middle line:10%
It utilizes magnetics
and magnetic coils,

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:59.530 align:middle line:10%
but what it does is instead of
ejecting a projectile at very

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:02.500 align:middle line:10%
high velocities
along a barrel, it

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:10.930 align:middle line:10%
projects a small,
spherical piece of metal.

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:15.050 align:middle line:84%
If you can imagine a
very advanced material

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:19.270 align:middle line:84%
BB, would be a good
equivalent for it.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:23.140 align:middle line:84%
What it does is,
inside the unit,

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:27.580 align:middle line:84%
the magnetics heated up to a
point, where it is glowing.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.610 align:middle line:84%
The next process is
it purges the barrel

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:38.110 align:middle line:84%
with a noble gas, nitrogen, so
that this now glowing almost

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:42.160 align:middle line:84%
on fire ball doesn't
catch fire in the barrel.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.130 align:middle line:10%
So as soon as this ball comes
out the end of the barrel

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.800 align:middle line:10%
it's on fire.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And oh, by the way, it's now
moving at a very high velocity,

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:51.490 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So you get these fire
balls that you're

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:59.050 align:middle line:84%
able to shoot that are
basically molten lead.

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:01.730 align:middle line:10%
Being able to shoot
a plasma ball,

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:04.500 align:middle line:10%
that's why they call
them plasma rifles.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Devastating.

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Devastating.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:08.136 align:middle line:90%
Devastating.

00:33:08.136 --> 00:33:12.700 align:middle line:10%
And the high rate of speed
for the rate of fire, nothing,

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:16.590 align:middle line:10%
nothing conventional compares
to either of them, as far as

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:19.490 align:middle line:10%
what it is capable of doing
and how quickly it can lay down

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:20.660 align:middle line:10%
metal.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.140 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: Wow, sure wouldn't want
to be at the receiving end.

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.556 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: You don't want to be
on the receiving end of that.

00:33:25.556 --> 00:33:29.190 align:middle line:84%
There are more weapon
systems that we can go into.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:31.020 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
do you want to--

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:36.430 align:middle line:84%
I think there's probably one
more that's worth discussing.

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:39.230 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: Go ahead.

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:44.330 align:middle line:10%
>>RICE: The last one is what was
referred to as the static gun,

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:51.320 align:middle line:10%
the CONPDDP, C-O-N-P-D-D-P,
a condensate phase difference

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.700 align:middle line:10%
diffuser platform.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And what it was is it resembled
one of the old television

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.710 align:middle line:90%
cameras.

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:01.620 align:middle line:84%
That's what this
thing looked like.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.590 align:middle line:84%
It was about the size
of a small freezer,

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:07.530 align:middle line:84%
about four feet by three
feet by 2 1/2 feet,

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:11.420 align:middle line:84%
multiple edges and
ledges and cooling fins.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:15.469 align:middle line:84%
This thing was powered
by its own power system.

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And what it did was it
created an area in front of it

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.810 align:middle line:90%
out to about a half a mile.

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:27.180 align:middle line:84%
This system is only limited
by the amount of power

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:27.980 align:middle line:90%
going to it.

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:30.199 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is
it causes anything

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:34.130 align:middle line:84%
within its path to lose
cohesion at the atomic level.

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:37.370 align:middle line:84%
It basically reverts
everything and anything back

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:39.650 align:middle line:84%
into its native and
original components.

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So it disintegrates it.

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Disintegrates it.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Anything that is a solid,
anything that's a gas.

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.429 align:middle line:84%
We called it the static
gun, because part

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:53.560 align:middle line:84%
of the interface with the
beam itself and the air is

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.650 align:middle line:84%
it caused the air to of
course, disassociate.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And the process was a
very low static sound.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Another byproduct was
light from the beam.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:13.610 align:middle line:84%
The beam itself was a
10 inch diameter beam.

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:15.870 align:middle line:90%
This was a divisional weapon.

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:18.200 align:middle line:84%
This was not something
that was man portable.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.590 align:middle line:84%
There were only five
of them in my division.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was a
preserve, and the other four

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:27.410 align:middle line:84%
were for divisional
defense, which

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:30.020 align:middle line:84%
means that the main
general's headquarters were

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.370 align:middle line:90%
defended by this unit.

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: This was the
ultimate defense.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah,
there was no armor.

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.270 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that was
capable of stopping it.

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:40.820 align:middle line:84%
The Navy had even
bigger units, even

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:44.150 align:middle line:84%
larger ones that were capable
of longer distances and larger

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:46.400 align:middle line:90%
diameter beams.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.345 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How far away could it
hit something and do damage?

00:35:49.345 --> 00:35:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Technically, there
is an infinite distance.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:53.000 align:middle line:84%
You're only limited
by the amount of power

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.001 align:middle line:90%
that you had to feed it.

00:35:54.001 --> 00:35:55.833 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And the curve
of the planet, I guess.

00:35:55.833 --> 00:35:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Right.

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: That is fascinating.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how anyone can
say that this could be made up.

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:05.810 align:middle line:10%
I suppose somebody will,
but the attention to detail

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:07.610 align:middle line:10%
that you present is amazing.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I suspect that
there will be those that

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:12.030 align:middle line:90%
probably accuse me of that.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:14.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm just not that creative.

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.567 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: No, and neither
am I. Anyway, Jason,

00:36:16.567 --> 00:36:18.150 align:middle line:84%
it's been really a
pleasure having you

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:21.730 align:middle line:84%
on, talking about the cool
suits and weapons that you used.

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:22.530 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:23.863 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Thank you for having me.

00:36:23.863 --> 00:36:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really looking forward
to expounding on it again

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.400 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is all
about disclosure.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: It is.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.353 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.

00:36:31.353 --> 00:36:33.157 align:middle line:90%


00:36:33.157 --> 00:36:36.420 align:middle line:10%
>>ANNOUNCER: Coming this season
on "Cosmic Disclosure," where

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.180 align:middle line:10%
people share their clandestine
involvement with government

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:43.310 align:middle line:10%
agencies, the military,
and secret space programs.

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>>: So these things are
all back-reverse engineered

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.870 align:middle line:84%
technologies, and
intelligence, and ideas from

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:50.580 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials.

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That's why they
call it the awakening,

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:56.570 align:middle line:84%
because it's coming to realize
that all the things that you

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:59.940 align:middle line:84%
are lied to and controlled
and manipulated about, we do

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.160 align:middle line:90%
have a choice.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>: Humans have developed this
broad bandwidth of emotion.

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:08.940 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these beings, they
have the same emotion we do,

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.090 align:middle line:90%
but it's more intense.

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:20.939 align:middle line:90%
