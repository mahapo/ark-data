[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:20.140 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today on Cosmic
Disclosure, we are with Tim,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.530 align:middle line:84%
who is speaking with
us from Germany.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:84%
that's related to
extraterrestrial life.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.560 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Thank you
for having me again.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, what
is the Council of 7?

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.900 align:middle line:10%
>> TIM: So the Council of 7 is
actually a diplomatic but also

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:49.520 align:middle line:10%
military group that comes from
an ET presence that is actually

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.490 align:middle line:10%
heading down information
from Level 7 consciousness,

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.300 align:middle line:10%
which is super
high consciousness.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.080 align:middle line:84%
If we're thinking
about timelines,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.540 align:middle line:84%
it's quite far away from us, so
reaching down those information

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.970 align:middle line:84%
to human groups but also
quite a number of ET groups.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Before
we discuss Level 7,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.890 align:middle line:84%
who are the groups that are
communicating with right now?

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Every group on Earth,
mainstream group or advanced

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.690 align:middle line:84%
group that has an arrow symbol
in their logo is actually part

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.230 align:middle line:84%
of Council 7, Council of 7, or
communicating with the Council

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.030 align:middle line:90%
of 7.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:84%
This is true for quite a number
of space-related agencies

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.220 align:middle line:84%
in the US and China,
Germany, Europe as well,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.190 align:middle line:90%
and you name it.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So it can be found all
over the Earth actually.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now, Tim, are you
saying these are the human

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.260 align:middle line:84%
groups with the arrow or
A-shaped logo and many space

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.080 align:middle line:84%
programs around the world
and not specifically

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.860 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials?

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So the original
source of the Council of 7,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.360 align:middle line:84%
it's a very high intelligence
ET and they give information

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.110 align:middle line:84%
and strategic orders and advices
down to a pyramid shape in that

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.690 align:middle line:84%
way, down to different
other groups.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And you will find the logo
and this very specific arrow--

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.060 align:middle line:84%
it's very significant
in that way,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.370 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find
it all over the place.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And basically, seemingly
unrelated organizations

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.580 align:middle line:84%
that might even geopolitically
oppose each other

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.397 align:middle line:90%
are all sharing the same symbol.

00:02:38.397 --> 00:02:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Let's start at the top
of the pyramid and get a step

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.770 align:middle line:84%
by step breakdown of all
the lifeforms involved.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: OK, so the top of the
pyramid is, again, a very high,

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:90%
ET presence.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Officially, the only
life form that we

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:84%
know that exists in
this universe right

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:84%
now at Level 7
consciousness, which

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.320 align:middle line:84%
is if you want to define
it, the God consciousness.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.630 align:middle line:84%
It could also be put into
timeline terms if you want,

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.630 align:middle line:84%
and then it's something
that is very, very distant

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.650 align:middle line:84%
and far away from what we're
currently experiencing but it's

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.810 align:middle line:84%
still drawing in those timelines
that we're experiencing right

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:20.610 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.700 align:middle line:84%
From our perspective,
this ET presence

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.270 align:middle line:84%
forms around what we
perceive as Saturn.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, why do you use
the term God consciousness

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.750 align:middle line:84%
or source if it is something
that evolves as in the example

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.710 align:middle line:84%
of Level 7 emerging from
something more refined?

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.940 align:middle line:90%
How do you understand that?

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So basically, in
the beginning of all those

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.720 align:middle line:84%
projects, we were assuming that
the universe only has octave

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.590 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness levels.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.760 align:middle line:84%
So each consciousness
level was a model

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.530 align:middle line:84%
to refine and to declare
on which kind of stage

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.240 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness you are.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Usually, we only Level
3 consciousness beings

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.630 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, but of
course it goes higher.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.950 align:middle line:84%
But we also came across quite
recently, the assumption

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.900 align:middle line:84%
that there are even more
layers than Level 7, Level 8.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.420 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it's
super hard to define

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.990 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen in
those distant far reality.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So basically at Level
8 consciousness,

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.340 align:middle line:84%
everything seems to set up
into quite a new universe

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.610 align:middle line:84%
So Level 7 consciousness is
even higher than being 6.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And mostly the ultimate
moment of the story

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.600 align:middle line:84%
that we are perceiving
right now in this universe.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.950 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I want to
note, too, is that something

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:53.730 align:middle line:84%
that we also described as
Christ consciousness is also--

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.050 align:middle line:84%
at least this is what the
Zeta Reticuli and the Greys

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:84%
define as coming from Saturn,
from this Council of 7.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's those biblical
stories that we

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.760 align:middle line:84%
have around Christ and the
Christ consciousness in a very

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:84%
spiritual and very complex
way also originates

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.330 align:middle line:84%
from this point in
location of time.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Aside from Jesus
as an example of the highest

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.740 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, are
there any more examples?

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I would say it's super
abstract from the derived

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.020 align:middle line:84%
biblical and religious
concepts that we have on Earth.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Everything I know about
it is from pretty advanced

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.780 align:middle line:84%
but complex spiritual concepts
that beings from Orion have.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So basically, if we're talking
about the Zeta Reticuli

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.820 align:middle line:84%
and Greys, for example,
they do have something

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.520 align:middle line:84%
that we would call
spirituality in some way,

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:84%
even it's way more advanced
and very exotic to us.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.940 align:middle line:84%
But their story, which
is super alien, actually,

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.990 align:middle line:84%
to what we perceive, what we
would call Christ consciousness

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.130 align:middle line:84%
is actually coming from
this being around Saturn

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.670 align:middle line:84%
and it's currently being
hauled back and isolated

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.730 align:middle line:84%
around this planet,
waiting for a moment

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.180 align:middle line:84%
where it can spread
over the whole galaxy.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have
anything actually

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.500 align:middle line:84%
to do with the religious
or biblical assumption

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.720 align:middle line:84%
that we have around the historic
or mystical figure of Jesus.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are they located
on and around Saturn?

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: What we know is that the
Council of 7 around Saturn is

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.760 align:middle line:84%
actually the first life form
in the solar system and beyond

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.900 align:middle line:84%
that actually reached
this very, very high level

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.040 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.420 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that there
aren't other forms of life that

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.210 align:middle line:84%
will also reach Level
7 consciousness, which

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.830 align:middle line:84%
will totally create different
pathways for the universe.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:06.310 align:middle line:84%
But as we know, it's the highest
successful point and location

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.683 align:middle line:84%
inside and outside of time that
exists at this very moment.

00:07:10.683 --> 00:07:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: As the
pyramid descends,

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.260 align:middle line:84%
how do we get to
the Council of 7?

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.010 align:middle line:90%
And who are the members?

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So if we're
talking about this galaxy,

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
the official representative
in 3D actually is the Council

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.130 align:middle line:90%
of Andromeda.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.340 align:middle line:10%
This is the 3D
representation of what's

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.410 align:middle line:10%
going on in Level
7 consciousness,

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.670 align:middle line:10%
and they are actually in
contact with different groups

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.520 align:middle line:10%
among the stars and on Earth.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And basically on Earth,
this is way down the line

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.070 align:middle line:84%
but then you find all these
different space agencies,

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:51.400 align:middle line:84%
different military organizations
that all carry the triangle

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.710 align:middle line:90%
shape in the logo.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So far we have
the Greys, the Zetas,

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:56.950 align:middle line:90%
and the Andromedans.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.690 align:middle line:90%
Who else makes up the 7?

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: They're not
composed of seven groups,

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.060 align:middle line:84%
they're actually composed of
millions of groups in that kind

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:90%
of way.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.980 align:middle line:84%
It's still a pyramid
shape bringing down

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.070 align:middle line:84%
the order and advices coming
from the Council of 7.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:17.510 align:middle line:84%
But being 6, for example, is one
of the members of them as well.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:20.680 align:middle line:90%
So they also report to Saturn.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, we're
reaching realms of existence

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.210 align:middle line:84%
that are so exotic and far
away that definitions of life

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.570 align:middle line:90%
are really hard to make.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So if we are talking about
3D representation of it,

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:39.039 align:middle line:84%
then the Council of Andromeda
is the official representative

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.049 align:middle line:90%
of the Council of 7.

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And the number 7 actually
comes from the highest state

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:84%
of frequential
harmony and actually

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.872 align:middle line:90%
the logo also refers to that.

00:08:50.872 --> 00:08:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What is the
significance of Saturn you keep

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.070 align:middle line:90%
referring to, Tim?

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Basically, planets in
itself are life forms as well.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.630 align:middle line:84%
So if we take the sun
in its original form

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and not in the way that from
our perspective receive it,

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.750 align:middle line:84%
then we would see
that the sun is

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.210 align:middle line:84%
actually in this solar
system the first giver

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.080 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is actually where you
see the ancient Egyptians, why

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.850 align:middle line:84%
you see the Sumerians, why
you see all those Mayans

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.240 align:middle line:84%
and different other ancient
civilizations actually paying

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.080 align:middle line:84%
respect and worshiping this
solar entity in this way.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Because they all understand
that consciousness actually

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.120 align:middle line:90%
comes from the solar activity.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.660 align:middle line:84%
If we think outside of the
box of our own reality, then

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:39.070 align:middle line:84%
the planet itself is part of
this harmonious field that

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.260 align:middle line:90%
curves around the solar system.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And from their perspective,
they have an enhanced reality,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.930 align:middle line:84%
enhanced perception of
Saturn, and it's not

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:54.910 align:middle line:84%
only a planet anymore or
life sphere, it's much more.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:10:00.160 align:middle line:84%
It's its own reality and its own
entity, its own sentient being.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: When you speak about
Saturn as a sentient being,

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.120 align:middle line:90%
is it a different reality?

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: It is used as a base but
it's also a different reality.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.360 align:middle line:84%
So if you think of a very
enhanced moment of perception

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.520 align:middle line:84%
and reality, then you
will see that they

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.350 align:middle line:84%
create their own reality
field around that.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.850 align:middle line:84%
But on this level of
perception and the way

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:29.440 align:middle line:84%
that we as 3D, 4D,
5D beings receive it,

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.510 align:middle line:84%
it's also been used as a
tangible 3D manifestation

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:38.500 align:middle line:90%
basis and a location in time.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Who are the beings
who lived on or around Saturn?

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I don't know if there
are beings living on Saturn

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.200 align:middle line:84%
but what we know is that
the planet itself is a kind

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.920 align:middle line:84%
of a location in order to
make meetings possible.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:84%
The Council of 7 has
also been understood

00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:84%
as a very tangible and
physical reality where

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:06.760 align:middle line:84%
gatekeepers, I think it's
what the translation would be,

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.460 align:middle line:84%
more or less
holographically portrayed

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and people enter
that field and have

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.170 align:middle line:90%
direct communication with them.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And also, the ring
around Saturn is

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:21.530 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be some kind of
defensive barrier with a lot

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.370 align:middle line:90%
of infrastructure in it.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So there isn't a
dominant species living around

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.570 align:middle line:84%
or on Saturn in the same way as
humans are the dominant species

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:30.500 align:middle line:90%
on Earth?

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, we know that some
kind of life form is living

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:33.880 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if it's a 3D form.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if there
are houses in that way,

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:40.950 align:middle line:90%
if you understand me.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.560 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
that is the case.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:48.350 align:middle line:84%
What we know is that just as
much as we have space stations

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:52.640 align:middle line:84%
around the planet Earth,
there's a lot of infrastructure

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:90%
around planet Saturn.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: This
infrastructure around Saturn,

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.653 align:middle line:84%
who placed it there
and who maintains it?

00:11:59.653 --> 00:12:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Good question.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically not been
placed there by humans.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.930 align:middle line:84%
I have no information
about who placed it there

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.710 align:middle line:84%
but it's maintained by
the Galactic Federation.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Basically, all those
members are actually

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:15.590 align:middle line:84%
part of the Council of
7 and they are actually

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.510 align:middle line:90%
doing the maintenance work.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What is the
role of the Council of 7

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So the role of the
Council of 7 is to draw

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:30.680 align:middle line:84%
in as many species, races, and
beings so they can have this

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:36.560 align:middle line:84%
unified field that combines
all possible realities.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.150 align:middle line:84%
That might be very
abstract to understand,

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.410 align:middle line:84%
but if you want to see
it from our perspective,

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%
then again we have this problem
in the universe in duality,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.700 align:middle line:84%
actually, because this
is a dualistic universe

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:54.690 align:middle line:84%
or version of the universe that
things are opposing each other.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So you always have some kind
of conflict or differences

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.070 align:middle line:90%
in opinions.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:04.070 align:middle line:84%
So planet Saturn
or the Council of 7

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:09.890 align:middle line:84%
actually gives allowance to
certain missions to take place.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Whenever, for example, a
being contacts another being.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:17.870 align:middle line:84%
If you, for example,
take an ET species

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:25.300 align:middle line:84%
that appears on planet Earth
or goes into contact work

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.480 align:middle line:90%
in that field.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.470 align:middle line:84%
So they always have
to get their allowance

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.900 align:middle line:90%
from the Council of 7.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: For how long have
they been interacting with

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:35.170 align:middle line:90%
humankind?

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, so they exceeded
the need for time in that way.

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:45.400 align:middle line:84%
So at Level 6 consciousness,
which is the level of the--

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.170 align:middle line:84%
realm of non-existence, we don't
have to deal with time anymore.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So at Level 7 consciousness,
they understand themselves

00:13:54.670 --> 00:14:00.130 align:middle line:84%
as just a form of history
or a book to be filled up

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.010 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So they think of
themselves as ageless

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.590 align:middle line:84%
and they are actually, as much
as the universe is ageless.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:12.500 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of billions and
billions and billions of years.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.440 align:middle line:84%
If you want to think of
linear timeline in that way.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: As we grasp this
concept of what you're sharing,

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.890 align:middle line:84%
would it be fair to say that
a Level 7 must express through

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.640 align:middle line:84%
many different aspects for it
to integrate the 3D on Earth?

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Absolutely, so at least
in the form of Council of 7,

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.690 align:middle line:90%
that is very true.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And the best concept, still
it's not the perfect concept,

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.560 align:middle line:90%
is to think of God in that way.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's more or less a
God-like consciousness

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:46.320 align:middle line:84%
but it's still not
the unified source.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.340 align:middle line:84%
So source is still even
above the Council of 7.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to-- if you
really want to use a term

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.210 align:middle line:84%
and separate it from the
cultural perception of it

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and all those connotations
that come along with it, then

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.055 align:middle line:84%
you could say it's
God consciousness.

00:15:03.055 --> 00:15:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: On Earth, would that
consciousness be reflected

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:08.790 align:middle line:84%
through the great avatars
depicted in various religions?

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So while they
are using gatekeepers,

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:18.070 align:middle line:84%
which are holographic very tall
beings that actually make up

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:24.520 align:middle line:84%
this or form this Council of
7 in order to get information

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:30.340 align:middle line:84%
from this very, very high field,
I would say that the mystical

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.660 align:middle line:84%
aspects of those stories that
we have on Earth are, yeah,

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.490 align:middle line:84%
they're filled up with confusion
and a lot of misinformation

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:39.290 align:middle line:90%
in that field.

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's not quite
clear the same.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:84%
But yes, whenever you
think of certain deities

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:52.220 align:middle line:84%
or certain events taking
place, then ultimately this

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.650 align:middle line:84%
is all coming from
the Council of 7

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:59.630 align:middle line:84%
because they are actually
the first and the only being

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:04.640 align:middle line:84%
that we know of that is actually
deciding upon the reality.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And because they have a strict
plan on how everything needs

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:13.850 align:middle line:84%
to take place, they are
actually allowing or denying

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.630 align:middle line:90%
certain events and incidents.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What other examples
do we see from the Council of 7

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.090 align:middle line:90%
on Earth?

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So to be very exact
and to think from their point

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.100 align:middle line:90%
of view, then everything.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.190 align:middle line:84%
You mean everything
else is actually coming

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:37.320 align:middle line:90%
from their consciousness.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.320 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
think about it,

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:45.720 align:middle line:84%
then in terms of consciousness,
cosmic consciousness, then

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.300 align:middle line:84%
the first
representation of source

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:53.200 align:middle line:84%
itself is the sun as the
primal giver of consciousness,

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.720 align:middle line:90%
which is why it's worshiped.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And then the first
manifestation of consciousness,

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.430 align:middle line:84%
the first form of it
is the Council of 7.

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.859 align:middle line:84%
And then everything
else forms around

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:08.220 align:middle line:84%
through this kind
of reality field.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is the Council of 7
manifesting mostly from Saturn

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.960 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to other planets?

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, so the underlying
structure is they use planet

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Saturn as a manifestation place
in order to get in contact

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.500 align:middle line:90%
and reach down information.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But their approach to reality
is that they are this cloud

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.760 align:middle line:90%
of reality that we perceive.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.630 align:middle line:84%
So everything is
actually the Council of 7

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:40.930 align:middle line:90%
from that point of view.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:44.040 align:middle line:84%
So you are the Council of
7, I am the Council of 7,

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
is the Council of 7.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:52.470 align:middle line:84%
But again, it only takes one
or another one consciousness

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:56.520 align:middle line:84%
to break out of that and to
form their own reality field

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.800 align:middle line:84%
and become a Level
7 consciousness,

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly we have two
live forms of forms of life,

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and then that would
create a whole new dynamic

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.647 align:middle line:84%
because then you have
another dualistic universe.

00:18:09.647 --> 00:18:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You mentioned
the importance of creating

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.290 align:middle line:90%
stability and duality.

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain the
significance of that?

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yes, 100%.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually
the number one function

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.240 align:middle line:84%
of the Council of 7,
which is to balance out

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:30.120 align:middle line:84%
the tangible and hands-on
experiences of opposing forces,

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.670 align:middle line:90%
paradoxes, and conflicts.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.820 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what
their approach was,

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.120 align:middle line:84%
and this is shown in the logo
because the logo does not only

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.120 align:middle line:84%
have this one arrow that
points towards heaven,

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.560 align:middle line:84%
but it's also half of that
arrow that's pointing down.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So what they want
to share is this

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.590 align:middle line:84%
is actually the representation
of yin and yang in that way,

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:56.790 align:middle line:84%
but with a focus that
goes more towards heaven

00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:00.130 align:middle line:90%
than towards the negative.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.100 align:middle line:84%
So what they want
to express with that

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.980 align:middle line:84%
is that they say they
accept the negative

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.180 align:middle line:84%
but they want more positive
to counterbalance that.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.550 align:middle line:84%
So you have
actually-- and this is

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:15.810 align:middle line:84%
why you have seven
corners in this logo.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:84%
So you have four corners
that are pointing

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.580 align:middle line:84%
towards the positive and
three corners that are

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.710 align:middle line:90%
pointing towards the negative.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So they are actually allowing
for disaster and conflict

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:31.350 align:middle line:84%
to take place but they always
want to learn from that

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and have the approach that
even the negative is actually

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.350 align:middle line:84%
leading towards the positive,
if that makes sense.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: The first examples
of that logo and our connection

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.970 align:middle line:84%
to space are the symbols
from space agencies around

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Why haven't we seen that symbol
in our world before the space

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:50.597 align:middle line:90%
agencies?

00:19:50.597 --> 00:19:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Oh, you have
seen that symbol.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you take a $1
bill, you will actually

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:90%
see the pyramid on it.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So you will see the pyramids
as a representation of that.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.820 align:middle line:84%
So basically, all
the stories that we

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:07.140 align:middle line:84%
have around deities
and beings contacting,

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.230 align:middle line:84%
for example,
ancient Egypt, these

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
are all incidents that are
thought by the Council of 7 way

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:90%
back in time.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.950 align:middle line:10%
And even if you think
about Jesus and the idea

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:22.650 align:middle line:10%
that comes from that, and if
you compare it, for example,

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:28.110 align:middle line:10%
to Nietzsche who had this
thought that the first story

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:32.010 align:middle line:10%
of Jesus is actually
incomplete because there

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:35.460 align:middle line:10%
is no resolution to the
positive in that way,

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:41.580 align:middle line:10%
this is part of the Council of
7's idea of the negative needs

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:45.330 align:middle line:10%
to transmute into the
positive at some point.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, are you
suggesting that every pyramidal

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.460 align:middle line:84%
structure on Earth throughout
history is a symbolic

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.680 align:middle line:84%
representation of the
Council of 7 and the Level 7

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.480 align:middle line:90%
consciousness?

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yes, that's true.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And especially if you think
about the material pyramids

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:05.380 align:middle line:84%
always having a non-material
equivalent outside of time,

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:10.500 align:middle line:84%
which is more or less the
opposing pyramids that is not

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:84%
being seen below it, then
you can also draw the line

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.710 align:middle line:84%
towards the logo
of the Council of 7

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:24.840 align:middle line:84%
saying that there must be more
positive in the world that

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.880 align:middle line:90%
counterbalance the negative.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Here on Earth, we
have the A-shape or arrow-shaped

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:84%
logo symbolizing their
relationship to the Council

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:32.670 align:middle line:90%
of 7.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And through them, the
Andromedans are first.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Is that the pecking
order of the pyramid?

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: That is
the pecking order.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:84%
So actually, the
first representation

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:46.180 align:middle line:84%
are the Andromedans or
the Council of Andromeda.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.130 align:middle line:84%
What I've been told
what's going on

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:52.870 align:middle line:84%
is that planet Saturn acts
as the number one meeting

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:57.040 align:middle line:84%
point for these kind of
advices and suggestions

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.440 align:middle line:90%
and strategic meetings.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And that they use
some very exotic, more

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.370 align:middle line:84%
or less holographic
representations of themselves

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:14.470 align:middle line:84%
in order to get this information
from the Council of 7

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:16.510 align:middle line:84%
down to the Council
of Andromeda.

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And Andromeda actually
is responsible

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:24.310 align:middle line:84%
for the solar system, especially
for the contact with Earth.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:28.970 align:middle line:84%
They have as much as I
know, a human-like species.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:36.430 align:middle line:84%
So Andromeda has a very
closely related human species

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:41.180 align:middle line:84%
that is also a warring
species as well.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And they stand in contact with,
for example, the US military,

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:50.350 align:middle line:84%
the advanced covert military,
and different other militaries

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, when we see
these symbols on Earth and space

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.920 align:middle line:84%
agencies and TV
shows or even films,

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.310 align:middle line:84%
is that acknowledgment that
there is a conscious connection

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and communication with the
Andromedans and Council of 7?

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yes, 100%.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about
the television

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.830 align:middle line:90%
shows which is kind of curious.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:13.720 align:middle line:84%
I've also seen that I think
Stargate and Star Trek,

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:84%
they all have this
kind of symbol.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm not quite sure why that is.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:84%
It might be that
the media itself

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:25.180 align:middle line:84%
are part of this initiative
in that way in order

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:30.550 align:middle line:84%
to tell maybe the public that
this is an official program

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring people closer
to the idea of space travel

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:37.990 align:middle line:90%
and portal technologies.

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:84%
But this is just an
assumption but all

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.440 align:middle line:84%
the other different
organizations and groups

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.780 align:middle line:84%
that have this
arrow in the logo,

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:51.090 align:middle line:84%
they all want to show to each
other that they are part of it.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And because they are
only using the arrow that

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:58.380 align:middle line:84%
is pointing upwards, they are
also kind of showing each other

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:02.910 align:middle line:84%
that they should be well
positively perceived

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:84%
in that way, that
they are the good.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:05.957 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:05.957 --> 00:24:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Even though
certain nations appear to be

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.610 align:middle line:84%
in conflict on Earth, are all
the agencies connected to space

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:12.910 align:middle line:90%
unified?

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:13.710 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yes.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:19.860 align:middle line:84%
They are all unified by this
very strong and functional

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:23.160 align:middle line:84%
reality field that comes
from the Council of 7.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And they allow for
the conflict on Earth

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:30.540 align:middle line:84%
to take place because they
know that this ultimately

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:35.040 align:middle line:84%
will lead to peace, which
is kind of a curious idea,

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:39.990 align:middle line:84%
but if you think about
it and zoom out of time

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and see it then, if you
reflect on the negative,

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:49.770 align:middle line:84%
then it ultimately will
always lead to the positive.

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, explain how the
dominance of a warrior race can

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:53.740 align:middle line:90%
lead to peace.

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Well.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.040 align:middle line:90%
It's the experience.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:00.150 align:middle line:10%
So it seems like the
universe at least

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:10%
in this version of the
universe, the universe

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:06.690 align:middle line:10%
has this tendency to--

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:14.920 align:middle line:10%
this tendency towards drama,
towards chaos, and such.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.410 align:middle line:90%
But there's no way--

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:20.070 align:middle line:84%
there seems to be no way
around it at, least not--

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:23.020 align:middle line:84%
well, we don't know
another way right now.

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.320 align:middle line:84%
So if anyone comes
up with another way,

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.030 align:middle line:90%
that's pretty beautiful.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.630 align:middle line:84%
But right now, the assumption
is that the universe needs

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.090 align:middle line:90%
to play that out in some way.

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.130 align:middle line:90%
And it seems like--

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:39.060 align:middle line:84%
so the Council of 7 was
the first life form that

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.030 align:middle line:90%
actually completed this game.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:44.280 align:middle line:84%
If you want to see the
universe as a game,

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:49.740 align:middle line:84%
then they are the first
who took away the, well,

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.170 align:middle line:90%
the medal in that way.

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what is the role
of humans, space agencies,

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:59.350 align:middle line:84%
warring races, and the
Council of 7 as guardians?

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So basically, the new
formed Space Force in the US,

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.360 align:middle line:84%
they are also
carrying that logo.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And they also attributed
to them their intention--

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.880 align:middle line:84%
they call themselves
the guardians.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is an approach
to tell everyone

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:20.560 align:middle line:84%
that their intent
is actually to guard

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.840 align:middle line:90%
and to protect planet Earth.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.080 align:middle line:84%
So they also see
themselves as a positive,

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:90%
as a light warrior in that way.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:30.370 align:middle line:90%
So we are always--

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:34.210 align:middle line:84%
we're talking a lot
about the concept of what

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:36.100 align:middle line:84%
we would call the
light warriors,

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:42.220 align:middle line:84%
so positive militant
force that actually

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.750 align:middle line:90%
plays by certain rules.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So we have a huge set of
legislative and warrior rules

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.700 align:middle line:84%
that are actually coming
from the Council of 7.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's not possible
even though it

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.970 align:middle line:84%
sounds like a huge
mess in that way,

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.210 align:middle line:84%
but it's not
possible for everyone

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:07.790 align:middle line:84%
who's contributing to the idea
and the reality of the Council

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.850 align:middle line:90%
of 7 to just have their way.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:14.690 align:middle line:84%
They could not go out in
space and blow up a planet

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:18.140 align:middle line:90%
or invade certain planets.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:22.370 align:middle line:10%
They can do that, but they have
to get admission and allowance

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.000 align:middle line:10%
from the Council of 7.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.330 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: Would you
say the Council of 7,

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:29.570 align:middle line:10%
with the arrow-shaped symbol,
working with the space agencies

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:32.240 align:middle line:10%
on Earth, are they acting
benevolently for a higher

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.400 align:middle line:10%
purpose?

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:38.500 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of hard
to acknowledge that.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:43.170 align:middle line:84%
But their own approach and their
own understanding of themselves

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:45.690 align:middle line:84%
is that they are
benevolent, yes.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So even though it doesn't
seem to be that way, actually,

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:55.080 align:middle line:84%
because there's so much
cruelty and gore and hate

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:59.310 align:middle line:84%
going on this planet, Earth
is actually still considered

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:04.270 align:middle line:84%
one of the positive benevolent
planets and organizations.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:06.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to
talk to someone

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:12.120 align:middle line:84%
from the new-founded Space
Force or all these other space

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:16.200 align:middle line:84%
forces around Britain,
Germany as well,

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.950 align:middle line:84%
if you speak about their
own self-perception,

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:25.380 align:middle line:84%
they would all say they are
the good, the benevolent.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And from the understanding
of the Council of 7,

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.977 align:middle line:90%
they would confirm that.

00:28:31.977 --> 00:28:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: The leader of
the nation decides to take

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.190 align:middle line:84%
aggressive action
towards another nation,

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:39.190 align:middle line:84%
would that government be
read into the higher order

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:41.740 align:middle line:84%
of the A-shaped organizations
connected to our space

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.550 align:middle line:90%
councils?

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: There are direct
exchanges between all those

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:51.170 align:middle line:84%
groups that carry the A-shape
in the logos with the Council

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:51.970 align:middle line:90%
of 7.

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:54.820 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't necessarily
mean that everyone

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:59.830 align:middle line:84%
who is in government or in
different other organizations

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:04.750 align:middle line:84%
that they take direct
advices and suggestions

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:07.600 align:middle line:90%
from the Council of 7.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:12.280 align:middle line:84%
So I've met some high
level politicians

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and I would say that
the front row of them

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:18.950 align:middle line:84%
have no idea about
what's going on.

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:22.060 align:middle line:84%
It's more or less the
second row of people

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:26.410 align:middle line:84%
that are included in
certain organizations that

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:31.270 align:middle line:84%
are more secretive in that
way, get the real information.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And still, any conflict that
is taking place on Earth

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:41.780 align:middle line:84%
is actually allowed, kind
of OK to the Council of 7.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So if a foreign
leader decides to--

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:50.180 align:middle line:84%
the country has
certain organizations

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:54.980 align:middle line:84%
that are referring or
answering to the Council of 7,

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:58.790 align:middle line:84%
then an individual
is still allowed

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:01.130 align:middle line:90%
to get in conflict with that.

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:84%
But this would always mean that
the groups and organizations

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.770 align:middle line:84%
that are actually related
to the Council of 7

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.950 align:middle line:84%
will then get some
kind of advice

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:15.690 align:middle line:90%
in order to balance that out.

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:18.750 align:middle line:84%
So we might see
that, for example,

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:27.470 align:middle line:84%
in the secrecy of the UFO
topic, where things are going on

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:30.950 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes,
but there's also,

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:33.560 align:middle line:84%
and this is probably
the reason why

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.220 align:middle line:84%
you find this
arrow-shape in Star Trek

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:41.180 align:middle line:84%
and Stargate and
different other movies,

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:45.830 align:middle line:84%
this is the balancing
process, you know,

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:49.910 align:middle line:84%
of balancing out the
secrecy behind the scenes.

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How does
the Council of 7, Tim,

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.860 align:middle line:84%
allow this malevolence to
dominate the planet the way

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.600 align:middle line:90%
that it has?

00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Because it's part of the
universal play in their eyes.

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So even the disastrous
and an enormous amount

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:12.200 align:middle line:84%
of physical force,
killing, gore, or whatever,

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:16.400 align:middle line:84%
it's still part of
the way the universe

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.830 align:middle line:84%
or this version of the
universe is behaving.

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So they see it as a natural
thing to accept in that way.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So from your
background in governance within

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:31.570 align:middle line:84%
secret access programs, where
do you see humankind heading

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:34.300 align:middle line:90%
in the next 5 to 10 years?

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So we have several
different options where we

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:38.950 align:middle line:90%
could have.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:44.970 align:middle line:84%
So one thing is that we have
to, while the military did

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:50.340 align:middle line:84%
a good job in order to clear
the situation on the surface,

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:55.470 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest concerns
actually is the social dynamics

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:56.790 align:middle line:90%
that we still have.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So I talked about
the tribal nature

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.330 align:middle line:84%
of humans, which is
different sample groups that

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:06.640 align:middle line:84%
are opposing each other and are
in conflict with each other.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.300 align:middle line:90%
So that has to be cleared.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.210 align:middle line:84%
I know that statistics
and analysis

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:16.800 align:middle line:84%
say that a planetary
government is actually

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.630 align:middle line:90%
effective for most planets.

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:23.020 align:middle line:10%
So if we compare that with
different other planets,

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:28.470 align:middle line:10%
it's been seen that a planetary
government is something that

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:32.370 align:middle line:10%
solves this administrative
issues that we have,

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:36.310 align:middle line:10%
and this is something of
concern for different groups,

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:41.020 align:middle line:10%
again, because we've seen this
development from the 1950s

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:45.460 align:middle line:10%
that certain advanced group just
broke away from the mainstream

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:49.780 align:middle line:10%
just because they felt
like, in your case, congress

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:54.550 align:middle line:10%
or presidents or world
leaders, elected leaders

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:58.270 align:middle line:10%
would not actually be
quick enough in order

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.590 align:middle line:10%
to decide for certain things.

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:03.760 align:middle line:84%
So this is the interest
of certain advanced groups

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:08.800 align:middle line:84%
that there's a much quicker
administrative level

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.130 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And I would also say
that the nature of it

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:18.670 align:middle line:84%
is that the planet itself
has for far too long

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:20.940 align:middle line:90%
dealt with an isolated--

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:23.320 align:middle line:90%
or played in isolated situation.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So we're actually dealing
with an open system situation

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:29.320 align:middle line:84%
right now and more and
more of this information

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:33.310 align:middle line:84%
has been known to, well,
conventional groups

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and even floating into the
mainstream more and more

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:40.570 align:middle line:84%
because that's where the
personnel is coming from,

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:45.700 align:middle line:84%
that's where companies,
upcoming companies need

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.120 align:middle line:90%
to put their focus on.

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to be the
future or that's going

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:52.090 align:middle line:90%
to be the upcoming situation.

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, thank you so
much for being on the show.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.000 align:middle line:90%
It's always great having you.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.817 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Thank you so
much again for having me.

00:33:58.817 --> 00:34:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:02.950 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
