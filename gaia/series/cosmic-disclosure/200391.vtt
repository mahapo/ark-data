00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Today on Cosmic Disclosure,
we are talking about disclosure

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.230 align:middle line:90%
with Randy Cramer.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.933 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you for
having me, Emery.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.160 align:middle line:10%
Good to be here.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So the topic of disclosure
is a very complex one,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.600 align:middle line:84%
because there's so many
different stories going on out

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.479 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And many people
have beat up a lot

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.420 align:middle line:84%
of the old stories of
conspiracy and disclosure,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.760 align:middle line:90%
making all sorts of predictions.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So do you have any
insights on disclosure

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.540 align:middle line:84%
that you can share
that might be new

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:84%
that we could share
with the audience.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle line:84%
So I would first give a
brief outline and explanation

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.230 align:middle line:84%
to people that if anyone just
goes to their internet browser

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and starts looking
up new stories

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:84%
in the media about UFOs, or
about sightings, or about

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.360 align:middle line:84%
asteroid mining, or things
like this of nature,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find stories
that people are talking about.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So you have these
Navy pilots who

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.090 align:middle line:84%
have been cleared by the Navy
to start talking about events.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.360 align:middle line:84%
The Navy has requested
that former pilots

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.860 align:middle line:84%
who have had
experiences, that they

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.380 align:middle line:84%
want them to file in the
new reporting system,

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.140 align:middle line:84%
because they want to
document all of these events

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.505 align:middle line:90%
for a records release, right?

00:01:31.505 --> 00:01:33.880 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to just document
them for their own sake.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.920 align:middle line:84%
They don't need to do
it for their own sake.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.410 align:middle line:84%
They're doing it to collate
a stack of information

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.740 align:middle line:84%
that then they can release and
spend some time talking about.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.290 align:middle line:84%
So there's definitely
lots happening,

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:90%
no question about that.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Are they manipulating
some of that video and some

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.190 align:middle line:84%
of the information coming
to us through the media.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.060 align:middle line:84%
That is, for instance,
a lot of people

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.665 align:middle line:84%
are saying that the military
videos of the craft shooting by

00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:01.600 align:middle line:90%
is blurred a little bit.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.460 align:middle line:84%
They're not showing
it just right.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.320 align:middle line:10%
So there's still like--

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.169 align:middle line:10%
for me, it makes it
look like, well, yeah,

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.169 align:middle line:10%
OK, we're going to disclose
and make you happy,

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.067 align:middle line:10%
but we're only going to
disclose what we want.

00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And even though
they're saying they're

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.192 align:middle line:84%
going to do this with the Navy,
and all the pilots are always

00:02:17.192 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:84%
free to come forward,
do you actually

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:84%
believe that they're
going to allow

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.630 align:middle line:84%
the pilots to come
completely forward

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:90%
and us get the real information?

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we're going
to get most of it.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.223 align:middle line:90%
I think it's always speculative.

00:02:33.223 --> 00:02:34.640 align:middle line:84%
When someone says,
oh, we're going

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.110 align:middle line:84%
to get 100% of the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.670 align:middle line:90%
I usually say, probably not.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>> But why cover
up that 20%, 30%?

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Mostly to cover people's
asses who have made mistakes

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.030 align:middle line:84%
and made bad decisions, who
don't want to end up with

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.590 align:middle line:84%
a noose around their neck
for having made a very, very,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:90%
very bad call.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:84%
So some of it's just
self-protection, and some of it

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.960 align:middle line:84%
is still the notion that people
are ready for some information,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.260 align:middle line:84%
but there's still some people
who aren't ready for all of it.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's decided based on social
psychological demographics

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.180 align:middle line:84%
that a slightly reduced amount
of truthful information,

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
it's slightly, not
completely, slightly,

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.397 align:middle line:84%
is more digestible to a larger
percentage of the population

00:03:21.397 --> 00:03:23.230 align:middle line:84%
than the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.188 align:middle line:90%
but the truth would be.

00:03:24.188 --> 00:03:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And who analyzes that to
allow us to hear the truth?

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>> A number of DOD and
military intelligence analyst

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.740 align:middle line:84%
specialists whose job are to
take the raw data, analyze it,

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.920 align:middle line:84%
process it into a
disseminatable information,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.430 align:middle line:90%
and then release it.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And so, to your point about
the videos being potentially

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.550 align:middle line:84%
blurred, there was actually
in the Nimitz event,

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.880 align:middle line:84%
one of the radar operators
who stated quite clearly said,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.490 align:middle line:84%
look, I've seen better
resolution images

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.240 align:middle line:84%
of those shots than
what they've released.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.970 align:middle line:10%
So He certainly
admitted that there

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.920 align:middle line:10%
are high-def, high-resolution
images that they have, but, no,

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.830 align:middle line:10%
they're not showing those right
now because they still want

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.900 align:middle line:10%
a little bit of gray
area to maneuver in.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.170 align:middle line:84%
They don't-- they're not ready
to shock people with this is

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.230 align:middle line:84%
absolutely happening
right now no matter what.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.100 align:middle line:84%
It's more of that, if
you're ready to listen,

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.110 align:middle line:84%
and you're ready to believe,
then you'll catch on to it.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.600 align:middle line:84%
But if you're still
in the denial phase,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.190 align:middle line:84%
then there's
plausible deniability.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.440 align:middle line:90%
You can say that's too blurry.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.380 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't prove anything
So for the people who are not

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.860 align:middle line:84%
ready to accept, then they
can just deny the information

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.007 align:middle line:90%
because it's blurry.

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Is the government leaving
out some of this particular

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.385 align:middle line:84%
information so they can come
back later and say, oh, well,

00:04:39.385 --> 00:04:41.410 align:middle line:90%
by the way, yes?

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.610 align:middle line:84%
They certainly are
planning ahead.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>> They seem to have
a history of that.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they're definitely
planning ahead and have

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.210 align:middle line:84%
a notion of controlling
the narrative over time

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.885 align:middle line:84%
by releasing certain
information in a timed way.

00:04:54.885 --> 00:04:56.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's why these special
access projects now are

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:84%
formulating kind of a storyline
behind what's happening,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.780 align:middle line:84%
and maybe that's a
good sign for us,

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.300 align:middle line:84%
because it's closer and
closer to more disclosure.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.420 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't be doing that
if they weren't prepping

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.490 align:middle line:84%
for a moment when
they're going to have

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.167 align:middle line:84%
some point and some time to
have a public statement in which

00:05:21.167 --> 00:05:23.250 align:middle line:84%
they're going to want to
have all of that prepped.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.000 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
have a public statement

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:84%
and have people go, oh
my God, I'm so shocked,

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.250 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see that coming.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.990 align:middle line:84%
They want to make
a public statement

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and have the majority of
people go, Oh, yeah, I

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:90%
knew that was going to happen.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Where is that going now?

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there's anything,
on that agenda that's

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.010 align:middle line:84%
negative that they're
trying to prepare us for?

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Disclosure will go one of two
ways, predominantly two ways.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Not saying there aren't any
third options on this table,

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:84%
but predominately we're
talking about two options.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Plan A is take me
to your leader.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Plan B is, invasion,
hoax invasion.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of discussion
about what the better plan is,

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.460 align:middle line:84%
what has more loose ends,
what's more controllable,

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.920 align:middle line:84%
what's more likely to
get out of control.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Those are the conversations
that are being had by--

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Who's in charge of that?

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>> The way my brigadier
general explained it to me,

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.317 align:middle line:84%
and the way I explained
it to other people is,

00:06:18.317 --> 00:06:20.480 align:middle line:90%
imagine there is a giant table.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And at that table,
everyone who's important

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.460 align:middle line:90%
gets to have a seat.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And that includes
executive personnel

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.650 align:middle line:84%
from a number of
state governments,

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.290 align:middle line:84%
certain legislative personnel,
military intelligence

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:39.050 align:middle line:84%
personnel, corporate and
banking personnel who are in--

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.890 align:middle line:84%
have the both the need
to know and the need

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.700 align:middle line:84%
to be able to dictate how
some of this is going to go.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're going
to have a disclosure plan,

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle line:84%
you need to have all of
those people cooperating.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.500 align:middle line:84%
The last thing you
want is a major player

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.590 align:middle line:84%
to go against what
everyone else is doing,

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and have a press
conference, and start

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.810 align:middle line:84%
offering an alternative
narrative that messes

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.910 align:middle line:90%
with the overall narrative.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So at this large table,
where all of these people

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.010 align:middle line:84%
are sitting, there
is a conversation,

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and there are briefing
packets that are handed around

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.520 align:middle line:90%
to these people.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:90%
And there's discussions.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.450 align:middle line:84%
If we do it this way, here
are the positives, here

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:19.250 align:middle line:90%
the negatives.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.470 align:middle line:84%
If we do it this way, here
are the positives, here

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.500 align:middle line:90%
the negatives.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, everyone gets to sit
around and complain and debate

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.870 align:middle line:84%
about their own
personal self-interest

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.880 align:middle line:84%
and whether it's
being answered to,

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.780 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's on the table
to be a benefit for them,

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.370 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's just going
to benefit everybody else.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.430 align:middle line:84%
So then, the devil
is in the details

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.190 align:middle line:84%
in getting all of
those people to agree.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And when everyone
agrees on something,

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.212 align:middle line:84%
then we will move
a plan forward,

00:07:45.212 --> 00:07:46.420 align:middle line:90%
whichever that's going to be.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, through my experience,
it's been very rare that they

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.300 align:middle line:90%
all do agree.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And usually the majority
will take over that scenario.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.160 align:middle line:10%
And I can see this also,
playing devil's advocate,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.280 align:middle line:10%
by sharing these
videos from the Navy

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.300 align:middle line:10%
and the Air Force to people
is also maybe preparing them

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.120 align:middle line:10%
for another agenda,
where they could

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.090 align:middle line:10%
create a negative environment
somewhere to make money off of.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, what do
you think about that?

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>> All of these
things are possible.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:24.140 align:middle line:84%
What it comes down to is, do
I, we, trust the administration

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.710 align:middle line:84%
of these projects
because the people who

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.740 align:middle line:84%
were in charge of
them are good people,

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.409 align:middle line:84%
or can we speculate
that it's likely to go

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.929 align:middle line:84%
19 different bad directions
because the people who

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:38.659 align:middle line:84%
are in charge have no
ethical and moral center.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:43.190 align:middle line:84%
That's a difficult place for me
to convince a civilian what is

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.710 align:middle line:84%
or what isn't,
because I can assert

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.330 align:middle line:84%
to someone this is
what's happening,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.520 align:middle line:90%
this is what we know.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.400 align:middle line:84%
But being able to prove that
is a whole other matter.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:84%
So with rank and
security clearance,

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.200 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I have
access to information

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.760 align:middle line:84%
that I don't need to ask
too many questions about.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to debate
whether it's accurate or not.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:06.550 align:middle line:84%
I feel pretty convinced,
based on the communication

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.860 align:middle line:84%
with the chain of command at
United States Marine Corps

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Special Section and
our intelligence

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:14.290 align:middle line:84%
officers that I'm being
given accurate information.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's easy for me to
say, I trust these people.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.980 align:middle line:84%
But I can absolutely
understand people saying, well,

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:21.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Should we trust these people?

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:28.030 align:middle line:84%
So while I respect that
and I understand that,

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:32.110 align:middle line:84%
I just have to assert that
some of these programs,

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:35.350 align:middle line:84%
some of these disclosure
ideas that we were talking

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:39.490 align:middle line:84%
about rolling out 10, 20
years ago were being managed

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.030 align:middle line:84%
by people who were far less
trustworthy than the people who

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:90%
are managing them now.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you
think about the SSP?

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.680 align:middle line:84%
What's there-- they've going
to have a lot of information,

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.820 align:middle line:84%
a lot of technology, a
lot of eyes in the sky.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to
work with disclosure

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.310 align:middle line:90%
to get anything out, you think?

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I would strongly suggest that
they are the tip of the spear

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.940 align:middle line:90%
on disclosure.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And if there is a
single force that

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.530 align:middle line:84%
is moving this
farther and harder,

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.620 align:middle line:84%
faster forward
than anybody else,

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.230 align:middle line:84%
it is covert military's
space program personnel.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>> And they will report to who?

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Um?

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>> The president?

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.590 align:middle line:84%
They don't report
to the president.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.850 align:middle line:84%
They report to a
committee who is made up

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:84%
of civilian personnel,
corporate personnel,

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:90%
military intelligence personnel.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, again, there's
a committee of folks

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.650 align:middle line:84%
that make a lot of
these policy decisions.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And since this has
been in the media,

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:42.420 align:middle line:84%
this SSP is now you're
seeing the tip of the spear,

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.760 align:middle line:84%
why is that, because they're
going to see it first,

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.570 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be able to
report on it first to this

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:49.710 align:middle line:90%
group?

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's probably 20
reasons why covert military

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.750 align:middle line:84%
space program personnel would
want to think that disclosure

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:58.950 align:middle line:90%
is a necessity.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.840 align:middle line:90%
Probably about 20 reasons.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.490 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest
that the number one

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.340 align:middle line:90%
reason is personnel shortfalls.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.970 align:middle line:84%
There are not enough bodies
to fill the jobs that we have

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.130 align:middle line:84%
right now, and the
job projections

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.750 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to need to fill
over the next 5 to 10 years.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.440 align:middle line:84%
So if we continue
things the way that we

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.700 align:middle line:84%
have, which is classified
covert recruitment,

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:25.410 align:middle line:84%
classified covert borrowing
or stealing of people

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.650 align:middle line:84%
to get them into the program,
if we continue to do that,

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:84%
we're never going to be able
to put bodies in boots at jobs

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:90%
that we need them at.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.630 align:middle line:84%
So in order to meet the
personnel shortfalls,

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.360 align:middle line:90%
there has to be open enlistment.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And the only way we can
have open enlistment,

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:42.820 align:middle line:90%
is if we have disclosure.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.420 align:middle line:84%
So, again, while there's
maybe 20 reasons, including

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.930 align:middle line:84%
socioeconomic environmental
potential disasters that

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:52.860 align:middle line:84%
have to be mitigated, I
would suggest the strongest

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.740 align:middle line:84%
self-motivating reason for
the covert military space

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.860 align:middle line:84%
program is projections
of how many bodies

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.350 align:middle line:84%
they're going to need in jobs,
and the only way that they

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:04.150 align:middle line:84%
can fill those jobs, which
is with open enlistment.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Are they going to let us
know about these secret space

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:07.810 align:middle line:90%
stations we're building?

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to let people
know about how we're sending

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.560 align:middle line:90%
people to other planets?

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, I would suggest
that it's unlikely we'll get

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.040 align:middle line:84%
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth period.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.840 align:middle line:84%
It's more likely that
we're going to get

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.790 align:middle line:90%
a percentage of the truth.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's, all fingers crossed, hope
that that's a larger percentage

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.110 align:middle line:90%
than a smaller percentage.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But I would also
suggest that recruitment

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a multifaceted,
multi-targeted area.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.750 align:middle line:84%
You're going to specifically
target poster campaigns,

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.150 align:middle line:84%
commercial campaigns,
TV ad campaigns,

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:47.640 align:middle line:84%
internet ad campaigns to
focus on certain people.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:84%
I just caught an ad on
television the other day

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.850 align:middle line:84%
that was for Army recruitment,
but it was specific.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.210 align:middle line:84%
It was basically pitching
towards medical professionals,

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.750 align:middle line:84%
like doctors and nurses, and
how if they feel like they're

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.270 align:middle line:84%
driven to have a mission then
they should join the military,

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and become an officer, and be
a medical doctor, nurse staff.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very specific
targeting as opposed

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.510 align:middle line:84%
to, hey, join the
infantry, carry a gun,

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:13.770 align:middle line:90%
beat up terrorists.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:90%
So those are targeted.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And I would suggest any future
recruitment programs will also

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.260 align:middle line:90%
be targeted based on need.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.880 align:middle line:84%
So major tech universities
will be plastered

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:84%
with posters for engineers, and
software techs, and computer

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.300 align:middle line:84%
specialists, and blue
collar communities

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.460 align:middle line:84%
will be filled with
posters to try and recruit

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:84%
infantry soldiers, and it will
be targeted towards groups

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.710 align:middle line:84%
and the need, based
on what we're after,

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.200 align:middle line:84%
which is, again, bodies
to fill boots to fill jobs

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.590 align:middle line:84%
so that we can continue to
progress along the planned

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.960 align:middle line:84%
that we want to progress,
which is to continue develop

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.930 align:middle line:84%
this program, to make it
bigger, and bigger, and bigger,

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:52.800 align:middle line:90%
and bigger.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And I understand people may not
understand the reason for that.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:00.420 align:middle line:84%
The main reason for that is,
we have this ever expanding

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:07.750 align:middle line:84%
idea of safety, security,
prosperity, and stability.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And we realize that the only
way we can guarantee that

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:84%
is with an expansion of
territorial boundaries

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:84%
in which we have
military effect.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.040 align:middle line:84%
The larger we can expand that
boundary the more stability,

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.930 align:middle line:84%
we can create in this
corner of the galaxy

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:84%
and in this corner
of the universe.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And our goal is to create
larger and larger and larger

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.380 align:middle line:90%
pockets of stability around us.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>> What about all the
secret tech that we're aware

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:35.790 align:middle line:84%
of the SSP has, and the
AI, too, that they have?

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Is there any way
that can be merged

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.490 align:middle line:84%
with our current civilization
while it's happening?

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.320 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:47.190 align:middle line:84%
The question really just
remains, how much, how fast,

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.040 align:middle line:90%
over how long?

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.553 align:middle line:84%
Those are the,
again, the devil's

00:14:49.553 --> 00:14:50.970 align:middle line:84%
in the details on
those questions.

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that's
above my pay grade

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.810 align:middle line:90%
to be able to answer that.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:56.250 align:middle line:90%
But, definitely.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.410 align:middle line:90%
We need those technologies.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.140 align:middle line:84%
The civilian world needs
those technologies.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.860 align:middle line:84%
The economy of the world
has imbalances in it

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.330 align:middle line:84%
that if we don't
fix when it comes

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:10.740 align:middle line:84%
to gas and oil, medical
technology, information

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:14.460 align:middle line:84%
technology, combat
technology, I mean,

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.340 align:middle line:84%
those are things that
if we don't change them

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:21.540 align:middle line:84%
the outcome will suck
for everybody, right?

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.100 align:middle line:84%
We can look it on
paper and go, oh,

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.160 align:middle line:84%
if we don't change
this 5, 10 years out,

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.210 align:middle line:90%
this is really going to be bad.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's a matter
that these things

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.540 align:middle line:84%
have to happen so that those
other disastrous things

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.290 align:middle line:84%
that we're looking at
down the road don't occur.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:39.720 align:middle line:84%
But the question of
how fast, how much,

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.720 align:middle line:84%
how soon, over what
time, good question.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.160 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest that
free energy technology

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.800 align:middle line:84%
is going to be one of the
first things that comes along.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Advanced aeronautical
technology is

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:54.960 align:middle line:84%
going to be one of the first
things that come along.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.478 align:middle line:84%
Our advanced body armor
exo-suits, plasma rifles,

00:15:57.478 --> 00:15:59.520 align:middle line:84%
rail guns, those are all
going to things that are

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.668 align:middle line:90%
going to be to come out first.

00:16:01.668 --> 00:16:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, we're going to need
better medical technology

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.980 align:middle line:90%
to treat the wounded.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And so, the old
school stuff that we

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.140 align:middle line:90%
have is not going to work.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.140 align:middle line:84%
We're going to need to
bring in the new stuff.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And those are things
that the public might not

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.830 align:middle line:90%
hear about first.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:17.670 align:middle line:84%
The military may be using it
to repair damaged body parts

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and not tell the civilian
world about that right away.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.610 align:middle line:84%
It may be after the
end of a conflict

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.580 align:middle line:84%
and they're like, oh, by
the way, the reason why

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.520 align:middle line:84%
know we had such a
low casualty rates

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.573 align:middle line:84%
is because every time someone
would lose a limb we could just

00:16:31.573 --> 00:16:33.990 align:middle line:84%
grow it right back and send
them back into the field three

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:35.460 align:middle line:90%
days later.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>> So NASA has come out.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.560 align:middle line:84%
They've been talking about
this microscopic life in bits

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.110 align:middle line:84%
and pieces that they're
finding on Jupiter's moons,

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Saturn moons, also
in the atmosphere

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:52.470 align:middle line:84%
of these planets from plumes and
volcanoes have been exploding.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.780 align:middle line:84%
But they're only
given little tidbits.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.660 align:middle line:84%
When are they going to actually
come out and say, hey, we

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.350 align:middle line:84%
have found life, because
you and I both know it's not

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.300 align:middle line:90%
just bacteria that's out there.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.109 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, and let's not forget
that they found microorganisms

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and bacteria growing on the
outside of the International

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.930 align:middle line:90%
Space Station.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:16.829 align:middle line:84%
So not only are we talking about
the discovery and discussion

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:20.220 align:middle line:84%
of life on moons
and other worlds,

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.895 align:middle line:84%
they've admitted that there's
biological life in space.

00:17:23.895 --> 00:17:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>> It's everywhere.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.012 align:middle line:90%
>> Just floating around.

00:17:26.012 --> 00:17:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like the ocean.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there's nowhere else
that those bacteria could have

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.523 align:middle line:84%
come from except
floating through space.

00:17:31.523 --> 00:17:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And they found
something to attach

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.130 align:middle line:84%
to that they could
use as a food source,

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.040 align:middle line:84%
and survive in the
solar winds, and

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.760 align:middle line:84%
in those extreme temperatures in
hundreds of degrees Fahrenheit,

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and hundreds of degrees
below zero, I mean,

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.790 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we know that
these lifeforms can survive

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:51.360 align:middle line:84%
in these extreme conditions mean
that there's a lot out there.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.850 align:middle line:84%
But to simply answer
your question,

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:58.650 align:middle line:84%
the protocols have been gradual,
gradual, gradual, gradual,

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.052 align:middle line:90%
gradual until it's not.

00:18:02.052 --> 00:18:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going
to see is we're

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:07.290 align:middle line:84%
going to continue to see this
gradual progression until we

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:90%
have a major event.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we have
a major event, that

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.050 align:middle line:84%
leaves an opportunity to
accelerate that information

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.650 align:middle line:84%
and go from gradual, gradual,
gradual to big chunk,

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.870 align:middle line:90%
big chunk, big chunk.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that an event that
we are going to cause,

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.530 align:middle line:84%
or is that a unplanned
event of a visitation?

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Generically, that could
be any event that brings us

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.390 align:middle line:90%
to disclosure.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:34.530 align:middle line:84%
But I would suggest that
those events are the ones

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:84%
that we're more
focused on controlling

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:90%
than could happen randomly.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.070 align:middle line:84%
We feel that it's more
tactically and strategically

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.770 align:middle line:84%
sound to control that
narrative than to allow

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.420 align:middle line:90%
it to control itself.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have any specific
intel that you can share with

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.580 align:middle line:84%
us about those programs
or about that agenda?

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I, again, normally
like to avoid timelines.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.490 align:middle line:84%
But my brigadier has
said, that it's OK for me

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:04.970 align:middle line:84%
to suggest to people that
we should see something

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:08.518 align:middle line:84%
significant that we've never
seen before on a level that

00:19:08.518 --> 00:19:10.310 align:middle line:84%
reaches more people
than we've ever seen it

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:11.962 align:middle line:84%
before in the next
6 to 24 months.

00:19:11.962 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Will it be brought through
the media and the government,

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.340 align:middle line:84%
or is it going to be a worldwide
event that you just cannot

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.140 align:middle line:90%
deny?

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>> It should be a worldwide
event that no one can deny.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So anyone with a cell phone
could be out there recording

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.220 align:middle line:84%
this and we're all going
to share it together.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, what's the
government's plan

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.435 align:middle line:84%
right from then, because
now they have to answer.

00:19:29.435 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Are they just
going to say, well,

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.470 align:middle line:84%
we've been collecting
microscopic organisms in space

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.930 align:middle line:84%
so this doesn't
surprise us that there's

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.940 align:middle line:90%
an extraterrestrial here?

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Like a lot of ways that
the media handles responses

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.080 align:middle line:84%
to things, there are
often stages of responses.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.170 align:middle line:84%
So you sometimes can get
a first stage response

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:51.590 align:middle line:84%
that when the second stage
response comes along,

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.900 align:middle line:84%
it slightly corrects
or contradicts

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.640 align:middle line:90%
the first stage information.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And then, the third stage will
slightly correct or discredit

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:03.800 align:middle line:84%
the second stage so that by the
time you get five stages out,

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.900 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter what
they said the first time.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:84%
They've walked people through
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to that point.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's really just about
getting to here no matter

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.440 align:middle line:90%
how you have to get there.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So I would suggest
that the first story

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.325 align:middle line:84%
may be like, oh my gosh,
we're so surprised.

00:20:20.325 --> 00:20:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And then, the second
they're, oh, we're

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:25.130 align:middle line:84%
now talking to an
Air Force Colonel

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.590 align:middle line:84%
who says this is what
we've been working on.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.753 align:middle line:84%
And then, oh, now we're
talking to a NASA official who

00:20:30.753 --> 00:20:32.420 align:middle line:84%
says this is what
we've been working on,

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.210 align:middle line:84%
and, oh, now, we've got another
guy from somewhere else who's

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.230 align:middle line:90%
telling us this story.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So it will be a
progressive narrative

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.300 align:middle line:84%
that will get closer
and closer to the truth

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.500 align:middle line:90%
as they move it along.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And the other
big question I have,

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:49.930 align:middle line:84%
is how is the religious
part of the planet,

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.910 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual part
of the planet,

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and the political part of the
planet going to handle the day

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:90%
after disclosure?

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's part of the
question that we are examining

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.230 align:middle line:90%
for sure.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Who's going to balance
all of this mayhem?

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest that
there is a plan for that.

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.030 align:middle line:84%
There are a-- that there
is Plan A, there's Plan B,

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.530 align:middle line:90%
and there's contingencies.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:18.870 align:middle line:84%
So depending on
exactly what happens

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:22.110 align:middle line:84%
will depend on which
page we flip to

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, this is Plan B.
This happened, this happened,

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.010 align:middle line:84%
that puts us at
this contingency.

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:28.300 align:middle line:90%
Now, we do this.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we're talking about
7.5 billion people almost here

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, that they're
going to get a lot of tents set

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.800 align:middle line:90%
up know outside of every city.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.200 align:middle line:84%
One for the religious
community saying,

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.990 align:middle line:84%
why did you lie to
me this entire life?

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.510 align:middle line:84%
The scientific community is
going to have to answer that.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.733 align:middle line:84%
And the history of
where we came from

00:21:47.733 --> 00:21:49.650 align:middle line:84%
is going to-- they're
going to have to answer.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
people I believe

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.340 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
be really confused

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.320 align:middle line:90%
and maybe not even accept it.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.640 align:middle line:90%
And what will happen then?

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>> For sure, yeah, for sure.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So, first of all, let's
address the notion

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.740 align:middle line:84%
that there's one narrative
and one explanation

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.020 align:middle line:84%
that everyone's going
to have to absorb.

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.190 align:middle line:90%
That won't be the case.

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Social psychological
demographics

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.430 align:middle line:84%
are broken apart in such a
way that each chain of data

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:17.490 align:middle line:84%
that feeds those social
psychological demographics

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:20.100 align:middle line:84%
will be a narrative that
that group can accept.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, again, over time, you
go from stage 1, to stage 2,

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:28.170 align:middle line:84%
to stage 3, to stage 4, to stage
5 that the initial stage is

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:30.120 align:middle line:84%
more of a, it's
OK, we're not going

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.300 align:middle line:84%
to contradict your beliefs, but
there's something happening.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And that gets people
to accept something

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.360 align:middle line:84%
without feeling like their
beliefs are being threatened.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.540 align:middle line:84%
If you presented to
them in such a way

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.290 align:middle line:84%
that you're not
threatening those beliefs,

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:45.880 align:middle line:84%
you're telling them,
OK, this is happening.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to believe
or define this a certain way,

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.200 align:middle line:90%
go ahead.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.540 align:middle line:90%
That's fine for now.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.350 align:middle line:90%
That's phase 1.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:56.160 align:middle line:84%
When we get 2, 3, or 4, those
narratives will start to shift.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:02.020 align:middle line:84%
What we see on paper,
anyway, is that over time

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.680 align:middle line:84%
more and more chunks of
these social psychological

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.750 align:middle line:84%
demographics will just come
to a place of acceptance.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:12.980 align:middle line:84%
It looks like somewhere
between 14 and 90 days,

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.680 align:middle line:84%
and you will have about
85% of the population that

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.728 align:middle line:90%
will come to acceptance.

00:23:16.728 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:90%
That this is just where we are.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.260 align:middle line:90%
This is what's happening.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.520 align:middle line:90%
They may complain about it.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.230 align:middle line:90%
They may whine about it.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:84%
They may have all kinds
of issues with it,

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.050 align:middle line:84%
but they'll still be in
basic acceptance of it.

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:31.740 align:middle line:90%
It's that 15% that is a concern.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:38.720 align:middle line:84%
But we feel that the more
you get of that 85% on board

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:43.460 align:middle line:84%
with a narrative, it will
force a lot of that 15%

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:84%
to simply adapt or stand
against the entire rest

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:84%
of the 85%, which is not
going to go well for anybody.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So how it actually
works out, I'm

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:58.750 align:middle line:84%
going to be just as surprised
as anybody else is because I can

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:01.990 align:middle line:84%
see on paper how it's
supposed to turn out,

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:03.860 align:middle line:90%
what the contingencies are.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.650 align:middle line:84%
But like I said, we
won't really know

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.350 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen
until it happens.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:12.280 align:middle line:84%
But I would suggest that
there is a plan for that.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a notion for
how people are going

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.550 align:middle line:90%
to get through that acceptance.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to tell
25 different narratives,

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.360 align:middle line:84%
if necessary, to get
everybody to swallow the truth

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.050 align:middle line:84%
pill in such a way that they
can not vomit it back up.

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:29.037 align:middle line:84%
And then, again, once we're
past that 90 day mark,

00:24:29.037 --> 00:24:31.120 align:middle line:84%
well, then people would
just be habituated, right?

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.150 align:middle line:84%
It won't matter what they
believed before that.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:36.358 align:middle line:84%
They'll be habituated to,
this is just the way it is.

00:24:36.358 --> 00:24:37.692 align:middle line:90%
>> This is what's happening now.

00:24:37.692 --> 00:24:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the world
we live in now.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:41.720 align:middle line:84%
This is-- every time I
go outside and look up

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.760 align:middle line:90%
there's more spaceships.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.427 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's just
going to be a thing.

00:24:44.427 --> 00:24:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
it normalizes.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And so, once we get
to normalization,

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:56.140 align:middle line:84%
most of that 15% will bitch, and
moan, and complain, and curse,

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.510 align:middle line:84%
and swear, but they won't
do much of anything.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the currency issue
going to look like then?

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>> It's going to be a little
chaotic while we readjust

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.470 align:middle line:84%
the economic sort of
state of the world.

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And I know some
people are not going

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.780 align:middle line:84%
to like this when I say
this, but we're moving

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.670 align:middle line:90%
towards a single currency.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.220 align:middle line:84%
We're moving towards a
single economic system.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And I will again
suggest to people

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.150 align:middle line:84%
that the most
successful civilizations

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.480 align:middle line:84%
in the galaxy that we
know of became successful

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.240 align:middle line:84%
the minute they decided
to unify their currency

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:33.430 align:middle line:84%
and unify their global system,
because a planet with 85

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:38.680 align:middle line:84%
little microsystems is way more
chaotic and way less productive

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.920 align:middle line:84%
than a planet with a
singular economic system.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.900 align:middle line:84%
That singular economic
system will actually

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.250 align:middle line:90%
be good for everybody.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>> More food, more water,
more housing, more everything.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>> More access to resources
and the elimination of poverty.

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And let me point out, the
elimination of poverty

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:55.468 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
important things

00:25:55.468 --> 00:25:58.660 align:middle line:84%
that we could do, because
by eliminating poverty

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:03.640 align:middle line:84%
within the first
year crime drops 75%.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And within three to five
years, overall crime

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:11.830 align:middle line:84%
will drop upwards of 90% or 95%
because the majority of people

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:14.290 align:middle line:84%
who commit petty
crimes are doing

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.660 align:middle line:84%
so because they have
economic needs that are not

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.040 align:middle line:90%
being fulfilled.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.160 align:middle line:84%
If people had their
economic needs fulfilled,

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.890 align:middle line:84%
they would not be needing to
turn to other petty criminals

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:25.900 align:middle line:84%
to engage in petty
criminal activity,

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and to engage in that
criminal structure.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.760 align:middle line:84%
You would simply have
more people would say,

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.390 align:middle line:84%
you know what, I
don't need to do that.

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to participate
in your scam, or your gang

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:39.100 align:middle line:84%
activity, or your mob
activity, because I'm actually

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.280 align:middle line:84%
OK taking care of my
wife and kids without it.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:48.040 align:middle line:84%
So the elimination of poverty,
the elimination of crime

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.490 align:middle line:90%
go hand in hand.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And when you are able
to do those two things,

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.750 align:middle line:84%
is when the consciousness of
an entire planet will shift.

00:26:55.750 --> 00:27:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Because the 90% of suffering
happens in poverty,

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and if we want to eliminate
the consciousness of suffering,

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.890 align:middle line:90%
we have to eliminate poverty.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And when we eliminate poverty,
we start to eliminate crime.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:11.320 align:middle line:84%
We eliminate the
consciousness of suffering.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And when those things are no
longer a part of the equation

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:18.920 align:middle line:84%
are when we truly get the
opportunity to emotionally,

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.120 align:middle line:90%
socially and spiritually evolve.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I agree with that
completely, Randy.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.747 align:middle line:84%
I see a huge change
coming when this comes,

00:27:26.747 --> 00:27:29.080 align:middle line:84%
and it is going to be a little
chaotic at the beginning.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.940 align:middle line:90%
But it's going to smooth out.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.930 align:middle line:84%
I do have some concerns
sometimes when--

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:37.420 align:middle line:84%
because of what has happened
in the past of meeting

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:40.600 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials
privately, certain people,

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.700 align:middle line:84%
sharing technologies
that we don't really

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.020 align:middle line:84%
get to benefit until
100 years later.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.022 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that
might happen again?

00:27:48.022 --> 00:27:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Will it repeat
itself, the history?

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.360 align:middle line:90%


00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, I would suggest based
on the people who seem to be

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:59.110 align:middle line:84%
at the reins of this horse,
that's not as likely as it was

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.050 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So it is my belief
that the people

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.470 align:middle line:84%
who are in charge of
this at the moment

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:09.640 align:middle line:84%
are way better at having
an ethical, moral center,

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.142 align:middle line:84%
and concerned about outcomes
for everyone than they

00:28:12.142 --> 00:28:14.100 align:middle line:84%
are their own bank accounts
than the people who

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.820 align:middle line:90%
are in charge 20 years ago.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think disclosure
will you know elevate

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:21.220 align:middle line:84%
consciousness-- the
consciousness of the collective

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.510 align:middle line:90%
here on the planet?

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Do you think will become
more accepting of each other

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:26.410 align:middle line:90%
as well?

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Will it bring us together?

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the important
thing to point out there is

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:36.760 align:middle line:84%
what we believe is going to
happen immediately after,

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:41.710 align:middle line:84%
let's call it the conflict
and/or disruptive phase, right?

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:44.825 align:middle line:84%
That when that is over, then the
exchange programs get to begin.

00:28:44.825 --> 00:28:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And I don't get to talk about
this very often, because we

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.283 align:middle line:84%
don't usually think it's
part of the conversation,

00:28:49.283 --> 00:28:50.950 align:middle line:84%
but the exchange
programs are what's

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:52.120 align:middle line:90%
going to change the world.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And the exchange
programs are a number

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:57.680 align:middle line:84%
of academic
extraterrestrials who

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.060 align:middle line:84%
will come here to share
their information,

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:04.160 align:middle line:84%
but more importantly, millions
of terrestrial citizens

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.720 align:middle line:84%
will be chosen to go
on four or five year

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.530 align:middle line:84%
trips to other worlds,
learn about that culture,

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.140 align:middle line:84%
learn about their society,
learn about their civilization,

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.600 align:middle line:84%
learn about their
technology, and then

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.800 align:middle line:84%
do the equivalent of writing
master theses on the subject,

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and books on the subject,
and then come back.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:27.230 align:middle line:84%
So once those exchange
programs start,

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:28.730 align:middle line:90%
a clock is going to tick.

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, when four
or five years goes by,

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.910 align:middle line:84%
millions of terrestrial
citizens will come back

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.900 align:middle line:84%
from this journey with
millions of stories, millions

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.900 align:middle line:84%
of research documents,
millions of books

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.670 align:middle line:90%
on all of these other worlds.

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.850 align:middle line:84%
At that point, there
is no way to calculate

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:49.970 align:middle line:84%
what the influence of all
of that information will be,

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:54.560 align:middle line:84%
but I would suggest it will
change consciousness and change

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.310 align:middle line:84%
the viewpoints of the largest
portions of civilization

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:01.550 align:middle line:84%
on this planet in a way that
we have never seen before,

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and that can not be anticipated
what the impacts of that

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.740 align:middle line:84%
will be, but I would think
that the impacts will

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.900 align:middle line:90%
be more positive than negative.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wonderful.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.460 align:middle line:90%
Well, Randy, thank you.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.670 align:middle line:90%
It's been so interesting.

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:14.878 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being on the show.

00:30:14.878 --> 00:30:15.678 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my pleasure.

00:30:15.678 --> 00:30:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for having me.

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure".

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.810 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
