>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.940 align:middle line:10%
we are with Richard Doty,
a retired special agent

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.740 align:middle line:10%
who served in the
Air Force Office

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.240 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.560 align:middle line:90%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are discussing
Operation Tandem Sled.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.100 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what is
Operation Tandem Sled?

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Tandem Sled is
a intelligent collection

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.180 align:middle line:84%
operation conducted by
US intelligence service

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.070 align:middle line:90%
inside the Soviet Union.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.270 align:middle line:84%
We knew the Soviet Union
captured downed UFOs,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:84%
and we wanted to know
what information they

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.340 align:middle line:84%
had gathered about
these UFOs, and that's

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.770 align:middle line:90%
what Tandem Sled was.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, how
did they obtain

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.620 align:middle line:90%
these crafts to begin with?

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, there
was two crashes

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.070 align:middle line:84%
that we knew of that occurred
inside the Soviet Union.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:84%
One crash occurred in the
central part of the Soviet

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Union, one in Ukraine.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:90%
And we knew this.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:84%
We obtained that information
from human sources

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.150 align:middle line:84%
or human intelligence sources
or our spies on the ground,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.860 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, and from some
communications intelligence.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:84%
We also learned them about
traveling Soviet scientists

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.600 align:middle line:90%
when they left the country.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.160 align:middle line:90%
They came to conventions.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.190 align:middle line:84%
They would hint that
they knew about UFOs

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:84%
and they knew about
some crash UFOs,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and they related what
they knew about where

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.760 align:middle line:84%
and when these UFOs crashed
inside the Soviet Union.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, where
were they kept?

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.927 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They were
kept at a place called

00:01:52.927 --> 00:01:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Kapustin Yar, which is the
Soviet equivalent to Area 51.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.380 align:middle line:84%
It was located in the
southeastern portion

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.820 align:middle line:90%
of the Soviet Union.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And we knew exactly where
they were being kept,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.280 align:middle line:90%
in building or Area number 107.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do they know
where they came from?

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The Soviets
had some ideas

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.940 align:middle line:84%
that they came
from the same place

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:84%
that the Ebens came from, Zeta
Reticuli, because the craft

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:84%
that they had were
similar to the craft

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.410 align:middle line:90%
that we captured in 1947.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And how did the United States
actually know and become

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.380 align:middle line:84%
aware that the Soviets
had these craft?

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: We used human
sources or spies.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.110 align:middle line:84%
We would recruit
Soviet scientists

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.910 align:middle line:84%
or Soviet intelligence officers
or Soviet military officers

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.170 align:middle line:84%
that worked around there
or around Kapustin Yar,

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and we tasked them with
finding the information.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what information
did the United States learn?

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, we learned
that these crafts were highly

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.640 align:middle line:84%
advanced, that the
Soviets didn't understand

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:90%
anything inside the crafts.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't get any of
the electrical systems

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:90%
to work inside the crafts.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And we gathered this from
either talking to scientists

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.960 align:middle line:84%
or actually
conducting operations.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Very, very secretive,
clandestine operations

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.280 align:middle line:84%
where we sent intelligence
operatives, our own people,

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.960 align:middle line:84%
or military personnel into
Kapustin Yar to examine these

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.760 align:middle line:90%
crafts.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, did
you personally see

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.500 align:middle line:84%
any pictures or photographs
besides the debriefing

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.550 align:middle line:90%
that you got?

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I was
involved in briefing

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.300 align:middle line:84%
and preparing the teams
of military personnel

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.490 align:middle line:84%
that were going into
the Soviet Union.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Our job was to brief them,
train them, tell them

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.910 align:middle line:90%
what to look for.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.720 align:middle line:84%
We knew, or our scientists
knew, because we

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.120 align:middle line:84%
had captured UFOs, what to
look for in the captured UFOs

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.190 align:middle line:90%
that they had at Kapustin Yar.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.440 align:middle line:84%
So we would brief
our team members

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.470 align:middle line:84%
on what to look for,
what to take pictures of,

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.130 align:middle line:84%
what to analyze, and then if
they could capture anything,

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.490 align:middle line:84%
any items or devices
on these crafts,

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.530 align:middle line:84%
to get their hands on
them and bring them back.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So would you say
that's the end mission

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.690 align:middle line:84%
game, was to just
acquire the intel,

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.500 align:middle line:84%
get some pieces of the craft,
or was there something else

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.950 align:middle line:84%
being arranged to
acquire these vehicles

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.930 align:middle line:90%
and bring them back to the US?

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: My part of it was to
brief them on sending them

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.970 align:middle line:90%
into a hostile environment.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And they had a number
of covers and a number

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.792 align:middle line:84%
of reasons, a number
of systems that we use.

00:04:39.792 --> 00:04:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to go
into that, because they

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:90%
may be still using them.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.310 align:middle line:84%
But we were able to get
teams of four to six people--

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.400 align:middle line:84%
and some of them
were scientists,

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.260 align:middle line:90%
but they were all military--

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.740 align:middle line:84%
from Germany, from West
Germany, into the Soviet Union,

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and get close enough to Kapustin
Yar where they would then

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.970 align:middle line:84%
have to operate on their
own to get close enough

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.840 align:middle line:84%
and to actually penetrate
Kapustin Yar to find out

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.345 align:middle line:84%
this information that
we were asking them to.

00:05:11.345 --> 00:05:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And they were
tasked with getting

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.910 align:middle line:84%
anything they can
get their hands on

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:16.900 align:middle line:90%
and bringing them back.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, getting their hands on an
item, a device, or something

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.760 align:middle line:84%
inside an alien craft and then
getting it out of the country

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:90%
is really a task.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
system that we used,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.475 align:middle line:90%
the US intelligence system used.

00:05:31.475 --> 00:05:35.470 align:middle line:84%
It was highly classified
and involved the Soviet rail

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.310 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was a way
that we could get something

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.860 align:middle line:84%
from one part of
the Soviet Union

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.230 align:middle line:84%
to another part using
the rail system.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's all I'm
going to say about that.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.450 align:middle line:84%
But we had a method
that if they could

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.640 align:middle line:84%
get their hands on
something to get it

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:84%
from Kapustin Yar to another
point, put it on a train,

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.160 align:middle line:84%
and we would get it when
it arrived and in Moscow.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What a
massive undertaking

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.060 align:middle line:90%
event that must have been.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.757 align:middle line:84%
That mission right there
seems so dangerous.

00:06:06.757 --> 00:06:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It was, and we
did lose some people.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And we lost some people
either being killed--

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.090 align:middle line:84%
one particular person, we
don't know what happened.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.400 align:middle line:90%
The second person was captured.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, he
was later released,

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.600 align:middle line:90%
because they couldn't really--

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:84%
other than he was
in a denied area,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.310 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't figure out
what he was doing there.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:84%
They never in their
wildest dreams

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.890 align:middle line:84%
thought that he was
trying to penetrate

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.540 align:middle line:90%
an area of Kapustin Yar.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:90%
But we had team members--

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
and I call them
heroes, because they

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.560 align:middle line:84%
went above and beyond
the call of duty--

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:90%
to get from one point--

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and we could get them
close to Kapustin Yar,

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.335 align:middle line:84%
but we couldn't
actually get them there.

00:06:50.335 --> 00:06:53.080 align:middle line:84%
They were within
about 20 kilometers.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was a denied zone
around Kapustin Yar.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.430 align:middle line:84%
It's about a 20-kilometer denied
zone, which is about 12 miles.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And we got them
close, and then they

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.180 align:middle line:84%
had to operate on their
own to get from that point

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.050 align:middle line:90%
into Kapustin Yar.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they
would actually have

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:84%
to on foot or by other
means sneak in there.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.160 align:middle line:84%
They weren't coming in there as
employees or scientists saying,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be working here.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Was it like that where-- did
you have the ability or did

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.780 align:middle line:84%
the United States
have the ability

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.250 align:middle line:84%
to get contracts
for these agents

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:84%
so they would
actually be working

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.140 align:middle line:84%
in these classified
Soviet areas?

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, there
were some teams that

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:44.290 align:middle line:84%
were undercover with a
construction company,

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.090 align:middle line:90%
and I'll leave it at that.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:84%
So they could get close, but
the construction company,

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.220 align:middle line:84%
which was a West German
construction company,

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.560 align:middle line:84%
they weren't allowed
inside the denied zone.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Their work was on something
outside the denied zone.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So someone still would
have to go from the denied zone

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.130 align:middle line:84%
out to the construction
or the secret railway

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.380 align:middle line:90%
to get something exported.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes, they would.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
difficult. As you said,

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:84%
it was very
difficult to do that,

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.720 align:middle line:84%
because the Soviet Union
during that time period

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.640 align:middle line:90%
was a closed zone.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you couldn't
operate-- a foreigner couldn't

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.340 align:middle line:90%
operate in the Soviet Union.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.960 align:middle line:84%
It was very difficult
for our spies,

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.825 align:middle line:90%
even our embassy personnel.

00:08:27.825 --> 00:08:29.200 align:middle line:84%
Every time they
left the embassy,

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.000 align:middle line:84%
they were being surveilled
by two or three KGB teams.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:84%
So it was very difficult
for them to operate.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:39.273 align:middle line:84%
But there were ways that they
figured out on their own.

00:08:39.273 --> 00:08:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I call them
heroes, because it wasn't

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.390 align:middle line:90%
anything that we could do.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.560 align:middle line:90%
They did it on their own.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.685 align:middle line:90%
They operated on their own.

00:08:45.685 --> 00:08:50.320 align:middle line:84%
But almost all of them spoke
Russian or some other language

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.350 align:middle line:84%
where they would have
to use their cover

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.370 align:middle line:84%
in the West German construction
company or whatever

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.210 align:middle line:90%
the business.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:02.140 align:middle line:84%
We also used oil,
an oil company,

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.845 align:middle line:84%
which was allowed to
operate close to there.

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Not in Kapustin Yar,
but close to it.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And one particular team was
able to get in, take pictures,

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:17.095 align:middle line:84%
examine the craft,
and then get out.

00:09:17.095 --> 00:09:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And make it out and make it
back to Moscow, and then back

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.985 align:middle line:90%
to West Germany.

00:09:22.985 --> 00:09:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So the
mission was successful,

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.160 align:middle line:84%
and they never knew that
the Americans had anything

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.020 align:middle line:90%
to do with project Tandem?

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.535 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Tandem Sled, no.

00:09:30.535 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:84%
What happened was years
later, we cooperated--

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:84%
the Soviet scientists
cooperated--

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and this is back in the
2000s, 2010 or '11--

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.850 align:middle line:84%
where there was an
operation or a project

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.890 align:middle line:90%
that brought in Soviet--

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Russian scientists
then and US scientists

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:55.200 align:middle line:84%
secretly to try to understand
the extraterrestrial phenomenon

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and the technology that
was being offered at times

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.460 align:middle line:90%
by the extraterrestrials.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Years later in 2010
or so, the Russians

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.690 align:middle line:84%
and American scientists got
together, but not before then.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, did you personally
see videos and photography?

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And did you get to learn
about the propulsion

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.010 align:middle line:90%
systems on these craft?

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:90%
I saw pictures.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.260 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have an
analysis at the time I

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.940 align:middle line:90%
saw the pictures or the video.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.160 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have an analysis
of what they obtained,

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.860 align:middle line:84%
because these personnel
that went down there,

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.230 align:middle line:84%
they were primarily
intelligence personnel.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.510 align:middle line:84%
They were Special
Operations personnel.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And their job was to go
down and take the pictures

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and obtain whatever
they can and get out.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.150 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know really
what they were looking at,

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.630 align:middle line:84%
although they knew that these
crafts were not US crafts.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.580 align:middle line:90%
They weren't Soviet-made crafts.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.010 align:middle line:84%
They were
extraterrestrial crafts.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't have a chance
to analyze it or explain

00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.105 align:middle line:84%
what they saw or what they
observed or what they obtained.

00:11:00.105 --> 00:11:04.140 align:middle line:84%
When I got to Moscow, I was
placed in a diplomatic pouch

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.280 align:middle line:90%
and then sent to Germany.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And then we had access, and
we had to get it from Germany

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.638 align:middle line:90%
back to the United States.

00:11:11.638 --> 00:11:12.930 align:middle line:90%
But we did see the photographs.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.400 align:middle line:90%
I did see the photographs.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.130 align:middle line:84%
The crafts were
conventional ET crafts.

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:18.660 align:middle line:90%
There were saucer-shaped.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.590 align:middle line:90%
One was saucer-shaped.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:23.520 align:middle line:90%
One was more elliptical-shaped.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Both of them were
open to-- the Soviets

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.590 align:middle line:84%
had been able to open them,
so there was access inside.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.520 align:middle line:84%
But the team only was able
to access the interior, one

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.480 align:middle line:90%
of the crafts.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.600 align:middle line:84%
The other one, it was
just too dangerous.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Their time ran out,
so they couldn't

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.960 align:middle line:90%
get into that second craft.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.570 align:middle line:84%
But the first craft
was the bigger craft,

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.565 align:middle line:84%
and that craft was
quite elaborate inside.

00:11:48.565 --> 00:11:49.365 align:middle line:90%
It had seats.

00:11:49.365 --> 00:11:51.090 align:middle line:90%
It had a number of seats.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.060 align:middle line:84%
I think somewhere
between 10 and 12 seats.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.900 align:middle line:84%
It had display panels, a
number of display panels.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.280 align:middle line:84%
But all the display panels
had little finger areas

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.890 align:middle line:84%
where apparently the
operators of the pilots

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:84%
would place their fingers
in these certain areas.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.750 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have any
knobs or switches.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.070 align:middle line:90%
But there was beds.

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.740 align:middle line:90%
They found beds in this one.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.240 align:middle line:90%
They considered them beds.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.700 align:middle line:84%
They found components
that they didn't know

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:90%
what they were, such as tools.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.020 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to
remember, this team

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.320 align:middle line:84%
had limited time
inside on target.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.370 align:middle line:84%
So when they went in, they
couldn't analyze anything.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.760 align:middle line:84%
They had to take pictures,
examine things, and get out.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And then they wrote
a report of what

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:84%
they saw other
than-- and including

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:90%
the pictures, what they took.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you tell us, what
was the title of the team that

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:90%
went in?

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.328 align:middle line:84%
Were they the cleaning
crew, or what were they?

00:12:46.328 --> 00:12:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: There were a
covert operating team.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Mm-hmm.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what was their--

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.080 align:middle line:84%
what did they-- what did the
Russians think they were?

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.428 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we know who they were.

00:12:56.428 --> 00:12:57.720 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's what I'm saying.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Are they the cleaners that go
in and clean the craft at night?

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They were employees
of certain companies that

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:10.560 align:middle line:84%
were working, sanctioned
inside the Soviet Union.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because it had
to be highly guarded.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Well, yes, they were.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.900 align:middle line:84%
But then we had teams that
were not either one of those.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:24.600 align:middle line:84%
We had actual military teams
that infiltrated that area

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.860 align:middle line:90%
and were operating.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And those are the teams who
were operating on their own,

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.055 align:middle line:90%
and they had to be very careful.

00:13:32.055 --> 00:13:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that we
had to help these teams that

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.110 align:middle line:90%
went in there--

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.890 align:middle line:84%
well, we had deep
cover operatives

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.682 align:middle line:84%
that we had dropped in the
Soviet Union back in the--

00:13:43.682 --> 00:13:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Long time ago.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: --'40s, '50s, and '60s.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Most of those were captured.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Most of those were found
out by the Soviets.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.780 align:middle line:84%
But there were some
that-- actually, eight

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.840 align:middle line:84%
were able to penetrate
Soviet society

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.670 align:middle line:90%
and they were working for us.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.620 align:middle line:90%
And those are the people--

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and then one of the
reasons why we thought

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:08.580 align:middle line:84%
we could be successful
is one of the people

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.870 align:middle line:84%
was quite prominent in
that area of Kapustin Yar.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Not right at Kapustin
Yar, but in the area.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:19.470 align:middle line:84%
So he could accommodate some
of our covert operating teams

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.060 align:middle line:90%
that came in there.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And he made the necessary
arrangements to set them up,

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.180 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.850 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't actually get
him inside Kapustin Yar,

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.760 align:middle line:84%
but he got them close enough,
and it was on their own--

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and they were on
their own from there.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Through
the intelligence

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.470 align:middle line:84%
photographs and videos,
did you learn anything

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.535 align:middle line:84%
about the propulsion
systems of this ET craft?

00:14:40.535 --> 00:14:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The
propulsion system was

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:45.420 align:middle line:84%
similar to the ion
propulsion system that's

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.470 align:middle line:84%
been talked about by other
extraterrestrial crafts.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.190 align:middle line:90%
They had pods, although they--

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:57.150 align:middle line:84%
it's all theory how
these pods operated.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists
could only theorize

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:04.405 align:middle line:84%
that positive and negative
ions were infused together

00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:06.150 align:middle line:84%
into another
chamber, which would

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:10.500 align:middle line:84%
cause high energy and a
propulsion of the craft.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were they successful
in getting these craft up

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.180 align:middle line:90%
and running?

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Not that we know of.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.340 align:middle line:90%
Not as of 1988.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what
occurred after that.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.730 align:middle line:84%
There are some even
internet chatter

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:31.380 align:middle line:84%
about the Russians
reverse-engineered a craft that

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.735 align:middle line:90%
was flying around Siberia.

00:15:33.735 --> 00:15:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do we know
anything about the beings

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:37.350 align:middle line:90%
that flew these craft?

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:42.930 align:middle line:84%
We did know that
one craft crashed,

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.750 align:middle line:84%
and the beings or
the entities piloting

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:90%
that craft were killed.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And we do know where they
were at Kapustin Yar,

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and we do know that the
bodies, the four bodies

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.570 align:middle line:84%
were transported
to an institute,

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:02.130 align:middle line:84%
a pathological institute
south of Moscow.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And we do know that the Soviets
performed autopsies on these.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And I believe-- we do know
that one of those autopsies

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.590 align:middle line:84%
leaked out some years ago
and was on the internet.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:21.450 align:middle line:84%
What they actually found
as far as the anatomy

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:84%
or the physiology of these
entities, I wasn't aware of.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.330 align:middle line:84%
But I know they had
them, and I know

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:28.870 align:middle line:90%
they did autopsies on them.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I think the autopsy on the
internet was very credible.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is connected to
the one that I saw years later.

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And I only saw a
small segment of it.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:46.980 align:middle line:84%
But I had a person, a physician
who saw the entire thing

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.530 align:middle line:84%
and analyzed it, sit
down and tell me,

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:54.660 align:middle line:84%
that was a very credible
autopsy by Soviet standards.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were there any other
initial intel follow-ups

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.260 align:middle line:90%
with any of this?

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: There was a lot.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:06.045 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were still collecting
communications intelligence.

00:17:06.045 --> 00:17:11.130 align:middle line:84%
We tapped phone lines
and telegraph lines

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.849 align:middle line:84%
coming from Kapustin
Yar to other places,

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:16.770 align:middle line:84%
and we were able
to collect data.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:20.849 align:middle line:84%
Because the scientists that
were studying the crafts

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:24.359 align:middle line:84%
inside Kapustin Yar
in Area 107, they

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:27.930 align:middle line:84%
were categorizing what
they were finding.

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And Moscow wanted
that information

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.900 align:middle line:84%
at their Institute of
Technology immediately.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So they were sending that stuff
as fast as they could get it,

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:39.820 align:middle line:90%
and we were collecting some--

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's more and
more intel for you guys.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Exactly.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't know exactly how much.

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.310 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't on that end of it.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.920 align:middle line:84%
But I know we were
collecting it,

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and exactly what
we were collecting,

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there was a
whirlwind of stuff.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So from day one until--

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:56.920 align:middle line:84%
how long did they
stop collecting?

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Or is it just--

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Oh, it's
probably still going on.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:03.000 align:middle line:84%
From probably the '60s
up until the '80s.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure-- you know, I
think probably after the Soviet

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Union fell in '91,
1991 time frame,

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:11.910 align:middle line:90%
it might have slowed down.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:17.100 align:middle line:84%
But the spying, the
Russian spying against us

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.110 align:middle line:84%
and we spying against the
Russians, that'll never stop.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:84%
What more can you tell us
about the Copper Green Program?

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Copper Green
was a classified program

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.110 align:middle line:84%
where we shared information
that we gathered

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.530 align:middle line:84%
on extraterrestrials
with not just Russia,

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.460 align:middle line:84%
but some other countries
that had gathered information

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.890 align:middle line:84%
about extraterrestrials
and UFOs.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And we worked closely
with scientists

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:84%
from other countries
such as Russia

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and try to understand
the technology.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, the
technology's so advanced

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.850 align:middle line:84%
that even today, we
don't fully understand

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:57.840 align:middle line:84%
the reverse engineering or the
extraterrestrial technology.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And years ago, 10 or
12 years ago, we still

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.120 align:middle line:84%
weren't understanding
it, and especially back

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.160 align:middle line:90%
in the '60s and '70s.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, this program didn't
start until the Soviet

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Union collapsed.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I think it started
sometime in the '90s.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And we're gathering as
much information as we can.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there's
a lot of information

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.845 align:middle line:84%
that we're not going
to share with them,

00:19:20.845 --> 00:19:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and they're not going
to share with us.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:23.303 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:19:23.303 --> 00:19:25.530 align:middle line:84%
It's always on a
trade, bargain usually

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.210 align:middle line:90%
when we do something like that.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.740 align:middle line:84%
What other countries,
Rick, can you

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.100 align:middle line:84%
tell me that were part of
that Copper Green Program?

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Copper Green
involved Germany, Japan.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.980 align:middle line:84%
I believe India
was involved in it.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Turkey, Saudi Arabia,
and South Africa.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Those are the ones-- and Canada.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:90%
The ones I know for sure.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure there were others.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.952 align:middle line:84%
I understand there's
probably 30 countries,

00:19:52.952 --> 00:19:54.410 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
every one of them.

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:57.350 align:middle line:84%
I just know those for sure
that were involved in it.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, is it still going
on to this day, Copper Green?

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.105 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Well I think it is.

00:20:02.105 --> 00:20:04.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm not an expert
in that area, and I

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.130 align:middle line:84%
can guess that it's
probably still going on.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Because I know at
one point when I

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.620 align:middle line:84%
was working for
another institute

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.560 align:middle line:84%
that there were
scientists at Area 51.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So I was wondering, what
are they doing there

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.710 align:middle line:90%
if it's not still going on?

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how developed is
the Russian Unidentified Aerial

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.895 align:middle line:90%
Phenomena Project?

00:20:26.895 --> 00:20:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They're
becoming more advanced,

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure, over the years.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Back in the
intelligence days that I

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:38.210 align:middle line:84%
was involved in the
program, the Soviets

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:43.490 align:middle line:84%
weren't that advanced as far
as the UFO technology went.

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.200 align:middle line:84%
They were still trying
to catch up to us.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And so their technology
was far inferior.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And so they tried--
they were trying more

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:57.650 align:middle line:84%
to catch up with us rather
than some extraterrestrial

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:00.067 align:middle line:84%
technology that was thousands
and thousands of years ahead

00:21:00.067 --> 00:21:00.867 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:21:00.867 --> 00:21:02.180 align:middle line:90%
And they realized it, you know?

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.450 align:middle line:90%
They had common sense.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
understand this.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.610 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
realize what this is.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:13.160 align:middle line:84%
But let's just steal the
Americans' technology, which

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.180 align:middle line:90%
they've done over the years.

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So we've noticed--

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.610 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing the same
craft and beings in Russia

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.680 align:middle line:90%
and also in the United States.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Now is there some
correlation, or is there

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:84%
something going on where
behind the scenes politically,

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.810 align:middle line:84%
the ETs are conversing with
the government of Russia,

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:35.660 align:middle line:84%
conversing with the government
of the United States separately

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.155 align:middle line:90%
or jointly?

00:21:37.155 --> 00:21:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: I'm not sure.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.393 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that somebody
above my pay grade

00:21:40.393 --> 00:21:41.810 align:middle line:84%
probably could
answer that better.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:47.780 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that there is
some common ground, so to speak,

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.420 align:middle line:84%
involving
extraterrestrial races.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.350 align:middle line:90%
They're not just visiting Earth.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:54.380 align:middle line:84%
They're visiting-- I
mean, the United States.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.760 align:middle line:90%
They're visiting all over.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do you
think about the language?

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems
that other languages

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:05.600 align:middle line:84%
have had an easier time
speaking and communicating

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.770 align:middle line:90%
with these beings.

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: We found that out a long
time ago, that language is--

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:16.130 align:middle line:84%
different languages sometimes
attracts different races

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:17.240 align:middle line:90%
of ETs.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:22.520 align:middle line:84%
There was a study done back in
the '50s by an Air Force group,

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.095 align:middle line:90%
advisory group.

00:22:24.095 --> 00:22:26.270 align:middle line:84%
They got that advisory
group together

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:29.840 align:middle line:84%
during Project Blue Book, was
an offset of Project Blue Book.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And they found
that certain people

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:37.220 align:middle line:84%
that spoke certain
languages seemed to attract.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of
people don't realize

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:42.620 align:middle line:84%
that Project Blue Book wasn't
just in the United States.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.500 align:middle line:84%
It operated at air force
bases all over the world.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.000 align:middle line:84%
So if there was a local
sighting in a particular country

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.730 align:middle line:84%
such as Germany or Turkey
or other countries, Greece,

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:84%
the Air Force would go
out and investigate that.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Very few people know that,
but that's how it operated.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And they found out, this
particular advisory group

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:08.540 align:middle line:84%
within Blue Book, found
out that certain languages

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.540 align:middle line:84%
such as Hungarian, people
who spoke Hungarian,

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.980 align:middle line:90%
Albanian, attracted people.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And we also found a long time
ago-- and I'm not sure where.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the knowledge
of where this was found.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.260 align:middle line:84%
But we found a piece of
metal with some script on it

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.340 align:middle line:90%
at a crash site.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
this occurred.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:31.050 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't at Roswell,
but it might have been

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.450 align:middle line:90%
at Aztec or someplace else.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.440 align:middle line:90%
But anyways, we had this.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And we found out that
this script was almost

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:44.280 align:middle line:90%
identical to Tibetan script.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And we sent people,
myself included

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:52.230 align:middle line:84%
and some other scientists,
we went to Nepal, Kathmandu,

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Nepal.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And we did some
research on this.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And we found in a
Buddhist monastery

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:02.610 align:middle line:84%
a script that had the same
characters as we found

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:04.230 align:middle line:90%
in this extraterrestrial craft.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:05.980 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that mean?

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that the
Tibetans are from outer space

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.780 align:middle line:90%
or the Nepalese are?

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:11.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:90%
I didn't analyze it.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an expert in that area.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:20.310 align:middle line:84%
But there's similarities
in languages, I believe,

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:24.610 align:middle line:84%
between the extraterrestrials
and Earthlings.

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were you able to
decipher that at all over time?

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It was a
form of a greeting.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.230 align:middle line:84%
This script, at least
in the Tibetan text,

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:39.940 align:middle line:84%
it was a greeting, similar
to a hello, how are you?

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not exactly
that translation.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:45.100 align:middle line:84%
It was a greeting,
form of a greeting.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And so they figured
that this piece

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:50.650 align:middle line:84%
of metal with the
script on it maybe

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:54.985 align:middle line:84%
was going to be presented to
us as a form of a greeting

00:24:54.985 --> 00:24:56.440 align:middle line:90%
or something similar to that.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:01.450 align:middle line:84%
But it was in a crash site of a
UFO, someplace-- and I'm sorry,

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:03.070 align:middle line:90%
but I just don't know where.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.950 align:middle line:84%
But I knew they had it, because
they had it at Los Alamos.

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And so they
connected that with--

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and the only language
they found close to this

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:18.170 align:middle line:84%
was in Tibet or in
Tibetan language.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And this was inscripted
in a piece of metal, you said.

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yes, it was on a piece
of metal found in a crash site.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think the scientists
figured there was more,

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:29.320 align:middle line:90%
because it was a piece.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.680 align:middle line:84%
There's probably more written
on this or more script on it,

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.590 align:middle line:84%
but they only
recovered one piece.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:36.770 align:middle line:90%
And it had this--

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:37.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was it thick like
a book or a very thin piece

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:40.530 align:middle line:90%
of metal?

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: No, it was very thick.

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:42.700 align:middle line:90%
Very thick.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.380 align:middle line:90%
Possibly-- maybe a book.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Hmm.

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Rick, thank you for
being on the show.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Always appreciate having you.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: My pleasure being here.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:55.390 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
