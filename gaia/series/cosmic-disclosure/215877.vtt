>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.410 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty, a
retired Special Agent who

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.970 align:middle line:10%
served in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.480 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately involved
with UFO-related intelligence.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're discussing
the Aberystwyth incident

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.000 align:middle line:90%
in Wales, United Kingdom.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.505 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.505 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD C. DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.250 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.458 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what can you
tell us about this incident?

00:00:40.458 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: In the early morning
hours of January 11 of 1983,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.550 align:middle line:84%
an object was tracked on
radar from Hofn Air Force

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Station in Iceland, all the way
down towards the United Kingdom.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.900 align:middle line:84%
This object flew across
St. George's Strait,

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:84%
flew over a farmer's
residence in Aberystwyth,

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:84%
which is on the western side of
the United Kingdom, in Wales.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.670 align:middle line:84%
We think it hit some
trees and crashed.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.920 align:middle line:84%
But after a crash, it was
able to somehow repair

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:90%
itself and fly--

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.470 align:middle line:90%
attempt to fly away.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.780 align:middle line:10%
The next morning, he
called the police,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.650 align:middle line:10%
who responded and realized
that this debris field wasn't

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.520 align:middle line:10%
a conventional aircraft.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:84%
So they immediately notified
the Royal Air Force,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.000 align:middle line:90%
and they responded.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.730 align:middle line:90%
They looked at the debris.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And they thought, well,
this isn't conventional.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:84%
We can't figure out where
these pieces came from.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.090 align:middle line:90%
So they took some of the pieces.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.050 align:middle line:84%
A Ministry of Defense,
or MOD, representative

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.340 align:middle line:84%
responded, a scientist,
looked at the debris and said,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.550 align:middle line:84%
we can't figure out
where this came from.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we're
going to have to do

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.680 align:middle line:90%
some more analysis of that.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.500 align:middle line:90%
After that, OSI became involved.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, the crash
is in Wales, United Kingdom

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and why is Air Force Office
of Special Investigations

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.810 align:middle line:90%
called in?

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, as I
said earlier, something

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.320 align:middle line:84%
was tracked on radar from
Iceland down to the UK.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:84%
The United States Air Force
knew something was flying.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.990 align:middle line:84%
But they couldn't
identify what it was.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Not only did it come off
radar around Aberystwyth,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.390 align:middle line:84%
it also flew over the
Saint George's Straits

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.660 align:middle line:90%
and disappeared.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And we had some US
Navy ships in the area

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.960 align:middle line:90%
tracking Soviet submarines.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And these two ships that were
tracking the Soviet submarine

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.340 align:middle line:84%
saw this object fly over
and go into the ocean.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's why OSI
became involved.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So is AFOSI called
on every one of these

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.880 align:middle line:84%
types of scenarios
where a craft is downed,

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.832 align:middle line:84%
not just in our country,
but it seems like they

00:03:03.832 --> 00:03:04.790 align:middle line:90%
are in other countries.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:05.590 align:middle line:90%
Are they worldwide?

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes, OSI is worldwide.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:84%
They have detachments
all over the world.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Back in those days,
they had detachments,

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.150 align:middle line:84%
even at embassies
in countries where

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.050 align:middle line:90%
there wasn't military bases.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And they had a special projects
branch dealt exclusively

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.520 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrial
crafts or contacts.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.020 align:middle line:84%
So OSI was the lead
agency in responding

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.890 align:middle line:90%
to these kind of events.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And during this
time period, there

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.140 align:middle line:84%
was an Air Force base
not far from there.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was called RAF Fairford
because all bases in the United

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Kingdom where the Air Force
personnel were stationed

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.240 align:middle line:84%
were still the Royal
Air Force bases.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And that's why they
call them RAF Fairford.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And the detachment, the 62nd,
40th OSI detachment at Fairford

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.600 align:middle line:84%
was the one that responded to
the Aberystwyth crash site.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.315 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How far was
that from that base?

00:04:05.315 --> 00:04:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It was probably 15
or 20 miles from Fairford.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And OSI agents went
there and interviewed

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.108 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Evans, who was the farmer
that discovered this crash site.

00:04:17.108 --> 00:04:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why did Mr. Evans
wait till the morning?

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I don't know that
he had ever explained that.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.220 align:middle line:84%
But OSI arrived after
RAF and MOD arrived.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Several days later,
we knew what this

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.350 align:middle line:84%
was because we had more
information about the object

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.130 align:middle line:84%
because of the radar contact
than the civilian police

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.550 align:middle line:90%
or the RAF.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:84%
So we went to visited
Mr. Evans and asked

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.690 align:middle line:84%
him questions
about what he heard

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:90%
and what happened on his farm.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's how OSI became
involved with Mr. Evans.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
interfaced with him.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he told us.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.172 align:middle line:84%
And we went on from
there to investigate.

00:04:59.172 --> 00:05:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did you find
out about the debris, what

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:90%
it's made out of?

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, when the RAF
got there days earlier,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.890 align:middle line:90%
they picked up some debris.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.540 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't
pick up all of it.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.950 align:middle line:84%
There was a rock-fenced
area west of the farmhouse.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And they never searched that
area when OSI got there,

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.130 align:middle line:90%
they searched the entire area.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.845 align:middle line:84%
And they found more debris
into this rock fence.

00:05:27.845 --> 00:05:31.062 align:middle line:84%
In UK, it's not uncommon
to see fences made of rock.

00:05:31.062 --> 00:05:31.862 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:05:31.862 --> 00:05:32.662 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:05:32.662 --> 00:05:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And they found some
larger debris in that area.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And OSI recovered that
debris, knowing-- remember,

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.850 align:middle line:84%
OSI already knew this was an
unidentified flying object

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.380 align:middle line:84%
because they tracked
it from Iceland

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.920 align:middle line:90%
all the way down to Wales.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.265 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't know
exactly what it was.

00:05:50.265 --> 00:05:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But you guys
figured it out, what it is.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.760 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: Well, based
on the examination

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.580 align:middle line:10%
of the debris that
the OSI found, now,

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:10%
it wasn't until much
later that the OSI

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.720 align:middle line:10%
got hold of the RAF debris.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.730 align:middle line:84%
But the OSI found debris was
taken to a base and analyzed.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And based on the OSI's knowledge
of extraterrestrial crafts,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.940 align:middle line:84%
we immediately identified this
as an extraterrestrial craft.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, that's why
OSI was so interested in this

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.340 align:middle line:84%
and why it crashed and what
other debris was left there

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.600 align:middle line:90%
on the scene.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.480 align:middle line:84%
So additional OSI agents
responded back to that farmhouse

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and did a detailed search
and found more debris,

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:84%
including a piece of
debris that was in a tree

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.030 align:middle line:84%
that nobody had found
until OSI came in

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.030 align:middle line:90%
with some special equipment.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:53.180 align:middle line:10%
And they found a larger piece of
an object, which they determined

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.910 align:middle line:10%
to be some sort of a sensor
because it was probably

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.500 align:middle line:10%
on the outside of this craft.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, jump ahead to when the
United States Navy ships, going

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:09.200 align:middle line:84%
through the channel there,
saw this craft come over

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.160 align:middle line:90%
and go into the water.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So after that, a
recovery operation.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.280 align:middle line:84%
The USS Gopher, which
was a salvage ship,

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.300 align:middle line:84%
was brought in along with some
other ships and a submarine.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And they found the craft
at a depth of 600 feet

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.938 align:middle line:90%
in the St. George channel.

00:07:25.938 --> 00:07:27.355 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they
find any bodies?

00:07:27.355 --> 00:07:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, during
the recovery operation,

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.540 align:middle line:84%
as they were bringing
the US Navy-- this was

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.500 align:middle line:90%
a secret recovery operation.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.370 align:middle line:84%
They didn't let the
British know or anyone else

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.090 align:middle line:90%
know what they were doing.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.840 align:middle line:84%
It was strictly a
US Navy operation

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.170 align:middle line:84%
with the USS Alamo, USS Gopher,
which is a salvage ship.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.810 align:middle line:90%
And they brought this craft up.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.920 align:middle line:84%
It was only about a
15-foot diameter craft.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:84%
As they got this craft up on
the deck of the USS Gopher,

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.220 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, without
an explanation,

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.690 align:middle line:90%
the hatch opened up.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.340 align:middle line:84%
But when the hatch
opened, no water

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.620 align:middle line:84%
came out, so they
figured it was airtight.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Oh, what are they
going to do now?

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to go in, send
sailors inside that craft?

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.180 align:middle line:84%
The commander of the
ship said, no, we're

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.600 align:middle line:90%
not going to send anybody in.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Because number one, we
have no idea what this is.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.530 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if there's any
dangers in there or any fumes.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:84%
They would have to
have special equipment.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.719 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have it on
that ship because it was--

00:08:31.719 --> 00:08:32.519 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A salvage.

00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:33.561 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: --a salvage ship.

00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So they had to wait several days
for other ships, US Navy ships,

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.480 align:middle line:90%
to get there with a team.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.970 align:middle line:84%
The Spang Air Base
in Germany was

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:46.750 align:middle line:84%
a DART team, an SDART, a Special
Downed Aircraft Recovery team.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.740 align:middle line:84%
They sent, I think, a
five-person team to the ship.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And they had a special equipment
to go inside that ship.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.470 align:middle line:84%
When they went inside
that ship, there

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.190 align:middle line:84%
was no extraterrestrials
in there.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.430 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like
as if this was

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.345 align:middle line:84%
a remote-operated
extraterrestrial craft.

00:09:02.345 --> 00:09:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: No sign of
life at all in there?

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: No sign
of life in there.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.250 align:middle line:84%
They had a lot of equipment
that we had never seen before.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And so immediately, this
became very, very interesting

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.406 align:middle line:90%
to US scientists.

00:09:15.406 --> 00:09:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So did
they ever find out

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:21.640 align:middle line:84%
if there were any ETs
associated with this?

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.535 align:middle line:90%
And if so, where are they from?

00:09:23.535 --> 00:09:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: No, they didn't find
any ETs inside the craft.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.290 align:middle line:84%
They actually sent, I believe,
submersible vehicles down.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.640 align:middle line:90%
600 feet is not really deep.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Submarines went down,
surveyed the area

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.210 align:middle line:84%
because they thought
maybe the bodies came out,

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.830 align:middle line:84%
maybe somehow as it went into
the water, the bodies were--

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Ejected.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --hauled from the craft
or something to that effect.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.450 align:middle line:90%
Well, they didn't find anything.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And they found that there was
no water inside that craft.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.413 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, if
the hatch had opened

00:09:52.413 --> 00:09:53.830 align:middle line:84%
when it went into
the water, there

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.970 align:middle line:84%
would have been water
inside this craft.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.730 align:middle line:84%
There was no seawater
inside this craft,

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:84%
no seating for any kind
of extraterrestrials,

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.348 align:middle line:84%
no navigation equipment, and
also no known propulsion system.

00:10:07.348 --> 00:10:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Was it seamless?

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:90%
Was it buttons?

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:90%
Was there TVs, screens?

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.347 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: There was no screens--

00:10:13.347 --> 00:10:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No nothing.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.883 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --no buttons,
no switches, no pedals.

00:10:16.883 --> 00:10:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What color
was it inside?

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It was gray--
dark gray inside.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:25.928 align:middle line:84%
And so then immediately after it
was analyzed by the DART team--

00:10:25.928 --> 00:10:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, where
was it taken to?

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Nevada
Test Site, Area 51.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.980 align:middle line:84%
They did a very
exclusive examination

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.970 align:middle line:84%
because they'd never seen
one like this before.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.512 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they find anything
interesting that's different.

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, they
found that it operated

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:84%
on a number of
different frequencies

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:84%
that were pretty close
to our frequencies, which

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:48.270 align:middle line:84%
meant that maybe it was not
an extraterrestrial craft.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was a craft from
Earth, from some country.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:84%
But as they started
taking this thing apart,

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.230 align:middle line:84%
they found some
strange-looking characters,

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.950 align:middle line:90%
which are not from Earth.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.810 align:middle line:10%
They're not Chinese characters
or Japanese, Korean, Mongolian,

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.650 align:middle line:10%
and also no language
or characters

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:13.380 align:middle line:10%
that we ever have found in
any other crafts that crashed.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.820 align:middle line:90%
So what does this mean?

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.340 align:middle line:84%
This means that this
craft was unique.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.970 align:middle line:10%
It was from an
extraterrestrial civilization

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.290 align:middle line:10%
that we've never
encountered before.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.285 align:middle line:90%
Which one?

00:11:23.285 --> 00:11:24.085 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:11:24.085 --> 00:11:25.585 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where were
those characters

00:11:25.585 --> 00:11:27.160 align:middle line:90%
located inside the craft?

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: As they were
taking the equipment apart,

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.320 align:middle line:84%
they found them
on the floorboard,

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.300 align:middle line:84%
almost as if it was
instructions on something.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.980 align:middle line:10%
There's quite a few characters--

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.740 align:middle line:10%
I mean, three or
four lines of it.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And so they
figured it was maybe

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:47.020 align:middle line:84%
some instructions or something
because they weren't visible.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.210 align:middle line:84%
They were buried under
some of the equipment.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.220 align:middle line:84%
So they figured it
was something else.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, they tried to trace
the language to Earth.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.730 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing comparable
to that on Earth,

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:58.380 align:middle line:84%
so the only thing
they can think of

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.990 align:middle line:84%
was a craft from
another civilization

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.670 align:middle line:84%
that we have never
encountered before.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.870 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't find any type of
propulsion system on this craft,

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:11.350 align:middle line:84%
although naval
personnel saw it flying.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:84%
It crashed because we
found pieces of it.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And we saw and
tracked it on radar.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.160 align:middle line:90%
So we knew it flew.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.060 align:middle line:84%
We knew it had some kind
of an avionics systems that

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.300 align:middle line:90%
allowed it to fly.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And it must have been
propelled by some technology.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.540 align:middle line:10%
But during that time period
in early '80s, we didn't have

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.940 align:middle line:10%
the technology
that we have today.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Jump ahead--

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.800 align:middle line:84%
I was about to say,
what's going on?

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Jump ahead
a couple decades,

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and we found this to be
something that we later

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.860 align:middle line:84%
had found in an occupied
craft from an extraterrestrial

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:46.660 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: That was
inside a craft?

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, that
had recently--

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and this was in
the early 2000s--

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.905 align:middle line:90%
had visited Earth.

00:12:53.905 --> 00:12:56.410 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Was there
any technology

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.267 align:middle line:10%
recovered from the
craft, inside the craft,

00:12:58.267 --> 00:12:59.350 align:middle line:10%
that you could talk about?

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: A plethora
of alien technology

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:90%
was found in this craft.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.950 align:middle line:10%
Because every piece
of equipment that

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:10%
was taken out of
that craft, once it

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:12.430 align:middle line:10%
got to the facility, Area 51,
was taken apart as much as

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.640 align:middle line:10%
could be taken apart and
examined and compared

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.520 align:middle line:10%
to other extraterrestrial
technology that we had.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:24.520 align:middle line:84%
So we had in our hands an
extraterrestrial technology

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.290 align:middle line:84%
from a civilization that
we've never encountered.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle line:90%
So that was a big deal to us.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:33.490 align:middle line:84%
We did find extraterrestrial
technology in that craft.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.560 align:middle line:90%
And now what do we do with it?

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.730 align:middle line:90%
How do we compare?

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.730 align:middle line:90%
Can we reverse-engineering?

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.320 align:middle line:10%
And some of the
things they found

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.350 align:middle line:10%
in this craft, that was
comparable to something

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:45.440 align:middle line:10%
that we had.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.690 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:51.620 align:middle line:84%
That maybe whoever created this
craft, whoever made this craft,

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:57.730 align:middle line:84%
had visited Earth and maybe even
lived here billions of years ago

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:02.020 align:middle line:84%
and used some technology that
maybe been handed down to us.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm just guessing on that part.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:03.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It was--

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:10.880 align:middle line:84%
I can't say similar, but some
things like our technology.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Because we could look
at a box over here

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:17.000 align:middle line:84%
that could very well have been
some sort of an altimeter.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's the type
of alien technology

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.260 align:middle line:84%
that was found in that
craft that really opened up

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.816 align:middle line:84%
our understanding of other
extraterrestrial civilizations'

00:14:27.816 --> 00:14:28.616 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:14:28.616 --> 00:14:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What other
examples did you find?

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, there were tanks
in there, which pressurized

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.890 align:middle line:90%
the inside of this craft.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, if there's no
extraterrestrial flying this

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:90%
that we know of--

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, why would they?

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --why would they
have these pressurization

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.150 align:middle line:90%
tanks inside there?

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe because the equipment
required it to be pressurized.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Because if it's flying
from one atmosphere to another,

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.230 align:middle line:84%
there's pressurization
that is going

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.580 align:middle line:90%
to occur within this craft.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Gravity, antigravity
has to occur.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe these tanks
equalized the pressure

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:84%
inside this craft, allowing
this equipment to work properly.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:18.510 align:middle line:84%
The other theory is because of
the pressurization tanks found,

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:84%
maybe extraterrestrials
were in this craft,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and somehow they
dematerialized or was

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:29.210 align:middle line:84%
able to disappear in
some manner because they

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:30.390 align:middle line:90%
knew it was going to crash.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And so they got out
of the craft some way

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:84%
that we just can't understand,
dematerialization or something

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.530 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.000 align:middle line:90%
So those are the questions.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And without the
extraterrestrials

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.220 align:middle line:84%
and without our knowledge
of that technology,

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:84%
we couldn't answer
those questions.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is it possible,
do you believe that when

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.590 align:middle line:84%
that hatch opened, that they
were using some sort of cloaking

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:54.996 align:middle line:90%
device to exit?

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:00.250 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't even thought
about until years later

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.610 align:middle line:90%
when scientists--

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.360 align:middle line:84%
because we had advanced our
technology to think about that.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.250 align:middle line:90%
We weren't at that level.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:08.875 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, we
weren't at that level.

00:16:08.875 --> 00:16:11.050 align:middle line:84%
These sailors are
on board this ship.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:14.470 align:middle line:84%
This craft is brought
to the ship from cranes.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
this hatch opens.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happened
in that millisecond,

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.560 align:middle line:84%
those extraterrestrials
could have left.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't know it,
and we didn't see it.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:29.360 align:middle line:90%
That's highly possible.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.700 align:middle line:84%
But unless we understood
alien technology

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.430 align:middle line:84%
or got a hold of an
extraterrestrial that

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.142 align:middle line:84%
was inside that craft,
we'll never know.

00:16:38.142 --> 00:16:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, did we learn
anything about their propulsion

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.530 align:middle line:90%
system on the craft?

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Or lack of--

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Or lack of, right?

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.346 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: --propulsion system.

00:16:46.346 --> 00:16:51.250 align:middle line:84%
We, at the time, in the '80s,
couldn't find a propulsion

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:52.662 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:16:52.662 --> 00:16:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Jump ahead, we think it was some
sort of a propulsion system that

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:00.680 align:middle line:84%
didn't use anything that
we're familiar with,

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.220 align:middle line:84%
any propellants,
a gas, or fuels.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.240 align:middle line:84%
They found some tanks and
some other things in there

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.069 align:middle line:84%
that they couldn't
ever determine

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:10.670 align:middle line:90%
what they were used for.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:14.560 align:middle line:84%
But because the fact
that people saw it fly

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.170 align:middle line:84%
and it obviously got
from point A to point B,

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:22.000 align:middle line:84%
that somehow there was a
propulsion system that we just

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.685 align:middle line:84%
can't figure out
how it was used.

00:17:23.685 --> 00:17:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, you did
mention years later

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.240 align:middle line:84%
that there was a similar
craft with beings in it

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.180 align:middle line:90%
that was recovered.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Can you elaborate on that
and make a connection or?

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:36.750 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: Yeah, we found
that 10 or 15 years later,

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:40.330 align:middle line:10%
there was a craft in the 1990s
that had crashed in the United

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:41.130 align:middle line:10%
States.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:46.010 align:middle line:84%
That technology was
exactly the same technology

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.320 align:middle line:84%
as the one we found
off the coast of UK.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:54.980 align:middle line:84%
But that craft that
crashed in the Utah area

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.380 align:middle line:90%
had extraterrestrials on board.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And these extraterrestrials,
four of them,

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.620 align:middle line:84%
were not described in
this particular report

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:07.430 align:middle line:84%
that I had access to
or by the OSI agents

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.710 align:middle line:84%
that investigated that craft
or was at the crash scene.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, that tells me
that there's something

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.700 align:middle line:84%
unique about those
extraterrestrials found

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:21.800 align:middle line:84%
in that craft that are so highly
classified that they're not even

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.140 align:middle line:90%
mentioning in the report.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, it
seems like there's

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:90%
a lot of crashing going on.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.200 align:middle line:90%
What's your belief?

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.990 align:middle line:90%
Are we taking these craft out?

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.420 align:middle line:90%
Or are they having malfunctions?

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.750 align:middle line:10%
What's going on?

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Some of them
we have shot down.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:84%
There are cases on the annals
of the UFO classified documents

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:45.440 align:middle line:84%
from DIA showing that an
aircraft was launched on alert

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.760 align:middle line:90%
and shot down.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Back in the early '90s,
there was one that shot down.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Japanese Air Defense Force
went up, shot this thing down,

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.830 align:middle line:84%
thinking it might have been
a Russian, but it was not.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.460 align:middle line:90%
And they recovered it.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.970 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
cases like that.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And there's cases where we
think because of something we

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:11.660 align:middle line:84%
have done with either radar
or microwave bursts, that

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:16.970 align:middle line:84%
disrupts their avionics systems,
that causes them to crash.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And then there's other theories
that our atmosphere is unique.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:26.640 align:middle line:84%
If you ask an
astrophysicist, isn't it

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.300 align:middle line:90%
just normal, our atmosphere?

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.780 align:middle line:84%
No, if you compare
our atmosphere

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:84%
to all the different
planets in our solar system,

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.630 align:middle line:84%
they don't have the same
atmosphere as we do.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:40.020 align:middle line:84%
We have a Van Allen's belt
that protects our planet

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.615 align:middle line:90%
from radiation.

00:19:41.615 --> 00:19:43.570 align:middle line:90%
Other planets don't have that.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:47.260 align:middle line:84%
You can go to mercury,
Venus, Mars, Saturn.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.760 align:middle line:90%
They don't have that.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.100 align:middle line:90%
So we have a unique atmosphere.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And when an
extraterrestrial craft

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:57.930 align:middle line:84%
comes from millions of
miles or light years

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:03.060 align:middle line:84%
into our solar system, sees our
planet that might be populated

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.430 align:middle line:84%
and decides, let's
enter it and find out

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.700 align:middle line:84%
what it is, they get
into our atmosphere.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And some things could
interfere with the operation

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:84%
of that craft,
including radiation

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:17.670 align:middle line:84%
or some other
atmospheric condition

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.520 align:middle line:84%
that we have unique
on this planet that

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.800 align:middle line:84%
could disrupt the operation of
those extraterrestrial craft,

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.480 align:middle line:90%
causing them to crash.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So to better understand
these exotic materials

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:32.570 align:middle line:84%
and beings, have they ever
called in the remote viewers,

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.955 align:middle line:90%
the psychics, the intuitives?

00:20:33.955 --> 00:20:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: There were
a number of cases

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:39.280 align:middle line:84%
where they brought in remote
viewers to try to remote view

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:43.210 align:middle line:84%
the interior of the craft,
location and where it came from,

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:46.040 align:middle line:84%
origination point, or
where it was going to.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And that is probably
so highly classified

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.170 align:middle line:84%
that I wouldn't
have access to it.

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And even the agents that
tell me these stories

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.340 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't have access to it.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
former remote viewers

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:84%
who came out and said, yes,
we did try to remote view

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.200 align:middle line:90%
this craft.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.800 align:middle line:84%
One particular craft they found,
they couldn't even open it.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.010 align:middle line:84%
They tried for a long time, I
guess years, trying to open it.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:11.830 align:middle line:84%
They bring in a
remote viewer to try

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:middle line:84%
to remote view what's
inside that thing

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.260 align:middle line:90%
because we can't get it open.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.970 align:middle line:90%
So that's happened.

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they part
of a military program,

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.290 align:middle line:84%
these remote viewers, like
Project Stargate and all that?

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yes, these remote
viewers were all in Stargate

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.560 align:middle line:90%
during that time period.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.768 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think that
Project Stargate is still

00:21:27.768 --> 00:21:29.560 align:middle line:84%
ongoing, even though
they changed the name?

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They terminated
Stargate in the 1990s.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And the DIA, the CIA
wanted something better

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:37.440 align:middle line:90%
than remote viewing.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Because remote viewing is
probably only 60% to 70%

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:42.900 align:middle line:90%
accurate.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not any more than that.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes a remote viewer
can get up to about 80%, 85%,

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and then sometimes he can't
even get 10% or 20% accurate.

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:57.360 align:middle line:84%
So they needed something more
than just remote viewing.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.520 align:middle line:84%
So I guess they went through
a number of different programs

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.560 align:middle line:84%
bringing in psychics and
other remote viewers.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And they developed
another technique

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.240 align:middle line:84%
called Thought Projection
Acquisition, TPA,

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.370 align:middle line:84%
which I think was developed
and finalized in 2010.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.960 align:middle line:84%
The first group of
these experiencers,

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.730 align:middle line:84%
they call them, the TPA
guys, went through that.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they have today.

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that's probably
80% to 90% accurate.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What's OSI's
responsibility at these crash

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.480 align:middle line:90%
sites?

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, OSI's
responsibility

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.750 align:middle line:84%
under the special
projects branch

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.900 align:middle line:84%
is to investigate
these crash sites,

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and then try to conduct a
counterintelligence operation

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.440 align:middle line:90%
through deception.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.720 align:middle line:84%
If there was a lot of
people in that area

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.020 align:middle line:84%
or the public
seeing this, now OSI

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.840 align:middle line:84%
has a generated program, a
counterintelligence program,

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.880 align:middle line:84%
to disinform these people and
try to explain or convince them

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.740 align:middle line:84%
that what they
saw, even though it

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.180 align:middle line:84%
might have been
extraterrestrial,

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.020 align:middle line:90%
was, in fact, one of ours.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And I've been involved in
that many different times.

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's what OSI's job is
there, even after the fact.

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:11.280 align:middle line:84%
There's been cases where a craft
was found by miners in Nevada.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And weeks went by before
the miners, because

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.070 align:middle line:84%
of the remote location,
were able to tell people

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:21.490 align:middle line:84%
about what they saw and
what they had out there.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:22.870 align:middle line:90%
OSI still went in there.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And their plan was
to disinform them.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And they can do it in a
number of different ways.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:34.060 align:middle line:84%
The deception operations are
explaining or threatening them.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the case
may be and whatever

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:84%
the particular operational plan
is, is what OSI will operate on.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And they'll do whatever
they can to disinform

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:49.160 align:middle line:84%
the people that whatever they
saw wasn't extraterrestrial.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.445 align:middle line:90%
It was, in fact, one of ours.

00:23:50.445 --> 00:23:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, well, I have to
ask you before we wrap it up

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:55.510 align:middle line:84%
here, is there
anything else you'd

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:58.397 align:middle line:84%
like to mention that I
didn't ask you about,

00:23:58.397 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:84%
that you can think
of, that you'd like

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:00.855 align:middle line:90%
to share with the audience?

00:24:00.855 --> 00:24:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, one of the things
is that I think, during the time

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:06.950 align:middle line:84%
frame that this incident
happened in 1983,

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:10.290 align:middle line:84%
UK wasn't notified
of the operation.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:11.680 align:middle line:90%
But we know that--

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Nick Pope and some
other people, know

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.470 align:middle line:84%
that years later, the UK
government, specifically

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:21.340 align:middle line:84%
the Ministry of Defense,
was notified of what we did

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and what we found
in the channel.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Whether we told the United
Kingdom anything technical,

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.980 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't know
that information.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.650 align:middle line:84%
But we did inform
them of our recovery.

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:35.025 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That was
after the fact?

00:24:35.025 --> 00:24:36.012 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: After the fact.

00:24:36.012 --> 00:24:37.095 align:middle line:90%
Many years after the fact.

00:24:37.095 --> 00:24:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, many years?

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:38.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.690 align:middle line:84%
So this craft and
the other craft

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.435 align:middle line:84%
that was similar
that you guys found,

00:24:43.435 --> 00:24:45.490 align:middle line:84%
the species that
were involved, you

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:48.110 align:middle line:90%
said back then we didn't know.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:49.040 align:middle line:90%
How about today?

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Do we know this species yet?

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: To the best
of my knowledge,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.410 align:middle line:90%
that hasn't been released.

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure the government knows.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:25:02.000 align:middle line:84%
It's locked up deeply
within the DIA or OSI.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.550 align:middle line:90%
And it hasn't been leaked out.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.760 align:middle line:84%
These questions have been
asked by not only myself,

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.370 align:middle line:84%
but many of the people,
including OSI agents,

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:13.690 align:middle line:84%
retired OSI agents that
investigated these cases.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.840 align:middle line:84%
But they were never told
because, as I said earlier,

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:20.490 align:middle line:84%
when they found this craft
that was similar, one that they

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:23.040 align:middle line:84%
recovered off the
coast of the UK,

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:28.860 align:middle line:84%
the reports didn't specify what
species was inside that craft

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.210 align:middle line:90%
that was found later in Utah.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:35.530 align:middle line:84%
So the confusion is, OK,
they're all the same crafts.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:39.210 align:middle line:84%
One had bodies in,
the other one didn't.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:41.110 align:middle line:90%
What species was that?

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's talking about that.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it's locked
away someplace,

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:90%
but I have no access to that.

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Wow, very
compartmentalized for sure.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:49.182 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Very compartmentalized.

00:25:49.182 --> 00:25:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Very intriguing.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.513 align:middle line:84%
Well, Rick, thanks so much
for being on the show.

00:25:52.513 --> 00:25:53.555 align:middle line:90%
It's a fascinating story.

00:25:53.555 --> 00:25:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Thank you, Emery.

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:55.450 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:59.970 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
