00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with Richard Doty,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.880 align:middle line:10%
a retired counterintelligence
agent who served in the Air

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.830 align:middle line:10%
Force Office of
Special Investigations.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.440 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us is
Tim, a tactical advisor

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.960 align:middle line:10%
to covert analysts trying
to understand the missions

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.960 align:middle line:10%
and strategies of nonhuman
intelligences on our planet.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.623 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:00:38.623 --> 00:00:40.748 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, on another show,
you said there will be no

00:00:40.748 --> 00:00:41.600 align:middle line:90%
disclosure.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.400 align:middle line:84%
You said it doesn't
serve anyone's interest

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.020 align:middle line:90%
to have an open disclosure.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:90%
What did you mean by that?

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's so much
complexity to a disclosure

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.780 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there's so
many different entities

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:84%
within the Department of
Defense and other agencies

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.790 align:middle line:90%
within US government.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:84%
They would have to compile
all their information together

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.458 align:middle line:84%
in one pot, so to speak,
and then release it,

00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:90%
and they're not going to do it.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Right now, the United States
Space Force, the newest branch

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.300 align:middle line:84%
of our military, is not
cooperating with the disclosure

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.160 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.070 align:middle line:84%
The United States Air
Force, although they

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:84%
say that they could,
there's a lot of information

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.907 align:middle line:84%
that they acknowledge that they
can't disclose to the public.

00:01:28.907 --> 00:01:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>> And whose call is that?

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Why is that with
the Space Force?

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Space Force, they
have so much on their program.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.470 align:middle line:84%
A special access program is
a highly classified project.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it could be 20 projects
into one and one program

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.760 align:middle line:84%
that deals with technology,
advanced technology,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.530 align:middle line:90%
reverse technology.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And also, it could show what
crafts that we've photographed

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.130 align:middle line:84%
coming into our atmosphere,
what crafts have landed,

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.490 align:middle line:84%
what we've done as far
as retrieval programs.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.000 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
different programs.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.940 align:middle line:84%
There's literally hundreds, and
some of them go back to 1947.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Although, we didn't have
an Air Force in 1947.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.020 align:middle line:90%
That was the Army Air Force.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.890 align:middle line:84%
But all those files were
switched over to the Air Force.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And when the Air Force
left the program,

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.310 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, in 1969 after
the Condon Report came out,

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.280 align:middle line:84%
they tried to look for
some other agency that

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:90%
wanted to take it.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.780 align:middle line:84%
DIA, a relatively
new agency that

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.740 align:middle line:84%
came into existence in 1961,
raised their hand and said,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.700 align:middle line:90%
we'll take it.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.240 align:middle line:90%
They wanted a mission.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.360 align:middle line:84%
So now the DIA is
involved in this.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.970 align:middle line:84%
They have thousands
and thousands

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.640 align:middle line:84%
of archival files
pertaining to UFOs.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.950 align:middle line:84%
How are the United
States government

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.070 align:middle line:84%
going to put this all
together for a disclosure?

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Right now, they're talking
about disclosures, but only

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.700 align:middle line:84%
recent information
about disclosure.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:84%
That's trying to
solve an algebra

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.960 align:middle line:90%
problem with eighth grade math.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not going to work.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you think, Tim?

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you agree or
disagree with that?

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Their only advantage
is to transparency.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I think a civilization that
wants to proceed and make

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:28.720 align:middle line:84%
progress is in a direct need of
transparency and cooperation,

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.990 align:middle line:84%
so I personally can only see
benefits from making everything

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.820 align:middle line:90%
as public as possible.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
the current trend

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:84%
shows that people
more and more agree

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.760 align:middle line:84%
to that, which means the
possibility of having

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.500 align:middle line:84%
an open system, the
possibility of having trade

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:84%
deals with other civilizations,
the possibilities

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:06.640 align:middle line:84%
for the whole planet, but also
for the power structure itself

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.650 align:middle line:90%
and those who lead it.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Another problem we have
is the government would have

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.410 align:middle line:84%
to come out and admit that they
disinformed people since 1947,

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.600 align:middle line:90%
probably even before that.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what we
actually knew before that.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.630 align:middle line:84%
I only know what we
knew up from Roswell on.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
to have to disclose

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.150 align:middle line:84%
to the public information
about religion

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.710 align:middle line:84%
that the ETs have given us
that could affect society.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.440 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of things
within this disclosure program

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:84%
that would not be so
beneficial to the public

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.770 align:middle line:90%
or nor to the government.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.810 align:middle line:84%
They certainly wouldn't release
a research and development

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.900 align:middle line:90%
on reverse engineering.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Why can't they admit
about the ETs and UFOs?

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
the whole question.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.430 align:middle line:84%
They could have been open to
the public the whole time.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Is it just because of
the reverse engineering

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.000 align:middle line:90%
and the technology?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, human beings
are very curious.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.840 align:middle line:84%
If you start talking
about one particular area,

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.910 align:middle line:84%
they're smart enough to ask a
million questions about that.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So if we just
released information

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.360 align:middle line:84%
that, yes, we did
have contact in 1947,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.490 align:middle line:90%
we've had contact since.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.770 align:middle line:84%
They provided us
some information.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.160 align:middle line:90%
They visited Earth.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Different species of
them have visited Earth.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.570 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
open a Pandora's box

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.170 align:middle line:84%
because now the public wants
to know every single thing

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:84%
that they've provided to us,
and a lot of that information

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.900 align:middle line:90%
we can't provide back.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, who's in charge of the
technologies that are derived

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.890 align:middle line:90%
from these UAPs?

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the government
has DARPA, number one.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.050 align:middle line:10%
They're doing the
reverse engineering.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:10%
Number two, the
particular agency

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.770 align:middle line:10%
within the Department of Defense
is who would utilize that.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:84%
But the problem we have
here is contractors.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.660 align:middle line:90%
Civilian contractors--

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>> It's funneled out
to these corporations.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.900 align:middle line:84%
The information and the
technology to analyze

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.460 align:middle line:84%
is filtered out to
Honeywell and Grumman--

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Raytheon.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Raytheon, Lockheed--

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin Marietta, Skunk Works,
and they don't have to share

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.040 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't realize
that the FOIA law, Title V

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.800 align:middle line:84%
United States Code
Freedom of Information Act

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.780 align:middle line:84%
only pertains to
governmental agencies.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.450 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't pertain to
civilian contractors.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So you can't submit
a FOIA request

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.600 align:middle line:84%
to Honeywell, or to Raytheon,
or to Tektronix, or Johnsons

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Systems and get information
about reverse engineering.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And who's in charge of the
messaging of this narrative

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.420 align:middle line:90%
of what's being told?

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.460 align:middle line:90%
Who is?

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.260 align:middle line:90%
Who's in charge?

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>> How many are
involved with that?

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.200 align:middle line:90%
How many?

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.620 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
entities, as I said earlier.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Who's actually in charge?

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.073 align:middle line:84%
And most people would say,
well, the president is.

00:07:08.073 --> 00:07:09.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the
president would.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.030 align:middle line:84%
He's a temporary employee of
the United States government.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.180 align:middle line:84%
There's such a thing as the
advanced operations working

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.940 align:middle line:84%
groups, which we understand
took over for MJ-12.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.870 align:middle line:84%
That entity, it's
not a different--

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.210 align:middle line:90%
it's not a particular agency.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:29.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just an entity within the
government, a quasi division

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:90%
or a branch of our government.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.860 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
the ones that are

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.890 align:middle line:84%
dictating policy and procedures
at this present time.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And I would think that
they would probably

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.790 align:middle line:84%
dictate how
disclosure would begin

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and the administrative process
of getting that disclosure out.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So the question about
disclosure goes actually way

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:59.230 align:middle line:84%
back because the possibility
and the question about when,

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:04.300 align:middle line:84%
how has always
existed from 1947 on.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.800 align:middle line:84%
It worked for quite some time
to make everything a secret.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.930 align:middle line:84%
But say about 15 years
ago, the discussion

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.930 align:middle line:84%
got more and more
into the direction

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:21.900 align:middle line:84%
of how can we disclose
some of the stuff

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:29.520 align:middle line:84%
because the reasons for
disclosure more and more turned

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:35.700 align:middle line:84%
to the direction of it
is beneficial, maybe even

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:40.049 align:middle line:84%
needed to do so, in
order to rearrange

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:42.480 align:middle line:84%
the whole global
system in some way

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.830 align:middle line:84%
that it's effectively fit into
the situation of an open world

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:48.630 align:middle line:90%
scenario.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, is that a collective
group around the world,

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.990 align:middle line:84%
or you're specifically talking
about a specific country

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.980 align:middle line:90%
or agency?

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we've got to
go back in time then.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.100 align:middle line:84%
We have to see what is
history, what happened,

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.270 align:middle line:90%
and what situation do we have?

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.860 align:middle line:84%
We have a situation where,
at least in the '80s,

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.600 align:middle line:84%
'90s, the USA, United
States of America,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.050 align:middle line:84%
weren't the only
country anymore that had

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:90%
extensive knowledge about UFOs.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.600 align:middle line:84%
At the time of the '90s,
there were a couple

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.110 align:middle line:84%
of countries, private
contractors all

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.740 align:middle line:84%
around the globe, but
also powerful families

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and certain other groups
had extensive knowledge

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.130 align:middle line:90%
about what's going on.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And each and every one of them,
if they had the resources,

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:45.780 align:middle line:84%
they created their own
fleet of their own group.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.220 align:middle line:90%
Rick said it correctly.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Look at how many key players
you have only in this country.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.460 align:middle line:84%
CIA, DIA, and many,
many, many more.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And now think that there are
more than the United States.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.630 align:middle line:84%
There are other
countries that might have

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:middle line:90%
the same situation going on.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.880 align:middle line:84%
So there was an effort
mainly started by--

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.860 align:middle line:84%
the United States
Navy was pretty much

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.490 align:middle line:84%
one of them who pushed
the effort to bring people

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:22.290 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And the way I
understand it, there

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:31.440 align:middle line:84%
were some very intense meetings
of certain representatives

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.880 align:middle line:84%
of military brands, countries,
groups, companies, and so on.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And what then happened,
because, of course, they

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:84%
had their agendas and they were
fighting it in these meetings--

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:51.240 align:middle line:84%
actually, the governments,
which then is the next in line,

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.690 align:middle line:84%
wrote certain exit strategies,
how to move from one situation

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:57.490 align:middle line:90%
to the other.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people,
tactical advisors

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:06.240 align:middle line:84%
wrote stuff and gave these
papers into those meetings,

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and those people
then arranged how

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:16.030 align:middle line:84%
disclosure is going to look,
and that's currently going on.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is disclosure
such a polarizing topic?

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, something that
Tim just mentioned,

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.820 align:middle line:84%
there's so many different
hands in the pot, so to speak.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.652 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
you do in intelligence--

00:11:30.652 --> 00:11:32.610 align:middle line:84%
positive intelligence--
there's different types

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:84%
of intelligence-- positive,
counterintelligence,

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.450 align:middle line:90%
counterespionage.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.790 align:middle line:84%
One of the things you
look at is something

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.740 align:middle line:84%
we call essential
elements of information.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.010 align:middle line:84%
What do we want
from our enemies?

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And one of the top priorities
during the late '70s

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.370 align:middle line:84%
and early '80s, at
least when I was in,

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:84%
was information
about UFO programs.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:57.870 align:middle line:84%
That was a highly classified
entity within the EEIs.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:02.340 align:middle line:84%
So we would task our spies
within the Soviet Union,

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.470 align:middle line:84%
within East Germany back
then, Czechoslovakia

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and other countries,
and even China,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.430 align:middle line:90%
for that type of information.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:13.530 align:middle line:84%
We also, our friends, our German
friends, West German friends

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:17.880 align:middle line:84%
or the Italians and the
French, the South Africans, we

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.170 align:middle line:84%
knew they were all involved
in the same program.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it was easier to
get information from our spies

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.290 align:middle line:84%
inside the Soviet
Union than it was

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:84%
for something that was
being closely hidden

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.460 align:middle line:84%
within the West
German government

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.720 align:middle line:90%
or the French government.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they got something.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.430 align:middle line:84%
They have information about
UFOs, about ET contacts,

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.040 align:middle line:84%
and they want to analyze it
first before they share it

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.450 align:middle line:90%
with the Americans.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:42.740 align:middle line:90%
And we knew they had it.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.440 align:middle line:84%
We knew it, but we
couldn't always share it.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't conduct covert
or clandestine operations

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.388 align:middle line:90%
against our friends.

00:12:50.388 --> 00:12:52.430 align:middle line:84%
They're our friends, and
we were waiting for them

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:56.510 align:middle line:84%
to open their hands and give
us what they know about UFOs.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.990 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't always happen.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Are there different
branches of our military

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.010 align:middle line:84%
that are on the
same page with this

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:08.030 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to disclosure, or
are they all separated there?

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Navy is more
open about the subject,

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:84%
especially after the USS Nimitz
incident and USS Roosevelt

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.520 align:middle line:84%
incident, and there's been
some other incidents that just

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.460 align:middle line:84%
recently within the last few
months have been disclosed

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:26.990 align:middle line:84%
by the Navy about fighter
planes encountering UAPs over

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:28.830 align:middle line:90%
a particular area.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.370 align:middle line:84%
So the Navy is
probably more open.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>> They seem to be the
most advanced, too,

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:37.160 align:middle line:84%
out of all the branches when
it comes to reverse engineered

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.230 align:middle line:84%
craft and keeping the
secrets of the UFOs.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Each branch has their own
research and development

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.680 align:middle line:84%
because they have a particular
mission within the Department

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.480 align:middle line:90%
of Defense.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.290 align:middle line:84%
The Navy patrols the seas,
the skies out at the seas.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.930 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force patrols
the United States.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:57.140 align:middle line:84%
They protect the United
States, and the US Space Force

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:01.550 align:middle line:84%
is protecting Earth, at
least our part of the Earth.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So everybody has their own
research and development

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.620 align:middle line:90%
projects.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Probably the costliest
is the Air Force

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.860 align:middle line:84%
because they're dealing
with advanced technology

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:17.000 align:middle line:90%
and planes, weapon systems.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.230 align:middle line:84%
The Space Force, they
have 1,600 satellites

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:24.560 align:middle line:84%
that they have to
control that we know of,

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.710 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
probably 2 to 400

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.410 align:middle line:84%
more that we don't know of
that are in classified missions

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:34.370 align:middle line:84%
up there that are
controlled by other entities

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:38.403 align:middle line:84%
within the government, some
that are even classified.

00:14:38.403 --> 00:14:40.820 align:middle line:84%
There's actually agencies--
two agencies as I'm thinking--

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to name
them-- that are classified.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they are elements
of the government.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.340 align:middle line:84%
They call themselves
elements of the government,

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and they control certain
aspects of our space program.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.970 align:middle line:84%
The National Reconnaissance
Office we know about

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.070 align:middle line:90%
because it's been publicized.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Within that realm, there's two
agencies that control things.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.400 align:middle line:90%
One--

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>> So they're below the NRO?

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.820 align:middle line:90%
>> They're below the NRO.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.240 align:middle line:84%
One of them used to be
the Defense Communications

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Agency, the DCA, and
they dealt with all

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.080 align:middle line:84%
the ground-based
satellite, the collection

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.380 align:middle line:84%
of signals coming from
other-- but another agency

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:90%
took that over.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So to answer your
question, the Navy and Army

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.330 align:middle line:90%
are primarily on the list.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:27.890 align:middle line:84%
I would say probably
the Navy's number one,

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.210 align:middle line:90%
the Air Force is number two.

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe the
Army is involved in much

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.710 align:middle line:84%
except for strategy to defend
the ground-based assets

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.350 align:middle line:84%
against some kind
of invasion force.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And then the Marines would
follow that particular scenario

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:44.840 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>> With all the
compartmentalized agencies that

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.470 align:middle line:84%
are out there, Rick, is there
one group or agency that kind

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.960 align:middle line:90%
of heads the whole thing up?

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I would say--

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.048 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
this for a fact,

00:15:57.048 --> 00:15:58.340 align:middle line:90%
but I would guess to say that--

00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Your opinion.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The old MJ-12 group that's
been out there for many years

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's been pretty much
verified that it existed,

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.120 align:middle line:84%
as it changed their
names over the years--

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.630 align:middle line:84%
and I believe now they're called
the Advanced Operations Working

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.970 align:middle line:90%
Group, the AOWG.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
probably the ones that would

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.930 align:middle line:90%
be controlling most of this.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's clarify, too, that it
is not just 12 people sitting

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.952 align:middle line:90%
in the corner.

00:16:25.952 --> 00:16:27.410 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
about-- it's probably

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.480 align:middle line:84%
made up of maybe
corporations and agencies

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.550 align:middle line:90%
and a group of leaders.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly what I was going
to say is this is not just one

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.710 align:middle line:84%
person, or there's
not just 12 people,

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:84%
like MJ-12 allegedly
contained just 12 people.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:46.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a conglomerate of groups,
including private contractors,

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:50.540 align:middle line:84%
military, particular military
branches, and divisions

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.900 align:middle line:84%
within a certain military
that would be controlling.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.730 align:middle line:90%
Because it's complex.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:84%
You can't have one
person making decisions

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.030 align:middle line:84%
that would affect every
branch of the government,

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:05.839 align:middle line:84%
military branches of the
DOD, Department of Defense,

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:08.900 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence agencies,
and other agencies

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.369 align:middle line:90%
within the government.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:15.619 align:middle line:84%
There would have to be some kind
of agreement and group settings

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:19.310 align:middle line:84%
because one particular entity
couldn't dictate everything

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.130 align:middle line:84%
within the United States
government of what

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:90%
they want to do.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.550 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say it's
like a Pandora's box.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
they would do that.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:26.920 align:middle line:90%
I wish I knew.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wish I would be in
a position to know all this.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just
the United States.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.940 align:middle line:90%
It's Germany, Europe.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.110 align:middle line:84%
The European Union
has the same thing.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:38.107 align:middle line:90%
It's the same problem.

00:17:38.107 --> 00:17:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you think, Tim?

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:42.220 align:middle line:84%
What's the group or
individual group out there

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.530 align:middle line:84%
you think is
heading this all up?

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to be visually
appealing to people to imagine

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:54.310 align:middle line:84%
that power structure is
functioning in a way that

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:84%
there's something on top of it,
like one thing concentrates all

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:00.430 align:middle line:90%
the power.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:04.720 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, we see that
agendas and key players

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.320 align:middle line:84%
are so diverse and there
are so many of them

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:13.610 align:middle line:84%
that it's more or less a
kind of a dynamic process.

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So someone is at the top
for some period of time

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.270 align:middle line:90%
but gets replaced.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And the more key
players you have,

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.630 align:middle line:90%
the greater those dynamics are.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:32.140 align:middle line:84%
So the greatest
balancing acts that we

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.890 align:middle line:84%
have to do is not only bringing
all those people together

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:42.190 align:middle line:84%
on one table, but also
arranging some kind of plan

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:84%
where everyone can agree
upon it for a mutually

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:52.520 align:middle line:84%
beneficial situation, and
that is the real challenge.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So with all the clandestine
agencies out here that have

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:59.530 align:middle line:84%
the ability in the United States
to reverse engineer downed

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.670 align:middle line:84%
craft and things like this,
maybe we do have these

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:02.470 align:middle line:90%
treaties.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.030 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we have these agreements.

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:08.360 align:middle line:84%
What about the other countries
out there, China and Europe?

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Do they have agreements
where they're

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:17.290 align:middle line:84%
allowed to keep downed craft
and exchange technologies

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.670 align:middle line:90%
and reverse engineering it?

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard
anything like this?

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can tell you
that during my time in--

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.810 align:middle line:84%
we knew the Soviet Union,
because it was Soviet Union

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:84%
during my time period, they had
a number of Roswell incidents

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:90%
dating back to the '50s--

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.150 align:middle line:90%
early '50s.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest one
was in '67, '68.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.700 align:middle line:90%
They released a film about it.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.910 align:middle line:84%
They found a craft out in the
middle of a particular area

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:47.560 align:middle line:90%
of Soviet Union.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.900 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
the Soviets did was they

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.370 align:middle line:90%
kept everything secret.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Everything compartmentalized
and kept that secret.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Even today-- and there's
been scientific expeditions

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:84%
after the Soviet Union
fell and became Russia,

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and Russia is not giving up
any information about it.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about China.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:14.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't have much information
about what's happened in China.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.980 align:middle line:84%
I was never briefed
in anything like that.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:17.980 align:middle line:90%
One of the things that--

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.290 align:middle line:84%
South America-- we have
great working relationships

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.180 align:middle line:90%
with Brazil, Argentina.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.120 align:middle line:84%
When a craft crashes
down there, they

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.440 align:middle line:84%
call us because they don't
know what to do with it.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Chile, Colombia had a
craft, and even Costa Rica off

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:35.980 align:middle line:84%
the coast that we went down
there and recovered for them.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.730 align:middle line:84%
But around Europe,
I think Tim would

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.890 align:middle line:90%
have to be the expert on that.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so basically
we know that Russia has,

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.970 align:middle line:84%
after the United
States of America,

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.000 align:middle line:84%
the longest history
on UFO topics.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.570 align:middle line:84%
They basically have
a huge Space Force

00:20:55.570 --> 00:21:00.530 align:middle line:84%
as the United States
of America as well.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:03.190 align:middle line:84%
But we also have-- and we
need to keep that in mind-- we

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:08.500 align:middle line:84%
have some smaller countries that
also have certain incidents,

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and they found something,
and they build something.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:15.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you're thinking
about Africa, for example,

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.190 align:middle line:84%
they don't have the
resources to build something

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:22.240 align:middle line:84%
like a huge brand, like the
United States of America,

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:26.380 align:middle line:84%
who has biggest military
budget in the whole world,

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.020 align:middle line:84%
more than other
countries combined.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:34.720 align:middle line:84%
What they did, for example,
is they reached out

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.240 align:middle line:84%
to other African
countries, and they

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:43.480 align:middle line:84%
got their resources piled
up and did what they could.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Then you have certain families
and other influential groups

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:55.810 align:middle line:84%
on this planet who might have
enough resources to research

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:57.500 align:middle line:90%
certain things.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's basically, I
guess, the differences

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.760 align:middle line:90%
in the countries.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it would be
almost impossible for one--

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>> One entity, one person
on Earth that could speak

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.190 align:middle line:90%
for everyone else.

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:15.410 align:middle line:84%
We have the United Nations,
but they don't do a whole lot.

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:19.483 align:middle line:84%
And I know in 2017, with ATIP
when that story came out,

00:22:19.483 --> 00:22:21.650 align:middle line:84%
there were a number of
speeches given at the General

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Assembly at the United
Nations about what

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.800 align:middle line:84%
the number of countries
being interested--

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Israel made a speech,
South Africa made a speech,

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Turkey made a great
presentation and hinted

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:41.510 align:middle line:84%
that they knew what the
subject was and knew something

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:43.670 align:middle line:84%
about it, but they
never explained it.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So like Tim said, there's
smaller countries.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure Turkey probably has
had some kind of UFO incident

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.930 align:middle line:90%
that they haven't revealed yet.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Maybe our US intelligence
knows about it

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:58.970 align:middle line:84%
or German BND knows about
it or some other agency

00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:59.840 align:middle line:90%
knows about it.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.910 align:middle line:84%
There are certain countries that
do things better than others.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.570 align:middle line:84%
The Central Intelligence
Agency, although they're

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.820 align:middle line:84%
the biggest intelligence
agency in the world,

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:84%
they don't always do things
as good as the [GERMAN],, which

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:17.450 align:middle line:84%
is the German BND or the
German equivalent of the CIA.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:20.840 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of times that
when I worked in intelligence,

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:84%
we would rely on BND
to gather something

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:26.450 align:middle line:90%
for us that we couldn't gather.

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:28.670 align:middle line:84%
That's the same with
Israeli intelligence.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:32.330 align:middle line:84%
They're probably one of the
most covert operating teams

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:34.370 align:middle line:84%
in the world and
they do it great.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And when we're dealing
with a subject of UFOs,

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:38.750 align:middle line:84%
there's so many
different countries

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:84%
when you ask them about,
OK, what do you know,

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.490 align:middle line:90%
their mouths shut immediately.

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that they may
have something little

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.330 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want
to disclose it to us.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.580 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
example I have.

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.390 align:middle line:84%
When I was at Area 51,
they brought in some people

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:57.710 align:middle line:90%
from other countries.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Germany-- they
brought in a scientist

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:84%
from [GERMAN],, which is the
communications-- probably

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.330 align:middle line:84%
the equivalent to Motorola
in the United States.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.220 align:middle line:84%
They were experts
in communications,

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.200 align:middle line:84%
radio communications
and things like that.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.540 align:middle line:90%
And this is in the '80s.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.970 align:middle line:84%
They were given access
to some information

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.400 align:middle line:84%
about some advanced
communications

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.110 align:middle line:90%
that we got from the ETs.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:22.100 align:middle line:84%
So we did share some things with
[GERMAN],, but only narrowly,

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:26.060 align:middle line:84%
compartmented, dealing
with one specific thing,

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.070 align:middle line:90%
and that was communications.

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there specific
extraterrestrial species out

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:84%
there that are aligned
specifically for certain

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.380 align:middle line:90%
countries?

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we've seen is that
certain ET intelligence try

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:45.440 align:middle line:84%
their best in order to
balance out certain--

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Like stay neutral?

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, do they stay neutral
by acting, I wouldn't say so.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.750 align:middle line:10%
I would say that they
try their best in order

00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:03.120 align:middle line:10%
to find a kind of balance to
the situation going on globally.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.140 align:middle line:10%
So if we go back
in time, then we

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:10.460 align:middle line:10%
know that Germany
in the World War II,

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.950 align:middle line:10%
they developed
certain technology.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.740 align:middle line:84%
They had extensive
research programs

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:84%
and were looking
into the material.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So we know 1947,
Operation Highjump,

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.680 align:middle line:84%
something came up
from Antarctica,

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:33.410 align:middle line:84%
something described as
a disk-shaped object.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:39.470 align:middle line:84%
A lot of indications that this
could be German technology.

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.740 align:middle line:84%
We've seen the incident
in Washington--

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.010 align:middle line:90%
might be in the '50s, I guess?

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>> '52.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>> '52?

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:46.750 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So there are, again, there
are indications that this

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:52.950 align:middle line:90%
might be German as well.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:26:02.780 align:middle line:10%
So basically until
1947, Germany,

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.030 align:middle line:10%
meaning the World
War II Germany,

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:11.420 align:middle line:10%
was the only country that seemed
to have had certain technology.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:19.580 align:middle line:84%
We assume that the so-called
Roswell crash wasn't

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:24.170 align:middle line:84%
a real crash but was
started or forced

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.570 align:middle line:84%
so that the United
States of America

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:84%
could get their hands
on certain technology

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:31.710 align:middle line:90%
to balance out the situation.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:36.296 align:middle line:90%
So what do we know?

00:26:36.296 --> 00:26:40.280 align:middle line:84%
I know you have done some
research on the Roswell

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.970 align:middle line:84%
incident, and the
official theory

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:46.610 align:middle line:84%
was that there's a
thunderstorm going on.

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:49.490 align:middle line:84%
But later on, we
learned that there

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:55.070 align:middle line:84%
are some ETs that can indeed
manipulate weather and use

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:59.180 align:middle line:84%
certain concentrated energy
beams that might look natural

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:02.450 align:middle line:90%
but might be more like a weapon.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Because if we see the
Ebens visited this planet

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.910 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:14.030 align:middle line:84%
So they had advanced technology,
they know the terrain,

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.530 align:middle line:90%
they know the weather.

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:18.770 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of unlikely
that a thunderstorm

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:22.770 align:middle line:84%
could bring them down, which
hasn't happened ever before.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:27.710 align:middle line:84%
So there is this theory that
another species we know of

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:30.200 align:middle line:84%
could have brought
them down and made

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.100 align:middle line:84%
it look naturally so that
the United States could get

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:38.930 align:middle line:84%
their hands on-- and certainly,
the same things happened

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.240 align:middle line:84%
in Russia and later on in
different other countries.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.530 align:middle line:84%
So it basically
happened the same way

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:51.560 align:middle line:84%
the distribution of the
nuclear bomb was done.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.130 align:middle line:84%
The United States of
America had it first,

00:27:55.130 --> 00:28:00.140 align:middle line:84%
and then Russia, and
suddenly some other places,

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:05.090 align:middle line:84%
this technology appeared as
well and that kept peace.

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's a narrative of
a threat that we hear about

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.570 align:middle line:90%
the UAP phenomena.

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, do you believe
there's a threat from them?

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do.

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I believed everything that
was presented to President

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Reagan back in 1981.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Caspar Weinberger, he believed
it back in the early '70s.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.660 align:middle line:84%
He so mentioned it
and wrote about it.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.650 align:middle line:84%
I think there was a
threat at that time,

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:31.040 align:middle line:84%
and I think probably there
is still a threat now.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.570 align:middle line:84%
If I was able to get into
every particular filing

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.240 align:middle line:84%
cabinet in the Pentagon that
dealt with this subject,

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:41.390 align:middle line:84%
I think you'd find or I
would find information

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:43.850 align:middle line:90%
about a threat posed against us.

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Because we're spending
billions of dollars on

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.620 align:middle line:90%
advanced weaponry right now.

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we have-- and I'm not
going to go to great detail--

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:54.680 align:middle line:84%
but I know we have some
very advanced weapons that's

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.780 align:middle line:84%
not going to be used
against a country.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.790 align:middle line:84%
It was going to be
used against something

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:01.130 align:middle line:84%
else, some other entity,
and that other entity

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:04.490 align:middle line:84%
is going to be something
coming from outer space.

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, I also believe
that most of the ETs,

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.850 align:middle line:84%
at least that I
knew existed back

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:12.590 align:middle line:90%
in the '80s-- '70s and '80s--

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:13.700 align:middle line:90%
were benevolent.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.090 align:middle line:90%
They weren't here to harm us.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:22.340 align:middle line:84%
But there are some, at least one
particular one, that came here,

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.340 align:middle line:84%
and for some reason,
they want to conquer

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.860 align:middle line:84%
or there was some
sort of a threat.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>> When the government
rebranded the UFO to UAPs,

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:34.140 align:middle line:84%
it's basically they're
saying it is a threat.

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.370 align:middle line:84%
This is the narrative they've
been giving us for a while now.

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Is there a threat
out there, Rick?

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, there is.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.330 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there
is a threat out there.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you look at and
speak with the intelligence

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:48.920 align:middle line:84%
officers that I have
and military people

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.590 align:middle line:84%
that are still within the
government and a lot of them

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:54.350 align:middle line:84%
that have retired, the first
thing they'll talk about

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:55.940 align:middle line:90%
is the threat.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:00.830 align:middle line:84%
As Tim talked about, the
hostile, the aggressive ETs

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.240 align:middle line:90%
that had come here.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:06.470 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that we
as humans don't understand

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:10.190 align:middle line:84%
is that we can't understand
what their thinking is.

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:12.080 align:middle line:90%
We can't understand their plans.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.670 align:middle line:90%
They're a different species.

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.500 align:middle line:84%
They're biologically
different than us.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Their brains are
different than us.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:19.170 align:middle line:90%
Their thinkings are different.

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:20.810 align:middle line:90%
The rationale is different.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.660 align:middle line:84%
So to sit there
and say, well, they

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.240 align:middle line:90%
came here to do a particular--

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.680 align:middle line:90%
are they dangerous?

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because
they've shown danger.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.970 align:middle line:90%
I can talk about probably--

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>> What have they shown that
makes them dangerous, Rick?

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I could talk about five
different incidents involving

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:42.170 align:middle line:84%
aggressive actions that ETs
have taken towards United States

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:47.960 align:middle line:84%
airplanes, civilians
driving around in a vehicle,

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.660 align:middle line:90%
abductions, and disappearances.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:55.910 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that people
don't connect the UAP phenomena

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:59.420 align:middle line:84%
with is the disappearance
of millions of people

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.930 align:middle line:90%
around the Earth every year.

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, there's just an
enormous amount of people go

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:09.770 align:middle line:84%
missing in particular areas
such as Alaska, Oregon,

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and Southern Washington
State, Northern California.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:14.290 align:middle line:90%
I can go on and on.

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:15.915 align:middle line:84%
>> No one talks about
it, though, Rick,

00:31:15.915 --> 00:31:17.280 align:middle line:90%
and no one correlates the two.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I'm even
hesitant about it.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know a lot about that,
but it's kind of a scary topic.

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:26.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't want to leave
anybody on a cliffhanger here,

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.090 align:middle line:84%
but I don't want to talk
about that because there's

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:30.200 align:middle line:90%
a lot of things so scary.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.360 align:middle line:90%
And then there's the unknown.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.100 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
they're doing.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.220 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where are
they taking these people.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:40.220 align:middle line:84%
We don't know for a fact
they did, although there's

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.400 align:middle line:84%
numerous cases
where people, police

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:48.050 align:middle line:84%
officers, military
people seen this occur,

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:53.700 align:middle line:84%
that actually witnessed
humans being taken missing

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.500 align:middle line:90%
and they've never showed up.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So would I consider
that a threat?

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:00.240 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely a threat.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, another thing
about the name--

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:08.790 align:middle line:84%
during my time period, we
had UFOs, Unidentified Flying

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:09.590 align:middle line:90%
Object.

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Then classification-wise, we had
Identified Alien Craft, IACs.

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:18.170 align:middle line:84%
We knew this
particular craft are

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:20.870 align:middle line:84%
flown by this particular
species of ETs,

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:23.990 align:middle line:84%
so they were
identified alien craft.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Unidentified Alien Craft we had.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:30.230 align:middle line:84%
UAP wasn't even
in our vocabulary

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:32.990 align:middle line:90%
back in the '70s and '80s.

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:37.370 align:middle line:84%
It was developed by one
particular person created

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:41.870 align:middle line:84%
this, who you see on TV now
talking about the phenomena.

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And they're pushing
for disclosure

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.490 align:middle line:84%
because they
consider it a threat.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Harry Reid was-- the late Harry
Reid was doing the same thing.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.390 align:middle line:84%
The problem there
is, they don't want

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:54.890 align:middle line:84%
to go back and talk about the
real threat that occurred back

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:55.700 align:middle line:90%
in history.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.220 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
talk historically.

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:01.430 align:middle line:84%
That turns off
hundreds and maybe even

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.190 align:middle line:84%
thousands of military and
intelligence officers.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.820 align:middle line:90%
They walk away from it.

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.780 align:middle line:84%
My group, they didn't want any
part of this new disclosure

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.540 align:middle line:84%
program because you're not
going to disclose everything.

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the people, the American

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:16.340 align:middle line:90%
Society, because we--

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.750 align:middle line:90%
and I have to be--

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:21.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm guilty of this-- we have
disinformed the American people

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:23.270 align:middle line:84%
over the years on
different things

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:25.730 align:middle line:84%
and different
disinformation campaigns.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:27.530 align:middle line:90%
So who are they going to trust?

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to
trust the government?

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.810 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you think, Tim?

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people could say if
something is about to happen,

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:41.990 align:middle line:84%
it would have already
happened by now.

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And I would reply
that, yes, there

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:51.860 align:middle line:84%
is no major threat
happening in the way

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:55.310 align:middle line:84%
that it threatens the
existence of this planet.

00:33:55.310 --> 00:34:00.080 align:middle line:84%
But Rick refers correctly
to certain smaller incidents

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:04.910 align:middle line:84%
where people got
threatened or attacked

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:09.320 align:middle line:84%
by certain other
aggressive, hostile species.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And we definitely see
that the whole system

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.300 align:middle line:84%
that we are dealing
with globally today

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:22.909 align:middle line:84%
is something that
has been ridiculously

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:26.989 align:middle line:84%
thought out and
placed here in a way

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:30.739 align:middle line:90%
that it should harass humanity.

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Where do you believe humanity
will be with a more open

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.850 align:middle line:90%
disclosure scenario?

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>> We would be a
more open society,

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:44.400 align:middle line:84%
not just here in the United
States but all over the world.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.130 align:middle line:84%
There would be a lot of
discussions opened up

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:51.900 align:middle line:84%
because now we know
and now the humans know

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.109 align:middle line:90%
that we've had contact.

00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.909 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And of course, you've
got the other side of it.

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:58.740 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
harmful in some respect

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.477 align:middle line:90%
to some segments of society.

00:35:01.477 --> 00:35:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you think, Tim?

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the biggest milestone
that I personally am thrilled

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:15.520 align:middle line:84%
to manifest and to attract as
fast as possible is the removal

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:21.700 align:middle line:84%
of the so-called travel embargo,
which keeps humans more or less

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.550 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:28.150 align:middle line:10%
A very low amount of
people has the opportunity

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:32.080 align:middle line:10%
to go out into space
and see other worlds.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:37.030 align:middle line:84%
But the whole planet will
eventually go interplanetary

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:42.040 align:middle line:84%
at some time, and that's
when bigger groups

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and certain other
people can travel.

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think the possibility to
explore other species' planets

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.790 align:middle line:84%
and especially civilizations,
it will definitely

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:59.120 align:middle line:84%
turn around Earth, and
I'm hoping for that.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And I know there are some plans
for that, and I can't wait.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>> What a great
"Disclosure" episode.

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Rick, I want to thank you
for being on the show.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:11.767 align:middle line:84%
>> And Tim, it's always
a pleasure having you.

00:36:11.767 --> 00:36:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:18.190 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Next, on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:26.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Some thousands of years ago,
Antarctica wasn't an ice place,

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:29.200 align:middle line:10%
but it was quite Mediterranean.

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Potentially the
oldest space port

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:34.840 align:middle line:90%
is said to be found down there.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>> There was a portal--

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.940 align:middle line:84%
a time portal in Antarctica--
and the first expedition

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:43.060 align:middle line:84%
that actually found a pyramid
went through that portal

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:44.590 align:middle line:90%
into some other dimension.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:47.340 align:middle line:90%
