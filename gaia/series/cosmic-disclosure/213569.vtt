>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.110 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty, a
retired Special Agent who served

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.650 align:middle line:10%
in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.580 align:middle line:90%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Today we discussed chemtrails
and their connection

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.550 align:middle line:90%
to the UAPs.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.820 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Richard.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.240 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.698 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, what
are chemtrails?

00:00:39.698 --> 00:00:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And what's their
connection to these UAPS?

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, chemtrails have
been around for a long time.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.820 align:middle line:90%
People see them in the air.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.710 align:middle line:84%
They've been reported through
the Air Force, through the FAA.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Letters have been sent to
congressmen and senators.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.820 align:middle line:84%
This goes on and on, and it's
been going on for a long time.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: For a decade.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.370 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: At least a decade.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:84%
There's been a lot written
about why they're up

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.480 align:middle line:84%
there, the benefits
of these chemtrails,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.260 align:middle line:84%
to protect the
planet from radiation

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.820 align:middle line:84%
or from hazardous materials
coming in from space.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.120 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole article
written about that,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.950 align:middle line:84%
about the dangers of the carbon
emissions, protecting them.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's a number
of other things.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rebuilding
the ozone layer.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Rebuilding
the ozone layer,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.290 align:middle line:84%
effectively putting a screen
up to protect the ozone layer.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.850 align:middle line:84%
All these things have been
written about these chemtrails.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.490 align:middle line:84%
But in actuality,
there's another reason

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.855 align:middle line:84%
why those chemtrails
were put up there.

00:01:48.855 --> 00:01:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, why were
they put up there, Richard?

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The United
States government

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:84%
created a material
and gases used

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:84%
to detect when an
extraterrestrial craft enters

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.550 align:middle line:84%
a certain layer
of our atmosphere.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.789 align:middle line:84%
And if they put these chemtrails
up there, which spreads out,

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.800 align:middle line:84%
now we from the planet
look up and only see part,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.890 align:middle line:90%
sees some of the chemtrail.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:90%
They don't see all of it.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Because as these
planes disperse,

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.370 align:middle line:84%
this particular chemical
or gases actually

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.770 align:middle line:84%
that have these
little tag-its in it,

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.910 align:middle line:84%
they spread out in
a large, large area.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And that stays up there
for some time period

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.420 align:middle line:84%
because there's less wind up at
that altitude to disperse them.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And some of the gases
are heavier than air.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
is when a UFO

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.530 align:middle line:84%
comes through that, those
little tag-its sendoff

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.250 align:middle line:84%
messages to ground
stations, indicating

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.310 align:middle line:84%
that an extraterrestrial craft
came in at that particular place

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.590 align:middle line:90%
in our planet.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.578 align:middle line:84%
That's what chemtrails
are used for.

00:03:02.578 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you
explain for the audience

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:90%
what a tag-it is, Richard?

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: A tag-it
is a small piece

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:84%
of a communications, a
signaling device that you

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
can send a signal
or receive a signal

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.390 align:middle line:90%
or bounce a signal off it.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:84%
It's also-- emits a
particular frequency, where

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.090 align:middle line:90%
you can track something on.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:90%
And we use that.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.020 align:middle line:90%
We've used them for years.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: In fact, SWAT
teams or police officers

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.640 align:middle line:90%
have them on their back.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.810 align:middle line:84%
So the dispatcher
can monitor wherever

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.820 align:middle line:84%
the officer is during a
SWAT or some police action.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.180 align:middle line:90%
Firemen have it.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Our special ops
teams, we all wore those.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.587 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So the satellites can
see exactly where we're at,

00:03:44.587 --> 00:03:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and we can have a
head count in seconds.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Exactly the same way
with a fireman, especially

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.220 align:middle line:84%
the hazardous material
response teams.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Those hazmat guys have to
dress in these lovely suits.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.540 align:middle line:90%
They have them on.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.340 align:middle line:90%
So that's what a tag-it is.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do we
know what chemicals

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.170 align:middle line:90%
the chemtrails are made out of?

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And do they put those
chemicals in all jet fuel?

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They're dispersed
through a number

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.350 align:middle line:90%
of different ways.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.040 align:middle line:84%
The actual chemicals
are classified,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:90%
but there are some argon gas.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.019 align:middle line:84%
Argon gas seems to
be something that

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.899 align:middle line:84%
will retain these little
tag-its that are up there,

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:90%
and there are other gases used.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:84%
But again, they're
all classified.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.880 align:middle line:84%
But they do inject them
into the atmosphere

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.130 align:middle line:84%
through aviation fuel, through
cylinders or canisters that

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.990 align:middle line:84%
are placed up in the
atmosphere by our planes, both

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:84%
a military planes and
military contract planes.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.270 align:middle line:90%
They have to be high altitude.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:84%
They have to be dispersed at an
altitude of about 45,000 and not

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.260 align:middle line:90%
anything lower.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, they can make
them go higher than that.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.530 align:middle line:84%
About 50,000 feet is
where they want it to be.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And they can stay up there for
a period of from 15 to 30 days.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:84%
But when they start dissipating,
then they have to go back up

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.670 align:middle line:84%
and replant, replenish
the chemtrails.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, another thing
that we found out

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.190 align:middle line:84%
is that there are certain places
that these ETs come in from.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.760 align:middle line:84%
They don't come in from all over
different places on our planet.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:84%
There are certain places,
and we've detected that

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:90%
by ground-based radars.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.400 align:middle line:84%
We've studied this
for 40 to 50 years.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.510 align:middle line:84%
So we figured out where
these things are being seen

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.150 align:middle line:84%
or where these things are
being tracked by the satellites

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.650 align:middle line:84%
we have in orbit, that can track
them coming into our atmosphere

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:84%
and where they're coming in
from and where they're going to.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where
the concentration

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.790 align:middle line:84%
of these chemtrails
are being deployed.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And again, they go out
from thousands of miles.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.540 align:middle line:84%
We look up and see, and it
appears that they're only

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.400 align:middle line:84%
in maybe a 100-mile area,
but actually they spread out

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.260 align:middle line:90%
to about 1,000 miles.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So where are
these hotspots of activity

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.260 align:middle line:90%
located around the planet?

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Where are all this high volume
of UAP traffic is coming into?

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, I'm not going
to go into any classified,

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.430 align:middle line:84%
at least what I think
might be classified.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.930 align:middle line:84%
But where they're most
cited is over places

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.190 align:middle line:84%
like Southern California,
the Pacific, what

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:84%
they call the eastern
rim of the Pacific,

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.510 align:middle line:84%
along the Coast of
California, in an area west

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:50.200 align:middle line:84%
of Panama Canal Zone and
places around South Africa.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's probably
other places,

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.370 align:middle line:84%
but you got to be careful,
what I've read and compared it

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.090 align:middle line:84%
to what I've been
told by people when

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.570 align:middle line:90%
I was outside the government.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.210 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want to
give away any secrets.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why they would
be secrets, but they are.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.760 align:middle line:84%
If there's classification
on it, you've

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.500 align:middle line:84%
got to be careful
to what you say.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is this because of
these underwater facilities

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.330 align:middle line:90%
that are out there?

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: That is a factor
that we have to look into.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
government already has.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm almost positive
the government knows

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:84%
where most of these underground
facilities are under the ocean.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't know for a fact, but
I talked to former submarine

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:42.380 align:middle line:84%
commanders, former admirals
who talk about where they've

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.950 align:middle line:84%
seen them as they were
navigating their submarines

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.320 align:middle line:90%
under the ocean.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Satellites we have now, they
can view deep within the ocean.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.820 align:middle line:84%
We used to have satellites
that can see within 200 feet

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.390 align:middle line:84%
underground from
under the ocean.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Now we have them that can see
20,000 feet under the ocean.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And what they're finding
or what they're seeing

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.400 align:middle line:84%
is strictly controlled by the
National Reconnaissance Office.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now,
Europe is blanketed

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:18.540 align:middle line:84%
with all these chemtrails, and
so is Toronto in Canada there.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Could we consider
these as hotspots?

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.337 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I would say
yes, although again, I

00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:25.420 align:middle line:84%
don't know everything there
is to know about them.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it is
highly classified.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.650 align:middle line:84%
But if you see them,
chances are that there's

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:84%
a reason why they're
dispersed, there in that area

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.930 align:middle line:84%
maybe, because
they're expecting--

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Preparing.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --and preparing
for an influx of crafts

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:84%
coming in from our atmosphere
or from outer space,

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.040 align:middle line:90%
or they've already gone through.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:54.730 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, you can anticipate
or speculate on these areas.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.190 align:middle line:90%
I know Europe also has them.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:01.450 align:middle line:84%
I've been to Europe,
and they're all over.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:04.780 align:middle line:84%
From Germany, when I was
in Germany not long ago,

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.340 align:middle line:90%
they're all over Germany.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.640 align:middle line:90%
And they're all over--

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.930 align:middle line:90%
we went to Hungary.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:14.230 align:middle line:84%
They're all over Hungary and
even over the Mediterranean,

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.100 align:middle line:90%
the southern part of Italy.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.890 align:middle line:90%
There has to be a reason.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can only surmise
that the reason is,

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.630 align:middle line:84%
there's an influx of
extraterrestrials coming through

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:23.530 align:middle line:90%
in that area.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So let's talk about
the chemicals in the chemtrails.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Do you think they're
harmful for humans?

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: No, I don't
think they are.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.236 align:middle line:84%
As I understand, they
dissipate into the atmosphere.

00:09:34.236 --> 00:09:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
harmful to the planet,

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
harmful to humans.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:43.690 align:middle line:84%
I think the first generation of
these things, of the chemical,

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:47.170 align:middle line:84%
might have caused some
irritations to humans, that

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.170 align:middle line:90%
were deployed at 25 years ago.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:54.650 align:middle line:84%
But they've developed new
chemicals and new protections.

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the chemicals that
are released by these planes

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.180 align:middle line:84%
or through these drones are
not harmful to the human

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.680 align:middle line:90%
or to the planet.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I heard they were
also biodegradable and organic

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.890 align:middle line:90%
elements.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The newer ones
are biodegradable,

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.268 align:middle line:84%
and they don't harm
the planet at all.

00:10:14.268 --> 00:10:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How did they
learn this technology would

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.640 align:middle line:90%
work with the UAPs?

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: A top scientist
figured out a way

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.990 align:middle line:90%
based on a recovered craft.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:27.950 align:middle line:84%
They used this craft that
they'd recovered to expose it

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:29.600 align:middle line:90%
to different chemicals.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ideas
was to try to track

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:90%
it using these different gases.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And then another
scientist thought, wow,

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.140 align:middle line:84%
if we can do that
here, why don't we

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.990 align:middle line:84%
put something in the
air that can track them

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.260 align:middle line:90%
as they come through?

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.140 align:middle line:84%
We might not be
able to see them,

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.690 align:middle line:84%
but when they come
through this gas,

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.120 align:middle line:84%
they illuminate on
our radar or whatever

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.330 align:middle line:90%
ground stations are detecting.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:56.620 align:middle line:90%
It makes them classified.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.290 align:middle line:84%
They started developing and
experimenting with different

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.620 align:middle line:84%
gases, and they finally
perfected one back

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:07.420 align:middle line:84%
in the '90s that might be a
little irritating to humans.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So over the years, they
developed friendly use

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.310 align:middle line:84%
or friendly type of
gases that doesn't affect

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.100 align:middle line:84%
the human or the
environment, and that's

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.080 align:middle line:90%
what they're deploying today.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how efficient
is this strategy

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.000 align:middle line:90%
to locate these craft?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think for the most
part, nothing's 100% accurate.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I was told

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.640 align:middle line:84%
is, this is the best that we
could do right now because they

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.940 align:middle line:90%
can defy radar.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:43.600 align:middle line:84%
They can defy satellite
systems that tracks aircrafts,

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:90%
but they can't defy this.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.990 align:middle line:84%
They illuminate as
they come through this.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.177 align:middle line:84%
And ironically,
even though we're

00:11:50.177 --> 00:11:52.510 align:middle line:84%
talking about different
technologies and different types

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:55.570 align:middle line:84%
of crafts, every one of them,
this works on almost every one

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:56.370 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.970 align:middle line:90%
And as I was told, not everyone.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:04.110 align:middle line:84%
But the thicker the
gas that's deployed

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.480 align:middle line:84%
as they come through
it, the more accurate

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.780 align:middle line:84%
the detection process is down
in the receiving stations.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.110 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
that just get through

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.640 align:middle line:84%
without us being
able to detect them.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's not 100%.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Right, it's
not specific types.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So basically, you're
saying it can pretty much

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.920 align:middle line:90%
find all types of UAPs.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yes, that's one of
the few detection devices

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:32.940 align:middle line:84%
that we have that can
detect every single types

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.320 align:middle line:84%
of technologies that
are coming through.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's reasons for
that, which are classified.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.420 align:middle line:84%
We don't want that
to be out there.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No, no, no, no.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But there's reasons
that they're able to do that up

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.730 align:middle line:90%
in the atmosphere.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.637 align:middle line:84%
And I may think if a smart
person can figure that out--

00:12:48.637 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What happens
after they're tracked?

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:51.618 align:middle line:90%
What's the next step?

00:12:51.618 --> 00:12:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Once they're
tracked and they

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.500 align:middle line:84%
know where they are
in their atmosphere,

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.740 align:middle line:84%
then we can take some defensive
measurements, defensive actions.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.480 align:middle line:84%
We can then know what
the trajectory is.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And although they can change
it, we can somehow track it.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:09.580 align:middle line:84%
If we have a ground-based
radar system that can first

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.370 align:middle line:84%
identify it as it comes
through the gases,

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.100 align:middle line:84%
then we can project where
that craft is going.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And the ironic part
about it is, and I

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.220 align:middle line:84%
have to be careful
how I say this,

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.357 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of these
things go in the ocean.

00:13:24.357 --> 00:13:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Since the chemtrails are in our
atmosphere and planes are flying

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.600 align:middle line:84%
and birds are flying,
does it throw off

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.760 align:middle line:90%
the ability to track UAPs?

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: No.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Because, number one, the only
planes that fly above 50,000 are

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.210 align:middle line:90%
military planes.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And they fly at
a certain way, we

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.490 align:middle line:90%
can track where they're going.

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:46.820 align:middle line:90%
Birds don't fly that high.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.790 align:middle line:90%
Birds fly at under 11,000 feet.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.070 align:middle line:84%
There's no birds that
fly higher than that.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And so that doesn't
affect birds,

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.860 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't affect any
conventional aircrafts.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, those
chemtrails are safe up there.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.890 align:middle line:84%
For the few military planes
that fly above that altitude,

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.610 align:middle line:84%
the 65,000, 70,000
or 80,000 feet,

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.830 align:middle line:84%
then we are tracking
those planes,

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.780 align:middle line:84%
and we know that there's just
a few, one or two might be.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not like hundreds
of commercial planes

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.550 align:middle line:90%
are flying that high.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Commercial planes
fly at 42,000 feet,

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.310 align:middle line:84%
that's the maximum
high altitude.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, you
said 50,000 feet.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Most civilian aircraft
are around 35,000 feet,

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and people are still seeing
things in the lower altitudes.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:34.990 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I'm talking only about
what's being sprayed at 45,000

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:41.690 align:middle line:90%
to 50,000 feet.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you
see less are gases

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:84%
deployed to detect
extraterrestrial crafts.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:52.450 align:middle line:84%
They're out there for
some other reason.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is using
chemtrails an act

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:56.425 align:middle line:84%
of hostility towards
the extraterrestrials?

00:14:56.425 --> 00:14:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: That's hard to
answer because I don't

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.250 align:middle line:84%
know what the extraterrestrials
think about it

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:04.170 align:middle line:84%
or if they even know
what we're doing.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.270 align:middle line:84%
if they detected
this gas up there,

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.440 align:middle line:84%
there seemed to be
flying through there.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.190 align:middle line:84%
They're not stopping or
they're not avoiding it.

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:13.130 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.360 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how extensive
is the program worldwide?

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: There's a fleet or
squadron of aircrafts, United

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.410 align:middle line:90%
States Air Force aircrafts.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And there are a few from NASA,
too, that deploy this gas.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So we have a specific
squadron just for that.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:33.355 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes, yes.

00:15:33.355 --> 00:15:35.230 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: If they're
using special frequencies

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.230 align:middle line:10%
to track them, why do
we need chemtrails?

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.430 align:middle line:84%
We do have the neutrino
light detector systems.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: We have to have
a first-line defense

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.750 align:middle line:84%
system because they could
come into the atmosphere,

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't know
where to track them.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.660 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't know
where they were.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.770 align:middle line:84%
This gives us a first
identification site

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:58.120 align:middle line:84%
for these UFOs to come
through a particular area

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.650 align:middle line:84%
because we've done
a lot of studies

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:01.960 align:middle line:90%
knowing where these areas are.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So putting this
chemtrail up there,

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.270 align:middle line:84%
put the gas up there,
as they come through,

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:90%
then we're immediately notified.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Whereas before, some
of our ground radars

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.028 align:middle line:84%
couldn't even
detect these things.

00:16:16.028 --> 00:16:17.570 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Correct,
it's not everywhere

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.500 align:middle line:10%
in the planet that
we have protection.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, nothing I
don't think I was clear on

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:28.740 align:middle line:84%
is these tag-its are absorbed
or attached to these UFOs.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.070 align:middle line:90%
That's the point of this.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.930 align:middle line:84%
There's thousands of
these tag-its up there.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And when they come through,
they're attached somehow,

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:38.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that, that's
probably classified,

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.900 align:middle line:84%
to these extraterrestrial
or non-human crafts.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And now we have a detection
device on these crafts.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.250 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Are they using
chemtrails for anything

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.940 align:middle line:10%
other than tracking UAPs?

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Probably,
but I wouldn't know.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't think so.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think these
UAPs could modify their crafts

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.080 align:middle line:90%
to be undetected by chemtrails?

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think
they probably could.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
probably experimenting

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:10.940 align:middle line:84%
with countermeasures that
these crafts could be taken

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:15.380 align:middle line:84%
or making to avoid
detection through this gas.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And only the aliens
would know unless we

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:24.680 align:middle line:84%
found a craft that had some sort
of protection system on board.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And we might have, I
just don't know about it.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think there's
any ramifications for us

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.690 align:middle line:84%
to use this technology against
advanced civilizations?

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: That's a good point.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:36.070 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point, I think.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What's the
long term effects

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.980 align:middle line:84%
of this on extraterrestrial
races and their craft?

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: If they're as
advanced as we think they are,

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:50.900 align:middle line:84%
depending on the race, because
some of them are 10,000,

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.930 align:middle line:84%
we think, and some of them are
100,000 years more advanced than

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:57.800 align:middle line:84%
we are, I think they probably
would have developed some kind

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.760 align:middle line:84%
of a defense mechanism, unless
they just can't detect it

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.830 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.100 align:middle line:84%
But I find that
difficult to believe

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.428 align:middle line:84%
because if they're as
advanced as they are,

00:18:08.428 --> 00:18:09.970 align:middle line:84%
of course, I'm
thinking like a human,

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm not thinking like
them, maybe they just

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.450 align:middle line:84%
don't know what it is, and
they've never experienced

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:16.660 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they
don't know what it is.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.100 align:middle line:90%
And so we're fooling them.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.730 align:middle line:84%
But I think eventually,
they're going to figure it out.

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do the beings that
we're tracking come in peace.?

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think the
majority of them do.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I think the others
have an agenda.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think it's always
a friendly agenda towards us.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:42.250 align:middle line:10%
And I think the more that we do
to perform or develop a defense

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:47.650 align:middle line:10%
mechanism against them,
at least the hostile ones,

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:51.210 align:middle line:10%
I think the more they
might become aggressive.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think
some of them have

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:58.470 align:middle line:84%
homes under the ocean or
cities under the ocean, where

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.270 align:middle line:90%
they live.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:02.160 align:middle line:84%
They travel outside our
atmosphere for a reason, which

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:02.960 align:middle line:90%
we don't know.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have to refuel or
something out near the sun.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And then they come back into our
atmosphere and go into the ocean

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:15.620 align:middle line:84%
and to maybe a city
or where they live.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.470 align:middle line:84%
So the majority of
them probably do.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.110 align:middle line:84%
But there's always
that other few

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:24.490 align:middle line:84%
that are responsible for some
activities against humans,

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:84%
and those are the ones we
have to defend against.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:31.930 align:middle line:84%
But the majority of them, I
believe, come to Earth in peace,

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:36.620 align:middle line:84%
or they may be just visiting
us in peace, observing us.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:40.070 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that come
through that are not,

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:44.407 align:middle line:84%
there are ways that we can track
them and keep our watch on them.

00:19:44.407 --> 00:19:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, it's a great
first line of defense,

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.270 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm glad none of our
chemtrails hurt them in any way.

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:53.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's a good sign.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's great to hear
that everything is organic,

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.230 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't affect
the human body.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.687 align:middle line:84%
Richard, I want to thank
you for coming on the show.

00:20:00.687 --> 00:20:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Great to be here, Emery.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
