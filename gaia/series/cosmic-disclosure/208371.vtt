00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Today, on
"Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.650 align:middle line:10%
we're at an undisclosed
location with Tim.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.600 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in the
covert governance in Germany,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.500 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies in relation

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial groups
and contact with Earth.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Tim, can you talk about how
various species perceive

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:90%
the universe?

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many ways and
levels of perception inside

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.170 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, and it depends
on the level of awareness,

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.890 align:middle line:84%
consciousness,
experience, self-identity,

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.690 align:middle line:84%
dimension frequency,
and cultural.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.840 align:middle line:84%
For example, when you have other
species that are living inside

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:11.170 align:middle line:84%
of the universe and they
are more or less as advanced

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.280 align:middle line:84%
as humans are, if they
have knowledge about Earth

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and if they know a little
bit about society on Earth,

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.670 align:middle line:84%
they wonder a lot why things
are the way they are on Earth.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And even if you have
super aware beings,

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle line:84%
they do not tend
to know everything.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And they might
disagree on something,

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and also they make
mistakes, too.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, their judgment
on how things are on Earth

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.930 align:middle line:84%
is a little off or
a lot off, as well.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So perceiving how
things are, we need

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:84%
to take into consideration that
Earth people are pretty far

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.970 align:middle line:90%
advanced technology-wise.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.660 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
mainstream technology

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.830 align:middle line:84%
but things that are kept
hidden in some darker areas

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:90%
of the planet, so to speak.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.530 align:middle line:84%
But nothing of that
has been used in order

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.220 align:middle line:84%
to benefit the population,
society, or the planet itself.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Because actually, it
makes absolutely no sense

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.250 align:middle line:84%
how and why the situation
on Earth is so as it is.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Everything could
be much smoother.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Everything could
be more harmonious.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Socially, this planet
is not as advanced

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:90%
as people are technology-wise.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.640 align:middle line:90%
And this is one--

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.620 align:middle line:84%
this is kind of
confusing to a lot

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.400 align:middle line:84%
of species that are in
direct contact with Earth.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>> There are people who might
say that we are technologically

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.060 align:middle line:90%
advanced.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.620 align:middle line:84%
But until it can be monetized
properly, it won't be released.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.760 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I've talked to somebody, and
he told me that it takes only

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.280 align:middle line:84%
three days in order to heal
the planet, to cure it,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and to make
everything look good.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.120 align:middle line:90%
And I asked why not?

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Why not do it yet; now?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.640 align:middle line:84%
He told me that it's more worth
to keep things in the back

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.740 align:middle line:84%
and wait for the
right moment in order

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.960 align:middle line:90%
to make it even more worthy.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And also, I think there is kind
of a dilemma in which nobody

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.600 align:middle line:84%
wants to be the first person to
come forward and put technology

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.290 align:middle line:84%
on the market, but everyone
wants to be the second one.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is something very
specific to humans on Earth,

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.820 align:middle line:90%
and it makes--

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.570 align:middle line:84%
it creates some confusion
to a lot of other species.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Compared to other planets
and civilizations in the level

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.940 align:middle line:84%
three or four
zone, where we are,

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.390 align:middle line:84%
are you suggesting humankind
is much less developed than we

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.200 align:middle line:90%
think?

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.000 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Technology-wise, humankind
is pretty good on that level.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Socially, the planet
lacks a lot of experience.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.670 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of division.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And everything could be
more productive, better,

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and smoother if everyone could
agree upon one kind of vision

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.230 align:middle line:90%
for the planet.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.820 align:middle line:84%
But on this planet, we
have elite structures

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.480 align:middle line:84%
that push and pull in
different directions

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:90%
and hinder and block themselves.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So we have a kind of
lose-lose situation,

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.340 align:middle line:84%
compared to other
systems in the universe.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is
something the elites had

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.380 align:middle line:84%
to recognize and to
understand, as well.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, how do you think the
Greys actually perceive us,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.820 align:middle line:84%
like their children, maybe
a pet, an experiment,

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:90%
or something else?

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>> They have their stocks in
humanity, and in some ways,

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.300 align:middle line:84%
they depend on some
people on this planet.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Those are pretty
important to them.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.730 align:middle line:90%
They will always protect.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.840 align:middle line:84%
But they also do
not care if there

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:49.250 align:middle line:84%
are significant losses
within populations

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.960 align:middle line:90%
that they don't benefit from.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.140 align:middle line:90%
So they don't have this empathy.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.410 align:middle line:84%
But there are beings
that are totally empathic

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and caring and
loving for humanity

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.990 align:middle line:84%
and see them as protectable
children or something,

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.430 align:middle line:84%
or brothers and
sisters, maybe even.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>> You've mentioned the Greys
are interested in certain types

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.770 align:middle line:90%
of humans.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.210 align:middle line:84%
What characteristics
do those humans have?

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>> They are mainly interested
in those who they can benefit

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.600 align:middle line:84%
from, which means
those, basically,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:32.890 align:middle line:84%
who have the most stable
potential are those who they

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.730 align:middle line:90%
are interested in.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So we were talking about
the potential of evolution

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.840 align:middle line:84%
on a collective
level, and we also

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.270 align:middle line:84%
talked about that human beings,
they rank pretty high on that.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.080 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of
experience diversity.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:59.440 align:middle line:84%
They tend to become or they
could become pretty advanced

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.210 align:middle line:84%
spiritual and developed
beings as a species,

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:11.020 align:middle line:84%
has individual characters
that some of them stand out.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.660 align:middle line:90%
Like you have some people--

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.700 align:middle line:84%
everyone can learn
how to play piano

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.740 align:middle line:90%
at a certain level or something.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:84%
But there are people who
have a very high potency

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.800 align:middle line:90%
in becoming master players.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And if you put
that in accordance

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.920 align:middle line:84%
to a genetic-based
thinking, then you

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:38.110 align:middle line:84%
might understand how Greys
think on certain individuals.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.410 align:middle line:84%
They do not care if
someone is educated

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:46.150 align:middle line:84%
or someone is super
wise or super strong

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.720 align:middle line:84%
or has great body
characteristics or something.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.890 align:middle line:84%
They only look how
good and how high

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:59.680 align:middle line:84%
is the potency, the potential
of that person in terms

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.980 align:middle line:90%
of evolutionary purpose.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>> You use the term "genetics."

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain how the
role of genetics in humans

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.970 align:middle line:84%
piques the interest
of the Greys?

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not only genetics
because genetics would be

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:18.410 align:middle line:84%
something that they could
artificially influence in some

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.210 align:middle line:90%
ways.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:26.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's more the calculations
of the impact of the encounter.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:32.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you have some people,
some farm people, who get

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:37.090 align:middle line:84%
contacted on an open
road, and they see that.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, they
go public and that

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.470 align:middle line:90%
leads to a new discussion.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And 20 years later,
that case is--

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:53.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- discussed broadly
and something else happens.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:09:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Then there is a high potency
that things will, in any way,

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.030 align:middle line:90%
go the way the Greys want.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So that is a reason why
they could do something.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:14.160 align:middle line:84%
I know that in one case, they
communicated and got in contact

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.140 align:middle line:90%
with a school class.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And they were bringing up
the warnings, because I mean,

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:25.740 align:middle line:84%
it's purely logical that if you
warn somebody about something

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.370 align:middle line:84%
bad to happen that this person
will say, all right, OK.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Then I will go a different way.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.870 align:middle line:90%
And those kids went public.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.220 align:middle line:90%
They were interviewed, even--

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- 30 years
later or something.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:42.660 align:middle line:84%
So the case is still inside
of the collective memory.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.580 align:middle line:84%
But still, even the Greys
are wrong about things,

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.060 align:middle line:90%
and they make mistakes.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:54.750 align:middle line:84%
So the effort they
made to warn people

00:09:54.750 --> 00:10:00.810 align:middle line:84%
had possibly no effect, at
least no mentionable effect

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.360 align:middle line:84%
on the whole system
of the collective.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you speak about the
Zorgons or Draco perception

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.250 align:middle line:90%
of our human reality?

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Phew, so I haven't looked
too deep into that species

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:20.110 align:middle line:84%
and don't want to, but I think
that two things are important.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:24.720 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is that
they know human evolution

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.830 align:middle line:84%
because they have this high
potential that this could

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:90%
be some kind of competition.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.910 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why
they look on Earth,

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.070 align:middle line:90%
on Earthlings like they do.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And I also think that they have
a pretty rough understanding

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:51.440 align:middle line:84%
of amusement and how to
live their kind of lifestyle

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.720 align:middle line:90%
to put it gently.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:11:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And some warrior
types need victims

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:06.150 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of way or
opponents to express themselves.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:11.420 align:middle line:84%
So if you have some, for
example, a boxer or something,

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:84%
if you want to be
a successful boxer,

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.190 align:middle line:84%
you need some opponent
to stand up on.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:84%
So I think that is something
they see in humans.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.070 align:middle line:84%
People on Earth and
military on Earth,

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.750 align:middle line:84%
they have this tendency
to develop weapons

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:34.700 align:middle line:84%
for one certain
scenario, whereas others,

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:41.210 align:middle line:84%
they have a more general
kind of approach to military.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So human people are
very specialized.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.960 align:middle line:84%
They have special forces
for special tasks,

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.920 align:middle line:84%
and when somebody is very
special in something,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.580 align:middle line:84%
he wants a very
special experience.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And this reptilian race has
a kind of similar approach.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:08.810 align:middle line:84%
They also develop special
forces and special warriors

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.220 align:middle line:90%
for special things.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And then they look for
opportunities to try that out,

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.320 align:middle line:90%
to play it out.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>> How do the interfrequentials
view our world?

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And why would such a higher
frequential consciousness

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.670 align:middle line:90%
want to interact with us?

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah, interesting.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:33.710 align:middle line:84%
So higher frequential beings
have a very different approach

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:40.220 align:middle line:84%
to the needs and problems and
challenges to this experience

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.300 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.090 align:middle line:84%
They do want to
heal, and they do

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:84%
want to help and to guide it,
because also, their existence

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:56.020 align:middle line:84%
depends on a healthy and
well-evolving universe

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:59.100 align:middle line:84%
because everything is
connected, but their approach is

00:12:59.100 --> 00:12:59.900 align:middle line:90%
differently.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of people think

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:08.350 align:middle line:84%
when they are so advanced,
why don't they just snap

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.060 align:middle line:90%
and everything will be fine?

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Their perspective on
the challenges on Earth

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:21.500 align:middle line:84%
is way different and not
as practical and hands-on

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.760 align:middle line:84%
as level three and level
four consciousness is.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:84%
If we have, for example,
physicians or doctors medicine

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:35.270 align:middle line:84%
on a level three consciousness,
they see a bone is broken.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.890 align:middle line:90%
So they take something.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:42.230 align:middle line:84%
They make it-- open it
and put in something

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and close it and do
something like that.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Those higher frequential
beings do not have that.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:55.440 align:middle line:84%
They would think why does
that accident, that wound

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.550 align:middle line:84%
appear in that
time on that place,

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:07.560 align:middle line:84%
and what might be the underlying
logic that makes this appear

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.300 align:middle line:90%
in a material universe?

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:15.380 align:middle line:84%
For example, being six
looked upon the challenges

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and problems of the Earth
a lot more philosophically

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:23.150 align:middle line:84%
as the Greys, who
are practically

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:26.180 align:middle line:90%
pretty hands-on and invasive.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:30.770 align:middle line:84%
To being six, everything that
happens here on this planet

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:36.350 align:middle line:84%
has to do something
with the imbalance

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:40.950 align:middle line:90%
of female and male energies.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:47.160 align:middle line:84%
They say that in a previous
version of the universe,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.280 align:middle line:84%
through the stability
of mother love, which

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:56.160 align:middle line:84%
is one of the greatest and
loving and kindest and stable

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:84%
emotions ever, the universe
in a theoretical second

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.570 align:middle line:90%
used to be female.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:84%
But as we all know, the universe
is neither male nor female,

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.780 align:middle line:84%
and male and female and
something else and everything

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:15.580 align:middle line:90%
that you want.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is only a
theoretical second,

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.470 align:middle line:84%
but there are some
problems that occur inside

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:27.870 align:middle line:84%
of time through that experience
outside of this version

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.610 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Let me explain what
they think of it.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:84%
They think that if you
have the mother energy,

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:42.390 align:middle line:84%
taking the child from their
own body and giving life to it,

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:46.260 align:middle line:84%
that is a very caring
and loving energy.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, if we look upon the
father, in the first glimpse,

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:57.100 align:middle line:84%
it seems as if the father is
more divided to the child.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is something that they
see as an imbalance in energy,

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.990 align:middle line:84%
female-male energy that
occurs on this planet,

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:14.260 align:middle line:84%
because in some way or another,
through that imbalance,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:20.470 align:middle line:84%
by dividing something essential,
just thought base, essential

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:30.670 align:middle line:84%
away from the child, it seems
as if one or another has to die.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And from that, we
have this conflict

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.560 align:middle line:84%
where the new version
of the universe

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.010 align:middle line:84%
seems to kill the old
version of the universe.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:45.070 align:middle line:84%
The child trying
to kill the father,

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.920 align:middle line:84%
and the father seeing
that as a threat

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.380 align:middle line:84%
because he is divided
from the child

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.610 align:middle line:90%
and trying to kill the child.

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:90%
So you have this--

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Freud would call it
the Oedipus complex.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very true
kind of complex--

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:05.200 align:middle line:84%
systematic to it, which
higher frequential beings

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:90%
are aware of.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And you also see that
in a lot of religions.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:13.990 align:middle line:84%
You have the same story, for
example, when Shiva and Parvati

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.490 align:middle line:90%
have the child.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Parvati, the mother of the
universe, is having the child,

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and Shiva sees the child
and tries to kill it.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And then puts up
another elephant head

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:34.030 align:middle line:84%
upon Ganesh and through
that, creates Ganesha.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
also, this bad karma

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:40.690 align:middle line:84%
was healed, because Shiva,
the male part of the universe,

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:44.690 align:middle line:84%
understood that Ganesha
is a part of him.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, Ganesha is
the symbol of joy and reunion

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.870 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And the same story
is when we talk

00:17:53.200 --> 00:18:02.440 align:middle line:84%
about Jesus, who is kind of
killed by the father himself,

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:90%
which is the sad part.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Because it misses out
the solution part.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:12.340 align:middle line:84%
It's only Jesus as the
child of the universe

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:16.720 align:middle line:84%
being killed and asking, oh,
man, Father, what have I done?

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.170 align:middle line:84%
So the solution is
in the Vedas, when

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Shiva, as the male
part of the universe,

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:26.480 align:middle line:84%
understood that there
is no separation.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And he is the loving
father of the child.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:33.520 align:middle line:84%
But through that, we have
a interesting dynamic,

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and that is something
being six has

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:39.130 align:middle line:84%
explained as something
that is essentially

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.950 align:middle line:90%
going wrong in this world.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Because as the male part
seems to be divided from love,

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:51.490 align:middle line:84%
from the union and,
thinking that the child, who

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.730 align:middle line:84%
has got all the attention
and energy from the mother,

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:58.780 align:middle line:84%
has also taken away the
mother love from the father,

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:03.250 align:middle line:84%
then the male part
gets into activity

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:09.580 align:middle line:84%
in order to get the attention
back that he, in an illusion,

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.890 align:middle line:90%
seems to have missed.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:15.010 align:middle line:84%
He starts to be
proactive in order

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:19.620 align:middle line:84%
to fight for the
love of the princess,

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know, be
worthy of something.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim how does the Vedic
analogy relate to humans

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:28.270 align:middle line:90%
and level six beings?

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Look, the Greys, for example,
they are pretty hands on with

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:32.350 align:middle line:90%
their solutions.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.750 align:middle line:84%
They say, OK, we
have that and that.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:84%
So we, I don't know, we get in,
and we change some variables.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And then some time
it would work out.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.960 align:middle line:84%
What being six is
saying is that there

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:52.120 align:middle line:84%
is some kind of imbalance,
but it's already

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.710 align:middle line:90%
solved in the moment.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And they would only try to
give you philosophical advice.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.430 align:middle line:84%
If you say something,
OK, you're feeling bad,

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:02.980 align:middle line:84%
but everything is
fine already, then

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:05.900 align:middle line:84%
he would say, like, that
doesn't help me in any way.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.000 align:middle line:84%
But that is the perspective
that being six looks upon.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.560 align:middle line:84%
It's just the same way with,
I don't know, what Jesus said,

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:19.690 align:middle line:84%
what the Veda said, what Buddha
said, what everyone said,

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.530 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
all right already.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:27.550 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't help
in a practical way,

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and people are
looking for solutions,

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and solution-- a hands-on based
solution, instead of just come

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.210 align:middle line:84%
to a point where everything
is all right and everything

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:41.590 align:middle line:90%
is all right.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And the Greys are sort
of the intermediary

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:90%
of those perspectives on life.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>> If humans are a
genetically-modified species,

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.830 align:middle line:84%
who are the genetic mothers
and fathers who created us?

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Depends on how
you look upon it.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:03.150 align:middle line:84%
There are about 12 species
that have put their influences

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and genetics into certain parts
of the population on Earth.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:84%
But if you zoom out very,
very far, it's still source.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that
everyone needs to acknowledge.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's also, if
we're coming back

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.220 align:middle line:84%
to the Veda, that's
also the solution.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Because in the end
there's the story

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:84%
where Ganesh, who was the
elephant child of the universe,

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:33.020 align:middle line:84%
he gains eternal life by
acknowledging that he's always

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:36.710 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by mother
and father, and that

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:39.530 align:middle line:90%
is the ultimate joy of him.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but zooming in, tell
us about the 12 influences

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.120 align:middle line:90%
on humanity.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been said
that it's 12 species.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there are more.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:54.230 align:middle line:84%
I know of the Greys being
one manipulator species.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.620 align:middle line:84%
There are some
reptilian species.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:06.080 align:middle line:84%
There are, allegedly, some very
benevolent and sweet species

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:11.330 align:middle line:84%
that also did that, some
connected to the planet Venus.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.240 align:middle line:84%
But I'm mostly informed
about the Greys.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Was this a collective
influence from the 12 beings,

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:20.400 align:middle line:84%
or did they act
individually on their own?

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>> It was not a
collective effort.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.470 align:middle line:84%
To my understanding,
it's kind of a progress,

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:32.180 align:middle line:84%
because at some
point, humans seem

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:84%
to be more divine and more,
at least spiritually, more

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.390 align:middle line:90%
advanced than people are now.

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, allegedly,
15,000 years ago, people

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:53.090 align:middle line:84%
started to become more unstable,
more open for conflicts,

00:22:53.090 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:84%
more open for conquering
spaces and fighting for things.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was obvious
to some species

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:08.240 align:middle line:90%
that something went wrong.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And it took some time to find
out and to do some research

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:16.250 align:middle line:90%
and analyze what happened.

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:20.150 align:middle line:84%
So the overall code
of the universe

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:28.910 align:middle line:84%
tries to find spots where there
are challenges and paradoxes

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and then zooms into that
spot and tries to solve them.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.070 align:middle line:84%
So duality, for
example, is a paradox.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.730 align:middle line:90%
It needs to be decided.

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Somebody needs to decide
for the universe, which

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:51.840 align:middle line:84%
is all and everything, all at
once, how things will turn out.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Any idea of who
that source being is?

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, you and me and everyone.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is Earth attractive
to all these different ETs

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:90%
and interfrequential beings?

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there are a million
reasons for why Earth could be

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:14.760 align:middle line:84%
attractive to individuals
or even whole species.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Some of the more basic
approaches to that question

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:24.180 align:middle line:84%
is, for example, that there are
things on Earth that are fun.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:29.600 align:middle line:84%
For example, a lot
of non-terrestrials

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:36.360 align:middle line:84%
that acknowledge this, they,
for example, love Disney World.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:40.670 align:middle line:84%
They, at least some,
do like the idea.

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:44.600 align:middle line:84%
I know that some have
visited that and found

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.570 align:middle line:84%
that interesting,
because it's the highest

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:52.850 align:middle line:84%
potential of creativity
and creative energy

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:58.410 align:middle line:84%
that humans could bring
up, and they enjoy that.

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.060 align:middle line:90%
Some do enjoy that.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's for
obvious reasons.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:05.925 align:middle line:90%
I can totally understand why.

00:25:05.925 --> 00:25:10.620 align:middle line:84%
If somebody goes to a different
country and enjoys their food,

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.380 align:middle line:84%
then why shouldn't
other lifeforms

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:17.850 align:middle line:84%
enjoy things that are really,
really great on Earth?

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:23.970 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the more basic
forms of interest in Earth,

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:27.960 align:middle line:90%
and it's not one of the--

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.090 align:middle line:84%
not that everyone
in the universe

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.080 align:middle line:90%
just comes for Disney World.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:37.590 align:middle line:84%
But the more sophisticated
approach to that question

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:43.830 align:middle line:84%
would be that the potential of
evolution of humans on Earth

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:47.640 align:middle line:84%
is pretty high because they
have all the stress and all

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.960 align:middle line:90%
this chaos.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.380 align:middle line:84%
So that means they make
a lot of experience.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.110 align:middle line:84%
They have to find
a lot of solution,

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and the more solution
and experience you have,

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:02.850 align:middle line:84%
the quicker you evolve
compared to a species that,

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:05.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, grabs
a hole in the sand

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.920 align:middle line:84%
and just plays time
for very, very long.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.130 align:middle line:84%
They do not tend to
evolve that quickly.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And Earth people, with all that
stress and all the challenges,

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.330 align:middle line:90%
they have to evolve quickly.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a 3D reality, other
than this materialistic world

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:23.850 align:middle line:90%
that we live in?

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing that I know from
the Greys is that there is

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:33.340 align:middle line:84%
a different reality, where
one life form of species lives

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:39.580 align:middle line:84%
in that is kind of specialized
in building holographic

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.170 align:middle line:90%
realities.

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Those are pretty
small beings that

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:54.750 align:middle line:84%
are kind of crafting those
holographic realities, where

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:58.710 align:middle line:90%
souls can have experiences in.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:84%
That is their approach to
the probabilities and wealth

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:09.390 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, which is
totally exotic and totally

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:12.940 align:middle line:90%
different to what we have here.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:20.640 align:middle line:84%
It's more like reality,
where they are using tools

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.050 align:middle line:84%
to craft pieces of
reality together

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:29.520 align:middle line:84%
in order to create
scenarios where a life

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.700 align:middle line:90%
form can experience something.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's totally
awkward and totally

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.680 align:middle line:90%
different to what we perceive.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Does that exist in
another space on Earth,

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:44.590 align:middle line:84%
or are they somewhere
else altogether?

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I cannot explain, and I
cannot imagine the way this

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:55.460 align:middle line:84%
reality is connected to this
reality we experience here.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:28:01.960 align:middle line:84%
So I have no model
how that and this

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.900 align:middle line:84%
is, in some way or
another, connected.

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:10.600 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be just a totally
exotic and different reality,

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.260 align:middle line:84%
where things are
a lot more shiny,

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:18.920 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different
colors, different fields,

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:28.530 align:middle line:84%
different vibrations, and it's
just some different world.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if one can take
things from there into here.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we'll find out, but I
know the Greys are there, too.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you say about the
idea that we could be living

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:43.870 align:middle line:90%
in a holographic universe?

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say we live in a
creative, observer-centered,

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:55.350 align:middle line:84%
mental-based reality that can
be everything that you put

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:58.080 align:middle line:90%
your dedication upon.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:06.270 align:middle line:84%
It's more in creative aspects to
probabilities and possibilities

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:13.650 align:middle line:84%
inside of an empty but
intelligent void that exists.

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, what's your takeaway
for the viewers when we look

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.500 align:middle line:84%
at different worlds and
different world views within

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.910 align:middle line:90%
the universe?

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd say we're all hovering,
but there's no ground.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.100 align:middle line:90%
That's my take on the universe.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I think we have almost
infinite potential

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:37.020 align:middle line:84%
of being creative and
experiencing things

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and it's, in reality,
far less dramatic

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.940 align:middle line:84%
than it appears to
be in this reality.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And once we open
ourselves for that

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:53.340 align:middle line:84%
and become aware of
our position in life

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:57.180 align:middle line:84%
and that we are responsible
and that we are experiencing

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:01.770 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, and we finally have
the opportunity to open up

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and to have conversations,
communications, and feelings,

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:12.060 align:middle line:84%
then life becomes a
lot more pleasant.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.150 align:middle line:84%
