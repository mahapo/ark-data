00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are talking about recent

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.690 align:middle line:10%
missions with Randy Cramer.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:10%
Randy, welcome.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.440 align:middle line:10%
Well, on previous
episodes, Randy,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.540 align:middle line:10%
we talked about the Nautilus.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to find
out-- a lot of viewers

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.460 align:middle line:84%
have been writing in and wanted
to get more details on this.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.260 align:middle line:84%
The Nautilus is classified
as an IG highliner craft.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And the IG, in this case,
stands for Intergalactic.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Most vehicles having either
an IG or an IS designation

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:84%
to indicate whether they're
an intergalactically capable

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.240 align:middle line:84%
traveling vehicle or whether
their intersolar, and only

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.130 align:middle line:84%
for cruising around
the solar system.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:84%
It's classified as
an IG highliner.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.320 align:middle line:84%
It's about a mile
or so in length.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.680 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like a
cylinder, like a long tube.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.735 align:middle line:84%
The front section is
the command section.

00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:08.210 align:middle line:84%
The rear section is the
engineering section.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.220 align:middle line:84%
The middle section
is the flight deck.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.300 align:middle line:84%
So as a pilot, I lived and
worked on the flight deck.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:90%
And then when we--

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.920 align:middle line:84%
basically, 99% of what
we did was patrols.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.330 align:middle line:84%
So the Nautilus
itself would deploy

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.410 align:middle line:84%
to a location in the
solar system somewhere,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.860 align:middle line:84%
and then we would get
deployed out in squadrons,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and go do these kind of a search
pattern over a large area,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.220 align:middle line:90%
and then come back.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.350 align:middle line:90%
And do that several times a day.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.480 align:middle line:84%
I used to call it
glorified guard dog

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.910 align:middle line:84%
duty, because anything that
comes in the yard that's not

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be in the
yard, we'd bark-- bar, bar,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.793 align:middle line:90%
bar-- and chase them away.

00:01:46.793 --> 00:01:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically
what we did.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So if we ever ran
into anything that

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.985 align:middle line:84%
was outside the shipping
lanes, because all traffic goes

00:01:52.985 --> 00:01:54.110 align:middle line:90%
through the shipping lanes.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And so we would be patrolling
outside the shipping

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.860 align:middle line:84%
lanes for ne'er do wells trying
to sneak in past the defenses.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I would assume that
there's many different teams

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.670 align:middle line:84%
on here for different
missions, or is it really just

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.380 align:middle line:90%
for security forces?

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Or do you have like an
environmental group in there?

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Do you have these other--

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.820 align:middle line:84%
do you have a medical group
in there on these missions?

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The Nautilus itself is
basically a flying aircraft

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:90%
carrier.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.860 align:middle line:84%
So there is certainly
a medical section.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a medical team
if somebody gets hurt,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:90%
or we find anything interesting.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.750 align:middle line:90%
But usually, that's not our job.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.200 align:middle line:90%
Usually, we blow something up.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.658 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you
know, someone else

00:02:32.658 --> 00:02:35.240 align:middle line:84%
comes along and cleans up the
debris and picks up the parts.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.975 align:middle line:84%
>> How long are these missions
when you go onto the craft?

00:02:39.975 --> 00:02:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, a patrol can
be a couple of hours.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the longest
patrol I think I was on

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:84%
was maybe almost
four hours long.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:84%
But patrols are usually pretty
quick in the sense that you--

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.340 align:middle line:84%
again, you're running
a search pattern.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're
done, you come back.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.142 align:middle line:84%
And then the ship moves,
and you do another one.

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And you just keep running
these search patterns

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.960 align:middle line:90%
until your shift's over.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the
gravity on these craft?

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.005 align:middle line:84%
And do you also have
other smaller craft that

00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:07.260 align:middle line:90%
are attached to this craft?

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, sure.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.100 align:middle line:84%
So gravity plating,
which is essentially--

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.600 align:middle line:84%
my understanding of the gravity
plating is they're about a 4

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.820 align:middle line:90%
by 4 plate.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And they have these
magnetogravitic coils in them

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.410 align:middle line:84%
that's essentially
able to create a pull,

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.460 align:middle line:84%
a gravity pull
that's adjustable.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So you can adjust them
to 0.1, 0.5, 1 G, 2

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.930 align:middle line:84%
G. You can adjust them to
whatever for your needs.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.210 align:middle line:90%
So they're adjustable to--

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:90%
well, we sell them.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.428 align:middle line:84%
For instance, so if a species
wanted gravity plating

00:03:39.428 --> 00:03:40.970 align:middle line:84%
for their ships,
they could adjust it

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.580 align:middle line:84%
to whatever the gravitation
of their homeworld is.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So it helps us not
lose muscle mass,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.260 align:middle line:84%
but it turns out there
is also something

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.190 align:middle line:84%
in the human body that
requires literal grounding.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.540 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of that floating
around changes the DNA.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not very healthy
for even astronauts

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.053 align:middle line:84%
that we have like working
on the International Space

00:04:05.053 --> 00:04:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Station and the shuttle
missions and so forth.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.262 align:middle line:90%
It's not very healthy for them.

00:04:08.262 --> 00:04:10.790 align:middle line:84%
So that gravity plating
helps keep you grounded

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and reduces the incidents
of space madness, which

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.020 align:middle line:90%
is a real thing, and it sucks.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Are we looking at thousands
of craft and hundreds

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.959 align:middle line:90%
of thousands of soldiers?

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>> There were multiple
highliners and multiple

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.710 align:middle line:90%
carriers.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I think there was at
least a dozen of them

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.000 align:middle line:90%
and several hundred fighters.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And do you actually go to
these planets with these craft?

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when I was on
the Nautilus, not so much.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.390 align:middle line:84%
The Nautilus was pretty
much an intersolar activity.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.120 align:middle line:84%
We patrolled around
the solar system.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.920 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I was on the
Farragut, that was different.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.877 align:middle line:84%
The Farragut is about half the
length, a little bit wider.

00:04:46.877 --> 00:04:47.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a little bit flatter.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a special forces frigate.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So it has 18 different
special forces teams,

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.330 align:middle line:84%
which all have really
different designations.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.328 align:middle line:84%
So I like to think of it as the
Swiss army knife of the fleet.

00:04:59.328 --> 00:05:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So depending on what you
need, depending on which

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.440 align:middle line:84%
tool you flip out of
your Swiss army knife.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And that vehicle
and those forces

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.508 align:middle line:84%
were deployed across
the galaxy and farther.

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you share with us some
of those functions and devices?

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's 18 different
special forces teams.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So each team is
specially designated,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.000 align:middle line:84%
has a specific training,
specific background,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.070 align:middle line:90%
is good at certain things.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.080 align:middle line:84%
The team that I worked
with, our primary function

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.650 align:middle line:84%
was rapid insertion and
extraction or termination

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.120 align:middle line:90%
of high value targets.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.440 align:middle line:90%
So that was what we did.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.430 align:middle line:84%
We flew these very,
very fast craft

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:84%
that go in and out of a
situation very, very quickly,

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.643 align:middle line:84%
and either grab someone that
you want to save or kill someone

00:05:44.643 --> 00:05:45.810 align:middle line:90%
that you want to get rid of.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.102 align:middle line:90%
So that was mostly what we did.

00:05:47.102 --> 00:05:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And then get out again
really, really fast.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you share with me what
are the devices and weapons

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.420 align:middle line:84%
you're using to
acquire these beings?

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.477 align:middle line:84%
>> So we had an exosuit, which
we had an exosuit when I was

00:05:59.477 --> 00:06:01.310 align:middle line:84%
in the MDF, which is
the Mars Defense Force,

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.870 align:middle line:84%
which I've talked
a little bit about.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.310 align:middle line:10%
These were way
more sophisticated.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.050 align:middle line:84%
So there were three
primary types of exosuits.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.820 align:middle line:90%
There was what we call the--

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.260 align:middle line:84%
we sort of called the baby
exosuit, because it's small,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's tight to the body and
has small hydraulics and stuff

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:19.490 align:middle line:90%
in it.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
It gives you about a 25%
increase in strength,

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:90%
endurance, and speed.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.770 align:middle line:84%
But that's in a body armored
suit and an environment suit

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:84%
that then you step into what
we used to call the papa bear

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.570 align:middle line:84%
exosuit, which is a larger
exosuit, which has larger

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.045 align:middle line:90%
hydraulics, larger mechanisms.

00:06:41.045 --> 00:06:45.050 align:middle line:84%
It also has a mounted
rail gun on the right arm.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.070 align:middle line:84%
It has a mounted
programmable rocket launcher

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.410 align:middle line:90%
on the left arm.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.220 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, it has a
shoulder-mounted rocket

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:00.030 align:middle line:84%
launcher, or depending on
the need for the mission,

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.355 align:middle line:84%
the rear launching weapon
can be outfitted differently.

00:07:04.355 --> 00:07:08.588 align:middle line:84%
So you can have a rocket
launcher or a plasma launcher,

00:07:08.588 --> 00:07:10.130 align:middle line:84%
or you can have
something that shoots

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:84%
behind you in case someone's
trying to sneak up,

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.080 align:middle line:90%
or you have--

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.240 align:middle line:84%
basically you can
hit things behind you

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.020 align:middle line:90%
without having to see them.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a pretty peculiar thing.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:84%
So you've got this
heads-up display.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.000 align:middle line:84%
You've got this little
screen down here,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.700 align:middle line:84%
which is basically we
call the rear view mirror,

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.660 align:middle line:84%
because it shows you
exactly what's behind you.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's got a little
targeting reticle.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And so if all of a sudden
I see something light up

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.310 align:middle line:84%
in the infrared on
that back screen,

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.150 align:middle line:84%
then that gives me an option
to target and launch basically

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.545 align:middle line:90%
with a verbal command.

00:07:39.545 --> 00:07:42.680 align:middle line:84%
It has a hydraulic
augmented leg so

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.300 align:middle line:90%
that you can jump really far.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a control
panel on the wrist.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.790 align:middle line:90%
You can program the jumper.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:53.270 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually see
where you are on a map.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And you can program I want to
jump from here to here to here,

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.490 align:middle line:84%
and then the computer
will calculate

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.250 align:middle line:84%
based on the gravity and
the weight exactly how

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.580 align:middle line:84%
much force the legs
need to jump to land you

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.570 align:middle line:90%
in the exact same spot.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.420 align:middle line:84%
So instead of-- you have the
ability to jump manually,

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.360 align:middle line:84%
but you also have this ability
to get ridiculous precision

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.182 align:middle line:84%
by programming what
jumps you want to do.

00:08:13.182 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And so you can go 1, 2,
3, something like that.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the rocket
launcher, you can also

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.550 align:middle line:84%
program whether you want it to
explode in front of a target,

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.320 align:middle line:84%
to the side of a target,
or behind the target.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.080 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of armor
is frontloaded,

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.659 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of-- some of
it's not always backloaded.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.309 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes really
all you want to do

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:84%
is position an exploding
projectile behind someone's

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:84%
head a couple of feet
instead of in front of them,

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.065 align:middle line:84%
because behind them
you'll do more damage.

00:08:43.065 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>> You're explaining to me
something that just reminds me

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.650 align:middle line:84%
of all out, complete war,
which means there's definitely

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:84%
an agenda behind that, that
you were involved with.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And what was that
agenda for that race?

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.903 align:middle line:90%
>> Primarily contracting.

00:08:57.903 --> 00:08:59.570 align:middle line:84%
So we have all these
trade relationships

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.550 align:middle line:84%
with all of these
other species, right?

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And very much in
the same way here

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.742 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth, the United
States military, biggest,

00:09:07.742 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:84%
strongest military
in the world, we

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.330 align:middle line:84%
have many allies
and trade partners

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.500 align:middle line:84%
around the world who don't have
really sophisticated militaries

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and really amazing
training programs.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes when they need
something done, they call us.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.647 align:middle line:84%
And then we work out a
deal on whether we're

00:09:22.647 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle line:84%
going to help them,
or what it's going

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.042 align:middle line:84%
to cost for us to
come help them,

00:09:26.042 --> 00:09:28.250 align:middle line:84%
what the trade agreement
would need to be, et cetera.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's no different out in
the intergalactic community.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.250 align:middle line:90%
We have many trade partners.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them are not as
military equipped as we are.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So when they need
military assistance

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.790 align:middle line:84%
or they find themselves
in a conflict, well,

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.540 align:middle line:84%
who do you think
they call first?

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:45.360 align:middle line:90%
They call us.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.160 align:middle line:90%
So then--

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>> What brings on
these conflicts?

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.320 align:middle line:84%
What did they do to us that
we have to attack them?

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, again, it's not usually
something that they're doing

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:90%
directly to us.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.840 align:middle line:84%
More often than not,
it's a trade route threat

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.670 align:middle line:90%
or a trade partner threat.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want our
trade routes threatened,

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and we don't want our
trade partners threatened.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.525 align:middle line:84%
>> A type of
protection services.

00:10:06.525 --> 00:10:07.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:07.325 --> 00:10:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So if we have a
trade partner that

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.720 align:middle line:84%
gets invaded by a
neighbor, or maybe has

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.140 align:middle line:84%
a couple of planetary
colonies that get invaded

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.540 align:middle line:84%
by a local neighbor, and
they're like, ah, what do we do?

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.582 align:middle line:90%
They're going to call us.

00:10:18.582 --> 00:10:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Space pirates.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Or space pirates,
which is a thing.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Space pirates are a thing.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I mean, they
call us, and we show up

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:90%
with the best of the best.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Randy, what mission was the
most mind-blowing mission that

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.570 align:middle line:90%
you've ever had?

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I can think of maybe two
or three things that might fit

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:90%
that criteria.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:90%
So I'll pick one.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:46.360 align:middle line:84%
We were contracted
by a trade partner

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:84%
to help liberate a colony
that had been attacked.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And they called us
in to go and liberate

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:54.830 align:middle line:90%
some high value targets.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you tell us their
names or what system?

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:03.070 align:middle line:84%
They're a species that lives
in the Cassiopeian system.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.400 align:middle line:84%
They were having an issue
with a hostile neighbor that

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:12.610 align:middle line:84%
had sort of tried to seize
a couple of their colonies.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And so they called
us and asked us

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.630 align:middle line:84%
to bring in some
material support

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and see if we could liberate
some high value targets

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and maybe brush some
of the enemy aside.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:28.390 align:middle line:84%
So we approached this planet,
scanning for bases, colonies,

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.260 align:middle line:90%
lifeforms.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.550 align:middle line:84%
None of the species
that we were looking for

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.620 align:middle line:90%
showed up on our scopes at all.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Only normal vegetative and
animal life was showing.

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:40.150 align:middle line:90%
So that--

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you also scan the
inside the planet as well?

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our scanners
go about 40 miles down.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.315 align:middle line:84%
About 40 miles,
which is pretty good.

00:11:49.315 --> 00:11:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>> As a stealth mission, you're
cloaked coming into this?

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:53.350 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.730 align:middle line:90%
Well, let me put it this way.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Our ship is still about halfway
across the solar system.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.302 align:middle line:84%
We send a couple of drones
in to take pictures and scans

00:12:02.302 --> 00:12:03.510 align:middle line:90%
and get really, really close.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And they're cloaked
and everything.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And we were just seeing
these empty structures

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.900 align:middle line:84%
and empty buildings,
and weren't sure

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.940 align:middle line:84%
whether they were
hiding somewhere,

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.950 align:middle line:84%
whether they'd
already evacuated,

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.095 align:middle line:84%
or whether they'd
all been massacred.

00:12:17.095 --> 00:12:18.770 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't tell from
where we were at.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So when we went down onto
the surface of the planet

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.500 align:middle line:84%
to investigate,
we were surprised.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:32.530 align:middle line:84%
So there was another
extraterrestrial spe--

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to use the
term "species" loosely,

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.780 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
believe that this

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.390 align:middle line:90%
was an organic-evolved species.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:44.230 align:middle line:84%
We think this was a
genetically-engineered species

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.590 align:middle line:84%
that was a planet killer,
that was basically,

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:90%
you throw one of these--

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Who made them?

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>> We don't know.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.910 align:middle line:90%
We're not sure.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.190 align:middle line:84%
We haven't been able to
track down who made them.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:58.000 align:middle line:84%
We think the species that
was engaged in hostilities

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.500 align:middle line:84%
was being sold weapons tech
by another species, two

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.930 align:middle line:84%
or three other arms
merchants from somewhere.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So somebody came along and
gave them this alien weapon,

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:16.210 align:middle line:84%
which basically creates this
genetically-- biological

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:20.575 align:middle line:84%
killing machine that looks--
it can be out of phase,

00:13:20.575 --> 00:13:22.210 align:middle line:90%
so you can't see it on infrared.

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:23.740 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it in ultraviolet.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.930 align:middle line:84%
You can't pick it up on
the scopes of the scanners.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:30.940 align:middle line:84%
It has the ability to
teleport short distances.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.210 align:middle line:84%
They're psionically
telepathically linked.

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:38.017 align:middle line:84%
So when you run into one, it's
going to tell the others nearby

00:13:38.017 --> 00:13:39.100 align:middle line:90%
that they need to show up.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.887 align:middle line:84%
And before you know it,
you're going to be in a swarm.

00:13:41.887 --> 00:13:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>> What do they look like?

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god.

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:44.750 align:middle line:90%
They're horrifying.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So imagine a scorpion
with arms and a stinger

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.605 align:middle line:84%
with a piercing stinger on
it that's about a foot long.

00:13:54.605 --> 00:13:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:01.550 align:middle line:10%
>> A head with no eyes, lots
of teeth, and a couple legs,

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:05.200 align:middle line:10%
and a couple of arms
to grab things with.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And they scurry, and they
stab with the stinger.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And again, they show
up in massive swarms.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:14.230 align:middle line:10%
And there's just-- you just run.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.580 align:middle line:10%
>> How large are these?

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.557 align:middle line:84%
>> Big as a motorcycle
with a sidecar.

00:14:18.557 --> 00:14:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>> What do they eat?

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Where do they live
there on the planet?

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>> We have no idea.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.075 align:middle line:90%
They come out of nowhere.

00:14:24.075 --> 00:14:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know
where they live.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:26.860 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how they habitat.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.450 align:middle line:90%
They eat anything, apparently.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.300 align:middle line:84%
With those teeth, they
absolutely eat anything.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So how did this mission
resolve itself since they were

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.160 align:middle line:90%
so vicious and terrifying?

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>> We had to evacuate the
planet, and then, well,

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:46.690 align:middle line:84%
we discussed with the species
who called us in and with

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:47.800 align:middle line:90%
our command personnel.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And the commanders decided
to use a metagenic weapon.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So they annihilated
all life on the planet.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>> What is a metagenic weapon?

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>> A metagenic weapon is
like a bacteria or a virus

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:03.310 align:middle line:84%
that's so strong that it will
wipe out all life on a planet

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:90%
usually within a few days.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So they couldn't just make
it just for that species,

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't have
probably any knowledge

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:10.960 align:middle line:90%
of the DNA.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>> We couldn't capture one.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.300 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't capture one.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>> That says lot.

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.635 align:middle line:84%
>> You guys couldn't
capture one.

00:15:18.635 --> 00:15:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>> No, we couldn't capture one.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever had that
experience before with another

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.530 align:middle line:84%
species you were
trying to acquire?

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Nope, nope.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.197 align:middle line:90%
That we couldn't get--

00:15:25.197 --> 00:15:27.040 align:middle line:84%
that we couldn't cut
off an arm or a leg?

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:27.520 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.103 align:middle line:84%
>> What was your
role in that mission?

00:15:29.103 --> 00:15:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Did you go to the
surface or were you

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.183 align:middle line:84%
still outside the
exoatmosphere, looking in?

00:15:34.183 --> 00:15:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I was on the surface.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.440 align:middle line:84%
My job was to lead a team
into the headquarters

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.110 align:middle line:84%
of the military
base that was empty

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and see if we could find
any traces of anyone,

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:47.087 align:middle line:84%
any bodies, any recorded or
written messages, anything

00:15:47.087 --> 00:15:49.420 align:middle line:84%
to let us know what happened
to them or where they went.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they have debriefing
files that you could go through

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.770 align:middle line:84%
to prepare yourself for
this horrific event?

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>> We knew very little.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.860 align:middle line:84%
The species that
we were helping,

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.350 align:middle line:84%
this Cassiopeian
species, had given us

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.250 align:middle line:84%
the basic intel
information of who

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.340 align:middle line:84%
was there, where
the colonies were,

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.690 align:middle line:90%
where the military bases were.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:09.530 align:middle line:84%
They gave us that
basic information.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.390 align:middle line:84%
But when we got there,
nobody was there.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:90%
All the life signs were gone.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:18.220 align:middle line:84%
So we had intel that when
we got there changed,

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:84%
and so we had to essentially
just go from square one

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.050 align:middle line:84%
to try and figure out what
was going on and what to do.

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you lose anyone in
your team on this mission?

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Two.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And how many were actually with
you down there on the surface?

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>> 12.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And did they die
from these creatures?

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Ripped to shreds.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Were your weapons
not working on them?

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, they were working.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:40.770 align:middle line:90%
We were just overwhelmed.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>> There were just too many.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.792 align:middle line:90%
>> There were too many of them.

00:16:42.792 --> 00:16:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Literally, it was,
"There's too many of them!

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.790 align:middle line:90%
Get us out here!"

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.123 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was-- yeah, there
were just too many of them,

00:16:48.123 --> 00:16:49.730 align:middle line:90%
because they teleport in.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So if you got one, 20
more will teleport in

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.500 align:middle line:90%
within a few minutes.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.958 align:middle line:84%
Within a few minutes after
that, another 50, or another 100

00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:56.758 align:middle line:90%
will teleport in.

00:16:56.758 --> 00:16:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And you'd be swarmed
in a matter of minutes.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you able to get any
samples from the remains

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.250 align:middle line:90%
to take back with you?

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:04.869 align:middle line:90%
>> Nope.

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:06.769 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that planet
still habitable?

00:17:06.769 --> 00:17:07.569 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.660 align:middle line:90%
Everything's dead-- lifeless.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it could be
reterraformed, maybe.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.650 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, there's still
a breathable atmosphere,

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:18.550 align:middle line:84%
but every plant,
animal, insect is dead.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Have you heard that these--

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:24.839 align:middle line:84%
this species survived anywhere
else on any other planets?

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Or was that the last time
you've ever seen them?

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's the first and
last time I've ever seen them.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.610 align:middle line:84%
I have spoken to at
least one other person

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.010 align:middle line:84%
who also ran into them
in a separate mission

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:37.020 align:middle line:90%
somewhere else.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, but what we think we
understand about them is iffy,

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:84%
but they don't seem like they're
a sentient, technologically

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.880 align:middle line:90%
advanced, spacefaring species.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.020 align:middle line:84%
They're a genetically
engineered foot soldier.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.480 align:middle line:84%
So while they're
psionically connected

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and have some
advanced evolution,

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.320 align:middle line:84%
we never got the sense
from them that there

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.050 align:middle line:84%
was what you or I would
normally think of as

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:90%
intelligent, coherent thought.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:07.840 align:middle line:84%
It was more like animals
who were programmed

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.450 align:middle line:90%
to be way better than animals.

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.060 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think that
that species in itself

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.380 align:middle line:90%
is the threat.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:18.220 align:middle line:90%
Whoever made them might be.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.960 align:middle line:84%
But that species in
question is a weapon.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a weaponized, organic,
engineered scorpion thing.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Was it a hypothesis that you
and your team came up with that

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:90%
they have this psionic ability?

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Or is it more like just ants
when you disturb the pile,

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle line:84%
they let a scent out and
everyone knows what to do.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>> We had psionic specialists
who were viewing the whole

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:41.530 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And their report was
that these were creatures

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.930 align:middle line:84%
that had a psionic ability,
that they would communicate

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:84%
with others, and that that
would draw others in at a range.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>> What was the longest length
that you've seen one of these

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:58.810 align:middle line:84%
teletransport away from
you or towards you?

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they were
coming from miles away.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.947 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what the psionic
specialists' reports said,

00:19:04.947 --> 00:19:06.530 align:middle line:84%
that they were coming
from miles away.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.240 align:middle line:84%
But there did seem
to be a range.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Their psionic
communication range

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.670 align:middle line:90%
seemed to be about 20 miles.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And their teleportation range
seemed to be about 10 miles.

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the role your
ship up there, Randy?

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:21.550 align:middle line:84%
I know they're monitoring
things, but how does that work?

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean, are they going to--

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.075 align:middle line:84%
are you still in complete
communication with them?

00:19:26.075 --> 00:19:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, yeah, we're in
constant communication.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.470 align:middle line:84%
There's always a
commanding officer

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:33.280 align:middle line:84%
in the earpiece telling you
what's coming up or what to do.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.410 align:middle line:84%
The job of the
ship is essentially

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:37.030 align:middle line:90%
logistics and support.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:39.100 align:middle line:84%
So they're providing
us with a lot

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:44.440 align:middle line:84%
of eyes in the sky, information
telling us where things are,

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and what's around us, what's
happening, who's coming here.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you've got something coming
in on your left flank a mile

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.360 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Get ready for that.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Was your craft on the planet
or were you teletransported

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:56.090 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>> In this particular case,
we were sent down by wormhole,

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.360 align:middle line:84%
because when we determined
that there was no life

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.200 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, or no life that
we could determine that was

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.970 align:middle line:84%
sentient beings, someone
determined in the command

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:12.460 align:middle line:84%
structure that it seemed
risky to take ships down.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to take the
other risk of taking a wormhole

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:17.560 align:middle line:90%
or jumpgate.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.242 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm assuming
your craft is armed.

00:20:19.242 --> 00:20:20.200 align:middle line:90%
Is it armed, the craft?

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Can they provide support
like we do here in the military?

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Can they come down there?

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Can they start shooting
things from way

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.420 align:middle line:84%
up there to extract
you know safely?

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Just like down here, you
don't start artillery bombing

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:38.890 align:middle line:84%
an enemy that's
engaging in close up

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:41.770 align:middle line:84%
hand-to-hand with
your own troops,

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:43.390 align:middle line:84%
because you're
going to bomb them.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So there really wasn't
an opportunity for them

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:49.360 align:middle line:84%
to provide air support, or
any kind of sky support.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.710 align:middle line:84%
So they were in communication
and watching the situation

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.360 align:middle line:90%
as it unfolded.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Any situation that we
engage in militarily,

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.950 align:middle line:84%
our first reaction
is not to run away.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Our first response is to engage
and attain victory, and then

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:05.800 align:middle line:90%
decide what to do after that.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle line:84%
As the situation began
to devolve, and get worse

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.870 align:middle line:84%
and worse and worse,
and it was clear

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.797 align:middle line:84%
that we were not going
to be able to win,

00:21:12.797 --> 00:21:15.130 align:middle line:84%
and it was a matter of how
then are we going to get out,

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:16.562 align:middle line:84%
then the discussion
was like, OK,

00:21:16.562 --> 00:21:17.770 align:middle line:90%
what do we do for extraction?

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:19.390 align:middle line:84%
How do we get you
guys out of here?

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.340 align:middle line:90%
It was a pretty short conflict.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.480 align:middle line:90%
It didn't last very long--

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.850 align:middle line:90%
15-20 minutes tops.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.830 align:middle line:90%
But it went to shit really fast.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a long
time during that.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So they essentially
extracted us via jumpgate,

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.680 align:middle line:90%
and we all popped through.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And one of the uglies managed
to come through behind us

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.630 align:middle line:90%
through the wormhole, but was--

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Severed.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>> That was just one.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.120 align:middle line:90%
No, we killed it instantly.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.280 align:middle line:84%
I think it came through, and
it was like 10 against one.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.460 align:middle line:90%
And at that point, it was--

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>> But then something triggered
in its biological mechanism,

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and all of these
cells, apparently,

00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:00.040 align:middle line:84%
when they started to gas out
started to secrete a highly,

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:90%
highly caustic base.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Not an acid, but a base.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the DNA
and the biology

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.720 align:middle line:90%
liquefied in about 5 minutes.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.260 align:middle line:84%
That makes me definitely
believe it was bioengineered.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.810 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
reasons why we think so.

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Because if you see that,
that's a safety protocol we put

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:22.710 align:middle line:84%
in beings that we're making so
no one else can recopy what we

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:23.510 align:middle line:90%
just made.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:25.145 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like
securing our patent.

00:22:25.145 --> 00:22:25.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:25.945 --> 00:22:28.400 align:middle line:84%
There's no way to get a copy
of the DNA and make a copy.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.020 align:middle line:90%
It's dissolved.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:29.670 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:29.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, fascinating.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Randy, after one
of these missions,

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.000 align:middle line:84%
what's the protocol
once you get back from--

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.850 align:middle line:90%
you just was on a planet.

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:43.060 align:middle line:90%
You had engaged some species.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.570 align:middle line:90%
Do you go into decontamination?

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:84%
We go into decon quarantine
when you come back

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.930 align:middle line:90%
from a place like that.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And every square inch of
every piece of equipment,

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.850 align:middle line:84%
every square inch of
your skin is examined.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:84%
You're given blood test after
blood test after endocrine test

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.440 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
you haven't picked up

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.890 align:middle line:84%
any biological
bacteria organisms.

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And then once you've
gone through that,

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:13.053 align:middle line:84%
they still put you in
a tube, in like a pod,

00:23:13.053 --> 00:23:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and you have to lay in that
thing for a couple hours

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.378 align:middle line:84%
while it cleanses out and
kills everything that's

00:23:17.378 --> 00:23:18.420 align:middle line:90%
not supposed to be there.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.585 align:middle line:84%
So it's a pretty intense
quarantine process.

00:23:20.585 --> 00:23:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>> We used to call
them plasma showers.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:28.990 align:middle line:84%
This is more of a bath,
because you sort of lay in it.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, when you're done with
this two decades of this tour

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and you come back, is there
anything special you have to do

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:36.850 align:middle line:90%
to your body?

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Or are you debriefed
on anything else?

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Do you know when you're
going to go out again?

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.433 align:middle line:90%
They don't really tell you much.

00:23:43.433 --> 00:23:45.700 align:middle line:84%
They basically tell you when
you're being rotated out.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And in our case,
we were sent back

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:51.520 align:middle line:84%
to Luna Operations Command
for what they call a "memory

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.020 align:middle line:90%
wipe" and "age reversing."

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm making the air quotes,
because it's not really

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.110 align:middle line:90%
a memory wipe.

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's not really
age reversing.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a memory suppression, and
they don't age reverse the body

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:03.100 align:middle line:90%
that you're in.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:84%
They make a new body,
transfer your consciousness

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.590 align:middle line:84%
to that body, and then
throw your old one

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:09.760 align:middle line:90%
in the incinerator.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you explain that you
have this total recall of these

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.990 align:middle line:90%
memories?

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a lot of
work, first of all.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.570 align:middle line:84%
The memory retrieval
process was something

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.630 align:middle line:84%
that started to happen when
I was younger on its own,

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.340 align:middle line:90%
which it typically does.

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:30.640 align:middle line:84%
But an individual has to
either engage with that

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.750 align:middle line:90%
or disengage with that.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people choose
to disengage with it,

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.790 align:middle line:84%
because they don't necessarily
want to go down that road.

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:40.000 align:middle line:84%
People who do choose to
engage with it end up

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.850 align:middle line:84%
with a long period of time
to sort out the memory recall

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:47.830 align:middle line:90%
process, the trauma process.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.710 align:middle line:90%


00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Every person's experience
is very different.

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:55.360 align:middle line:90%
So it's a complicated process.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And what I have
found is over time

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.750 align:middle line:84%
there is even more than
I thought that there was.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So at first, I thought,
OK, there's this much.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:05.920 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, no, wait.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.130 align:middle line:90%
There's this much.

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, recently, it's,
oh, no, there's this much.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:14.560 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know whether I'm
at the bottom yet of how many

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.070 align:middle line:84%
years or decades
that I spent serving

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.930 align:middle line:84%
in my tour, or
every last memory.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:24.190 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I've got a lot.

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.200 align:middle line:84%
But I guess the short
answer to that question

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:30.580 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of hard work, as
well as the programming

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:31.390 align:middle line:90%
and conditioning.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.870 align:middle line:84%
As I point out sometimes, I am
not programmed and conditioned

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:37.753 align:middle line:84%
like a lot of other people
from a lot of other programs.

00:25:37.753 --> 00:25:39.670 align:middle line:84%
The United States Marine
Corps Special Section

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:84%
had a very different idea about
how we want to train and create

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:45.880 align:middle line:90%
soldiers, augmented soldiers.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:50.380 align:middle line:84%
We don't believe that breaking
someone's mind again and again

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:54.190 align:middle line:84%
and again in order to build
something that's pliable

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:56.260 align:middle line:84%
is a good use of
material, nor is it

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.560 align:middle line:90%
an economical use of material.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Could it could it
actually kill somebody,

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.060 align:middle line:90%
the overload of that?

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I've heard many
things talking in the projects,

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:11.170 align:middle line:84%
where if you get your mind
swiped too many times,

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:12.100 align:middle line:90%
there's no returning.

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.767 align:middle line:84%
You kind of get gorked
out a little bit.

00:26:13.767 --> 00:26:15.130 align:middle line:90%
You can't fit into society.

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:17.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you seem to be
so emotionally stable,

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and you're still receiving
more of this information.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm very fortunate in that way.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, we do
things a bit differently.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So we don't necessarily go with
the trauma-based mind control.

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:32.240 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to break people
in order to rebuild them.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So I think, for starters,
that's my number one probably

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.830 align:middle line:84%
best benefit that
I have in that area

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:41.910 align:middle line:84%
is that I don't have as much
baggage as some other people

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:42.710 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.793 align:middle line:84%
That's not to say that I
wasn't without my baggage

00:26:44.793 --> 00:26:47.510 align:middle line:90%
when I came back from my tour.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:51.770 align:middle line:84%
But decades of working on
a personal healing process

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:57.380 align:middle line:84%
and dedicated meditative work
and dedicated self-mastery

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:01.800 align:middle line:84%
is why I can function out of
doors and in crowds and things

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.600 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I went through years
of terrible agoraphobia

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.880 align:middle line:90%
where I didn't like crowds.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:08.810 align:middle line:90%
I didn't like--

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:12.045 align:middle line:84%
I felt unsafe outdoors,
where something

00:27:12.045 --> 00:27:13.920 align:middle line:84%
could be in the trees,
or anything like that.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was horribly paranoid
to have to live with that.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:20.030 align:middle line:84%
But the healing process,
as it continued,

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:22.850 align:middle line:84%
the symptomology became
less and less and less.

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And the insomnia
started to subside.

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And the anxiety
started to subside.

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:28.940 align:middle line:90%
And the agoraphobia subsided.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:32.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'm here because
of a lot of work.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And again, because of a
positive form of training

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and programming, and
because at some point,

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:42.080 align:middle line:84%
I got the assistance
of my command personnel

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.138 align:middle line:84%
instead of fighting
against them,

00:27:44.138 --> 00:27:45.680 align:middle line:84%
which is I tell
people who come to me

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and ask me about
what do they do.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.252 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, look, the
first thing you want to do

00:27:49.252 --> 00:27:52.160 align:middle line:84%
is understand that if you
find a way to cooperate

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.130 align:middle line:84%
with the people who are
in your chain of command,

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:58.400 align:middle line:84%
you'll do way better than if
you try and kick and scream.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.468 align:middle line:84%
Kicking and screaming
is not likely to get you

00:28:00.468 --> 00:28:01.760 align:middle line:90%
where you want to go with that.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.460 align:middle line:84%
Making positive
communication with people

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.900 align:middle line:84%
in your chain of
command are more

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.470 align:middle line:84%
likely to get them to help you
with the healing process, which

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:10.730 align:middle line:90%
is what happened in my case.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:12.897 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's why you're
actually here and have come

00:28:12.897 --> 00:28:15.440 align:middle line:84%
forward, because they kind
of like gave you permission,

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.170 align:middle line:84%
but you kind of allowed
them to give you permission.

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:19.130 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was a conversation
that my brigadier general

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.320 align:middle line:84%
had with me and
asked me if I wanted

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.580 align:middle line:90%
to go public with my story.

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.640 align:middle line:90%
And my initial response--

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.760 align:middle line:90%
I'll be kind--

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.160 align:middle line:84%
I swore a lot, and
I was very angry.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.830 align:middle line:90%
And I was not interested.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Over time we had conversations
that convinced me

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.300 align:middle line:84%
that it would be better than
doing what I was doing before.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.950 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I was asked by the
command staff of United States

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Marine Corps Special
Section to be their de

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.850 align:middle line:90%
facto public relations officer.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:49.420 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I got specifically
asked to do this.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And I reluctantly
agreed at first,

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:57.300 align:middle line:84%
but over time, my
brigadier was right.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.060 align:middle line:84%
This is way better than doing
what I was doing before.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you met people like
yourself that you recall

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.610 align:middle line:84%
or that have come up to
you, maybe had a little bit

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.340 align:middle line:84%
of a recall with this, and
do you communicate with them?

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>> A couple.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, one of them actually
showed up in my life

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.150 align:middle line:90%
earlier this year.

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was a pretty immediate
like, wait, I think I know you.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And then, really,
it was basically

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.600 align:middle line:84%
the trigger of a conversation,
do you remember da--

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and it was like,
oh, my god, yes.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, there's a couple
of people who have tracked me

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.810 align:middle line:90%
down, and said, I know you.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.310 align:middle line:90%
And here's the context where.

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And we sorted that
out in such a way

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.670 align:middle line:84%
without me divulging
personal information

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:51.330 align:middle line:84%
that there were things that we
knew about each other there was

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:53.283 align:middle line:84%
simply no way to
know unless we had

00:29:53.283 --> 00:29:54.450 align:middle line:90%
known each other personally.

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, I will also stipulate
I've had a few people also

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:02.050 align:middle line:84%
attempt to contact me and say,
oh, I'm sure that I know you.

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:04.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that we
served here or there.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:07.950 align:middle line:84%
But let's just say that those
people gave me a narrative

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.830 align:middle line:84%
that I looked at and went, no,
I don't think that's legit.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:14.580 align:middle line:84%
So you're still
dealing with this mess

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.620 align:middle line:84%
of people who have
legitimate experiences who

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.980 align:middle line:84%
are trying to sort
them out, people

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.710 align:middle line:84%
who have legitimate experiences,
but their brains are oatmeal--

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:23.880 align:middle line:90%
it's not their fault--

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.920 align:middle line:84%
and then people whose
brains are oatmeal.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And sorting out which is
which and who you can help

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.080 align:middle line:90%
and who you can't is difficult.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you see any of these
individuals coming out

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:38.550 align:middle line:84%
in the future, like you did,
as an insider and telling

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:40.140 align:middle line:90%
the world their story?

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Certainly this
one friend, I think,

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:46.590 align:middle line:84%
with some prodding I can
convince her to start talking.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:90%
But she's leery.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:50.190 align:middle line:90%
Understandably.

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:51.840 align:middle line:90%
But just leery at this point.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And just to be fair, most
people have no motivation

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.210 align:middle line:90%
and no self-interest in it.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:58.845 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't gain them anything.

00:30:58.845 --> 00:31:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>> They're not likely to benefit
hugely in any way, shape,

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:07.320 align:middle line:90%
or form from that.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.780 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be doing this
if I hadn't asked to,

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't a matter of
honor and duty and so forth.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:16.382 align:middle line:90%
So I can understand someone--

00:31:16.382 --> 00:31:17.340 align:middle line:90%
let me put it this way.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people who contact
me don't want to do interviews,

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.910 align:middle line:90%
don't want to be on TV or radio.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:26.220 align:middle line:84%
They just want to get
their lives back together.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.600 align:middle line:90%
That's really all they want.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.970 align:middle line:84%
They want some peace of mind
and some sanity in their world.

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:33.480 align:middle line:84%
But most of them
have no desire to.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.030 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any
desire to do this.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:37.830 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't like
what I wanted to do.

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:40.030 align:middle line:84%
My brigadier general
asked me if I wanted to.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:40.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:44.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's different than,
oh, yeah, I want to be on TV.

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:46.668 align:middle line:90%
I have no desire to be famous.

00:31:46.668 --> 00:31:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Randy, that
was fascinating.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:49.662 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming on the show.

00:31:49.662 --> 00:31:51.120 align:middle line:84%
It's always a
pleasure to have you.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:51.545 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you.

00:31:51.545 --> 00:31:53.010 align:middle line:84%
It's always a
pleasure to be here.

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."
