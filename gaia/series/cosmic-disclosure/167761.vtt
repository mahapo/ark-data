00:00:15.485 --> 00:00:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: All right.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.350 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back to
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.880 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.882 align:middle line:84%
And we are here
with Emery Smith.

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:23.090 align:middle line:90%
Emery, thanks for being here.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Oh, thanks
for having me again, Dave.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.580 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So in our
previous episode,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:84%
we started to talk about
these genetic programs that

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.990 align:middle line:84%
have been done,
including this idea

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.880 align:middle line:84%
of synthetic cells,
synthetic biology.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned
something that I think--

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:84%
it seems to come
very easily to you.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.130 align:middle line:10%
But it was probably
difficult for a lot of people

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.187 align:middle line:10%
to really grasp,
this idea that--

00:00:49.187 --> 00:00:50.770 align:middle line:10%
it sounds like from
what you're saying

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.870 align:middle line:10%
a very large number of
clones could be manufactured

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.700 align:middle line:10%
by various processes.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.730 align:middle line:10%
What is the fascination with
making all these clones?

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Why are they so involved in
manufacturing life forms?

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.060 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, I think
they have their own agenda.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.730 align:middle line:10%
And each organization
has its own agenda.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is, of course,
one operating everything.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.110 align:middle line:84%
But you have to understand
it trickles down

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.900 align:middle line:84%
to many different types
of facilities and agendas

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:90%
and organizations.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And you know, who knows
where it goes from there?

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.770 align:middle line:90%
But you know, I can have--

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:84%
I believe in my opinion
that they're doing

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.820 align:middle line:90%
this to maybe form a fake--

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:84%
or stage a fake invasion maybe,
or use these beings as part of,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.470 align:middle line:90%
you know--

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.400 align:middle line:84%
to serve in a war of some
sort, or to even possible use

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.440 align:middle line:90%
for abduction purposes.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Abduction
is something that

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.640 align:middle line:84%
began with Betty and Barney
Hill in the early 1960s.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.325 align:middle line:10%
And from that point forward,
we have these alleged grays

00:01:53.325 --> 00:01:56.530 align:middle line:10%
that are apparently doing this.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm curious as to why do
you think really there were not

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.640 align:middle line:84%
reports of gray abductions
before Betty and Barney Hill?

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And what might that
be that we're seeing?

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: This is the most
controversial question

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.880 align:middle line:90%
I get all the time.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And I have the
great answer for it.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And you know, these
people did get abducted.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.410 align:middle line:90%
It really did happen.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.817 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they can pass
a lot of the truth test.

00:02:24.817 --> 00:02:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And we've interviewed
a lot of these people.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.450 align:middle line:90%
And it's real.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they really had this
experience in their mind,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.400 align:middle line:90%
you know, or physically.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.690 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm getting at
is it wasn't real as far

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.430 align:middle line:84%
as the beings and the
stagecraft and the things that

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.270 align:middle line:90%
were going on.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Because there's many of these
stagecraft and these programs

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:84%
running the entire
planet because they

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:84%
all want them to
coincide together.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
So when we interview an
abductee from New Hampshire,

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.120 align:middle line:84%
they have the same exact story
as the abductee from Namibia

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.890 align:middle line:90%
and the abductee from Japan.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:84%
'Cause they make
them very similar.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll do
many different types

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.310 align:middle line:84%
of episodes of what
they want that person

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.460 align:middle line:84%
to see and remember, and how
to make them traumatized.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And they can do that in
many ways by, number one,

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:84%
using fake stagecraft, using
clone programmed life forms,

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.840 align:middle line:84%
knocking them out
first, and then

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
having them wake up in a
room with staged surgeons

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.820 align:middle line:84%
their prodding and
poking at them,

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.112 align:middle line:90%
using special types of gas.

00:03:38.112 --> 00:03:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wait a minute.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying that
the UFOs are fake?

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.691 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, they're-- right.

00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:44.230 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: But is there a craft?

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying that
there are craft?

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: There are craft.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they're real craft
that we reverse engineered.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.760 align:middle line:90%
But there are craft.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.080 align:middle line:84%
They are not the
extraterrestrial craft.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.704 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It's not
just like a hologram.

00:03:54.704 --> 00:03:55.510 align:middle line:90%
There is a craft.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, they can
use holograms too though.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.780 align:middle line:84%
That has been used in
staged moments, absolutely.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And they'll show the hologram,
and then maybe let off

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:90%
a gas in the area.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And the people
maybe crash the car.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Next thing you know, they
wake up in some facility.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.220 align:middle line:90%
But it's blurry.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
They're always groggy
for some reason.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:90%
You know, something happens.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll come to
the house and do it.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.964 align:middle line:84%
You know, they'll pick
a specific person.

00:04:19.964 --> 00:04:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Before
we go any further,

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I just want to ask you
this question, which

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:24.960 align:middle line:90%
I do know the answer to.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:84%
But I want to get you
to say it on camera.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Have you been watching
"Cosmic Disclosure"?

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Are you familiar with
all the ins and outs

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:90%
of what Corey has said?

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't watch it.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.720 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.587 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And the reason
for that is what?

00:04:36.587 --> 00:04:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I don't
like to be influenced

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:84%
by any type of outside source
of any type of outside source

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.330 align:middle line:84%
of information coming from
another person in case

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.730 align:middle line:84%
one day I might have
to come forward.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting sometimes
when you tell me, hey, Emery, I

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.490 align:middle line:84%
actually had an
insider that told

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.130 align:middle line:90%
me almost the exact same thing.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I know I'm
not the only one.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.290 align:middle line:84%
There's hundreds of
thousands of Emerys

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:84%
out there that are just
petrified to come forward.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hoping that
this series will

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.560 align:middle line:84%
bring a lot more people forward
to feel a little bit safer.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Because it does protect
you, I can assure you.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Why do you think
that these abductions are

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.010 align:middle line:90%
being done?

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.570 align:middle line:90%
We're kind of going around it.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.800 align:middle line:84%
But I don't feel like
we've quite hit it.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:84%
This is something that would
take incredible resources.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.310 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about craft.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
beings being cloned.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.660 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that it could
be in America, Namibia, Japan.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.410 align:middle line:90%
What is the point of all this?

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: To install
fear in the world.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, fear needs to be
installed to control and order.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, to have control
in order of a civilization.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So what better way to do that,
to have these people on TV

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:84%
saying that this
happened-- and I'm

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.290 align:middle line:90%
very compassionate about them.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.730 align:middle line:90%
Because it really did happen.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.370 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't happen
the way they think.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.170 align:middle line:84%
That's because
Hollywood has basically

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.040 align:middle line:84%
released an evil alien
movie every month.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And it goes from here to
the Philippines in a year.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And everyone in the
world is now petrified

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.902 align:middle line:84%
of this giant
creature coming at me.

00:06:13.902 --> 00:06:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you
remember last night

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.610 align:middle line:84%
when we were
talking to that guy,

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and you had told him about
the little Atacama being?

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And remember the
first question that he

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.570 align:middle line:84%
asked us was, am I
supposed to be afraid?

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Why do you
think that was the very--

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and he kept asking
it in different ways.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Like, am I supposed
to be scared about this?

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, we
shot them down.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to come back
with their guns and kill us?

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.900 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, and it's like
they know the risk.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Earth is
what I call the Disney

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.360 align:middle line:90%
World of the universe.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very dynamic,
beautiful place.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.150 align:middle line:90%
You would laugh.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.566 align:middle line:84%
You know, let's go see a bunch
of hairless monkeys, right?

00:06:50.566 --> 00:06:53.790 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm getting at is
it's so diverse community

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.600 align:middle line:84%
of so many living
biological species

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:84%
that they used to come
from all over just

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.880 align:middle line:84%
to kind of like hang out,
look around, and not do

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.020 align:middle line:90%
anything malicious or anything.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is in and out of
all the other negative stuff

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.380 align:middle line:84%
that has happened
millions of years

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.630 align:middle line:84%
ago with the different
civilizations, by the way.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:13.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm not getting into that.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.167 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying, in this time
of age, really the last 1,000

00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:18.750 align:middle line:84%
years, it was a
really beautiful place

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:90%
to come and show your kids.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.854 align:middle line:84%
And this comes down to now after
Roswell and a little bit before

00:07:26.854 --> 00:07:29.520 align:middle line:84%
that with the Germans, when they
realized there were these other

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.440 align:middle line:84%
entities, some formed
alliances, some didn't.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And next thing you know
is gas, coal and oil

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.110 align:middle line:84%
got involved and didn't want any
of this type of stuff going on,

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.370 align:middle line:90%
or the government.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Because if you prove how
extraterrestrials get here,

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.970 align:middle line:84%
they weren't using
gas, coal, and oil.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:52.860 align:middle line:84%
But getting back to your
question, why did he say this?

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like, they're
going to come back

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.340 align:middle line:84%
because we just
killed his family,

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.320 align:middle line:90%
or we shot down a craft.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well,
you know, they're

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.890 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more conscious than
we are by a few million years.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.200 align:middle line:90%
And they were once us.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And they're watching us grow out
of this barbaric medieval way

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.230 align:middle line:84%
of cutting each
other's heads off.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we haven't
been back to the moon,

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.950 align:middle line:84%
or you know, ventured into
space with the normal NASA space

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.120 align:middle line:90%
program, that is.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.047 align:middle line:10%
And that's this whole
stunted thing is

00:08:25.047 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:10%
until we learn how to
behave with each other

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.670 align:middle line:10%
and love each other
and accept each other

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:34.169 align:middle line:10%
and not have this
association of you're

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.630 align:middle line:10%
my enemy because you don't
believe what I believe in,

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.600 align:middle line:10%
or you're a different
color of race or gender,

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.590 align:middle line:10%
it's ridiculous.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.960 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't exist in the
higher consciousness

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.690 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials
beyond this universe.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.450 align:middle line:84%
So they're giving us
time to behave and time

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.490 align:middle line:90%
to work it out on our own.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
see this happen.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And they're really
interested in that.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of what I
believe they're there for.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I had
Whitley Strieber, who

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.480 align:middle line:84%
was the famous guy who
wrote the book "Communion,"

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.670 align:middle line:84%
kind of broke the
alien abduction

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.130 align:middle line:90%
story in a big way in the 1980s.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.400 align:middle line:10%
I had with Whitley Strieber
on my panel at Conscious Life

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:10%
Expo in February 2017.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
I thought was fascinating

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:22.930 align:middle line:84%
was that he reported having
more memories of his abduction,

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.600 align:middle line:84%
and that he wasn't
just seeing grays.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.170 align:middle line:84%
He was also seeing
regular humans

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.210 align:middle line:90%
in black military uniforms.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.224 align:middle line:90%
who were there at the same time.

00:09:34.224 --> 00:09:35.890 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is
going on with that?

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: What has
happened is, yeah,

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.520 align:middle line:84%
he was probably moved to an
installation or something.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe the Black Ops
team for that division,

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.350 align:middle line:84%
when he came to a little
bit, his memory caught

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:48.340 align:middle line:90%
a glimpse of it.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we give
medication every day.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Every day, we'll do
thousands and millions

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.369 align:middle line:90%
of surgeries around the world.

00:09:53.369 --> 00:09:55.510 align:middle line:84%
We always give
patients Versed right

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.970 align:middle line:84%
before they go so in
case we do mess up,

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.590 align:middle line:84%
or they don't hear
us telling jokes

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:02.410 align:middle line:84%
while we're operating on their
heart, they won't remember it.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's very successful.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.480 align:middle line:84%
But they do sometimes
have a total recall.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's bad.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.280 align:middle line:90%
That has happened.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.976 align:middle line:84%
You can Google that where
people are actually awake

00:10:12.976 --> 00:10:15.100 align:middle line:84%
during the whole procedure
and remember everything.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Or they'll hear
everything and remember it.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And they can't move 'cause
the anesthesiologist

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.025 align:middle line:90%
has paralyzed them.

00:10:22.025 --> 00:10:22.825 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:10:22.825 --> 00:10:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, very
scary situation.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:26.710 align:middle line:90%
So that's what happened.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.560 align:middle line:84%
He is getting a
little bit of a recall

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.730 align:middle line:84%
back because the drugs didn't
work on him, or the gas.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.170 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: So this
abduction program

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:39.470 align:middle line:10%
would be to instill
fear on a mass scale.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Correct.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So there was a sense
when Whitley was saying this

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.630 align:middle line:84%
that he might have been
abducted by the military.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that there
are real grays doing

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.280 align:middle line:84%
real abductions that are
actual extraterrestrials?

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think that this is
just a vast weird government

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.360 align:middle line:90%
program of some kind?

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I believe
it's a program.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.840 align:middle line:10%
I believe there have been--

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.150 align:middle line:10%
there may have been,
not to my knowledge--

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:11.700 align:middle line:10%
there may have been like real
abductions a very, very, very

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.840 align:middle line:10%
long time ago because of
certain countries that

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.560 align:middle line:10%
were making some weird,
bad mistakes of exchange

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.000 align:middle line:10%
of information maybe for DNA.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:84%
But it's hard for me
to believe that now,

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.410 align:middle line:84%
after what I've been
exposed to, knowing

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.040 align:middle line:90%
what they can do anyway--

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.070 align:middle line:84%
like I said, they
don't need anything.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:38.070 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot more to
that story with other beings

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.480 align:middle line:90%
and other things.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.740 align:middle line:84%
So I believe it's a
complete form of military

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.070 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of
faction organization

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.580 align:middle line:84%
that works beyond the
military that's doing this.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now I remember at
least three or four times

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:55.860 align:middle line:84%
seeing Dr. Steven
Greer speak on stage.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And you were standing there
on stage in full tactical gear

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.980 align:middle line:90%
as his security guard.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And in some of those talks,
he mentioned a UN Secretary

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:90%
General being abducted.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And that is the highest
level of politics on Earth.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.330 align:middle line:90%
So what could be going on?

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Why would this production
go all the way up

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.860 align:middle line:84%
to the elected heads
of state in the highest

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.091 align:middle line:90%
offices in the world?

00:12:24.091 --> 00:12:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They wanted
to install fear

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:30.120 align:middle line:84%
into the other people that
were in these higher positions

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.950 align:middle line:90%
by doing it to this one.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: So you can confirm--

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.162 align:middle line:84%
or can you confirm
that that actually

00:12:35.162 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:84%
did happen, that that
abduction happened?

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.453 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That's
secondhand information

00:12:38.453 --> 00:12:40.990 align:middle line:84%
from two very higher ups
in DC, and also, of course,

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:44.610 align:middle line:84%
working with Dr. Greer
and the Disclosure Project

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and seeing a lot of
the official documents

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.620 align:middle line:90%
that he had shared with me, yes.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:90%
He is correct.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So are there
hypnotic suggestions

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.790 align:middle line:84%
being planted in people's minds
as well when this takes place?

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Are they getting
post-hypnotic suggestion,

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.846 align:middle line:84%
things that will be cued
by events that took place--

00:13:00.846 --> 00:13:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There are no hypnotic
or mind control things going on

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:08.890 align:middle line:84%
unless you watch TV or have an
iPhone or listen to the radio.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.630 align:middle line:90%
So good luck with that one.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So in your
estimation, there

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.580 align:middle line:84%
could be subliminals
that are being put out.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.447 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: 100% that's
definitely happening.

00:13:20.447 --> 00:13:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you have
secondhand knowledge of that?

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Or do you actually
see briefings on it?

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.249 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, I've seen--

00:13:25.249 --> 00:13:28.500 align:middle line:84%
I was part of a project
one time in Los Alamos--

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.900 align:middle line:84%
well, it wasn't
owned by Los Alamos.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.200 align:middle line:84%
But it was associated
with a corporation there--

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.490 align:middle line:84%
that dealt with frequency
control, mind control

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and cellular frequency
control to make you angry

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:49.370 align:middle line:84%
or to make you sad or to, you
know, manipulate you in a way

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.362 align:middle line:90%
that this would happen.

00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Getting back
to Betty and Barney

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Hill, as we've drilled into this
more over the years in ufology,

00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:00.020 align:middle line:84%
it has emerged that he
actually was testifying

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.500 align:middle line:84%
early along that he thought
this was a military abduction.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And he had very
specific details.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.750 align:middle line:10%
And then, as time
went on, more and more

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.440 align:middle line:10%
of the so-called alien
component came in.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.250 align:middle line:84%
His initial impression was that
it was not extraterrestrial.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.245 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I wonder why.

00:14:18.245 --> 00:14:20.390 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's very realistic.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, they have these
alien reproduction vehicles.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have conquered
anti-gravity for the elites.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.090 align:middle line:84%
So it wouldn't be
hard for me to fly

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:31.610 align:middle line:84%
one of these devices
over your house

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and jump out in a very
expensive Hollywood alien suit

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and try to convince
you to do what I say.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And especially when I have
these frequency devices

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.440 align:middle line:84%
that I'm beaming at you that
basically paralyze you or stun

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.370 align:middle line:84%
you for a certain time while
I object you to put you out.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: There was a
particular insider disclosure

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.720 align:middle line:84%
about the Illuminati
that I read.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Very, very disturbing book
called "Paperclip Dolls."

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
female witness

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.900 align:middle line:84%
went through a lot of
the most savage stuff

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.980 align:middle line:84%
that you hear about
in ritual abuse cases.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:13.070 align:middle line:84%
But she also reported having
to wear an alien suit,

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.950 align:middle line:84%
having to dress up in this
kind of silvery alien suit

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.160 align:middle line:84%
with a head that
looked like a gray,

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and actually abuse
people in that capacity.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Wow.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: And that's in the book.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.740 align:middle line:84%
So are there cases
where people--

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.344 align:middle line:84%
where you could confirm that
maybe in older programs?

00:15:30.344 --> 00:15:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I can confirm
there's hundreds of thousands

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.634 align:middle line:84%
of people that go missing
just in the United States

00:15:34.634 --> 00:15:35.480 align:middle line:90%
alone every year.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.210 align:middle line:84%
But you don't hear about it
except for a couple of websites

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.820 align:middle line:84%
because they're the
derelicts and the drug users

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.070 align:middle line:90%
or the homeless or the runaways.

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that these
people are being collected

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:51.800 align:middle line:84%
and tested and also
seeing the response

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.260 align:middle line:84%
and measuring the
chemicals of the person

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.600 align:middle line:84%
while they're actually
being attacked

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:84%
by someone dressed in a
suit or something like that.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Because for some
reason, they're trying

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:03.950 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what
kind of chemicals

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.785 align:middle line:84%
are released with
this type of fear.

00:16:05.785 --> 00:16:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Could you tell us
a little more about some

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:11.280 align:middle line:84%
of the stagecraft that you said
is happening in these abduction

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.080 align:middle line:90%
cases?

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Like what are we
actually looking at?

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.110 align:middle line:84%
They don't always have
to use a real craft.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:16.990 align:middle line:90%
But it always helps.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm getting at is
these ARVs, we call them,

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.000 align:middle line:84%
alien reproduction
vehicles do exist.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.830 align:middle line:90%
And I have seen them firsthand.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And they're not as
well-created of course

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:30.340 align:middle line:84%
as the original
extraterrestrial crafts

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.990 align:middle line:84%
that they try to
reverse engineer them.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.020 align:middle line:84%
But they do what
they're supposed to do.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And that is hover
and look scary.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's all you need to see.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And then it could be done,
and the next thing you know,

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.810 align:middle line:90%
you're kind of knocked out.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.940 align:middle line:84%
But you remember that
before the drugs.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So they want you have a
visual of a little guy running

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.050 align:middle line:84%
across the street in
front of your car first,

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.050 align:middle line:84%
or maybe this thing
that just landed

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:55.640 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the interstate.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.942 align:middle line:90%
Because you'll remember that.

00:16:56.942 --> 00:16:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's all
you're going to talk

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.530 align:middle line:84%
about the rest of your
life is the most amazing,

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.180 align:middle line:90%
horrific, scary thing.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:07.384 align:middle line:84%
Because then you woke up in
another temporary tent set up

00:17:07.384 --> 00:17:08.800 align:middle line:84%
in the woods right
off the street.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And they're making it look
like an operating room.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Someone caught a glimpse
of some guy carrying

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.000 align:middle line:84%
an M16 and a tactical
vest they remember.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.579 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
classical typical thing

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.900 align:middle line:90%
that happens all the time.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:23.550 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: It would appear that if
we are dealing with a globalist

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:27.420 align:middle line:10%
organization that's doing
all this behind the scenes

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:31.530 align:middle line:10%
that they have a
lot of limitations,

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:34.110 align:middle line:10%
that there is some sort
of benevolent force

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.210 align:middle line:10%
that is stopping
them from doing more.

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Because these abductions are
not really that bad, right?

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.470 align:middle line:90%
People are getting returned.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:41.950 align:middle line:90%
They don't remember very much.

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:42.750 align:middle line:90%
They're not--

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They need
them to return.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.180 align:middle line:84%
They have to be
healthy because they

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:84%
won't be able to tell the
story the rest of their life.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.340 align:middle line:90%
But yes.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But there is some
aspect of opposition to this.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.844 align:middle line:90%
It's not like it's just evil.

00:17:52.844 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: As you notice,
these abductions

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:58.530 align:middle line:84%
have been going downhill, not
uphill, since the '60s, '50s.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is because of this
alliance that has been formed.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, a high
percentage now knows

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.120 align:middle line:90%
that we don't need to do this.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.740 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to go this route.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.827 align:middle line:84%
And you know, this other
part of it, you know,

00:18:11.827 --> 00:18:13.410 align:middle line:84%
whatever you call
them the white hats,

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:14.940 align:middle line:84%
or however you guys--
there's many different terms

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.230 align:middle line:90%
you guys use.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:22.350 align:middle line:84%
But you know, we're now at the
level of 90% good, 10% bad.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
come pretty quick here.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.330 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be exposed.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And the truth will come out
about all of these programs.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the politicians
are leaning more towards that

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:40.700 align:middle line:84%
because they're not taking care
of their families properly.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
protecting their families.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they're extorting them
by drugging them and making

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:50.765 align:middle line:84%
them have sex with an
underage person on film.

00:18:50.765 --> 00:18:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And now you have
to do everything

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.080 align:middle line:90%
I say for the rest of your--

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.976 align:middle line:84%
and you know this
stuff, how it goes.

00:18:56.976 --> 00:18:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How do
you think, or how

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.070 align:middle line:84%
does the alliance think based
on briefings you've had,

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:04.650 align:middle line:84%
what will happen once they've
really crossed the line

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually disclosed
instead of just people

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.000 align:middle line:90%
wondering maybe it's true?

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The polls show that
mostly everyone does believe

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:17.530 align:middle line:84%
in this, like a high percentage,
78% believe there is existence

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.270 align:middle line:90%
beyond this planet.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Right and the problem is how
many believe they're evil

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.840 align:middle line:90%
and how many believe--

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.970 align:middle line:84%
there are good and
bad, absolutely.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.650 align:middle line:84%
But how many people
believe what?

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.040 align:middle line:84%
How many people believe
that the good is trying

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.410 align:middle line:90%
to protect us more than evil?

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And how can we show
that and prove that

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:42.210 align:middle line:84%
without having people come
forward and talk about it

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:45.300 align:middle line:90%
and release this information?

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.557 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I want to bring
this up too, Emery.

00:19:47.557 --> 00:19:49.140 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that we talked about

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.070 align:middle line:84%
and we laughed last night,
but it's kind of true,

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:58.380 align:middle line:84%
is that let's just say a
significant number of Americans

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.450 align:middle line:90%
have never forgiven Vietnam.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And on some level, they're
still fighting the Vietnam War.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.770 align:middle line:84%
They're still
listening to the music.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.390 align:middle line:84%
They still worship
the musicians who

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.160 align:middle line:90%
became famous during that time.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.430 align:middle line:84%
They act like nothing else
has happened that's really

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.750 align:middle line:90%
of value since then in music.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And we have this kind of horror
of the military in America.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's very sad
because like we talked about,

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.400 align:middle line:84%
if there was a red dawn
scenario, if we actually

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.710 align:middle line:84%
had a land invasion, we
lose a couple of states

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.816 align:middle line:90%
to a foreign invading power.

00:20:29.816 --> 00:20:31.190 align:middle line:84%
At that point,
what would happen?

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants the
military back again.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, your attitude
changes pretty quickly when

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.140 align:middle line:90%
you start to lose your freedom.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And even though people are
angry from past wars and things

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:49.730 align:middle line:84%
like this, when you come
back home, it's difficult.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And when you have these
old programs in you

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.864 align:middle line:84%
from those times
with these soldiers--

00:20:58.864 --> 00:21:00.530 align:middle line:84%
and I can speak because
I am a soldier--

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:03.080 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.690 align:middle line:90%
you form this against mode.

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Like that's all.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:09.552 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:21:09.552 --> 00:21:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Everything else is
going to be bad.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And I lost my faith in the
government, and da-da-da-da.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.130 align:middle line:84%
But it does change
quickly when there

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.280 align:middle line:90%
is a threat in your backyard.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.710 align:middle line:84%
OK, my neighbor's playing
the music really loud.

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.200 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:84%
But now I just jump the fence
with a 12-gauge shotgun.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And he's kind of coming up to
the porch, that's not normal.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.300 align:middle line:84%
So you know, you want to
help protect your home.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.850 align:middle line:90%
And you want to have that fence.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.661 align:middle line:84%
And that fence
needs to be there,

00:21:40.661 --> 00:21:41.910 align:middle line:90%
and maybe a little bit higher.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So people have a change of
heart if something like that

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:45.510 align:middle line:90%
would happen.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Because people have families,
and people don't want war.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:52.930 align:middle line:90%
People are not born to have war.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:57.480 align:middle line:84%
If you asked the majority of the
world without the warmongers,

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.050 align:middle line:84%
you know, do you
want to go fight?

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:04.560 align:middle line:84%
If a human had a chance
to fight or not fight,

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.440 align:middle line:84%
the polls show they
would not want to fight.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.610 align:middle line:90%
All of them.

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:13.650 align:middle line:84%
So who is controlling
all these soldiers?

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:17.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of where
it's at right now is just

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.090 align:middle line:90%
a bunch of puppets.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:22.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's going to be exposed.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I think a
lot of people feel

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.220 align:middle line:84%
as if the wars
that we have fought

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:32.900 align:middle line:84%
are wars for empire and
domination to control oil,

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.990 align:middle line:84%
to control poppy
fields in Afghanistan.

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:38.510 align:middle line:84%
That it's all about
money and profit.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And there are so
few people who are

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:84%
directly aware of the alliance
who have ever spoken out

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:45.140 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.540 align:middle line:84%
What could you tell the
people who might still

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:51.050 align:middle line:84%
be locked in this belief system
that the military is just

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:53.930 align:middle line:84%
out there doing the whims
of globalist bankers?

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And then they would ask,
well, if there is an alliance,

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.980 align:middle line:90%
why haven't we heard from them?

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I can
assure you that that man

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.660 align:middle line:84%
on the front line
and his commander

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.850 align:middle line:84%
and even that
general most likely

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:08.790 align:middle line:84%
has no clue about
what's really going on.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But I'm so gung ho
about my country,

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do
whatever it takes.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
protect it, and I'm

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:84%
gonna protect my mom and dad
and my sister and so forth.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:22.850 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to do that
because I'm 18 years old.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:24.590 align:middle line:90%
And I believe in this.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:26.030 align:middle line:90%
I believe in this.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:29.107 align:middle line:84%
So they made you believe
in this with all of the--

00:23:29.107 --> 00:23:29.940 align:middle line:90%
however it happened.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:34.160 align:middle line:84%
So now that this is coming
out, the nonbelievers are

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:37.850 align:middle line:84%
going to say, well, where
are these superheroes?

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:38.840 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:42.570 align:middle line:90%
And you cannot fight a war--

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:46.560 align:middle line:84%
the war is not fought
hand-to-hand combat.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:51.030 align:middle line:84%
It's fought way behind
the scenes first

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:57.580 align:middle line:84%
to control who's controlling
the generals and the commanders.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.394 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
change that first.

00:23:59.394 --> 00:24:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's what people
don't understand.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a very delicate
and very difficult

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.250 align:middle line:84%
situation that's going
on, this little secret war

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:07.720 align:middle line:90%
behind the scenes.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
changes the paradigm.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:12.550 align:middle line:84%
That's what's going to
make everything tilt.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: It seems as if
there's an astonishing lack

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.510 align:middle line:84%
of truthfulness in
mainstream media.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:20.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's become--

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even the polls are now
showing distrust in the media

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:25.930 align:middle line:84%
is actually worse than
distrust in Congress.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:29.300 align:middle line:84%
It's lower than
12% in some cases.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So do you feel that the media is
in cahoots with this globalist

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.190 align:middle line:90%
crime syndicate in some way?

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, I know they are.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the media
controls the world.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So with that
kind of power in place,

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.450 align:middle line:84%
would that pose a
problem for the alliance

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:84%
if they were to
try to let us know

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.440 align:middle line:90%
what they were doing right now?

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.500 align:middle line:84%
With that much media control
still in that apparatus

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:57.520 align:middle line:90%
still in place?

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, because
that will be fixed.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.870 align:middle line:90%
That will be taken out.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.510 align:middle line:84%
The leaders that
control the media

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:08.710 align:middle line:84%
are going to have a big
eye-opening problem soon.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.600 align:middle line:10%
And the alliance
is working on that

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:15.490 align:middle line:10%
through the inside actually,
rather than from the outside.

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:17.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to
come from within.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually going to
have to do with also civilians,

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.950 align:middle line:84%
which is nice to
know that people

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:26.590 align:middle line:84%
are going to stand up too
and find out that, hey, this

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:27.610 align:middle line:90%
isn't right.

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:29.230 align:middle line:90%
We've been lied to.

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be brought
to an attention

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:36.260 align:middle line:90%
in a way called live streaming.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And no matter if it's only
on there for five seconds,

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:40.960 align:middle line:84%
I can guarantee you
someone recorded it.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.810 align:middle line:90%
And it'll go.

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So they would have to shut
down all the main servers

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.960 align:middle line:84%
in those tanker ships off
the coast of California

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and everywhere else in the
world for that not to go viral.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And it won't be just one
person, it'll be many.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.640 align:middle line:90%
It will be hundreds of people.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.690 align:middle line:90%
So that will help.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:00.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have unheard
superheroes on the ground.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.392 align:middle line:84%
You have unheard
superheroes way above.

00:26:02.392 --> 00:26:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And they're all working
towards the same thing.

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:05.854 align:middle line:84%
And that's to
expose that problem.

00:26:05.854 --> 00:26:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: There's been a lot
of unpleasant stuff coming out

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:09.172 align:middle line:90%
about Hollywood.

00:26:09.172 --> 00:26:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering if
you think that might

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.220 align:middle line:90%
be part of the alliance's plan.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, without
mentioning movies or anything,

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Hollywood is also kind of
controlling how we think.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But they also encrypt
really cool things into it

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.730 align:middle line:84%
for those people who are aware
of symbology and different

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.180 align:middle line:90%
languages and texts.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think that helps
because I believe

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:41.180 align:middle line:84%
that's a subliminal message
that things are sometimes

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.314 align:middle line:84%
moving to the direction
that it needs to go.

00:26:43.314 --> 00:26:44.480 align:middle line:90%
And that's where it's going.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
important for people

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.510 align:middle line:84%
to know that the message
is being sent out.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:52.410 align:middle line:84%
If you can't see
it yet, it's OK.

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:53.450 align:middle line:90%
You will.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:55.080 align:middle line:90%
It'll be in another form.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So really
blunt, dumb question.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Is the military working
for our best good?

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And if so, will the abductions
stop once they succeed?

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, the military is
definitely on our side 100%.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:15.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, the higher-ups
are getting very

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.340 align:middle line:90%
upset about the manipulation.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.410 align:middle line:90%
They have their own agents.

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.260 align:middle line:84%
They're starting
to find out things.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:26.022 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very good sign that
this is happening right now.

00:27:26.022 --> 00:27:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You've said that
the abductions have already

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:29.340 align:middle line:90%
decreased a lot.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, are you telling me that the
military alliance people have

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.090 align:middle line:84%
already been fighting a
war to greatly reduce how

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:37.349 align:middle line:90%
many abductions are happening?

00:27:37.349 --> 00:27:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, I believe
it's more of a money thing

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:42.960 align:middle line:84%
going into secret corporations
THAT used to use the military

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.100 align:middle line:90%
to help them do things.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.300 align:middle line:84%
But the military didn't know
why they were going to pick up

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.490 align:middle line:84%
or going to this place
and slice up a cow.

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:52.380 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
why they were going

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:56.400 align:middle line:84%
to go pick up this individual
or take part in this.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.030 align:middle line:84%
They just know, I'm there to
come here and provide security.

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:01.829 align:middle line:84%
They have no idea
what's going on.

00:28:01.829 --> 00:28:03.120 align:middle line:90%
And they're not allowed to ask.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And if they do, then they're
terminated immediately.

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:08.910 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: If this cabal, as
a lot of people call it--

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:10.890 align:middle line:10%
that's a term that
I'm using now--

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:15.200 align:middle line:10%
if the cabal is defeated,
the disturbing things we've

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.610 align:middle line:10%
talked about in this
episode with abduction,

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:19.670 align:middle line:10%
will that largely,
if not completely,

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.350 align:middle line:10%
be stopped at the same time?

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.600 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yes, if the
cabal is defeated.

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.910 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: So in a sense then,
we're having like a shadow

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:27.550 align:middle line:10%
World War III going on.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's right.

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And so many people are
completely unaware that it's

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:33.372 align:middle line:90%
even happening.

00:28:33.372 --> 00:28:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's right there
in front of your eyes

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:37.730 align:middle line:84%
if you really think about
it and look at what's

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:39.720 align:middle line:90%
going on around the world.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.540 align:middle line:84%
But you know, we don't
have time for that.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the people's
fault. I have to work.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.741 align:middle line:90%
I have to eat tonight.

00:28:47.741 --> 00:28:49.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have
to do these things.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm in the matrix too, guys.

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:54.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, what
am I going to do?

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.020 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm going to conform too.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.030 align:middle line:84%
We all have to conform
for a little bit.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:01.312 align:middle line:84%
But now it's time to
give back a little bit.

00:29:01.312 --> 00:29:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What do you
think the world will

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:07.142 align:middle line:84%
look like once we get disclosure
and the cabal's defeated?

00:29:07.142 --> 00:29:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Overnight,
it will change.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.090 align:middle line:84%
The devices of all the
technology they've been hiding

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:12.080 align:middle line:90%
will come.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.910 align:middle line:90%
The world will flourish.

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:16.040 align:middle line:90%
It will be full abundance.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.830 align:middle line:90%
No one will starve.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:19.970 align:middle line:84%
It'll be clean
water for everyone.

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:22.280 align:middle line:90%
It will be homes for everyone.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And the world will
come together as one.

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And everything else
will be left behind.

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And the old paradigm, we will
forget about our religions

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:32.960 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.626 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, all
of this is getting

00:29:34.626 --> 00:29:36.210 align:middle line:90%
exposed too at the same time.

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:41.790 align:middle line:84%
So it changes how we were kind
of tricked since we were born.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.450 align:middle line:90%
And now the truth is here.

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:47.396 align:middle line:84%
And now everyone will apologize,
and it will be beautiful.

00:29:47.396 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, Emery, I want
to thank you for being here.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.311 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank
you for watching.

00:29:51.311 --> 00:29:52.940 align:middle line:90%
This is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Dave Wilcock,
with our special guest Emery

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.120 align:middle line:90%
Smith.
