00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:21.710 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.320 align:middle line:10%
we're in an undisclosed
location with Tim.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.980 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.150 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies in relation

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.510 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial groups
in contact with Earth.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.620 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Hi, Emery.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, you have a deep
knowledge from years of working

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.580 align:middle line:90%
with Greys.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And in pop culture, Greys
are like the biggest thing

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.720 align:middle line:84%
because it's part of alien
culture of the pop culture.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.310 align:middle line:90%
What do you think that is for?

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: See, the Greys have a
huge state that also interacts

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.610 align:middle line:84%
with different star
systems, different planets.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.980 align:middle line:84%
They even take an administration
for foreign planets and star

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So they have this agenda
to move everything

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.490 align:middle line:90%
into a certain direction.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And while other species try
to be noninvasive with that

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.870 align:middle line:84%
and keep the natural flow
and evolution of a planet,

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.550 align:middle line:84%
the Greys have
this kind of belief

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:84%
that it is good to
influence something

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.710 align:middle line:90%
and to correct certain things.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And they also did that with
timelines on planet Earth.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, you've
been working with Greys.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And are these the same Greys
that were in the Roswell crash?

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yes and no.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.660 align:middle line:84%
I think that there
are two species that

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.110 align:middle line:84%
were the main players
in the Roswell event.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.110 align:middle line:84%
So on the one hand,
there is the species that

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:90%
is called Ebens, as I've read.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And the other species
that possibly took action

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:90%
in that incident were the Greys.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How did your
relationship with the Greys

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:90%
actually develop?

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.880 align:middle line:90%
And when?

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So I've years of
interactions with the Greys.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.226 align:middle line:84%
And in the first
place, it was pretty--

00:02:27.226 --> 00:02:31.950 align:middle line:84%
mhm, I was kind of
pushed in the cold water.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So that was pretty
much nothing that we

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:90%
could rely on, but the--

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was that like a
facility you're speaking

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.300 align:middle line:90%
of or on your own in the field?

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: No, there
were direct meetings,

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.300 align:middle line:84%
which I assume were set up by
the Greys because they were

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.090 align:middle line:84%
interacting with people
on Earth already.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.230 align:middle line:84%
They also had a very, well,
pretty good understanding

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.450 align:middle line:84%
of German languages
and earthly languages.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.500 align:middle line:84%
So what they did
was handing over

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.560 align:middle line:84%
some kind of tablet
which already

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:90%
had some translations in it.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.360 align:middle line:84%
But as their
language evolved far

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.570 align:middle line:84%
beyond what the German
language and earthly languages

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:27.350 align:middle line:84%
are about, there are some
words and some expressions

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.968 align:middle line:84%
that just do not appear
in our vocabulary.

00:03:32.968 --> 00:03:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So what did
the Greys sound like?

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.650 align:middle line:90%
And what is their language?

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Mm-hmm.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And do they use some
sort of translator for that?

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Mhm, so it's difficult
to make an impression of that,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:84%
but they have this kind of
metallic sound that they use.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.310 align:middle line:84%
But they tend to not
communicate acoustically.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.790 align:middle line:84%
They have these
kind of tablets, not

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.330 align:middle line:84%
really an iPad because
I don't remember

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.400 align:middle line:90%
any plastics or something.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.880 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly like some
crystalline glass.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And in one half of
the display, you

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.140 align:middle line:84%
have the hieroglyphs
and the signs

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.209 align:middle line:84%
that they use in
written language.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And on the other half, you have
the German translation, which

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.000 align:middle line:90%
obviously comes from them.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.200 align:middle line:84%
So they analyzed
probably English as well

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.420 align:middle line:84%
and mostly all the important
languages on Earth.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.920 align:middle line:84%
But at some times, like when
you use Google Translate

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.495 align:middle line:90%
and it's just a little bit off.

00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Off a little bit.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Yeah, and that is
because they have a much more

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.480 align:middle line:90%
expanded consciousness.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And some words and
expressions just don't appear.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So they
don't speak German?

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: They can speak German.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.480 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: How?

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: For example, they
have the technology to appear

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:84%
in human forms and use kind of
avatars or robotics to do that.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And then they can
speak German, but there

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.060 align:middle line:84%
are small subtle
details in languages

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:90%
that make the difference.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And also when you work with
a foreign force or power,

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.160 align:middle line:84%
it's at some point
very important

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle line:84%
to be very close
to the expression

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and what they want to
bring into the world.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle line:84%
For example, one big question
is, what is their agenda?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.270 align:middle line:84%
So every word has to
be analyzed very well.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And wasn't that part
of your work to work on that

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.620 align:middle line:90%
translation to German?

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yes, it was.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.300 align:middle line:90%
So one very important thing is--

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and this is a term in
governance science--

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.200 align:middle line:90%
is to find out thier credo.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.010 align:middle line:84%
It's what people could call a
motto or their belief system.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:84%
This is what do they
want from Earth.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And when I was asking them,
they had three hieroglyphs

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.210 align:middle line:90%
appearing on the display.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:84%
The first two were
pretty easy to translate.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.040 align:middle line:84%
It was to serve
and was to protect.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was the third hieroglyph
that was kind of an issue.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.940 align:middle line:90%
So we did all we can.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing all
I can to find out

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:84%
and to move forward
and backwards to have

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:47.020 align:middle line:84%
an expression that appears in
earthly languages that comes

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.230 align:middle line:84%
very close to what they mean
because as you can imagine,

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.550 align:middle line:84%
it's really important
for the destiny of Earth

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.540 align:middle line:84%
to know what is the third
hieroglyph's meaning.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:06.630 align:middle line:84%
So it came into realization
that it meant to synthesize.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What does synthesize
mean in that context?

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: In chemistry,
we have synthesis,

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.940 align:middle line:84%
which means to extract a
piece and put it into another

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:90%
substrate or into another whole.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And that is pretty
close to what they do.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.140 align:middle line:84%
They extract pieces of
a whole; of a memory

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.080 align:middle line:84%
system of a collective,
for example, a planetary

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.980 align:middle line:90%
collective.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:40.320 align:middle line:84%
They extract certain
individuals and put them

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.940 align:middle line:84%
into a different system,
a different reality

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:50.040 align:middle line:84%
in order to preserve their
kind of evolutionary path

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.120 align:middle line:84%
while benefiting from that
because, as I've already

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.840 align:middle line:84%
mentioned, they have
lost some kind of path,

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.390 align:middle line:90%
some spiritual connection.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is to extract
other parts of the universe

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.430 align:middle line:84%
and benefit from
their experience.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So Tim, how
did they achieve that?

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So for them, they were
calling it preserving the tonal

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:20.190 align:middle line:84%
dynamics of the universe,
which means that every soul,

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:84%
based on their own
individual experiences,

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:27.220 align:middle line:84%
had a kind of
evolutionary path to it.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And there's a natural force
that, as we've already

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.669 align:middle line:84%
talked about, seems to
extract souls and put them

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.409 align:middle line:90%
into different experiences.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:42.480 align:middle line:84%
So the universe as a whole
can benefit from that.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:84%
The Greys seemed to be
the highway to that.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:52.260 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is they
do the calculations

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and algorithm based on
what they see and know

00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.930 align:middle line:84%
from one individual or even a
whole collective of a planet

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.670 align:middle line:90%
or even a star system.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And they build kind of new
experience so that it--

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.520 align:middle line:84%
well, it benefits
the individual,

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.250 align:middle line:84%
but as well as the
Greys because they

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:20.800 align:middle line:84%
benefit from every mutual
evolution in the universe.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So they would
intervene if the planet was

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.520 align:middle line:84%
going to be destroyed possibly
on different timelines?

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Yes, they have the
stocks in the Earth people,

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.800 align:middle line:84%
at least, certain Earth
people, not all of them,

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:41.130 align:middle line:84%
but some that are dedicated
to the whole of the universe.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And those are pretty
important to them.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And they will intervene
when a timeline of the Earth

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.080 align:middle line:90%
would fail.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And they have done
that several times.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you have
an example of this?

00:09:54.820 --> 00:10:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So see, we wouldn't be
here if they haven't done some

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.570 align:middle line:84%
cleaning work on the
timeline because--

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.890 align:middle line:90%
and we come to that later.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:08.580 align:middle line:84%
There are other species that are
also capable of time traveling,

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.600 align:middle line:90%
influencing timelines.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And they might have
some different agenda

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:20.940 align:middle line:84%
to the overall evolution
of Earth people.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So you probably know
that there appeared

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.760 align:middle line:84%
a lot of UFOs in the
time when the Cold

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.040 align:middle line:90%
War was pretty heavy on.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are timelines where,
for example, the Cuba crisis

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.860 align:middle line:90%
didn't turn out that well.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are you saying
that the Cuban Missile Crisis

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and the Bay of Pigs--
there was an intervention?

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: What I'm saying's that
there are several occasions

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.700 align:middle line:84%
where the timeline of the Earth
could have failed in the past.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And they stepped
in and corrected it

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.300 align:middle line:84%
so much that we now
are experiencing

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:12.200 align:middle line:90%
a kind of stable timeline.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What do you know
about their history and origins?

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, I can tell
you what they told me.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:26.060 align:middle line:84%
So the Greys-- and we need
to take into consideration

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.441 align:middle line:84%
that they are a
time-traveling species.

00:11:29.441 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So that is very important
to understand them.

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And also they appear
in different dimensions

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.250 align:middle line:90%
and in different realities.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.100 align:middle line:84%
They told me what has
happened is that they have

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.480 align:middle line:90%
three strains of Grey lines.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.190 align:middle line:90%
They call them--

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.280 align:middle line:84%
I will translate it
as master lines, which

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:58.490 align:middle line:84%
mean they have three parallel
Grey societies or Grey

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:03.620 align:middle line:84%
timelines that grew from
nonexistence, from probability

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:04.940 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And they knew outside
in a previous version

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.760 align:middle line:84%
of the universe,
which is not this one.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:84%
This one is integrated
in the previous one.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.450 align:middle line:84%
They knew that they would
experience a failed master

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:22.250 align:middle line:90%
line.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.810 align:middle line:84%
So one of the three master
lines needed to be shut down.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:34.385 align:middle line:84%
And their strategy was, well,
to accept that and then go on

00:12:34.385 --> 00:12:39.410 align:middle line:84%
on a successful master line
and get back and reach back

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.827 align:middle line:90%
to the first one and correct it

00:12:41.827 --> 00:12:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Brilliant.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: And help it out.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that gives them some
really great advantages

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.690 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: But they did destroy
one of those master lines to do

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.740 align:middle line:90%
that, right?

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: They did.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And that has-- let's say,
two-sided sword because it

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:10.610 align:middle line:84%
gives a species some
advantages as they are coming

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:15.610 align:middle line:84%
from a version of
the universe that

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:21.370 align:middle line:84%
has more-- a
different perspective

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and more and different
experiences than the one

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:24.880 align:middle line:90%
we have here.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:31.900 align:middle line:84%
But it also means that there is
a lot of turbulence and trauma

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.440 align:middle line:84%
inside of the Greys and
inside of the lineage

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:84%
that makes communication and
dealing with them sometimes

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:43.420 align:middle line:90%
challenging.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well, I'm sure
they threw it out of balance,

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.020 align:middle line:90%
for sure.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Yes, it's like
PTSD on a collective level.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:53.720 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: And let me add this
too because what I found pretty

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.870 align:middle line:84%
interesting is that the Greys
communicated and said that they

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.730 align:middle line:84%
think they are the
creators of humanity.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:12.180 align:middle line:84%
So to put it in some
kind of physical terms,

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:16.290 align:middle line:84%
they kind of created
this Fibonacci code

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:20.650 align:middle line:84%
in which you have a one which
duplicates to another one.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.650 align:middle line:90%
And then the code starts.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're thinking the way
they created this experience we

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.790 align:middle line:84%
now are experiencing
because as you already said,

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.470 align:middle line:90%
they are inter-dimensional.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.180 align:middle line:90%
They are inter-frequentional.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.240 align:middle line:84%
They are even a
time-traveling species.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.600 align:middle line:90%
So they appear everywhere.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's also
what they want to do

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and what their agenda
and endgame is.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: In all
their advancements,

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.910 align:middle line:84%
did you come across any
weaknesses that they had?

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I don't usually like
to think in terms of weaknesses

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:04.470 align:middle line:84%
because as we already agreed
on, that's nothing good or bad.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:08.430 align:middle line:84%
But what makes their
reality really challenging

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:84%
to themselves is that
in a previous version

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.410 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, they
have come to a dead end,

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:84%
which means that they reached
level 6 consciousness.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And they are really,
really mental species.

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So they experienced
the whole universe just

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.160 align:middle line:84%
as a intellectual
mental concept.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And as well, they
needed to reach out

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:41.640 align:middle line:84%
to one of their lineages and
lines in order to shut it down.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's inside
of their thinking.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And they need this experience
in order to heal themselves.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:55.040 align:middle line:84%
So one thing that could
happen and which has happened

00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and which is kind of
a pity in the way when

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:08.210 align:middle line:84%
we have conversation with them
is as they are very mental

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:84%
and also psychic evolved and
they oversee time lineages

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and timelines, they sometimes
realize thoughts, for example,

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.860 align:middle line:84%
of humans, which are not
accordingly to their behavior.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.270 align:middle line:84%
This is something very
special to humans.

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:84%
It's just the way the
system is structured,

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.200 align:middle line:84%
which has led them apart
from being cohesive

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.160 align:middle line:90%
with thoughts and actions.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:46.100 align:middle line:84%
A lot of humans act differently
in a behavior matter,

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.280 align:middle line:84%
but have all these kind
of different thoughts

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.780 align:middle line:90%
in their minds.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Like, you see a group of women
that are like, hey, Sarah, hi.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to see you.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.058 align:middle line:84%
But in their minds, they're
thinking, oh, I don't like her.

00:17:02.058 --> 00:17:03.350 align:middle line:90%
Look at her nails or something.

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Mm-hmm.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.109 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: And the
Greys realize that.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:07.490 align:middle line:90%
They see that.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.200 align:middle line:90%
They sense that.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And because they have reached
out to their own master line

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.810 align:middle line:84%
in order to shut
it down, they are

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.589 align:middle line:90%
pretty sensitive to betrayal.

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:24.530 align:middle line:90%
And they overreact to that.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And that is something to always
keep in mind when you're acting

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.730 align:middle line:90%
and interacting with a Grey.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How far back in
history do you know about

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.100 align:middle line:90%
the Greys?

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So as they are a
time-traveling species,

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.820 align:middle line:90%
they can go back and forth.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.950 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
happens when you're

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.550 align:middle line:84%
in level 4 consciousness,
when you realize that time

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.830 align:middle line:90%
is another kind of dimension.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:53.410 align:middle line:84%
That makes it
pretty easy for them

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.810 align:middle line:90%
to reach back into history.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:18:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And what they told me is that
even though they were not

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:08.200 align:middle line:84%
the builders of the Great
Pyramid in Giza, a lot of sites

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.100 align:middle line:84%
are oriented towards
the Orion star system.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And that is where they used to
have those bases and planetary

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:21.190 align:middle line:90%
systems where they evolved.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:26.830 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that there is
a long history of the Greys,

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:31.330 align:middle line:84%
probably thousands of years
reaching back in human time

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.030 align:middle line:84%
where they interacted
with the human species.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: In what way do
they influence humankind?

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: We know that we have
about 12 manipulative species

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.950 align:middle line:84%
that have influenced the
genetics of people on Earth

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.900 align:middle line:90%
in some way or another.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.950 align:middle line:90%
The Greys were one of them.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:54.400 align:middle line:84%
So obviously they have
influenced the genetics.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.770 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I found
pretty astonishing

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:02.650 align:middle line:84%
was that they think that they
are the fathers of mankind.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Besides that, we
find a lot of sites

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:12.920 align:middle line:84%
on this planet that are oriented
towards the Orion star system.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And one thing the Greys
have developed very strongly

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.960 align:middle line:84%
is a special kind of
economical system.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:28.130 align:middle line:84%
They have developed their
system towards the success

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:29.780 align:middle line:90%
of their evolution.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.900 align:middle line:84%
But we also find
that humans have

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:37.130 align:middle line:84%
this tendency towards trade
and towards economics.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And as you probably
know, a lot of sites

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.960 align:middle line:84%
on this planet like
the World Trade Center

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and some other economically
related buildings--

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:55.040 align:middle line:84%
they all are related to
the star system of Orion.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:90%
So that might give you a hint.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, the Greys
have this governmental system.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.810 align:middle line:90%
They have a hierarchy.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:90%
They have elite-based system.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is something we
also find on this planet.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Some people will say
that the Greys are biological

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.260 align:middle line:90%
androids.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.390 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: The puppets--

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.980 align:middle line:84%
so, the small Greys
that we're talking about

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.950 align:middle line:90%
and what people observe a lot.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Those are some kind of
fabricated material or bodies.

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:35.000 align:middle line:84%
They have those kind of
fibers that they put together

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.990 align:middle line:90%
to create them.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing is that

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.040 align:middle line:84%
every individual
consciousness unit

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.230 align:middle line:84%
inside of the
system of the Greys

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:50.600 align:middle line:84%
can use their credits that
they earn on missions to rent

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.680 align:middle line:90%
or to have one of those bodies.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And if one gets destroyed,
you can have another one.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly
enough, they're

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:02.570 align:middle line:84%
offering those bodies to, like,
everyone in the star system

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:90%
and in the universe.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:06.140 align:middle line:84%
You can have one if
you want, but then you

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.480 align:middle line:84%
get into a contract
with the Greys.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.815 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, I see.

00:21:09.815 --> 00:21:12.407 align:middle line:90%
Do they come with a warranty?

00:21:12.407 --> 00:21:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: That's a great question.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.680 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Maybe, I don't know.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Could you explain to
me how would you get a contract

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.890 align:middle line:90%
for those little guys?

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So in the universe, we
always have this triad model

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:31.640 align:middle line:84%
of a consciousness-- a
mind, a body, and a soul.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And the body does not have
to be a biological body.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:84%
It could also be
an artificial body.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Once the awareness, the
consciousness leaves the body,

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:50.600 align:middle line:84%
then you can easily
integrate soul and mind

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.180 align:middle line:90%
into another bodily form.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:56.300 align:middle line:84%
What the Greys do-- they
produce all these fiber

00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:01.520 align:middle line:84%
and superficial
bodies that they use.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And once you commit
yourself to the Grey system,

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.620 align:middle line:84%
you can, like,
order one of those.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:14.030 align:middle line:84%
They have this kind of
internet where they are all

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.840 align:middle line:90%
connected together.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And as well as soul and
mind gets integrated

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.370 align:middle line:90%
in this artificial body.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:26.360 align:middle line:84%
For example, you even
could have another puppet

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.920 align:middle line:90%
or another puppet.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.930 align:middle line:90%
So that you have three bodies.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:34.070 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness they have
and the capacity of their minds

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:38.665 align:middle line:84%
is so big that they can control
two or three of the puppets.

00:22:38.665 --> 00:22:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I heard also they
can send them out to do other

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:42.470 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:43.290 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: That is true.

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And you also can have
a craft for your own.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Yeah, which
is also connected

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.550 align:middle line:90%
to your consciousness.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And so you ask me
for a warranty.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:00.950 align:middle line:84%
If things break, then
they need to be replaced.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's the credit
you earn on missions for.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing
is that through that system,

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:19.710 align:middle line:84%
they preserve the possibility
to succeed in their timeline

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and in their evolution because
the greater the mission,

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.600 align:middle line:84%
the more credits the
individual earns.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And the more credits
the individual has,

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:36.570 align:middle line:84%
the more technology it can use,
the more successful it gets.

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:40.260 align:middle line:84%
It adds up on it until
we have one master line.

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And then they are so
powerful that they

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.980 align:middle line:84%
use this hierarchy to give it
down in a pyramid structure.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What is the current
involvement of the Greys

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.050 align:middle line:90%
on Earth?

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So I already told you
that they have their stocks

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:56.560 align:middle line:90%
inside of humanity.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.550 align:middle line:90%
They have hybrids here.

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:03.780 align:middle line:84%
They have people here
that are either now

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:08.430 align:middle line:84%
or in the future willing
to dedicate themselves

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:12.760 align:middle line:84%
for the overall
evolution of the world.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.610 align:middle line:90%
So that is important to them.

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:18.040 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say-- and
they made it pretty

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:25.930 align:middle line:84%
clearly that they do not have
an interest in the planet

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.660 align:middle line:90%
as a planet, as a life sphere.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:33.940 align:middle line:84%
They do not naturally care for
the population or something.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they touch
them or do them bad.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:43.400 align:middle line:84%
But if an individual
keeps their free will

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.810 align:middle line:84%
to become a failed
timeline, they

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:51.530 align:middle line:84%
will not step in and
prevent that because they

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.500 align:middle line:90%
have this empathy about them.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:25:01.280 align:middle line:84%
They have some stocks here, some
individuals and some things,

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.260 align:middle line:84%
some probabilities
where they know

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.680 align:middle line:84%
they need them to
succeed and to move

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.860 align:middle line:84%
the universe into a direction
where it harmoniously

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.000 align:middle line:90%
works out.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And once they did so, they
will also shift to level 7.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:17.300 align:middle line:84%
The master line will
shift to level 7.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And then one last
time, they will

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:23.540 align:middle line:90%
delete the other timelines.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You said
they have hybrids here.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:27.650 align:middle line:90%
Do they look fully human?

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:31.780 align:middle line:90%
And what's their objective here?

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Yeah, so what
I've read in pop culture--

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:39.030 align:middle line:84%
there's something which
is called a tall white.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And the tall
whites-- for example,

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:45.720 align:middle line:84%
they are one of the hybrids
the Greys put on Earth.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Why do they put them on
Earth is to get into contact

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:90%
with the Earth species.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So as I've said, there was some
turbulences before and too much

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.760 align:middle line:90%
outside influence.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So some higher
influential beings

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.110 align:middle line:84%
decided to put some
kind of ban on the Earth

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:08.280 align:middle line:84%
to keep outside forces
away from Earth.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And there were and there
are influential and invasive

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:18.330 align:middle line:84%
species that found their
way through them that--

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and the Greys did that
as well, for example,

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:27.090 align:middle line:84%
by creating hybrids,
these tall white beings.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:31.860 align:middle line:84%
They can have, for
example, a humanoid body,

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.670 align:middle line:84%
which is pretty similar
to an earthly body.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:41.310 align:middle line:84%
But they will have these typical
grayish heads, for example,

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:42.870 align:middle line:90%
with the large eyes.

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:45.660 align:middle line:84%
That could be a
hybrid of the Greys.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What's your opinion
based on your relationship with

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.230 align:middle line:90%
them?

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Media appearance and
the depiction of the Greys

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:53.650 align:middle line:90%
in mainstream media--

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:56.070 align:middle line:84%
this is one thing
because we all know

00:26:56.070 --> 00:27:00.960 align:middle line:84%
that there was a lot
of effort to put fear

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.370 align:middle line:84%
into the overall
non-terrestrial phenomenon.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:06.430 align:middle line:90%
This is one thing.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:07.710 align:middle line:90%
The other thing is--

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.300 align:middle line:90%
and yes, this is true.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.180 align:middle line:90%
They are an invasive species.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And they can be quite
tricky at some times.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Invasive doesn't mean
that they invade planets,

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:21.630 align:middle line:90%
and they made that pretty clear.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:30.680 align:middle line:84%
But they kind of step over
certain barriers and boundaries

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.280 align:middle line:84%
that at least human
people naturally feel.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:39.560 align:middle line:84%
But that also has to do with
the way they perceive time

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:44.300 align:middle line:84%
because see, they are a
time-traveling species.

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:48.470 align:middle line:84%
They respect the free
will because they need to.

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is one regulation
of the rules the Greys have,

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.020 align:middle line:90%
that they respect the free will.

00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:01.130 align:middle line:84%
If somebody repeatedly
says that they do not

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:04.880 align:middle line:84%
want to have something to do
with them, they respect that.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.360 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody on,
like, planet Earth

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:15.150 align:middle line:84%
is pretty important to them
or has a very high potential

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and probability to be
beneficial for them,

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.940 align:middle line:84%
they will kind of find
some way around that.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.400 align:middle line:84%
As they are a
time-traveling species,

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.550 align:middle line:84%
they can base their
decision to, for example,

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:35.010 align:middle line:84%
interact with somebody upon a
willing decision that somebody

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:90%
takes in 1,000 years.

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody is
dedicated to the Greys

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:45.490 align:middle line:84%
in another lifetime
and thousands of years,

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:48.430 align:middle line:84%
they can take that
as an act of free

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:53.680 align:middle line:84%
will in order to reach out
to them now, which of course,

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:59.110 align:middle line:84%
might create the timeline
that leads to the point

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:02.020 align:middle line:84%
where somebody interacts
with them willingly.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Interesting.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Some people think that they
are just us from the future.

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:09.680 align:middle line:90%
What's your thoughts on that?

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, I think that can
make sense in some kind of way

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:17.710 align:middle line:84%
because as they are a
time-traveling species and they

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:22.990 align:middle line:84%
are going back and forth inside
of the dimension of time,

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:30.420 align:middle line:84%
they in some kind are humans
in the future and other species

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.850 align:middle line:84%
as well because
they are collective,

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:36.480 align:middle line:90%
a superficial collective.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm quoting them when
I say that they kind of use

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:46.140 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids, which are directed
to the Orion star system,

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:53.220 align:middle line:84%
in order to have people from
the past lay into those chambers

00:29:53.220 --> 00:30:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and extract their consciousness
and their souls in order to A,

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.910 align:middle line:84%
have a connection
to Earth people,

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:07.500 align:middle line:84%
which is very important to
their rules because you cannot

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:11.490 align:middle line:84%
influence the system where do
not have some kind of genetics

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.590 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And B, have those
Earth people inside

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:22.590 align:middle line:84%
of the Grey system giving
them artificial bodies

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and having them
interact with the Earth

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.880 align:middle line:90%
and reaching back to them.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.720 align:middle line:84%
This is probably why
people are thinking

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:36.660 align:middle line:84%
that in some kind of way the
non-terrestrials from that time

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:40.350 align:middle line:90%
would come back in another time.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And maybe try
to fix that timeline.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Absolutely, yes.

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:47.808 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Or delete it.

00:30:47.808 --> 00:30:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: The ultimate way.

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they want
to come to a point

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:53.050 align:middle line:84%
where everything
else is obsolete,

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:57.070 align:middle line:84%
so we live in a harmonious
unified universe

00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:00.460 align:middle line:84%
where we do not need the
dualistic timeline anymore.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.470 align:middle line:90%
And they will reach out to that.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Many extraterrestrial
species are developed versions

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:12.680 align:middle line:84%
of animals that we
see here on Earth.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Do the Greys resemble
any known species?

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: If I had to find a life
form that resembles the Greys,

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:26.540 align:middle line:84%
the best I would say is a
virus or maybe even the patch.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:30.080 align:middle line:84%
If you think about a computer,
you put it into a patch

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:39.780 align:middle line:84%
in order to upgrade or update a
system without destructing it.

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So you're saying
that the patch, when put in--

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and this is just
hypothetically speaking--

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.100 align:middle line:84%
when that is put in to
a biological system,

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:54.960 align:middle line:84%
the entire species
gets to download.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, what we see
naturally is that the universe

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:03.420 align:middle line:84%
tends to go in cycles, which
if you're thinking about

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:07.110 align:middle line:84%
the Vedas, you have
this Shiva, Vishnu,

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:10.590 align:middle line:84%
and Brahma concept where
destruction is a part

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:11.610 align:middle line:90%
of everything.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:14.310 align:middle line:84%
But as we've
learned, destructing

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:18.120 align:middle line:84%
a timeline is something the
Greys already have experienced.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.230 align:middle line:90%
And they try to heal that.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:24.480 align:middle line:84%
So what they want to do is to
find a way to do it on the fly,

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:28.560 align:middle line:84%
to find a way to upgrade
the universe without it

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.790 align:middle line:84%
going in cycles and
re-destructing itself

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:36.510 align:middle line:84%
because that is when
the universe loses

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:42.050 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the memory it has
obtained in the first place.

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Amazing
information, Tim.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:49.037 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: It's a pleasure, Emery.

00:32:49.037 --> 00:32:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.040 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>> ANNOUNCER: Next on
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you believe the
Greys have manipulated our DNA?

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: I know they have.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:07.590 align:middle line:84%
They have taken a species
that they found appropriate

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:08.760 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And they have infused their
own genetics into that.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:16.290 align:middle line:84%
We know that there are
about 12 species that

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:22.430 align:middle line:84%
have influences on the
genetics of human life forms.

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:32.288 align:middle line:90%
