00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with Randy Cramer.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.020 align:middle line:10%
Randy shares with
us his experience

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.800 align:middle line:10%
in a secret space program
called Earth Defense Force.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Always happy to be here.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>> You talk about your
connection with ancient

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.550 align:middle line:84%
civilizations and the
Agarthan spaceports.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.630 align:middle line:84%
What are the
Agarthan spaceports?

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.150 align:middle line:84%
The Agarthan network is
the subterranean network

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.160 align:middle line:84%
of pockets of large
spaces and what we

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.410 align:middle line:90%
consider to be the honeycomb.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:84%
In the past, people
have referred

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.680 align:middle line:90%
to this as the hollow Earth.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not hollow.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:90%
It's honeycombed.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.970 align:middle line:84%
There are some
very large pockets,

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.880 align:middle line:84%
so large that if you
were standing inside one

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.600 align:middle line:84%
of these pockets, you wouldn't
be able to see to the far end

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.910 align:middle line:84%
to your right or to the
far end to your left.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And so you might
mistakenly think,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.730 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm in the inside of the
hollow planet, but you're not.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.040 align:middle line:84%
You're just in a
very large pocket.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.730 align:middle line:84%
The pockets are connected
by a series of tunnels.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Some of these tunnels are
very large, as big as a mile

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.440 align:middle line:84%
wide, in order for very
large ships to move through.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.600 align:middle line:84%
They connect pockets together,
connect to the surface.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And in many cases, the
connectors to the surface

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.870 align:middle line:84%
are old tunnels
that connect to many

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.040 align:middle line:84%
of the old ancient civilization
sites around the world

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.850 align:middle line:84%
that we're familiar with
like Egypt and Teotihuacan,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:84%
and Angkor Wat and
such places like that

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.780 align:middle line:84%
that still have the tunnel
systems, are still connected.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases,
these are still

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.570 align:middle line:84%
active import-export spaceports
for the species that still

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.340 align:middle line:90%
live in the Agarthan network.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Who these Agarthan beings?

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Where are they from?

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have a
few different species.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.250 align:middle line:84%
We have a native terrestrial
reptoid species that we often

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:90%
refer to as the raptor species.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.310 align:middle line:90%
They live down there.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.600 align:middle line:84%
We have a indigenous native
insectoid species, which

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.730 align:middle line:90%
we think of as ant people.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.180 align:middle line:90%
They live down there.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.050 align:middle line:90%
We also have species--

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.450 align:middle line:84%
some who are not
from here, but live

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.180 align:middle line:84%
and work there, but also the
ancient Lemurians, Atlanteans.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:84%
When some of them
went underground,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:84%
that's where some of
the beginning of some

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:84%
of Agarthan cities that we
think of is run by the Nordics--

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.900 align:middle line:84%
these tall, blondy,
blue-eyed folks

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.570 align:middle line:84%
who were originally
Lemurian Atlanteans,

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:90%
but went underground.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's a mixture of native
terrestrial species, mammalian,

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.130 align:middle line:84%
insectoid, reptoids, as well as
other extraterrestrial species

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.170 align:middle line:84%
who have either
been stationed here,

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.870 align:middle line:84%
or in some cases have
moved here to work here

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.950 align:middle line:84%
in some of those cities
for the same reasons

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.470 align:middle line:84%
that people travel to
other countries for jobs

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.860 align:middle line:84%
there as well, because they
want to go to another place

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and do a job there instead of
staying home where it's boring.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's a number
of species, most

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:84%
who are native
terrestrial-born species,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.780 align:middle line:84%
and a few
extraterrestrial species.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any buildings
or domiciles there?

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Or do they just
live in the ships?

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.520 align:middle line:84%
There are cities that
are massive where

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.030 align:middle line:84%
the populations can be in
the millions of personnel.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And they have, in some
cases, high-rise structures

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.230 align:middle line:84%
that are more built into
the rock of the planet.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.260 align:middle line:84%
So you might see a very
tall stalagmite that kind of

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:84%
connects the floor
to the ceiling that's

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.930 align:middle line:84%
peppered with small apartments,
or buildings with windows,

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:59.730 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.530 align:middle line:90%
And them they'll light up.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.470 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty interesting to see.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But some of them are
very largely populated

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.150 align:middle line:84%
and have a lot of very advanced
modern building structure

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.079 align:middle line:84%
that is blended into
this cavernous structure.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>> What about this city
under Egypt and the one under

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Antarctica?

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Are these also these
Agarthan sites?

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.760 align:middle line:84%
There was a major space
port right at the edge

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.530 align:middle line:90%
and underneath Antarctica.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:84%
My understanding-- there's
still a spaceport there, but not

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.720 align:middle line:90%
a very functional one.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.230 align:middle line:84%
But the one that
they've been uncovering

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.930 align:middle line:84%
through archaeological
digs in Antarctica

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.810 align:middle line:84%
is probably one of the
oldest known spaceports

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.070 align:middle line:90%
on planet Earth.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you mean
when you say spaceport?

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, an airport is a place
where airplanes fly in and out

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.800 align:middle line:84%
of on some regular,
scheduled, regulated place.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.400 align:middle line:84%
A spaceport is a place where
spaceships come in and out

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:84%
and are trafficked
on a regular basis.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.760 align:middle line:84%
So a spaceport is where
spaceships come in and out.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.735 align:middle line:84%
>> So do they have these
space towers to guide in the--

00:05:13.735 --> 00:05:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they don't need
towers, but they do have traffic

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.910 align:middle line:90%
control.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you were coming
in for a landing,

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.650 align:middle line:84%
you would have to communicate
with traffic control.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And they would tell you
what path to take to land.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Or if you were leaving,
they would tell you

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.500 align:middle line:84%
what path they would
request that you leave.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's organized,
controlled traffic.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So why is it, Randy,
that these craft are coming

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:84%
in and out of these spaceports,
yet they're not interfering

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.770 align:middle line:90%
with our air traffic?

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>> It's import-export,
people coming and going,

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.860 align:middle line:84%
goods and so forth
arriving and leaving.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's essentially-- they're
a port in the same way

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.820 align:middle line:84%
that we have other ports
that stuff comes in and out.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.490 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of that really has
to do with the traffic lanes.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.730 align:middle line:84%
So I live in Sedona where
there is a spaceport.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And I have friends who have
good military-grade night

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.360 align:middle line:90%
vision goggles.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.700 align:middle line:84%
When we stand outside
and look at the traffic

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.800 align:middle line:84%
lanes with the night
vision, you can

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.930 align:middle line:84%
see them going in
the east-west traffic

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.600 align:middle line:84%
lanes and the
north-south traffic lanes

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:84%
faster than one a
minute some nights.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:84%
I've stood there with
my neck staring up

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.990 align:middle line:84%
seeing more than
one ship a minute

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.778 align:middle line:84%
until my neck was so sore
that I had to stop looking.

00:06:27.778 --> 00:06:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So there could have been a
whole bunch more after that.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.490 align:middle line:84%
But I was like, oh, my neck's
sore, I can't keep looking.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And what we noticed
in the traffic

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.690 align:middle line:84%
lanes is that the ships
have to go up really,

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.600 align:middle line:84%
really high from the port before
they go into the traffic lane.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Or they have to come in really
high into the traffic lane

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:90%
and then come straight down.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.260 align:middle line:84%
It's rare-- although
I have seen it--

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.100 align:middle line:84%
where they come in low,
and fast, and at an angle

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.450 align:middle line:90%
like an airplane would.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Usually, it's because of a more
urgent need, or an emergency.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.610 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time,
the traffic lanes

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.750 align:middle line:84%
are simply at a
very high altitude.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So they have to come in very
high, and then straight down,

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.248 align:middle line:84%
and then straight
back up, and then back

00:07:09.248 --> 00:07:11.040 align:middle line:84%
into the very, very
high traffic lanes that

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.250 align:middle line:84%
are well over 30,000,
40,000 feet probably.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.170 align:middle line:84%
In the same way that
we have airports

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.220 align:middle line:84%
that pick traffic lanes so
that planes don't crash,

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.020 align:middle line:84%
they've picked a
set of traffic lanes

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.200 align:middle line:84%
that are outside the
normal FAA traffic lanes

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.320 align:middle line:84%
so that they don't
interact with aircraft.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I have seen some footage that
maybe you could validate for me

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:38.820 align:middle line:84%
of regular passenger jets
flying over these areas,

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and stopping in mid-air,
and lowering right down

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.390 align:middle line:90%
into the ground.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this some sort
of cloaking device?

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.490 align:middle line:84%
I've seen this
several times myself.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Again, in Sedona, there's a spot
that I go to on a regular bike

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.150 align:middle line:90%
ride that's up a hill.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And twice in the same week,
I saw the exact same thing

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.140 align:middle line:84%
happen, which was what looked
like a commercial aircraft

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.880 align:middle line:90%
coming across the sky.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.000 align:middle line:84%
But as I was looking at it,
my trained observer eyes--

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.800 align:middle line:84%
I was like, that color seems
a little too bright white.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm not seeing the
flashing FAA light.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm not seeing a contrail.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm not seeing any
evidence of jet propulsion

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.520 align:middle line:84%
in a clear, blue,
cloudless sky, and then

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:31.860 align:middle line:84%
watched the plane vanish into
thin air, just disappear.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this twice
in the same week.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:90%
I've seen this three times.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.929 align:middle line:84%
But I saw it twice
in the same week.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was following the
same exact traffic pattern.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.860 align:middle line:84%
It looked like the exact same
type of commercial airline.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that's a ship
using a cloaking device

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.560 align:middle line:84%
saying, I'm just an aircraft
here, nothing to see here.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.120 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's someone
using a hologram

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.760 align:middle line:84%
of what they think an
aircraft should look like

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.030 align:middle line:90%
and how it should behave.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.822 align:middle line:84%
So the minute that I
saw it the first time,

00:09:03.822 --> 00:09:06.170 align:middle line:84%
I was like, wait, that
doesn't look quite right.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:11.080 align:middle line:10%
So it's some form of a
cloaking, camouflage device--

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.180 align:middle line:10%
that's not used all the
time, obviously, because

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle line:10%
I've seen at high altitudes
just these little balls of light

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.640 align:middle line:10%
close down near the ground
within a couple hundred

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.420 align:middle line:10%
feed off the ground, less than
five miles from my house as I'm

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.540 align:middle line:10%
standing either in the front
driveway or in my backyard,

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.600 align:middle line:10%
seeing these bright,
bright, bright white,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.490 align:middle line:10%
shiny, egg-shaped vehicles
hovering or zooming in fast.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.970 align:middle line:10%
So depending on
exactly where they are

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.310 align:middle line:10%
depends on what you've see
and what it looks like.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.110 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.580 align:middle line:84%
The angle, I think, has a lot
to do with it, and whatever

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.660 align:middle line:90%
they're projecting.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Doing contact work in Blanca
Peak over in Crestone,

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.140 align:middle line:84%
we've seen helicopters
and small jets

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.900 align:middle line:84%
fly right into the
mountain and disappear.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Also in Shasta-- it happens
all the time when we're there.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and some of the
entrances are essentially

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:07.510 align:middle line:84%
holograms that look like
solid rock, but it's not.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you know the path
to fly straight in,

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.610 align:middle line:84%
you can just fly
straight through

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and look like you're going
right into solid rock.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.170 align:middle line:84%
But you're not, because
it's just a hologram.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>> No explosion.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>> No, just disappear.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.532 align:middle line:84%
>> So they're just flying around
amongst us in our own vehicles.

00:10:23.532 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Or at least what look
like our own vehicles.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.045 align:middle line:84%
>> Look kind of-- their
rendition of our own vehicles.

00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:28.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:28.845 --> 00:10:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's what an alien thinks
a helicopter or an airplane

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.710 align:middle line:84%
looks like and
should behave like.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, aside from
contact with the Agarthans,

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.460 align:middle line:84%
what about the
Earth Defense Force?

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Are they within the
Earth Defense Force?

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Is that part of the same team?

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Who else is in
contact with them?

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we certainly have
a positive relationship with

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.070 align:middle line:90%
the Agarthans.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.790 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that, if we needed

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.030 align:middle line:84%
to use one of these spaceports
for an emergency landing

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.880 align:middle line:84%
or we were having a
meeting somewhere,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.487 align:middle line:84%
we would use these spaceports
like anyone else uses them.

00:11:03.487 --> 00:11:05.070 align:middle line:84%
We would go through
the traffic lanes,

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.110 align:middle line:84%
and go through traffic
control, and land

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.050 align:middle line:84%
where we got told to land
so that we could participate

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.090 align:middle line:84%
in a meeting or a
conversation with someone.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Or if we were sending people
down into the Agartha,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.410 align:middle line:90%
that's the way that we would go.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.390 align:middle line:84%
We would go through
the port so that we

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.490 align:middle line:84%
would connect to the tunnel
system and then fly on down.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.700 align:middle line:84%
So we use these
spaceports as well.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And correct me if I'm
wrong, but don't some of these

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:32.130 align:middle line:84%
spaceports have
portal technology?

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.580 align:middle line:90%
Some of them certainly do.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Mostly what occurs, though,
is that the portal technology

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.580 align:middle line:90%
isn't inside the spaceport.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.730 align:middle line:84%
It's something for
safety reasons.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.220 align:middle line:90%
You deploy outside of the port.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:51.990 align:middle line:84%
So in some cases, you can see
ships in the traffic lanes,

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.910 align:middle line:84%
bright light going
on, and then just

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.770 align:middle line:84%
disappears, which I imagine is
when they're hitting a portal.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.207 align:middle line:84%
And you just don't
see them anymore

00:12:01.207 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:84%
because they've gone
through a portal.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.623 align:middle line:84%
But usually, they're
at very high altitudes,

00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:84%
so it's hard to see
without the night vision.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel there'll
be more open contact

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.430 align:middle line:90%
with Agarthans and humans?

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And from your experience,
what will that look like?

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd say it's an
inevitability at some point.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.230 align:middle line:84%
But I would also suggest it's
going to be fairly restricted.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.020 align:middle line:84%
So you're not just going to
be able to go to the spaceport

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.187 align:middle line:90%
because you want to.

00:12:26.187 --> 00:12:28.770 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to have a
special passport that gives you

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:33.360 align:middle line:84%
permission to go and use that
spaceport, or get a vehicle,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.350 align:middle line:84%
or buy a ticket to
go from one place

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:38.770 align:middle line:90%
to another via that spaceport.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So I would imagine,
just like it is now,

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.390 align:middle line:84%
that access is restricted
to certain personnel who

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.460 align:middle line:90%
have a special travel passport.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.640 align:middle line:90%
They can use that.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And as we get through the travel
embargo, information embargo,

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:55.362 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, that will
widen up a little bit.

00:12:55.362 --> 00:12:56.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's not
something that's going

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.510 align:middle line:84%
to be readily available to the
general public for some time,

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:90%
probably.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.548 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably
because the Agarthans

00:13:03.548 --> 00:13:04.590 align:middle line:90%
would prefer it that way.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:07.230 align:middle line:84%
They probably don't
want a bunch of Terrans

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:84%
running around their spaceports
with their screaming children.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Are the Agarthans and Terrans
living together down there?

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Are they amicable?

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Are there certain special humans
that are allowed to do this?

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that we have some
personnel who are assigned

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.060 align:middle line:84%
to some of these places
as liaison officers,

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.260 align:middle line:90%
as liaison personnel.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:84%
So we do know that some
Terrans do live in these spaces

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:90%
and work in these spaces.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.840 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a lot.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a fairly small number.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there some sort
of governing body there?

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And is there a
special police force?

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>> The Agarthan Network--

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:50.790 align:middle line:84%
that's what it's called-- is
the collective governing body

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.190 align:middle line:84%
of the number of species
that work together.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And they have some
territory that may

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.090 align:middle line:90%
be more one group or another.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.640 align:middle line:84%
The Raptors-- I'm
to understand it's

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.400 align:middle line:84%
ill-advised to wander
into their territory

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.730 align:middle line:84%
without permission, or
without proper escorts,

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.380 align:middle line:84%
or going through
the right channels.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.840 align:middle line:84%
For the most part,
they cooperate,

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.860 align:middle line:84%
follow a system of rules and
laws that they all agree upon,

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.990 align:middle line:90%
and cooperate.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And there are sworn law
enforcement who are--

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:27.000 align:middle line:84%
it's to their job to
investigate, and detain,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and arrest or terminate in the
line of duty anyone or anything

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.180 align:middle line:84%
that is determined to
be violating the law.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>> They were connected to us
in the ancient civilizations.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Where did this
disconnect happen?

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as the fall of some of
these civilizations occurred,

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:47.130 align:middle line:84%
as some of the extraterrestrial
species who were managing these

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:52.110 align:middle line:84%
civilizations or participating
in these civilizations left,

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:56.110 align:middle line:84%
the Terrans who were there
had a choice in some cases,

00:14:56.110 --> 00:15:00.180 align:middle line:84%
which was to try and manage
these civilized locations

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:03.780 align:middle line:84%
on their own or to take
the personnel, material,

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.610 align:middle line:84%
and technology that they could
and go somewhere that was

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:07.410 align:middle line:90%
safer.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest, for
many of them, managing

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:14.610 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of uneducated
terrestrial surface dwellers

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.500 align:middle line:90%
was really unappealing.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So they would rather get
to a safe, secure location

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.270 align:middle line:90%
in an underground spot.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And then that was when the
division between the Agarthans

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and the surface dwellers
became, whatever you guys do up

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.160 align:middle line:84%
there is what you guys do up
there, whatever we do down here

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.230 align:middle line:84%
is what we do down
here, and we're just

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:38.070 align:middle line:84%
not going to care too much
about what you guys do up there.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:43.860 align:middle line:84%
So they still care in the
sense that the well-being

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.480 align:middle line:90%
of the planet does matter.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And they're not exactly
thrilled with the way

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:49.320 align:middle line:84%
that we've managed
things up here.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.960 align:middle line:84%
But there's been a
long-standing agreement--

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.840 align:middle line:84%
we get to manage the
surface world up here,

00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:00.060 align:middle line:84%
and they're managing the under
Agarthan world down there.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And they really don't want to
come up here and take control

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.400 align:middle line:90%
or manage this mess.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:10.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like asking one
kindergarten teacher

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.540 align:middle line:84%
whether or not they
want to go into a school

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:84%
where there are no
teachers, and there

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:19.215 align:middle line:84%
are just toddlers running around
crazy like "Lord of the Flies"

00:16:19.215 --> 00:16:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, would
you like to go in there

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.870 align:middle line:84%
and take over that school
and manage that mess?

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Most of those
kindergarten teachers

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:30.060 align:middle line:84%
are going to look at that
and go, no, I have no desire

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.720 align:middle line:90%
to take over that mess.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.120 align:middle line:90%
It's similar.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.620 align:middle line:84%
As far as they're
concerned, there's

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.550 align:middle line:84%
way too many crazy young
toddlers up here screaming.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Why in the world would
they want to come up

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:84%
here and try and take control
of that and manage that?

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.730 align:middle line:90%
That's a nightmare.

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And also, the technology--
why aren't they sharing any

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.248 align:middle line:90%
of that technology with us?

00:16:49.248 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's been a
long-standing agreement to keep

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.950 align:middle line:90%
it separate.

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.750 align:middle line:84%
But I would suggest
that there has

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.940 align:middle line:90%
been communication over time.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.980 align:middle line:84%
There has been some
technology sharing over time.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.620 align:middle line:90%
But it's the trickle.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.300 align:middle line:84%
In some ways,
there's similar ways

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.210 align:middle line:84%
in which extraterrestrials from
outside have been interacting.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:07.230 align:middle line:90%
There's interaction.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.490 align:middle line:90%
There's communication.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.680 align:middle line:84%
There's technological
dissemination.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.970 align:middle line:90%
It's just a trickle.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And for the audience,
on a scalability factor,

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:19.619 align:middle line:84%
how deep are we talking that
these cities are inside inner

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:20.520 align:middle line:90%
Earth?

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd say most of them
are between 3 and 10,

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.119 align:middle line:90%
15 miles deep.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>> And I had heard also--

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:29.960 align:middle line:90%
maybe you can verify this--

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.710 align:middle line:84%
that there were a few
incidents of drilling,

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and also our human population
drilling and making tunnels,

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and one time accidentally
went into one of these cities.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:52.040 align:middle line:84%
That happened once
back in the 1960s.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And that was probably
when the Agarthans

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:56.510 align:middle line:84%
decided that they
were going to have

00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:01.160 align:middle line:84%
to have a serious conversation
with the terrestrial surface

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:01.960 align:middle line:90%
dwelling military--

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's when that
ambassadorship program started

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:04.990 align:middle line:90%
happening, I think.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think in real earnest,
where they were like, OK,

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.930 align:middle line:84%
you dug a hole somewhere where
you weren't supposed to dig it.

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:13.520 align:middle line:90%
And you caused a ruckus.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.950 align:middle line:84%
So I guess we're going
to have to map out

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:19.460 align:middle line:84%
for you where to avoid, what
depths that you can dig at.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.560 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
start making tunnels,

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.190 align:middle line:84%
then we need to let you
know where not to dig.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So there had to be
some conversation where

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.385 align:middle line:84%
we could develop
some system of trust

00:18:29.385 --> 00:18:31.760 align:middle line:84%
so that they could tell us,
great, now that you trust us,

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.948 align:middle line:84%
will you please not dig
here, here, here, and here,

00:18:33.948 --> 00:18:35.240 align:middle line:90%
or tunnel here, here, and here?

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't, we'll help
you build a tunnel and a train

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:84%
system for you to connect
your underground bases with.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So there was some cooperation
at that point for them

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.990 align:middle line:84%
to help us dig that
tunnel system that

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.700 align:middle line:84%
connects the underground
bases for us,

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.200 align:middle line:84%
because they were
really good at it.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And that way, it kept us from
digging into their tunnels,

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and digging into their
cities, and so forth.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to create
separate infrastructure

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.370 align:middle line:84%
by establishing
some communication

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.720 align:middle line:90%
and level of trust.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thanks for
verifying that, Randy.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:08.320 align:middle line:84%
I've been wondering about
that for a very long time.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Randy, I have heard that there's
some connection between the men

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.750 align:middle line:90%
in black and the Agarthans.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.650 align:middle line:90%
Do you know anything about this?

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are a couple of
canyons in the Sedona area.

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:24.670 align:middle line:84%
It would be best if
I don't mention them

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:28.480 align:middle line:84%
just so that a bunch of people
don't flood these areas looking

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.470 align:middle line:90%
for stuff.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:32.440 align:middle line:84%
But for the locals,
it's fairly well

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.160 align:middle line:84%
know where I'm talking
about where, depending

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.120 align:middle line:84%
on what time of day and what
day of the week that you go

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.750 align:middle line:84%
to visit one of these areas,
you might find yourself getting

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:48.370 align:middle line:84%
visited by men in black suits
in a black car that, according

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.130 align:middle line:84%
to several eyewitnesses
that I've spoken to,

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:54.910 align:middle line:84%
can pop out of nowhere,
meaning you might be looking

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:58.090 align:middle line:84%
to this direction, do a
360, turn back around,

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden there's
a car and two guys standing

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.437 align:middle line:84%
outside the car
who will tell you

00:20:02.437 --> 00:20:04.270 align:middle line:84%
that you need to leave
the area and that you

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.820 align:middle line:90%
need to shuffle along.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:84%
These are people who fit this
classic men-in-black profile.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.470 align:middle line:84%
They're driving a car, a
black sedan from the '50s.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:19.840 align:middle line:84%
They're wearing
suits from the '50s.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:24.150 align:middle line:84%
They're wearing hats that
are mid-20th century.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Skin's pasty, eyebrows
aren't quite right,

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.670 align:middle line:90%
if they have eyebrows.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Ears aren't quite right, if
they have earlobes at all.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Lips aren't quite
right, sunglasses so you

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.440 align:middle line:90%
can't see their eyeballs.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.450 align:middle line:84%
So they're a different
species, for sure.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And their job is
to manage security

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.850 align:middle line:90%
around some of these places.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you're somewhere
where you're not

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.200 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be, they might
pop out and tell you,

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.540 align:middle line:84%
you need to move along, and
shuffle along out of here.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Have you experienced this?

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Not yet.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.680 align:middle line:84%
I haven't lived
there long enough.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.427 align:middle line:84%
I keep asking everybody
who I've known

00:20:58.427 --> 00:21:00.510 align:middle line:84%
who have seen these things
to give me all the data

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and information about
exact locations, time,

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.290 align:middle line:84%
dates so that I
can attempt to go

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:09.210 align:middle line:84%
to these places
at the right time

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:11.040 align:middle line:90%
and hopefully run into someone.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they weaponized?

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>> They're supposed to have
a sidearm of some kind under

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.120 align:middle line:84%
the jacket, but I don't know
anybody who's ever had one

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:19.920 align:middle line:90%
drawn on them.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know
what they're using

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.120 align:middle line:90%
or what their service weapon is.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think this
race of humans--

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.730 align:middle line:90%
or clones, it sounds like.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Something.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>> What about that vehicle?

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that's a
transdimensional vehicle?

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:42.610 align:middle line:84%
A number of eyewitnesses
have seen both the personnel

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.520 align:middle line:84%
and the vehicle
appear and disappear

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.900 align:middle line:84%
without hearing an engine sound
or without seeing the vehicle

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.210 align:middle line:90%
drive away or arrive.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:55.570 align:middle line:84%
So in many cases, the
vehicle is just there.

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.240 align:middle line:90%
The men in black are just there.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And then, they're
just not there.

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.290 align:middle line:84%
So I would say it's
safe to speculate

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:04.720 align:middle line:84%
we're not talking
about a regular Caddy

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.010 align:middle line:90%
from the 19th, 20th century.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:06.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:06.355 --> 00:22:07.155 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:07.155 --> 00:22:08.570 align:middle line:90%
How about any Deloreans?

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Not that I know of.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned, in Sedona,
these craft up in the sky.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.160 align:middle line:84%
You even said some of them
were just hovering there.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.890 align:middle line:84%
How high were these craft
from where you were standing?

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And where else on the
planet are these ports

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:31.540 align:middle line:84%
where people are claiming to
see the same things that you're

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.870 align:middle line:90%
seeing?

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you're watching
the traffic lanes,

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:39.130 align:middle line:84%
I would guess from the size of
the light that you're looking

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.730 align:middle line:84%
at or the vehicle that you're
looking at, they can be as high

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:84%
as 40,000, 50,000 feet in
some cases-- very high up.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.320 align:middle line:10%
I, however, have seen them
down close to the ground,

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.430 align:middle line:10%
not more than 100 or a couple
feet off of the ground.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:59.390 align:middle line:84%
So I've seen them go
behind a rock structure

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:03.670 align:middle line:84%
so they're low enough to be only
several feet off of the valley

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.410 align:middle line:90%
floor, wherever they may be.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:10.870 align:middle line:84%
I've seen them behind my
house less than a mile away.

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:14.440 align:middle line:84%
I've seen them in front of the
house, maybe a mile and a half

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:18.850 align:middle line:84%
away, hovering low
over the ground.

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:23.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure why,
sometimes, that happens.

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.870 align:middle line:84%
When I see them outside
the normal traffic lanes,

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:28.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm not always sure why they're
outside the normal traffic

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.270 align:middle line:84%
lanes, because it is more
anomalous to see them

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:34.360 align:middle line:84%
outside the traffic lanes
than in the traffic lanes.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.280 align:middle line:90%
But it does happen.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.220 align:middle line:84%
The one that flew right
behind the house--

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.410 align:middle line:84%
there's this little place
called Jacks Canyon.

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:46.330 align:middle line:84%
It's maybe three, four
miles by three, four miles.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:52.550 align:middle line:84%
They came flying over the
canyon in less than two seconds,

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:53.470 align:middle line:90%
second and a half.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:57.130 align:middle line:84%
So it was going thousands
of miles an hour

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:00.670 align:middle line:84%
following a low
trajectory that was headed

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.400 align:middle line:84%
straight for this
rock formation,

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.900 align:middle line:84%
again, at the edge
of the canyon.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:90%
I was expecting it to crash.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I was expecting to hear an
explosion, because there

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:11.650 align:middle line:90%
was this plasma fire around it.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:14.630 align:middle line:84%
It was close enough that you
could see the flames whipping

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:15.430 align:middle line:90%
around the vehicle.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:16.870 align:middle line:90%
That's how close it was.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was expecting
to hear something.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.440 align:middle line:90%
I didn't hear anything.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.980 align:middle line:84%
So it must have flown
right in to the rock,

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.930 align:middle line:84%
right in through one
of these openings.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, maybe
15 minutes later--

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:33.190 align:middle line:84%
exact same size light,
exact same trajectory

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:37.570 align:middle line:84%
going the opposite direction,
same height, same distance.

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:39.260 align:middle line:90%
It shot out the other way.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.520 align:middle line:84%
So I was told that that's
where the medical center is.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'm presuming that
someone was zipping in

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.967 align:middle line:90%
for a medical emergency.

00:24:46.967 --> 00:24:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is right
in your backyard.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, within two
miles of my house.

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, literally
in my backyard.

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Definitely have to set
some cameras up there.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I am at the point
where I want to set--

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>> --cameras up around the
whole house pointing at all

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.670 align:middle line:84%
the directions of the sky,
because most of the time,

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.820 align:middle line:84%
these things go so fast I
don't have time to pull out

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.200 align:middle line:90%
my camera.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.650 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't have a GoPro
on my head at the time,

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:12.680 align:middle line:90%
you'd miss it.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.333 align:middle line:84%
So right now, I'm looking into,
OK, how many cameras do I need?

00:25:16.333 --> 00:25:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Can I put one on a pole
here, and a pole here,

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.500 align:middle line:84%
and have them all pointing
out in the directions

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:21.300 align:middle line:90%
from the house?

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Because depending on the day
or night and the direction

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking, I see them
all the time, all the time.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And what about these
other sites around the world?

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So some of them follow in
line with ancient civilization

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:38.590 align:middle line:84%
sites like Angkor Wat, and
Teotihuacan, and Cairo.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:42.250 align:middle line:84%
But you also have
some that follow

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:45.880 align:middle line:84%
some of the more recent
transplanted locations, again

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:51.190 align:middle line:84%
of Atlanteans like Mount
Shasta, Haleakala in Hawaii.

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Sedona is a very, very old city,
a long, long, long time ago,

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm told.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.940 align:middle line:84%
We're talking over
100,000 years ago.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.700 align:middle line:84%
For anyone who's been there
and looks at the formations,

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.430 align:middle line:84%
it's very clear from some
of the rock formations

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:10.270 align:middle line:84%
that they're not natural
formations at all, that they

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:14.740 align:middle line:84%
are eroded formations--
or, in some cases, things

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.890 align:middle line:84%
that look like they've
been blown apart or melted.

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:22.535 align:middle line:84%
But you can see the uniformity,
and the squared angles--

00:26:22.535 --> 00:26:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>> The angles, right.

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>> --and the flat
tops in some places.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Knowing a little bit about how
geological formations form,

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I've looked around town
enough at these formations

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.410 align:middle line:84%
going, that's not natural,
that's not natural,

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:41.928 align:middle line:84%
that might be natural,
that's totally not natural.

00:26:41.928 --> 00:26:43.720 align:middle line:84%
So anyone who knows
what they're looking at

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.630 align:middle line:84%
can see that you're
looking at things that

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.310 align:middle line:90%
used to be other structures.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:51.460 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple of pyramid
shapes, Ziggurat shapes.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at it
from a certain angle,

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:57.220 align:middle line:84%
you can see it's just
this size with a flat here

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.210 align:middle line:90%
and a flat there--

00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:59.543 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you can't make that up.

00:26:59.543 --> 00:27:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>> --things that just don't
naturally form that way,

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:07.690 align:middle line:84%
especially that many times in
that short of a area of square

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:08.600 align:middle line:90%
miles.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:84%
So some of them
follow, like I said,

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.490 align:middle line:90%
ancient civilization sites.

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Some of them follow
even older sites

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.770 align:middle line:84%
that people aren't aware,
ancient civilization sites.

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Or they're transplanted, dormant
volcanoes with empty cinder

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:27.310 align:middle line:84%
cones that people moved into
like Mount Shasta, Haleakala,

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and a couple other places
in the Rocky Mountains.

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>> How much more advanced
technologically are they than

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:34.270 align:middle line:90%
us?

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.687 align:middle line:84%
>> That's an
interesting question.

00:27:35.687 --> 00:27:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I would say, if you asked
that question 40 years ago,

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.990 align:middle line:84%
the answer would
be that they were

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:43.930 align:middle line:84%
quite a bit more technologically
advanced than we are.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.810 align:middle line:84%
But asking that
question now, I would

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:50.890 align:middle line:84%
say that it's not so much that
they are more technologically

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:54.610 align:middle line:84%
advanced so much as they're
more technologically

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:56.780 align:middle line:90%
practiced at certain things.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.920 align:middle line:84%
So some of the things they
have aren't necessarily more

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.220 align:middle line:84%
advanced, just things that
they've had for longer.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.610 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they've perfected
a little bit better.

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:10.780 align:middle line:84%
But we're catching up to
a lot of our neighbors

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.810 align:middle line:84%
here and elsewhere in the
intergalactic community

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:17.530 align:middle line:84%
as we grow and advance
in our understanding

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:20.740 align:middle line:84%
of the technological abilities
that the other species have.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.110 align:middle line:84%
We're catching up
really quickly.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating, Randy.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.085 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for sharing that with us.

00:28:26.085 --> 00:28:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for
being on the show.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>> My pleasure.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.810 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.
