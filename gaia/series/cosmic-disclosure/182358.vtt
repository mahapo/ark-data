>>GEORGE NOORY: Jules
Verne once wrote

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.690 align:middle line:10%
an extraordinary
story called "Journey

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.317 align:middle line:10%
to the Center of the Earth."

00:00:25.317 --> 00:00:27.361 align:middle line:84%
It explored, of
course, an encounter

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:30.656 align:middle line:84%
of prehistoric plants
inside of every vast cavern

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:32.531 align:middle line:90%
within the planet.

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:35.535 align:middle line:84%
With us today is Emery
Smith, who has personally

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:39.665 align:middle line:84%
encountered exotic flora on
his own extraterrestrial and

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:41.375 align:middle line:90%
inner-terrestrial adventures.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:43.043 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome to the program.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.878 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.923 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: This has got to be
an amazing adventure for you,

00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:51.385 align:middle line:84%
to go inside the inner
Earth and then witness

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:57.432 align:middle line:84%
vegetation, plants, animals that
you don't see anyplace else.

00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:59.309 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it's
quite amazing, especially

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.479 align:middle line:10%
all of the different
diverse species of plants

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.608 align:middle line:10%
that you would not normally
see on top of the Earth.

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:09.736 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole new
ecosystem down there.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.531 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking at different
types of minerals and chemicals

00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:15.284 align:middle line:84%
that are down there
that will spawn

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:19.830 align:middle line:84%
different types of plants and
funguses and things like this.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.749 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are there trees and
vegetation and grass and things

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:23.542 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:01:23.542 --> 00:01:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, there's
complete forests down there

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.675 align:middle line:84%
and many different types of
plants and vines and even

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:34.720 align:middle line:90%
seaweed and things like this.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.847 align:middle line:84%
We always have to be
very careful, though,

00:01:36.847 --> 00:01:38.056 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of these things.

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You're not a botanist.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.977 align:middle line:84%
But was one of your
missions to try

00:01:41.977 --> 00:01:44.771 align:middle line:84%
to explore the
kinds of vegetation

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:45.939 align:middle line:90%
and the different kinds?

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.024 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, exactly.

00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:50.319 align:middle line:84%
I was part of a team
of about 15 people.

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:56.908 align:middle line:84%
And we had experienced
very amazing adventures

00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:59.870 align:middle line:90%
that were also very dangerous.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.165 align:middle line:84%
Some of the plant life
there were carnivorous.

00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:05.417 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Like a Venus
flytrap, but bigger?

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:08.086 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, a lot bigger.

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:08.961 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, really?

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:09.755 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:12.257 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Rather than eat
flies, what do they eat?

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:14.009 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there's
animals down there.

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:15.469 align:middle line:90%
And they eat each other as well.

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:16.511 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You saw this?

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:17.304 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:19.097 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
amazing experiences

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:25.603 align:middle line:84%
that I ever had on one of
these missions was this plant.

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:28.565 align:middle line:84%
And it had a very
beautiful center.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: How big was the plant?

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.443 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It looked like--
oh, it was probably

00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:32.819 align:middle line:90%
about 15 feet in diameter.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.154 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: 15 feet?

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.113 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:38.283 align:middle line:84%
But it looked like those
agave plants, with the spikes.

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:39.076 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:39.493 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: You know?

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:40.535 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: They're pretty.

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:42.162 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And then
a real pretty pink

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.956 align:middle line:84%
or a purple flower in the
middle, like a lotus flower.

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:46.541 align:middle line:84%
What you don't
understand is those

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:51.713 align:middle line:84%
spikes are actually
tentacles, like on an octopus,

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.799 align:middle line:90%
that can reach out to 50 feet--

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.008 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And grab something?

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:55.841 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And grab you.

00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:56.718 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: No.

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.303 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:01.932 align:middle line:84%
And we had one of our
botanists get too close.

00:03:01.932 --> 00:03:04.101 align:middle line:90%
And these plants are spread out.

00:03:04.101 --> 00:03:07.604 align:middle line:84%
They're, like, a line,
saying, this is my territory.

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:08.563 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Gosh.

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So one of our botanists
was just standing there.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.904 align:middle line:84%
And it just snapped
over, grabbed her legs,

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:17.697 align:middle line:90%
and sucked her right in.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:18.824 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It pulled her in?

00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:19.116 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:20.784 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Were you
able to pull her out?

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, we were able to
immediately cut the limb off.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.454 align:middle line:84%
The plant was so smart
because it has it,

00:03:25.454 --> 00:03:29.918 align:middle line:84%
like, motion sensors built
into it, not mechanical,

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:33.213 align:middle line:84%
OK, that these other limbs
started to attack everyone.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.131 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, my gosh.

00:03:34.131 --> 00:03:36.299 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So it turned into
a bloodbath basically.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.801 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did anybody
die from this?

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:39.845 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No one died.

00:03:39.845 --> 00:03:43.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't think-- the center of
this had some sort of liquid

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.016 align:middle line:90%
in it, so--

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:46.268 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Like an acid liquid?

00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:47.477 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: We measured it.

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:52.065 align:middle line:84%
And later on, we found
out it was very acidic.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.234 align:middle line:84%
It would probably take
a long time to digest.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.445 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It literally
dissolves you away.

00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:57.237 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.989 align:middle line:90%
It would dissolve everything.

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.575 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a
very scary moment.

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:02.367 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:04.119 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, my gosh.

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:07.831 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And this is where
some of the canine units

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:12.377 align:middle line:84%
came in and were
helping us do this.

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:15.464 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
big machetes with us.

00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:19.176 align:middle line:84%
We have very small, you
know, eight-inch knives.

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:21.845 align:middle line:84%
And the tentacles on
these things were like--

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:22.971 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Like tree stumps.

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:25.599 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, like eight
inches, 12 inches thick.

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:26.933 align:middle line:90%
And they go into--

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.895 align:middle line:84%
they taper down into
a smaller thing.

00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:31.313 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: As the longer it gets.

00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right, right.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:90%
But they can go up to 50 feet--

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.524 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: My gosh.

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.026 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --and snatch you.

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:38.695 align:middle line:84%
So this poor woman,
screaming bloody murder.

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And all the alarms
go off in our suits.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.744 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we know
exactly where this person is.

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:49.623 align:middle line:84%
And by the time we get
over there, it already had,

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:54.628 align:middle line:84%
like, a python wraps
around your body,

00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:56.546 align:middle line:84%
it already had
wrapped all the way up

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:58.256 align:middle line:84%
to almost her
waist by that time.

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:00.008 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Was it squeezing her?

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it
was squeezing her.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.677 align:middle line:90%
But it got her.

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:06.181 align:middle line:84%
She told us it got her
by her one ankle first.

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.307 align:middle line:90%
So imagine standing there--

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:08.683 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And you
get tripped up.

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:10.143 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You're
over here working

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:14.231 align:middle line:84%
on taking a sample of a plant,
and someone just snatches you.

00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:15.482 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And pulls you along.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.317 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And pulls you along.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:21.112 align:middle line:84%
And now you're going towards
this giant monster plant.

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:23.198 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Was she
sucked into the plant?

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:24.241 align:middle line:90%
Does she remember that?

00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:25.158 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, no, no.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.994 align:middle line:84%
We got there in time
where it was still, like,

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.997 align:middle line:84%
coiling around it and
slowly retracting.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.707 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
other amazing thing.

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:37.254 align:middle line:84%
Because these things were
only six or eight feet tall,

00:05:37.254 --> 00:05:38.421 align:middle line:90%
the actual stem.

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:39.214 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: But 15 feet wide.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.425 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: But it can extend.

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:43.843 align:middle line:90%
It can actually extend.

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:46.179 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is that how
it eats, basically?

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.764 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's how it eats.

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:49.266 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It grabs animals.

00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It grabs animals,
grabs whatever walks by.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And then dissolves
them and then draws them

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.895 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:55.981 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And then slowly
dissolves them, you know,

00:05:55.981 --> 00:05:57.941 align:middle line:90%
in the center of this, of this--

00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:01.236 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How do we know that
it wasn't an animal as opposed

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:02.445 align:middle line:90%
to a plant?

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:05.532 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, we took so many
samples of that plant that day.

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:09.619 align:middle line:84%
We dug the whole thing up and
brought it all back with us.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And later on, we were
privy to the information--

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:21.214 align:middle line:84%
because this was a first time
for this, for us to experience.

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:24.092 align:middle line:84%
This plant was not
ever documented

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:26.219 align:middle line:90%
on any other missions.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.054 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And who would
know, walking by it?

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:31.933 align:middle line:84%
You probably look at it and
go, oh, what a gorgeous plant.

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:32.726 align:middle line:90%
In you go.

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:33.935 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And then that's it.

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:36.438 align:middle line:84%
And thank goodness, we
had the special equipment,

00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:40.108 align:middle line:84%
and everyone there, you
know, was so professional

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:42.235 align:middle line:90%
and reacted so quickly.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:45.447 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Were there plants like
this all over the inner Earth?

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:48.908 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, no, just in
this one pocket of the Earth.

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:50.869 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Were there
normal looking plants too?

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.704 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But there is
a lot of them around.

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:54.331 align:middle line:84%
So it was like a
field of these things.

00:06:54.331 --> 00:06:55.915 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Of this,
this kind of plant.

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:59.419 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Of this specific plant
on the outside of the forest.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:04.257 align:middle line:84%
You know how you see the
land in the salt flats, where

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.801 align:middle line:90%
it's, like, crackly, you know?

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:09.888 align:middle line:84%
So it was growing out of this,
this type of environment.

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:11.431 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And they're
over the place.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:14.184 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they're only
on the outside of the forest.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:16.561 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to walk through
this little desert here--

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:17.729 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Oh, you'd
get attacked, right?

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:18.021 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:18.313 align:middle line:90%
[STUTTERS]

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:19.814 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They'd come
at you like crazy.

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:20.649 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's it.

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:22.901 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there would be no
way you could get away.

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:26.488 align:middle line:84%
But what I found
interesting was that they

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:28.907 align:middle line:84%
were giving each
other enough space,

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:30.158 align:middle line:90%
however the seeds are put out.

00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: For their
own little area.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.619 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:34.704 align:middle line:90%
So that was pretty fascinating.

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So the plants weren't,
like, fighting over one thing.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:39.542 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:43.672 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe one would grow up,
and it would just eat it,

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:45.882 align:middle line:90%
and become the alpha plant.

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:46.716 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:47.926 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Like, this is what--

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:50.595 align:middle line:84%
so we studied this
for quite a long time.

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:53.014 align:middle line:90%
But it was definitely a plant.

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:54.683 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are there
any plants like this

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:57.602 align:middle line:90%
on the surface on Earth?

00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, not
that I'm aware of.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.896 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I know--

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.106 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I've heard of
the little Venus flytraps.

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:02.732 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Like the Venus
flytrap, another one

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:03.733 align:middle line:90%
with the sticky fingers.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.527 align:middle line:84%
I mean, other than
that, you know,

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:07.195 align:middle line:90%
I don't know of anything--

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:09.197 align:middle line:84%
I've never experienced
anything other than that.

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: This is more
frightening than looking

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.952 align:middle line:90%
at creatures on the inner Earth.

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:14.994 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, my goodness.

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.871 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I mean, my
gosh, a plant like that.

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:19.499 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: This was a very
misleading, number one,

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.332 align:middle line:90%
because of the size.

00:08:20.332 --> 00:08:21.918 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Can you
imagine the death,

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.336 align:middle line:90%
your death inside that plant?

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.129 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Slowly.

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:26.089 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Slowly and horrendous.

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:29.759 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, like burning,
you know, from your feet

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:32.971 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to your
head, slowly dissolving.

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:36.057 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did you see anything
else like this down there?

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:38.601 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, we
did see a plant

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:43.940 align:middle line:84%
with a type of animal in
it that was digesting it.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.775 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It had already
captured an animal.

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.152 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It had
already captured it.

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:47.694 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: My god.

00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:48.862 align:middle line:84%
Now, what kind of
plant was this?

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.989 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And it had the
most-- the same plant, just

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:52.365 align:middle line:90%
it was farther down the road.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.325 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Same plant,
though, exactly the same.

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:55.118 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:08:55.118 --> 00:09:02.333 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of
like a giant rabbit,

00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:04.377 align:middle line:84%
like if you cross a
deer with a rabbit,

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.045 align:middle line:90%
but without the antlers.

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:07.797 align:middle line:84%
But it was already
kind of half dissolved.

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:09.174 align:middle line:84%
And we did take
specimens of that

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and destroyed that
plant as well.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.221 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so that was, like, one
of the most horrific things

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:18.057 align:middle line:84%
I've ever seen on
these missions.

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:19.434 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Some
scientists, Emery,

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:24.522 align:middle line:84%
have said that plants have
the capability of reason

00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:25.315 align:middle line:90%
on the surface.

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:26.149 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:27.776 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: There
have been studies--

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:30.028 align:middle line:84%
and this is an
incredible story--

00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:35.575 align:middle line:84%
of a guy who put two plants
in a room with electrodes

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.702 align:middle line:90%
attached to the plants.

00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:42.123 align:middle line:84%
He sent a guy into the
room to kill and destroy

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:43.917 align:middle line:90%
one of the plants.

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:44.876 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:49.047 align:middle line:84%
He tore it up, ripped it
to shreds, everything else.

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:51.633 align:middle line:84%
And he had electrodes
on the other plant.

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:54.594 align:middle line:84%
And the electrodes would go
up and down, like, you know,

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:58.139 align:middle line:84%
because it was witnessing the
other plant getting killed.

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:00.350 align:middle line:90%
The guy left the room.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.186 align:middle line:84%
Another guy came in, and
the plant's electrodes

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:07.023 align:middle line:84%
were constant, you know,
just [HUMS CONSTANT TONE]..

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:09.359 align:middle line:84%
The other guy came
back in the room,

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:11.945 align:middle line:84%
the one who ripped up the
plant, and the electrodes

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:13.321 align:middle line:90%
went [IMITATES ALARM].

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:14.239 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's right.

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:16.032 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It had the
ability to reason.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.618 align:middle line:84%
Do you think these plants
on the inner Earth--

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:19.619 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I think every--

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: --have that
kind of mind power.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:21.746 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:25.250 align:middle line:84%
I believe in this
theory, very much so.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Even, like, cutting grass,
they've done studies, you know?

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.047 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they have
emotion, you know.

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:35.718 align:middle line:84%
We've done studies of talking to
plants and treating them well.

00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:38.012 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I talk
to all my plants.

00:10:38.012 --> 00:10:40.181 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What are
psychoactive plants?

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:41.432 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:42.809 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: On inner
Earth, you have

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:46.729 align:middle line:84%
to be very careful, especially
if you don't have a helmet,

00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:50.859 align:middle line:90%
because there could be a leaf.

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle line:90%
There could be a vine.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.406 align:middle line:84%
There could be something
that looks like a potato,

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:57.657 align:middle line:90%
you know, hanging somewhere.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:58.741 align:middle line:90%
And you're going to want--

00:10:58.741 --> 00:10:59.993 align:middle line:90%
or a piece of fruit.

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.452 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You think
you can eat it.

00:11:01.452 --> 00:11:04.914 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And you think maybe I
should harvest this, you know.

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:08.918 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't know what
it is, you better be careful.

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:11.838 align:middle line:84%
Because some of these
are like grenades,

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:14.090 align:middle line:90%
and they'll just explode.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.008 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: With poison?

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:15.592 align:middle line:90%
Are they poisonous?

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Just getting near it.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.304 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, they
have sensitivity.

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:23.182 align:middle line:84%
These things have these little
cilia hairs all over them.

00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:24.392 align:middle line:90%
And they have a sensitivity.

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:27.186 align:middle line:84%
And they can pick up on
your electromagnetic field.

00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:28.229 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And attack you.

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:29.022 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:31.608 align:middle line:84%
And it'd blow up, and this gas
comes out, and you're done.

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:32.692 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sheesh.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:35.153 align:middle line:90%
So you they have poisonous gas.

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.614 align:middle line:90%
They are poisonous to eat.

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:39.198 align:middle line:90%
How dangerous are these things?

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:40.658 align:middle line:84%
They're everywhere
down there then.

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:42.368 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, no,
there's also good stuff.

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:43.202 align:middle line:90%
There's good medicinal plants.

00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:44.454 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: How do you know?

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:47.874 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, we're trying
to slowly do a database on it.

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:51.794 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we lose people
on the way doing this.

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:55.798 align:middle line:84%
This is quite an
extreme adventure.

00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:59.093 align:middle line:90%
It's not just fun and games.

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a very serious thing.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.974 align:middle line:84%
Because one wrong step,
and then someone is--

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:06.434 align:middle line:90%
the mission's almost canceled.

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:07.435 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I would agree.

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:10.647 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You know,
we have to be very

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:12.398 align:middle line:90%
careful of every little thing.

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:15.401 align:middle line:84%
Even a blade of grass
that we're not aware of

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:16.486 align:middle line:90%
could be a sinkhole.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:18.738 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, let's get
back to psychoactive again.

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:90%
So what exactly is that?

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.953 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
psychoactive plants,

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:28.539 align:middle line:84%
if you were to breathe
them or eat them,

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:30.083 align:middle line:90%
will make you hallucinate.

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:32.126 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: We have that
here on the surface.

00:12:32.126 --> 00:12:32.919 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:34.504 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's the same
thing down there.

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:37.173 align:middle line:84%
There's different types of
fungi that are down there.

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:39.384 align:middle line:84%
They have mushrooms
down there as well,

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:41.010 align:middle line:84%
just like we have
mushrooms up here.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.637 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You got to be
careful which ones you eat.

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:44.722 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, and
which ones you step on.

00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:47.100 align:middle line:84%
It's the same kind of
situation down there.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.978 align:middle line:90%
It's just different species.

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:51.104 align:middle line:90%
A lot of different species.

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:52.814 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But they
seem more extreme.

00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:56.985 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They are--
they're very extreme.

00:12:56.985 --> 00:13:01.072 align:middle line:84%
But they have studied
these different types

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:05.326 align:middle line:84%
of plants that have these
psychoactive capabilities.

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
similar to the stuff

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.998 align:middle line:84%
that we have here
on the surface.

00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:12.041 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, like, this
plant that was sucking

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:13.292 align:middle line:90%
in the botanist--

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:14.127 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:18.089 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: If she had a knife on
her and stabbed the tentacle,

00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:21.342 align:middle line:84%
would the plant react to
it almost like an ouch

00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:22.760 align:middle line:90%
and let go of her?

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.804 align:middle line:90%
Or what would happen?

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.597 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: This plant
definitely did not.

00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:28.016 align:middle line:84%
Because we were
stabbing it, and--

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:29.142 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Nothing happened.

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It kept attacking us.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.353 align:middle line:84%
So it was definitely
going to win.

00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:33.604 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: So it didn't recoil.

00:13:33.604 --> 00:13:34.355 align:middle line:90%
It kept coming at you?

00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:35.648 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, it was going--

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:36.774 align:middle line:90%
this what it does.

00:13:36.774 --> 00:13:40.278 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was no way
that this conscious plant

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:43.072 align:middle line:84%
was going to give up because
this is what it does.

00:13:43.072 --> 00:13:48.536 align:middle line:84%
It's like jumping
in an alligator pit.

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:50.371 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you're
asking for it.

00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:51.164 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:53.665 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So this thing
was not stopping.

00:13:53.665 --> 00:13:57.754 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't have enough
time to grab her knife.

00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:59.589 align:middle line:90%
It was so quick.

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:02.133 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it left
marks on the ground

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:04.552 align:middle line:84%
where she was
trying to get away.

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:10.016 align:middle line:84%
But luckily, we were all within
100 yards or so and ran in.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:13.519 align:middle line:84%
And we all just started
basically cutting the limbs off

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:14.353 align:middle line:90%
of this plant.

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:18.232 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: The willow bark
of a tree on the surface

00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:20.318 align:middle line:90%
is the derivative of aspirin.

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:23.571 align:middle line:84%
That's how they got aspirin,
from the willow tree.

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:26.324 align:middle line:84%
Do you have things like
that in the inner Earth

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:29.410 align:middle line:84%
where maybe there's a cure
for cancer down there?

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.411 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, absolutely.

00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:33.831 align:middle line:84%
I think many pharmaceuticals
have been reverse engineered

00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:36.542 align:middle line:84%
from samples that have
come from inner Earth.

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:40.671 align:middle line:84%
There was many plants there
that we are very well aware of.

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.256 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That we
don't have on top.

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:43.716 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That we
don't have on top,

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:50.014 align:middle line:84%
that are excellent for
anti-microbial effects.

00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:52.100 align:middle line:84%
We also have plants
down there that they

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:57.188 align:middle line:84%
have found that destroy tumors
and cancers and all sorts

00:14:57.188 --> 00:15:01.567 align:middle line:84%
of very positive, very,
very positive things.

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:05.363 align:middle line:84%
But they are all kind
of connected too, which

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:06.864 align:middle line:84%
is another interesting
thing they've

00:15:06.864 --> 00:15:13.412 align:middle line:84%
been doing is connecting the
plants together, like you said,

00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:15.998 align:middle line:84%
with electrodes and
weird stuff like that,

00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:18.668 align:middle line:90%
and sending these special deep--

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:23.256 align:middle line:84%
these giant rods that
they drill into the ground

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:31.806 align:middle line:84%
that measure frequencies
of the plants in that area.

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:34.016 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Emery, you have
said on previous programs

00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:37.520 align:middle line:84%
that there also was an
extraterrestrial presence

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.398 align:middle line:84%
in the inner Earth,
that we've been visited,

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:42.358 align:middle line:90%
that there's craft there.

00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:45.653 align:middle line:84%
Might they have also brought
their own types of plants

00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:46.571 align:middle line:90%
and vegetation?

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:47.363 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:53.578 align:middle line:84%
I believe a lot of these
under Earth biospheres

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:57.206 align:middle line:84%
have been seeded by
extraterrestrial life.

00:15:57.206 --> 00:16:03.713 align:middle line:84%
Because we have found pieces
of extraterrestrial devices

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:08.634 align:middle line:84%
and different types of
tablets and writings.

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:13.055 align:middle line:84%
We've seen carvings
on the rock walls

00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:16.934 align:middle line:84%
that were done not
by a knife but maybe

00:16:16.934 --> 00:16:18.436 align:middle line:90%
like a laser or something.

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So could
those carnivorous plants

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.274 align:middle line:90%
have been ET-type plants?

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:26.444 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, they probably
were placed around an area

00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:29.530 align:middle line:84%
that they needed protected
probably, I was thinking.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.991 align:middle line:84%
Like, if I had a castle,
I'd put these things

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.284 align:middle line:90%
all the way around it.

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:34.368 align:middle line:90%
Screw the alligators.

00:16:34.368 --> 00:16:36.621 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Yeah, but they'd
come after you too one day.

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:37.872 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, maybe not.

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:40.082 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You got to be 50 feet
away from each one of them.

00:16:40.082 --> 00:16:40.875 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Maybe not.

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:43.252 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if you had their DNA,
they wouldn't touch you.

00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:44.962 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Could they--
would they reason?

00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:46.214 align:middle line:90%
Do they have reason?

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:51.052 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it's been proven
many times over in the labs

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:54.180 align:middle line:84%
that I've worked
with that if you

00:16:54.180 --> 00:17:00.061 align:middle line:84%
have the same DNA
on an ET or a plant

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:05.900 align:middle line:84%
or an animal that's aggressive
that it will not attack you.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.818 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Have you
studied these plants,

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:09.737 align:middle line:84%
where you dissected them
and things like that?

00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, yes, yes,
I was part of that.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.656 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did you
see anything unusual?

00:17:12.656 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle line:90%
What did you come across?

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.036 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, the most
unusual thing was inside,

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:19.704 align:middle line:90%
they had veins and arteries.

00:17:19.704 --> 00:17:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Like we do.

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:20.915 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:22.083 align:middle line:90%
And it was milk.

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:25.670 align:middle line:84%
It was pure, white,
milky substances.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.755 align:middle line:84%
And it was full of cells,
kind of like our cells,

00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:28.798 align:middle line:90%
like our red blood cells.

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:30.091 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Like our blood cells.

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:32.385 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And then--
but I never was

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:36.681 align:middle line:84%
able to be part of a team that
tested the milky substance.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:37.932 align:middle line:90%
I was there to extract it.

00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:40.476 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Which sounds like
blood almost, like, to a plant.

00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It did.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:45.147 align:middle line:84%
It looked like it was
basically-- it was bleeding.

00:17:45.147 --> 00:17:47.275 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Can you eat
any of this stuff?

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:49.735 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, there are many
plants that they have brought

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:56.367 align:middle line:84%
back that, through the
knowledge of extraterrestrials,

00:17:56.367 --> 00:18:00.538 align:middle line:84%
and also testing the
nutrient density--

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:03.040 align:middle line:84%
many tests are done are done
on all the different fruits

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.958 align:middle line:90%
and neat things.

00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.001 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But you've
eaten some of them.

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:06.627 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And I've eaten
a couple of things.

00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:07.962 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Did you ever get sick?

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:08.796 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, no.

00:18:08.796 --> 00:18:09.588 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:11.048 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It was
like a super food?

00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:13.926 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there was one,
they called the little bit.

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:18.889 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like
a egg-shaped--

00:18:18.889 --> 00:18:20.975 align:middle line:90%
a small watermelon.

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:23.644 align:middle line:84%
And it tasted like a
mixture between a blueberry

00:18:23.644 --> 00:18:24.478 align:middle line:90%
and a watermelon.

00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's a good taste.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, we
call it the bit.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:28.566 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: The bit?

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:30.443 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, we
call it the bit.

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:36.615 align:middle line:90%
And it looks like a giant--

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:38.743 align:middle line:84%
what do you call it--
an ostrich egg size.

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:39.577 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: OK.

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:41.829 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And it's blue.

00:18:41.829 --> 00:18:47.501 align:middle line:84%
And it tastes like watermelon
and blueberries mixed together.

00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:50.588 align:middle line:84%
And it has a peel on it,
like a very thin skin.

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:51.756 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Interesting taste.

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:54.884 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And soon as you
barely open it up, it's very--

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:59.013 align:middle line:84%
pulpy-- they're
pulpy very, very--

00:18:59.013 --> 00:19:01.766 align:middle line:84%
yeah, very beautiful
smell, like a rose.

00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:02.975 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And it tastes good.

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And it tastes amazing.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Have you eaten a
plant from the inner Earth

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.646 align:middle line:90%
that didn't taste good?

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:08.439 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:19:08.439 --> 00:19:09.815 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:10.649 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:13.110 align:middle line:84%
There's, like,
types of vegetables.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.653 align:middle line:84%
There's types of
fruits that you--

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:16.864 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do they have,
like, cherry trees and things

00:19:16.864 --> 00:19:17.073 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:19.533 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, there's
trees with fruits on them,

00:19:19.533 --> 00:19:23.746 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of sizes and different
sorts of classifications.

00:19:23.746 --> 00:19:25.956 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's
also poisonous fruits.

00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:27.124 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Well, that's true.

00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:28.709 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be
careful what you eat.

00:19:29.543 --> 00:19:32.797 align:middle line:84%
Have we been able to
take any of these plants

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:35.758 align:middle line:84%
and plant them here on the
top, to replicate them?

00:19:35.758 --> 00:19:38.677 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they have a
whole huge underground facility

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:40.679 align:middle line:90%
that just does that only.

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:41.514 align:middle line:90%
And not--

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:42.515 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Underground.

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:44.892 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, on a
military facility, yeah.

00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:45.726 align:middle line:90%
Well, not military,

00:19:45.726 --> 00:19:48.604 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Oh, you mean like
in a underground bunker?

00:19:48.604 --> 00:19:50.856 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, no, I'm talking
about in our facilities

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:51.690 align:middle line:90%
that I worked in.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.651 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: OK.

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:56.195 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They have huge
areas where they just

00:19:56.195 --> 00:20:00.574 align:middle line:84%
grow things from unEarth
or from Middle Earth.

00:20:00.574 --> 00:20:03.994 align:middle line:84%
And they even have
it in the cafeteria

00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:09.417 align:middle line:84%
where they can 3D print
the extraterrestrial fruit,

00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:10.709 align:middle line:90%
or the inner Earth fruit.

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:12.795 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Why don't they
grow them on the surface?

00:20:12.795 --> 00:20:14.171 align:middle line:84%
Are they afraid
of contamination?

00:20:14.171 --> 00:20:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, if
you look closely,

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.217 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
hybridization going on.

00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:19.885 align:middle line:84%
They started mixing
things together.

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:22.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, you see
broccolini now.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.140 align:middle line:84%
You see all these
different things.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.891 align:middle line:84%
They're mixing broccoli
with cauliflower.

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:29.812 align:middle line:84%
They're mixing-- all these
different vegetables are coming

00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:31.981 align:middle line:84%
out where they're
splicing the genes

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:36.026 align:middle line:84%
and making a new type of seed,
like a seedless watermelon.

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:37.236 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:38.028 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:38.028 --> 00:20:42.408 align:middle line:84%
So we have the ability already
to take vegetables and fruits

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:43.993 align:middle line:90%
and crossbreed them.

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:47.037 align:middle line:84%
And hybridization of
fruits and vegetables

00:20:47.037 --> 00:20:48.497 align:middle line:90%
have been done forever.

00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:50.708 align:middle line:90%
And they're doing that now.

00:20:50.708 --> 00:20:53.586 align:middle line:84%
And I believe they
are maybe putting

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:58.966 align:middle line:84%
some of these things coming from
underground with the vegetables

00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:01.385 align:middle line:84%
that I see recently
at the produce market.

00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:02.595 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You might be right.

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:04.138 align:middle line:90%
You may be absolutely right.

00:21:04.138 --> 00:21:08.309 align:middle line:84%
And also, there may be
pharmaceutical reasons

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:10.644 align:middle line:90%
for keeping all this quiet.

00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:13.314 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there are cures
for incredible diseases

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:14.815 align:middle line:90%
down there, Emery.

00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:17.193 align:middle line:84%
And big industry and
big pharma doesn't

00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:18.569 align:middle line:90%
want us to know about it.

00:21:18.569 --> 00:21:19.778 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:23.157 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, who
pays us to do these?

00:21:23.157 --> 00:21:26.911 align:middle line:84%
These compartmentalized projects
are paid by big pharma--

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:27.786 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, really?

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:31.582 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --and are paid
by other corporations.

00:21:31.582 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Organizations
and things.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.418 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The big ones,
the big corporations.

00:21:34.418 --> 00:21:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And they
want the secrets.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.506 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So yeah, they want
the secrets, of course.

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:41.842 align:middle line:84%
So we have special
teams that go in.

00:21:41.842 --> 00:21:45.471 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the funding
for this, we found out later,

00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:49.892 align:middle line:84%
does come from these giant
megalithic corporations.

00:21:49.892 --> 00:21:51.894 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: In addition to
the fruit that you had,

00:21:51.894 --> 00:21:53.938 align:middle line:84%
which you said was
pretty good, did you

00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:55.981 align:middle line:84%
have anything else,
nuts, anything like that?

00:21:55.981 --> 00:22:01.111 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, there was this
amazing walnut-type-looking

00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:02.196 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:22:02.196 --> 00:22:04.031 align:middle line:90%
And it was a seed.

00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:06.325 align:middle line:90%
But it was a big nut.

00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:09.537 align:middle line:90%
And it was woven inside.

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:11.497 align:middle line:84%
It had all these
nice weaves in it.

00:22:11.497 --> 00:22:13.249 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And you just
pick pieces off it?

00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:15.876 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, you could
eat the whole thing.

00:22:15.876 --> 00:22:20.381 align:middle line:84%
But the inside was the
best, these little strings

00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:21.924 align:middle line:90%
back and forth.

00:22:21.924 --> 00:22:23.884 align:middle line:90%
It was like a pretty--

00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:24.760 align:middle line:90%
like a piece of art.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.722 align:middle line:84%
Like, it reminded me
of someone carving

00:22:28.722 --> 00:22:31.141 align:middle line:84%
something out of something
and then hanging it up

00:22:31.141 --> 00:22:32.017 align:middle line:90%
as an ornament.

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:33.394 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And you just
break a piece off?

00:22:33.394 --> 00:22:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, you just
break a piece off and eat it.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:35.813 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: How'd it taste?

00:22:35.813 --> 00:22:37.815 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, it tasted
like a pistachio kind of.

00:22:37.815 --> 00:22:38.607 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:39.525 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:22:39.525 --> 00:22:44.113 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is,
when we measured this food

00:22:44.113 --> 00:22:47.616 align:middle line:84%
for nutrient density
testing and things,

00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:53.163 align:middle line:84%
we found that it
had more nutrients

00:22:53.163 --> 00:22:57.376 align:middle line:84%
than a normal
comparable Earth good.

00:22:57.376 --> 00:22:58.168 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I get it.

00:22:58.168 --> 00:22:59.295 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:59.295 --> 00:23:00.129 align:middle line:84%
Much more protein
and things like that.

00:23:00.129 --> 00:23:02.172 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: This
extraterrestrial food, right.

00:23:02.172 --> 00:23:05.092 align:middle line:84%
And it was a higher
grade of bioavailability

00:23:05.092 --> 00:23:09.013 align:middle line:90%
of whatever that nutrient was.

00:23:09.013 --> 00:23:13.601 align:middle line:84%
So it was, like, 10 to
100 times more nutrient

00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:17.062 align:middle line:90%
in a smaller density package.

00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:18.272 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's fascinating.

00:23:18.272 --> 00:23:19.857 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And so I
think there is a lot

00:23:19.857 --> 00:23:23.485 align:middle line:84%
of medical benefits to
these fruits and nuts

00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:25.487 align:middle line:90%
and things like this for humans.

00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:27.406 align:middle line:84%
And I know big pharma
knows about it for sure.

00:23:27.406 --> 00:23:28.198 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh, of course.

00:23:28.198 --> 00:23:28.991 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: You know?

00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:30.993 align:middle line:84%
And they probably don't
want that to get out,

00:23:30.993 --> 00:23:33.579 align:middle line:84%
because that'll
make us too healthy.

00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:35.581 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What are
the possibilities

00:23:35.581 --> 00:23:39.126 align:middle line:84%
that we've been contaminated
from outer space

00:23:39.126 --> 00:23:43.005 align:middle line:84%
on the surface, for example,
with vegetation, seeds,

00:23:43.005 --> 00:23:46.967 align:middle line:84%
that somehow they blew here on
a meteor or something like that?

00:23:46.967 --> 00:23:48.135 align:middle line:90%
Possible?

00:23:48.135 --> 00:23:48.969 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, right.

00:23:48.969 --> 00:23:51.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
where, you know, I

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.266 align:middle line:84%
believe mushrooms came
from and funguses.

00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:57.519 align:middle line:84%
I believe a lot of
plants and things

00:23:57.519 --> 00:24:01.482 align:middle line:84%
like that have fallen and have
come here from outer space

00:24:01.482 --> 00:24:02.983 align:middle line:90%
or seeded here from space.

00:24:02.983 --> 00:24:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Good ones or bad ones?

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.695 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Both,
both good and bad.

00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:09.782 align:middle line:84%
The truth to that is, yes,
that has definitely happened.

00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:17.748 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when we have
collected space debris

00:24:17.748 --> 00:24:20.959 align:middle line:84%
and bring it back, it goes
through a special process.

00:24:20.959 --> 00:24:22.169 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Of contamination?

00:24:22.169 --> 00:24:24.338 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Of decontamination.

00:24:24.338 --> 00:24:28.425 align:middle line:84%
But we actually-- we
don't decontaminate it.

00:24:28.425 --> 00:24:30.511 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to kill
anything that's on it.

00:24:30.511 --> 00:24:31.804 align:middle line:90%
We actually flush it.

00:24:31.804 --> 00:24:32.721 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You want it.

00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:34.932 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And we save what come--

00:24:34.932 --> 00:24:38.310 align:middle line:84%
let's just say we save
what goes down the drain.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.938 align:middle line:84%
And then we look at
that under a microscope.

00:24:40.938 --> 00:24:44.233 align:middle line:84%
And then we say, well,
look at this new cell.

00:24:44.233 --> 00:24:45.859 align:middle line:90%
What is this cell?

00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:48.570 align:middle line:84%
What's the DNA
structure of this cell?

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:49.571 align:middle line:90%
You know, is this good?

00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:49.988 align:middle line:90%
Is it bad?

00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:50.906 align:middle line:90%
Where'd it come from?

00:24:50.906 --> 00:24:52.700 align:middle line:84%
It was in space,
for god's sakes.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.077 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So you've been
studying this for a long time.

00:24:55.077 --> 00:24:55.869 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:24:55.869 --> 00:24:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are there
guidelines set up

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:01.750 align:middle line:84%
so you folks know exactly
what to do and what not to do?

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.127 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, my
goodness, there's

00:25:03.127 --> 00:25:07.840 align:middle line:84%
so many guidelines
and so many protocols.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:12.970 align:middle line:84%
It is a military-type,
organized team,

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:16.390 align:middle line:84%
or a scientific
organized team that

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:22.229 align:middle line:84%
has to follow special protocols
and directions for safety.

00:25:22.229 --> 00:25:25.023 align:middle line:90%
Because you could bring back--

00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:26.650 align:middle line:90%
you could bring back something--

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:28.902 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: This could be
the Andromeda strain.

00:25:28.902 --> 00:25:32.114 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: When you come back,
the first thing they put us in

00:25:32.114 --> 00:25:37.035 align:middle line:84%
is a big vacu seal
spray down container,

00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:39.079 align:middle line:84%
like you see in the movies
with the people that

00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:41.457 align:middle line:90%
get radiation poisoning.

00:25:41.457 --> 00:25:42.291 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:42.916 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Spray you down.

00:25:42.916 --> 00:25:44.668 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And then we
have to sit for eight

00:25:44.668 --> 00:25:48.338 align:middle line:84%
hours in another container
where they monitor us.

00:25:48.338 --> 00:25:50.257 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Just to make
sure that you're clean.

00:25:50.257 --> 00:25:54.178 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And then they have to
body scan us, each one of us,

00:25:54.178 --> 00:25:58.307 align:middle line:84%
before we even leave this
thing to make sure we're not--

00:25:58.307 --> 00:25:59.850 align:middle line:84%
we didn't bring
anything back inside.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.059 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: How about yourself?

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:02.394 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever get really sick?

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:03.228 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, no.

00:26:03.228 --> 00:26:08.567 align:middle line:84%
I've got a vertigo
a couple of times.

00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:09.860 align:middle line:90%
But you know, nothing serious.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.653 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What
would you say would

00:26:11.653 --> 00:26:14.865 align:middle line:84%
be the most spectacular
vegetation you've

00:26:14.865 --> 00:26:16.366 align:middle line:90%
seen in the inner Earth?

00:26:16.366 --> 00:26:17.826 align:middle line:84%
Would it be that
carnivorous plant?

00:26:17.826 --> 00:26:19.161 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, that was a very--

00:26:19.161 --> 00:26:19.828 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That was it.

00:26:19.828 --> 00:26:20.704 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That was it.

00:26:20.704 --> 00:26:22.539 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
something so intelligent.

00:26:22.539 --> 00:26:26.168 align:middle line:84%
And it could pick up on
your electromagnetic field.

00:26:26.168 --> 00:26:28.796 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Thinking back
retrospectively now,

00:26:28.796 --> 00:26:31.590 align:middle line:90%
did it act like it had a brain?

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.967 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It was conscious.

00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And it knew you were
there obviously.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, that
tells you something.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So did I have
a conversation with it?

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:46.063 align:middle line:90%
No, I didn't.

00:26:46.063 --> 00:26:49.024 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But if it could talk,
the stories it could tell.

00:26:49.024 --> 00:26:49.817 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Probably.

00:26:49.817 --> 00:26:52.027 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:26:52.027 --> 00:26:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: 15 feet wide?

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:55.531 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:56.865 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's huge.

00:26:56.865 --> 00:26:58.992 align:middle line:84%
That's half the
size of this studio.

00:26:58.992 --> 00:27:01.078 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, indeed.

00:27:01.078 --> 00:27:04.414 align:middle line:84%
But these branches were
the most incredible thing.

00:27:04.414 --> 00:27:08.168 align:middle line:84%
Because you would never
think it could extend.

00:27:08.168 --> 00:27:09.461 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Did they coil up?

00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:10.379 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how did they--

00:27:10.379 --> 00:27:12.422 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, they
actually just extend.

00:27:12.422 --> 00:27:13.632 align:middle line:90%
It's like more of a cone.

00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:15.092 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And it
just comes out it?

00:27:15.092 --> 00:27:16.134 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It just
comes right out.

00:27:16.134 --> 00:27:16.885 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And then
they come back in too?

00:27:16.885 --> 00:27:19.012 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And it's got all
these little bumps on it.

00:27:19.012 --> 00:27:19.972 align:middle line:90%
And that's what, like--

00:27:19.972 --> 00:27:20.764 align:middle line:90%
these little--

00:27:20.764 --> 00:27:21.723 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It grabs you.

00:27:21.723 --> 00:27:23.976 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's kind of
like having fingerprints.

00:27:23.976 --> 00:27:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Are they suction cups?

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.478 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:29.439 align:middle line:90%
No, it wasn't like that.

00:27:29.439 --> 00:27:36.613 align:middle line:84%
It just had, like I said, a lot
of ridges in it for grasping.

00:27:36.613 --> 00:27:44.246 align:middle line:84%
And a few-- yeah, and it
had a red center to it.

00:27:44.246 --> 00:27:47.624 align:middle line:84%
So it was green on the
outside but red on the inside.

00:27:47.624 --> 00:27:49.543 align:middle line:84%
So if you would turn
this thing and look

00:27:49.543 --> 00:27:55.215 align:middle line:84%
at it all the way around,
it had a color change to it.

00:27:55.215 --> 00:27:57.718 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And what about
the other gases that some

00:27:57.718 --> 00:27:58.969 align:middle line:90%
of these plants emitted?

00:27:58.969 --> 00:28:02.139 align:middle line:84%
You said that one had a
poisonous gas, if you got too

00:28:02.139 --> 00:28:04.141 align:middle line:90%
close, it would shoot at you.

00:28:04.141 --> 00:28:07.060 align:middle line:84%
What other things were
out there like that?

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there was a
lot of, like, just plants that

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:15.652 align:middle line:84%
looked like normal
flowers, let's say,

00:28:15.652 --> 00:28:20.908 align:middle line:84%
ones that looked like
giant sunflowers that

00:28:20.908 --> 00:28:23.744 align:middle line:90%
gave off an odor, just an odor.

00:28:23.744 --> 00:28:28.248 align:middle line:84%
And the odor alone would make
you unconscious if you walk--

00:28:28.248 --> 00:28:29.499 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Knock you right out?

00:28:29.499 --> 00:28:30.959 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It would just
knock you right out.

00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Wow.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:32.252 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:28:34.421 --> 00:28:36.131 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't carnivorous.

00:28:36.131 --> 00:28:37.382 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It wouldn't eat you.

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:37.925 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:28:37.925 --> 00:28:38.634 align:middle line:90%
I think it was a self--

00:28:38.634 --> 00:28:40.093 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It knocks you
out, then it eats you.

00:28:40.093 --> 00:28:40.469 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, no.

00:28:40.469 --> 00:28:41.261 align:middle line:90%
It didn't do it.

00:28:41.261 --> 00:28:42.095 align:middle line:90%
It would knock you.

00:28:42.095 --> 00:28:44.431 align:middle line:84%
But I think was a
self-defense mechanism it just

00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:50.812 align:middle line:84%
had built into it to protect its
area of just surviving there.

00:28:50.812 --> 00:28:53.857 align:middle line:84%
And then there was the vine,
so I was telling you about.

00:28:53.857 --> 00:28:57.277 align:middle line:84%
They have these things
on them, you know.

00:28:57.277 --> 00:29:01.323 align:middle line:84%
And if you get too close, they
would just explode and emit

00:29:01.323 --> 00:29:02.658 align:middle line:90%
this horrible gas.

00:29:02.658 --> 00:29:04.076 align:middle line:90%
And you'd be knocked out.

00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Gosh.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.871 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And so going walking
anywhere in the jungle,

00:29:07.871 --> 00:29:11.708 align:middle line:84%
or into the forest,
or even in the desert,

00:29:11.708 --> 00:29:13.126 align:middle line:90%
it was very dangerous.

00:29:13.126 --> 00:29:14.836 align:middle line:84%
You might see a
little blade of grass.

00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:16.338 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And bend
down to smell it.

00:29:16.338 --> 00:29:17.297 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And bend down.

00:29:17.297 --> 00:29:20.258 align:middle line:84%
And underneath, there's a
30-foot-wide creature there.

00:29:20.258 --> 00:29:21.051 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:29:21.051 --> 00:29:21.927 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: You know?

00:29:21.927 --> 00:29:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And we have sensors,
special motion sensors,

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:28.100 align:middle line:84%
that are built into
our suits and that

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.060 align:middle line:84%
come with the dogs
and everything,

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.187 align:middle line:84%
so if something starts
moving somewhere, especially

00:29:32.187 --> 00:29:36.817 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, these things go
off and pinpoint it immediately

00:29:36.817 --> 00:29:37.693 align:middle line:90%
on our map.

00:29:37.693 --> 00:29:38.944 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Just to protect you.

00:29:38.944 --> 00:29:40.404 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Just so
we know, oh, there

00:29:40.404 --> 00:29:42.614 align:middle line:84%
might be something
underground over here.

00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:46.660 align:middle line:84%
We had an amazing plant
that we came upon.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.329 align:middle line:90%
It was so beautiful.

00:29:49.329 --> 00:29:53.417 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't think, actually,
it was a plant because it

00:29:53.417 --> 00:29:55.961 align:middle line:90%
looked like a crystal.

00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Like a crystal
we would see here, right?

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:03.218 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, well, no,
like limbs and leaves.

00:30:03.218 --> 00:30:06.054 align:middle line:84%
And when you look up close at
them, they're all crystals.

00:30:06.054 --> 00:30:07.431 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Huh.

00:30:07.431 --> 00:30:08.306 align:middle line:90%
But it was a plant?

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:10.809 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: But it was a plant.

00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:13.145 align:middle line:90%
But it did have a stem.

00:30:13.145 --> 00:30:17.149 align:middle line:84%
And it had, you know,
no flowers on it

00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:20.152 align:middle line:84%
or anything like that, but
all these beautiful colored

00:30:20.152 --> 00:30:21.111 align:middle line:90%
crystals.

00:30:21.111 --> 00:30:22.946 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That's literally
growing crystals.

00:30:22.946 --> 00:30:26.867 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Like, growing crystals,
but it still had a stem,

00:30:26.867 --> 00:30:31.121 align:middle line:90%
and it still had plant cells.

00:30:31.121 --> 00:30:35.167 align:middle line:84%
But it was made up of crystals
on the outside of the plant.

00:30:35.167 --> 00:30:40.630 align:middle line:84%
So the plant was, emanating,
probably, like a sap maybe.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:42.799 align:middle line:84%
We were trying to
think of what this

00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:46.261 align:middle line:84%
could have been because I was
not part of the project when

00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:47.596 align:middle line:90%
they took it back to be--

00:30:47.596 --> 00:30:47.846 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's amazing.

00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:48.805 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --to find out.

00:30:48.805 --> 00:30:50.432 align:middle line:90%
But it was just so beautiful.

00:30:50.432 --> 00:30:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
poisonous, we found out.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.021 align:middle line:90%
But it was this beautiful bush.

00:30:56.021 --> 00:30:57.731 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Why would
you say the plants

00:30:57.731 --> 00:31:00.942 align:middle line:84%
on the inner Earth
would be so different

00:31:00.942 --> 00:31:02.569 align:middle line:90%
than the plants on the surface?

00:31:02.569 --> 00:31:04.863 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I mean, that
is a great question.

00:31:04.863 --> 00:31:09.993 align:middle line:84%
Because it has to do with the
mineral content of inner Earth.

00:31:09.993 --> 00:31:11.828 align:middle line:90%
It's different.

00:31:11.828 --> 00:31:13.371 align:middle line:84%
There's different
chemicals in there.

00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:14.498 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: All right.

00:31:14.498 --> 00:31:17.417 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There's
different minerals.

00:31:17.417 --> 00:31:20.212 align:middle line:84%
There's different
crystalline structures

00:31:20.212 --> 00:31:25.383 align:middle line:84%
that are under the ground there,
that help emit positive energy

00:31:25.383 --> 00:31:29.012 align:middle line:84%
to change plants, make
plants look different,

00:31:29.012 --> 00:31:32.265 align:middle line:84%
make them taste different,
make them grow different.

00:31:32.265 --> 00:31:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Because crystals are alive.

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:36.353 align:middle line:84%
We're crystalline
structure ourselves.

00:31:36.353 --> 00:31:39.689 align:middle line:84%
Our DNA on a small
scale is what?

00:31:39.689 --> 00:31:40.816 align:middle line:90%
We're crystal.

00:31:40.816 --> 00:31:44.611 align:middle line:84%
So it's neat to see all
of these cool new things

00:31:44.611 --> 00:31:47.322 align:middle line:84%
down there and understanding
that, man, they

00:31:47.322 --> 00:31:51.034 align:middle line:84%
got some really good fertilizer
to sit around in this place.

00:31:51.034 --> 00:31:53.286 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What has been
reverse engineered from plants

00:31:53.286 --> 00:31:54.830 align:middle line:90%
that you might know of?

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:58.708 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, most
pharmaceuticals are plant-based

00:31:58.708 --> 00:32:01.920 align:middle line:84%
or what we call
recombinantly made.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.174 align:middle line:84%
And that means taking
plants and, just

00:32:06.174 --> 00:32:09.803 align:middle line:84%
like in the old days
in Chinese medicine,

00:32:09.803 --> 00:32:12.139 align:middle line:84%
smashing them up and
mixing them into teas

00:32:12.139 --> 00:32:13.557 align:middle line:90%
and seeing what helps what.

00:32:13.557 --> 00:32:15.559 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But we've done
that with these plants.

00:32:15.559 --> 00:32:17.561 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And we have done
that with these plants

00:32:17.561 --> 00:32:19.312 align:middle line:90%
or parts of the plant.

00:32:19.312 --> 00:32:23.233 align:middle line:84%
Many advancements in
not only big pharma

00:32:23.233 --> 00:32:26.862 align:middle line:84%
but in materials
themselves have come

00:32:26.862 --> 00:32:31.158 align:middle line:84%
from other extraterrestrial
origins and inner Earth

00:32:31.158 --> 00:32:32.284 align:middle line:90%
origins.

00:32:32.284 --> 00:32:36.371 align:middle line:84%
So that tells you right there,
maybe the suit we're wearing

00:32:36.371 --> 00:32:41.334 align:middle line:84%
could have had something to
do with the fabric of a leaf.

00:32:41.334 --> 00:32:42.127 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Kevlar.

00:32:42.127 --> 00:32:42.919 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:32:42.919 --> 00:32:43.712 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Maybe.

00:32:43.712 --> 00:32:44.796 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Maybe.

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:48.842 align:middle line:84%
And like the bulletproof
leaf that we have acquired,

00:32:48.842 --> 00:32:53.263 align:middle line:84%
there was another
amazing type of leaf

00:32:53.263 --> 00:32:58.143 align:middle line:84%
that we found out
that was UV resistant.

00:32:58.143 --> 00:33:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of an iridescent
leaf that light cannot go

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.193 align:middle line:84%
through it, not the
brightest light in the world.

00:33:06.193 --> 00:33:08.236 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Make sunglasses
out of this thing, huh?

00:33:08.236 --> 00:33:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I mean, well,
you couldn't because you

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.072 align:middle line:90%
couldn't see through it.

00:33:11.072 --> 00:33:12.157 align:middle line:90%
It was that thick.

00:33:12.157 --> 00:33:13.658 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Oh, it
was that thick, OK.

00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So they have
come up with a paint now.

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:19.289 align:middle line:84%
It's called-- no,
no, it's called--

00:33:19.289 --> 00:33:21.583 align:middle line:90%
I'll just say super black.

00:33:21.583 --> 00:33:26.046 align:middle line:84%
And this black
paint, when put up,

00:33:26.046 --> 00:33:29.507 align:middle line:84%
or when the sun shines
on it, it absorbs it.

00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:30.425 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it.

00:33:30.425 --> 00:33:34.387 align:middle line:84%
Many of these
technologies have risen

00:33:34.387 --> 00:33:37.641 align:middle line:84%
from the advancements of
bringing these plants back

00:33:37.641 --> 00:33:38.850 align:middle line:90%
to the surface of the Earth.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.603 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But some of these
technologies came from ETs too,

00:33:41.603 --> 00:33:42.395 align:middle line:90%
didn't they?

00:33:42.395 --> 00:33:44.189 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: They sure did.

00:33:44.189 --> 00:33:47.817 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are they different,
the technologies that ET plants

00:33:47.817 --> 00:33:48.902 align:middle line:90%
are?

00:33:48.902 --> 00:33:52.572 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I think
they're also a hybridization.

00:33:52.572 --> 00:33:55.909 align:middle line:84%
You know, plants
intermingle, interpollinate.

00:33:55.909 --> 00:34:00.372 align:middle line:84%
So the answer to that
is, yes, yes, and yes.

00:34:00.372 --> 00:34:04.834 align:middle line:84%
Because they did come from
somewhere, from inner Earth

00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:06.336 align:middle line:90%
or from another planet.

00:34:06.336 --> 00:34:07.587 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Genetically altered.

00:34:07.587 --> 00:34:12.342 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And genetically altered
and regenetically altered,

00:34:12.342 --> 00:34:13.717 align:middle line:90%
and regenetically altered.

00:34:13.717 --> 00:34:19.099 align:middle line:84%
So it's an ongoing process
of the plants coming from all

00:34:19.099 --> 00:34:20.766 align:middle line:90%
over.

00:34:20.766 --> 00:34:24.562 align:middle line:84%
They're seeding here, just
like we were seeded here.

00:34:24.562 --> 00:34:26.147 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Emery, how
have we benefited

00:34:26.147 --> 00:34:28.315 align:middle line:84%
from all these
incredible plants that

00:34:28.315 --> 00:34:30.902 align:middle line:84%
either came from ET
technology or were

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:32.821 align:middle line:90%
part of the inner Earth?

00:34:32.821 --> 00:34:36.908 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Look at all of the
new pharmaceuticals coming out.

00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:42.706 align:middle line:84%
Look at how they're
investigating and approving

00:34:42.706 --> 00:34:47.543 align:middle line:84%
plants that were not approved
before, like marijuana.

00:34:47.543 --> 00:34:50.213 align:middle line:84%
All these things are all
linked to inner Earth

00:34:50.213 --> 00:34:53.300 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrial-type--

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.217 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Flora.

00:34:54.217 --> 00:34:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --flora.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:58.805 align:middle line:84%
They're just now
admitting in Oregon

00:34:58.805 --> 00:35:02.475 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to
start approving psilocybin

00:35:02.475 --> 00:35:03.685 align:middle line:90%
from mushrooms.

00:35:03.685 --> 00:35:05.979 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's right.

00:35:05.979 --> 00:35:09.399 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And that's an
extraterrestrial, you know,

00:35:09.399 --> 00:35:11.359 align:middle line:90%
fungus.

00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:15.572 align:middle line:84%
So we're benefiting
because everyone now

00:35:15.572 --> 00:35:23.079 align:middle line:84%
is trying to get on board
and test these things

00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:26.499 align:middle line:84%
the right way,
doing white papers,

00:35:26.499 --> 00:35:30.670 align:middle line:84%
getting patients, instead
of just saying, well,

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:33.923 align:middle line:84%
this, this, we can't use
this, we can't use that.

00:35:33.923 --> 00:35:35.467 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: But how
do we know, though,

00:35:35.467 --> 00:35:39.929 align:middle line:84%
that the ET technology and the
plants from the inner Earth

00:35:39.929 --> 00:35:42.474 align:middle line:90%
are working to help us?

00:35:42.474 --> 00:35:44.809 align:middle line:84%
Do you have inside
information to that?

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I just
know that the ETs

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:50.231 align:middle line:84%
have seeded the Earth with
many plants a long time ago.

00:35:50.231 --> 00:35:51.191 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: To help us.

00:35:51.191 --> 00:35:52.484 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: To help us.

00:35:52.484 --> 00:35:56.071 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
proven over 3,000 years

00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:58.531 align:middle line:90%
of Chinese herbal medicine.

00:35:58.531 --> 00:36:00.909 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I'm trying
to get everyone to go,

00:36:00.909 --> 00:36:04.037 align:middle line:84%
to get off of, you know, big
pharma, which is chemicals.

00:36:04.037 --> 00:36:07.749 align:middle line:84%
Because really, they
just took the same plant

00:36:07.749 --> 00:36:12.587 align:middle line:84%
that the Chinese used
for your cough medicine,

00:36:12.587 --> 00:36:14.506 align:middle line:84%
and then they added a
bunch of chemicals to it

00:36:14.506 --> 00:36:18.051 align:middle line:84%
and sell it at the
shelf at the drugstore.

00:36:18.051 --> 00:36:21.388 align:middle line:84%
And we don't need all that extra
stuff, which dumbs us down.

00:36:21.388 --> 00:36:23.264 align:middle line:90%
It also makes us even more sick.

00:36:23.264 --> 00:36:25.475 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I was speaking
with big pharma and all

00:36:25.475 --> 00:36:27.936 align:middle line:84%
the bigwigs, once
I said, well, you

00:36:27.936 --> 00:36:31.272 align:middle line:84%
know we need to do
is you need to have

00:36:31.272 --> 00:36:35.360 align:middle line:84%
an apothecary at
every drugstore.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:40.824 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're so
conscious that the body,

00:36:40.824 --> 00:36:43.410 align:middle line:84%
if it had a choice-- which
you don't get a choice.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:45.078 align:middle line:90%
You have to take this pill.

00:36:45.078 --> 00:36:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
only pill you can take.

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:50.417 align:middle line:84%
But if you had a choice
to take this pill

00:36:50.417 --> 00:36:52.460 align:middle line:90%
or this natural pill--

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.837 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Go for the natural.

00:36:53.837 --> 00:36:56.339 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --your
body and the plant

00:36:56.339 --> 00:36:59.717 align:middle line:84%
that's in there will
communicate with you,

00:36:59.717 --> 00:37:01.928 align:middle line:90%
and you'll pick the right one.

00:37:01.928 --> 00:37:04.848 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to do
it because they're going

00:37:04.848 --> 00:37:07.142 align:middle line:90%
get to charge an extra 1% more.

00:37:07.142 --> 00:37:09.519 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Emery, thanks for
being on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:37:09.519 --> 00:37:10.603 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Thanks for
having me, George.

00:37:10.603 --> 00:37:11.729 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I'm George Noory.

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:13.731 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for watching
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:14.649 align:middle line:10%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:37:14.732 --> 00:37:17.235 align:middle line:10%
>> Next season on
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:20.655 align:middle line:10%
>> Now the security guard walked
in the door with a sidearm.

00:37:20.655 --> 00:37:21.906 align:middle line:90%
He didn't point it.

00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:24.033 align:middle line:84%
It was just that
he had ammunition

00:37:24.033 --> 00:37:25.452 align:middle line:90%
within sight of a Grey.

00:37:25.452 --> 00:37:27.287 align:middle line:90%
And they killed him instantly.

>> We can make a
jumbo jet in the air,

00:37:29.205 --> 00:37:31.374 align:middle line:84%
and you guys would all
believe it's a real jumbo jet.

00:37:31.374 --> 00:37:32.625 align:middle line:90%
It could even cast a shadow.

00:37:32.625 --> 00:37:36.379 align:middle line:84%
So we've used 3D holographic
imaging in the projects

00:37:36.379 --> 00:37:38.256 align:middle line:90%

secret stuff going on.
