00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are talking about weapons

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.950 align:middle line:10%
of the SSP with Randy Cramer.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.270 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>> From what you have seen
from other plants and ET

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.920 align:middle line:84%
civilizations, are they more or
less peaceful than what we know

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.053 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth?

00:00:35.053 --> 00:00:36.470 align:middle line:10%
>> There's just a
variation there.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.620 align:middle line:10%
So you have species who are
better at aggression, better

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.660 align:middle line:10%
at war than others.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, aggression
is a genetic trait,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:84%
and there are species who
have higher aggression

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:84%
levels, species who have lower
aggression levels, species

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:84%
who've evolved out
their aggression levels.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's as
many possibilities

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.740 align:middle line:90%
as you can think of.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.420 align:middle line:84%
So what we find out there is
there are many species who

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.890 align:middle line:84%
are happy to pick up
a weapon and fight,

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.713 align:middle line:84%
and there are a lot
of species too that

00:01:09.713 --> 00:01:10.880 align:middle line:90%
just aren't that good at it.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So they either would rather
have someone else do it for them

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.170 align:middle line:84%
or get their butt kicked because
they're just not good at it.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, even if they are
peaceful civilizations,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.910 align:middle line:84%
how important is it for them and
their society to actually have

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:90%
weapons?

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.170 align:middle line:84%
For some of them, it's
just not that important

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.120 align:middle line:84%
until something happens,
and then all of a sudden,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.450 align:middle line:90%
they need it.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.950 align:middle line:90%
They're not expansionist.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.580 align:middle line:84%
They're not trying to
colonize far and wide

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.218 align:middle line:90%
into hostile territory.

00:01:36.218 --> 00:01:38.510 align:middle line:84%
They're really just concerned
about planetary security.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.603 align:middle line:84%
So mostly, their security
forces keep the peace

00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:84%
but aren't going to
be able to withstand

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.390 align:middle line:84%
an invasion or any kind of
hostile military action.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.340 align:middle line:84%
They're just not trained
for it or equipped.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>> As a soldier, tell us some of
the weapons that you employed.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>> My favorite is the railgun,
because it's the most accurate

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.630 align:middle line:90%
over the longest distance.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.390 align:middle line:84%
For anyone who's fired
a normal firearm,

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.360 align:middle line:84%
imagine a rifle that doesn't
kick and stays straight

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.280 align:middle line:90%
and shoots motionless variants--

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.860 align:middle line:84%
no kick, no shake,
right out the barrel--

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.450 align:middle line:84%
one, two, three,
right after another.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.250 align:middle line:90%
So they're incredibly accurate.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.400 align:middle line:84%
They don't heat up like
a chemically propelled

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.775 align:middle line:90%
projectile does.

00:02:23.775 --> 00:02:24.900 align:middle line:90%
They're really my favorite.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:84%
You've got the greatest, longest
straight shot over a distance.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I do have a little bit
of experience with these,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:90%
and they are electromagnetic.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.192 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:34.192 --> 00:02:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe you can explain to us
how does that work with that

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle line:84%
projectile and how
the charge works.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So if the barrel
is about this long,

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.020 align:middle line:84%
you have a series
of electromagnets

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:90%
that go along the barrel.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So they're all in the off
position, and the projectile,

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.330 align:middle line:84%
which again is a metal magnetic
projectile that goes here--

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.500 align:middle line:84%
so the first
electromagnetic is turned on

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.710 align:middle line:84%
to create a magnetic field that
holds on to the projectile.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
magnet in front of it

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.890 align:middle line:84%
is turned on at the same time
that the magnet behind it

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.880 align:middle line:90%
is turned off.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And that all happens in about
a nanosecond from here to here.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.757 align:middle line:84%
So very, very quickly, as each
subsequent magnet turns on

00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and the one behind it turns
off, it grabs the projectile

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:84%
and pulls it down the rail
and then fires it out the end.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.350 align:middle line:84%
But again, it happens
in a nanosecond.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.090 align:middle line:84%
So it just pulls it super
fast straight down the barrel

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:90%
without an explosion.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And again, so there's
less heat, no kick.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.070 align:middle line:90%
They're fragments.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>> What do they look like?

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.492 align:middle line:90%
Do they have rifles and pistols?

00:03:34.492 --> 00:03:35.450 align:middle line:90%
What do they look like?

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>> To be honest, they look
like a fairly normal rifle--

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a little fancier,
but a main housing,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.330 align:middle line:84%
a stock with a
pistol grip if it's

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.180 align:middle line:84%
something you're holding
in your hand with a stock

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.440 align:middle line:90%
and a barrel on it.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have a
pistol grip down here.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.640 align:middle line:84%
That's if the rifle is
not attached to your suit.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the more
advanced exosuits

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.790 align:middle line:84%
has it mounted on the right arm,
so all you have to do is point.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you aim with it, then?

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Is it just like we
utilize our rifles today?

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So it actually has a
laser-guided system

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.720 align:middle line:90%
that shows up in your HUD.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.839 align:middle line:84%
So you can hip shoot
very accurately,

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.180 align:middle line:84%
because your HUD is
telling you exactly

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.810 align:middle line:84%
where your reticle from the
laser pointer on the weapon

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.610 align:middle line:90%
are pointing at.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So in some cases,
with the one that

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.120 align:middle line:84%
has a full stock
body on it, there's

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.650 align:middle line:84%
a scope that you can use,
but it's not required.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:84%
If you want to see something
for a long distance

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and get a close up
shot, use the scope.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.420 align:middle line:84%
But anything within 100 yards
or so, you can just pull up

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.222 align:middle line:84%
your hip shoot, and your
reticle on your heads up display

00:04:50.222 --> 00:04:52.430 align:middle line:84%
will show you exactly where
you're going to hit and--

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.720 align:middle line:90%
[SHOOTING NOISES] yeah.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>> How many rounds
do these railguns--

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:84%
the handheld railguns,
I should say, too.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:90%
Usually, there's an ammo box--

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.100 align:middle line:84%
we refer to as a clip even
though it's not a clip--

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.842 align:middle line:84%
which usually holds
about 100 rounds.

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the
rounds made out of?

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a metal alloy
that's harder than uranium.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So instead of using a
Sabot round to puncture--

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.160 align:middle line:84%
whatever this is made out of,
some really, really tough alloy

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.190 align:middle line:84%
that punctures
through most armor.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, our current military
actually has cannons like this,

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:26.710 align:middle line:90%
correct?

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.230 align:middle line:84%
The Navy has been
putting railguns

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.510 align:middle line:90%
on ships for a few years now.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.990 align:middle line:84%
They had their first destroyer
roll out a few years ago

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.342 align:middle line:90%
with railguns on them.

00:05:36.342 --> 00:05:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I think I
just read that they're

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.980 align:middle line:84%
starting to put energy
projected weapons that

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:84%
can shoot planes and
missiles out of the sky too.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.260 align:middle line:10%
So the Navy ships right now are
being equipped with railguns

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.170 align:middle line:10%
and directed energy weapons.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, tell us more
about these plasma rifles

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.190 align:middle line:90%
you've mentioned in the past.

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So the plasma rifle
takes a super, super hot,

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.830 align:middle line:84%
heated ball of plasma, puts it
in a contained electromagnetic

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:84%
field, and then again, launches
it down a rail that guides it

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and sends it out
the end of the gun,

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.830 align:middle line:84%
which I'm told that it's several
thousand feet per second.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:84%
The range is dependent
on the sustainability

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.760 align:middle line:90%
of the electromagnetic field.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.980 align:middle line:84%
So few hundred yards out,
the electromagnetic field

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:84%
dissipates, and that causes
the plasma ball to dissipate.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.400 align:middle line:84%
But anything within that first
couple yards is going to get

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:36.790 align:middle line:84%
hit with a 5,000-degree hot
ball of plasma that will burn

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and melt through
just about anything.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, on the missions that
you've been on, when would you

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.520 align:middle line:84%
choose a plasma
rifle over a railgun?

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It usually
wouldn't be my choice.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.260 align:middle line:84%
It would be a matter of whether
they felt like the railgun was

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.750 align:middle line:84%
going to be the most effective
close-up weapon if we were

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.760 align:middle line:84%
going to be in close
quarters combat,

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.850 align:middle line:84%
or if we were going to need the
extended range of the railgun,

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.890 align:middle line:84%
or if it was going to be
something that was just

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:84%
going to likely be nothing more
than a couple hundred yards.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.878 align:middle line:84%
It's decided based
on other criteria

00:07:05.878 --> 00:07:07.420 align:middle line:84%
that we're not
deciding in the field.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's decided by intelligence
personnel and command officers

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.300 align:middle line:84%
way before we're ever
put in the field,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:84%
and they tell us which
one we're going to carry.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, what defensive systems
would you have against these

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.520 align:middle line:90%
if your opponent had them?

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a personal
shielding that can deflect them.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.500 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially an
electromagnetic shield

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.380 align:middle line:90%
that will basically--

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.750 align:middle line:84%
like north pole north
pole on a magnet

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.190 align:middle line:84%
will cause to deflect a
magnetically contained

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.845 align:middle line:84%
ball of hot plasma, as it hits
the shield, will bounce off.

00:07:38.845 --> 00:07:40.720 align:middle line:84%
It does the same thing
to a metal projectile,

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:90%
actually, too.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And what device is that
that's on you that allows that

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:46.690 align:middle line:90%
to be eminating?

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming it's an
electromagnetic toroidal field

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.950 align:middle line:84%
around you that
blocks everything.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's a shield generator
that's usually in the pack.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:58.330 align:middle line:84%
The pack is the back
portion of the suit, which

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.130 align:middle line:84%
is where the power
system is contained,

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:01.750 align:middle line:84%
the circulation
system is contained,

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and any other
systems that aren't

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.240 align:middle line:84%
local somewhere in the
suit are all in the pack.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>> You seem to have a lot of
electronics on these suits that

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.850 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Is there any risk for
radiation or electromagnetic

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.620 align:middle line:84%
pulse from these suits
that could cause your cells

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.310 align:middle line:90%
and your DNA to be damaged?

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>> They have a really good
radiation shielding on them,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.820 align:middle line:84%
so the radiation would have
to be really, really high.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.950 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I mean,
electromagnetic pulse

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.090 align:middle line:90%
is a risk at that point.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And so it wouldn't be the
first time or the last time

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:84%
that someone was
wearing an exosuit that

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.740 align:middle line:84%
had to jump out of it because
it was no longer operational.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So in the larger suits, we
call the papa bear suit,

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.245 align:middle line:84%
flip of a button, and
the thing pops open,

00:08:53.245 --> 00:08:54.620 align:middle line:84%
and you can jump
right out of it.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.610 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>> During the break, we
got into the exosuits,

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to talk about
those a little bit more.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.130 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to talk about, number
one, what do they look like?

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.860 align:middle line:90%
How do you enter them?

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And what's the power
supply for them?

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.030 align:middle line:90%
Is that also with the pack?

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, definitely.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm not 100% sure what
the power system is other

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:20.180 align:middle line:84%
than over time, I've seen them
change as far as the size.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.350 align:middle line:84%
So a couple decades
early in my career,

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:29.150 align:middle line:84%
the power supply was about
the size of a shoe box.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Towards the end of my
career, the power supplies

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.820 align:middle line:84%
were closer to the size
of a pack of cigarettes.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And what kind of
power supply is that?

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Where's it getting
that energy from?

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Usually a zero point or an
electron pump of some kind.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So there's something that can
continually pull out joules

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.130 align:middle line:84%
pretty much forever until
the system itself is damaged.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:84%
But they're small, so you
can't build a bomb out

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.040 align:middle line:90%
of them, really.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.873 align:middle line:84%
>> Through your experience
on your missions,

00:09:55.873 --> 00:09:59.380 align:middle line:84%
has there ever been a time that
your weapons failed against

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.370 align:middle line:90%
an opponent?

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>> It's incredibly
rare, incredibly rare.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:06.830 align:middle line:84%
The failure rate of the
equipment is less than 1%,

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.440 align:middle line:84%
and there are very
few situations

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.950 align:middle line:84%
that we would encounter--
again, because of our good intel

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.510 align:middle line:84%
on what we're going
into, we don't

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:84%
go into a situation
with equipment

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.620 align:middle line:84%
that we have a sense is
not going to work well.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So we have a few variations
in the type of equipment

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:25.330 align:middle line:84%
that we can use to be mission
ready for different defensive

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:90%
circumstances.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So if we think that
electromagnetic pulse is

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.470 align:middle line:90%
an option--

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.300 align:middle line:84%
our likely defensive
option, we're not

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.860 align:middle line:90%
going to use certain exosuits.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.900 align:middle line:84%
We might use
something different.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Were any of those weapons
ineffective during a combat

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:45.053 align:middle line:84%
moment where, oh,
it's not firing?

00:10:45.053 --> 00:10:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>> There were a couple of times
when we were engaging with

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.575 align:middle line:90%
the indigenous reptoids on Mars.

00:10:50.575 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And we know after
the fact that they

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:56.980 align:middle line:84%
were using psionic
abilities, so it would often

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.890 align:middle line:84%
be that we could not
hit them from a distance

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.780 align:middle line:84%
or the weapons wouldn't
work at a distance.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And we would have to get
closer and closer and closer,

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.300 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted
close-quarters combat.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.840 align:middle line:84%
So we would find the
inconsistent operational rates

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.842 align:middle line:90%
at a distance were up and down.

00:11:11.842 --> 00:11:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And because they
were inconsistent,

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:19.330 align:middle line:84%
we didn't think it was
mechanical failure or that 1%

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.235 align:middle line:90%
of manufacturing defects.

00:11:21.235 --> 00:11:22.610 align:middle line:84%
We figured it was
something else.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.340 align:middle line:84%
But it took some time
before we learned

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.230 align:middle line:90%
that it was psionic abilities.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Once, you have mentioned
to me about the scorpions,

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.640 align:middle line:90%
these giant creatures.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.800 align:middle line:84%
What were you using
against them as far

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.960 align:middle line:90%
as weapons and protection?

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Railgun, body armor,
personal shield--

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.900 align:middle line:10%
that was about it.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.690 align:middle line:84%
So again, it was
fairly effective,

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.440 align:middle line:84%
we were just overwhelmed
by their numbers.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.480 align:middle line:84%
If there were less
of them, I think

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.520 align:middle line:84%
we could have handled
them, but when

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:84%
you're outnumbered 20 to 1,
it starts to get difficult.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And these railguns
have an automatic setting?

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.030 align:middle line:84%
What kind of settings do
the guns have on them?

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>> The weapon itself--

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the single shot,
triburst, full-auto--

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's that option.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:10.890 align:middle line:84%
There is also a difference
in the projectile.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:15.720 align:middle line:84%
So we had air burst ammo,
which is essentially

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.270 align:middle line:84%
a projectile that's made up of
many, many little parts that

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.760 align:middle line:84%
are held together by this
electromagnetic field,

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.600 align:middle line:84%
so then when it flies out of
the barrel, it breaks apart,

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and you get a lot of little
projectiles flying out the end.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:28.910 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Kind of like a cluster bomb.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, basically like a
little cluster bomb on the end

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.690 align:middle line:90%
of a bullet.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:37.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's way more
powerful than a shotgun.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:41.730 align:middle line:84%
An air burst that breaks apart
three feet in front of someone

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.810 align:middle line:84%
will completely tear
their upper body apart.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Like on the planes and the
helicopters where they have

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.460 align:middle line:84%
the chaff that shoots
out and discombobulates,

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:84%
is there weapons and is
there ammo that you can put

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.420 align:middle line:84%
in your weapons
to discombobulate

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.900 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials' sonic
abilities that would distort

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:58.290 align:middle line:90%
them?

00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>> We did not have any.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:03.120 align:middle line:84%
We did not have specific weapons
that were for that purpose.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.880 align:middle line:84%
There were drones and
frequency emitters

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:84%
that the intel teams
would sometimes use,

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.500 align:middle line:84%
but that's not something
I'm too familiar with.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Were the extraterrestrial
weapons ever just far exceeded

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.680 align:middle line:84%
the technology we
had of those weapons?

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>> There was this one time when
there was a species that was

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.140 align:middle line:90%
using a weapon that--

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.520 align:middle line:90%


00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
else to explain it--

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.860 align:middle line:84%
if I was to point the
weapon at you and fire it,

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.190 align:middle line:84%
it would take all of
the water in your body

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.480 align:middle line:90%
and move it to another time.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's a temporal weapon
that takes your water out

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.600 align:middle line:84%
of your body and moves it
to another part in time.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So all you're left with
is the dry molecules,

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.150 align:middle line:84%
so you're instantly
dehydrated and turned to dust.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>> You're instantly just
a couple grams of powder.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:56.822 --> 00:13:58.030 align:middle line:90%
Poof.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:13:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.887 align:middle line:84%
So that's an
interdimensional weapon, huh?

00:14:01.887 --> 00:14:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a temporal weapon.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Temporal weapon.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:90%
What's that mean?

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>> That means it's using
temporal mechanics--

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.130 align:middle line:90%
the mechanics of time--

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:09.930 align:middle line:90%
to operate.

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, it's basically time
traveling the water molecules

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.070 align:middle line:90%
in your body to somewhere else.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Which to me, I always think
about the other effect of it.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.120 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere, someone
is standing there,

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.940 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden there's
your water somewhere,

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.490 align:middle line:84%
and then it just
falls to the ground.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what was that?

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.140 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere, your water ends
up where your body is not,

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and your body turns to
dust, and your water

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:middle line:90%
is then without a body.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I was working on some
projects in New York where they

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:47.310 align:middle line:84%
were utilizing technology just
to remove toxins in the body

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.910 align:middle line:90%
and cancers.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And one of the side effects
was people would lose weight

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.900 align:middle line:90%
in these Teslatron units.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists still did
not know, even though it worked,

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.600 align:middle line:90%
where that substance was going.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So I was always
thinking, someone

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.530 align:middle line:84%
over in Arturis or
something all of a sudden

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:08.143 align:middle line:84%
just got a pound of fat slapped
in their face or something.

00:15:08.143 --> 00:15:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
all right, we're

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.098 align:middle line:84%
going to shut those guys
down over there on Earth.

00:15:12.098 --> 00:15:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Just because you're
throwing a bowling ball

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.230 align:middle line:84%
through a field
of energy and you

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:20.040 align:middle line:84%
don't know where it's going,
that's a little disrespectful.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you get a call later
saying, hey, cut that out.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, you gotta stop that.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Do we have temporal weapons
today that you know about?

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as I understand,
we're experimenting with them.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I've never used
one in the field,

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:34.560 align:middle line:84%
but we're definitely
experimenting with them.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And what about these
frequency modulators that you

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.000 align:middle line:90%
talked about?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>> The frequency modulators--
so they modulate frequencies,

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.530 align:middle line:84%
which makes them a fairly
universal tool depending

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:51.810 align:middle line:84%
on what you need to disrupt
and/or try and protect.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle line:84%
If you're trying to
protect something

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.460 align:middle line:84%
with a field modulation,
it can work for that.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.040 align:middle line:84%
If you're trying to disrupt
another energy frequency,

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.640 align:middle line:84%
whether it's psionic or
electronic, electromagnetic,

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.330 align:middle line:84%
technological, there
are ways in which

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.770 align:middle line:84%
you can use a frequency
modulator that

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.467 align:middle line:84%
can make internal
combustion engines not work.

00:16:13.467 --> 00:16:15.050 align:middle line:84%
You can send out a
frequency that will

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.000 align:middle line:90%
make electric motors not work.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.510 align:middle line:84%
You can use frequency
modulation to heat up

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:25.040 align:middle line:84%
mechanical parts in a gun
so that a gun won't work.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.830 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of different
uses for frequency modulation--

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.290 align:middle line:84%
more than I could list,
to be honest with you.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, were the weapons that
the humans used in the SSP,

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.780 align:middle line:84%
were they comparable
to the ETs'?

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say, at this point,
we make better stuff than most

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:40.880 align:middle line:90%
of everybody else.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:46.940 align:middle line:84%
So while there are weapons out
there that far surpass our own,

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.550 align:middle line:84%
there are many tools
and weapons out there

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:84%
that don't compare to
the stuff that we make.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, were any of these
completely different than

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:57.260 align:middle line:90%
anything you've seen here?

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:02.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was actually a
species that had a little--

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:90%
looked like a little magic wand.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.200 align:middle line:84%
You can barely see it-- a little
metal rod about like that.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.119 align:middle line:84%
And it had, apparently,
three settings.

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:09.619 align:middle line:90%
And it could either--

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:11.720 align:middle line:84%
it was basically a
frequency modulator.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.859 align:middle line:84%
And it either modulate with
the magnesium in your body

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:20.690 align:middle line:84%
or the potassium in
your body or the iodine.

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So the magnesium, essentially,
because your magnesium

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.920 align:middle line:84%
receptors in your central
nervous system are the relaxing

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.070 align:middle line:84%
receptors-- that's a stunner
can knock someone out--

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:36.248 align:middle line:84%
the sodium resonator can
cause incredible pain,

00:17:36.248 --> 00:17:38.540 align:middle line:84%
because it's activating all
your central nervous system

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.440 align:middle line:90%
receptors.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, the
iodine frequency

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.870 align:middle line:84%
causes your hemoglobin
to start to pop,

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:48.570 align:middle line:84%
and you basically
rupture blood vessels--

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>> You hemolize inside of you.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you basically
blow apart on the inside.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Can anyone--

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as I know, we don't
have anything like that.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, but can a human
use that or only the ET?

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The weapon itself
is tuned to their DNA.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, if you pick it up and
it doesn't have the right DNA

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.610 align:middle line:84%
to match with the
weapon, you can't use it.

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't pick up one
of those weapons and use it.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.190 align:middle line:84%
But again, if we
developed one, we could.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.460 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know that we're
using those or developing

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.670 align:middle line:90%
those at this time.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Are any of the weapons
that you have utilized reverse

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:84%
engineered from
extraterrestrials?

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Pretty much all of them,
as far as I understand.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.920 align:middle line:84%
The fundamental basis
of all of our technology

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.620 align:middle line:84%
comes from somebody else's
technology originally.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we add our
own creative potential to that

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.720 align:middle line:84%
and modify them in ways that
we think are specific to us,

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.610 align:middle line:84%
but pretty much every technology
that we have at this point

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.900 align:middle line:84%
probably was given to us
by someone else before,

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.270 align:middle line:84%
or at least some component of it
was given to us by someone else

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.460 align:middle line:84%
before we could
develop it ourselves.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I agree that most
technology that we have

00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:58.820 align:middle line:90%
on the planet--

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.050 align:middle line:90%
we're just not that smart.

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Most.

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:01.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, most.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Now we talked about
these cool weapons,

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:09.230 align:middle line:84%
we talked about utilizing rifles
and plasma rifles and railguns,

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:12.800 align:middle line:84%
but how about hand-to-hand
combat weapons?

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever see any
special knives or swords?

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:17.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were
certainly trained

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:21.500 align:middle line:84%
in all hand-to-hand
weapons, all melee weapons.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.140 align:middle line:84%
We used to use something
called the personal utility

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.320 align:middle line:84%
tool or the putter,
which is basically

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.560 align:middle line:84%
a very heavy handle
with a blade on it

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.450 align:middle line:84%
that's like a reverse guillotine
blade made out of some alloy.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:39.110 align:middle line:84%
So you can hit somebody in
the head with it like an ax

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:41.420 align:middle line:84%
or slice off body
parts, and it's

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:44.630 align:middle line:84%
got a spike on the
palm and a spike

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.340 align:middle line:84%
on the back of the
top of the head of it.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.710 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very vicious.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Sounds very brutal.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very brutal.

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:56.330 align:middle line:84%
In the hand of an exosuit
with that extra hydraulics

00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:00.740 align:middle line:84%
in your muscles, you can take
limbs off, and it's brutal.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Makes a lot of crunching noises.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>> What about chemically
propelled weapons?

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>> There are species
that still use them.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.790 align:middle line:84%
We don't typically
use them anymore

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.180 align:middle line:84%
because they're just
less effective than all

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.180 align:middle line:90%
the other tools we have.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.280 align:middle line:84%
But we've encountered species
who are still using chemically

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.420 align:middle line:90%
propelled weapons.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about the weapons
that you have encountered that

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.320 align:middle line:90%
are not human.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably one of the more
interesting and common weapons

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:29.450 align:middle line:84%
is what we consider a low-grade
plasma gun or plasma weapon,

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:31.370 align:middle line:90%
which is like a lightning gun.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.355 align:middle line:84%
So it shoots a
beam, a plasma beam,

00:20:33.355 --> 00:20:35.105 align:middle line:84%
which is like a lightning
bolt, basically,

00:20:35.105 --> 00:20:36.440 align:middle line:90%
out of the end of it.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.920 align:middle line:90%
That's actually fairly common.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.628 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
species that use them.

00:20:39.628 --> 00:20:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Turns out they're really
easy to make and have

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.810 align:middle line:90%
a very low failure rate.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you think ETs know
how our bodies would respond

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:49.770 align:middle line:90%
to the weapons that they make?

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:50.570 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:55.083 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk about
gases, viruses, bacterias.

00:20:55.083 --> 00:20:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure, and probably
the same way that we do,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.300 align:middle line:84%
by testing them on biological
entities that we want to test

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.440 align:middle line:90%
that stuff onto.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to engineer
a virus, or bacteria,

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.730 align:middle line:84%
or gaseous substance that's
specific towards a certain

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.190 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
biological form,

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:84%
or if we have some
general knowledge

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.740 align:middle line:84%
about general biological
forms and we come up

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:23.070 align:middle line:84%
with a biological species that
matches one of the templates,

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.200 align:middle line:84%
then we can start
from there instead

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.210 align:middle line:90%
of starting from square one.

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.400 align:middle line:84%
But we absolutely
have the ability

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:37.440 align:middle line:84%
to design these tools for
mass, mass, mass combat.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:42.930 align:middle line:84%
So when we feel like we have
to use mass-extinction weapons,

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:46.650 align:middle line:84%
use weapons of mass
destruction, then we will.

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:49.740 align:middle line:84%
It is a preference
more than anything

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.920 align:middle line:84%
else because the
use of these tools

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:57.580 align:middle line:84%
often causes more harm and
more death than you want.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And there are
intergalactic bodies

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.030 align:middle line:90%
who can investigate war crimes.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And so we know that if we
handicap ourselves a little bit

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and don't do the maximum damage
that we could possibly do--

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.750 align:middle line:84%
because we're very
good at that--

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.930 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
be less likely to come

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.970 align:middle line:84%
into legal entanglements
later and have

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.400 align:middle line:84%
to answer to some sort
of intergalactic tribunal

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.800 align:middle line:84%
on war crimes or something
like that as long

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:29.140 align:middle line:84%
as we behave ourselves according
to certain acceptable rules

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.510 align:middle line:90%
of engagement.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Why are these weapons not
fine-tuned so we don't take out

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:38.560 align:middle line:84%
extra buildings,
extra innocent beings?

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.670 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like we should
have that type of technology.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, sometimes we do.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes that's an option, but
sometimes it's not an option.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, shielding around
facilities and buildings

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:53.950 align:middle line:84%
makes it difficult to
use weaponry from ships.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:57.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have destroyers
that can fire giant particle

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.790 align:middle line:84%
beams from space,
and giant missiles

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and torpedoes from space,
and quantum bombs and things.

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.050 align:middle line:90%
We do have those abilities.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.320 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they're
not always an option,

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.920 align:middle line:84%
nor again are they
always preferred.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of those things
where, probably like we should,

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:16.550 align:middle line:84%
we only use them when
they're really necessary.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:20.380 align:middle line:84%
We would rather send in
a small group of people

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:26.050 align:middle line:84%
to do something very efficiently
than do something that's kills

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:27.290 align:middle line:90%
off a lot of people.

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It's based off
of the mission.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Pretty much.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Each mission is different.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and we understand
that, as a warrior species--

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:35.800 align:middle line:90%
because we are.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Our military leaders
have accepted

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.460 align:middle line:84%
that among the
intergalactic community

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.080 align:middle line:90%
we're a warrior species.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.828 align:middle line:84%
We like conflict,
and we like fighting

00:23:43.828 --> 00:23:46.120 align:middle line:84%
more than some other species
do, and we're better at it

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.538 align:middle line:90%
than some other species.

00:23:47.538 --> 00:23:49.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's understood and
accepted that that's

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.205 align:middle line:84%
what we're going to
spend quite a bit of time

00:23:51.205 --> 00:23:52.990 align:middle line:84%
doing because that's
what we're good at.

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.170 align:middle line:84%
But we also see through
the intergalactic community

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:59.350 align:middle line:84%
that warrior species can end
up with different reputations

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.630 align:middle line:84%
depending on how they
go about their business.

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And from looking
at other species,

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.660 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to have
a bad reputation.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So we believe that
measured responses

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.000 align:middle line:84%
make it more clear that
we're not barbarians

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.680 align:middle line:84%
when we engage in
military conflict,

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.200 align:middle line:84%
that we're not just hitting
people on the head with clubs

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and killing as many
people as possible

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:84%
like thugs and barbarians,
that we're being strategic,

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.230 align:middle line:84%
surgical, precise
whenever possible.

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they know
we're from Earth?

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.570 align:middle line:90%
Do they know you're from Earth?

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Sometimes.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.320 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes no.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.390 align:middle line:90%
It really depends.

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:41.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're another
species on another planet,

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:46.165 align:middle line:84%
and soldiers in exosuits that
are using active camouflage

00:24:46.165 --> 00:24:47.540 align:middle line:84%
so they're
essentially invisible,

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and you can't see them,
and you don't know what

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:52.130 align:middle line:84%
the technology is, and you're
not sure where they're from,

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.710 align:middle line:84%
that's as mysterious
as anything could be.

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.860 align:middle line:84%
It might take some time to
figure out, who was that?

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.790 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.970 align:middle line:84%
But if they don't have
any previous experience

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.040 align:middle line:84%
or they haven't
heard the rumors,

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.200 align:middle line:84%
then they might not
know who it is at first.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> How does that
camouflage work?

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's a few
different methodologies.

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:16.160 align:middle line:84%
The older technology
basically uses

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.360 align:middle line:84%
a projector that projects an
image of what's behind you.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So it uses a lot of
little mini-cameras

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.520 align:middle line:84%
on 360 degrees on
the suit with a lot

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.440 align:middle line:90%
of little mini-projectors.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.140 align:middle line:84%
So these little projecting
cameras and screens

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.100 align:middle line:90%
are very, very tiny.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And they're all linked
together so that, essentially,

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.380 align:middle line:84%
when someone's looking
at you, they're

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.850 align:middle line:84%
seeing what's behind you,
now, not in a perfect way--

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:41.660 align:middle line:90%
pretty good.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.860 align:middle line:90%
We sort of think of it as--

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.350 align:middle line:84%
There's probably a franchise
that I can't use by name.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>> But we've all seen the sort
of invisible that you can kind

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:52.880 align:middle line:90%
of see.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.770 align:middle line:84%
So that would be the
older active camouflage.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:59.120 align:middle line:84%
We have some newer stuff
that if I was wearing that,

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.665 align:middle line:84%
I could potentially walk through
the room with people around,

00:26:02.665 --> 00:26:04.790 align:middle line:84%
and they wouldn't even know
that I was in the room.

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:06.332 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't even
be able to see me.

00:26:06.332 --> 00:26:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're bending photons
and light around yourself.

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep, absolutely.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, projecting different
light fields so that what

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:84%
someone is seeing
is not what's there.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:25.130 align:middle line:84%
How about when you're in
the solar system of these--

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:29.030 align:middle line:84%
visiting on these
contract jobs, and you

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:31.520 align:middle line:90%
do get discovered, your craft?

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, have ever been attacked
like in craft to craft?

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean like
in space to space?

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:43.520 align:middle line:84%
We've gotten to broad
sites, boarding parties.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, yeah, it can happen.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.053 align:middle line:90%
It can get really hairy.

00:26:46.053 --> 00:26:46.970 align:middle line:90%
It can totally happen.

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So you've had firefights
using these weapons

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.890 align:middle line:90%
on your craft?

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:53.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And how does this not
damage the hull of the craft?

00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm not
saying that it doesn't.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Damage control is
damage control.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.760 align:middle line:84%
When you pop holes in the
hull, you fix them later.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.310 align:middle line:84%
You have certain systems
that can engage automatically

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:11.330 align:middle line:84%
to protect from pressure
loss, gaseous loss.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to go around
and fully repair them later on,

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.070 align:middle line:90%
but it happens.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any craft that have
defensive shields that block

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.720 align:middle line:84%
from anyone
teletransporting on or--

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>> --block from a
missile coming in?

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:29.900 align:middle line:84%
The important
thing to understand

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:33.230 align:middle line:84%
about such technology
is, so far, we

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.900 align:middle line:84%
have not come to an
understanding of something

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.810 align:middle line:84%
that is an ultimate defense
or an ultimate attack.

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:41.600 align:middle line:90%
So you have levels.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.240 align:middle line:84%
We may have a
defense that's here.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.790 align:middle line:84%
So anything that's
attacking here below

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.030 align:middle line:90%
will not get past that.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.680 align:middle line:84%
But if something can
be considered here,

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.728 align:middle line:84%
well, then that's
overcoming the defense,

00:27:53.728 --> 00:27:55.520 align:middle line:84%
and you need your
defense to go up to here.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.312 align:middle line:84%
So there's this constant
process that we're

00:27:57.312 --> 00:27:59.870 align:middle line:84%
going through that is every time
we come up against something

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:03.500 align:middle line:84%
that's stronger than what we
came up with before, well,

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.990 align:middle line:84%
then we adapt and come up
with better shielding, better

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.780 align:middle line:84%
defense technology to
defend against that thing.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.150 align:middle line:84%
So we're in a constant
upgrading process.

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they have special weapons
for on-craft battles that do

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.870 align:middle line:90%
not damage the craft?

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I mean--

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It only damages
organic material,

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:24.020 align:middle line:90%
like a human or another being?

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Plasma swords.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't use other
terminology, again, copyrighted

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:35.240 align:middle line:84%
terminology, but essentially,
a sword that's a plasma torch.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.332 align:middle line:84%
That cuts through
organic tissue real well.

00:28:38.332 --> 00:28:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And if it's set at
the right temperature,

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.350 align:middle line:84%
then it won't do-- it will
only do minor damage when

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:43.150 align:middle line:90%
it hits the hull.

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>> What about if you dropped
it, and it hit your leg?

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Is there a safety thing on it
that it can't-- you can't hurt

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:49.910 align:middle line:90%
yourself?

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.840 align:middle line:84%
You can cut off your
own limbs with them.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.150 align:middle line:90%
It's happened.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And when that
happens, do you guys--

00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.480 align:middle line:90%
what do you do?

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.250 align:middle line:84%
You take them to the
med bay and put them

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.230 align:middle line:90%
inside that 3D printer?

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, we-- again, we
use mostly these holographic

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.760 align:middle line:90%
regenerators.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.090 align:middle line:84%
So you put someone in a holobed,
and it regenerates the leg,

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:12.100 align:middle line:90%
build them a new leg.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:12.900 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.350 align:middle line:90%
It's happened to me.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:19.035 align:middle line:84%
>> Are the weapons you were
exposed to, can they actually--

00:29:19.035 --> 00:29:20.280 align:middle line:90%
is there antidotes?

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:23.305 align:middle line:84%
Can they-- is there something
to heal you from that if you

00:29:23.305 --> 00:29:24.105 align:middle line:90%
were--

00:29:24.105 --> 00:29:26.844 align:middle line:90%


00:29:26.844 --> 00:29:28.777 align:middle line:90%
sustained an injury from them?

00:29:28.777 --> 00:29:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, not really in the suit.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.610 align:middle line:90%
We have onboard tourniquets.

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And, well, and a
plasma torch will

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.180 align:middle line:90%
cauterize the wound itself.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.660 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty handy.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.310 align:middle line:84%
But there is
nothing in this suit

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:46.460 align:middle line:84%
that would repair
cutting something off

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.830 align:middle line:90%
with a heated plasma torch.

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.180 align:middle line:90%
It's just going to--

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.110 align:middle line:90%
bye, tissue.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:52.070 align:middle line:90%
Bye-bye.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to regenerate
it, make some new stuff.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>> If we used a plasma
weapon on each other,

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.660 align:middle line:84%
do we have something to
regenerate that wound?

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:02.362 align:middle line:90%
We can fix anything.

00:30:02.362 --> 00:30:04.070 align:middle line:84%
We have the technology
that can literally

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:08.120 align:middle line:84%
fix anything, any
amount of damage,

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.420 align:middle line:84%
any amount of percentage of
body-tissue damage anywhere.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that the
holographic beds--

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>> --you speak of?

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.180 align:middle line:84%
That's at least the
quickest, most efficient

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.120 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever used.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>> When is humanity
going to see these beds?

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.605 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's a good question.

00:30:24.605 --> 00:30:29.960 align:middle line:84%
I do have a chief
engineer and a CFO.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And we have put
together a small startup

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:36.452 align:middle line:84%
to get the funding
to begin the process,

00:30:36.452 --> 00:30:37.910 align:middle line:84%
to do the research
and development,

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:41.210 align:middle line:84%
to build the components,
to replicate terrestrial

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:43.160 align:middle line:84%
technology in the
civilian world.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:48.140 align:middle line:84%
We think from starting
point to prototype

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:49.833 align:middle line:90%
is three to five years.

00:30:49.833 --> 00:30:52.250 align:middle line:84%
There is some conversation
I've heard other people talking

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:55.250 align:middle line:84%
about, some of
these technologies

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:59.220 align:middle line:84%
or similar technologies that
are going to come out next year.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that's happening.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:06.230 align:middle line:84%
But we would think
that with the funding

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:08.570 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
to get-- and this

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:10.670 align:middle line:84%
is something we've been
working on for years,

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:13.730 align:middle line:84%
and my CFO has been giving
me a lot of confidence

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:16.880 align:middle line:84%
that we should have our
startup funding sometime

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.310 align:middle line:84%
this year so we can
begin the process soon.

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to think a prototype
in three to five years.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:25.020 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to think a
commercial product within 10.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Those are conservative
estimates.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:29.978 align:middle line:84%
As Buckminster Fuller said, if
you want to change something--

00:31:29.978 --> 00:31:31.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to paraphrase
here-- if you

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.145 align:middle line:84%
want to change the world, if you
want to make something better,

00:31:34.145 --> 00:31:36.740 align:middle line:84%
you don't just say,
let's do it this way.

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.270 align:middle line:90%
You create a better option.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.410 align:middle line:90%
You create a better method.

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:42.170 align:middle line:84%
You create a better
tool and then wait

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:44.900 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of the world
to adapt and pick up.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Because if you make something
that's more cost-effective

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and works better than any
other technology that you have,

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:55.310 align:middle line:84%
well, the marketplace is
going to eventually want that.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:58.640 align:middle line:84%
So if you lost your arm,
it would be cheaper for me

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.410 align:middle line:84%
to put you in a holobed
and regrow your arm

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:03.290 align:middle line:84%
than it would be actually
to design a custom

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:04.240 align:middle line:90%
prosthetic for you.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.700 align:middle line:90%
It would actually be cheaper.

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So once you demonstrate that
you have something better,

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:12.980 align:middle line:84%
that it's more cost-effective,
that it's more efficient,

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.730 align:middle line:84%
people will just
eventually switch.

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So we think that
there-- we don't--

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:19.080 align:middle line:84%
not saying there's not going to
be some uphill struggle there.

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.260 align:middle line:84%
But we think, in
the end, the tool

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:24.065 align:middle line:84%
itself wins because it's
better than the other tools

00:32:24.065 --> 00:32:24.865 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:32:24.865 --> 00:32:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I 100% agree.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And I've, of course, experienced
that with a lot of my devices

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.580 align:middle line:84%
that I have invented that I
was shunned for for years.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> But once they saw that
it worked and you make it

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.380 align:middle line:90%
cost-effective--

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.480 align:middle line:84%
so I think you're on a
great trajectory for that.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you see humankind and
our allies moving more towards

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.130 align:middle line:90%
peace?

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just getting ready
for some sort of perpetual war?

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can tell you what
the goal of the military at this

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.520 align:middle line:90%
time is.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:59.810 align:middle line:84%
The military understands
that without conflict, they

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.480 align:middle line:84%
have no purpose,
which has been part

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.330 align:middle line:84%
of the problem for
the last 100 years

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:08.150 align:middle line:84%
that we have to keep things
going, keep conflicts going.

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Because if we
don't, then they'll

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:13.280 align:middle line:84%
just cease to exist and go away,
and that's not what we want.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>> And there's money to be made.

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:15.993 align:middle line:90%
>> And there's money to be made.

00:33:15.993 --> 00:33:18.380 align:middle line:84%
But we also are seeing
the long-term benefits

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:22.175 align:middle line:84%
of having a strong defense and
that to have a strong defense,

00:33:22.175 --> 00:33:24.050 align:middle line:84%
you have to keep going,
and going, and going.

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we'd like
to see though is

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:27.980 align:middle line:84%
we would like to see
military conflict

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.650 align:middle line:90%
on planet Earth come to zero.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:31.520 align:middle line:90%
We'd like that.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.340 align:middle line:84%
We would like to see that
human beings on planet Earth

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.760 align:middle line:84%
no longer fight, kill, use
weapons of destruction and mass

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.160 align:middle line:84%
destruction against each
other to solve conflicts.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.740 align:middle line:84%
We would like to take all
of our military technology

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.720 align:middle line:90%
and focus it outside.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.690 align:middle line:84%
We think if we're focusing
it outside of our own planet,

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:49.640 align:middle line:84%
then we don't have to
live that way here.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:54.260 align:middle line:84%
We can take that
perpetual necessity away

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:57.320 align:middle line:84%
from the planetary function,
and we can move it outward.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.320 align:middle line:90%
Because let's just be honest.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Now that we're in the
intergalactic community,

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:06.230 align:middle line:84%
the potential of military
threats are near limitless.

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.090 align:middle line:84%
The potential of
military threats

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:10.610 align:middle line:84%
that are stronger and
more capable than what

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:13.114 align:middle line:84%
we can do currently today
are near limitless as we

00:34:13.114 --> 00:34:14.239 align:middle line:90%
go farther and farther out.

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So the need to continue
to develop a strong space

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:23.840 align:middle line:84%
military force is going to be
necessary for the next 10,000

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.780 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.750 align:middle line:90%
So that's just the way it is.

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:29.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people want to
call that "perpetual war."

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.090 align:middle line:84%
I call that
"perpetual necessity."

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you feel more pessimistic
or optimistic about where

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:36.160 align:middle line:90%
humanity is going?

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Both.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.139 align:middle line:84%
I think that we are
currently moving

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:41.960 align:middle line:84%
toward some things that
are going to get worse

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.409 align:middle line:90%
before they get better.

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:47.960 align:middle line:84%
But the arc towards improvement
I think is well planned out.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So these aren't surprises
that are coming up.

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:52.489 align:middle line:90%
We're like, oh, what do we do?

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:58.550 align:middle line:84%
These are knowns that we know
are sort of inevitably coming.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:59.878 align:middle line:90%
The bill is coming due.

00:34:59.878 --> 00:35:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Just a matter of time.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the bill is
coming due on some things.

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And we know there's going to
be some changes with that,

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:06.092 align:middle line:84%
and we think that
there's going to be

00:35:06.092 --> 00:35:11.280 align:middle line:84%
some moments in both domestic
and international conflict

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.040 align:middle line:84%
which is going to increase
before it gets better.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:19.230 align:middle line:84%
But we are also looking at a
trajectory where in the next--

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:20.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go on a limb.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, in
the next decade,

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:26.100 align:middle line:84%
the goal is to get
past all of that

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and stop fighting
amongst ourselves.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:33.490 align:middle line:84%
So fingers crossed that it
actually works out that way.

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:36.910 align:middle line:84%
But I think we're-- it's going
to get a little uglier first.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:39.490 align:middle line:84%
But I think we have a
plan and a trajectory

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:45.150 align:middle line:84%
to make it all work out so that
there's rainbows, and sunshine,

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.560 align:middle line:90%
and puppies for everybody.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Randy, do you believe of any
benevolent ETs out there that

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:52.390 align:middle line:84%
can actually affect
us spiritually?

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, sure.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:59.250 align:middle line:84%
If I'm just to go by the reports
that we are hearing, I mean,

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.710 align:middle line:84%
hundreds, hundreds
of species who

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:06.300 align:middle line:84%
seem to be directly involved
in human terrestrial, spiritual

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.667 align:middle line:84%
evolution and the spiritual
evolution of other species,

00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:11.250 align:middle line:84%
like that's what
they do all day long.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Where are they?

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of them are either
operating out of phase

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:18.810 align:middle line:84%
or in multidimensional,
interdimensional places

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:23.480 align:middle line:84%
because it's safer for
them to work that way.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And that way, what
they really want to do

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.430 align:middle line:90%
is work person to person.

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:29.820 align:middle line:84%
These are the species
who would rather

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.580 align:middle line:84%
identify an individual or
a number of individuals

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and work with them one
on one than try and, say,

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:39.190 align:middle line:84%
mass communicate or
mass educate people.

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:42.420 align:middle line:84%
So by not engaging
necessarily with us

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.630 align:middle line:84%
in a physical,
biological manner,

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:48.660 align:middle line:84%
they can accomplish that
task much more easily

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.030 align:middle line:84%
without scaring people,
or freaking people out,

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:54.910 align:middle line:84%
or endangering themselves or
others by being physically

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:55.710 align:middle line:90%
present with us.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.918 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the majority
of them seem to operate.

00:36:57.918 --> 00:37:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So these are benevolent
ETs that don't need weapons.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>> They have evolved to a place
where their ability to defend

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:09.270 align:middle line:84%
themselves is such
that they don't.

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:10.890 align:middle line:84%
There are species
who have evolved

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:16.080 align:middle line:84%
to a place where if a fleet
of 10,000 destroyer ships

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.230 align:middle line:84%
came to their planet, they would
just shift their planet out

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:21.480 align:middle line:84%
of phase so that
those ships wouldn't

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.620 align:middle line:90%
be able to affect them.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:26.460 align:middle line:84%
There's some pretty
advanced defenses

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.470 align:middle line:84%
that once you achieve
that level, yeah,

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:32.400 align:middle line:84%
you don't need a military so
much anymore because you're not

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.970 align:middle line:84%
fighting force on force,
numbers on numbers.

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:38.070 align:middle line:84%
You just have the
ability to say, well,

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:42.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just make it so you
can't touch my planet, period.

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:46.843 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's just phasing in
and out of different dimensions

00:37:46.843 --> 00:37:48.010 align:middle line:90%
and reality, a whole planet?

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep, yep, whole planet.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you seen this phasing
in and out of a defense system

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.490 align:middle line:90%
that protects an entire planet?

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And is that something
we're going to have?

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.532 align:middle line:84%
>> I haven't seen it,
a whole planet do it.

00:38:01.532 --> 00:38:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I've heard about it
and read the reports.

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.930 align:middle line:90%
I've seen a space station do it.

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:07.710 align:middle line:84%
I've seen an entire space
station blink out of phase

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:09.120 align:middle line:90%
so that it can't be attacked.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you talking about a moon
space station or a small space

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:12.780 align:middle line:90%
station?

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Like a big, floating
space station in space.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:21.942 align:middle line:84%
That would be the equivalent of
as big or bigger than Manhattan

00:38:21.942 --> 00:38:23.400 align:middle line:84%
or something like
that, pretty big.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And for the audience,
how does that scientifically

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:26.970 align:middle line:90%
happen?

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>> The molecules in your
body have a quantum frequency

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:33.780 align:middle line:84%
to them that tells you what
dimension or frequency that

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.920 align:middle line:84%
you're in, what
timespace you live in.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
field that can alter

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:40.890 align:middle line:84%
the frequency of every
molecule in an object,

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:44.490 align:middle line:84%
you can shift that object
to any other phase.

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very finely
tuned sort of modulation.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.430 align:middle line:84%
So you can tune yourself
to a coded frequency

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:56.070 align:middle line:84%
that someone else is like, well,
we know they're out of phase,

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:58.920 align:middle line:84%
but we can't figure out what
their exact frequency is,

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.160 align:middle line:84%
so we can't exactly interact
with them physically.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Then it makes it a process of
the enemy trying to figure out

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:07.450 align:middle line:90%
what the actual frequency is.

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And there are species who have
such advanced systems that they

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:14.830 align:middle line:84%
can rotate that
frequency very quickly.

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a species
with the technology that can

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:20.150 align:middle line:90%
rotate that quantum signature--

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.110 align:middle line:84%
oh, I don't know--
every half a second,

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:24.120 align:middle line:84%
that makes it almost
impossible to figure out

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.560 align:middle line:90%
what the frequency is.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I explain that sometimes
to my students, like a TV set,

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:32.220 align:middle line:90%
and on channel 1, you're here.

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And channel 2, you're
somewhere else.

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>> However, is there a species
out there that can track me

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:40.690 align:middle line:90%
to channel 2?

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yeah.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.790 align:middle line:84%
But those species tend to
be more advanced and not

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:45.690 align:middle line:90%
militaristic.

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:47.760 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
things we don't bother

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.820 align:middle line:84%
defending against at this point
because the people who have it

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.560 align:middle line:84%
aren't going to
attack us with it.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.860 align:middle line:84%
So we're not worried about
those things so much yet.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And what do you think
about the universe,

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:02.190 align:middle line:84%
this universe and this dimension
as itself, as a frequency,

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:04.380 align:middle line:90%
and can it also shift?

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>> From what I have been told as
far as I understand the physics

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.440 align:middle line:90%
of that, in theory, yes.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:15.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that it has or
if someone has the ability

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:16.090 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:20.730 align:middle line:84%
But in the same way that
Nikola Tesla theorized

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:24.390 align:middle line:84%
if you created a vibration
against the planet,

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:26.610 align:middle line:84%
you could shake the
whole planet apart;

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:28.080 align:middle line:84%
if you had a lever
big enough, you

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.900 align:middle line:84%
could move the whole planet;
these are theoretical things

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.820 align:middle line:84%
that, in theory, they
should be correct.

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.515 align:middle line:84%
So in theory, that
should be correct,

00:40:35.515 --> 00:40:37.890 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know anyone who's
ever tested it to prove it.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:40.015 align:middle line:84%
>> Randy, thank you so much
for coming on the show.

00:40:40.015 --> 00:40:41.575 align:middle line:84%
That was fascinating
information.

00:40:41.575 --> 00:40:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for having me.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:46.780 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
