00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.370 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today on Cosmic
Disclosure, we're with Tim,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.840 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor in the
covert governance in Germany

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.410 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies in relation

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.740 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial groups
in contact with Earth.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.568 align:middle line:90%
Tim, thanks for joining.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you for having me.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Today we
want to talk about how

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.460 align:middle line:84%
language is correlated
into source and time.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.470 align:middle line:90%
What's your thoughts on that?

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Languages are
a super important way

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:84%
to maneuver yourself through
the experience of reality.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.610 align:middle line:84%
That is basically something
or the main reason

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.530 align:middle line:90%
why there are languages.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.230 align:middle line:84%
We know that many archaic
texts from all over the world,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.310 align:middle line:84%
they all say in the
beginning there was sound

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.770 align:middle line:84%
or there was the
word or something.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And there is a lot
of truth to that.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.000 align:middle line:84%
There are versions of a universe
that only consist of sound

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.640 align:middle line:84%
as just the way this version of
the universe consists of light.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And those versions, they
overlap each other already.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.240 align:middle line:84%
So words and frequencies
of words and tones

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.630 align:middle line:84%
can be used and have been used
in order to maneuver yourself

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:90%
through reality.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Because 3D movement
is not the only way

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.910 align:middle line:90%
we can relocate ourselves.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.080 align:middle line:90%
There's much more to that.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And words can be used in order
to bring a cohesive thought

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.680 align:middle line:90%
into manifestation.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, and
that is something

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.539 align:middle line:84%
that is really heavy
on this planet.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.010 align:middle line:84%
There are two things that
make it a little challenging.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.890 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is the
languages of the Earth

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:84%
have systematically been
modified in order to bring

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.020 align:middle line:90%
chaos to that system.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Normally, it used
to be that languages

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.270 align:middle line:84%
are used in order to communicate
from a consciousness unit

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:90%
to the--

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.570 align:middle line:84%
we would call it all in German,
which means to the everything.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, whoever
put educational systems

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:58.120 align:middle line:84%
and language rules up on
the population of Earth,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.460 align:middle line:84%
they cheated a little bit
with the people of Earth

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.920 align:middle line:84%
and made it harder
in order to manifest.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.400 align:middle line:90%
That is a huge problem.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the sentences,
the words, and the way grammar

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.950 align:middle line:84%
works is modified in a way
to make it more challenging.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.430 align:middle line:84%
It's just as if you were moving
towards this kind of putty

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.980 align:middle line:84%
or something that
makes it really sticky.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And you need to
put a lot of effort

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.910 align:middle line:84%
in it in order to
elevate yourself.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Normally, that process
would be super easy.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:84%
There are realms of reality
where words are so precise, so

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.080 align:middle line:84%
precisely-connected to the
reality that those words

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:84%
automatically and instantly
will change your perception

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and the way you
perceive reality.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:90%
That is number one.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Number two is that compared
to other languages,

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.330 align:middle line:84%
we could, for example,
compare that to the language

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.470 align:middle line:84%
the Greys are using, those
languages are super complex.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:27.188 align:middle line:84%
And earthly languages tend to
be very close-minded and have--

00:04:27.188 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: --They're not precise?

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: They're not
precise, exactly.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So that's-- a lot of
perceptible experiences are

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.440 align:middle line:84%
very hard to describe
in earthly language.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.680 align:middle line:84%
The Greys, for example,
includes the position

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.590 align:middle line:90%
of time inside the language.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Those languages
are super precise.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.070 align:middle line:84%
They also include
different properties

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.310 align:middle line:84%
into their own words
and their languages.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And that makes it
super, super precise,

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:09.368 align:middle line:84%
just because they are a super
mental and cognitive race.

00:05:09.368 --> 00:05:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Probably speeds
up their communications,

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.242 align:middle line:84%
I would think, compared
to the language here--

00:05:14.242 --> 00:05:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and all the languages
here on Earth

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.990 align:middle line:90%
are very discombobulating.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: That's true.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.400 align:middle line:84%
So the German language for
example is modified in a way

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.090 align:middle line:84%
that pretty much everything
that could be healthy and good

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.700 align:middle line:90%
is negated.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.710 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking
about entertainment,

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:84%
for example, the
German word for that

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.930 align:middle line:84%
is "Unterhaltung,"
which actually

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.120 align:middle line:90%
means to hold someone down--

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.940 align:middle line:90%
"unter," "haltung," hold down.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.080 align:middle line:84%
So that describes
that entertainment

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.300 align:middle line:84%
is being used in order to hold
people down from something.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.030 align:middle line:84%
We have different other
examples for that.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So if someone sneezes,
you say bless you.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.280 align:middle line:90%
In Germany, they say Gesundheit.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Gesundheit.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And the first
syllable, ge, means go.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:90%
That means like go away.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.100 align:middle line:90%
So you're actually giving--

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.110 align:middle line:84%
so you mean to say be healthy
or something-- like "Heilung"

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.570 align:middle line:84%
would be a very
positive word for that.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.990 align:middle line:84%
But Gesundheit sanity
means sundheit, sanity.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.920 align:middle line:90%
But go and ge means go away.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.850 align:middle line:84%
So that is something that people
have been taught upon in order

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.530 align:middle line:90%
to say that to each other.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's so automatically--
no one thinks about it.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like you say,
bless you, bless you.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And you wish something
into the universe

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.790 align:middle line:90%
that is not directly your wish.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Because what you want
to do is actually

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.470 align:middle line:90%
to wish somebody health.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: How is that negated?

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.120 align:middle line:90%
Who was responsible for that?

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Who, that's a
interesting question.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.550 align:middle line:90%
Who did that?

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.350 align:middle line:90%
Somebody.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.830 align:middle line:84%
So the Greys are
accusing someone.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.280 align:middle line:84%
I know that people
who looked into that

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.050 align:middle line:84%
are accusing somebody,
some foreign force.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.310 align:middle line:90%
I cannot say that.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if it's true.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I know somebody put
that into place.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:29.570 align:middle line:84%
So whoever put up the
educational system

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and even went into different
other parts of the world,

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:40.490 align:middle line:84%
invaded them, and then put
missionary educational systems

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:46.490 align:middle line:84%
and languages to those
barbaric, uneducated people,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:51.020 align:middle line:84%
they might be cheated
in the first place

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.310 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring languages
and distortion of languages

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.500 align:middle line:84%
to other tribes in
the world, which

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.960 align:middle line:84%
is super effective but
also super malevolent.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So who do you
believe was the master who

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:90%
came up with these languages?

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: In the first
place, languages

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.030 align:middle line:84%
were pretty close
to source itself.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:19.430 align:middle line:84%
But we see that there had been
some kind of modification,

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.680 align:middle line:84%
manipulation on the
system of language.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Whoever did that was
doing it intentionally

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:31.380 align:middle line:84%
in order to prevent humans
from evolving too quickly.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:90%
And whoever did that--

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:38.419 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not saying who that
was, because I don't know that--

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.730 align:middle line:90%
but someone did it.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And whoever did that was a very
elevated and high intelligence

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.180 align:middle line:84%
and must have known the
languages of Earth a lot.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And we see that in
English as well.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.990 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of Latin words
have been integrated

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:04.760 align:middle line:90%
into the English language.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And people have been taught
to use those Latin words.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:84%
But those Latin words sometimes
have the similar effect.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:18.410 align:middle line:84%
So we were talking, for example,
about the word future, which

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:25.850 align:middle line:84%
means basically is coming from
the Latin word futura, which

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:30.390 align:middle line:90%
consists of two different words.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:37.850 align:middle line:84%
The first part of it is fu,
which means fu like bad.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And tura is something
that derives

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:47.690 align:middle line:84%
from a Latin word that means
to manifest by using incense.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:84%
So different species
or different tribes

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.880 align:middle line:84%
have used different
techniques in order

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:84%
to connect to the
universe in order

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.910 align:middle line:84%
to connect with source
and to manifest things.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.390 align:middle line:84%
For example, Germans,
the original word

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:11.180 align:middle line:84%
for power in the Indo-Germanic
original language

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.910 align:middle line:84%
is the same word
for forest today.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So German people
or Germanic people

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.490 align:middle line:84%
have seen the power
of trees and nature

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and have used that
by their connection

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.250 align:middle line:84%
to nature in order to manifest
and to connect to source.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.330 align:middle line:90%
Roman people were different.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.050 align:middle line:84%
They were using a lot
of incense in order

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:37.100 align:middle line:84%
to have smoke and use
the smoke to bring focus

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.170 align:middle line:84%
into that and to
manifest things.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So the second part
of the word future

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:47.750 align:middle line:84%
is basically meaning
manifesting something

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.280 align:middle line:90%
through using incense.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.410 align:middle line:84%
But in combination, future
actually means bad luck.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.950 align:middle line:84%
So everyone who is
bringing something

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.790 align:middle line:84%
from the future or something
I have that and this wish

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and that is his or
her future, basically

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.240 align:middle line:84%
is miscommunicating with
the universe in itself.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:84%
The universe then,
as a life form,

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.440 align:middle line:84%
doesn't exactly know what
you're talking about.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Because for the universe
there is no bad, no good.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:25.220 align:middle line:84%
It's only reality and
experience of the reality.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And the universe might give you
a bad feedback when you do not

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.530 align:middle line:90%
communicate correctly.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When did you
think this all changed?

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we just keep
Sanskrit, this ancient language?

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Because from there to all
these other languages,

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.920 align:middle line:84%
which is big gap in
time, and when do you

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.720 align:middle line:90%
think that time was?

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So we think that
the originator languages

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:84%
or the original
languages that were--

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:84%
and you have those
stories that those

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:05.020 align:middle line:84%
are coming from
source or something,

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.540 align:middle line:90%
that those languages are lost.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.980 align:middle line:84%
No one knows where
they got lost.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:18.900 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, someone or
something made people on Earth

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.770 align:middle line:84%
use a modified version
of their own language.

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Sanskrit is the only
language that has

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.890 align:middle line:90%
connections to source itself.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.940 align:middle line:90%
And that still remains.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.100 align:middle line:90%
It's the only one left.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Everyone, everything else
mysteriously disappeared.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.990 align:middle line:84%
But we see in the
history of humanity,

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
a systematic modification
of languages.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And also, whoever did that and
brought that upon this planet,

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:02.130 align:middle line:84%
they were using a specifica
of ape races, which

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:06.840 align:middle line:84%
is coming from their
tendency to be connected

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.030 align:middle line:90%
in tribes or in hoards.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And in hoards you need to
stick to a common set of rules.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:20.370 align:middle line:84%
That is giving from one
to another generation

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.070 align:middle line:90%
and stick to that very closely.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.420 align:middle line:90%
They rely on that.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.400 align:middle line:84%
They need that in
order to be successful.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:32.430 align:middle line:84%
So that behaviorism is
still inside of humanity.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:39.510 align:middle line:84%
If you expose someone
to a rule or a mindset,

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:84%
so an intelligent, it's
called contaminated.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:84%
That is a contaminated
generation

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:84%
that will go on with
that contaminated thought

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.100 align:middle line:84%
until someone else brings in
an opposing thought, which

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.420 align:middle line:84%
is mainly re-habituating
or re-educating

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.530 align:middle line:90%
that previous generation.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.870 align:middle line:90%
So if you tell--

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:08.100 align:middle line:84%
and this is pretty much
what everyone on this planet

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.080 align:middle line:90%
has experienced--

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:15.540 align:middle line:84%
you cannot argue with other
members of this ape species,

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:20.190 align:middle line:84%
even if they are super wrong,
even if you give them evidence

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:26.110 align:middle line:84%
or proof even, they will still
stick to what has been educated

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:26.910 align:middle line:90%
upon them.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Because their ape genetics
is what tells them

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.620 align:middle line:84%
that it is very important
for the success of the hoard,

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.820 align:middle line:84%
of the tribe to stick to the
rule of the last generation.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Speaking of tribe,
you mentioned earlier

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.980 align:middle line:84%
about the Greys
and their language,

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.720 align:middle line:84%
how time and coordinates
is already incorporated

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.220 align:middle line:90%
into their language.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And here, there have been
ancient civilizations

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and Aboriginal tribes
here that don't

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.890 align:middle line:90%
use a past or present tense.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:08.310 align:middle line:84%
There are also tribes that
do not have a word for I

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:11.280 align:middle line:84%
and you, which is
very interesting.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Because they have still this
connected, unified mindset

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.310 align:middle line:90%
inside of their language.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think
that makes it easier

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.810 align:middle line:90%
or more difficult in language?

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It depends on
what you want to create

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.380 align:middle line:90%
and what you focus on.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:37.360 align:middle line:84%
So there's this theory
that I cannot be defined.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And I cannot be defined unless
it brings itself in opposition

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle line:90%
to a you.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:51.160 align:middle line:84%
That means everything that
is different to you is I.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: But I am you.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: True.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.220 align:middle line:90%
But you're still you.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So that is
a paradox, and it's

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:00.310 align:middle line:90%
a paradox in this universe.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.860 align:middle line:84%
If you do not have
a concept of an I,

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and there are species
that have no I,

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.330 align:middle line:84%
they tend to have a
collective memory system.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.870 align:middle line:84%
They have a different
perception of reality.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Why should they develop a
language that distinguishes

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:19.810 align:middle line:90%
or differentiates?

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's also sometimes
pretty hard to explain.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Because human people
sometimes ask me, Tim,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.620 align:middle line:84%
what's the name of--
what's their name?

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.620 align:middle line:84%
This is also something that's
inside of human language

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.800 align:middle line:84%
in order to differentiate
yourself from something else.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.070 align:middle line:90%
So this is Emery.

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's banana.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And in reality, it's all
that connected field.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And there is lots and
lots more properties

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.800 align:middle line:84%
to Emery and lots
more properties

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.130 align:middle line:84%
to banana than just calling
it banana and Emery.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:04.990 align:middle line:84%
So the language of the Greys is
using all those probabilities,

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:11.260 align:middle line:84%
all those different data
sets in their language

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.319 align:middle line:84%
in order to make
it more precise.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why have languages
lost their power here on Earth?

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Because
languages in itself

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.880 align:middle line:84%
they are used in
order to communicate

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:84%
between the consciousness
unit and the collective

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.180 align:middle line:90%
or the all, the everything.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And again, languages
have been modified here.

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:40.730 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that
has also happened

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:47.090 align:middle line:84%
is that because people have been
taught a modified, manipulated,

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and chaotic system
of languages, they

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:57.050 align:middle line:84%
have experienced a loss of
feedback, which is pretty

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.790 align:middle line:90%
important for the universe.

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Because everything is relying on
feedback mechanism, which means

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.800 align:middle line:90%
I do something.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And something brings
back a consequence.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.070 align:middle line:90%
And it can then adjust that.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:17.660 align:middle line:84%
But as people have used those
modified languages a lot,

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:23.540 align:middle line:84%
and I mean we could talk how
to unmodify that and build

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.360 align:middle line:84%
upon a new structure of
language the language that

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.990 align:middle line:84%
would be more benevolent
for your manifestation.

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:33.530 align:middle line:84%
But as people have used
their modified languages

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:40.070 align:middle line:84%
over the generations, they have
suffered a lot less feedback.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:44.930 align:middle line:84%
They have just felt that
it's not working anymore.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.030 align:middle line:90%
Like it used to work.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And with less feedback
from the universe,

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.220 align:middle line:84%
language becomes more
and more unimportant.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And that is what people have
experienced a lot, which

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.320 align:middle line:90%
is a good thing in a way.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the installation and
the modification of languages

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:09.530 align:middle line:84%
has never, ever been
so weak like it's now.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Because people do not
mean what they speak.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:14.810 align:middle line:90%
They just put out words.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And on the most basic
level of communication,

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:24.920 align:middle line:84%
this recipient and communicator
thing does the job.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.890 align:middle line:90%
But that's mostly it.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:32.570 align:middle line:84%
One thing that has
been very important

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:37.310 align:middle line:84%
is a cohesive
current thought that

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:42.330 align:middle line:84%
transports the message you're
giving out into the universe.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:49.190 align:middle line:84%
So the universe is on
different level of perception.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.095 align:middle line:90%
It's active on all those levels.

00:19:51.095 --> 00:19:54.440 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.490 align:middle line:84%
The more levels of the universe
you put into your language

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and into your coordination
and communication,

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:84%
the more powerful
the language becomes.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:08.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you only speak and
you have all those thoughts

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.110 align:middle line:84%
in your head that go in
two different directions

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and they are not focused, you
basically just put out sounds.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And people, they base
their whole communication

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.320 align:middle line:90%
upon sounds.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.760 align:middle line:90%
But that's not all.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.950 align:middle line:90%
Communication is much more.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And the more information you
can put into that, the more

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:32.870 align:middle line:90%
feedback you become.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:38.810 align:middle line:84%
So one thing that a lot
of species, especially

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:42.890 align:middle line:84%
when we look at humanoid species
on different planets, what

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:47.030 align:middle line:84%
they do, they connect
their thoughts

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:50.990 align:middle line:90%
very closely to the words.

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:58.470 align:middle line:84%
They also have a more
evolved language system,

00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:59.570 align:middle line:90%
which helps them.

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:06.410 align:middle line:84%
But bringing a cohesive current
thought connected to the sound

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:11.270 align:middle line:84%
you make is something
that communication--

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.490 align:middle line:90%
everything benefits from that.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:16.850 align:middle line:84%
You can feel that if
someone radiates truth,

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:20.240 align:middle line:90%
you can feel the truth.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.880 align:middle line:84%
You might even if
you phone someone,

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and that person is smiling,
you can feel that by the phone.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So that is something
that can only

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:84%
be explained if more
information is connected then--

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:84%
that can only be explained
if more information comes

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:90%
with it then only sound.

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It gives more energy.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Yeah, energy and
information and focus.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.210 align:middle line:90%
Understood.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.790 align:middle line:84%
We hear a lot about
extraterrestrials

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:57.410 align:middle line:84%
using telepathy as a
way of communicating.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Is that something that
you're aware of or are they

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.330 align:middle line:90%
all just using sound?

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, telepathy
is another wave pattern

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.760 align:middle line:84%
that you can put
into the universe.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:13.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine sound
and not only as something

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.970 align:middle line:84%
you can perceive
but also something

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:20.090 align:middle line:84%
that is a wave
pattern, then that

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:24.960 align:middle line:84%
is something that passed
the way, so to speak,

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.730 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring
information from me to you.

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:34.070 align:middle line:84%
But psyonics, those
are also wave patterns.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:38.990 align:middle line:84%
That is why technology can
utilize that mechanism,

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:43.340 align:middle line:84%
imitate those wave
patterns and bring psyonics

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.910 align:middle line:90%
through technology.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:50.420 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of species have
understood those mechanisms.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:54.500 align:middle line:84%
They are more trained and
more used to use those wave

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:55.880 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.500 align:middle line:90%
Some species are not.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:05.930 align:middle line:84%
But in those species that you
mentioned, they use telepathy.

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And they mostly do
it, because it's

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:14.040 align:middle line:84%
a way for them to overcome
the barriers of sound,

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.660 align:middle line:84%
which means it's
easier for them to put

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.910 align:middle line:90%
a thought into your head.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:24.470 align:middle line:90%
Because then information is--

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:29.060 align:middle line:84%
it's interpreted by
your own perception

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:34.220 align:middle line:84%
instead of listening
to acoustic signals

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and putting them into
some kind of understanding

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:43.280 align:middle line:90%
system or something like that.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It's very
specific, telepathy,

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.100 align:middle line:90%
through my experience.

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Because if I said, Tim,
let's go to the park,

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:56.390 align:middle line:84%
that message that you
see is already the time.

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:58.160 align:middle line:90%
You see the park.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.320 align:middle line:90%
You know where it's at.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:04.250 align:middle line:84%
There's so much more covered
in that one patch of energy

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:90%
that comes at you.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen this with
extraterrestrials too.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a universal language.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the way a
mental-based universe

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.260 align:middle line:90%
communicates with itself.

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.510 align:middle line:90%
That overcomes some struggle.

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So mostly, for example, if
we are talking about those

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:28.760 align:middle line:84%
humanoid races, those other
humans that are existing

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.290 align:middle line:84%
in the universe-- and I'm at
least aware of three types that

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:34.220 align:middle line:90%
do that--

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:37.970 align:middle line:84%
they not only have a very
sophisticated language system,

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:44.180 align:middle line:84%
but they also are very
advanced and very concentrated

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:48.140 align:middle line:84%
in the way they put
their cohesive thought

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.540 align:middle line:90%
into the language.

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:55.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's not only speaking
and bringing out sounds.

00:24:55.910 --> 00:25:02.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a very sophisticated
and concentrated transfer

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:06.230 align:middle line:90%
of different data sets.

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And emotion.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: And emotion, yes.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Emotions are hugely
important to the universe.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:18.050 align:middle line:84%
That is also something that
has been modified and altered

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:19.280 align:middle line:90%
by that installation.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Because if we look at it,
lots and lots of things

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:27.320 align:middle line:84%
that you can perceive in
the media or something

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:32.000 align:middle line:84%
on this planet,
those things, they

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.130 align:middle line:84%
tend to modify the
emotions of people.

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:38.870 align:middle line:90%
They have fear.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:42.290 align:middle line:90%


00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Mostly every movie
that you can watch

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:48.680 align:middle line:90%
has some kind of death in it.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's always portrayed as
super traumatic and super,

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.750 align:middle line:90%
super intense and bad.

00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And that is also
something that got stuck.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's a
self-sustainable system.

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:08.870 align:middle line:84%
So once someone has put
that into an ape species,

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and that ape species
got habituated to that,

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:16.420 align:middle line:84%
it starts to recreate
this pattern.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's habitual.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Other species
do not do that.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Another species would
say like, why should I

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.345 align:middle line:84%
produce horror movies
which make people bad?

00:26:27.345 --> 00:26:28.220 align:middle line:90%
Why should I do that?

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.820 align:middle line:84%
They go back to the
decision, reflect upon it.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:33.500 align:middle line:90%
And then change their behavior.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:38.390 align:middle line:84%
But again, ape species
rely upon this pattern.

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:41.840 align:middle line:84%
They need that in a very
early stage of evolution

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.870 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring
stability to their system,

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:46.400 align:middle line:90%
to their genetics.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.220 align:middle line:90%
We've already overcome that.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:54.290 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason anymore
for all those behaviors, all

00:26:54.290 --> 00:27:00.957 align:middle line:84%
those ape-like, denaturalized,
systematic thinking.

00:27:00.957 --> 00:27:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, always a pleasure
to have you on the show.

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:04.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you, Emery.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.097 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:27:10.097 --> 00:27:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PRESENTER: Next, on
Cosmic Disclosure--

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: Jesus' extraordinary
birth involves

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.000 align:middle line:90%
UFO phenomenon of course.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.140 align:middle line:84%
According to religion Mary was
impregnated by the Holy Spirit

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.650 align:middle line:84%
or as the messages of
extraterrestrial beings assert,

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Mary was artificially
inseminated.

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:33.850 align:middle line:84%
This makes me wonder, if
Gabriel and other angels

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:38.200 align:middle line:84%
were really extraterrestrials,
these great masters of history

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:42.495 align:middle line:84%
were assisted by superior forces
and in my way of seeing things

00:27:42.495 --> 00:27:44.620 align:middle line:84%
with the active participation
of extraterrestrials.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:48.270 align:middle line:90%
