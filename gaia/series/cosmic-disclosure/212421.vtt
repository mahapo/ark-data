>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.050 align:middle line:10%
we're with former US
Marine, Mike Herrera.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.720 align:middle line:10%
Mike is a veteran with a
distinguished service record.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.450 align:middle line:10%
Today, we discuss crash
retrieval programs.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.548 align:middle line:90%
Mike, welcome to the show.

00:00:30.548 --> 00:00:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>> MIKE HERRERA: Thanks,
Emery, for having me on again.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well tell us about
these retrieval programs you

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.630 align:middle line:90%
were involved with.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: So as far as the
crash retrieval programs,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:84%
especially with these black
teams that are involved with,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.060 align:middle line:84%
you obviously have P3
assets, which is the psionic

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.060 align:middle line:84%
predisposition potential
screening for people that have

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.570 align:middle line:84%
these psionic abilities, which
allow them to be at a level

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.900 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that
can connect to ET craft.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Now everybody
understands in 1947

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that that was one
of the biggest crash

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.508 align:middle line:84%
retrievals that is known to
the public as far as Roswell.

00:01:01.508 --> 00:01:03.050 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
two more on that day

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.092 align:middle line:84%
that happened because
there was a total of three.

00:01:05.092 --> 00:01:06.890 align:middle line:84%
There was Tombstone
and there was Socorro.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.690 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.790 align:middle line:84%
The whole point was
509th bomber squadron

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.290 align:middle line:84%
was White Sands
Missile range, which

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.130 align:middle line:84%
was the only atomic weapon armed
bomber squadron in the world.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:84%
So of course, when they're
detonating weapons out

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.960 align:middle line:84%
in that area, it
got their attention.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So because they had this
technology even since the 1930s

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.100 align:middle line:84%
and even the early '40s
for shooting down ET craft,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.950 align:middle line:84%
they put radar systems
integrated with the scalar

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.800 align:middle line:84%
technology, and that's why
they shot those craft down.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.990 align:middle line:84%
So there's been
speculation on where

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.370 align:middle line:90%
these craft have been taken to.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.510 align:middle line:84%
There's been people
who have talked

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:84%
about them going to
Wright-Patterson Air Force

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:90%
base.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
specifics of that.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that the
black team was also

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.385 align:middle line:84%
involved with stuff like
that back in the '40s.

00:01:47.385 --> 00:01:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What was their
job, the black team,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.517 align:middle line:84%
out there with these three
crash retrieval sites?

00:01:51.517 --> 00:01:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I don't know
specifically during those days.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.900 align:middle line:84%
I know present day, it's more
isolated to whatever areas

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.400 align:middle line:84%
they're in or
whatever installations

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.510 align:middle line:90%
that they're currently at.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: What shot them down?

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.540 align:middle line:84%
What kind of technology
were they using?

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Well, it's a
scalar weapon systems or scalar

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.140 align:middle line:90%
longitudinal weapons.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.850 align:middle line:90%
So it's like an EMP.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.360 align:middle line:84%
It obviously has a wide
band of what they're

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.740 align:middle line:90%
projecting onto these craft.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.945 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, if
you're stunning craft

00:02:15.945 --> 00:02:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and then get them to fall out of
the sky and impact the ground,

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:84%
obviously, that's going to be a
force that they can deal with.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like getting in a
car accident but multiples

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:84%
because of how fast they're
falling out of the sky.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.835 align:middle line:84%
So if you do that times
3, obviously, they're

00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:29.710 align:middle line:84%
not going to go in a
perfect trajectory down.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.127 align:middle line:84%
They just immobilize
them and then

00:02:31.127 --> 00:02:33.547 align:middle line:84%
they succumb to the
forces of gravity.

00:02:33.547 --> 00:02:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So we've been using
the same technology for 40

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.750 align:middle line:90%
years is what you're saying?

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.583 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:39.565 align:middle line:84%
Even probably longer
than that, but for a fact

00:02:39.565 --> 00:02:41.190 align:middle line:84%
I know that when
we've been using that.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.773 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't say we,
but I know they've

00:02:42.773 --> 00:02:44.340 align:middle line:90%
been using it for that long.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.792 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: We, meaning, the?

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Human race.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: The human race?

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are these scalar
weapons located all around

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.590 align:middle line:90%
the planet or in space?

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Both.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.640 align:middle line:84%
They have neutrino detectors on
satellites with weapon systems

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:90%
that are integrated into such.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And then they have
ground-based systems

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.520 align:middle line:90%
that also do the same thing.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.495 align:middle line:84%
more advanced, I
would say, compared

00:03:04.495 --> 00:03:06.120 align:middle line:84%
to what they have in
space because they

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.413 align:middle line:90%
can refine that over time.

00:03:07.413 --> 00:03:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Out in space, they're
going to have to fly out

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.460 align:middle line:90%
there, man those operations.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what's
going on out there?

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.175 align:middle line:84%
But ground-based systems,
I know they're constantly

00:03:15.175 --> 00:03:17.172 align:middle line:90%
revising and perfecting them.

00:03:17.172 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What's the difference
between a covert team

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.490 align:middle line:90%
and a government team?

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:90%
Who performs the retrieval?

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Essentially, both.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.590 align:middle line:84%
So what David
Grusch just came out

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:84%
to the public was the existence
of the government's crash

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.570 align:middle line:84%
retrieval programs that
they have, which is it's

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.140 align:middle line:84%
still a Special Access
Project, an SAP.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Covert teams more operate on an
unacknowledged special access

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.940 align:middle line:84%
programs where nobody
realistically knows about it.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.257 align:middle line:84%
So government teams have
their own standard operating

00:03:42.257 --> 00:03:44.340 align:middle line:84%
procedures with dealing
with crash retrievals that

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.190 align:middle line:84%
may be used for their
understanding, their--

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.812 align:middle line:84%
whatever agendas
that they've got.

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:50.520 align:middle line:84%
But then you have this
black organization

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.310 align:middle line:84%
which has a more refined
system, that's more advanced,

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.030 align:middle line:90%
they know what they're doing.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And they can do stuff
under a guise that's

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.375 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily well-known
compared to other people who're

00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:00.870 align:middle line:90%
already in the government.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You spoke about the
two different facets that are

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.830 align:middle line:84%
coming in the government
and then the black team.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Who gets there first?

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Is there some sort
of protocol in place?

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.510 align:middle line:84%
When this all happens,
who gets the first call?

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: So I don't know the
specifics of that but what I

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.680 align:middle line:84%
will tell you is that in
these areas that are operated

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.830 align:middle line:84%
by these black teams, they
have, essentially, first dibs.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.860 align:middle line:84%
They're going to move in,
execute their SOPs, if you

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.930 align:middle line:90%
will, snag the--

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and do the retrieval, snag
the craft up and take it

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.650 align:middle line:90%
wherever they need to.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.940 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to government,
I have no idea.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.900 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that when the
black teams have oversight

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.410 align:middle line:84%
on the areas that they do,
it's like a testing ground,

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.210 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:84%
So everything is secured
by their own assets.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:84%
So if government
assets try to come in,

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.098 align:middle line:84%
they can subvert
those very easily.

00:04:46.098 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So they're very
well aware of each other now,

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.320 align:middle line:84%
not what your situation when you
walked up on a situation where

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.315 align:middle line:90%
they were--

00:04:53.315 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I think it's
actually a mixture of that

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.562 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of the-- a
lot of the government assets

00:04:58.562 --> 00:05:00.270 align:middle line:84%
don't know of the
black team's existence.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.850 align:middle line:84%
The only ones that do
are either people like me

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.180 align:middle line:84%
who actually know people face
to face or it's even the fact

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.320 align:middle line:84%
that it may be
incidental to a degree,

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.260 align:middle line:84%
but it's also the fact
that in the government,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:84%
there's people who know about
the black teams exist and are

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.550 align:middle line:84%
either on par with them
or being paid or used

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:90%
as a tool on their end.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So how are
these craft recovered?

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.620 align:middle line:90%
And what have they found?

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.693 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Well, as far as
craft goes, they obviously--

00:05:22.693 --> 00:05:24.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so
many different races,

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.800 align:middle line:84%
there's so many
different types of craft.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it could be from
different star systems.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.998 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
specifics of that.

00:05:28.998 --> 00:05:32.400 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that they
have a very vast variation

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.000 align:middle line:84%
of different types of craft,
ranging from triangular shaped,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.450 align:middle line:84%
even to circular
Crescent shaped, even,

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:90%
just speculation on that.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.240 align:middle line:84%
But it would make sense if
you've been shooting down craft

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.212 align:middle line:84%
and for the past 60, 70, 80
years at these installations

00:05:49.212 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:84%
that they have
control over, you're

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.670 align:middle line:84%
going to run into some
different types of vehicles.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Let's talk
about civilians on site.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.770 align:middle line:84%
What's the protocol for
when civilians are there?

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:00.630 align:middle line:90%
What do you guys do?

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I mean, let's look
at what happened in Las Vegas

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.257 align:middle line:90%
not too long ago.

00:06:04.257 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:10%
That's a little interesting
because people started

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.648 align:middle line:10%
seeing this stuff happen.

00:06:07.648 --> 00:06:09.190 align:middle line:10%
They obviously have
a law enforcement

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.990 align:middle line:10%
that go into basically
cordon the area off.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.950 align:middle line:90%
You may have military.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.410 align:middle line:84%
You may have agents from
different other agencies that

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:90%
go out and do that.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.998 align:middle line:84%
In some way, somebody
knows what happened.

00:06:17.998 --> 00:06:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And somebody's got
the Intel for that

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.707 align:middle line:84%
to happen so they're going
to send a response force.

00:06:21.707 --> 00:06:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, if you're a
civilian like us being Marines,

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.247 align:middle line:84%
stumbling onto an
operation like this,

00:06:27.247 --> 00:06:29.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they're going to
be greeted too nicely, needless

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.617 align:middle line:84%
to say, but it also depends on
who's managing that operation.

00:06:32.617 --> 00:06:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What can you tell us
about the origins of the craft,

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:90%
if anything?

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I just know that
they're extraterrestrial.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.280 align:middle line:84%
I do know that sometimes,
they do target other agency's

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.750 align:middle line:90%
reverse engineered craft.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.020 align:middle line:84%
But those are usually completely
destroyed and incinerated.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.720 align:middle line:84%
As far as the actual
ET craft, I just

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.050 align:middle line:84%
know that they come from
other planets than here

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.840 align:middle line:84%
or other star systems,
things like that.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.552 align:middle line:84%
So-- and that's what they're
read up on to take out.

00:06:57.552 --> 00:06:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What can you
tell us about the Greys?

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.093 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I don't know a whole
lot but I do know some people

00:07:02.093 --> 00:07:05.750 align:middle line:84%
in this organization that have
ran into them with these crash

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.020 align:middle line:84%
retrievals, targeting their
ships, and bringing them down.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was any of
the Greys ever taken in?

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Actually, I do
know that they have taken live

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.840 align:middle line:90%
specimens, if you will.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
the purpose of that was

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.550 align:middle line:84%
or if it was something that
was related to understanding

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.030 align:middle line:84%
their genetic codes or anything
that benefit any of them

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.270 align:middle line:90%
to understand that.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So I do know that they've
had live occupants that they

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.010 align:middle line:90%
have retrieved.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.662 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And where
do they take them?

00:07:32.662 --> 00:07:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: To any of these
facilities that they have close

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.210 align:middle line:84%
by, where they're using these
P3 to basically call them these

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.410 align:middle line:90%
craft and then they target them.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are any of these
facilities located near

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.590 align:middle line:90%
or under military installations?

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:48.930 align:middle line:90%
A lot of them are close by.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.555 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
underneath the ground.

00:07:50.555 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Some of them actually are
at military installations

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:84%
but at parts that nobody
knows about, unless you've

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.400 align:middle line:90%
been read into that program.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And for the most part,
it's all underground.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You mentioned these
facilities are on military

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.480 align:middle line:90%
installations or below them.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.700 align:middle line:84%
How can the military
installation not really know

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.510 align:middle line:90%
what's going on?

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Well, it's
all compartmentalized.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.990 align:middle line:84%
The only people that are
read into those programs

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.670 align:middle line:84%
have been briefed
or are participating

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.050 align:middle line:84%
in it are the only ones
that are going to know.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.845 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: And if you're
under an NDA, for example,

00:08:16.845 --> 00:08:19.470 align:middle line:84%
and your career is in jeopardy,
you're not going to really talk

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:19.990 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.500 align:middle line:84%
So they're very good at
basically keeping these things

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.590 align:middle line:84%
under tight lip, enforcing
UCMJ at certain points,

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.437 align:middle line:84%
especially with these higher ups
to not say anything to anybody.

00:08:29.437 --> 00:08:31.020 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
if it's underground,

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.909 align:middle line:84%
you don't ever see
anything topside.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:35.520 align:middle line:84%
But as it's been
known, these facilities

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.240 align:middle line:84%
also link together underground
with maglev trains, at least,

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:84%
that are close to other
installations that

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:42.520 align:middle line:90%
are underground.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Correct.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, UCMJ is the Uniform
Code of Military Justice,

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.420 align:middle line:84%
for our audience, since you
just mentioned that, which

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.600 align:middle line:84%
is a good threat to
any person working

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.347 align:middle line:90%
as a contractor or active duty.

00:08:54.347 --> 00:08:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So you're saying these
maglev trains are connected

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.648 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of these
underground facilities.

00:08:59.648 --> 00:09:00.482 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:09:00.482 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what
are they doing?

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Are they transferring bodies
or do they transfer craft?

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.892 align:middle line:84%
What's-- what can
they do with these?

00:09:08.892 --> 00:09:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: My assumption is
that they would because if you

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.820 align:middle line:90%
have something like--

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.370 align:middle line:84%
let's say, you did a
crash retrieval operation.

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.863 align:middle line:90%
You took it to an installation.

00:09:16.863 --> 00:09:18.280 align:middle line:84%
But let's say, you
made some noise

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.072 align:middle line:84%
and got some people's
attention because I'm

00:09:20.072 --> 00:09:21.790 align:middle line:90%
sure that none of this is quiet.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:25.660 align:middle line:84%
So it would be smart, especially
with these covert operations

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.330 align:middle line:84%
that they do, that you'd want to
transfer the stuff underground.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'm assuming they've
got systems to do that.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Now as far as the craft that I
know that are pretty massive,

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.190 align:middle line:84%
there's been speculations
of some craft

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.648 align:middle line:84%
that they brought
down that they've

00:09:37.648 --> 00:09:40.390 align:middle line:84%
had to build entire buildings
on top of to mask them

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:41.830 align:middle line:84%
because they're
too heavy to move.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:45.097 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have anything
to realistically move them.

00:09:45.097 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: What about the bodies?

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:50.240 align:middle line:84%
You said they did have
some live captured species.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.120 align:middle line:84%
What about the bodies that
may have not survived?

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.483 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard about them?

00:09:54.483 --> 00:09:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I know
they incinerate them.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.862 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why do you
think they do that?

00:09:57.862 --> 00:10:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Evidence purposes,
but they don't have anything

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.210 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.990 align:middle line:84%
if you have a
cadaver of ET origin,

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how you'd
necessarily preserve that

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.565 align:middle line:84%
or why you would,
unless you're harvesting

00:10:08.565 --> 00:10:10.940 align:middle line:84%
some sort of genetic material
from them for understanding

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.637 align:middle line:90%
or for research purposes.

00:10:12.637 --> 00:10:14.720 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost the same
thing like a human being,

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.932 align:middle line:84%
you're typically not able
to keep stuff that fresh.

00:10:16.932 --> 00:10:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It's like evidence.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yeah.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And they're hiding
it from within each other?

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: I would assume so.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's--
again, the black teams,

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.240 align:middle line:84%
everything is also
compartmentalized with that.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like
everybody knows what

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.290 align:middle line:90%
certain operators are doing.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.137 align:middle line:84%
One can be a crash
retrieval asset.

00:10:32.137 --> 00:10:34.220 align:middle line:84%
The other one can be weapons
development, research

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.803 align:middle line:84%
and development, and never know
that there's a crash retrieval

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:39.620 align:middle line:84%
program, except if they see
something sitting there,

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.080 align:middle line:84%
like a craft, and
they probably have

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.560 align:middle line:90%
a couple questions about that.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.227 align:middle line:84%
But then again, you're
in an environment

00:10:45.227 --> 00:10:47.340 align:middle line:84%
where you can't necessarily
ask those questions.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are you aware of
any crash retrieval program

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.940 align:middle line:84%
or incident that it went
bad and people were injured

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.660 align:middle line:84%
or the craft may be fought
back or there was an explosion?

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I've heard of an
instance in somewhere close

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.730 align:middle line:84%
to Vietnam where something
like that happened,

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.360 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't ET, It
was a man-made craft.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And they fired on
people, troops.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Intentionally
or accidentally?

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Intentionally.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:16.960 align:middle line:84%
It's like an
incidental witness--

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.835 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was it our
troops, American troops?

00:11:18.835 --> 00:11:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yeah.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.430 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.960 align:middle line:84%
That's, at least,
what I was told.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.610 align:middle line:84%
So I can't really
completely verify.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:90%
It's just--

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was this during
the Vietnam War, you mean?

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yes.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yeah.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now are they drones or
are they occupied by biological

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.015 align:middle line:90%
intelligence?

00:11:34.015 --> 00:11:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: So
for the most part,

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.820 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be
biological intelligence.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Especially the way
that they work in conjunction

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.090 align:middle line:90%
with these P3 assets.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:45.250 align:middle line:84%
So when-- them talking
about even taking down

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.430 align:middle line:84%
other reverse engineer craft
from different agencies,

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:50.828 align:middle line:84%
so you're going to have some
speculation where they have

00:11:50.828 --> 00:11:52.870 align:middle line:84%
operations where they're
using these program life

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:54.760 align:middle line:84%
forms to pilot
these craft to make

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.050 align:middle line:90%
them look like they're ETs.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:84%
My suspicion would
be like the Kumburgaz

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:90%
craft that was off Turkey.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.162 align:middle line:84%
And they got clear
footage of that.

00:12:04.162 --> 00:12:05.620 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
that craft, it's

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.060 align:middle line:84%
not like a solid,
seamless piece.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:08.860 align:middle line:90%
It has ridges.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.540 align:middle line:90%
It has panels.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And you can see some occupants
standing right there.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.990 align:middle line:84%
But those look exactly what
PLFs are going to look like.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Now those are ours?

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.082 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Those are man-made.

00:12:20.082 --> 00:12:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Man-made
program life forms.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.243 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: And
everybody mistake them

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:25.960 align:middle line:84%
for extraterrestrial
intelligence.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.510 align:middle line:84%
To somebody who's not
understanding or is

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.570 align:middle line:84%
even aware of what
we're revealing today,

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.160 align:middle line:90%
they're going to think it's ET.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.990 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
think the craft is ET.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:35.920 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Sure.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.455 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: --truth is
stranger than fiction,

00:12:38.455 --> 00:12:39.798 align:middle line:90%
especially this day and age.

00:12:39.798 --> 00:12:41.590 align:middle line:84%
So if they think they
see that then they're

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.840 align:middle line:84%
going to tell everybody, oh,
it's an ET craft with ETs

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.520 align:middle line:84%
that I saw, but
it's, in fact, ours.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now do they do that
every now and then just to help

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.540 align:middle line:90%
with disinformation?

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: 100%.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- even if you
saw something in the sky.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:84%
You're going to assume it's
ET because some-- most people

00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.017 align:middle line:90%
don't know what to look for.

00:12:59.017 --> 00:12:59.817 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Sure.

00:12:59.817 --> 00:13:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: They don't
know how to actually spot

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.747 align:middle line:84%
the differences
between real ET craft,

00:13:03.747 --> 00:13:05.830 align:middle line:84%
something that looks organic
compared to something

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.110 align:middle line:84%
that's man-made and
looks manufactured.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: On any of these
retrieval expeditions,

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.470 align:middle line:84%
have you ever seen
a craft come down,

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and then the teams called in,
and then another craft shows up

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.400 align:middle line:90%
to rescue them?

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I've heard of an
instance of that happening,

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.330 align:middle line:90%
where they had--

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and this, I believe,
was from a contact

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:33.780 align:middle line:84%
within the Disclosure Project
who was actually working

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:90%
as a crash retrieval operative.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And they had an ET craft
that they brought down.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And then there was another
one that was flying close by.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.020 align:middle line:84%
But then they also had
a reverse engineer craft

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.030 align:middle line:90%
that was flying close by too.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And when they brought
that craft down,

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:84%
they had the actual ETs that
were still alive actually

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.140 align:middle line:90%
come out of the craft.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:57.128 align:middle line:84%
And they actually made everybody
teleport back to the LZ

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:59.670 align:middle line:84%
where they were staging their
gear and getting onto the birds

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.920 align:middle line:84%
to go do that operation
instantaneously.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.117 align:middle line:84%
Nobody was hurt, injured,
killed, or nothing.

00:14:04.117 --> 00:14:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now you're talking
about the extraterrestrials

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:90%
or the unit--

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:08.220 align:middle line:90%
the black--

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: The whole unit.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: The whole unit--

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: The whole unit
was transferred back to--

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: --went through
a type of transporter

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.190 align:middle line:90%
or teletransporter--

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Something the ETs--

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:15.450 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: --like portal?

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Something that the ETs were
able to do to these people

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.890 align:middle line:90%
just instantaneously.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
people that was there

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:26.400 align:middle line:84%
was basically talking
about how the ETs basically

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.680 align:middle line:84%
put through their head that
what you guys are doing

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.950 align:middle line:84%
is not good, basically,
showing their disapproval

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:32.850 align:middle line:90%
of that operation.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they
teleported them back to the LZ.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: And where was that at?

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Nevada Testing
Range, somewhere out there.

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Somewhere out there?

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Mm-hmm.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And how often
have you heard this happen?

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I've heard this same
story from at least, from Dr.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Greer's group because
he's got the guy,

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.740 align:middle line:90%
the whistleblower part of that.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.032 align:middle line:84%
And then there's been instances
where this guy has also

00:14:54.032 --> 00:14:57.050 align:middle line:84%
said the same information
amongst multiple different

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.850 align:middle line:90%
outlets.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.308 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Have you heard of
this teletransporter being used

00:15:00.308 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:90%
on other missions?

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.242 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: No, I have
not ever heard that.

00:15:03.242 --> 00:15:05.170 align:middle line:90%
This is the first time.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And could we speculate to say
that it does happen regularly?

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's the easiest
way to avoid conflict.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a high
intelligent being,

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:84%
you don't want shots fired
and you have the ability

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.993 align:middle line:84%
to do that, I mean, I would
easily do that if I was them.

00:15:18.993 --> 00:15:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What happened to
the craft that was there,

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.850 align:middle line:84%
trying to rescue them after
they see their friends being

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.020 align:middle line:90%
transported somewhere?

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: I have no idea.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.550 align:middle line:84%
That-- I mean, you can
say speculation too

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.620 align:middle line:84%
that maybe there were
part of that as well.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I mean, why didn't
we shoot that craft down right

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.558 align:middle line:90%
away immediately?

00:15:34.558 --> 00:15:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: It may have
come in focus or at least

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.650 align:middle line:84%
in materialized as
that was going down.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.233 align:middle line:84%
So they probably
didn't have knowledge

00:15:40.233 --> 00:15:43.560 align:middle line:84%
of it being right there until
this event was going on.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Maybe it was cloaked
or fluxing in and out of this--

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Something like
that, since they can travel

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.880 align:middle line:84%
interdimensionally to get from
point A to point B in the star

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.740 align:middle line:90%
systems, as well as the--

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.040 align:middle line:90%
or at least the whole universe.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're talking about
light years being way too slow,

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.990 align:middle line:90%
traveling at the speed of light.

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.380 align:middle line:84%
So traveling
interdimensional is going

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.690 align:middle line:84%
to be the fastest way to
do it, bending spacetime.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now Sciencix are
involved with the pilot

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and the craft because the
pilots are part of the craft,

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.380 align:middle line:84%
and something
happens to the pilot.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.910 align:middle line:90%
What happens to the craft then?

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.720 align:middle line:90%
How is that moved around?

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: So the P3 is going
to obviously connect to both.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And from what I
understand, the P3 asset

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.150 align:middle line:84%
actually connects to
the craft as a whole.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like they disrupt
the communication

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.230 align:middle line:90%
between the ET and the craft.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.950 align:middle line:84%
So they hold it
stationary in order to--

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They
block that signal.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:34.243 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: P3 takes over.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yup.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And then the
handler tells them what to do?

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Which most of the time,
I mean, if they're--

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.760 align:middle line:84%
at least this one
installation, if they're

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.520 align:middle line:84%
able to take down two or
three ET craft a year,

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.950 align:middle line:84%
that's really not a
whole lot in comparison,

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.140 align:middle line:84%
depending on how many
times a year they're

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.910 align:middle line:90%
doing operations like this.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if it's a weekly
thing where they're

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
going out and doing s--
having a P3, summoned a craft,

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.640 align:middle line:84%
and then them targeting
it, it shows that they

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.260 align:middle line:90%
have a very low success rate.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.099 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Now working on
projects myself, there

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.740 align:middle line:84%
was a high number of craft
that were acquired every year.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.060 align:middle line:84%
What do you think the numbers
are with what you've known

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.010 align:middle line:84%
and what you've been
exposed to yearly about

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.210 align:middle line:90%
craft they're acquiring?

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.772 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: So as
a global concept,

00:17:20.772 --> 00:17:23.189 align:middle line:84%
because it's not just this
installation that I know about.

00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.369 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Sure.

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I mean, it spans
the whole entire world.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.109 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking at
one installation taken

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:30.390 align:middle line:90%
down 80 craft a year if that--

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.640 align:middle line:90%
times that 100.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.937 align:middle line:84%
You have 800 to 1,000 craft
being taken down a year.

00:17:34.937 --> 00:17:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: That's a lot of craft.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: It's a lot.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.972 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, what
are they doing with it?

00:17:38.972 --> 00:17:39.930 align:middle line:90%
Are they destroying it?

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Are they-- what are they
doing with the materials?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So the other question
too is, is there

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.883 align:middle line:84%
duplicates of the
same type of craft

00:17:47.883 --> 00:17:49.800 align:middle line:84%
that they're coming in
contact with from maybe

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.720 align:middle line:90%
the specific same race?

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And they already
have that perfected

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.133 align:middle line:90%
so they no longer need it.

00:17:55.133 --> 00:17:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if they're
trying to pick and choose

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:84%
what they're doing and
what type of craft, or hey,

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.650 align:middle line:84%
there's a new one that we
just-- that just popped up here.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to
take this one out?

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how they
do that, but it's all up

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:84%
to speculation and very
interesting points.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Mike, if you
were on a retrieval team,

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.750 align:middle line:90%
how would that trigger you?

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: That
would be emotional,

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.180 align:middle line:90%
especially if it's for--

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Very much so.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: --especially
if it's from our own doing

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.030 align:middle line:84%
because it's no different than
having somebody with an exotic

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.830 align:middle line:84%
car coming up to you,
and all of a sudden,

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.380 align:middle line:84%
you're having to take their
life because you want to drive

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.857 align:middle line:84%
their car or maybe duplicate the
engine or the modules in that

00:18:28.857 --> 00:18:31.440 align:middle line:84%
vehicle and integrate them into
another car that you're trying

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.160 align:middle line:90%
to make.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.310 align:middle line:90%
That's how I would see it.

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.560 align:middle line:84%
So that aspect, I
think, would be--

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.220 align:middle line:90%
it'd be horrible to a degree.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.122 align:middle line:84%
Now somebody who is fascinated
with this kind of technology,

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:44.580 align:middle line:84%
especially after my experience
and seeing these things move

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:84%
personally, it would
answer a lot of questions

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.250 align:middle line:84%
as far as the unknown of how
this process actually happens

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.427 align:middle line:90%
and what the SOPs are.

00:18:53.427 --> 00:18:55.510 align:middle line:84%
The bigger grand scheme
of things of how they even

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.030 align:middle line:84%
keep a secret would be
something that I'd actually

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:00.770 align:middle line:84%
be more interested in because
then you understand how

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.240 align:middle line:90%
to-- how everything works.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.705 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's hope it doesn't
have to come to that, of course.

00:19:05.705 --> 00:19:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Likewise.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why is the black
program so adversarial?

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Because wouldn't it
be easier for them

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.160 align:middle line:84%
just to all just join together
and we can help each other out?

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: That'd be
the ideal circumstances.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:18.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that would be
how I would approach it,

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:21.100 align:middle line:84%
more of a diplomatic approach,
because we're not trying

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.392 align:middle line:90%
to make enemies with everybody.

00:19:22.392 --> 00:19:24.490 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is
you have people who

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.380 align:middle line:90%
get into a position of power.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And you have this
kind of technology.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Then you understand how to
monetize it and make money.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: There's the greed.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:32.272 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: So
there's greed is 100%.

00:19:32.272 --> 00:19:33.320 align:middle line:90%
That plus the power.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you have people
in these positions that

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.080 align:middle line:84%
have that lifestyle,
if you will,

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.580 align:middle line:84%
that they are very
powerful people--

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Secret power.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Exactly.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And you're able to
guarantee in a country

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.600 align:middle line:84%
that, hey, they don't have
anything close to what

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.933 align:middle line:90%
the black teams have.

00:19:48.933 --> 00:19:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, they're not
going to want to give that up.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.642 align:middle line:84%
They want to be the top of
the food chain, so to speak.

00:19:53.642 --> 00:19:56.210 align:middle line:84%
They want to be the
predator of the world.

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:84%
So with that being said,
greed is the number one reason

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:90%
for that plus the power.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Tragic.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Mm-hmm.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They talk about
the Secret Space Program.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Now is this part of
the black projects

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.882 align:middle line:84%
or is it part of
just our military?

00:20:11.882 --> 00:20:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I believe, it's
part of just our military

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.520 align:middle line:84%
because the black teams,
I'm not aware of them.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.825 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They have their
own thing, don't they?

00:20:17.825 --> 00:20:18.800 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: They should
have their own thing.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if they have the assets
to do it, the technologies,

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.540 align:middle line:84%
then it'd probably be safe
to assume that they've

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.190 align:middle line:90%
got their own means to do this.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So they have
their own military,

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.910 align:middle line:84%
their own space force,
their own Air Force,

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:30.720 align:middle line:84%
their own ground
teams, and everything.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yup.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.670 align:middle line:90%
Own funding mechanisms.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.920 align:middle line:84%
They got people bought and
paid for in the government.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.140 align:middle line:90%
They've got their own--

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.140 align:middle line:84%
they're embedded in the
legal system to a degree

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.800 align:middle line:84%
too that they can ride the
flying waves of these laws

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.882 align:middle line:90%
and regulations.

00:20:41.882 --> 00:20:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now there's a lot of
civilians out there claiming

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.130 align:middle line:84%
to be part of a
Secret Space Program,

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:50.250 align:middle line:84%
also claiming that their minds
have been swiped and they start

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.990 align:middle line:90%
to have recall.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.520 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about this?

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.603 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: I mean,
anything's possible with that.

00:20:55.603 --> 00:20:57.898 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know
anybody personally

00:20:57.898 --> 00:20:59.440 align:middle line:84%
who may have been
involved with that,

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.773 align:middle line:84%
but then again, I know it's
something that they probably

00:21:01.773 --> 00:21:06.450 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't ever share just because
of how fascinating it sounds.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.670 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't rule it
out because there's always

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle line:84%
people looking for
probably neutral people

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.580 align:middle line:84%
to see what the
effect is on subject A

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.770 align:middle line:84%
compared to somebody who's
like military-trained

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.360 align:middle line:90%
or somebody who's a scientist.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.850 align:middle line:84%
So somebody who is
in between that,

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.813 align:middle line:84%
they might want to see what
the effects of that is.

00:21:23.813 --> 00:21:25.230 align:middle line:84%
At least, that's
my interpretation

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:26.858 align:middle line:90%
of how that would work.

00:21:26.858 --> 00:21:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is it possible that
some of these people that claim

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:34.140 align:middle line:84%
to be in these programs are
some of these P3s you mentioned?

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: It
could be possible.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: It's possible.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Yeah.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:38.913 align:middle line:84%
But from my
understanding, P3 assets

00:21:38.913 --> 00:21:40.830 align:middle line:84%
are only going to belong
to these black teams.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.268 align:middle line:84%
And they may have
other programs, maybe

00:21:43.268 --> 00:21:45.060 align:middle line:84%
stuff that is more on
the conventional side

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.830 align:middle line:84%
of the government
that have people

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.872 align:middle line:84%
with these psionic
potentials or--

00:21:49.872 --> 00:21:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Plus
these are temporary.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:52.680 align:middle line:90%
P3s are very temporary.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right?

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.913 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: So they may have
a refined system where they

00:21:55.913 --> 00:22:00.120 align:middle line:84%
have-- they're not really going
to the same extreme like they

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.700 align:middle line:84%
do with the P3s, which then
they suffer the fate of having

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.700 align:middle line:90%
to pass away.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:07.170 align:middle line:84%
They may have something a little
bit more dumbed down or more

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:10.530 align:middle line:84%
watered down, if you will,
that keep these people safe

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and they can still
achieve something

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:13.878 align:middle line:90%
like a similar objective.

00:22:13.878 --> 00:22:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So in your experience,
could you mention some

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:19.470 align:middle line:84%
of the positive things that may
have come out of some of these

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:90%
retrieval programs?

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.775 align:middle line:84%
>> HERRERA: Well, for
peaceful purposes,

00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:26.707 align:middle line:84%
let's say if we were to
take P3 assets and put them

00:22:26.707 --> 00:22:29.040 align:middle line:84%
in a population, at least,
let's say, the United States,

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.880 align:middle line:84%
for example, or
even the government.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.050 align:middle line:90%
Let's say that, hey--

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:84%
let's just say, thinking
ahead, the acknowledgment

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and existence of
extraterrestrials more wide

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:37.270 align:middle line:90%
known.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows, OK, we've
been confirmed that it exists.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:42.070 align:middle line:84%
People have probably seen
them, things like that.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.250 align:middle line:84%
What that can do is definitely
teach us more about ourselves

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:47.500 align:middle line:84%
because you have races that
may have been observing us

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.120 align:middle line:84%
for hundreds or
thousands of years.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.260 align:middle line:90%
They know our true origins.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:54.130 align:middle line:84%
They know what happened to the
past ancient civilizations.

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they could teach us on
where we actually come from

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.900 align:middle line:84%
or what our history
with the planet is.

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.670 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is too
technologically speaking.

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:07.730 align:middle line:84%
As bad as it is, murdering
extraterrestrials, acquiring

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.640 align:middle line:84%
that technology and using
them for nefarious purposes,

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.040 align:middle line:84%
if this comes to a head,
and all of a sudden,

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.590 align:middle line:84%
we start using this for
free energy, technology,

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:18.530 align:middle line:84%
so people don't have to
be dependent on cars,

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.942 align:middle line:84%
they don't have to be dependent
on these energy companies--

00:23:21.942 --> 00:23:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Gas, coal, and oil.

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:23.360 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Correct.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.828 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because you're
giving these people that

00:23:25.828 --> 00:23:28.670 align:middle line:84%
own those industries, which is
worth $700 trillion, estimated,

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.740 align:middle line:84%
these days, probably
even more of that,

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.822 align:middle line:84%
you're giving them more money
compared to being self-reliant.

00:23:33.822 --> 00:23:35.780 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about the
pollution aspect of it

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.120 align:middle line:84%
too so Earth is going
to be a lot healthier.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Also, what a lot of people
neglect to understand is you

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:84%
come into contact with
medical technologies.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Who's to say that you
can't regrow limbs

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.520 align:middle line:90%
with this kind of stuff?

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Who's to say that
you can't actually

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.980 align:middle line:84%
do something to eradicate
cancer based off

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.510 align:middle line:90%
of that type of technology?

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are so
many things that they

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.210 align:middle line:84%
could refine that would
make people healthier,

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.150 align:middle line:84%
it could make people
smarter, and in turn,

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:00.860 align:middle line:84%
because people are
having those effects,

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.110 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be happier.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:06.197 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be mind-blowing
to see what this brings when

00:24:06.197 --> 00:24:07.780 align:middle line:84%
it comes out because
then you're going

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.570 align:middle line:84%
to have happier
people, which means

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:13.150 align:middle line:84%
elevated consciousness, which
means humanity gets to elevate.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:90%
And who knows?

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we may get invited
to actually join these star

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.685 align:middle line:90%
systems and actually explore.

00:24:18.685 --> 00:24:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And we can
stop killing each other.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Exactly.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Well,
that's limitless then.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.007 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Exactly.

00:24:25.007 --> 00:24:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Well, thank you, Mike.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.173 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate.

00:24:27.173 --> 00:24:28.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a fascinating story.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.670 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being on the show.

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:30.587 align:middle line:90%
>> HERRERA: Thank you.

00:24:30.587 --> 00:24:31.543 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:24:31.543 --> 00:24:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.430 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
