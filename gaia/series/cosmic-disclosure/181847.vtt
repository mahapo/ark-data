>>JAY WEIDNER: Hi, everybody.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.540 align:middle line:10%
I'm Jay Weidner.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.040 align:middle line:10%
You're watching
"Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.050 align:middle line:10%
and we are back with
our guest, Jason Rice.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.580 align:middle line:10%
Hey, Jason.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.497 align:middle line:10%
>>JASON RICE: Hi, Jay.

00:00:26.497 --> 00:00:27.760 align:middle line:10%
Thank you again for having me.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.385 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, it's
great having you.

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:31.200 align:middle line:84%
In a previous episode,
you talked at length

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.705 align:middle line:90%
about the 20 & Back procedure.

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering
if there's anything

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.010 align:middle line:84%
you want to add about
that so that people

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:90%
can understand it better.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Certainly.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:84%
The Career Return program,
which I was a part of,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:84%
is also known by a
great many others

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.490 align:middle line:90%
as the 20 & Back program.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Oh, so, wait.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.410 align:middle line:84%
You did not know it
as the 20 & Back?

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.760 align:middle line:84%
We did not refer to
it as the 20 & Back.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.530 align:middle line:84%
We referred to it
as a Career Return,

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.560 align:middle line:84%
which is indicative of having
a career and returning.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.470 align:middle line:90%
CR.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It sounds like
a military kind of term.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.010 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.990 align:middle line:84%
The whole process
of a Career Return

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.230 align:middle line:84%
was to give the
soldiers an opportunity

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.200 align:middle line:84%
to have and build on the
last experience and training

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:84%
so that they could develop
further training and skills

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and pass those on to other
soldiers that are also part

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.610 align:middle line:90%
of the Career Return program.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Before you
did your Career Return,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.590 align:middle line:84%
you did 20 years into
the Secret Space Program.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.530 align:middle line:84%
During your time, how
many different ET groups

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.490 align:middle line:90%
did you meet?

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And I guess we should also
include hybrids and things that

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.240 align:middle line:90%
were created.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.040 align:middle line:84%
How many did you
meet, do you think?

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: During the entire
Career Return program,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.720 align:middle line:84%
there were two different
ETs on Planet One.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:84%
There were two
more on Planet Two.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And there were three
more on Planet Three.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:84%
There were also
other ETs that we

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.540 align:middle line:84%
were working with
during the training

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.770 align:middle line:84%
period at the very beginning
of my Career Return

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.240 align:middle line:84%
and as well as at the very
end of my Career Return,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.505 align:middle line:84%
when I was on the other side
of the fence as a trainer.

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And you worked with
other ET groups as a trainer?

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:84%
The ET that we
refer to as Charlie

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:84%
during the initial
first day coming

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.440 align:middle line:84%
into the underground
cave facility.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.357 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: The first ET
you actually ever saw?

00:02:35.357 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The very first one
that I had at that point

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.110 align:middle line:84%
recalled, because I
had seen and worked

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.400 align:middle line:84%
with others during the
desensitization program

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:90%
training.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:84%
The first one that I'd seen
and recalled up to that point,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.090 align:middle line:90%
his name was Charlie.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the name that
we had given to him.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't have a problem
with being called Charlie.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.530 align:middle line:90%
He was an EBEN, a typical Grey.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And his presence and
work with us in the FIG,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.100 align:middle line:84%
the Fort Indiantown
Gap cave facility,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.440 align:middle line:84%
was one in which he
was a resource for us.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And which sometimes
we would ask, OK,

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.340 align:middle line:84%
what do you think about
using such and such a tactic?

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And he would help them provide
his opinion or thoughts

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.647 align:middle line:90%
on those tactics.

00:03:28.647 --> 00:03:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: How did you
communicate with him?

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Mentally.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: What's an EBEN?

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Extraterrestrial
Biological Entity.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So he was like
a consultant in a way.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.283 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: A 1099 consult.

00:03:40.283 --> 00:03:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Did you ever
ask him what planet he

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.310 align:middle line:90%
was from or anything like that?

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.863 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: When we asked
him, he would point.

00:03:47.863 --> 00:03:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: At the sky?

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, he just
wouldn't give us the name.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was part
of the compartmentalization.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Was he benevolent?

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: He certainly
behaved as if he was

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.270 align:middle line:90%
from his friendly interactions.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.370 align:middle line:84%
After working for several
years with Charlie,

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:84%
you can't help but like
the sense of humor.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:84%
It's got an alien
way of thinking

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.070 align:middle line:84%
about things, but still an
endearing aspect to him.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So tell us
about your first encounters

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.200 align:middle line:84%
when you first
got to Planet One.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.310 align:middle line:84%
You meet these people, these
ETs from another planet,

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and what was it like
when you first met them?

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Going to Planet
One in our first mission

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:84%
was one of intel, recon,
in which we were dispatched

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.610 align:middle line:84%
to go into this city,
in which we had named

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Area 26, as a delegation
from a faraway city,

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:84%
far enough away that they
couldn't ask the neighbor

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.370 align:middle line:84%
to run and ask questions
about who we were.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.120 align:middle line:84%
It was far enough away
that we caravanned

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.930 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of supplies and
goods that we had purported

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.590 align:middle line:84%
to be bringing from this
faraway city, in which we'd

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:84%
wanted to start
establishing a trade route.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And so the interactions
and the welcomings that

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.960 align:middle line:90%
we'd received--

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.390 align:middle line:84%
because it was me and my
entire platoon that were there.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Now we weren't all staying
in the same building,

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.220 align:middle line:84%
or even in the
same neighborhood.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.650 align:middle line:84%
We had spread ourselves
out strategically

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
across the city in
groups of three or four,

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
and we were all
within five minutes

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:90%
distance of another team.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Now the furthest
teams would have

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.730 align:middle line:84%
taken a lot longer than
that to get to us if we

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.190 align:middle line:90%
had a need for a backup.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't all arrive at the
same place at the same time,

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.900 align:middle line:84%
as we felt that that would
have been too coincidental

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and may have raised
some suspicions.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.670 align:middle line:84%
So we had people that
trickled in after,

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.920 align:middle line:84%
some people that
trickled in days after,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:84%
so it appeared
that it was random.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And the welcome that we
received was one that

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.710 align:middle line:90%
was very warm, real friendly.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:84%
The ETs, humanoids,
of Planet One

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.410 align:middle line:84%
had not known a
war in generations.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So their concepts of acceptance
and friendliness and what

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.170 align:middle line:84%
we would consider
being neighborly

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:39.070 align:middle line:84%
was something that was
profoundly different

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.050 align:middle line:90%
for a number of my soldiers.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Because growing
up in a large city

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.850 align:middle line:84%
or a large metropolitan
area, you just

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.330 align:middle line:84%
don't have that kind
of open welcome.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle line:84%
How are they different from
Earth humans in the way

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.410 align:middle line:84%
they carried out
their activities?

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.800 align:middle line:84%
They were genuinely
interested in the community

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.930 align:middle line:90%
and pushing forth that.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think you'd
have to go back

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:13.190 align:middle line:84%
into Earth history's
past, where you have

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:21.650 align:middle line:84%
small colony-sized elements
of people that are living far

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.440 align:middle line:84%
away from other
civilizations, where

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.320 align:middle line:84%
it is of enormous benefit
for them to work together.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Planet Two, their
social structure

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.840 align:middle line:84%
and how the family
unit was set up

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.580 align:middle line:84%
was different than what
we were accustomed to,

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:47.140 align:middle line:84%
in that between three and
four different couples were

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.110 align:middle line:90%
considered a family.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And they considered
each other their husbands

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.760 align:middle line:90%
or their wives.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:58.990 align:middle line:84%
So that was also a vastly
different characteristic

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.230 align:middle line:84%
between the humanoids
on Planet Two

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
humans from Earth.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And then on Planet Three,
the prior existence

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.080 align:middle line:84%
of organized crime
on that planet

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.740 align:middle line:84%
meant that there
were already existing

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.820 align:middle line:84%
some of the seedier and darker
sides of what we would consider

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.270 align:middle line:90%
darker side of humanity.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, they had the
same thing there.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And Planet Three,
incidentally, was

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.250 align:middle line:84%
the only one in
my experience that

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.340 align:middle line:90%
had a type of fiat currency.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Was there ever a time
that you or any of your buddies

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.040 align:middle line:84%
where you wanted to
abandon IDARF and go live--

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Go native?

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: --Like "Avatar"?

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: No?

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Nope.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.978 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, we
could be tracked,

00:08:45.978 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:90%
and there was no escaping that.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.228 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's true.

00:08:48.228 --> 00:08:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And the
consequences of doing such--

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.740 align:middle line:90%
Time is an illusion.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to reconfigure
some of the entertainment

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:11.050 align:middle line:84%
value of the holographic systems
that we used to a punishment

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.570 align:middle line:90%
was a very real possibility.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And so you could end up
spending five years in your mind

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:84%
in a prison isolated or any
number of other punishments,

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.670 align:middle line:84%
where in the reality of it, it
lasts five minutes, 10 minutes,

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.470 align:middle line:90%
an hour.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So one of
those would be enough to--

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Enough to make you
not ever want to do it again.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And so to go native
and to go off the farm

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:84%
and join the
indigenous population,

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I'd say out of any
of the places that

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.380 align:middle line:84%
would have been attractive
to me personally,

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:55.930 align:middle line:84%
it would have been
Planet One and maybe even

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:59.140 align:middle line:84%
some parts of Calidus
Three, before the wars

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.058 align:middle line:90%
on both planets.

00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Is there
anything that you

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:09.820 align:middle line:84%
saw that showed their own
personal genius, things

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:15.640 align:middle line:84%
that they made or created that
wasn't the same as on Earth?

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.148 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, could
you describe that?

00:10:18.148 --> 00:10:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Some of the artwork
on Planet One that lined

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:28.240 align:middle line:84%
the streets, if you can imagine
the Jules Verne industrialized

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:84%
sub and all the dials and
brass and a very interesting

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and unique mechanisms, some of
the artwork that these artists

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.170 align:middle line:90%
produced were like a--

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.630 align:middle line:84%
it truly was a work
of art and inspiring

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:56.140 align:middle line:84%
in that it incorporated a
certain machine materialism

00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:00.450 align:middle line:90%
with natural shapes.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And so that in itself
was an inspiring view.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.060 align:middle line:90%
And they were everywhere.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.268 align:middle line:90%
They were all over the place.

00:11:07.268 --> 00:11:08.898 align:middle line:84%
The whole city was
decorated with it.

00:11:08.898 --> 00:11:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: On an intelligence
level, how would you rate them?

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.880 align:middle line:90%
Equal to us?

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I would say that they
had every bit of intelligence

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:16.290 align:middle line:90%
as we did.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: How
about on Planet Two?

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:18.610 align:middle line:90%
Same thing?

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Same thing.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.320 align:middle line:90%
Planet Two was the same way.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: How about
the Insectoids?

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.430 align:middle line:90%
Were they intelligent?

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Very.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.397 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Very intelligent.

00:11:24.397 --> 00:11:25.850 align:middle line:90%
And the cyclopians?

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yep.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.060 align:middle line:90%
They also were.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Again,
comparable to us today?

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yep.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And they
only have one eye.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Mm-hm.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So they don't have
three dimensional vision?

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Nope.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: That would seem
that humans and the Insectoids

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.550 align:middle line:84%
would have a great
advantage over them.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So the cyclopians,
because they only

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.990 align:middle line:84%
had a single eye, eliminated
their depth perception.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Now in place of that,
their empathic abilities

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.660 align:middle line:90%
and being able to feel--

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:01.270 align:middle line:84%
and when I asked about
that, their ability

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:06.820 align:middle line:84%
to energetically feel
things in their environment

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.340 align:middle line:84%
was how they explained that's
how they compensated for it.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The Insectoids
had something

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.840 align:middle line:84%
of a leg up because of their
developed telepathic abilities.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.610 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:26.390 align:middle line:84%
The process of carrying on a
conversation between two people

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:30.970 align:middle line:84%
requires thinking,
communicating internally

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.090 align:middle line:84%
to your voice box and your mouth
and your lips and your tongue,

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.370 align:middle line:90%
and then forming the words.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:37.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a process.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you can
remove that entire need

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.860 align:middle line:84%
for the communication
to happen, you

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.990 align:middle line:84%
have a lot faster,
clearer, communication.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Sure.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And so along with
the ability to communicate

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:59.450 align:middle line:84%
in a language, you can also
communicate with images,

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:03.470 align:middle line:84%
with feelings, with a
whole host of other things

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:07.298 align:middle line:84%
that are cut out of the
act of just talking.

00:13:07.298 --> 00:13:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: I see what you mean.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I see what
you mean, literally.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Literally.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.430 align:middle line:84%
So you think that
would have given

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.830 align:middle line:84%
the Insectoids a great
advantage in the war

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.030 align:middle line:90%
and that they would win?

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Absolutely.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.933 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: How come they didn't?

00:13:17.933 --> 00:13:19.425 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: The numbers.

00:13:19.425 --> 00:13:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: They
overwhelmed them.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well the Insectoids were
outnumbered by the cyclopians

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.490 align:middle line:90%
and the humanoids.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, all three
were residents of Planet Three.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And so while they had reached
a tenuous coexistence,

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:84%
there were still
conflicts at the borders

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:48.450 align:middle line:84%
or over certain territories or
over certain resource rights.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.590 align:middle line:90%
And so they're one against two.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why they
hadn't been destroyed,

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.990 align:middle line:84%
I think, it was because they
had their telepathic abilities,

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:07.230 align:middle line:84%
which meant that they were
able to also monitor, read,

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:13.510 align:middle line:84%
hear what the humanoids and
the cyclopians never said.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So it definitely
gave them a huge leg

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:21.360 align:middle line:84%
up in intelligence and
all number of fields.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: We strategize in our
wars and everything according

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.240 align:middle line:90%
to our abilities--

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.220 align:middle line:84%
how fast we can run,
how good we can shoot,

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.930 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of thing.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.890 align:middle line:84%
The Insectoids are a completely
different species than us.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.965 align:middle line:84%
So what was the
difference in the way

00:14:36.965 --> 00:14:40.543 align:middle line:84%
that they strategized as opposed
to how we would strategize?

00:14:40.543 --> 00:14:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: One of the
very important things

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:44.160 align:middle line:84%
to keep in mind
right off the bat is

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:52.520 align:middle line:84%
that what is considered to be
logic and reason to a humanoid

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:59.030 align:middle line:84%
is not the case when it
comes to an alien species,

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.780 align:middle line:84%
even if it's a alien
humanoid, but especially so

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.570 align:middle line:90%
for an alien insectoid.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.970 align:middle line:84%
You have in the
alien insectoid race

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:14.210 align:middle line:84%
a entity that
thinks differently.

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.660 align:middle line:90%
They have psychic abilities.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:22.750 align:middle line:84%
They have the ability to climb
up walls and on ceilings.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Their entire development
through the eons

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.490 align:middle line:90%
followed a different track--

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:33.820 align:middle line:84%
different religions,
different spiritual beliefs.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Taking into account that it
is a vastly different way

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:43.120 align:middle line:84%
of thinking, their approach
to it and to tactics

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.930 align:middle line:84%
is going to be based on
trying to take advantage

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:52.930 align:middle line:84%
of their strengths and trying
to take advantage of the enemy's

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:54.460 align:middle line:90%
weaknesses.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.920 align:middle line:90%
Now what are their strengths?

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Some of their strengths would
be in that their communications,

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:06.070 align:middle line:84%
taking advantage of
dark, taking advantage

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:12.530 align:middle line:84%
of ambush, in which they were
able to have one scout placed

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:17.150 align:middle line:84%
or positioned for another group
or team that never even had

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:21.730 align:middle line:84%
to lay eye on the ambush
site because they had

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:26.080 align:middle line:84%
that feed through one
of their other soldiers

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.220 align:middle line:90%
or their other individuals.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Their tactics are going
to be wrapped around--

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.770 align:middle line:84%
since they do see in a
different light spectrum,

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:38.120 align:middle line:84%
they are able to see on an
infrared in complete darkness.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.190 align:middle line:84%
They don't need
starlight to do it,

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:43.220 align:middle line:84%
so they can take advantage
of either underground or

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.260 align:middle line:90%
subterranean combat.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.490 align:middle line:84%
They operate a lot more
easily in darkness.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:84%
So they would confine themselves
to those types of situations

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and scenarios, where they
can take full advantage

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.470 align:middle line:90%
of those tactical strengths.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Humans
and all hominids

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.210 align:middle line:84%
have what is called
the vagus nerve system.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:09.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a system in the
brain, and it connects

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.180 align:middle line:90%
and makes us empathetic.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.411 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:17:12.411 --> 00:17:14.119 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: One of the
reasons that humans

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:17.930 align:middle line:84%
have survived and thrived is
because of the vagus nerve

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.430 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:23.450 align:middle line:84%
We cooperate with each
other, and it helps us.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Birds and insects do not
have the vagus nerve system,

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.360 align:middle line:84%
so they don't have the
ability to cooperate.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.680 align:middle line:84%
It's just not built
into their system.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.680 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying that
these Insectoids actually

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.740 align:middle line:84%
did have empathy
and could cooperate.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just wondering, are
they maybe more humanoid

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:90%
than we really think?

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.485 align:middle line:90%
Or are they pure insects?

00:17:42.485 --> 00:17:44.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what did
they appear to you?

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:51.350 align:middle line:84%
They appeared with their own
version of a star pattern.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
their ancient DNA

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.810 align:middle line:90%
had been tampered with?

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:57.830 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And considering that all
three planets mentioned

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:05.405 align:middle line:84%
star travelers in some
of their old writings,

00:18:05.405 --> 00:18:08.180 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me that there
is a good chance that that

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.790 align:middle line:90%
is exactly what happened.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Now the empathy for their own
kind was definitely present.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:22.110 align:middle line:84%
If I had ever doubted
that, my being a prisoner

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:27.540 align:middle line:84%
and sharing a cell with
a mother and a daughter

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.620 align:middle line:84%
surely showed that to me, that
they were capable of empathy

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.395 align:middle line:84%
and caring for and looking
after their own kind.

00:18:34.395 --> 00:18:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Do these
Insectoids walk upright?

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They do.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Do they have
forearms like we have?

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They have
insect-jointed forearms.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.030 align:middle line:90%
They have reverse-jointed legs--

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.852 align:middle line:90%
or knees, I should say.

00:18:53.852 --> 00:18:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Their joints are closer to
a grasshopper's joints than

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.690 align:middle line:90%
a humanoid's.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Their eyes have a highly
reflective silver color

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.040 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Their blood, whereas humans'
blood has iron in its content

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.580 align:middle line:84%
which accounts
for the red color,

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.400 align:middle line:84%
their blood has
cobalt, which accounts

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.520 align:middle line:84%
for the deep blue
color of their blood.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Are
they blue-skinned?

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: What
color is their skin?

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Bright
yellowish green skin.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.070 align:middle line:90%
And they're small.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.917 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're--

00:19:29.917 --> 00:19:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: How tall?

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: --4 and 1/2 feet
tall as the tallest.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Are they fast?

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes, very fast.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Can they fly?

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Nope.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Did they
have technology?

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They had technology on
par with the other two races

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:47.550 align:middle line:84%
on Planet Three, which was to
say that it was not beginning,

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.415 align:middle line:90%
but progressing industrially.

00:19:49.415 --> 00:19:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Are they still
fighting on Planet Three?

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I have no idea.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.210 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.690 align:middle line:84%
When I left there after
my shuttle was shot down,

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:01.350 align:middle line:84%
the alien invasion
had not started,

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:05.520 align:middle line:84%
and they were still trying to
get these three opposing forces

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.780 align:middle line:90%
to work together.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Were
they really trying

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.630 align:middle line:84%
to get the three opposing
forces to work together?

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:10.922 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's a good question.

00:20:10.922 --> 00:20:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Were they trying to
wipe one out or limit?

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, on the
prior two planets,

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.660 align:middle line:84%
the population reduction
was in the billions.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Wow.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So getting rid of
an entire race would not

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.800 align:middle line:84%
be beyond the scope of what
they were capable of doing

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.960 align:middle line:90%
or were interested in.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So you say that
there are billions of people

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.950 align:middle line:90%
who died in these wars.

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.672 align:middle line:84%
Is it the first planet was
the war with the werewolves?

00:20:33.672 --> 00:20:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:84%
The werewolf invasion and the
fighting off of that invasion

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.585 align:middle line:84%
is what's responsible for
the deaths of those people.

00:20:44.585 --> 00:20:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: How
did you eventually

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.350 align:middle line:84%
defeat the
werewolves, since they

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.787 align:middle line:90%
were so fierce and vicious?

00:20:48.787 --> 00:20:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The way we
were able to defeat

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:84%
them was through the use
of a very limited amount

00:20:55.050 --> 00:21:01.170 align:middle line:84%
of advanced technology, because
the war was at the point

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:04.650 align:middle line:84%
where it was either
lose it or use it.

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And the powers that be
decided that they would,

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:13.590 align:middle line:84%
in a very limited fashion,
use, for instance, more

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.510 align:middle line:90%
advanced explosives.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.250 align:middle line:84%
They didn't allow
us to use our combat

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.980 align:middle line:90%
suits or our advanced weapons.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Why not?

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.446 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Because they didn't
think they needed to.

00:21:23.446 --> 00:21:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Did they
have burial rituals?

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They did.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:36.540 align:middle line:84%
The unfortunate aspect of
the needs of combat tactics

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.840 align:middle line:84%
meant that a lot of
times, those ceremonies--

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.600 align:middle line:84%
we weren't able to fulfill
that because you can't

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:51.140 align:middle line:84%
take three hours out of your
mission to go through a burial

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.025 align:middle line:90%
ceremony.

00:21:52.025 --> 00:21:53.990 align:middle line:90%
It ends up being a mass burial.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And we keep track of
it and write it down

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:59.910 align:middle line:84%
and keep records of how many are
there, if you can count them.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And part of the cleanup
process on Calidus Three

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:08.930 align:middle line:84%
involved going around
to all the battle sites

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and collecting the
hybrids, and that

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:16.490 align:middle line:84%
includes some of
Earth's corporations

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:18.838 align:middle line:84%
coming and collecting
parts and pieces.

00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So you're saying they
would pick up the werewolves

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.750 align:middle line:90%
and then back engineer them?

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Picking up
pieces, everything

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:84%
from fluid regulators to joints
to ball and socket connections

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:39.980 align:middle line:84%
to their visual cortex
and how those were made,

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:84%
everything from the
tip of their ears

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.120 align:middle line:84%
down to the bottom
of their claws.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.730 align:middle line:84%
If you've got something
that's advanced,

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:50.930 align:middle line:84%
and that was clearly
an advanced creation--

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
important to note

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:56.690 align:middle line:84%
that the difference between
extraterrestrial biological

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:01.640 align:middle line:84%
entities and these created
hybrids, which are what I'd

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.180 align:middle line:84%
encountered on Planet
One and Planet Two

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:10.550 align:middle line:84%
in the technical sense are not
ETs, they're hybrid creations.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:16.200 align:middle line:84%
So being able to go and
collect those parts and pieces

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:21.300 align:middle line:84%
are of extreme value to certain
organizations or corporations

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.330 align:middle line:84%
in that they can now
incorporate the ideas

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:28.080 align:middle line:84%
and thoughts behind
these mechanical joints

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.710 align:middle line:84%
into a surgical
knee replacement or

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:37.910 align:middle line:84%
into an augmented
or assisted strength

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:42.820 align:middle line:84%
attachment for a human
or a robotic arm,

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.930 align:middle line:90%
any number of applications.

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So
you've been implying

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:48.310 align:middle line:84%
that the Dracos are
really at the heart,

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.700 align:middle line:84%
especially of the werewolves
and the attack on Planet One.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever meet
or see a Draco?

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Thankfully, no.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.018 align:middle line:84%
I did not have to work with
them or interact with them.

00:23:58.018 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Why do
you say thankfully?

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Because
I'd just rather not

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:02.290 align:middle line:84%
have to deal with that
type of negative energies.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:03.873 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Have you
heard about people

00:24:03.873 --> 00:24:05.620 align:middle line:90%
who had interacted with them?

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:11.080 align:middle line:84%
The Mars-German friend that
shared the intelligence

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:15.660 align:middle line:84%
with me about the Draco
and their involvement, part

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.850 align:middle line:84%
of the communication
process that we

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:20.700 align:middle line:84%
had learned during
our IDARF training

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.670 align:middle line:84%
was similar to what I
had mentioned before

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:28.170 align:middle line:84%
with the Insectoids, being able
to psychically share images.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.210 align:middle line:84%
That was also part
of the protocols

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:31.950 align:middle line:84%
that we were
trained on and being

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:36.560 align:middle line:84%
able to share not just
communications, but images back

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.360 align:middle line:90%
and forth.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: And so the images
that he had shared with me

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:42.130 align:middle line:90%
of the Draco--

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:46.920 align:middle line:84%
of their negotiations,
of their taking

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:50.790 align:middle line:84%
the multiple prisoners
from the Antarctic Germans

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:53.550 align:middle line:84%
during the exchange,
what they looked like,

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:57.960 align:middle line:84%
the feelings that came
along with the experience--

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.680 align:middle line:84%
are not something that I
would want or wish on anybody,

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.920 align:middle line:84%
least of which I would
want to experience myself.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So from a standpoint
of interacting with them,

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:16.930 align:middle line:84%
with that negative entity, the
Mars-Germans, a select few,

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.040 align:middle line:90%
had done that.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And the exchange of
information with me from Johann

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.290 align:middle line:84%
carried all kinds of
the feelings associated

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:28.552 align:middle line:90%
with having to do that.

00:25:28.552 --> 00:25:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Did Johann have any
interactions with the Draco?

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:32.552 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: He'd seen
them at a distance.

00:25:32.552 --> 00:25:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: He had.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: But he had not had to
directly interact with them.

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:43.790 align:middle line:84%
His family on Mars
back in Newarsburg.

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:49.850 align:middle line:84%
His family were fairly
highly connected,

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:55.190 align:middle line:84%
which accounts for his
placement into IDARF

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:56.990 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
he wanted to do,

00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:01.040 align:middle line:84%
so he was able to make
those arrangements.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So he had family members
that had worked directly

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.800 align:middle line:90%
with the Draco.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And the way he'd
explained it to me

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.970 align:middle line:84%
was that the Draco aren't
interested in talking

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:12.770 align:middle line:90%
to everybody.

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:16.250 align:middle line:84%
They will only talk to
very limited few humans

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:84%
because they see them as
far below their stature

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:24.410 align:middle line:84%
and not worthy of
an interaction.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.990 align:middle line:84%
So most of the
interactions with humans

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:28.860 align:middle line:90%
were only when they had to.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And when they had to, it was
with those that are in charge.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Did that change after
you defeated the werewolves?

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.275 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: The Draco?

00:26:37.275 --> 00:26:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Part of their plan was to
have the planetary population

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.110 align:middle line:84%
reduced, even if it meant
their proxy werewolves were

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:47.680 align:middle line:90%
destroyed.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.100 align:middle line:90%
That was all part of their plan.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Why would they
want the population reduced?

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Because it provided
a motivating factor

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:59.120 align:middle line:84%
for the remaining population
that were left alive to agree

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and consent to whatever it was
that they were being asked.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: What is your
strongest takeaway experience

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.490 align:middle line:90%
from dealing with these ETs?

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Which ET group had the
most influence on you

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.340 align:middle line:90%
through your life afterwards?

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The ET group that
had the largest effect on me

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:25.710 align:middle line:84%
would hands down be the
civilization on Calidus Three

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.010 align:middle line:84%
because I'd been able to
experience both the fighting

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.870 align:middle line:90%
and the rebuilding.

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And as part of the growth
process for me personally

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:40.680 align:middle line:84%
in trying to raise
my own vibrations

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and approach to
interactions with people,

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:50.760 align:middle line:84%
maintaining a positive attitude,
staying hopeful, and not

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.750 align:middle line:84%
focusing on the
negative aspects that

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:59.250 align:middle line:84%
could be anything from stubbing
your toe to a flat tire,

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.810 align:middle line:84%
not carrying those
things with me,

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:07.910 align:middle line:84%
is the people that
survived that war.

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.230 align:middle line:90%
They had a choice to make.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:16.850 align:middle line:84%
They could either wear all of
that pain on their shoulders,

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:21.470 align:middle line:84%
or they could face it
and work on clearing it

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:26.690 align:middle line:84%
and continue their lives with
an aspect of hope and love

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:28.380 align:middle line:90%
and happiness.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, that was probably
one of the biggest factors

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.230 align:middle line:90%
that I'd encountered.

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And it changed me
drastically after seeing

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:45.950 align:middle line:84%
that, in that when I had
left that duty station

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and continued on to the 333rd
training regiment, in which I

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:56.640 align:middle line:84%
became one of the trainers,
it affected how I approached

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.870 align:middle line:84%
my training of tomorrow's
soldiers, the ones

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:05.660 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to be going
out within the next year or two.

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And that as much as I could, I
did everything within my power

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:19.780 align:middle line:84%
to try and impart on them the
need for facing challenges,

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.170 align:middle line:84%
identifying what
those challenges mean

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:29.050 align:middle line:84%
to them individually, being
able to clear that so that

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:33.820 align:middle line:84%
through integrity and
honesty and compassion,

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:38.950 align:middle line:84%
being able to move forward
without having that

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:40.930 align:middle line:84%
and the experiences
they were inevitably

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:44.110 align:middle line:84%
going to go through wear them
down, weigh them down, and hold

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:45.650 align:middle line:90%
them back.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Would you
go back if you could?

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Would I go back to
Planet One, Two, or Three?

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:54.190 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Would I go back to help be
a part of some false flag

00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:59.430 align:middle line:90%
operation?

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:00.995 align:middle line:90%
Not in a million years.

00:30:00.995 --> 00:30:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, Jason, thank
you for coming on the show.

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Really appreciate it.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Thank you,
Jay, for having me.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.187 align:middle line:84%
I'm super appreciative of
the opportunity to be here.

00:30:10.187 --> 00:30:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And you've been
watching "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jay Weidner.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.240 align:middle line:90%
And thanks for watching.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Coming this season
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.120 align:middle line:10%
where people share their
clandestine involvement with

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.410 align:middle line:10%
government agencies,
the military,

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:26.090 align:middle line:10%

unless the tissue from the craft
and the tissue from the person

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.220 align:middle line:90%
who had the craft are together.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: You keep them busy.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:36.870 align:middle line:90%
You keep them distracted.

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And you keep them
occupied elsewhere.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And then before you
know it, there's

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.150 align:middle line:84%
an entire system in place
that's controlling them.
