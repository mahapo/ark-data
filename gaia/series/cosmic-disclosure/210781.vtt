00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on Cosmic Disclosure,
we're with Richard Doty,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.980 align:middle line:10%
a retired Special Agent who
served in the Air Force Office

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.420 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.260 align:middle line:90%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Today we speak about what is
going on with the government

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.280 align:middle line:90%
and disclosure.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you know about the
classified portion of the UP

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.940 align:middle line:84%
report that was shared with
some senators and congressmen?

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's select groups
of researchers out there

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.220 align:middle line:90%
who've gotten together.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are quasi
connected to the government.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And they're being supportive
of the Congressional,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.140 align:middle line:84%
both the House side
and the Senate side,

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.470 align:middle line:84%
in the investigation
and future disclosure

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:84%
of information pertaining to
extraterrestrial, UFO, UAP

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.170 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, this report
was accomplished

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.920 align:middle line:84%
by a number of different
people, both from within

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.170 align:middle line:90%
and from outside the government.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>> So they had help.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>> They had a lot of help,
people gathering information,

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.480 align:middle line:84%
old reports, and I'll talk
about that here in a minute,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and trying to put it all
together and make a sensible

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.260 align:middle line:90%
disclosure at some point.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And how they did this is, they
went out and talked and spoke

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.450 align:middle line:84%
with intelligence
officers like myself.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, they had
some of our old reports.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And ironically, the reports were
so redacted, which amazed me.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.080 align:middle line:84%
As I'm trying to explain
this report to a government

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:84%
official, but he's looking
at a redacted report.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>> A different one.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Now I'm not sure if I can
tell him what I know about

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.230 align:middle line:84%
the report because
I was the author.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.789 align:middle line:90%
It was my report.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:90%
I authored the report.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And what I could tell
him over the phone?

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.960 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, we got
together in person.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And we shared everything we
could share with him regarding

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.080 align:middle line:90%
these reports.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.680 align:middle line:90%
There was just not me.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.590 align:middle line:84%
There were many other
intelligence officers

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.440 align:middle line:84%
both from Officer
Naval intelligence,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.770 align:middle line:84%
from Air Force intelligence,
from Defense Intelligence

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Agency, from the Central
Intelligence Agency, case

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.100 align:middle line:84%
officer reports,
CIA reports that

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.190 align:middle line:84%
went back as far as
back in the 1970s

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.940 align:middle line:84%
that were experiencing
contacts inside Laos,

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.810 align:middle line:84%
about these strange beings
that were being encountered

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.810 align:middle line:84%
by local villagers
who were then reported

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:84%
to the paramilitary case
officer, the CIA guy.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Such a massive conglomerate
to control all that.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Plus as you said, the different
agents and officers, but ones

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.810 align:middle line:90%
that are not around anymore.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Who can actually
talk about that?

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>> That's right because a
lot of these case officers,

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.390 align:middle line:84%
paramilitary case officers,
intelligence officers,

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:90%
OSI agents, they're gone.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.180 align:middle line:90%
They die.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.220 align:middle line:90%
So they're not around.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:90%
The reports are still there.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And ironically, the
Air Force Office

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.700 align:middle line:84%
of Special Investigations
or even the CIA

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:90%
won't declassify these things.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>> They're holding on to it.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's probably some
reasons why that I'm not aware

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.170 align:middle line:90%
of.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And so they're trying to push
into this report everything

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.910 align:middle line:84%
that makes sense, where the
public can make sense of it

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:42.870 align:middle line:90%
and accept it.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Now that in itself
is a major problem

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.200 align:middle line:84%
because you're trying
to satisfy society

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.900 align:middle line:84%
that has so many different
likes and dislikes.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And especially nowadays, nobody
can agree on almost anything.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Not even Congress can agree
on anything, let alone

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.170 align:middle line:84%
the American people,
who the government

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.640 align:middle line:90%
wants to give them disclosure.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So I think the
rational way that they

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.269 align:middle line:84%
decided to do this was
start historically speaking.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So they decided, we'll go
back to that point in history,

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.590 align:middle line:84%
where we, the Earth,
first realized

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.680 align:middle line:84%
that we might be visited
by extraterrestrials.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the incident
over Washington by Arnold,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.140 align:middle line:84%
who saw these things flying
that he called flying saucers,

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:84%
is before Roswell,
slightly before.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And then the Roswell
incident happened.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the information
about the Roswell incident,

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:84%
the Roswell and Corona crash,
is known to the public.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a select
number of people

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.360 align:middle line:84%
within the government that's
involved in this disclosure

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.760 align:middle line:90%
actually saw this film.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.370 align:middle line:84%
They sat down, and
it was shown to them.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Now the original
film was 32 minutes.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.240 align:middle line:84%
This film was recorded by a
nonprofessional photographer,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:84%
an army officer who
was a lieutenant.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.830 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't trained
in photography.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.720 align:middle line:90%
It was 32 minutes.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.410 align:middle line:84%
They cut out 15 minutes because
that 15 minutes that they

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.960 align:middle line:84%
cut out was nothing
more than views

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.943 align:middle line:90%
of the ground, Earth, the sky.

00:05:28.943 --> 00:05:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>> That's good to
know for the audience,

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.110 align:middle line:84%
so later on, when
it's available,

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.820 align:middle line:84%
it's not something
they're hiding.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.400 align:middle line:84%
So when they cut it down to
the relevant portions of it,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.930 align:middle line:90%
it was 17 minutes.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And that shows
inside of the tent,

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.700 align:middle line:84%
the navigational controls,
the hand controls,

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.720 align:middle line:84%
the communications
device, the ET bodies.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.630 align:middle line:84%
A lot of this has
already been leaked out.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.360 align:middle line:84%
It's already been on
the internet years ago.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.610 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one
particular piece of it

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.210 align:middle line:84%
showing the inside of the
tent and President Truman

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.640 align:middle line:90%
was leaked by Stan Friedman.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Somebody gave him that
portion of the film.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.080 align:middle line:84%
But the pictures of the bodies
of the extraterrestrials,

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.200 align:middle line:84%
the one live one sitting next
to a rock, that's all in there.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So they are choosing at
their own discretion a timeline

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.560 align:middle line:84%
of specifics that can
be, I'll say, proven.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the plan.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.600 align:middle line:84%
What the eventual disclosure
is, we don't know.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.720 align:middle line:84%
But the full
consensus of everyone

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.320 align:middle line:84%
that I've ever spoken to--
one particular senator who

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.050 align:middle line:84%
is prominent in
this, he's saying

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.370 align:middle line:84%
that the best place
to start is Roswell.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Now I'm sure they're going to
talk about the Kingman incident

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.460 align:middle line:84%
because that's a
prominent incident.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.250 align:middle line:10%
That is, there's a lot of
evidence to the Kingman

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.520 align:middle line:10%
incident and others,
crash sites in Nevada,

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.540 align:middle line:10%
crash sites in Arizona,
crash sites in Wyoming,

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.970 align:middle line:10%
crash site in Montana.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.720 align:middle line:84%
These crashes, there's
well-documented cases.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Wendelle Stevens, Lieutenant
Colonel Wendelle Stevens

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.020 align:middle line:84%
retired, was on the
first crash recovery

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:84%
team, the down
aircraft recovery team.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.450 align:middle line:84%
He documented so
many different things

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.340 align:middle line:90%
that now the government has.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
Wendelle's passed away.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And even somebody
that could have

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.930 align:middle line:84%
supported that, Robert Dean, his
sidekick, has also passed away.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.110 align:middle line:84%
So we're losing a
lot of research here.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.550 align:middle line:90%
And so we have the reports.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.410 align:middle line:84%
We have the documentation that
the Air Force or the Space

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.480 align:middle line:90%
Command has somewhat released.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.400 align:middle line:90%
But then again, it hasn't been.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.570 align:middle line:90%
It's still redacted.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>> How many of these reports
do you believe are going to be

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.980 align:middle line:90%
added to this timeline?

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And also, the timeline
itself, what's

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:84%
going to be the latest that
they're going to put on that

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.370 align:middle line:90%
timeline from today?

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:54.490 align:middle line:90%
I wish I knew.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure it's in there.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could disclose the
entire classified, everything

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.310 align:middle line:90%
that's in that that I know of.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know it all.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I don't
know everything,

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.180 align:middle line:84%
but there's a lot of
information about current events

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.640 align:middle line:90%
that might come into play.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.450 align:middle line:84%
For instance, one of
the things that I've

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.720 align:middle line:84%
talked about on this program
and Cosmic Disclosure

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.160 align:middle line:84%
is what the DIA, Defense
Intelligence Agency,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.810 align:middle line:84%
disclosed regarding
known ET races.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And there are five of
them that I talk about.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.330 align:middle line:90%
I did programming about it.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.640 align:middle line:90%
But now they're talking about 7.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.990 align:middle line:90%
There's two extras.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about those two.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.929 align:middle line:90%
I never was briefed into them.

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:50.560 align:middle line:84%
But sometime or somehow between
1985, '86 time frame, and 2023,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.730 align:middle line:84%
two more extraterrestrial
races are

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.760 align:middle line:84%
known to have been in contact
with us, the United States

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.080 align:middle line:90%
government, at least Earth.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.955 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying,
maybe our government.

00:09:00.955 --> 00:09:03.880 align:middle line:84%
It maybe some other
government that we know of.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.368 align:middle line:90%
So now there's seven.

00:09:05.368 --> 00:09:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Now I know there's
people out there--

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>> It's growing.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>> --will jump up and yell and
scream that there's thousands

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:11.770 align:middle line:90%
of races.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:16.270 align:middle line:90%
Well, I know now of seven.

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully they're
going to disclose that.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
how they're going

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:27.130 align:middle line:84%
to do that because
somehow they're

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.740 align:middle line:84%
going to have to do
this in a way that

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:35.710 align:middle line:84%
is acceptable to the people
because there could be panic.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.060 align:middle line:90%
It could be--

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a lot of information.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And plus, the
religious aspects of it.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.200 align:middle line:90%
They have to think about that.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure they have, people
within the Vatican and other--

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.210 align:middle line:84%
in fact, I know they do
have a religious people that

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:51.080 align:middle line:90%
are working on this.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm not working on it with them,
but I know that they're there.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:58.325 align:middle line:84%
And so I just assume that
there must be figuring out, OK,

00:09:58.325 --> 00:09:59.950 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to
tell us that there's

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:04.780 align:middle line:84%
seven extraterrestrial races
that the Earth has contact

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.220 align:middle line:84%
with, how's the public
going to react to this?

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.210 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:84%
The five that I've spoken
about, and then you

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:90%
have these other two races.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.460 align:middle line:84%
One is humanoid, apparently
come from the Pleiades.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.350 align:middle line:90%
And they look human.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.670 align:middle line:90%
They look exactly like a human.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.480 align:middle line:84%
They have long hair, and their
ears are different somehow.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
how exactly how.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And the seventh one is a small
and robust brown-skinned,

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.593 align:middle line:84%
hardened skinned, and
hardened features.

00:10:38.593 --> 00:10:39.510 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's still skin.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not like an insectoid
hard layer like an extraderm.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.130 align:middle line:84%
As I understand,
it's just hardened

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:90%
and a different texture.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I think the person that
was explaining this

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:56.250 align:middle line:84%
to me said, as if they
came from a planet that

00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:03.180 align:middle line:84%
had a rough atmosphere,
that maybe a brighter sun,

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.190 align:middle line:84%
and there's somehow
protected their skin.

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And that that's why
their skin is hardened.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And that that's what
was explained to me.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen actual
pictures of it yet.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Now as I understand,
that we might already--

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.590 align:middle line:84%
there's already a lot of
evidence from the past

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:25.080 align:middle line:84%
that we've known about
these two other races.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.460 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know about them.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.130 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard about those.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:35.220 align:middle line:84%
I've heard about the
humanoids, the blond-haired.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:39.310 align:middle line:84%
But they could have been mixed
up with one of the other five

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:90%
races.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, yes.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So is the release by
the government entity,

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.513 align:middle line:84%
whichever entity
it's going to be,

00:11:46.513 --> 00:11:48.930 align:middle line:84%
whether it's going to be a
congressional one or a military

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:52.320 align:middle line:84%
one, whether you're going to
include these two or describe

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.630 align:middle line:84%
exactly who they are or
where they come from.

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.050 align:middle line:84%
That's the question I
wish I could answer.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.570 align:middle line:84%
I wish I had the
answers right now.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>> With the mention of
these two new species,

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.830 align:middle line:84%
have you heard anything
about their intentions,

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.500 align:middle line:90%
their benevolence?

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>> They're both benevolent.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:90%
They're nonhostile.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.530 align:middle line:10%
And they have contributed
to our technology.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And who are they working
with with that then?

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I would think DIA or DARPA
or an entity within DARPA.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.970 align:middle line:84%
DARPA is an organization
that contracts things out.

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.990 align:middle line:84%
But they do have
a secret branch.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.900 align:middle line:90%
You can look it up.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.000 align:middle line:84%
There's no explanation
of what it is.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's I think
the ET portion.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.930 align:middle line:84%
There's some maybe connections
between maybe ambassadors

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.750 align:middle line:84%
from an ET race that
comes here and works

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.660 align:middle line:84%
in that particular
arena to try to advance

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.970 align:middle line:84%
our technology from
their technology

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.850 align:middle line:84%
or allow us to understand
their technology.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Of course, as I
said earlier, they

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:84%
have different science
and different math.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And they come from
different planets.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.700 align:middle line:84%
They probably have different
elements, not all our elements,

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.260 align:middle line:90%
probably most of our--

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.160 align:middle line:84%
on the periodic table,
118 or whatever it is now.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.020 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure they
probably have others.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And they've probably
developed, and I know this,

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:19.920 align:middle line:84%
they've developed ways to
combine different elements

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.200 align:middle line:90%
in ways we can't today.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And we can't combine
one particular element

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.090 align:middle line:90%
with another.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.320 align:middle line:90%
They have methods to do that.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.980 align:middle line:10%
And if you can do that, and
there's scientists out there

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:36.030 align:middle line:10%
that know this,
if you can advance

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:41.280 align:middle line:10%
our understanding of the
elements, such as argon gas

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:10%
is the most plentiful
gas that we have,

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.780 align:middle line:10%
how you can combine
that with another gas

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:53.940 align:middle line:10%
and make something that they can
make that can propel something.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.530 align:middle line:90%
And we can't yet.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.890 align:middle line:84%
So these are the things that
I think they're probably

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.340 align:middle line:90%
trying to help us.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And we probably have
ambassadors there,

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.590 align:middle line:90%
and they have ambassadors here.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Everyone's getting trained.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody's getting trained.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Back to the two
types of species,

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.300 align:middle line:84%
does the government actually
refer to them as Pleiadians?

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:21.140 align:middle line:84%
The government classifies
the one or the sixth group

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:90%
as Pleiadians.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:28.130 align:middle line:84%
As I understand, we had a
Pleiadian craft in captivity

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:29.600 align:middle line:90%
at Area 51.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.650 align:middle line:90%
Now I don't know when we got it.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:34.430 align:middle line:10%
But it was some years ago,
probably during the time

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.500 align:middle line:10%
I was at Area 51 or before that.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we found it
at a crash site.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:39.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>> You've seen
that documentation?

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I saw that.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.500 align:middle line:90%
We have one.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Now jump ahead, now we
have someone, the species.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.020 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians, we
have their craft.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.400 align:middle line:90%
We can't understand it.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Now we have them here to
explain that to us, at least try

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.840 align:middle line:84%
to assist us in
the understanding

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:05.780 align:middle line:84%
of their technology and how we
can reverse engineer or even

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.580 align:middle line:90%
use it in our benefit.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Not only are they helping us
in understanding technology,

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:19.850 align:middle line:84%
they want us to understand why
they are like us because they

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:20.660 align:middle line:90%
look human.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.760 align:middle line:90%
They're human-looking entities.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And although I don't
know this right now,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.010 align:middle line:84%
but I think they're providing us
with information that we could

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.250 align:middle line:84%
maybe check their DNA
and so forth and so on,

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.730 align:middle line:90%
medically speaking.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:39.570 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure that's the next
stage if they haven't already

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:40.370 align:middle line:90%
done that.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and see the
lineage possibly,

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.130 align:middle line:84%
if we are associated
with them or vise versa.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:50.150 align:middle line:84%
While mentioning these species,
what's the population of them?

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.650 align:middle line:90%
Is there 1, 2?

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.647 align:middle line:84%
Is there 10,000 of
these beings here?

00:15:54.647 --> 00:15:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:59.240 align:middle line:90%
I asked my source.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.570 align:middle line:84%
During a conference call, many
people asked the same question.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.100 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't answered.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.240 align:middle line:90%
They're here.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.370 align:middle line:90%
They are here.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:11.780 align:middle line:84%
I would interpret that
to mean more than one

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:84%
are here assisting
on planet Earth.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where they live.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they're
living in an outer atmosphere

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.360 align:middle line:90%
or they travel back and forth.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have a bungalow out
of Area 51 or some other place.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.860 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not joking about that.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have facilities for
these ET races to live here.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:42.800 align:middle line:84%
I know that at one point, when
I was at Area 51 in the '80s,

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.420 align:middle line:84%
we had a containment facility
called S2 annex, which

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.520 align:middle line:90%
was northwest of Papoose Lake.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And they had some
entities there.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the things that was
asked during this conference

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:02.150 align:middle line:84%
call by somebody
other than me was,

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:09.589 align:middle line:84%
what's common among
all the 7 entities that

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:12.720 align:middle line:84%
have visited Earth or that
we have had contact with?

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And the one common thing
is they all require water.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Water is a universal
need for the universe.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.359 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:28.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:28.159 --> 00:17:32.470 align:middle line:84%
So every planet has
some form of water,

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:37.050 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the same
concentration that ours is.

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:38.820 align:middle line:90%
Which there's some conjecture.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I know the five other
races and one particular,

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:46.870 align:middle line:84%
the Archquloids, their
water is a bit different.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:84%
They had maybe three parts
hydrogen or something

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.740 align:middle line:90%
to that effect.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.030 align:middle line:84%
But even the one
particular species

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.850 align:middle line:84%
that required a little
bit of methane to breathe,

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.770 align:middle line:90%
they still had water.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So I thought that
was ironic, that we

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:09.330 align:middle line:84%
do have a commonality
among at least the seven

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.130 align:middle line:90%
that we know of.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's water.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there any commonality with
DNA of these species and human

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:16.500 align:middle line:90%
DNA?

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe there is, but
I don't have the scientific

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.960 align:middle line:84%
background, nor did I have any
clearance to understand it.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, speaking amongst
intelligence officers

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:32.010 align:middle line:84%
around the coffee pot,
so to speak, and even

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.820 align:middle line:84%
in the conference rooms that
we're talking, that subject

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.460 align:middle line:90%
is constantly being brought up.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.040 align:middle line:90%
What's the commonality of DNA?

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Are we connected in any
way to any of these seven

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.690 align:middle line:90%
that we know of?

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:90%
And there is an answer to that.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.710 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately
I don't know it.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:54.220 align:middle line:84%
We do know that every
one of the species,

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:59.470 align:middle line:84%
or I should say the five species
that I knew about had DNA.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.600 align:middle line:90%
But their DNA strands--

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.530 align:middle line:90%
and I don't understand DNA.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.770 align:middle line:90%
So something's different.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:10.090 align:middle line:84%
As a trained
intelligence officers,

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:13.180 align:middle line:84%
one talking to another,
not being scientific,

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.610 align:middle line:84%
somebody said, the
strands are different.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:18.880 align:middle line:84%
They have DNA, but their
strands are different than ours.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Now I think one of the things
that we really have to look at

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:28.150 align:middle line:84%
is the Pleiades, the
blonds, they look so human,

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:32.110 align:middle line:84%
they must have something
extremely similar to ours.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.980 align:middle line:90%
And I can't wait to find out.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.130 align:middle line:90%
It only makes sense.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Back in the '90s,
in the projects,

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.150 align:middle line:84%
we did notice that
extraterrestrials

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.190 align:middle line:90%
had DNA, human DNA.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And humans had
certain percentages

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:46.810 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial DNA.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.150 align:middle line:90%
And that was way back then.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.700 align:middle line:84%
So today, I'm sure they
have special teams just

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.070 align:middle line:90%
for that and still searching.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:59.033 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, of course, this
brings up another area.

00:19:59.033 --> 00:20:00.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if we
want to go into that,

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.950 align:middle line:84%
is what we know
about humans walking

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:07.030 align:middle line:90%
this Earth with alien DNA.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.480 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole new arena now.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And that we know that
there's some people,

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:19.740 align:middle line:84%
unbeknownst to them,
have alien DNA.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's been proven.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.010 align:middle line:10%
I've been in cases
where this has happened,

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:29.330 align:middle line:10%
that a person being
tested for something

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.710 align:middle line:10%
is found to have known DNA.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Now the question there is,
I'm sure the viewers are

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.760 align:middle line:84%
going to say, well, what are
you talking about known DNA?

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Do I have it?

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>> We know what alien DNA is.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.130 align:middle line:90%
We know it because we had them.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:45.450 align:middle line:90%
We had five species.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.790 align:middle line:90%
We know what their DNA is.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, there's been
genetic scientists and others

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.350 align:middle line:84%
that have delved into this and
have done so much research.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:59.570 align:middle line:84%
There was countless number
of DARPA projects relating

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:00.370 align:middle line:90%
to this.

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And so we went out and
started testing people.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
we know that is being done

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:12.380 align:middle line:84%
is military recruits,
when they're

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.770 align:middle line:84%
going through basic training,
they get inoculated.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.080 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
they do when they're

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.350 align:middle line:84%
given these inoculations
is they take something

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:24.260 align:middle line:84%
from every single
one of the recruits.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.097 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:25.097 --> 00:21:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>> And they're testing it.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.070 align:middle line:90%
And what are they testing for?

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:29.850 align:middle line:90%
They're testing DNA.

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Now every military recruit now
gets a DNA test besides that.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.180 align:middle line:84%
But they're looking at
one particular thing.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.730 align:middle line:84%
They're looking at, is
there a particular band

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:44.510 align:middle line:84%
or whatever DNA,
I'm layman talking

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:50.167 align:middle line:84%
about DNA, something that
could identify them as alien.

00:21:50.167 --> 00:21:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>> They're trying to track
that lineage and find out who

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.980 align:middle line:90%
belongs to those first families.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's been spoken
about in books

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.410 align:middle line:84%
and by scientists, that
we are star people.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies and everything in
our bodies is from the stars.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:15.570 align:middle line:84%
This planet Earth is
made from the stars,

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.790 align:middle line:90%
made from things from all over.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:22.680 align:middle line:84%
This Earth, during its early
days, billions of years

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.910 align:middle line:84%
ago, was bombarded with
things from other parts

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And then we are
developed from here.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's also this theory
among some military scientists,

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and not just military,
there's civilian scientists,

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.620 align:middle line:84%
but I only know the
military portion of this.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:50.690 align:middle line:84%
I know the military scientists
have an idea, a theory,

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I should say a theory, that
human beings were planted here.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, were they planted here
by the Pleiadians, the Ebens?

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:01.270 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Rather than we being
developed from the apes

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:13.910 align:middle line:84%
and going through that
evolutionary process,

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:17.780 align:middle line:84%
they think, based on
DNA, based on another--

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:21.320 align:middle line:84%
many other things, that
we were placed here.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:25.010 align:middle line:84%
But there are some, and
I know that other groups,

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.760 align:middle line:84%
some scientists that I'm
very, very good friends with,

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Puthoff and
others, that believe

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:38.540 align:middle line:84%
that maybe the ape species
was somehow manipulated.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:44.030 align:middle line:84%
So the evolutionary process
of humans went through them.

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was manipulated by
an extraterrestrial race.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Now how do we explain--

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.330 align:middle line:90%
this is a question that I have.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:57.470 align:middle line:84%
How do we explain that
there's people out there, just

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.080 align:middle line:84%
normal everyday
people walking around,

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.680 align:middle line:84%
a secretary in an
office, a garbage

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:08.630 align:middle line:84%
collector or any human being,
and when they're tested,

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:10.770 align:middle line:90%
they have alien DNA?

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:12.720 align:middle line:90%
How do we explain that?

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.360 align:middle line:84%
How do we explain where
does it come from?

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that
they were developed

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.160 align:middle line:90%
through a hybrid process?

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.500 align:middle line:84%
A multitude of
species maybe possibly

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:29.040 align:middle line:84%
could have kept making different
hybridization programs.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's say we started out
as one segment of the DNA.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And then we got cross matched
with another hybridization

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:37.150 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And then another species
came to upgrade us.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.670 align:middle line:90%
And then another one came.

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:43.037 align:middle line:84%
So there is a possibility,
it's a multitude

00:24:43.037 --> 00:24:44.870 align:middle line:84%
of different species
is what I'm getting at.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>> That answers it.

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:46.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that answers that.

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.650 align:middle line:84%
It could very well
be that that's

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:52.160 align:middle line:84%
what these scientists
are talking about.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:57.140 align:middle line:84%
You can test 50 people, and
they all have plain human DNA.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And you go over here
and test these other 50,

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and some of them have alien
or they all have alien DNA.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.610 align:middle line:84%
They have some kind
of band or whatever.

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:09.020 align:middle line:90%
The testing is very specific.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.853 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you brought
that up for the viewers

00:25:10.853 --> 00:25:13.040 align:middle line:84%
because you just
can't go get tested

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.990 align:middle line:84%
to see if you're
an extraterrestrial

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.450 align:middle line:84%
or how much of that genetic
composition you have.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:20.300 align:middle line:84%
These are classified
genetic programs

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.040 align:middle line:90%
that the government controls.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.110 align:middle line:84%
So you can't use one of
these online services

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:29.990 align:middle line:84%
like many people do to find out
what their lineages comes from.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:31.440 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't pick up on that.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.020 align:middle line:84%
But all those services do
report to the governments.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think maybe
I understated this.

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.120 align:middle line:84%
You just can't go out
and get a DNA test

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.380 align:middle line:90%
and figure it was alien.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.590 align:middle line:90%
That can't happen.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:46.370 align:middle line:84%
There's specific
tests that are done

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.430 align:middle line:84%
by the government
in a particular way

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:53.240 align:middle line:84%
in specialized laboratories
that are protected by the United

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.260 align:middle line:90%
States government.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:26:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And only the DNA testing
on a particular person,

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:08.300 align:middle line:84%
where they're looking for a
possible alien strand or band,

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.162 align:middle line:84%
can be done by the
government laboratory.

00:26:10.162 --> 00:26:11.870 align:middle line:84%
It can't be done by
a civilian laboratory

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.340 align:middle line:84%
because there's
specific ways to do it.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.260 align:middle line:84%
But what they can find
out, as I understand,

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.530 align:middle line:84%
is it can determine,
OK, they tested you,

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.950 align:middle line:90%
and you have alien DNA.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:29.660 align:middle line:84%
The next question is, which
one, which specific species

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.290 align:middle line:90%
do you have?

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And as I understand,
they can distinguish

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.120 align:middle line:90%
which one is more prevalent.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know
the answer to that.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:43.310 align:middle line:84%
But I know that they can
determine which of the species

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.120 align:middle line:90%
that we know about.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.280 align:middle line:90%
Now there's seven.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Back when I was in government
service, only five.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.840 align:middle line:84%
But they could determine which
ones because we've done so many

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.830 align:middle line:90%
tests.

00:26:54.830 --> 00:27:04.100 align:middle line:84%
We have advanced this process
in studying DNA technology so

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:09.710 align:middle line:84%
much, specifically in the
area of finding the alien DNA,

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:13.880 align:middle line:84%
that now we can distinguish
which band of DNA

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:17.720 align:middle line:84%
you have that's alien,
whether it's from an Eben

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.610 align:middle line:90%
or an Archquloid or Apaloid or--

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>> A good point that you made to
me earlier that we talked about

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:28.130 align:middle line:84%
is actually, you have your
own frequency thumbprint.

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And we can just touch
a little bit on that

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.450 align:middle line:84%
because that's how
they're doing it now.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much to
even need the DNA,

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:40.120 align:middle line:84%
but that DNA holds its own
frequency, which you already

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:40.920 align:middle line:90%
know.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.087 align:middle line:84%
And if we're allowed to
talk about that if you want,

00:27:43.087 --> 00:27:47.960 align:middle line:84%
that our own frequency has been
put in a database to follow us

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:52.250 align:middle line:84%
or to heal us, many different
things they use that for.

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>> A fascinating area that
we're going to open right now is

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:58.130 align:middle line:90%
individual frequencies.

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.230 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
the government has tested,

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:02.400 align:middle line:84%
DARPA had a project
some years ago,

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.540 align:middle line:84%
and I was involved
in it, in studying

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.730 align:middle line:90%
frequencies, human frequencies.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And they determined
that every single human

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:12.980 align:middle line:90%
has a different frequency.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.080 align:middle line:84%
They generate a
different frequency.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.020 align:middle line:84%
What DARPA was more
interested in is how do we

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.630 align:middle line:90%
manipulate those frequencies?

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And most of DARPA's
initial research,

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.720 align:middle line:84%
once they found
out that everybody

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.330 align:middle line:84%
had a different
frequency, was determine

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:32.000 align:middle line:84%
how those frequencies
can be manipulated

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.610 align:middle line:90%
in the form of military.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Now if we're going to
attack an opposing army,

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Russian soldiers are out there.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.470 align:middle line:84%
We know they all have
different frequencies.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:45.360 align:middle line:90%
How do we jam those frequencies?

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
DARPA's project was.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.772 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
the final outcome

00:28:50.772 --> 00:28:54.390 align:middle line:84%
was because it was over
years and years of research.

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:57.350 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that they did find out,

00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:02.040 align:middle line:84%
DARPA did find out,
scientists, was your frequency

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.610 align:middle line:90%
can be manipulated.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:07.260 align:middle line:84%
If we do certain things
with your frequency,

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:08.880 align:middle line:90%
it can make you act differently.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:14.130 align:middle line:84%
It can make you sick or
it can make you heal.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:15.640 align:middle line:84%
A lot of different
things happen.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And I know you know
all about this.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And you know more,
medically speaking,

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:22.560 align:middle line:84%
about the manipulation of the
frequency, of what it does.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.750 align:middle line:84%
But I know DARPA
had that project.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:27.240 align:middle line:90%
And they experimented with it.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And how I know so much about
it is, I was a guinea pig.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.980 align:middle line:84%
I was one of the ones
that they determined.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.800 align:middle line:84%
I volunteered,
signed papers away.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And they were
manipulating my frequency.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:46.650 align:middle line:84%
They didn't ever harm me in any
way, but they made me think.

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Now one particular
case, I was sitting

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:53.400 align:middle line:84%
in a chair in a closed
encapsulated environment, where

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.790 align:middle line:84%
no other outside frequencies
or radio signals could get in.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And they were pinpointing,
they were sending a signal

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:01.320 align:middle line:90%
to my body.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.970 align:middle line:90%
And I had to be completely nude.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:04.920 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- I had no
clothes on or anything,

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.110 align:middle line:84%
which was a little
uncomfortable.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:11.265 align:middle line:84%
And when they did this,
they were jamming me

00:30:11.265 --> 00:30:12.390 align:middle line:90%
with different frequencies.

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:14.348 align:middle line:84%
They would ask me, well,
OK, what do you smell?

00:30:14.348 --> 00:30:15.460 align:middle line:90%
What do you taste?

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.100 align:middle line:90%
What are you thinking?

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.150 align:middle line:90%
And I was.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.410 align:middle line:90%
I was thinking.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:22.200 align:middle line:84%
They hit me with something,
I was thinking of pine trees.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:27.060 align:middle line:84%
They hit me something, I was
thinking of smelling roses.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Things like that, so
they could manipulate.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And then they did one
particular one that made me--

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:40.770 align:middle line:84%
visions came to my eyes of
these trees being blown around

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:45.710 align:middle line:84%
like I was in a forest
with heavy winds.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.080 align:middle line:84%
So that's something
that they did.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.460 align:middle line:90%
Never harmed me in any way.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.500 align:middle line:84%
I was always examined
before and after.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.820 align:middle line:90%
But that's one of the ways.

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, there were others
involved in this program,

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and they did a lot of
other different types.

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:00.150 align:middle line:90%
And also animals were involved.

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:02.600 align:middle line:84%
They determined that
animals had frequencies.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, I should say,
some of the more harming tests

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:15.710 align:middle line:84%
were done on animals to
determine how well they could

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:19.730 align:middle line:84%
accept higher frequencies
that might have disrupted

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:23.330 align:middle line:84%
their minds or things like that,
which they never did to humans.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you feel is
the big push with Congress

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and the Senate in getting
disclosure out right now?

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as we all
know, Congress,

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:35.030 align:middle line:84%
both the Republicans
and Democrats,

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:38.300 align:middle line:90%
agreed on a defense budget.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And in that defense budget was
a Whistleblower Protection Act

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.950 align:middle line:84%
and a Disclosure
Act and a procedure

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:50.270 align:middle line:84%
to collect information
on UFOs, UAPs.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's procedures
that are set in place.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:57.930 align:middle line:84%
First time in history
that this has happened.

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:04.850 align:middle line:84%
There's so many people, even
the most hardened, both sides,

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Republicans and Democrats both
in the House and the Senate,

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:12.180 align:middle line:90%
that want disclosure.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.410 align:middle line:90%
I hear it.

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:16.200 align:middle line:90%
I've spoken to senators.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.860 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken to
members of Congress.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:21.660 align:middle line:90%
And they want disclosure.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:28.530 align:middle line:84%
But they want it in a
logical and orderly way.

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they're working on.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that at some point
in the very near future,

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.120 align:middle line:90%
that disclosure will happen.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I hope so too, Rick.

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:42.930 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking forward to that.

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Rick, I want to thank you
for being on the show.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>> You're very welcome, Emery.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:48.140 align:middle line:90%
It was great being here.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:52.320 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.370 align:middle line:90%
