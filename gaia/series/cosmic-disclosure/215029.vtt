00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.680 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.160 align:middle line:10%
we are with Richard Doty,
a retired special agent who

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.840 align:middle line:10%
served in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.020 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.650 align:middle line:10%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are discussing
the Les Ramey story.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.100 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD C. DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.940 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So who is Les Ramey?

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.365 align:middle line:84%
And what's his background
before we get started?

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Les Ramey lived in
and around Rachel, Nevada way,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.070 align:middle line:90%
way, way back.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.090 align:middle line:10%
But the story actually
begins in a UFO convention

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:10%
when Robert Dean--

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.140 align:middle line:10%
Command Sergeant Major
Robert Dean, most people

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.330 align:middle line:10%
know that he was involved with
UFOs for most of his life.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.905 align:middle line:84%
He was in the
United States Army.

00:00:59.905 --> 00:01:01.780 align:middle line:84%
He was stationed in
Europe when he had access

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.599 align:middle line:84%
to some highly classified
documents pertaining

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.200 align:middle line:84%
to UFOs and United
States involvement

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.040 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.870 align:middle line:84%
So during one of the
conventions I was at,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Robert introduced me to Les
Ramey and Les told me his story.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And when he told
me a story, Robert

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.720 align:middle line:84%
was able to back it up with
some additional information.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And then I went out on my own
and found some more information.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.960 align:middle line:84%
But Les's story
is quite amazing.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.170 align:middle line:84%
He was born in around Alamo,
Nevada, grew up in Alamo,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:84%
went to school, in
and around that area,

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.880 align:middle line:84%
went in the United States Air
Force, served this country,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.050 align:middle line:90%
and got out of the Air Force.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And at that time period in the
late '60s, mining operations

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.780 align:middle line:84%
were going on in
and around Nevada.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.110 align:middle line:10%
And close to his home in
Alamo, the Lincoln mine,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.250 align:middle line:10%
which is now right across
from Rachel, Nevada,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:10%
was in operation, but it
was in caretaker status.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.070 align:middle line:10%
So he applied for a job.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.030 align:middle line:10%
And he was one of six members
of a caretaking status team that

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.950 align:middle line:10%
took care of the Lincoln mine.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:84%
He moved a trailer to what
is now Rachel, Nevada.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:84%
But back in those days,
it wasn't called Rachel.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.810 align:middle line:84%
It was called Sand
Springs, Tempe Valley.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.310 align:middle line:90%
And then eventually Rachel.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting part
of that, the name of Rachel

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.060 align:middle line:84%
is the first born child that
occurred in that valley area.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.090 align:middle line:84%
They named it Rachel, and then
they named the town Rachel.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.780 align:middle line:84%
But in 1972, there
wasn't any Rachel.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.550 align:middle line:84%
There was just a
few trailers out

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.005 align:middle line:84%
there in Western
Lincoln County, Nevada.

00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what
happened there in 1972?

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: On a summer
day, he took a walk.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Les took a walk towards what
was then the perimeter of Nellis

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.410 align:middle line:90%
Test Range.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And as he got closer, he
saw a light, bright light

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.130 align:middle line:90%
that was moving in towards him.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And then he saw
this thing landed.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.670 align:middle line:90%
It was a flying saucer.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.640 align:middle line:84%
He saw it as a flying
saucer, he relates.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And he thought,
well, that's probably

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.510 align:middle line:90%
something from the air base.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Although Groom Lake, Area
51, Tonopah Test Range

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.660 align:middle line:90%
wasn't known back in those days.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.460 align:middle line:90%
It existed.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.350 align:middle line:90%
It was there.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.990 align:middle line:84%
So he knew there was an
airbase there because he

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:90%
saw the planes flying.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And he had been in
the Air Force and he

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.090 align:middle line:84%
was stationed at Nellis
Air Force base beforehand,

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:90%
so he had some knowledge.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And when it landed,
he thought, well,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.210 align:middle line:84%
this has to be
something from the base.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.910 align:middle line:84%
But as he walked closer,
he saw these humanoids

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.860 align:middle line:90%
coming out of the spacecraft.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that
still, he says,

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.790 align:middle line:84%
gets him today, they
weren't walking.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.380 align:middle line:90%
They were hovering.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.720 align:middle line:84%
It was like they
were on strings.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And they came over to him and
they stood in front of him

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and he was somewhat
startled, but he felt at ease

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.130 align:middle line:84%
because he was hearing voices in
his head saying, "We're not here

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.930 align:middle line:90%
to harm you.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:90%
We're not here to harm you.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.370 align:middle line:90%
We're not here to harm you."

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.495 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: How did they look?

00:04:25.495 --> 00:04:27.455 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, he
described it as robots.

00:04:27.455 --> 00:04:28.355 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Robots?

00:04:28.355 --> 00:04:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yeah.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.665 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Hovering robots?

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:31.075 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They were
hovering robots.

00:04:31.075 --> 00:04:31.875 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: He said they
didn't look at all like--

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.520 align:middle line:84%
and again, this is
some years later,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.770 align:middle line:84%
so he said they doesn't look
like an extraterrestrial.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.690 align:middle line:90%
They were robots.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.350 align:middle line:90%
They were robotic.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.960 align:middle line:84%
They were in a suit
with a big helmet.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.772 align:middle line:84%
And so they didn't look
like little aliens.

00:04:48.772 --> 00:04:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Then they gestured for
him to come with them.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So he thought, he
didn't want to do that.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.190 align:middle line:84%
But something was pulling
him towards that spacecraft.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Like a field of energy?

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Yeah, he
felt it was something--

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't his emotions.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.953 align:middle line:84%
It was something that was
literally pulling him like--

00:05:07.953 --> 00:05:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So it's physically?

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.412 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: --a field of energy.

00:05:10.412 --> 00:05:12.160 align:middle line:90%
It was a physical movement.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.420 align:middle line:90%
So he got to the door.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.810 align:middle line:90%
He went inside.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.510 align:middle line:90%
He felt at ease at all time.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.140 align:middle line:90%
He didn't feel threatened.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And they directed him to a
location, a seat, a big sea.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.290 align:middle line:84%
They motioned for
him to sit down.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.590 align:middle line:84%
He was still hearing
voices in his head,

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.890 align:middle line:84%
but he wasn't connecting
those voices necessarily

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.100 align:middle line:90%
to the extraterrestrials.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a common thing that

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.160 align:middle line:84%
happens to humans
when they encounter

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.160 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials are using
telepathy or brain transfer.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:90%
They don't understand.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.130 align:middle line:90%
It's confusing at first.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, he sits
down in his chair.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.890 align:middle line:90%
A ball comes over him.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.500 align:middle line:84%
He's able to breathe
inside his ball.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And then he realizes,
oh, my gosh,

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.270 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
take me someplace.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:84%
So he tried actually to
get up, but he couldn't.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.980 align:middle line:90%
He was stuck in this ball.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And next thing you know,
he got extremely dizzy.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And when he woke up, he was
in a very barren landscape.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And he looked around and
he saw these mud huts.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.470 align:middle line:90%
And he was totally confused.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:90%
And then a small--

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.590 align:middle line:84%
he said, about 5
foot tall a figure

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.620 align:middle line:84%
came towards him with a
rather large head, large eyes.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.250 align:middle line:90%
Les was about 5' 8", 5' 9".

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And he's looking down, and
then suddenly this creature

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.030 align:middle line:84%
in front of him started
talking in English.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.560 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't very good English,
but he could understand.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And he immediately detected the
voice to be that of a female.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So he assumed that this entity
in front of him was a female.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.170 align:middle line:90%
And she told him, "Be calm.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:90%
We're not here to hurt you.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.710 align:middle line:90%
We want to educate you.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.610 align:middle line:84%
We want you to show
you where we live."

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle line:90%
And so he said, "OK."

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And so she started moving him
around to location, explaining,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.440 align:middle line:84%
this is where we live
in these mud huts.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.930 align:middle line:84%
This is a building over here
where we have our flying crafts.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.620 align:middle line:84%
She didn't call it a
spacecraft, flying crafts.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And so she showed him around,
so to speak, very polite.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And then at one point, he
said, "I need to get back.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.370 align:middle line:90%
I need to get back to Earth."

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:90%
He asked her where they were.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.380 align:middle line:90%
She wouldn't say.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, "I want
to get back to Earth."

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.970 align:middle line:90%
So she said, "Fine."

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.470 align:middle line:84%
She took him back
to the spacecraft.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.080 align:middle line:84%
He got back in,
sat in that seat.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.060 align:middle line:84%
The ball came
over, he got dizzy.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And when he woke up,
he walked outside

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.450 align:middle line:84%
and he was exactly back
in Rachel where he left.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Now, he wasn't
married at the time,

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.690 align:middle line:84%
but he had a girlfriend
in Alamo, Nevada.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.380 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't want
to tell her that.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So he went back to
his trailer and tried

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.730 align:middle line:84%
to decide what he was
going to do from there.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.355 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So we're
on what time period?

00:08:07.355 --> 00:08:08.155 align:middle line:90%
What year was this?

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:09.756 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: This was 1972.

00:08:09.756 --> 00:08:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So it started in 1972.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.985 align:middle line:90%
How long did it last?

00:08:12.985 --> 00:08:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: It lasted it
periodically for seven years.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And a few months later,
he went back there.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.110 align:middle line:90%
He had a calling.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Something was calling
him, and he went back

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:84%
to the exact same location,
the same spot on the ground,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.080 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And this craft
came in and landed.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.720 align:middle line:90%
He gets to board.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.280 align:middle line:90%
He goes to this planet.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.880 align:middle line:84%
He meets again with
this female being.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, the first thing he did
the second time is ask her,

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:44.740 align:middle line:90%
"What's your name."

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And she explained
that he wouldn't understand

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.180 align:middle line:84%
the names, so she'll call
herself Kim because he

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.830 align:middle line:90%
could understand that.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And when he asked, "OK, I
want to know where we're at.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.390 align:middle line:90%
What planet?

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Where are we?"

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And again, she came back
with the same explanation

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.120 align:middle line:90%
is you wouldn't understand it.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.600 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you something
that you won't understand.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.290 align:middle line:90%
So he left it at that.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:19.600 align:middle line:84%
The second time, he was taken
into a building, a big building.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.800 align:middle line:84%
It didn't seem to have any floor
to it as if he was floating.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.740 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't really
understand this.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.130 align:middle line:90%
But he looked around.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.040 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge building.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And these little creatures
were doing things, building

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.060 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.268 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Robots or creatures?

00:09:37.268 --> 00:09:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: No, these were
the entities exactly the same

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:47.510 align:middle line:84%
as Kim, which was the
large head, 5 foot tall.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Two arms,
two legs, bipedal.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Two arms, two legs.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And ironically, she
had five fingers.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And other than her head
or face, he identified her

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.580 align:middle line:90%
as being somewhat human.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:10.010 align:middle line:90%
And so she showed him around.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.240 align:middle line:90%
And so he was thrilled by it.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And so he was there for
a certain period of time.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.520 align:middle line:90%
They sent him back.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, the second time,
he realized that there

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.420 align:middle line:90%
was a lot of time missing.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.040 align:middle line:84%
The first time he
never timed himself.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.740 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know how
much time, but he

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:84%
knew that it couldn't have
been too long because he

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.640 align:middle line:84%
was able to get
back and go to work.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.355 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't like it was
years or anything like that.

00:10:37.355 --> 00:10:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Days, right.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.272 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: But when he
came back the second time,

00:10:40.272 --> 00:10:42.280 align:middle line:84%
he looked at his
watch and realized

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.040 align:middle line:84%
that he'd been gone
for about eight hours.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Now, he
couldn't understand it.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And he's somewhat
educated, but he

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.400 align:middle line:84%
couldn't understand
how he could possibly

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.160 align:middle line:84%
go to another planet
in that time period.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.710 align:middle line:84%
So after the second time,
he goes back and again,

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:02.410 align:middle line:84%
he's not certain who he
could talk to about this.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And so he goes to
work and another one

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.700 align:middle line:84%
of his fellow
workers, caretakers--

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And there were
caretaking for this mine.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said it wasn't
very hard work.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.320 align:middle line:84%
They just had to
maintain the mine.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.880 align:middle line:10%
But this other person
that he worked with

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.930 align:middle line:10%
said, where do you go
for your walk every day?

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:31.100 align:middle line:90%
He lived not too far from Les.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And Les says,
"What do you mean?"

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I see
you go for a walk,

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and then you must walk for a
long ways because you come back

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.760 align:middle line:90%
hours later."

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And now Les was worried about
that, like is he not telling me

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.780 align:middle line:84%
that he sees me getting
in a spacecraft or--

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:49.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: So he
leaves it at that.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.990 align:middle line:90%
But that was a concern of Les.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So the third time that
Les goes down there--

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.240 align:middle line:90%
he's the calling again.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.410 align:middle line:90%
He goes down.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.010 align:middle line:90%
And this is a winter time.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:03.530 align:middle line:90%
He said, this is winter.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:84%
There was snow on the
ground, it was cold outside.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really want
to go, because he

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.600 align:middle line:90%
had to walk maybe half a mile.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, he didn't want
to go, but he went.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.340 align:middle line:90%
It's cold.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.900 align:middle line:84%
He gets there, craft
comes down, he gets in it,

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:90%
they take him to the planet.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.822 align:middle line:84%
And when he gets out, he
notices that this planet

00:12:24.822 --> 00:12:26.910 align:middle line:90%
is extremely hot.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:middle line:84%
But he never realized that the
other two times he was there.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: So he
couldn't figure that out.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.010 align:middle line:84%
But this time, they took
him into another room

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and they put him in this seat
with other extraterrestrials

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.170 align:middle line:84%
all looking like Kim but
men, because their voices

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.800 align:middle line:90%
were that of men's voices.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:84%
They were speaking English and
they were asking him questions.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And the questions
they were asking him

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.025 align:middle line:84%
were what he did
in the Air Force.

00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So it's very specific.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.850 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like, what
do you do in your life?

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.570 align:middle line:84%
It was, what did you
do in the Air Force?

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.865 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: What you do in
the United States Air Force.

00:13:04.865 --> 00:13:09.540 align:middle line:84%
He was shocked they knew
United States, the Air Force.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, Les was a
nuclear technician

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.990 align:middle line:90%
in the United States Air Force.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.670 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't want
them to know it.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And he thought-- this
was some years later.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he'd been out of
Air Force for seven or eight

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.630 align:middle line:84%
years or nine years probably,
and so he didn't want to--

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.880 align:middle line:90%
he knew that all was classified.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.940 align:middle line:84%
But they were able to
convince him to tell them

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.650 align:middle line:90%
everything he knew, and he did.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've heard other
stories that I've talked about

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.660 align:middle line:84%
and we've heard a number
of different people

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:84%
talk about how interested
extraterrestrials

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.060 align:middle line:90%
were in nuclear weapons.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Why are they asking
these questions?

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Why are they concerned
with nuclear weapons?

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:90%
And he asks them that.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:58.190 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Why are you
concerned with nuclear weapons?

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.950 align:middle line:90%
You don't have nuclear weapons?"

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:90%
No, we don't have them.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what they
are, but we want to know.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.690 align:middle line:90%
We see you use them.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Of course, remember,
right there,

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.150 align:middle line:84%
they had Nevada test site where
they exploded nuclear weapons

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.300 align:middle line:84%
almost every day underground
back in those days.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.920 align:middle line:84%
But before that, before 1963,
it was above-ground testing.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.890 align:middle line:84%
So they see this,
and now they want

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.340 align:middle line:90%
to know what these things are.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is what really, really,
really concerned him was,

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.110 align:middle line:90%
what are you going to do?

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.860 align:middle line:84%
What are you going to
do with these things

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.380 align:middle line:90%
if I talk to you about them.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Now, he was just a technician.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.760 align:middle line:90%
He didn't build them.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.597 align:middle line:90%
He maintained them.

00:14:38.597 --> 00:14:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What's he going to say?

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:41.347 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: What's
he going to say?

00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:43.350 align:middle line:84%
But he told them
everything that he knew.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.970 align:middle line:90%
So now what?

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.120 align:middle line:84%
He thinks he
betrayed his country.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.590 align:middle line:90%
So they send him back.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:54.280 align:middle line:84%
But before he got off the
spacecraft, this time,

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.810 align:middle line:90%
Kim accompanied him.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Before, it was just these robots
that couldn't speak English

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:84%
or didn't speak, that
were flying in this craft.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.340 align:middle line:84%
But this time, Kim
came back with him.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And Kim gave him
an object, a tube.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:11.100 align:middle line:90%
And he said--

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A tube?

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: A tube.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.225 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: A circular--
almost like a wand.

00:15:14.225 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A wand.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:15.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And said,
"This is my gift to you.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:22.850 align:middle line:84%
When you want to talk to me, you
talk in this and I'll talk back

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:23.650 align:middle line:90%
to you."

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And he thought it was odd
because he thought, well,

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.457 align:middle line:84%
there must be hundreds of
thousands of miles away.

00:15:30.457 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:90%
How can we talk like this?

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.600 align:middle line:84%
But he took it and he took
it back to his trailer.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.150 align:middle line:90%
He puts it down in his trailer.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And he hid it in
the refrigerator.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And when I ask
him about that, he

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.280 align:middle line:84%
had another entirely
different story.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So he continues to make
contact until 1979.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.970 align:middle line:84%
He left the mine, the
caretaker in the mine.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:57.260 align:middle line:84%
They closed the mine and now
he works for Lincoln County,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.600 align:middle line:90%
the road department.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And one day he was driving
down old Corn Creek Road.

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And anybody that's ever
studied or ever researched

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.700 align:middle line:84%
around the entrances
to Area 51, you're

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:84%
going to know where
old Corn Creek Road is.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:19.180 align:middle line:84%
It's on the far Eastern
perimeter of the Nellis Test

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.260 align:middle line:90%
and Training Range.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.330 align:middle line:84%
There's two entrances
that are closed

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.780 align:middle line:90%
that you could go in there.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:27.310 align:middle line:84%
But he's driving
down this road and he

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:31.780 align:middle line:84%
drives close to the perimeter
and he sees a craft.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.550 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't call for it.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:34.730 align:middle line:90%
He didn't do anything.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.150 align:middle line:84%
So he gets out and
walks up to it.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:38.980 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't Kim.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.760 align:middle line:90%
It was this other entity.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.800 align:middle line:84%
The other entity was about
the same size, looked exactly

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.450 align:middle line:90%
like Kim, but it wasn't Kim.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:51.990 align:middle line:84%
He thought it was Kim,
identified himself to Kim.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.017 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't Kim.

00:16:53.017 --> 00:16:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Who was it?

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: It was
another extraterrestrial.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And this extraterrestrial
says, "We

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:04.200 align:middle line:84%
want you to come back
to our planet and live.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.480 align:middle line:90%
We want you to help us."

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is '79, seven years
after this first contact.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:13.200 align:middle line:90%
He has a job.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.020 align:middle line:84%
This time, he's not
married, but he's

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.089 align:middle line:90%
engaged to this girl at Alamo.

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:21.359 align:middle line:84%
And they were
planning a marriage.

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:23.849 align:middle line:84%
And I believe he said this
particular incident happened

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:27.210 align:middle line:90%
in early April or the spring.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "No, I'm
not going to do that.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm not leaving."

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And they said, "Yes, you
have to come with us."

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, he
got into his truck

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:39.135 align:middle line:84%
and he drove away, fearing that
they're going to come after him.

00:17:39.135 --> 00:17:40.997 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:17:40.997 --> 00:17:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: So
eventually, he gets back

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.840 align:middle line:84%
to his home, which
is still in Rachel.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.460 align:middle line:90%
And now it's called Rachel.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.900 align:middle line:90%
He's scared to death.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.580 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know what to do.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.530 align:middle line:84%
So he thinks he needs now
to report it to authorities.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Who does he report it to?

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:55.390 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:18:00.880 align:middle line:84%
So one morning he
wakes up to go to work.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And just as he goes
to the front door,

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.060 align:middle line:90%
there's a knock on the door.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And he opens the door
and these two men

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.620 align:middle line:84%
are outside who identify
themselves as federal agents.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.320 align:middle line:84%
One's an OSI agent,
one's an FBI agent.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.100 align:middle line:84%
They come in and
they said, we need

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.700 align:middle line:90%
to talk to you about something.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.892 align:middle line:90%
And he knows now.

00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: He knows right away.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: The OSI agent
said, "Les, somebody gave you

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.040 align:middle line:90%
something some time ago.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And we need that
because if you keep it,

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:40.770 align:middle line:84%
it's dangerous to you
and you're going to die."

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Now Les says, God, I'm
scared to death now.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I don't go get
it and give it to them,

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:51.175 align:middle line:84%
they can search it and
search my property anyway.

00:18:51.175 --> 00:18:51.975 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:18:51.975 --> 00:18:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: So he tried the
avoidance plan on his part.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.330 align:middle line:84%
He kept saying, I don't know
what you're talking about,

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.370 align:middle line:90%
who you're talking about."

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And the OSI agent
says, "We have somebody

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.360 align:middle line:90%
that knows who you know.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And we know that person
saw another person give you

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:18.010 align:middle line:90%
the object."

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Uh-oh.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: So now he's scared.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.248 align:middle line:84%
He thinks that there's people
out there with cameras.

00:19:23.248 --> 00:19:24.540 align:middle line:90%
He thought all sorts of things.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So he went to the
refrigerator, he gets it out

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.750 align:middle line:84%
of the refrigerator and he
gives it to the two agents.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And then they start
interrogating him, asking

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.510 align:middle line:90%
him exactly what this person--

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.900 align:middle line:90%
and they called him a person.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:43.610 align:middle line:84%
They didn't say to Les it was
an extraterrestrial or anything

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:44.770 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:47.830 align:middle line:90%
And Les was telling them.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, Les says,
"These weren't humans."

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And the OSI agent says, "What
makes you think they're not

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:56.180 align:middle line:90%
humans."

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Because they put me
in a spacecraft and he flew me

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.400 align:middle line:90%
to another planet."

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.010 align:middle line:90%
He says, "You think so?"

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And Les says, "If they weren't
aliens, what are you doing here?

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.310 align:middle line:90%
Why did you take that from me."

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.070 align:middle line:84%
He said, "We have
friends that work

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.350 align:middle line:84%
with them and we
can't let something

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.780 align:middle line:90%
like this get out of the hands.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:25.490 align:middle line:84%
If this came into the public,
there's going to be problems."

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:29.300 align:middle line:90%
So Les says, "OK."

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And they left and Les
expected to be arrested,

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:35.060 align:middle line:90%
but he never was.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:39.356 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did Ramey learn
from these extraterrestrials?

00:20:39.356 --> 00:20:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, Kim, every
time he had contact with Kim,

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.863 align:middle line:84%
she would portray
information to him,

00:20:46.863 --> 00:20:49.030 align:middle line:84%
but he didn't understand
what she was talking about.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.195 align:middle line:90%
It was over his head.

00:20:50.195 --> 00:20:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: She gave him a design
on a very flimsy piece of paper.

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And he had no idea
what this design was.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So when he took it back to
his trailer and he put it down

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.432 align:middle line:84%
and he'd look at
it and he moved it,

00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:08.140 align:middle line:84%
turned it in all sorts
of different ways,

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.870 align:middle line:84%
and he couldn't figure
out what it was.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So he put it away
like it was a gift

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.100 align:middle line:90%
that he couldn't understand.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And when he went
back another time,

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.100 align:middle line:90%
she gave him something else.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Well,
first of all,

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.090 align:middle line:84%
you gave me something
the last time.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was a design
of something.

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:24.760 align:middle line:90%
What was it?"

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.700 align:middle line:90%
And she said, "That's you.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.890 align:middle line:90%
What I showed you was you."

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.370 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't understand that.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.300 align:middle line:90%
He had no idea what that was.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.297 align:middle line:90%
And, me?

00:21:35.297 --> 00:21:36.130 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean me?

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:37.270 align:middle line:90%
That's you.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, she couldn't relate
to him what DNA was.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:44.720 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't know what DNA was.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And back in those days,
very, very few people

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:48.360 align:middle line:90%
knew what DNA was.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:54.310 align:middle line:84%
So she gave him an actual
picture of a strand of DNA.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:55.900 align:middle line:90%
That was him.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, years later, he's
going to figure that out.

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And then she gives
him other things

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.320 align:middle line:84%
that he didn't understand
but he kept them.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And then he
never saw her again,

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.560 align:middle line:90%
but he kept looking at this.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And he was reading an article in
a newspaper in about 2001 or 2.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.100 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't remember exactly.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.900 align:middle line:90%
He said it was after 9/11.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And he saw a strand of
DNA in this magazine.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.290 align:middle line:90%
And he went and got out--

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:29.095 align:middle line:90%
in a safe.

00:22:29.095 --> 00:22:29.970 align:middle line:90%
He kept it in a safe.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: The picture.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: This picture.

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And it matched exactly what
a DNA strand looked like.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:41.790 align:middle line:84%
So she was telling him what she
couldn't explain fully to him

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:43.050 align:middle line:90%
that maybe--

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:46.570 align:middle line:84%
and he thinks now or then
when I met with him--

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.530 align:middle line:84%
that she was telling
him that we created you

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and this is what you
are, this DNA strand.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And some of these other
things that he had,

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.680 align:middle line:84%
now he realized, my god, she
gave me this stuff years ago.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.350 align:middle line:90%
And now he started researching.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.400 align:middle line:84%
He had-- went to
college after this all,

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.430 align:middle line:84%
so he's somewhat educated in
like viruses and bacteria.

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And some of these things look
like viruses or bacteria.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And later he had given it to a
doctor who later confirmed that.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:24.150 align:middle line:84%
So she was giving him
knowledge that she already

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:28.750 align:middle line:84%
knew about him and
about this planet.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And what does that make him feel
like that they have been here

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:34.700 align:middle line:84%
before and maybe
they created us.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how did these
ongoing visits, these contacts

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:42.150 align:middle line:84%
with Kim, moving
forward, how did it

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:47.675 align:middle line:84%
affect Ramey's life and his
professional life as well?

00:23:47.675 --> 00:23:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: First of
all, he eventually,

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.650 align:middle line:84%
after that last contact
on old Corn Creek Road,

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:57.280 align:middle line:84%
where he virtually ran
away from this craft,

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.850 align:middle line:84%
he figured he had
to tell his fiancée.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:02.190 align:middle line:84%
They were getting
married in a few months

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:04.110 align:middle line:90%
and so he had to tell her.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:06.612 align:middle line:84%
So he sat one night
in their trailer--

00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:08.070 align:middle line:84%
and he still lived
in that trailer.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.653 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And this is the first
time ever telling her anything.

00:24:10.653 --> 00:24:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: First time ever
revealing anything to her

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.430 align:middle line:84%
after seven years of contact
with an extraterrestrial.

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:20.860 align:middle line:84%
He sat her down and
told her his story.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.090 align:middle line:84%
He said virtually the same
story I'm telling you now.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: She looked at him
and she got up, packed her bags,

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:28.870 align:middle line:90%
and left.

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And he tried to stop
her and she said,

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:35.440 align:middle line:84%
you're crazy, I don't want
anything to do with you,

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.650 align:middle line:90%
and left.

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:43.055 align:middle line:84%
Now, the incident with his
fiancée demoralized him.

00:24:43.055 --> 00:24:45.340 align:middle line:90%
And so now what does he do?

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:49.860 align:middle line:84%
He can't tell anybody this
story anymore because this

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:90%
is what's going to happen.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So he started going in the late
'90s to some UFO conventions

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:02.880 align:middle line:84%
trying to see maybe he could see
people or talk to people that

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.920 align:middle line:84%
had the same
experience as he did.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.630 align:middle line:90%
And lo and behold, he did.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:11.070 align:middle line:84%
He talked to a lady who was
somewhat older than him,

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.600 align:middle line:90%
but had similar experiences.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.720 align:middle line:90%
And she was an experiencer.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And they got together
and eventually, they

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:22.440 align:middle line:90%
got married some years later.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
Les passed away.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:31.270 align:middle line:84%
But when he talked to me
with Robert Dean present,

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:36.480 align:middle line:84%
he told me that he never felt
comfortable around people

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.630 align:middle line:84%
because he had knowledge
that they didn't have.

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And he always wanted to
jump out and say things,

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.810 align:middle line:84%
but he thought that they're
not going to believe me.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:49.810 align:middle line:84%
They're going to tell me you're
nuts like my ex fiancée did.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And so that had
affected his life.

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:53.750 align:middle line:90%
It really did affect his life.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And he always thought
because of the knowledge

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:58.510 align:middle line:84%
that he had of nuclear
weapons that they

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:00.130 align:middle line:90%
were going to come back.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.385 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately for him,
they never came back.

00:26:02.385 --> 00:26:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did the Air Force
Office of Special Investigations

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.265 align:middle line:84%
comment on Ramey's claims
throughout this whole thing.

00:26:09.265 --> 00:26:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well,
sometime later, he

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.640 align:middle line:84%
went to OSI at Nellis Air Force
base and wanted to talk to them.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: This was years after.

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: This is
some years later.

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And wanted the device that
was taken from him back.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And when he spoke to OSI, the
initial agents he spoke with him

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:30.130 align:middle line:84%
and had no idea who
he was or anything.

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Of course not.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:30.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: But eventually,
they got his name and said,

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.310 align:middle line:84%
we'll get back in
touch with you.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.340 align:middle line:10%
Some weeks later, they
call him up and said,

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.090 align:middle line:10%
you come in and talk
to one of the agents.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:41.330 align:middle line:84%
It was a female agent who I
actually knew at one time.

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And so he came into the office
and he tells her this story.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.300 align:middle line:90%
He says, "Can I have that back?"

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And she says, "Do you actually
think we can give that back

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:52.890 align:middle line:90%
to you."

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.245 align:middle line:90%
She said, "That's not from here.

00:26:55.245 --> 00:26:57.450 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And if we gave that
back to you, they're

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.280 align:middle line:90%
going to know how to find you.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.400 align:middle line:90%
And you don't want that."

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So she said, "I suggest you just
get up, forget this happened,

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.490 align:middle line:90%
and get out of this office."

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And he said that's almost
verbatim what she said to him.

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And he decided he'd
follow her orders.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't think
about the fact

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:23.550 align:middle line:84%
that maybe this thing was
not only could he call them,

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:25.740 align:middle line:90%
they could hone in on him.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:31.455 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's why they
haven't contacted him since.

00:27:31.455 --> 00:27:33.245 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Once they
took that device away,

00:27:33.245 --> 00:27:35.120 align:middle line:10%
is that when his contacted
experiences ended?

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Yes he never
had any more contact.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:38.820 align:middle line:90%
He had dreams.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.980 align:middle line:84%
He had some visions
that right afterwards.

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:45.090 align:middle line:84%
But he thought that would
be just a natural reaction

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:46.810 align:middle line:90%
to what he had gone through.

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:50.415 align:middle line:84%
But never again did he
have any contact with them.

00:27:50.415 --> 00:27:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So what was his legacy?

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Was there anything left that was
great for the field of ufology?

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Privately
speaking, I guess

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.395 align:middle line:84%
it was, at least for OSI and for
the US government intelligence.

00:28:03.395 --> 00:28:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It was definitely
documented, right.

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: It was documented.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And the intelligence
community got an alien device.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So even though he wasn't
credited directly,

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.760 align:middle line:84%
I would say that he was credited
with obtaining something

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.090 align:middle line:84%
from an extraterrestrial race
and providing the United States

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.000 align:middle line:90%
government with it.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you aware of that
technology later on, Rick,

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.890 align:middle line:84%
going anywhere else or
being reverse engineered?

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: There are a lot
of rumors to that effect.

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There's
been similar types

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:37.626 align:middle line:90%
of-- these types of devices.

00:28:37.626 --> 00:28:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: There's
people out there

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:41.690 align:middle line:84%
like Chris Mellon
and some others who

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:47.280 align:middle line:84%
talk about devices that we
have obtained from somewhere.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
talking about what Les got

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and what Les had to turn
over to our government.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:29:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure at least we're
trying to reverse engineer it.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Whether we actually have
or not, I don't know.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And you're
not aware of actually

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:10.730 align:middle line:84%
AFOSI utilizing that device
to make contact and find out

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:12.100 align:middle line:90%
who Kim is?

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: I wish I
had that information.

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.560 align:middle line:84%
But no, I don't have
that information.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, once again,
Rick, very fascinating story.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:21.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for sharing.
