00:00:19.303 --> 00:00:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.970 align:middle line:10%
You're watching
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.930 align:middle line:10%
My name is Jay Weidner.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.085 align:middle line:10%
And we are back with Jason Rice.

00:00:25.085 --> 00:00:25.960 align:middle line:10%
How you doing, Jason?

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.710 align:middle line:10%
>>JASON RICE: I'm
doing great, Jay.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.370 align:middle line:10%
Thank you again for having me.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So a lot of
people in these programs

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.170 align:middle line:90%
claim to have empathic ability.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.560 align:middle line:90%
And you're one of them.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Why would they be concerned with
you having empathic abilities?

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, the process of
acknowledging or utilizing

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.710 align:middle line:90%
the empathic abilities--

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.310 align:middle line:84%
at a genetic trait
level, those are skills

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.370 align:middle line:90%
that I believe everybody has.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And going back to the analogy
of a large switchboard,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:84%
every one of us has a number of
switches that are either turned

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:90%
on or off when we are born.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And the empathic abilities is
another one of those switches.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Included amongst them
would be the ability

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:84%
to play an instrument
or the ability

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.530 align:middle line:84%
to learn and use
various languages.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And so having the skill set of
empathic or intuitive empath

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.550 align:middle line:84%
abilities are something
that I believe

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.620 align:middle line:84%
everybody could potentially
take advantage of or use.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:84%
It's whether or not we
turn them on or off.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Their interest in the
intuitive empath abilities

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.170 align:middle line:84%
are because it rounds out
not just the intelligence,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.200 align:middle line:90%
but the physical abilities.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.030 align:middle line:84%
It adds to the person's
overall use picture

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.770 align:middle line:84%
for the different
types of missions

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.740 align:middle line:90%
that they could be utilized on.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Like what?

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.665 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Give me an example.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: A good example of
that would be going into, say,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.240 align:middle line:84%
a negotiation with either
a neighbor or another group

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.590 align:middle line:84%
or organization and being able
to feel and sense and pick up

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.670 align:middle line:84%
different meanings behind things
that are said or things that

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:90%
aren't said--

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.820 align:middle line:84%
body language, being able to
finish someone's sentence,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:84%
whether it's done
mentally or verbally,

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.240 align:middle line:84%
and knowing the direction
in which a person is

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.380 align:middle line:84%
going either for negotiations
or for their demands

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.610 align:middle line:90%
or their needs.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So essentially
you're saying that you

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.510 align:middle line:90%
have psychic abilities?

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I wouldn't characterize
it as psychic abilities

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.110 align:middle line:84%
because those, I think,
are generally referring

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.230 align:middle line:90%
to other types of skill sets.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.000 align:middle line:84%
But the ability of an IE,
an Intuitive Empath, to--

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.830 align:middle line:90%
think of it like this.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.360 align:middle line:84%
If you're working on something
that you are extremely focused

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.050 align:middle line:84%
on, people refer commonly
to being in the zone.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in the
zone, whether it's writing

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:84%
or it's carpentry
or artwork, that's

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.810 align:middle line:84%
typically when you hear a
lot of that being referenced.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm in the zone.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm really focused and
keyed into the things

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.270 align:middle line:90%
that I'm working on.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.820 align:middle line:84%
So being able to quickly
get into the zone

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.750 align:middle line:84%
of the topic at hand
or the task at hand

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.200 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is
that you're working on

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.790 align:middle line:84%
allows for the individual
to consider and pick up

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.470 align:middle line:84%
not just their own logic
tree thinking, but the logic

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and thinking and the processes
that others are going through.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
For instance, you're working
together with a group of people

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.100 align:middle line:84%
to put a tent together,
something simple.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And being able to
identify without asking

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:84%
or without communicating
that person number three

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.640 align:middle line:84%
has a really hard time
putting poles together.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And so being able to
identify that at first glance

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.589 align:middle line:84%
so that you can then say,
OK, well, if person three has

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:23.480 align:middle line:84%
a hard time with
poles, person two

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.110 align:middle line:84%
does not have any issues
with the coordination

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.560 align:middle line:90%
needed to do that.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And so being able to
work together as a team,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.860 align:middle line:84%
lead a team better,
being able to do

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.390 align:middle line:84%
a little predictive thinking
on where the strengths are,

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.030 align:middle line:84%
where an individual's
weaknesses are.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did other people
that you served with have

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.030 align:middle line:90%
the same empathic abilities?

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They did.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.233 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So everybody had
kind of the same abilities?

00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Same baseline.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: They tested you for this?

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The way that
it was explained to us

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:00.400 align:middle line:84%
was that the whole reason why we
were asked to join to volunteer

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.070 align:middle line:84%
was because of that
baseline skill level.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:90%
And there were varying degrees.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How did they find
out that you had this?

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Through the testing.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.693 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: What testing?

00:05:09.693 --> 00:05:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The testing
that they had

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.680 align:middle line:84%
conducted while I was in
that behavioral modification

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.850 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And it involves a
certain amount of being

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.230 align:middle line:84%
able to feel color, for
instance, without seeing it,

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.900 align:middle line:84%
being able to determine
where something

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.160 align:middle line:90%
was hidden without hesitation.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.605 align:middle line:84%
Those were some of
the tests that they

00:05:33.605 --> 00:05:36.620 align:middle line:84%
had used to determine
who had varying

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.780 align:middle line:84%
degrees of intuitive
empathic abilities.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What's the difference
between intuitive empath

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.250 align:middle line:90%
and remote viewing?

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Remote
viewing is the process

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:53.590 align:middle line:84%
of tuning into energies
that are outside

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.980 align:middle line:90%
of the immediate surroundings.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a different type of
focus, a different type

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.260 align:middle line:84%
of concentration, and a
different type of training

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.870 align:middle line:90%
to be able to remote view.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So were you born
with these abilities?

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Did you realize that you could
turn a switch on at some point

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.570 align:middle line:90%
and turn it on?

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:17.780 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.390 align:middle line:90%
How did you get to this point?

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Me personally,
I was born with them.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You had these abilities
from your entire life.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And that must have
affected you in some way--

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.760 align:middle line:84%
your life as a kid
and all that, right?

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It did.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:90%
It did.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.820 align:middle line:84%
It affected interactions
especially with other people,

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.610 align:middle line:90%
grown ups, kids, peers.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did the
military implant you

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.900 align:middle line:84%
with anything to
enhance these abilities?

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The nanite
enhancement therapies

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.030 align:middle line:84%
assisted in enhancing
those abilities because

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.840 align:middle line:84%
of the nutrient feeds
that they would provide

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:84%
to certain glands or certain
areas of the body that

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:84%
are specifically utilized by
these types of abilities--

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.360 align:middle line:90%
for instance, the pineal gland.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And providing
additional nutrients

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.050 align:middle line:84%
or the right types of
hormones or chemicals

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.380 align:middle line:90%
can help enhance it.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.410 align:middle line:84%
So yes, the nanite
enhancement therapies

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:28.300 align:middle line:84%
did improve these abilities,
the natural abilities.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And then there's
areas of the brain--

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.720 align:middle line:90%
the frontal cortex, I believe.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So that's the empathic
part of the brain.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.030 align:middle line:90%
Anything there?

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.470 align:middle line:90%
Did they enhance that part?

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.262 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The way that
it was explained to me

00:07:40.262 --> 00:07:45.010 align:middle line:84%
was it was an improvement
on the efficiency of signals

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:84%
from the brain to the body
or to the different organs

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.010 align:middle line:90%
and different systems.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So kind of
an electrical--

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, an
improved inductance

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.410 align:middle line:90%
of the electrical signals.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I like that.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Not a wholesale
creation of additional memories

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.610 align:middle line:84%
or additional
thoughts, but again,

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.670 align:middle line:84%
along the lines of improving
what's already there.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So did you
use these skills

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:16.360 align:middle line:84%
when you were communicating
with ETs and other races?

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I did.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.830 align:middle line:84%
The training that they put
us through for enhancing

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:25.720 align:middle line:84%
our natural psy abilities, or
the ones that we were born with

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.530 align:middle line:84%
or had turned on,
including identification

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:35.140 align:middle line:84%
of what skills and talents
that we had, and among them

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.190 align:middle line:90%
included--

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:84%
generically, every soldier--
was the mental communication

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:47.170 align:middle line:84%
ability, the mind-to-mind
communication.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Not only did we have the
nanite enhancements that

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:54.520 align:middle line:84%
allowed for mind-to-mind
radio communications,

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.060 align:middle line:84%
for the lack of a better
way of putting it, but being

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:84%
able to communicate, for
instance, with the insectoids.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And being able to put
together defenses against

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:10.540 align:middle line:84%
attack from those that have
a higher psychic ability.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And the different steps that
we took to defend ourselves

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:90%
against such attacks.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.520 align:middle line:84%
I was able to utilize
those during my encounter

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.940 align:middle line:84%
with the insectoids when
I had been taken prisoner

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.750 align:middle line:84%
in which they were trying
to question me mentally

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and trying to get and
extract information.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And had I not had those
defensive parameters

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:40.750 align:middle line:84%
or those defensive
protocols, I don't

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:45.280 align:middle line:84%
think that I would have been
able to stand up to the attacks

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.255 align:middle line:90%
that I was going under.

00:09:46.255 --> 00:09:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So what's the
difference between being

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.890 align:middle line:84%
an intuitive empath
and telepathy?

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Someone who is
telepathic has the ability

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.880 align:middle line:84%
to both send and receive
messages mentally.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And the use of
technology allowed

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.660 align:middle line:84%
us to send messages
back and forth

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.210 align:middle line:84%
between soldiers that
had the same technology

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.180 align:middle line:90%
in their bodies.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.852 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: But that was
a natural ability.

00:10:10.852 --> 00:10:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That was an enhanced,
non-natural ability.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are those that
have that switch turned on

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and can do that without
the need of any technology.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
that is ultimately

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:84%
what's possible without the
need for any technology at all,

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:34.060 align:middle line:84%
the difference being that
someone that's telepathic

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:39.460 align:middle line:84%
can communicate naturally
back and forth without words

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.032 align:middle line:90%
from direct mind to mind.

00:10:41.032 --> 00:10:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So what
you're talking about

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.915 align:middle line:90%
is really more like feelings.

00:10:44.915 --> 00:10:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The best way
that I can explain

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:54.730 align:middle line:84%
it is a combination of
feelings, images, words

00:10:54.730 --> 00:11:04.460 align:middle line:84%
even that are of
origin outside myself.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And being able to distinguish
what is originating outside

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:84%
and what originates within
the self is a challenge.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:17.440 align:middle line:90%
And it requires training.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And it requires
being able to silence

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.010 align:middle line:84%
the parts of the
mind that are always

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:26.150 align:middle line:84%
wanting to fire and keep
on the mental and internal

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.040 align:middle line:90%
conversations.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Any alien groups ever
use this ability against you?

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They did.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: How did that happen?

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The insectoids, during
the interrogation process,

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:44.270 align:middle line:84%
were questioning what my motives
were or where I was from.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.670 align:middle line:84%
They didn't believe that we
were there to try and work

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.200 align:middle line:90%
together and help them.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.480 align:middle line:84%
They thought that
I was a part of one

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.140 align:middle line:84%
of the opposing criminal
gangs and that I was there

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.870 align:middle line:84%
to try and smoke them out
and get them to reveal

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:59.720 align:middle line:90%
some of their secrets.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:05.800 align:middle line:84%
The attacks that
they used were--

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:10.030 align:middle line:84%
the closest analog
would be mental screams,

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.920 align:middle line:84%
screaming within
the brain, being

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.640 align:middle line:84%
able to try and stun me to lower
the defenses that I had set up.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: All right.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.482 align:middle line:90%
Let me get this straight.

00:12:18.482 --> 00:12:21.273 align:middle line:84%
So the insectoids have some
kind of psychic ability?

00:12:21.273 --> 00:12:22.315 align:middle line:90%
Or is this technological?

00:12:22.315 --> 00:12:23.115 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They do.

00:12:23.115 --> 00:12:25.300 align:middle line:84%
They had a natural
psychic ability.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: To telepathically
get into your head?

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.783 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: To communicate.

00:12:29.783 --> 00:12:30.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: To communicate.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They weren't
able to read my mind.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And they required my input and
my communication with them.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:42.680 align:middle line:84%
But they did not use words to
communicate amongst themselves.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.020 align:middle line:84%
They all communicated
telepathically.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:45.820 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they didn't have a
language, a voice language?

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.040 align:middle line:84%
If they did, I had
never heard it.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.530 align:middle line:84%
They all communicated
telepathically.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you were
being held prisoner

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.310 align:middle line:84%
and they were putting
thoughts into your head

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.372 align:middle line:90%
or trying to talk to you?

00:12:59.372 --> 00:13:00.955 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Trying to
communicate with me.

00:13:00.955 --> 00:13:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And was it a
negative experience?

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.300 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: It was.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.310 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
negative experience.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:10.090 align:middle line:90%
It was an assault and an attack.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:16.660 align:middle line:84%
It was akin to being
blasted with the most

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:21.930 align:middle line:84%
offensive and loud music that
doesn't vibrate with you.

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And so it's hard to describe
what it felt like other than it

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:32.140 align:middle line:90%
was an invasion and an assault.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And there must
have been a point to this.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were trying to
get information out of me.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: But they couldn't
see your thoughts.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: They could only put
thoughts into your head.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They could
only communicate.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So unless you
actually formed a thought,

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.530 align:middle line:90%
you were protected.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:54.220 align:middle line:84%
So did you have any
kind of training

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.360 align:middle line:90%
for this kind of thing?

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: We did.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.550 align:middle line:84%
We had very extensive
training on mental defenses

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and how to protect
ourselves and setting up

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.290 align:middle line:84%
the barriers to prevent
ourselves from having

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.390 align:middle line:90%
that barrier torn down.

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Because the process that
they were using is-- they

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:19.420 align:middle line:84%
were trying to break
through the mental shields

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.310 align:middle line:90%
that I had set up.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And once those
shields are down, it's

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:31.800 align:middle line:84%
very similar to being
given a truth serum

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.560 align:middle line:84%
in that you don't have
the strength of will

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.400 align:middle line:90%
to resist answering questions.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So they break you down.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.262 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They break
you down, yeah.

00:14:42.262 --> 00:14:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And did they
break you down?

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: They didn't.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Because of your training.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Because of my training.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: As far as
you know, are there

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.850 align:middle line:84%
any secret military
programs that are designed

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.930 align:middle line:90%
to enhance these abilities?

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I know for sure
that it was used in IDARF.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.430 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't a new program.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Again, we weren't guinea
pigs for these operations.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:08.860 align:middle line:84%
So they had developed them over
a period of at least decades

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to fine tune and to hone
the necessary discipline

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and training and skills
that a person has

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:21.580 align:middle line:84%
to practice on a daily basis in
order to be able to fine tune

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.040 align:middle line:90%
and use these abilities.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:29.290 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there is
absolutely a 100% certainty

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.170 align:middle line:84%
that these programs are
currently being used

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:35.210 align:middle line:84%
and have been used
in other projects.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So why can't these
programs be turned against you?

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:45.130 align:middle line:84%
In other words, why can't
they implant things into you

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:46.960 align:middle line:90%
that you think are real?

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And then you go out and tell the
world stories that aren't true.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.290 align:middle line:90%
But you think they're real.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.460 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I'd say it is
absolutely possible.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So how do we
tell the truth then?

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: My own
experiences with events

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.030 align:middle line:84%
that happened over
a period of 20 years

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:17.070 align:middle line:84%
were that they were
too non-sequitur, too

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:21.720 align:middle line:84%
unrelated to anything
conspiracy related or anything

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.910 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with
secret space programs.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And that there, in my own
logic, is no possibility

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:34.140 align:middle line:84%
that that was included
as part of a program

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.370 align:middle line:84%
to get me to come
out and say things.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And that they're
completely and so

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:middle line:84%
far unrelated to it that,
as part of the memory

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:49.870 align:middle line:84%
recollections, just in my
own reasoning behind it,

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:54.917 align:middle line:84%
that it's not part of a memory
program that was given to me.

00:16:54.917 --> 00:16:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you ever see
any occurrence of anything

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.560 align:middle line:84%
like this, where
they took someone

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.430 align:middle line:84%
and put something in their head
to make them think one thing as

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:03.330 align:middle line:90%
opposed to another?

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.849 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:10.619 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I've seen
anecdotal examples of this.

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's been things
that I've read about,

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.380 align:middle line:84%
things that I've researched or
seen or heard or watched videos

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:20.099 align:middle line:84%
on, but nothing
firsthand experientially

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:27.690 align:middle line:84%
except to say that part of the
neural diversion programs that

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:31.350 align:middle line:84%
are used on the
soldiers are just

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.860 align:middle line:84%
that-- to keep us from
discovering the truth

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and having the memory
recalls that we have.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did they ever
use like virtual reality

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:47.250 align:middle line:84%
on you and training or like
the room in "Star Trek"

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.480 align:middle line:84%
where you could go and be
in the jungle or whatever?

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.363 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you ever go
through anything like that?

00:17:52.363 --> 00:17:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Sure, as part of
the downtime that we had

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:59.490 align:middle line:90%
on board ship during transit.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:05.635 align:middle line:84%
We had access to systems
where we were able to utilize,

00:18:05.635 --> 00:18:07.260 align:middle line:84%
for the lack of a
better way of putting

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.630 align:middle line:90%
it, a holodeck, so to speak.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.470 align:middle line:84%
It was a direct
mental feed system

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:17.760 align:middle line:84%
that allowed you to sense
and feel and interact

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.730 align:middle line:84%
with an environment that
wasn't where you were.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.790 align:middle line:84%
There were protocols
built in so that you

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.950 align:middle line:84%
were able to determine
the difference

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:32.010 align:middle line:84%
between a holographic universe
and the real universe.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.460 align:middle line:84%
For starters, there
was no male or female

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.160 align:middle line:90%
within the holographic universe.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:84%
By doing that, it cut out
any possible circumstances

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:49.050 align:middle line:84%
where it could be abused
along those respects.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:52.648 align:middle line:84%
There were also
other key indicators.

00:18:52.648 --> 00:18:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the characters
within the virtual world

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:55.890 align:middle line:90%
were androgynous?

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: So as you went
into the virtual world,

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.460 align:middle line:84%
you did not have a sex,
so to speak, organ.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Right.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.300 align:middle line:90%
I see what you're saying.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:90%
For obvious reasons.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Right, right.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
indicators that

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.980 align:middle line:84%
were used to be able to
determine that, yes, it's not

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:90%
real.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And it is indeed something
that you're immersed in.

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I was talking to
Steven Greer recently.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that
he was told by the CIA

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.670 align:middle line:84%
that they have this
ability to psytronically

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.330 align:middle line:90%
plant ideas into your head.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.760 align:middle line:90%
And this is now.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever encounter
anything like this at all?

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.430 align:middle line:84%
It would seem to me,
to be honest with you,

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.600 align:middle line:84%
if I was your
commanding officer and I

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.110 align:middle line:84%
wanted you to be brave
in battle or something,

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to change
a behavior of yours,

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.990 align:middle line:84%
that I would resort to
this to get your behavior

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.480 align:middle line:84%
to quickly change so that
you're more functional.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.370 align:middle line:90%
Did that ever happen?

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, you
look at the mainstream

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.980 align:middle line:84%
media and the subliminal, or the
hidden, meanings and messages

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.740 align:middle line:84%
that are sent out to
try and program people

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.740 align:middle line:90%
in current civilization.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:12.120 align:middle line:90%
It's being used currently.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, the question
that you were asking

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:19.080 align:middle line:84%
was whether or not that was
a psychological tool used

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.280 align:middle line:84%
to help the commanders achieve
a mission or accomplishment.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Part of the progress with
being able to work through some

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:38.850 align:middle line:84%
of the more painful or traumatic
experiences was to go through

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:84%
and to relive and to
review those experiences

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.170 align:middle line:90%
so that you could clear them.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:54.090 align:middle line:84%
So from an aspect of
not being so traumatized

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:57.870 align:middle line:84%
that you're left in a
corner drooling or crying

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and unfunctional, they did have
extensive help, so to speak.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Like rehab kind of?

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yeah, to try and
process the different things

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.380 align:middle line:90%
that you went through.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:16.150 align:middle line:84%
They also taught certain
dissociative techniques

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:17.980 align:middle line:84%
so that you could
compartmentalize

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.190 align:middle line:84%
it to come back later
so that you were still

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.010 align:middle line:90%
able to function.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
purpose behind training--

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:32.980 align:middle line:84%
is that the muscle memory
and the tasks at hand

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.450 align:middle line:84%
are something that
you can fall back on.

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that
you can stay focused on.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: It would be, seems
to me, a tricky business

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:45.190 align:middle line:84%
because they are in some
ways enhancing your ability.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And you're admitting that
they could manipulate you

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:54.890 align:middle line:84%
if they so desired by taking the
things off the virtual reality

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:57.050 align:middle line:84%
so you didn't know if
it was real or not.

00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:00.085 align:middle line:84%
And it could even make someone
descend into a kind of madness

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:02.390 align:middle line:90%
if they're not careful, right?

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure, make them crazy.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Did they ever do that?

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I would be
surprised if they hadn't

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.240 align:middle line:90%
to try and keep people quiet.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.560 align:middle line:84%
But the other aspect
of the virtual reality

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.730 align:middle line:84%
is that repeated
use of it over time

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:20.470 align:middle line:84%
allowed me to determine
energetically,

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.080 align:middle line:84%
to be able to feel it,
to be able to determine

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.510 align:middle line:90%
that it wasn't real.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.937 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:22:27.937 --> 00:22:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Yeah, having
empathic abilities would

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.230 align:middle line:84%
be kind of bad for virtual
reality because you would know

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:33.080 align:middle line:90%
everything was fake.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Right.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
another aspect of it--

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.250 align:middle line:84%
was the programming
of the virtual reality

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.000 align:middle line:84%
and being able to go to
the beach or take a hike.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.470 align:middle line:90%
And it was still--

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:47.170 align:middle line:84%
as good as it was,
as great and advanced

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:53.320 align:middle line:84%
as the graphics were because it
was direct implant to your mind

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.410 align:middle line:84%
images or views or
feeling of the wind--

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.022 align:middle line:90%
there was still a difference.

00:22:58.022 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So if you
went to the beach,

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.317 align:middle line:90%
you could smell the salt water?

00:23:01.317 --> 00:23:02.117 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah.

00:23:02.117 --> 00:23:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It was a fully
immersive environment.

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:08.620 align:middle line:84%
However, it still was
not the real thing.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:14.980 align:middle line:84%
There are energies associated
with an ocean or a real rock as

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:19.207 align:middle line:84%
opposed to a digitally
enhanced or conveyed rock.

00:23:19.207 --> 00:23:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Close but no cigar.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Right.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:23.720 align:middle line:84%
There's still no substitute
for the real thing.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Correct.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.895 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
disclosure will

00:23:25.895 --> 00:23:27.370 align:middle line:90%
come through these abilities?

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think it'll be more
like flying saucer landing

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.630 align:middle line:90%
on the White House lawn?

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, I think disclosure
is going to happen when enough

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.400 align:middle line:90%
people demand answers--

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.980 align:middle line:90%


00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.820 align:middle line:84%
full disclosure-- because I can
tell you already that the drip,

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.250 align:middle line:84%
drip version is
already happening

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.490 align:middle line:90%
and has been for some time now.

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:84%
You look at just the sheer
amount of new technology

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.870 align:middle line:90%
that's coming out--

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:58.330 align:middle line:84%
last year's DARPA
announcement of developing

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:04.420 align:middle line:84%
a transparent steel or metal and
the use of neural interactions

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:09.850 align:middle line:84%
with both drones as well
as combat soldier robots.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:10.880 align:middle line:90%
These are all--

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Oh, they've
admitted that they

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.457 align:middle line:90%
have invented invisibility.

00:24:16.457 --> 00:24:18.790 align:middle line:84%
So there could be someone in
the room with us right now,

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:19.450 align:middle line:90%
and we wouldn't know it.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:20.325 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:24:20.325 --> 00:24:26.200 align:middle line:84%
The current disclosure plan is
to release those patents that

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.990 align:middle line:84%
are currently held under
national security seals

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:33.040 align:middle line:84%
to research and development
universities or corporations

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:38.080 align:middle line:84%
so that they can then
develop on their own

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:42.070 align:middle line:84%
the technology that's related
to it so that it would appear

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:46.795 align:middle line:84%
as an organically developed
technology, whereas the truth

00:24:46.795 --> 00:24:51.670 align:middle line:84%
that that technology is now
at version eight and exists

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:53.380 align:middle line:90%
isn't what's brought out.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So they're using
corporations to slowly trickle

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:00.670 align:middle line:90%
out all of this stuff.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Corporations--

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.377 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Front corporations.

00:25:03.377 --> 00:25:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: --universities.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And again, these are
all technologies that--

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.130 align:middle line:84%
at least those
that were developed

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:10.480 align:middle line:90%
in the United States--

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.180 align:middle line:84%
that the US taxpayer
has already paid for.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And so now they're a
second time around going

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.940 align:middle line:90%
to have to pay for it again.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And it allows them to slowly
release certain technologies,

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:30.280 align:middle line:84%
to slowly release all
of the advancements that

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.130 align:middle line:84%
have been developed over
the last 50-plus years.

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: In your
opinion, why doesn't--

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:42.460 align:middle line:84%
China is a fairly advanced
country now technologically.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.130 align:middle line:84%
They're pretty much
caught up with us.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:47.530 align:middle line:84%
How come they're not
releasing this stuff?

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I think it
falls back to they

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:56.020 align:middle line:84%
have advanced technologies, as
do other G20 countries that are

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.820 align:middle line:90%
the more developed countries.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:02.560 align:middle line:84%
They all have access to a great
many of these technologies

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.380 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:04.922 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So there must
be a third party

00:26:04.922 --> 00:26:07.330 align:middle line:84%
that's making sure that
nobody's getting this stuff out.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:08.955 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That's holding
them to the fire

00:26:08.955 --> 00:26:10.358 align:middle line:90%
and keeping and preventing it.

00:26:10.358 --> 00:26:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Do you know who
that third party is?

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I would say that it's
going to be cabal related.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's also going to
be ET agreement related.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the ETs are pretty
much watching over everything

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and making sure it trickles
out in the way they want.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I think that there is
a lot of truth to the statement

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.760 align:middle line:84%
that there are certain
ET factions that

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.210 align:middle line:84%
are very concerned with too
much technology coming out

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:37.880 align:middle line:90%
too quickly.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Are these friendly ETs?

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.387 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Who do you ask?

00:26:41.387 --> 00:26:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: I don't know.

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:42.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm asking you.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, I'd
say that depending

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:49.620 align:middle line:84%
on who you ask on whether or not
they're friendly or benevolent,

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:53.550 align:middle line:84%
controlling a lesser
developed species

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.610 align:middle line:84%
and how they
technologically advance

00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:02.790 align:middle line:84%
requires a certain amount
of we-know-better mentality.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:05.700 align:middle line:90%
And is that helpful?

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's a great question.

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:10.230 align:middle line:84%
How much of that do we want
to have our own free will

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:11.460 align:middle line:90%
to decide?

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:15.600 align:middle line:84%
My own thinking is that the
free will to decide what

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and how we do
things is something

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.380 align:middle line:84%
that is a sovereign right
to us and that we ultimately

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.200 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that need
to make that decision.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's not
something that we should

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:29.610 align:middle line:90%
have being dictated to us.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Is there
anything you learned

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:34.860 align:middle line:84%
through your psychic
abilities that you can

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.410 align:middle line:90%
share with us about our future?

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, I would tell
you that the intuitive empath

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:50.020 align:middle line:84%
skills that I had trained
and learned and practiced--

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:54.300 align:middle line:84%
if there was one thing that
I had learned from them,

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.030 align:middle line:84%
it's that we don't
need technology

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:58.890 align:middle line:90%
to be able to attain that.

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.880 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to have technology
intruding into our bodies

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:84%
to be able to attain that type
of skill level or that ability.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's organic right
within ourselves.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Is there anything
that the audience

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:18.030 align:middle line:84%
can do to enhance our own
abilities in these ways,

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.470 align:middle line:90%
these psychic abilities?

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Absolutely.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:26.640 align:middle line:84%
I would say that a way
that was helpful for me--

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:31.470 align:middle line:84%
extremely helpful-- was
meditation, same time each day,

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:36.720 align:middle line:84%
sets up a pattern in your
whole daily biorhythms--

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.440 align:middle line:90%
same time each day.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:44.010 align:middle line:84%
I try to go for 20 minutes to an
hour, the purpose being there's

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:47.010 align:middle line:90%
no wrong way to meditate.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.350 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of
different resources

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.590 align:middle line:84%
out there for different
types of meditations.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:58.290 align:middle line:84%
But the whole concept
being tuning down all

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:00.480 align:middle line:84%
of the other mental
static noise.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And being able to isolate
your own mind and thinking.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And working on addressing
the personal work,

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:14.910 align:middle line:84%
finding out why you emotionally
react to certain topics,

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:17.580 align:middle line:84%
finding out and answering
your own questions

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:22.913 align:middle line:84%
of why you behave certain ways,
and being able to clear those.

00:29:22.913 --> 00:29:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
best thing that we

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:30.750 align:middle line:84%
can do as individuals is
to shine the positive light

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.570 align:middle line:84%
in our every single daily
activities, whether it

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:36.570 align:middle line:84%
is washing the dishes
or driving down the road

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and allowing somebody
to come in front of you.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Use it in every activity
that you do and carrying

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:47.730 align:middle line:84%
that in every single
moment of the activities

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:49.200 align:middle line:90%
that we put forth.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And so that, I think,
is the best thing

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.620 align:middle line:84%
that we can do on
a daily basis that

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:59.030 align:middle line:90%
will yield the best results.

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, that's
certainly good advice.

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.678 align:middle line:84%
Hey, thanks, Jason,
for being on the show.

00:30:03.678 --> 00:30:05.220 align:middle line:84%
