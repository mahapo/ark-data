>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.890 align:middle line:10%
we're joined by Añjali, a former
Pentagon Intelligence Officer

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.590 align:middle line:10%
trained in information
operations and warfare.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.420 align:middle line:10%
Richard Doty also joins us.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.190 align:middle line:10%
A retired
counterintelligence agent

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.900 align:middle line:10%
who served in the
Air Force Office

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:10%
Finally, we have Tim,
a tactical advisor

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.800 align:middle line:10%
to covert analysts trying
to understand the missions

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle line:10%
and strategies of non-human
intelligences on our planet.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.260 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AÑJALI: Thank you.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD DOTY: Thank you.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.875 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you.

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is the
future of contact

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.110 align:middle line:84%
in the hands of the government
agencies or with individuals?

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.045 align:middle line:84%
And what is the difference
between the both?

00:00:54.045 --> 00:00:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, first of all,
I think there is a concerted

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:84%
effort by the United States
government to put out some sort

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.230 align:middle line:84%
of disclosure regarding our
contact with extraterrestrials.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.510 align:middle line:84%
The problem is how
they're going to do that.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of facets
within the governments working

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.920 align:middle line:90%
on this.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Some openly, and some covertly.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And I've had contact
with both sides.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.080 align:middle line:84%
There's also a
congressional committee

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.050 align:middle line:84%
that's working on some
form of disclosure.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.460 align:middle line:84%
The problem there is,
what type of disclosure?

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Are we, the United
States government,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.300 align:middle line:84%
going to disclose everything we
know about the ET phenomenon?

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.730 align:middle line:90%
My answer is no to that.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What do you think, Tim?

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I can basically answer
that for the European side.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Europe is mostly in some
kind of denial about it.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.425 align:middle line:84%
It is decided that disclosure
has to be a global phenomenon.

00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:54.225 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:01:54.225 --> 00:01:55.245 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:01:55.245 --> 00:02:01.290 align:middle line:84%
You cannot disclose something
that important only in one

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.870 align:middle line:90%
localized center of the planet.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Basically, there
will be information

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.090 align:middle line:84%
in different countries
around the world that

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.990 align:middle line:84%
will have a different tone,
a different approach to it.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:84%
I would also say that
different target groups

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:90%
will get different information.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.330 align:middle line:84%
This very friendly and
nice group we have here

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.960 align:middle line:90%
is the best proof to it.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It is.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.468 align:middle line:84%
Añjali, do you have
any comments on that?

00:02:28.468 --> 00:02:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AÑJALI: I do.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.675 align:middle line:84%
I think that what we're seeing
is disclosure right now.

00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:35.475 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:02:35.475 --> 00:02:36.765 align:middle line:84%
>>AÑJALI: Right
here in this room

00:02:36.765 --> 00:02:37.125 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AÑJALI: This is disclosure.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.110 align:middle line:84%
I believe that most of the
disclosure that we will have

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.290 align:middle line:90%
will come from experiences.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And as time goes
on, as we get closer

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.540 align:middle line:84%
to the end of this cycle, we
will see more and more people

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.180 align:middle line:90%
having experiences.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Not only will they be able
to interact more easily

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.810 align:middle line:84%
with other beings,
but they're trying

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.300 align:middle line:84%
to wake up and find their
people that they seeded

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.570 align:middle line:84%
the end of the cycle
with to bring up

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.650 align:middle line:84%
the resonance of human
beings and try to increase

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.730 align:middle line:84%
the number of
consciousnesses here

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.820 align:middle line:84%
that will transcend
into the fourth density.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So with that said,
and with the knowledge

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.070 align:middle line:84%
that the beings very much
believe in free will,

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.610 align:middle line:84%
we also know that we're in
a new age of consciousness.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean
new age woo-woo.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean that we're--

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:84%
across the world, we're
talking about consciousness.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, for the first time
in all of our recollections.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.470 align:middle line:84%
We have different beings on
each side of this spectrum who

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.260 align:middle line:84%
are going to
influence the thinking

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.460 align:middle line:84%
and the conscious
behavior of humanity.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
they're doing that

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.630 align:middle line:90%
is so that we can choose.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So once again, what are
we going to listen to?

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to grab onto
negative thoughts and thinking

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.510 align:middle line:84%
and ideas like, oh,
nobody can handle this.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.920 align:middle line:90%
We must keep it all close to us.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:90%
It's only a threat.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Or are we going to go to
the other side of that?

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's extremely complex,
and we haven't even

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:84%
dealt with the human reaction
of the general public yet.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.475 align:middle line:90%
You know, that concern.

00:04:31.475 --> 00:04:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And so this is like
an iceberg discussion.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:84%
We've got just very
little above the surface.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And all of the
important information

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.670 align:middle line:90%
is really down here.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.515 align:middle line:84%
And we could almost spend
an entire show talking about

00:04:45.515 --> 00:04:46.315 align:middle line:90%
that, I think.

00:04:46.315 --> 00:04:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: We have the unofficial
disclosure going on, and has

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.870 align:middle line:90%
been going on since 1947.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Unfortunately, the
American people or the world

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.520 align:middle line:84%
in a whole are not going to
believe what private groups say

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.130 align:middle line:84%
or a private people
or researchers say.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Or people that are coming
out like us are saying.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.040 align:middle line:84%
They want the word
from the government.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's a segment
of American society,

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.780 align:middle line:90%
and I've met a lot of them.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.080 align:middle line:90%
They don't really care.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:84%
But when something occurs
of a magnitude that

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.800 align:middle line:84%
will affect and
shock this world,

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.300 align:middle line:84%
then you're going
to see everybody--

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.830 align:middle line:84%
all 6 billion people
on this planet look up

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.520 align:middle line:84%
and realize that
something has happened

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.690 align:middle line:84%
and they wish they would have
paid attention in the past.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm talking
about is something

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.110 align:middle line:84%
along the lines of the
movie "The Day the Earth

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Stood Still," the stopping of
electric engines on the planet.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Something to that
effect that would

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.040 align:middle line:84%
get the attention of the
American people or the world

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.910 align:middle line:90%
population.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.050 align:middle line:84%
I think, then the
governments around the world

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.260 align:middle line:90%
will be forced with disclosure.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: All right.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I have to say that an
extreme event is something that

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
must be avoided under
any circumstances

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.420 align:middle line:84%
because we've done some research
upon the behavioral patterns

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.530 align:middle line:84%
of humans under a
scenario of invasion.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Analyzing the
situation that people

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:33.940 align:middle line:84%
had in South America with the
conquistadors going there.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.690 align:middle line:84%
So it shows that
from that psychology,

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.760 align:middle line:84%
people fall into
a state of apathy

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.100 align:middle line:84%
when they fall into
a situation where

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.390 align:middle line:84%
something beyond their
own life experience

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:54.150 align:middle line:84%
happens that invades
and made them into--

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.280 align:middle line:84%
pushes them into the
role of being invaded.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.530 align:middle line:84%
I know that a lot of people
have thought about the scenario

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:07.110 align:middle line:84%
that a fake invasion would be
a good thing to push disclosure

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.170 align:middle line:84%
forward, but it shows
actually that that

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:14.550 align:middle line:84%
could be something that
could shake society

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:21.585 align:middle line:84%
so much that the risk of
it would be purely chaotic.

00:07:21.585 --> 00:07:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>AÑJALI: I would like to
suggest a couple of things.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Number 1 that they
are already here.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's really something
that's very important for us

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.990 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.280 align:middle line:84%
We are surrounded by
life and consciousness.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.260 align:middle line:84%
There is no way to delineate
between us and them,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.490 align:middle line:84%
because it's all the same
thing and they're already here

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.590 align:middle line:90%
because consciousness is here.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And we're like these antennas
that are just so connected

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.560 align:middle line:84%
to them, and all we have to
do is tune in a little bit.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Tune in a little bit, and
we have an open connection.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to suggest that
we approach this subject

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.870 align:middle line:84%
from that foundation rather
than from the foundation,

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I wonder when they're
going to get here.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.140 align:middle line:90%
They're here.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.057 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: They're here.

00:08:13.057 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AÑJALI: They're here.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:14.585 align:middle line:90%
So now, what do we do?

00:08:14.585 --> 00:08:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's happening.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So when we
speak about contact

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:84%
with non-human intelligences,
who are we speaking about?

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.790 align:middle line:90%
Who is that?

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>AÑJALI: I would say that
some of the beings that I know,

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.270 align:middle line:84%
they're beings with a
higher consciousness,

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.940 align:middle line:84%
a higher density of
consciousness light,

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and they no longer have names
because they're not just one

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.510 align:middle line:90%
consciousness anymore.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:50.148 align:middle line:84%
They have come together--
they agreed to come together--

00:08:50.148 --> 00:08:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Before that
collective, huh?

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>AÑJALI: --and use their
knowledge and experience that

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.100 align:middle line:90%
they've learned so far.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.510 align:middle line:84%
They have agreed
to come together.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't have a name by
which they identify themselves

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.170 align:middle line:90%
when we speak.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.435 align:middle line:84%
I know them by their faces
and by the way that they act.

00:09:08.435 --> 00:09:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: There are so many
government entities involved

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.990 align:middle line:90%
in this disclosure process.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And when I speak of we, I'm
talking about the United States

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.410 align:middle line:90%
government.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Since 2017, have really pushing
this thing on and on and on.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.630 align:middle line:84%
In this disclosure process
that we need to bring up,

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:34.170 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about so many
different things along a list,

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.860 align:middle line:90%
but we forget the ETs.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: We forget
what they want.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And these contactees
are the people

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:47.340 align:middle line:84%
that have a relationship
to these ETs can tell us

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.307 align:middle line:90%
like you are doing today.

00:09:50.307 --> 00:09:51.390 align:middle line:90%
But they're not listening.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.100 align:middle line:90%
The government doesn't listen.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing we need to do
is get this agenda on the table

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.650 align:middle line:84%
so they can listen
to these contactees.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Listen to people who have
had contact with them

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:84%
and get their assessment of
how this is going to happen.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Because we can go out and
make a disclosure, but what's

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:20.820 align:middle line:84%
going to happen to the ETs
when they're not ready--

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.470 align:middle line:84%
we're ready but
they're not ready.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Or what happens when they're
ready and we're not ready?

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.545 align:middle line:84%
That's an interesting kind
of a circle to look at.

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So we have the
superpowers of the world,

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.050 align:middle line:84%
like China, Europe,
United States of America.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Who's to say someone won't
raise their hand and say,

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.405 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, I'm
the king of disclosure

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:41.715 align:middle line:84%
and all that energy go
into that one person.

00:10:41.715 --> 00:10:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, I
think realistically,

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:50.370 align:middle line:84%
the United Nations would be the
entity within the world that

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.620 align:middle line:84%
would have to make
that disclosure.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.040 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
there is, everybody's

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.680 align:middle line:84%
afraid of the other
person, and everybody's

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.520 align:middle line:84%
afraid of what other
people's knowledge is.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Our knowledge of the UFO
phenomena or the ET phenomena

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:13.040 align:middle line:84%
is somewhat distinctly different
than the European analogy

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.840 align:middle line:84%
So we have to sit down
and talk about this.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.660 align:middle line:90%
What do you think, Tim?

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, so I
know that there's

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:26.770 align:middle line:84%
a collective effort started
by some human groups,

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.730 align:middle line:84%
and I think the
US American Naval

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Forces were one of them who
initially started and put

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.690 align:middle line:84%
a lot of effort
into that in order

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:42.430 align:middle line:84%
to bring certain countries,
groups, families,

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and companies and everyone
who has a need to know

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.820 align:middle line:84%
or at least has some information
and knowledge about what's

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.915 align:middle line:84%
going on together
and they brought up

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:57.560 align:middle line:90%
the idea of disclosure.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:04.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's made sure that
there's no key player that

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:09.400 align:middle line:84%
jumps out of line and
raises the hand in order

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.970 align:middle line:84%
to bring some information
that might not fit the other.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But what we're also seeing
is that more and more

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:84%
national media is
more and more blocked

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.880 align:middle line:90%
from other national media.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:28.870 align:middle line:84%
So if Russia is, for example,
telling their people who will

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.290 align:middle line:90%
tell you in the United States.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.590 align:middle line:84%
In Europe, for example, Russian
media is completely blocked.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:40.080 align:middle line:90%
So there's no potential--

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:84%
no possible way to
receive this information.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you do so, it
might not make the way

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.890 align:middle line:90%
to mainstream media.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:53.650 align:middle line:84%
So maybe a group of hackers or
something or someone with a VPN

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:59.470 align:middle line:84%
or something could know but that
will not make mainstream media.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:04.180 align:middle line:84%
So there's a tendency
in human organizations

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.370 align:middle line:84%
to keep the narrative
as tightly as

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.990 align:middle line:84%
possible, and in these
roundtable discussions

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:14.200 align:middle line:84%
that have been going
on for several years

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.570 align:middle line:90%
now, in several countries--

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Belgium, Australia,
Brazil, Africa as well,

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.740 align:middle line:84%
it hasn't made
sure that everyone

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.830 align:middle line:90%
is on the mostly same page.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.865 align:middle line:84%
But still, national
information goes first.

00:13:30.865 --> 00:13:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Within our government,
we've had US senators within

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:35.950 align:middle line:90%
the Senate--

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:40.510 align:middle line:84%
the late Harry Reid tried a
disclosure program years ago.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.880 align:middle line:84%
He started the
AATIP program which

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.550 align:middle line:84%
is in the news
almost every day now

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and there's certain people
within that realm that

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:90%
are still working on that.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.540 align:middle line:84%
But the problem we
have is, we have

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:84%
military agencies,
military departments,

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.580 align:middle line:84%
such as the new one,
the United Space

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.830 align:middle line:90%
Force who won't cooperate.

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:04.610 align:middle line:84%
They refuse-- the four-star
general made a statement

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:11.120 align:middle line:84%
on NBC News that when asked
in a news conference, what

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.240 align:middle line:84%
are you doing, what is the
United States Space Force doing

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:90%
on the disclosure program?

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:18.860 align:middle line:84%
He said, we're not
involved and we will not

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.810 align:middle line:90%
be involved in that program.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
So we know, people
within the government

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:84%
knows that most of the data
pertaining to UFOs or UAPs

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.760 align:middle line:84%
went from the United
States Air Force

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.670 align:middle line:84%
and DIA over to the
United States Space Force.

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:90%
And they're sitting on it now.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How can they
not be part of that?

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, nobody's
forcing them to.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:51.200 align:middle line:84%
The general works
for the Secretary

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:90%
of Department of Defense.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:84%
The Secretary
Department of Defense

00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:00.050 align:middle line:84%
is not acknowledging that,
he's not questioning that.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, he doesn't even
know what they have.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
problem right now.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:07.070 align:middle line:84%
There's so many people
within the government

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:11.290 align:middle line:84%
that want disclosure but
don't know what disclosure is.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:12.840 align:middle line:90%
What are we talking about?

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Are we talking about the
fact that a spaceship crashed

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:84%
in Roswell, New
Mexico in 1947, we

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.070 align:middle line:84%
recovered five bodies
and one live ET,

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:27.020 align:middle line:84%
or is it the threat made to
the world that was portrayed

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:90%
to President Reagan in 1981?

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.050 align:middle line:90%
What is disclosure?

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
facets to disclosure

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.560 align:middle line:84%
that could affect so
many elements of society.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.260 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the
religious aspect.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:48.080 align:middle line:84%
What if we disclose something
that the ET told us,

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.830 align:middle line:84%
either through a
contactee or through EBE

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:55.130 align:middle line:84%
or through some
other means that said

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:59.510 align:middle line:84%
that we created your religion
or something to that effect.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Or what if we find
out that they're

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.030 align:middle line:84%
so far advanced that
they've manipulated Earth

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.240 align:middle line:84%
for so many hundreds
of thousands of years

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.170 align:middle line:84%
that we really don't have a
chance to do much on Earth?

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:16.010 align:middle line:84%
These things are hypothetical,
I understand, but what if?

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Those are the questions that
disclosure has to answer.

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:20.810 align:middle line:84%
I've been in
disclosure committees,

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.300 align:middle line:84%
I've been in my
particular group.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.295 align:middle line:84%
And these are the things
that are brought up.

00:16:25.295 --> 00:16:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And another thing,
research and development.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to disclose
to the world what

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.700 align:middle line:90%
the ETs have given us?

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.250 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to disclose how
they communicate with us?

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.710 align:middle line:90%
For instance, through you?

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:41.980 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to do that?

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.290 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.975 align:middle line:84%
So that's the complexity
of the disclosure program.

00:16:45.975 --> 00:16:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely, right.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: There's a lot
of facets to that.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- so one of the
very important questions that we

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:90%
have to ask is, why now?

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.470 align:middle line:84%
What's the reason
for disclosure?

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Because if there's no
motivation or reason,

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.640 align:middle line:84%
there would be no
disclosure because it

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:07.619 align:middle line:84%
had been going on as a system
for 50, 60 years or something.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:08.849 align:middle line:90%
Why change it?

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:12.220 align:middle line:90%
So there is reasons to it.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And one, thing and I'm really
glad that you brought it up,

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and we have the opportunity
to speak about it today,

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.344 align:middle line:84%
is the Earth coming to
an end in it's cycle.

00:17:24.344 --> 00:17:25.144 align:middle line:90%
>>AÑJALI: Yes.

00:17:25.144 --> 00:17:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And that is something
that happens frequently.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.220 align:middle line:84%
It happened before, and
it's going to, potentially,

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.112 align:middle line:84%
happen again, but it's
happening now and--

00:17:34.112 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AÑJALI: That's right.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: --maybe you can
say something about it.

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AÑJALI: Well, they just said
that this is the way that it

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:39.710 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:46.410 align:middle line:84%
That cyclically, the
Earth has an overturning,

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and they just show me
like the crust just

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:54.535 align:middle line:84%
overturning and going from a
normal position on its axis

00:17:54.535 --> 00:17:55.335 align:middle line:90%
like--

00:17:55.335 --> 00:17:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Shift, right.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>AÑJALI: But
really jerky, huge.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Just massive volumes of
water hitting mountains.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Like peaks and
freezing in place.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Other places of water
coming in and then

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.870 align:middle line:90%
receding and leaving nothing.

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.320 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.120 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And they say this
is going to happen.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And that it's normal, it's
a reset for the next cycle--

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.230 align:middle line:90%
the next density cycle on Earth.

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And we're upgrading to
fourth density here.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:37.110 align:middle line:84%
The reason for disclosure now
is that when these changes are

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.240 align:middle line:84%
occurring, we're going
to be really tested

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:84%
and they want us
to understand that.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.990 align:middle line:84%
They also want us to
know that some of us

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.900 align:middle line:84%
are being looked-- they're
looking for us, our family

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.700 align:middle line:90%
and they want us to come back.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.910 align:middle line:84%
There are very high
light beings who

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.300 align:middle line:84%
are saying that all of
this-- this is all illusion

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and we're just playing
some game and that we need

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.257 align:middle line:90%
to realize that and come home.

00:18:59.257 --> 00:19:00.840 align:middle line:84%
That we don't have
to keep doing this,

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.882 align:middle line:84%
we don't have to keep
making ourselves miserable,

00:19:02.882 --> 00:19:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know whether
any of that means.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.230 align:middle line:90%
But it's fascinating to me.

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.610 align:middle line:90%
But I think that there's--

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:12.120 align:middle line:84%
I have been learning just like
the past six months to a year,

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.150 align:middle line:84%
there's science
that's backing up

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:18.720 align:middle line:84%
the idea that there are
physical changes that

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.450 align:middle line:84%
happen to the Earth and
that they are cyclical.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And that we have essentially had
numerous wipeouts of humanity

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.990 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.720 align:middle line:84%
They say it's
happened so many times

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.960 align:middle line:90%
that it's why bother counting.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.170 align:middle line:84%
That there have been so
many cycles of consciousness

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.580 align:middle line:90%
development here.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.440 align:middle line:90%
So they want people to wake up.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.980 align:middle line:84%
They want us to know that
they're here already.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.980 align:middle line:84%
That we can have contact,
and they can prepare us

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:56.130 align:middle line:84%
for the inevitable, because
whenever what happens, comes

00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:04.120 align:middle line:84%
to Earth, it is going
to allow us to see them.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:90%
We will see them.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:10.370 align:middle line:84%
We are going to have
some kind of unveiling

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:12.890 align:middle line:90%
like lifting a veil.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And behind that
veil, are the beings

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:19.050 align:middle line:90%
that we're discussing here.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:20.940 align:middle line:90%
And so we'll see them.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that we
can communicate with them

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle line:90%
is by conscious communication.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.770 align:middle line:84%
So if we begin that
now and we begin

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:34.090 align:middle line:84%
to sharpen our
understanding of who we are,

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:36.300 align:middle line:84%
what we're doing
here and what we

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.260 align:middle line:84%
need to prepare for coming
up, then our transition

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.630 align:middle line:84%
into fourth density, maybe
more of us will choose that,

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:84%
but it will be an
easier transition.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.310 align:middle line:84%
We will understand
what's going on.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:48.880 align:middle line:90%
We won't have to be afraid.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.220 align:middle line:84%
They will help us to understand
that we're not dying.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:57.030 align:middle line:84%
It's just a reset, and we're
doing something different.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And they want us
to understand that

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:90%
so that we make good choices.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.160 align:middle line:84%
They want us to make good
choices when we see them,

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:10.770 align:middle line:84%
when it happens so that we don't
react with fear and violence.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.375 align:middle line:90%
Fear and violence, of terror.

00:21:12.375 --> 00:21:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I'm happy that
we have the opportunity

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:18.660 align:middle line:84%
to talk about it because this
is known for at least 15 years

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.700 align:middle line:84%
to certain groups
on this planet.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.410 align:middle line:84%
It's urgent to speak
about what's happening.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AÑJALI: Yes.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Because what is a planet?

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.850 align:middle line:84%
A planet is basically
a life environment

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:34.425 align:middle line:84%
which offers the opportunity
for consciousness and for bodies

00:21:34.425 --> 00:21:35.340 align:middle line:90%
to make experiences.

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AÑJALI: Yes.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And each planet
itself, each life environment

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.900 align:middle line:84%
has a certain potential
of carrying life forms

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.055 align:middle line:84%
with a certain level
of consciousness.

00:21:45.055 --> 00:21:45.855 align:middle line:90%
>>AÑJALI: Yes.

00:21:45.855 --> 00:21:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And this, we had for
a long time on this planet.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And as you correctly
said, it's an opportunity

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:57.180 align:middle line:90%
for shifting consciousness.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.160 align:middle line:90%
And this has already--

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.290 align:middle line:84%
so that's something
that I've been told

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:06.270 align:middle line:84%
is, it's already been done
in various parallel versions

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:07.710 align:middle line:90%
of Earth already.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So some of us and meaning
like Earth, planets, versions,

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:14.620 align:middle line:90%
parallel Earth.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AÑJALI: Yes.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: They've already done it.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.470 align:middle line:90%
They are like little ahead.

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And they even could
do it without ETs,

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:27.570 align:middle line:84%
without the knowledge of and the
need necessarily for disclosure

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:31.140 align:middle line:84%
because they finally
realized, there's

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.507 align:middle line:90%
no need for different species.

00:22:32.507 --> 00:22:33.465 align:middle line:90%
>>AÑJALI: That's right.

00:22:33.465 --> 00:22:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I can guarantee
that everyone watching here

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:38.970 align:middle line:84%
and everyone in the
room, obviously,

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.950 align:middle line:90%
has to do something with ETs.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So we, basically,
already chose our way

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:48.870 align:middle line:90%
and what we want to see.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's still up to
every single individual

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.615 align:middle line:90%
to make the shift a happy one.

00:22:54.615 --> 00:22:55.675 align:middle line:90%
>>AÑJALI: Exactly.

00:22:55.675 --> 00:22:56.475 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:56.475 --> 00:22:57.275 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:22:57.275 --> 00:23:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AÑJALI: And that's why
now, because we're actually

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:05.370 align:middle line:84%
on a clock of sorts, tik-tok,
tik-tok and it's imminent

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and they can't pinpoint exactly
when it's going to be but they

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.240 align:middle line:84%
keep saying, imminent,
imminent, imminent.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.850 align:middle line:84%
What does that mean to
them, to ancient beings,

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm not really sure.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.510 align:middle line:84%
But that would be a
really good reason

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:21.880 align:middle line:84%
to wake up a lot
of people with it.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Stop sleeping.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:23.170 align:middle line:90%
Wake up.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Do you have details for how
this wave is going to look like,

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.672 align:middle line:90%
how it's going to feel like?

00:23:31.672 --> 00:23:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AÑJALI: I see it.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:38.640 align:middle line:84%
It hums like a wave
that we can't see.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.110 align:middle line:90%
But we can.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:44.580 align:middle line:84%
It's an energetic wave
that is going to come at us

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.065 align:middle line:84%
and it will just travel across
the surface of the Earth.

00:23:47.065 --> 00:23:47.865 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:23:47.865 --> 00:23:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AÑJALI: Just rip everything.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: If you study
astronomy or look at the number

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.690 align:middle line:84%
of satellites we've
launched in orbit,

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:58.350 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find it
NOAA, the National Oceanic

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and Atmospheric Administration,
launched several satellites--

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:08.340 align:middle line:84%
some in the late '90s,
some early 2000s.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And those satellites that are up
there, and you can Google this,

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.890 align:middle line:84%
you can find these
satellites, their main purpose

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:19.700 align:middle line:84%
is to watch Earth
and the oceans.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not to look out in space.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's a scientist,
left NOAA some years ago

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.770 align:middle line:84%
that had a YouTube
channel that talks

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:33.890 align:middle line:84%
about exactly the same thing
that she just mentioned.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:36.470 align:middle line:84%
The changing of the
Earth, the changing

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:40.790 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth's atmosphere,
the anti-radiation belts,

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:43.770 align:middle line:90%
and our oceans.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is all
being held from us.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.160 align:middle line:84%
This is all being
held from the people.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.460 align:middle line:84%
He claims-- now, NOAA comes
out with a statement saying,

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.160 align:middle line:90%
no, that's not true.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just natural
changes in the Earth

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:59.720 align:middle line:90%
is something that affects--

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:84%
will eventually affect her, but
not right in the near future.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And they also talk
about studying the sun

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and seeing a coronal
mass, the ejections that

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.900 align:middle line:90%
are coming from the sun.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you put
those all together,

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.390 align:middle line:90%
there's changes coming to Earth.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.280 align:middle line:84%
It might not be
today or tomorrow,

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.890 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to be in
sometime in the future,

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:22.070 align:middle line:90%
and what's going to happen?

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to be some
sort of a turbulent time

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.210 align:middle line:84%
period that's going to wipe
out some of our population?

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well I believe that
a catastrophe is definitely

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.120 align:middle line:90%
going to happen of some sort.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:38.225 align:middle line:84%
But then when I speak to Tim,
we don't want that to happen.

00:25:38.225 --> 00:25:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And I know the ETs don't
want that to happen.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Tim, would they actually step in
to prevent something like that

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.440 align:middle line:90%
or--

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I would say they
already are, right?

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So we wouldn't have this
conversation if they didn't.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And I defend myself
and everyone else

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:02.450 align:middle line:84%
from saying a catastrophe must
happen, which is not the case.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:08.450 align:middle line:84%
It's still-- and I'm
emphasizing that every one of us

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:11.330 align:middle line:84%
is creating the
way it turns out.

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is the most
critical time of all times

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.800 align:middle line:84%
and of every life's a
life on this planet.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.120 align:middle line:84%
So you have a responsibility,
first for yourself,

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.990 align:middle line:84%
and then for every
other aspect of what

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:28.890 align:middle line:90%
you hold dear in your own home.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So manifest as much as possible,
speak it into existence,

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:42.540 align:middle line:84%
meditate, connect yourself,
prepare yourself, and make it

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:43.340 align:middle line:90%
a happy shift.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Manifest to protect
the planet, we'll say.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think people need to
start thinking about that.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Añjali, the
time period of the cycle,

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:02.960 align:middle line:84%
are they giving it an Earth
time period or just in a general

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.660 align:middle line:90%
sense?

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.605 align:middle line:84%
How are they
describing it in time?

00:27:06.605 --> 00:27:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>AÑJALI: Are you asking me
how long a cycle is or about

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:11.570 align:middle line:90%
the end of it?

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Oh, goodness.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of years
all the way back

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:23.790 align:middle line:90%
to Christ, and Buddha, Krishna.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Just keep going back,
it's all the same cycle.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:33.700 align:middle line:84%
We're recycling the information
from earlier in the same cycle.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.280 align:middle line:90%
And so yeah.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.160 align:middle line:84%
They were all-- it's
been thousands of years.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: But we don't know
when the end is coming?

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:42.795 align:middle line:90%
We don't--

00:27:42.795 --> 00:27:45.525 align:middle line:90%
>>AÑJALI: Right.

00:27:45.525 --> 00:27:49.723 align:middle line:84%
I get the sense that it's going
to be in the next decade, OK?

00:27:49.723 --> 00:27:50.523 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Oh, yeah.

00:27:50.523 --> 00:27:51.795 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Oh, yeah.

00:27:51.795 --> 00:27:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>AÑJALI: They
have shown me 2027,

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:57.990 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
what happens then.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:01.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that's the
beginning of it moving faster,

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:05.370 align:middle line:84%
but they have shown me the
actual Earth and everything

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:07.680 align:middle line:84%
just moving faster
like we're all just--

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.360 align:middle line:84%
everything is happening
at a faster rate,

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.120 align:middle line:90%
and it's not our imagination.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.860 align:middle line:90%
Actually is.

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:20.850 align:middle line:84%
They've put an actual date
to when it should happen--

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and when I say they,
I mean, generals.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is not, basically,
my information--

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:32.760 align:middle line:84%
my personal which
I could attest.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't quote
them, because the way

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:46.380 align:middle line:84%
universal phenomena happen,
it's very hard, quite

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.300 align:middle line:90%
impossible to calculate it.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:29:00.190 align:middle line:84%
It's more like events that needs
certain conditions to be true.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:02.035 align:middle line:90%
And in that case, that happens.

00:29:02.035 --> 00:29:02.835 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:29:02.835 --> 00:29:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What can
we tell our audience

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.125 align:middle line:84%
to deal with this upcoming
shift or the shift we're

00:29:08.125 --> 00:29:09.125 align:middle line:90%
going through right now?

00:29:09.125 --> 00:29:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>AÑJALI: Well, first of
all, that we are all a single

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.620 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And that we need to
really start trying

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:24.750 align:middle line:84%
to grapple with what that
means for us as individuals

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and how we're going
to approach that.

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I like to tell people, well,
fake it until you make it.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Tell yourself every
day that we are one.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Look at your neighbor
and don't feel

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:46.660 align:middle line:84%
like they're a separate thing
that you have to compete with,

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.640 align:middle line:84%
but instead, it's
an extension of you.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.310 align:middle line:84%
It's an expression
of consciousness

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:57.370 align:middle line:84%
trying to learn and
even deeper than that.

00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:00.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the expression
of the creator who has

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:05.480 align:middle line:90%
forgotten himself, all of them.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And if we can remember that and
understand that energy never

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:15.710 align:middle line:84%
dissipates, energy isn't
destroyed, it becomes--

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:17.180 align:middle line:90%
it's transformational.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Light isn't destroyed,
it's transformational.

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And as everything else
that is demonstrated

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:31.170 align:middle line:84%
around us on this planet,
life is transformational.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.810 align:middle line:84%
This was never meant to be a
permanent situation for any

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:35.610 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:39.150 align:middle line:84%
This is an opportunity
for consciousness growth.

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And we just have to just
seize that opportunity.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.790 align:middle line:84%
To take it all in and to
understand that when this is

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:49.810 align:middle line:90%
done, there's something else.

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.900 align:middle line:90%
This is just temporary, guys.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.120 align:middle line:84%
This isn't the beginning
and an end of anything.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.460 align:middle line:90%
This is just an expression.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:30:57.630 --> 00:30:59.860 align:middle line:90%
It must change at some point.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:04.200 align:middle line:84%
We all know that
maybe, at some times,

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.510 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to
admit it and we might

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:08.050 align:middle line:90%
have different feelings to it.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:12.210 align:middle line:84%
But then there's this
awkward but very interesting

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:15.840 align:middle line:84%
quality to consciousness
that we are constantly

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.360 align:middle line:84%
projecting outside
and perceiving inside,

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.010 align:middle line:84%
which makes us one with
the perception itself

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:25.350 align:middle line:84%
and the field itself,
which gives us

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:29.460 align:middle line:84%
not only the responsibility,
but also the possibility

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:33.390 align:middle line:84%
and the power to change how
we want to perceive things.

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And I can only encourage
every aspect of us

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:42.930 align:middle line:84%
to make sure, to care
for your loved ones,

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:48.270 align:middle line:84%
manifest for them too,
manifest for yourself, do it.

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:49.095 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:49.095 --> 00:31:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>AÑJALI: I would agree
with that entirely.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.440 align:middle line:84%
They have said that,
I have the tattoo.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.090 align:middle line:84%
With our thoughts,
we make the world

00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:00.180 align:middle line:84%
but they have been very,
very clear that that's

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.650 align:middle line:90%
exactly what is happening here.

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:06.450 align:middle line:84%
This is the creator having
this incredible dream,

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.220 align:middle line:84%
and we're all tied
up in it and we

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:12.700 align:middle line:84%
think that we're
these separate beings.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And so we've
manifested all of this.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:22.040 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to
manifest anything that we want.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.160 align:middle line:84%
But we have to do
it collectively.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And see, that's the problem
that we're having here.

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:33.955 align:middle line:84%
We need a collective effort at
positively changing our world.

00:32:33.955 --> 00:32:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yes.

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Knowing about this
end of the cycle,

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:41.380 align:middle line:84%
this is the reason why
at minute number 1,

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:45.280 align:middle line:84%
I brought up this Earth
shift happily now phrase

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.640 align:middle line:84%
in order for everyone to have
a guideline or something to do,

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.130 align:middle line:90%
which is just one sentence.

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:53.607 align:middle line:84%
We can do it right
before you sleep just--

00:32:53.607 --> 00:32:54.565 align:middle line:90%
>>AÑJALI: That's right.

00:32:54.565 --> 00:32:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: --but whatever fits
you, whatever suits people,

00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:59.180 align:middle line:90%
whatever--

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:03.670 align:middle line:84%
if they connect with Jesus,
with something as meditation,

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:06.280 align:middle line:84%
whatever idea they
have, just make sure

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.640 align:middle line:84%
that every aspect
that you hold dear

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:14.680 align:middle line:84%
has the best possible
shift there is.

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And I love that the
community and people outside

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:21.610 align:middle line:84%
have modified the sentence
to all shift happily now,

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:24.755 align:middle line:84%
