>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.030 align:middle line:10%
we are with Richard Doty,
a retired special agent

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.830 align:middle line:10%
who served in the
Air Force Office

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.480 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.620 align:middle line:90%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Today we are discussing his
work on other special projects.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.488 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.488 --> 00:00:37.572 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD DOTY: Thank you.

00:00:37.572 --> 00:00:38.700 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is Area 20,
and what did you do there?

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: OK.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.780 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
we were able to do

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.030 align:middle line:84%
was make connections
with people within DARPA

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.770 align:middle line:84%
to go out to a site
and observe an ET

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.120 align:middle line:90%
craft that had been captured.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we first dealt
with these people that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.300 align:middle line:84%
were going to take
us out there, they

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.930 align:middle line:84%
kept telling us the Nevada Test
Site, the Nevada Test Site.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, I knew Nevada Test Site.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.460 align:middle line:84%
I had been out there
numerous times.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.650 align:middle line:84%
But I'm thinking
they meant Area 51,

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.300 align:middle line:84%
because why would an ET craft
be stored in a Nevada Test Site?

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
But they kept telling
us we were going

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.200 align:middle line:84%
to be taken to Area 20, which
is in the northwest corner

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
of the Nevada Test Site, not
far from Area 51 or not far

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:90%
from Tonopah.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And I kept doubting the
people that were with me,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.660 align:middle line:84%
the scientists
that were with me.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:84%
I kept doubting that we're
not going to go to Area 20.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.820 align:middle line:84%
That might be where
we're going to stage.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:84%
But from that point-- and
this is in 1996, I think.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.640 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go into Area 51.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.280 align:middle line:84%
We had to get special
passes, and so forth.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, lo and behold, when we
got to Mercury, Nevada, which

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.380 align:middle line:84%
is an entryway into Nevada Test
Site, they put us in a van, six

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.290 align:middle line:84%
by van, and we
drove up to Area 20.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.790 align:middle line:84%
We went through the
gate at Area 20.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.889 align:middle line:84%
We went up and around
and into this enclosed

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.740 align:middle line:84%
area that was heavily guarded
with a private security

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:90%
company.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Not the Wackenhut
Security that was--

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.200 align:middle line:84%
that normally guards
the Nevada Test Site.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.200 align:middle line:90%
But this was separate.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And what really
surprised me, which

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.510 align:middle line:84%
I am somewhat
hesitant about saying,

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.820 align:middle line:84%
the arm patches on these
people had DARPA security.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, I never heard of DARPA
having a security force,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.210 align:middle line:90%
but they maybe do.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, we were allowed in,
and there was a huge building.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.660 align:middle line:84%
I didn't-- I wouldn't
call it a hangar.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.000 align:middle line:84%
It was 1,000-square
foot building.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And we were allowed
to go into a door,

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.850 align:middle line:84%
and we had to go through
several security checkpoints

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.900 align:middle line:84%
to get into an open bay
area, a huge open bay area.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And sitting in the
middle of this area

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.700 align:middle line:84%
is this huge, huge
flying saucer.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What's huge to you?

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.240 align:middle line:90%
100 yards, or--

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: 50 foot in diameter.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: 50 foot in diameter.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: At least.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And from the bottom part of
the craft at the top dome

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.320 align:middle line:90%
was probably 50 feet also.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:84%
The bottom portion
of it had opened.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.800 align:middle line:90%
It was open.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.440 align:middle line:90%
And it was a gateway.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't appear to be
something extraterrestrial.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.820 align:middle line:84%
It looked to me like there
was just normal steps

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.180 align:middle line:84%
that we would bring up
and put there, a ladder.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:84%
A ladder or some-- actually,
like the old aircraft--

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, right--

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --ladders or gateway
that you would walk down.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.020 align:middle line:84%
It was something
similar to that.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And the person that
was leading us in there

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and was narrating this
said, this craft was found--

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.390 align:middle line:90%
it was crashed.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, we could see a lot
of damage on this craft.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.700 align:middle line:84%
The one section-- one section
to our right, the undercarriage

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.630 align:middle line:90%
was damaged.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Another section to the
left, parts of the craft

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.260 align:middle line:90%
had been broken off.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.209 align:middle line:84%
The undercarriage
of where the dome

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.019 align:middle line:84%
system was on the undercarriage
was heavily damaged.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So it appeared to
me that the craft

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.120 align:middle line:84%
had crashed into something
heavy, maybe rock

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.170 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Or did
we shoot it down?

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.798 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, we
weren't told that.

00:04:30.798 --> 00:04:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It's very possible.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.370 align:middle line:84%
I think it was-- some of
the consensus was some

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.410 align:middle line:84%
of the scientists not there,
but later on when we were back

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.720 align:middle line:84%
in Las Vegas was talking
about the fact that, hey,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.280 align:middle line:90%
was that a missile--

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.020 align:middle line:90%
damage caused by a missile?

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Was that caused by a rocket
or maybe anti-aircraft?

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, we don't know.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.810 align:middle line:90%
We weren't told.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.270 align:middle line:84%
We were allowed to
walk inside of it.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.190 align:middle line:84%
The interior of it was huge,
but it was obviously that--

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.860 align:middle line:84%
obviously that someone--
not us, our people--

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.250 align:middle line:84%
had taken things
out, disassembled.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Because you could
see where things

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.560 align:middle line:84%
had been cut with some
kind of a saw or laser.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Like, the console system
had been taken out

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.800 align:middle line:84%
and it was sitting
up against the side

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.020 align:middle line:90%
of the interior of the craft.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And you could look down
and see down in the area

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:84%
where there were huge tanks,
several numerous tanks.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And there were rods
that were in these tanks

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:41.910 align:middle line:84%
with pinpoints leading up
into maybe another section.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And we weren't told what it
was, but of course, later on,

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:84%
these scientists just
went crazy about,

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:90%
that's the propulsion system.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.780 align:middle line:90%
That's an antimatter system.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.250 align:middle line:90%
We know how this works.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.010 align:middle line:90%
And they went all into detail.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So this craft probably had an
antimatter propulsion system.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:59.948 align:middle line:90%
And then we were--

00:05:59.948 --> 00:06:01.990 align:middle line:84%
it was difficult to move
around in it, the craft,

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.540 align:middle line:90%
because it had been torn up.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.480 align:middle line:84%
There's things
scattered all over.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.587 align:middle line:84%
We could only go maybe 20 feet
in, and then we could look.

00:06:11.587 --> 00:06:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And we weren't allowed
to take any pictures,

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.590 align:middle line:84%
but we'd look at different
sections of the craft.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And after about 20 minutes or
so they said, OK, that's it.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.720 align:middle line:84%
You guys can make
your own decisions

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.853 align:middle line:90%
on what you're seeing here.

00:06:22.853 --> 00:06:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists kept
saying, well, how can we get

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.110 align:middle line:90%
briefed into this and how--

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.910 align:middle line:90%
more into it?

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:28.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.562 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And of course,
one of the questions

00:06:30.562 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle line:84%
was, why is this here
and not at Area 51?

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.810 align:middle line:90%
And one of the-- our narrator--

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.860 align:middle line:84%
only one person
ever talked to us.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.960 align:middle line:84%
He was probably a younger
guy, probably in his 30s,

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.520 align:middle line:90%
not that old.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.170 align:middle line:90%
Very distinguished-looking.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.280 align:middle line:84%
He had a very, very neat
appearance, an outfit on,

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.455 align:middle line:90%
a one-piece-- like a jumpsuit.

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.330 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have any
patches or anything on it.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.810 align:middle line:84%
When asked, why is it being
kept here, and he said,

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.960 align:middle line:90%
that's our business.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.320 align:middle line:90%
And the--

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Maybe they
got a good deal on it.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: [LAUGHS] I
think one of the reasons

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.830 align:middle line:84%
is it's so big that
it might not fit.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Because I had been
in-- you know,

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.010 align:middle line:84%
eight years prior,
I was at Area 51.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't have any--

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.010 align:middle line:90%
now they do.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.320 align:middle line:84%
They've built a lot
of the larger hangars.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to
myself, that's probably

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.340 align:middle line:84%
why, because then
maybe they didn't

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.780 align:middle line:90%
have anything big enough.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
next question was,

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.680 align:middle line:90%
how did you guys get this here?

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is big.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you couldn't
have flown it here.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.570 align:middle line:90%
It's damaged.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't have
transported it here.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.360 align:middle line:90%
How did it get here?

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And he wouldn't
answer that question.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So that's it
what those wide load

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.750 align:middle line:90%
trucks are in Nevada there.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It would have to
be really, really wide.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I
could think of is

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.310 align:middle line:84%
they'd had to pick it up with
one of those helicopters,

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.160 align:middle line:84%
the cranes I think they call
them, or the heavy transport.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And I don't even
know-- it looked very heavy.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was bumping
against the sides

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.190 align:middle line:84%
inside, trying to
see if it was--

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.930 align:middle line:90%
and it was very thick metal.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Solid.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Solid metal.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can you
describe the inside

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.170 align:middle line:84%
to the best of
your recollection?

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, the
cavity, the interior

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.635 align:middle line:84%
of the cavity that
we were in was huge.

00:08:14.635 --> 00:08:15.890 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge cavity.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.100 align:middle line:84%
It had been
disassembled, tore up.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.030 align:middle line:84%
It looked like everything
had been cut by something.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.510 align:middle line:90%
And the roof was very high.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Like, it went up into
the dome that you

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:90%
could see from the outside.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:35.780 align:middle line:84%
There were-- it looked like
they had seats, various seats up

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.370 align:middle line:84%
above, in a deck up above,
and in a second deck,

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.799 align:middle line:84%
and then that's
what we could see.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interior
area that we were at,

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.480 align:middle line:84%
it was very difficult
to make out anything

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.520 align:middle line:84%
because it had
been disassembled.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.005 align:middle line:90%
The metal was very thick.

00:08:52.005 --> 00:08:54.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we weren't able to
actually go up and analyze it.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.710 align:middle line:84%
But you could just look at it
and see how thick everything

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:58.948 align:middle line:90%
was, the console was.

00:08:58.948 --> 00:09:01.490 align:middle line:84%
We weren't able to actually look
at the front of the console,

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:02.660 align:middle line:90%
because it was laid--

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.630 align:middle line:84%
that part of the console was
leaning against the wall.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.750 align:middle line:90%
There was a peculiar ball, bulb.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like one of these
huge beach balls.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, probably
an oversized beach

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:84%
ball that was on some kind
of a pedestal in the front.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I would call it the
front, because we reasoned

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.460 align:middle line:84%
that if you reassembled
that control panel,

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.410 align:middle line:90%
then that would be the front.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists
were figuring this out.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was able to go over
and put my hand on this.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.270 align:middle line:90%
It was flexible.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:38.240 align:middle line:84%
It was heavy-- heavy
material like it's real

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.370 align:middle line:90%
hard and difficult to explain.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.370 align:middle line:84%
But it was-- and
I could indent it.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Like a memory
foam, but plastic?

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.880 align:middle line:90%
But harder than memory foam.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And I could
press into it.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to spin it,
because it seemed like it

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:90%
was on some sort of a pedestal.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:55.928 align:middle line:84%
I'd looked down,
and there was a rod

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:84%
that it seemed to be sitting--
the center portion of it

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:84%
was sitting on, on
some kind of a rod.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was embedded into
the bottom of the floor.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And it appeared to
me it would spin.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:12.232 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was some sort
of a gauge or something.

00:10:12.232 --> 00:10:13.190 align:middle line:90%
But I couldn't spin it.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:14.120 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't move it.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I could just push
my hand into it.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.250 align:middle line:90%
And the floor was heavy.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:24.230 align:middle line:84%
The entranceway-- I could--
we couldn't see any doors.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.980 align:middle line:84%
They probably were
encased into the wall

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.430 align:middle line:84%
and would come out or something
that the scientists would get.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was with the scientists
when we went back to Las Vegas

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.010 align:middle line:84%
at the hotel we were
staying at, and we had kind

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.840 align:middle line:90%
of a round table discussion.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And they immediately
started diagramming

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and making sketches of
what they remembered,

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.198 align:middle line:90%
and writing down as--

00:10:46.198 --> 00:10:48.740 align:middle line:84%
actually, while we were driving
back, they were writing down.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:84%
They had notebooks filled in
just the hour it took us to get

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.050 align:middle line:90%
to Vegas of what they observed.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were more
observers than I was.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And they asked me to do
the same thing, and I did.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.280 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I had
three or four pages,

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and they had 30
or 40 by the time

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.110 align:middle line:84%
we got back there
because I don't know what

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm supposed to be looking at.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.420 align:middle line:84%
But I sat down
with the scientists

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:12.650 align:middle line:84%
and they start reasoning, number
one, that's an anti-pod system.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:13.790 align:middle line:90%
We know how that works.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.370 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:20.030 align:middle line:84%
The undercarriage portion
of that thick area

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:24.080 align:middle line:84%
was filled with a gas,
and the antimatter

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.450 align:middle line:90%
was trapped in this gas.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And they probably even
talked about the gas,

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and I can't remember
what the gas was.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And the other sections were
matter, positive matter.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And they would induce
the matter together

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.690 align:middle line:84%
and the bottom
portion would open up,

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and that would be the
propellant or the energy that

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.390 align:middle line:90%
was released when you--

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:90%
positive and negative matter.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking about
this and how this operated.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And then they drew the interior
showing the control panel

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.900 align:middle line:84%
where it would probably--
they thought it would be.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And what we didn't know was what
the display panel looked like,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.500 align:middle line:84%
whether there were handprint
indentations like we'd

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.610 align:middle line:90%
seen before.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Once they got back
to the Institute,

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:14.400 align:middle line:84%
then they started drawing
concepts of what this was.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And-- but we didn't
know where it came from.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:21.660 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know what alien
race or extraterrestrial race

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.968 align:middle line:84%
that flew it or where it crashed
or where it was shot down.

00:12:25.968 --> 00:12:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: While you
were in the craft,

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.732 align:middle line:84%
were there any different
scents or smells?

00:12:30.732 --> 00:12:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, it
was dark in there.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:35.220 align:middle line:84%
The only lighting was
lighting they had brought in,

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.650 align:middle line:84%
portable lighting systems they
had inside all over the place.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And there were cables running
outside to generators.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:45.470 align:middle line:84%
It smelt to me almost
like an ozone--

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.450 align:middle line:90%
you know, this chemical smell?

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: At certain times.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Or when you do an experiment
where you burn a wire,

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:57.520 align:middle line:84%
you get this ozone
type of smell.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.130 align:middle line:84%
That's the odor that
I detected inside.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of the
scientists claim

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.430 align:middle line:84%
that the odor was more
like something had been

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.110 align:middle line:90%
burnt-- metal had been burned.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Now, I didn't detect that.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.048 align:middle line:84%
I detected that kind
of an ozone smell.

00:13:13.048 --> 00:13:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So there
was another project

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:18.250 align:middle line:84%
that brought you to an
elderly scientist in Roswell.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell us
more about that?

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:24.430 align:middle line:84%
One of my assignments
was to determine

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:29.740 align:middle line:84%
whether there were any elderly,
retired scientists alive

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.480 align:middle line:84%
that had maybe experienced
Roswell or any other ET crash

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.760 align:middle line:90%
sites or information.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:41.140 align:middle line:84%
So I reviewed-- I went and I
reviewed all the information I

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.330 align:middle line:90%
could find on these scientists.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, I find a
name on a roster, an old roster,

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.780 align:middle line:84%
that was still classified
that the government had

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:57.158 align:middle line:84%
that we had access to, which
listed a name of a scientist.

00:13:57.158 --> 00:13:59.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were several
there, but all of them

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.090 align:middle line:90%
had died or--

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.350 align:middle line:90%
they passed away.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.120 align:middle line:90%
But there was one still--

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.650 align:middle line:90%
apparently still alive.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:07.210 align:middle line:84%
So I had to do
some checks on him,

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:09.370 align:middle line:84%
and I had to go through
some different agencies

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:90%
to do checks.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, I find this
guy is still alive and lives

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:17.230 align:middle line:90%
in Bonita Springs, Florida.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So I-- rather than trying
to find him, calling him,

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.450 align:middle line:84%
I flew down to Florida,
went to Bonita Springs,

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.730 align:middle line:84%
got the address, went
to this guy's house.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.443 align:middle line:84%
And out of the clear, I
just knocked on his door.

00:14:31.443 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And I figured, you know,
somebody else would answer,

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.320 align:middle line:90%
but he answered.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:90%
A lively 95-year-old man.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.570 align:middle line:90%
I said-- I introduced myself.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.250 align:middle line:84%
I told him I was
from the Institute

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.350 align:middle line:90%
for Advanced Studies at Austin.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.750 align:middle line:90%
He said, oh.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.190 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Puthoff's place.

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.300 align:middle line:84%
I work for Dr.
Puthoff, and I'm here

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:84%
to ask you some
questions about Roswell,

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.290 align:middle line:84%
because I believe
you were there.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.090 align:middle line:90%
He said, sure.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:14:59.540 align:middle line:90%
Come on in.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: [LAUGHS]

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And this guy was in
shorts because it's Florida

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.810 align:middle line:84%
and this is, like,
May, I believe it was.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.710 align:middle line:90%
And he said, come on back.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:09.510 align:middle line:90%
What can I get you?

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.510 align:middle line:84%
An orange drink or
lemonade or whatever.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:13.310 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure.

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.970 align:middle line:90%
Just lemonade.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.637 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking around
for other people,

00:15:15.637 --> 00:15:17.420 align:middle line:90%
but he lives here by himself.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, do you have a
housekeeper or somebody?

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:24.140 align:middle line:84%
He says, I'm fit enough to
take care of the house myself.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.990 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't want to offend him.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.790 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, OK.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:90%
How old are you?

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:28.970 align:middle line:90%
And he told me 95.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:90%
So we sat down.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.980 align:middle line:84%
He said, what do
you need to know?

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked him
questions about Roswell.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:90%
You were at Roswell?

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.822 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I was at the crash site.

00:15:36.822 --> 00:15:38.030 align:middle line:90%
Which crash site were you at?

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:39.590 align:middle line:90%
And he told me the Corona site.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, with the debris,
or were you at-- he

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.160 align:middle line:84%
said, well, we initially went
to the debris site first,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.690 align:middle line:90%
and we found the debris.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:51.200 align:middle line:84%
He said, but the debris
field was the tail section

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.200 align:middle line:90%
of the spacecraft.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.240 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't the craft.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.040 align:middle line:90%
I said, wait.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.460 align:middle line:90%
I knew of that.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.820 align:middle line:84%
But the craft landed some
distance away, about 10 miles

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.710 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it was away.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.187 align:middle line:90%
And I later went there.

00:16:02.187 --> 00:16:03.770 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what
did you find there?

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.570 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, when we
got there-- and I said,

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:07.830 align:middle line:90%
how many people were with you?

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I was with
two other scientists and then

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:15.650 align:middle line:84%
two other military people, two
officers, military officers.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.465 align:middle line:90%
And we got there.

00:16:17.465 --> 00:16:22.380 align:middle line:90%
The live alien had left.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.000 align:middle line:90%
They'd taken him away.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.505 align:middle line:84%
But the bodies were still
there of the entities.

00:16:26.505 --> 00:16:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, did
you examine the bodies?

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:28.830 align:middle line:90%
He says, well, no.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a medical officer,
but they had medical people

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.220 align:middle line:90%
there doing that.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.820 align:middle line:84%
He said, they had a
pathologist from Kirtland Field

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.950 align:middle line:90%
that was there to do that.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, can you
describe what you saw?

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.920 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, yeah,
about four foot--

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.160 align:middle line:84%
he described what I had
talked about before.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.620 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what
about the live one?

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I don't know
where they took that one.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.260 align:middle line:84%
But my expertise is
I'm a metallurgist,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.910 align:middle line:84%
so I wanted to know what
this craft was made of.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so you
went in the craft?

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:01.470 align:middle line:90%
He said, no.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.740 align:middle line:84%
We examined the outer area,
but the craft had been--

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.079 align:middle line:84%
was going to be transported
to another location.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.345 align:middle line:84%
And so he talked about
the craft, and he said,

00:17:10.345 --> 00:17:11.970 align:middle line:84%
well, we went back
to the debris field,

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.310 align:middle line:84%
because we needed to gather
some evidence back there.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and so we talked
for probably an hour, an hour

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.300 align:middle line:90%
and a half.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I thought you were
one of the government officials

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.360 align:middle line:84%
that were going to come here
to take something away from me.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:26.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.755 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: And I said, no, no.

00:17:29.755 --> 00:17:30.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm with the Institute.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a government agent.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
you talk like--

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.740 align:middle line:90%
once you're in a field of--

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.730 align:middle line:90%
I mean, a federal--

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: He's picking up on it.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.175 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: He said,
you kind of talk

00:17:40.175 --> 00:17:43.270 align:middle line:84%
like an interrogator rather
than an investigator.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Very smart guy.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.425 align:middle line:90%
95 years old.

00:17:45.425 --> 00:17:46.225 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:17:46.225 --> 00:17:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: He's on to you.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I do come across
sometimes like that.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:50.670 align:middle line:90%
I did back then.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:51.837 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, I'm very--

00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:52.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.290 align:middle line:84%
I used to work in
intelligence a long time ago,

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:57.850 align:middle line:90%
but I don't work there anymore.

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm a private citizen.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.570 align:middle line:84%
I work for the Institute
for Advanced Studies.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.160 align:middle line:90%
I said, what did you keep?

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, you're not
going to take it from me?

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.660 align:middle line:84%
I said, I won't take
anything from you, sir.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:84%
So he went into this room
and got this box out,

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.230 align:middle line:90%
and he had a piece of debris.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh my goodness.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And it was about
10 to 12 inches long.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And he brought it out
and he set it down.

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:19.930 align:middle line:90%
He said, play with it.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:20.770 align:middle line:90%
So I played with it.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.270 align:middle line:90%
He said, wad it up.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:23.590 align:middle line:90%
And it was hard to wad up.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:26.740 align:middle line:84%
But you wad it up, you set
it down, it goes right back

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.580 align:middle line:90%
to the same shape.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: No
wrinkles, no creases.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: No wrinkles, no creases.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.960 align:middle line:84%
I said, that's like
kind of memory foam.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.960 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, that's
kind of what we thought.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.690 align:middle line:84%
But I never found out,
which still haunts

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.073 align:middle line:90%
me today is what it's made of.

00:18:44.073 --> 00:18:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: He said this.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.865 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: He said this.

00:18:45.865 --> 00:18:48.650 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, you don't think
they figured it out by now?

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.860 align:middle line:90%
He said, you tell me.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I'm
not a scientist, sir.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm a field investigator.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.103 align:middle line:84%
He said, well-- and he started
asking me about college.

00:18:58.103 --> 00:18:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Did you go to college?

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I went to college, but my
degree was in political science

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.080 align:middle line:84%
with a minor in
education, so I'm not--

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a scientist, so I
can't tell you what they found.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.180 align:middle line:84%
He said, but you work
at the Institute.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And he started asking
me questions about that.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.320 align:middle line:90%
I said, I'll tell you what.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Would you agree to have the
Institute scientists come out

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.700 align:middle line:90%
and talk to you?

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:21.490 align:middle line:90%
I tried to contact--

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:23.930 align:middle line:84%
I sent Dr. Puthoff a
letter some years ago,

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.115 align:middle line:90%
and I never got a response.

00:19:25.115 --> 00:19:26.740 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'll guarantee
you you're going

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.640 align:middle line:90%
to get a response this time.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I took
photographs of it, and I

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:34.960 align:middle line:90%
went back and made contacts.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.980 align:middle line:84%
The other scientists then just
a few days later flew out there,

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't--

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.657 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't privy to
what they found.

00:19:41.657 --> 00:19:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, really?

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:44.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: But that was one of my--

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.220 align:middle line:84%
my field-- field projects
that I did for him.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was there anything
else that he said that you never

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.010 align:middle line:90%
heard before?

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: I think the--

00:19:54.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle line:84%
how-- how they
examined the craft.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Not the debris field
so much, but the craft,

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and how they connected the
debris field with the craft.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.128 align:middle line:84%
Because initially, they
thought there was two craft.

00:20:09.128 --> 00:20:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, there actually were, but
they didn't find the other one

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.590 align:middle line:90%
till 1949.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.440 align:middle line:84%
But they-- scientists
are pretty smart,

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.070 align:middle line:84%
so they started
reconnoitering the area

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and trying to determine
what could be--

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.370 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't have the ability
at that time to get in the air,

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.420 align:middle line:90%
to see it from the air.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.930 align:middle line:84%
But they were smart
enough to figure,

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:36.360 align:middle line:84%
that debris field has
to be from this craft.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And when they finally got
the craft to Los Alamos

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:84%
or wherever they
took it first, then

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:48.990 align:middle line:84%
they pieced together this debris
field at this tail section.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we thought it
was some sort of an antenna,

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.890 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know after all these
years if that was an antenna

00:20:55.890 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:84%
or if it was something else that
was some kind of a stabilizer

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.170 align:middle line:90%
system on the craft.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about a
lot of different things

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.180 align:middle line:84%
that he observed and
what he determined.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.540 align:middle line:84%
But one of the puzzles
was, what's it made of?

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.230 align:middle line:90%
How can we make this?

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
he did for a number of years

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.970 align:middle line:84%
after this, because he worked
for the government for a number

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:25.320 align:middle line:84%
of years, he said, we wanted
to know what this material was

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:30.420 align:middle line:84%
and what we could substitute
to make the same thing.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.220 align:middle line:90%
We might not be able to have--

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.670 align:middle line:84%
make this material because
it's from another planet

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.850 align:middle line:84%
or a substance of materials
that we don't have here,

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:42.210 align:middle line:84%
but what can we substitute
make the same thing?

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:45.270 align:middle line:84%
He said, and for years,
that's what I worked on.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what
experiments did he go on it?

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Did he tell you?

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.762 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: He didn't-- he
didn't go into that.

00:21:49.762 --> 00:21:51.368 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:21:51.368 --> 00:21:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And whatever happened
to that debris?

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:54.300 align:middle line:90%
Did he get to keep it?

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think the Institute
was able to obtain it.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
about that part of it.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm just guessing.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did the
Institute do with the metal?

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I was never
privy to that.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:06.770 align:middle line:84%
My job was to go
out to the field

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:08.600 align:middle line:84%
and get the stuff
and-- or obtain

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:13.020 align:middle line:84%
it or research it and come
back and tell the scientists.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And then some other
people would then

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:84%
make contact with
these other people--

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.725 align:middle line:90%
other retired scientists.

00:22:18.725 --> 00:22:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there anything
you can add to it?

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you did
handle this yourself.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.002 align:middle line:90%
Did you test it before you--

00:22:26.002 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:84%
you know, make sure
it wasn't radioactive

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:28.670 align:middle line:90%
before you grabbed it?

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Or he just opened the box
and he handed it to you?

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.450 align:middle line:90%
Did you notice anything else?

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: No.

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I thought about the fact that
maybe this was radioactive,

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:42.800 align:middle line:84%
but this guy is 95 years old
and he's had it all these years,

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.220 align:middle line:90%
and he's still walking around.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:44.390 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Maybe it gave
him more longevity.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Maybe it did--

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.910 align:middle line:84%
maybe it was like
cocoon, you know?

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.090 align:middle line:90%
But you know, I met--

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:54.480 align:middle line:84%
I played with it
as much as I could.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And what I was trying to do is
tear it, and it wouldn't rip.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- I mean,
it was flexible.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:04.070 align:middle line:84%
I was trying-- I mean, I'm not
a weight lifter or anything.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:05.120 align:middle line:90%
I was trying to--

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.950 align:middle line:90%
and I had a knife on me.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:08.420 align:middle line:90%
I always carry a pocket knife.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to
put a hole in it.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.180 align:middle line:90%
It was impossible to do.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was just an
amazing substance

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:90%
that you could wrinkle--

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.300 align:middle line:84%
and it took some
strength to do that.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.010 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like aluminum foil.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.990 align:middle line:84%
It was thicker
than aluminum foil.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.330 align:middle line:90%
This stuff is probably--

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.790 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't measure
it-- but probably an inch

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:28.850 align:middle line:90%
and a half thick.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And he had a 15
or 16-inch piece of it.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.500 align:middle line:90%
And it was all one piece.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.830 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't as if it was torn off.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And it took me some time
to get it into a ball.

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking-- and then
there was less resistance.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.080 align:middle line:84%
That's what really puzzled
me, because then you think,

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.530 align:middle line:90%
oh, I got it into a ball.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Then I put it down and it pops
back into its original shape.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You said it
had an original shape,

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.820 align:middle line:84%
so it wasn't like
a chunk or a torn,

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:84%
you know, shattered
piece of the craft.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:02.950 align:middle line:84%
This had-- was it
a rectangle, or--

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, it was
a long rectangle.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:05.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:06.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it was.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:07.120 align:middle line:90%
It had--

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Edges?

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It had clear edges.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:12.190 align:middle line:90%
Clear-cut edges to it.

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:16.120 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like it might
have been peeled off.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Maybe a tile.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Exactly.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.520 align:middle line:90%
Some sort of a tile.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I didn't ask him
that, but the scientists later,

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:27.430 align:middle line:84%
I remember one of them said
exactly what you said, is,

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:30.730 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if this is part of
a tile system or something?

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And how would it--
how does it stick?

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:34.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, there was a lot
of questions about that.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.135 align:middle line:90%
But it was just a piece.

00:24:37.135 --> 00:24:39.190 align:middle line:90%
It was not torn.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:40.870 align:middle line:90%
Didn't appear to be torn off.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:42.970 align:middle line:90%
The edges were smooth.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And almost-- I'm always
thinking it was cut off,

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.205 align:middle line:84%
but you know, the
more I think now,

00:24:48.205 --> 00:24:49.330 align:middle line:90%
it probably was peeled off.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:53.590 align:middle line:84%
It maybe was tile on the
antenna or something.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, working with Hal
and working with the Institute,

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:02.950 align:middle line:84%
what was the most mind-blowing
thing that you experienced

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:04.690 align:middle line:90%
or learned about?

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, [LAUGHS] there
were a couple of things,

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.670 align:middle line:84%
and only one that
I could actually

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:14.050 align:middle line:84%
talk about, because the others
would be somewhat proprietary.

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:18.190 align:middle line:84%
But I did have an occasion
to go to Switzerland, CERN,

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:21.190 align:middle line:90%
and observe the supercollider.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:24.070 align:middle line:84%
I was there was
other scientists.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:28.180 align:middle line:90%
And we were-- we toured it.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And they were actually going to
do a test while we were there.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not a physicist,
so I'm not really sure,

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.810 align:middle line:84%
but there were going
to collide or shoot

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:43.420 align:middle line:84%
something, some particular
element into another element.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And while-- and they anticipated
what was going to happen.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.940 align:middle line:84%
They said, OK, we're going
to probably get these three

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.570 align:middle line:90%
particles that are coming out.

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And they went into details which
I didn't really understand.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.650 align:middle line:90%
So we were at a viewing place.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And when they did
it, these scientists

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:08.060 align:middle line:84%
were yelling and
screaming success.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what we're talking--

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.440 align:middle line:84%
the guy-- the
scientist I was with--

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.090 align:middle line:90%
I can't mention his name--

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:16.340 align:middle line:90%
but he said, oh my god.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.140 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, what happened?

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.670 align:middle line:90%
What did they do?

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:24.620 align:middle line:84%
He said, rather than four
particles that came out,

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.020 align:middle line:90%
we got 10 particles.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:32.180 align:middle line:84%
We just discovered
six more particles

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.250 align:middle line:90%
that are within an atom.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was in 2000, I
believe, or sometime in there.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.330 align:middle line:84%
If you go to CERN and the
supercollider website,

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:84%
you find that now, today, 2021,
they have 59, because I just

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:51.790 align:middle line:90%
checked this morning.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:53.470 align:middle line:90%
I was going to bring this up.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And I checked this
morning, and they

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:59.600 align:middle line:84%
had-- they went from 10 or 12
that they knew then up to 59

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.400 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.495 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Brilliant.

00:27:01.495 --> 00:27:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It's brilliant.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And although I'm not a
physicist or a chemist,

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:10.930 align:middle line:84%
just to be there
and witnessing this

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.510 align:middle line:90%
was an amazing opportunity.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And to feel
all the energy and where

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.790 align:middle line:90%
that went from then till now.

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Exactly.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:20.190 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You're part of history.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And I
also suspect, Rick,

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.690 align:middle line:84%
that there's amazing things that
have happened that you probably
