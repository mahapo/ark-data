00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with Tim who is speaking

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.880 align:middle line:10%
with us today from Germany.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.110 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a Tactical Advisor in
the covert government in Germany

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.730 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes, anticipates, and
suggests various strategies

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:10%
connected to the
extraterrestrial groups

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.150 align:middle line:10%
in contact with Earth.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.630 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Emery.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm really happy to talk to you.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I'm really excited
about today's agenda,

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.930 align:middle line:84%
especially because we're
talking about psionics

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.790 align:middle line:90%
and the consciousness of Earth.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:90%
So Tim, what are psionics?

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And why is it important
for the agenda for contact?

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Psionics is one of
the main reasons

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.580 align:middle line:84%
why we will have
a full disclosure

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:90%
right in this very moment.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Because psionics is the
ability to alter your reality.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And the science
behind this is that we

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.460 align:middle line:84%
are all one consciousness field
that is experiencing itself.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.870 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, the living
field that we all are

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.750 align:middle line:84%
and that we see ourselves living
in is what is creating reality.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And once a person or a species
has access to this ability,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle line:84%
it can alter its own
reality beyond measure.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.940 align:middle line:84%
So what is important to see
is that this kind of waveform

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.490 align:middle line:84%
can be integrated
into technology.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.880 align:middle line:84%
So if we have a certain higher
and lower altitude waveform,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.450 align:middle line:84%
we can bring that into
a machine, a computer,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.300 align:middle line:84%
or whatever that can be
used to alter reality.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.670 align:middle line:84%
But the examination and
analysis of the universe

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.960 align:middle line:84%
shows that those life forms
that have the ability and minds

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.660 align:middle line:84%
to alter their reality, this
is beyond everything technology

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.710 align:middle line:90%
could do.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And to have the perfect,
the highest efficiency,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84%
you need to have a collective
goal that a species is

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.370 align:middle line:90%
trying to bring into reality.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the reasons
why disclosure is heavily

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:43.380 align:middle line:84%
connected with the emerging
status of humanity to evolve

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.100 align:middle line:90%
into psionic beings.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So to your knowledge is
psionics being used on humans

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.540 align:middle line:90%
by humans, number one?

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And number two, are
psionics being used

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.580 align:middle line:90%
by extraterrestrials on humans?

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>> What has been installed
around this planet is something

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.450 align:middle line:84%
that is a self-sufficient
system of psionics.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.990 align:middle line:84%
What is set up is a
installation on humanity

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:90%
that deals with angst.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And this has something
to do with hindering

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.980 align:middle line:84%
the process of humanity
coming into full potential.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.550 align:middle line:90%
So once the humans--

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.280 align:middle line:84%
more and more
individuals need to think

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.950 align:middle line:90%
about psionic abilities.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.430 align:middle line:84%
They need to
practice meditation.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.940 align:middle line:84%
They need to realize that they
are this living experience that

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:90%
is experiencing itself.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Once this is done, we can
reach a critical mass.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And when this mass has been
overcome, then the occurrence,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.460 align:middle line:84%
the randomly occurring effects
of psionics within this species

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.480 align:middle line:84%
is high enough to be a
psionic species itself.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So humans can become, and will
become soon, a psionic species.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:10%
And then the effect that
the tactical advantages

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.850 align:middle line:10%
that certain other species have
concerning psionics and mind

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:24.150 align:middle line:10%
control, for example, this
can be defensed against.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Who put this barrier,
this psionic wave barrier,

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.130 align:middle line:90%
across our planet?

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>> That again is a
dangerous question, Emery.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want to
interfere with militaries--

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>> We both know psionics does
have a negative kind of thought

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.170 align:middle line:84%
process with humans, but
also could be used for good.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.970 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>> It is used.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sure.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:10%
>> --could you
please explain that?

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Mind powers or
psionics, so to speak,

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:84%
can be used to heal somebody, to
get into contact with somebody

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.710 align:middle line:84%
who is outside of
the shared dimension.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.410 align:middle line:84%
So there are thousands and
thousands of beneficial aspects

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.290 align:middle line:90%
to this psionic topic.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And for example, in the
level three experience

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:23.310 align:middle line:84%
which is mostly about dividing
and having a sense of this

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.450 align:middle line:84%
is you, this we,
this is me, there

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.830 align:middle line:84%
are some restrictive
barriers so to speak.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Artificial barriers
that people tend

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.920 align:middle line:84%
to install themselves just
to have more power themselves

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.940 align:middle line:90%
over others.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.720 align:middle line:84%
For example, just as easy
as you can think about it.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.240 align:middle line:84%
It's just, for example,
access to technology

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.260 align:middle line:84%
that could fly you to
another space system.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.830 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
is restricted access.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you're
thinking of psionics,

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.310 align:middle line:84%
the universe gives
you an opportunity

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.230 align:middle line:84%
to overcome this kind of
restricting barrier yourself.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Because once you can open
certain natural portals,

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:21.540 align:middle line:84%
you can then be free, free life
form and go wherever you want,

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and integrate this
into your reality.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So can a third density
human being get to that level

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.830 align:middle line:84%
of psionics and consciousness
and utilize that or do they

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.720 align:middle line:90%
have to be fourth density?

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well every being in the
universe can get to any point

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.950 align:middle line:84%
of frequency ad hoc in
every second possible,

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:54.810 align:middle line:84%
because the necessity to this is
that they realize that they are

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.100 align:middle line:84%
this field of
intelligent nothingness.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:04.680 align:middle line:84%
When they dive into this,
they can alter their reality

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.890 align:middle line:90%
to any kind of frequency.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:14.490 align:middle line:84%
But when people are experiencing
a level three consciousness,

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.870 align:middle line:84%
they tend to not do so because
they have a very strong mindset

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:84%
of this is linear physics,
this could not happen,

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.450 align:middle line:84%
thought transmission is not
possible, and so on, and so on.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.460 align:middle line:10%
And when we are
talking frequencies,

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.080 align:middle line:10%
then you can see that there
are a lot of subtones.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So a human being that has
a level three consciousness

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:84%
could, for example,
experience something

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.800 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, I'm thinking
of my grandma.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And in this situation, this
second, the telephone rings.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:08:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So once they got some awareness
to this kind of synchronicity,

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.860 align:middle line:84%
they can move on into
a level four being.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And level 4 means that
you have a lot of training

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of experience saying
to do to even get higher.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:19.920 align:middle line:84%
So coming to your question,
yes, a level three being

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:25.710 align:middle line:84%
can use psionics, but tends
not to do so because they

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.310 align:middle line:90%
don't believe in it.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So Tim, what have you
achieved in that way?

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.419 align:middle line:84%
>> I wouldn't say this is an
achievement because it sounds

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:38.460 align:middle line:84%
kind of special, but every
one and every life form has--

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.750 align:middle line:90%
this is open source.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.419 align:middle line:84%
The universe in
itself is open source.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:48.510 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I've found
really helpful in communicating

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:54.390 align:middle line:84%
with people is to
sense their feelings,

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:58.380 align:middle line:84%
sense their perspective
in order to bring peace

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.260 align:middle line:90%
to the overall communication.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.950 align:middle line:90%
This is something.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is that
at some point when you

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.460 align:middle line:90%
concentrate on it, you can--

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.090 align:middle line:84%
and with some training or a
lot of training, I don't know,

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.470 align:middle line:84%
you can achieve understanding
of temporal dynamics

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:21.480 align:middle line:84%
which then means you
can understand events

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.770 align:middle line:84%
in the horizon of possibilities
and probabilities,

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.100 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
head towards them.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.100 align:middle line:84%
But actually everything
you can think of,

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Emery, is something
that can be done.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>> There's nothing impossible.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're everywhere
all the time.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's talk about the
difference between frequential

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.020 align:middle line:90%
harmonics and psionics.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So frequential harmonics,
which should not be confused

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.260 align:middle line:90%
with dimensions.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So people often are talking
about interdimensional beings.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:02.190 align:middle line:84%
At some point of our
evolution, a space component

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.260 align:middle line:90%
is not necessary anymore.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:90%
Time is not necessary anymore.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:84%
So when we're talking about
frequential harmonics,

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.860 align:middle line:84%
this is a concept
of the universe.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And when I began working
on those subjects,

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:23.130 align:middle line:84%
we had seven or eight
frequential harmonics.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And we're in
constant evolvement.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So now we're heading
up to 12 of them.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.990 align:middle line:84%
So those frequential
harmonics are defined in a way

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.770 align:middle line:84%
that it's the specific
tone of ourself

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.490 align:middle line:84%
that you radiate
into the surrounding.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:46.230 align:middle line:84%
So all concepts are wrong, but
some are useful so to speak.

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:52.920 align:middle line:84%
We are living inside of a
kind of net of being thing.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And we are radiating our
frequency into this being.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And this being gives
information about this frequency

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.070 align:middle line:90%
back to ourselves.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.780 align:middle line:90%
And this defines our reality.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:14.550 align:middle line:84%
So when Earth people tended to
be in a level three harmonic,

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:18.960 align:middle line:84%
that means they have linear
physics and a dualistic way

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.170 align:middle line:90%
of thinking.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:25.230 align:middle line:84%
While we're now heading
into a higher frequency

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:30.600 align:middle line:84%
field in the universe, we're
now approaching a perfect four

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:35.640 align:middle line:84%
harmonic, which means that
this planet soon will become

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.570 align:middle line:90%
a fully level four planet.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.760 align:middle line:90%
Which means anything can happen.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.200 align:middle line:84%
It means there will be
technology that can heal

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.230 align:middle line:90%
our bodies to every extent.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.620 align:middle line:84%
That we can, for
example, move barriers.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.220 align:middle line:84%
We can integrate
this into technology.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.310 align:middle line:84%
When we're thinking
of harmonics,

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:04.300 align:middle line:84%
we're thinking of experiences
and consciousness level.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:13.110 align:middle line:10%
And the more experienced a being
is, the more ways of living

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.380 align:middle line:10%
can be obtained.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.210 align:middle line:84%
So a being that has reached
level five consciousness

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:22.470 align:middle line:84%
or frequential harmonics,
it can live without a body,

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:23.640 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And if we're even
thinking higher to this,

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:32.100 align:middle line:84%
then the overall structure of
the universe is a being, too.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>> What level of consciousness
does humanity have to obtain

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.420 align:middle line:84%
in order for us to
have more open contact?

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>> On a professional basic
thinking about what needs to be

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.510 align:middle line:84%
done to have an
open contact world,

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:54.690 align:middle line:84%
there are more specifications
to what needs to be avoided

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.940 align:middle line:90%
to have an open contact.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So one thing that we need to
avoid is a global psychosis.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
really needs to be avoided,

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:10.350 align:middle line:84%
because people can get scared
if they have an open contact.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:14.640 align:middle line:10%
And if their reality
breaks too easily,

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.450 align:middle line:10%
then they can get into
this psychosis mindset,

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.570 align:middle line:10%
which means, like, they
tend to react to this.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And if this happens on a global
scale, then this would be,

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.950 align:middle line:84%
probably, the worst case
scenario to the earth.

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Catastrophic
to say the least.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So quantum explosions
could occur.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:90%
Everything could start anew.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
we want to avoid.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:47.520 align:middle line:84%
B, what we want to avoid
is a mindset where it gets

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:53.220 align:middle line:84%
incoordinated, which means
that bodies of the global

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.520 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, for
example institutions,

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.720 align:middle line:90%
cannot agree on certain things.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.150 align:middle line:90%
So they block each other.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.600 align:middle line:84%
This is something we
definitely need to avoid.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.620 align:middle line:90%
We need to gain trust.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And we need to move
forward in one direction.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.970 align:middle line:84%
The third thing we
need to avoid when

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.860 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
the mindset is

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:18.810 align:middle line:84%
a accusing mindset, because
there have been decisions

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:25.680 align:middle line:84%
in the past which are related
to human characters that

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.910 align:middle line:84%
have been sad, least
to say, and terrible.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And however we deal
with this, this

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.510 align:middle line:84%
is something we need to
figure out collectively.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:40.740 align:middle line:84%
But we should not tend
to be too accusing,

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.820 align:middle line:84%
because it's still ourselves
in a cosmic way we're

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.090 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So the universe
does make mistakes.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth thing
we need to avoid

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:57.840 align:middle line:84%
is xenophobia which means a
way of racism or speciesism

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.750 align:middle line:90%
to intergalactic families.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:03.390 align:middle line:10%
And to put this
positively, I would

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:09.330 align:middle line:10%
wish people to get interactive
with the process of Earth shift

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:10.890 align:middle line:10%
as much as possible.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Explain to the audience
this Earth shift you keep

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.540 align:middle line:90%
mentioning.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Earth shift is
that the reality we were used

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.170 align:middle line:84%
to experiencing
for a long, long,

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:29.230 align:middle line:84%
long time is somehow
overdue, so to speak.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:33.870 align:middle line:84%
There are parts of this global
civilization that already

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:90%
deals with something we would--

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.460 align:middle line:84%
or the people on the
street, so to speak--

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.840 align:middle line:90%
would see this as futuristic.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So there already is a kind of
reality and a kind of shift.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And the necessity that
we now have to deal with

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:84%
is bringing this
back to everybody

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.570 align:middle line:90%
and to make the global shift.

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is coming, and it must
come as happily as possible.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.447 align:middle line:84%
From your experience
and exposure,

00:16:07.447 --> 00:16:11.460 align:middle line:84%
what will open contact be
like and who will it be with?

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.960 align:middle line:10%
>> This is an
interesting question,

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.580 align:middle line:10%
because we're right now at this
very moment heading towards

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.660 align:middle line:10%
open contact, even more
and more every day.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.870 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
plans and preparations

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.920 align:middle line:90%
that are now being executed.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:35.320 align:middle line:10%
For example, that we have
sent Perseverance to Mars.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:40.230 align:middle line:84%
So we get the first
real-time images from Mars.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And the first time
you can see a blue sky

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.660 align:middle line:90%
which isn't a filter anymore.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's not the
red planet anymore.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.990 align:middle line:90%
We can see blue sky.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:53.610 align:middle line:84%
German NASA, so to
speak, released images

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:57.690 align:middle line:84%
where they showed
constructions on Mars.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.550 align:middle line:90%
They are online.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:01.710 align:middle line:84%
They even had an
article online where

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:06.730 align:middle line:84%
they were talking publicly
about ancient life on Mars.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So in the mainstream media,
somebody told the audience

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.200 align:middle line:84%
that there is
ancient life on Mars.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.119 align:middle line:84%
So this is not the only thing
that's happening right now,

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:21.750 align:middle line:84%
because there are lots
of preparations going on,

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:25.060 align:middle line:84%
and we can have
various scenarios.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we're trying
to have and to bring forward.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.750 align:middle line:84%
There are some ET
races that would

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:36.910 align:middle line:90%
like to play a role in this.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And so much as a householder
not always wants somebody

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.710 align:middle line:84%
to ring on the
door, so humans tend

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:50.560 align:middle line:84%
to be overprotective
with the narrative.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So what we can see is that
mostly humanoid or similar

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle line:84%
species have the
best rating when

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:05.520 align:middle line:84%
it comes to the reaction a
human has to a non terrestrial.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And the next best rating would
be a furry kind of ET species.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.870 align:middle line:84%
So these are the species
that show the best results.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's not absolutely
100% sure what kind

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.120 align:middle line:84%
of open contact
scenario we will have,

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.930 align:middle line:84%
because there are several
that got played out.

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:10%
And when the
frequency of the earth

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.510 align:middle line:10%
is at the right
specification parameter

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:38.190 align:middle line:10%
then we have the matching
solution to this.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Will this open contact be
limited to the military or will

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.110 align:middle line:90%
everyone be a part of it?

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:49.800 align:middle line:10%
>> So the characteristics of
human beings show that they are

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.290 align:middle line:10%
pretty overprotective.

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And they tend to set up special
access to certain things.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So it is most likely that,
especially in the beginning,

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:07.080 align:middle line:84%
this will be a heavily
guided scenario.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And I assume you have
some experience in this.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.010 align:middle line:84%
There's always some
kind of possibility

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:18.640 align:middle line:84%
to make open contact, close
encounter to some species.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.730 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on the level
of personal avoidance

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:30.040 align:middle line:84%
or willingness to make contact
if your life will show contact

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.400 align:middle line:90%
in the next years or not.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.695 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning,
I assume that it

00:19:34.695 --> 00:19:38.700 align:middle line:84%
will be a lot more
conservative at the beginning

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.520 align:middle line:84%
in the next three to
five years, while I

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.830 align:middle line:84%
would suggest that the
open contact scenario will

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.810 align:middle line:90%
be within this year.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think a lot of people
are going to freak out once

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.080 align:middle line:90%
this open contact does happen?

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a fear, because there
hasn't been too much effort

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:05.620 align:middle line:84%
in preparing people over
the last 40-50 years,

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:90%
which could have been done so.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.320 align:middle line:84%
But we're seeing
right now that there

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:17.440 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of preparations being
done to guide people in a way.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And so what we
have is something,

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.460 align:middle line:84%
it's called trait
angst or trait anxiety,

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:28.890 align:middle line:84%
which means that there
are certain groups

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.280 align:middle line:84%
of the civilization, of
human civilization, that

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:39.570 align:middle line:84%
tends to have more probability
to be afraid or fearful.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And as being said,
the most efficient way

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:48.880 align:middle line:84%
to set up a scenario is a
self-sufficient scenario.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.260 align:middle line:84%
So there might be
created something

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:56.340 align:middle line:84%
to separate those
groups that tend

00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:02.610 align:middle line:84%
to show fear and angst, where
those who are pretty much

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:07.470 align:middle line:84%
prepared for open contact,
just as everybody watching this

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:12.690 align:middle line:84%
as the target group, they
get straight information

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.560 align:middle line:84%
from whoever is on "Cosmic
Disclosure," for example.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Bravo.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.100 align:middle line:10%
Tim, through your
contacts and experiences,

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.680 align:middle line:10%
do you know of any
ancient philosophy

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.580 align:middle line:10%
that best describes the
history of humanity?

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.500 align:middle line:10%
>> That's a beautiful
question, Emery.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Because to my own
observation, a lot

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.990 align:middle line:84%
of what has been told
in India, for example,

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:42.150 align:middle line:84%
is something that is
very close to what

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.750 align:middle line:84%
is happening and describes
it in a various way.

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But people need to understand
what this is all about.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Because, for example,
Sanskrit which

00:21:54.810 --> 00:22:00.420 align:middle line:84%
is the language of
ancient yogic times

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:09.630 align:middle line:84%
is one of the only surviving
languages that resembles the--

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:14.010 align:middle line:84%
or comes very close
to the [GERMAN]..

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:17.280 align:middle line:84%
It comes close to
source in a way.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of pictures
we find there

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:25.770 align:middle line:84%
has a lot to do with
what's happening right now.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:29.280 align:middle line:84%
For example, the one thing
I found really interesting

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.900 align:middle line:84%
when we're talking
about psionics

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:35.070 align:middle line:84%
is that Brahma,
who is the creator

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:39.090 align:middle line:90%
or the self in some way.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:44.310 align:middle line:84%
He does not wear any kind of
weapon, but he wears a spoon.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking about
psionics and, for example Uri

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Geller, or something, and we
imagine psionics and a spoon,

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.800 align:middle line:84%
this is something people,
like 12,000 years ago,

00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:00.060 align:middle line:84%
have already brought
into their philosophy.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And there are
examples to what is

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.350 align:middle line:90%
happening all over the place.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.390 align:middle line:90%
It just needs to be understood.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So having an
elevated consciousness,

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:15.270 align:middle line:84%
there's been many channelers
out there and others who claim

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:20.220 align:middle line:84%
to have been in contact
with extraterrestrial races.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:24.760 align:middle line:84%
How does psionics fit into that,
and what did you experience?

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:32.290 align:middle line:10%
>> So when we're talking about
a shared kind of universe

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:38.200 align:middle line:10%
or a shared kind of experience,
then something that is really

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:44.860 align:middle line:10%
important is that it's logical
and shared by many people.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.360 align:middle line:90%
Then it becomes a reality.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So if one person
experienced something

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and it's totally
out of hand, that

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:56.740 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that
this is not truth.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:03.880 align:middle line:84%
It just means that something
absurd or not normal

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.730 align:middle line:90%
has happened to this one person.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:10.780 align:middle line:84%
But mostly like
if lots of people

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.990 align:middle line:84%
share the same
experience, then it

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:18.940 align:middle line:84%
gets integrated into the same
collectively shared timeline.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>> You've mentioned
timelines before.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Can you go a little
bit more into that

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.840 align:middle line:90%
and how they may even overlap?

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.980 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So again, all concepts are
wrong, but some are useful.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:37.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine
one kind of vector

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.660 align:middle line:84%
in time and space,
a straight line that

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.080 align:middle line:84%
has no end and no
beginning, then

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:84%
from a 3D perspective
of this, a timeline

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:53.630 align:middle line:84%
has kind of a tree-like
fractalized body,

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:58.990 align:middle line:84%
which is moving around
at every single second.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And this changes from what
perspective we have on it.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.940 align:middle line:84%
If we have a 2D
perspective on timelines,

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:10.840 align:middle line:84%
then we sort of
see only one point

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.300 align:middle line:90%
that everything is connected to.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.330 align:middle line:90%
And this is the shared timeline.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:20.590 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
that there aren't

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:23.140 align:middle line:90%
a lot of other timelines.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:30.850 align:middle line:84%
But this is one timeline that is
shared by a lot of life forms.

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And those decisions that those
life forms make alter the way

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:39.550 align:middle line:84%
the tree-like structure
around this vector

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:42.940 align:middle line:84%
is moving around
like a kaleidoscope.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when we are
talking about timelines,

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:52.750 align:middle line:84%
there are collapsing timelines,
which means that a kind

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:58.600 align:middle line:84%
of journey has come to an end
because the self cannot provide

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.210 align:middle line:90%
a solution to this timeline.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:05.530 align:middle line:84%
That is the moment when a
timeline collapses and gets

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:11.740 align:middle line:84%
reintegrated into this vector
so that basically the universe

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:16.150 align:middle line:84%
assures that everybody
will certainly

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:21.760 align:middle line:84%
have his or her safe
timeline to go on.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Even if one doesn't
work anymore,

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:28.150 align:middle line:84%
it gets reintegrated
into the vector

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:29.920 align:middle line:90%
that connects everything.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned
shared timelines.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And how does that fit
in interdimensionally?

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So interdimensionally
or interfrequentially?

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Either one.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a difference.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So when we're talking
about dimensions,

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:47.440 align:middle line:84%
we are always talking
about shared space.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:54.800 align:middle line:84%
A time can be in some kind
of physics a shared space.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.740 align:middle line:84%
So you and I are
sharing a timeline now.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.560 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking about
interfrequential harmonics,

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.790 align:middle line:84%
it's not necessary anymore
because at level four

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, we realize
that we can go forward

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:13.000 align:middle line:84%
and backward in time
at any time we want,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.910 align:middle line:84%
because we are
time, so to speak.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:22.030 align:middle line:84%
So this makes a
timeline more flexible.

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:25.240 align:middle line:84%
This vector we're talking
about in the fourth level

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:30.310 align:middle line:84%
is not only a string, but it's
moving in any kind of direction

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:31.660 align:middle line:90%
like a compass.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned timelines
and how they're shared.

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Will it affect open
disclosure, number one?

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:40.880 align:middle line:90%
And can it get derailed by that?

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And if so, who would be
responsible for that?

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's a necessity to
what is happening right now.

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:52.990 align:middle line:84%
The evolution of the
universe is going onward.

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And everyone who
willingly expresses

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.860 align:middle line:84%
to be on this kind
of timeline will

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:04.060 align:middle line:84%
stay on this kind of timeline,
because they are also

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.590 align:middle line:90%
creating this.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And the universe
will fit their life

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:15.280 align:middle line:84%
into this string of
timeline that will succeed.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:22.450 align:middle line:84%
So we have a 100% guarantee
that the overall evolution

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:26.570 align:middle line:84%
of the universe will
succeed, which is great.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:31.070 align:middle line:84%
But the amount of time
that is necessary,

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:35.960 align:middle line:84%
or the structure of this
fractal, tree-like structure

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:40.220 align:middle line:84%
around this perfect
timeline can be altered.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And this certainly can
collapse some timelines

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:51.530 align:middle line:84%
if they are not striving
towards the specific goal.

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:56.420 align:middle line:84%
But again there is something
about the more collapsing

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.840 align:middle line:84%
timelines the
universe experiences,

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:04.280 align:middle line:84%
the more it learns how not
to collapse that timeline,

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.330 align:middle line:90%
if this makes sense to you.

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So the universe certainly
has a 100% guarantee

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.810 align:middle line:90%
that this all is happening.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:18.500 align:middle line:84%
The earth will shift
into a different reality.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.630 align:middle line:84%
That those beings
who are willingly

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:23.390 align:middle line:84%
expressing that they are
on the right timeline,

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:26.990 align:middle line:84%
they are on the right
timeline, to be assured.

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:31.760 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean that
certain random or initiated

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.830 align:middle line:90%
events couldn't happen.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Tim, that was brilliant.

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:37.660 align:middle line:90%
