[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.395 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:17.770 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: All right,
welcome to Cosmic Disclosure.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.900 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David
Wilcock, and in this episode,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.090 align:middle line:10%
we have a true special surprise
for you, one of the original

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.420 align:middle line:10%
and probably the heaviest of
the original Disclosure Project

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.740 align:middle line:10%
lineup from 1997, the
most intense insider

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:10%
in that original
meeting, David Adair.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.141 align:middle line:90%
So David, welcome to the show.

00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:38.181 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID ADAIR: Thank you.

00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:39.020 align:middle line:90%
Glad to be here.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Tell us a little bit
about where were you born,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and what were some of your
early childhood experiences

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.502 align:middle line:84%
that brought you into
this bizarre arena.

00:00:48.502 --> 00:00:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: [LAUGHS]
That's well-phrased.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.050 align:middle line:10%
I was born in Welch, West
Virginia in Number 10

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle line:10%
Pocahontas Coalfields.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.149 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like Hunger
Games, you've

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:00.190 align:middle line:90%
got a different district.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.200 align:middle line:90%
That was the Number 10 district.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:10%
And being relative, about three
miles from where I was born

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.350 align:middle line:10%
is Coalwood, and that's where
Homer Hickam of October Sky

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.670 align:middle line:10%
was born.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And he and I both agree there
must have been something

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.850 align:middle line:90%
in the water in that place.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.780 align:middle line:84%
But when-- I knew there was
something different about me.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.960 align:middle line:90%
My mother told me a story.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.450 align:middle line:84%
She said I was only one and
one and a half years old,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.940 align:middle line:84%
and I was playing with
a toy, and, of course,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:90%
it's a model rocket.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.530 align:middle line:84%
But it got caught between the
refrigerator and the wall.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't do
anything, just watched me.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.680 align:middle line:84%
I was looking around, found
a broom, could barely walk.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.480 align:middle line:90%
Get it over there.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Sweep the rocket out,
pick it up, and take off.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And my mother said to
my dad, Fred, "Fred,

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:84%
there's something not
normal about that child.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, he's already
got tools in recognition.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.900 align:middle line:90%
He's only one and 1/2."

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So by the
time I was seven,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.960 align:middle line:84%
I would go to the local
library, and boy, that's

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.970 align:middle line:90%
when it started.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:84%
I started reading books in
the 600 area, the science,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.540 align:middle line:84%
really hard science,
and then mathematics.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.377 align:middle line:84%
And this elderly librarian named
Mrs. Hunt, she was watching me

00:02:18.377 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:84%
and said, are you
reading those books?

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't mean to be smart.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.420 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, there's
no pictures in them.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And she looks at
it, and she goes,

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's see what you know.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.120 align:middle line:84%
So she grabs a
book, just a random.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.390 align:middle line:84%
I think it was one on
singularities with black holes,

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.160 align:middle line:84%
and it's just really
basic theorems,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:84%
because around 1962,
'63, there wasn't

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.000 align:middle line:90%
a whole lot on the subject.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: But you
know, I read up on it,

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and I started explaining to
her exactly how in detail it

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.010 align:middle line:84%
works with the mass star
collapsing and graviton fields,

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.774 align:middle line:90%
event horizon, the opening.

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:55.565 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of
drawing pictures for her,

00:02:55.565 --> 00:02:57.340 align:middle line:90%
and she's watching me.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And she said, man, you
really do read this stuff.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.407 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:03:01.407 --> 00:03:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, how many of these
books have you read?

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:90%
I said, all of them.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, why are
you reading them now?

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm going through
them and correcting

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.230 align:middle line:90%
mistakes in the books.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And she just kind
of stared at me,

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't tell whether
she believed me or not or just

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.090 align:middle line:90%
thought I was being smart.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.044 align:middle line:90%
But she said, tell you what.

00:03:21.044 --> 00:03:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to
get other books?

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.390 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh, god.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:90%
How can I?

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.115 align:middle line:84%
Don't tell anyone, and I'll
use resources and order them

00:03:28.115 --> 00:03:29.860 align:middle line:84%
for you, and she'd
get stacks of them.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And from
other books, there'd

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.950 align:middle line:90%
be references to other books.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I
built my list, and I

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.100 align:middle line:84%
must have read about, oh, god,
1,800 books in a few years.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And that was a real basis
to work from at that point.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What ignited your
passion the most in these 1800

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.470 align:middle line:90%
books or so that you read?

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Space travel,
pretty much so.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Although I really
liked all sciences--

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.160 align:middle line:90%
Earth science.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.170 align:middle line:84%
I really liked Earth
science, but space travel

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.110 align:middle line:84%
and propulsion, where it could
go from then to maybe 100 years

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.910 align:middle line:90%
from now.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.450 align:middle line:90%


00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.890 align:middle line:84%
I just like reading what
people were trying to do

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.584 align:middle line:90%
or thinking of doing.

00:04:15.584 --> 00:04:17.459 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What was the
most surprising mistake

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.649 align:middle line:90%
that you found in the books?

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.149 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Their math.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.550 align:middle line:90%
The math was off.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.590 align:middle line:90%
I could tell right away.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.240 align:middle line:90%
And it was a good reason for it.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.490 align:middle line:90%
Nothing bad about the authors.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.560 align:middle line:84%
They were just going on
data that was coming off

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:84%
of satellites and probes
and other research material,

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.070 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't have
big computers then.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And I could rework the
math, extend it out,

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.497 align:middle line:90%
and find where the errors are.

00:04:45.497 --> 00:04:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And they really couldn't,
because they didn't have

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.840 align:middle line:90%
the support mechanism to do so.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:90%
I just could do it.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: How did you start
to apply this knowledge?

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you're not
just going to read books.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.250 align:middle line:84%
You're going to want to
do something with it, so

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:84%
how did you start to
apply the knowledge?

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: That's a good question.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a step that we
can do, scientific method.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.390 align:middle line:84%
You'll look at
theoretical stuff,

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and then you move on
to applied science.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: So what does
that mean in normal terms?

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.736 align:middle line:84%
It means that I was
studying propulsion,

00:05:15.736 --> 00:05:17.180 align:middle line:90%
so I started building rockets.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And I started off
by solid propellant,

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.800 align:middle line:84%
which I made my own
solid rocket fuel just

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.450 align:middle line:90%
like Homer Hickam did.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.190 align:middle line:84%
There were no-- the Estes kits
didn't come out until later.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: But they were just
too slow and too primitive.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean 4,000 years,
China with gunpowder.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.630 align:middle line:10%
And so I jumped to the cryogenic
fluids, liquid hydrogen,

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.390 align:middle line:10%
liquid oxygen. Then we got
some power out of that.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And cryogenic fluids with their
temperatures running around 325

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.440 align:middle line:90%
degrees Fahrenheit below zero--

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.615 align:middle line:84%
when you detonate something like
that, you get a lot of BTUs,

00:05:55.615 --> 00:05:56.850 align:middle line:90%
so you get thrust.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And now you can start working
on all kinds of math tables

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.250 align:middle line:90%
with that concept.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.960 align:middle line:84%
But it was all
leading to something,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:90%
and I wasn't even aware of it.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.850 align:middle line:84%
There are only two type
of rocket engines today--

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.360 align:middle line:90%
solid fuel and liquid fuel.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: We don't
use anything else.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, the big one that I built,
Pitholem, she was neither one.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.829 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: When you say
Pitholem, what's that?

00:06:20.829 --> 00:06:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Pitholem is
the name of my rocket.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.578 align:middle line:84%
I was working on it, and
I hadn't named it yet.

00:06:24.578 --> 00:06:26.300 align:middle line:90%
My mother came in.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.640 align:middle line:84%
"I just had a strange
dream with you."

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle line:84%
I went, oh, this ought to
be good, because she had

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.270 align:middle line:90%
some really interesting dreams.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.620 align:middle line:90%
And I said, so what's the dream?

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just working away
with my back to her,

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.270 align:middle line:90%
and I'm working on the bench.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:46.400 align:middle line:84%
She said, I saw these giant
bleachers out in the desert,

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.750 align:middle line:90%
you know, grandstands.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's a railway
tracks between them.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Big railroad locomotives,
several of them

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:58.290 align:middle line:84%
were pushing this giant rocket
laying sideways like a sled.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And it stopped, and
there was a gantry

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.510 align:middle line:90%
built way up to meet the door.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.926 align:middle line:84%
You opened the
doors, stepped out.

00:07:03.926 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:84%
She goes, you didn't
have any hair on top.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.260 align:middle line:90%
The hair on the side was white.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, that's about all
I heard for a few minutes.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.040 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any hair?

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.550 align:middle line:90%
That's not good.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:18.000 align:middle line:84%
However, she said, you addressed
everybody, thanked them

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.300 align:middle line:84%
for coming out, and said, let's
see this thing, you know--

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.110 align:middle line:90%
let's not talk.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:90%
Let's just do this.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.980 align:middle line:90%
So I get back in.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.770 align:middle line:84%
The locomotive's pushing
about a mile or two away

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:29.940 align:middle line:90%
from the stands.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Then they come back, and
then the thing just turns on.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.100 align:middle line:90%
The sled motors turn on.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.780 align:middle line:84%
It takes off across
the desert floor,

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
goes up the side of a
mountain, and then she said,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:84%
I guess the main engines
come on and just--

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.760 align:middle line:90%
you're a welder.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.877 align:middle line:90%
How bright is it?

00:07:45.877 --> 00:07:47.460 align:middle line:84%
She goes, it's way
brighter than that.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:90%
It was like the sun.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And she said,
we never saw you leaving.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.890 align:middle line:84%
We just had an explosion,
and it was gone.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.594 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing left
trailing in the vapors

00:07:55.594 --> 00:07:56.510 align:middle line:90%
was like your rainbow.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And I went, my
god, she described

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.790 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic fusion engine
in our atmosphere perfectly.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And my mom doesn't-- my
mom doesn't know that.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.670 align:middle line:90%
So I just-- that's interesting.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, oh,
one other thing.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.610 align:middle line:84%
There was a name painted
on the side of it.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:13.410 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.840 align:middle line:84%
She said, here, I
wrote it down for you.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.180 align:middle line:90%
I woke up spelling it.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.920 align:middle line:84%
P-I-T-H-O-L-E-M. It
looks like pithole,

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.990 align:middle line:84%
but with that M on
it becomes Pitholem.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.730 align:middle line:90%
So anyhow, that's Pitholem.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.850 align:middle line:90%
That's where it came from.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:32.799 align:middle line:90%
