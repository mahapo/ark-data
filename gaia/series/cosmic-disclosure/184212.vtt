00:00:19.745 --> 00:00:21.620 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.920 align:middle line:10%
we are here with Randy Cramer,
a covert military space program

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.680 align:middle line:10%
operative who is sharing
his experiences with us.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.860 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY CRAMER: Thank
you, very glad to be here.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now we all know about
ETs that have the five-star

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.110 align:middle line:84%
program of the head,
two arms, and two legs.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever experienced ETs
don't have two arms and two

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:90%
legs and a head?

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, insectoid species for
starters have more appendages,

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.870 align:middle line:90%
they have more arms.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.020 align:middle line:84%
I have encountered
a cephalopod which

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
is essentially like an octopus
in a diplomatic conversation.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So we're basically sitting
at a table on the other side

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.910 align:middle line:84%
of a tank filled with water
and they were floating around

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.447 align:middle line:84%
in the tank communicating
psionically.

00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: What was taking place?

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Why were you having
that meeting?

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Were there other
species there as well?

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Our ambassadorial
team was there and just--

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.960 align:middle line:84%
was just a negotiation
with the cephalopods.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.080 align:middle line:84%
It was some negotiation
for resources,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.420 align:middle line:90%
for an exchange of resources.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.572 align:middle line:84%
If I'm recalling correctly,
they needed some form of mineral

00:01:24.572 --> 00:01:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that was rare to
them that we could

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.810 align:middle line:84%
get them more inexpensively,
and they were essentially

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.110 align:middle line:84%
offering ocean protein at
a very inexpensive cost.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.560 align:middle line:84%
So it was a seafood
exchange for minerals that--

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Like plankton
or seaweed or--

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.267 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I think fish
to be honest with you.

00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:84%
I think mostly it was
like yeah, sea proteins.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Fish of some kind, some
kind of edible fish food.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tell me
about the insectoids.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Now I know there's
many species, but which

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.010 align:middle line:90%
ones have you been exposed to?

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Primarily the
indigenous insectoids on Mars,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.060 align:middle line:84%
which I realize some people
refer to them as a mantid

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.030 align:middle line:84%
species, which I don't
necessarily want to disagree

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.132 align:middle line:90%
with, because potato, potato.

00:02:08.132 --> 00:02:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
that that's wrong,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.950 align:middle line:84%
but to me, they really look
more or less like a giant ant.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.397 align:middle line:84%
So you can call them
a mantid species,

00:02:15.397 --> 00:02:17.480 align:middle line:84%
I have no problem with
that, but I think sometimes

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.510 align:middle line:84%
the confusion is that
a mantid species is

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.430 align:middle line:84%
like a praying
mantis, and that's

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.160 align:middle line:84%
not my experience of them at
all, that they're basically

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.930 align:middle line:90%
like a giant ant.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Maybe since I've heard
this terminology thrown

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.090 align:middle line:84%
around interchangeably
and I'm not so sure

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.590 align:middle line:84%
that they're
interchangeable I guess

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.620 align:middle line:90%
is what I'm trying to say.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are they in
other places besides Mars?

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.058 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I think there are
a number of insectoid species.

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:40.760 align:middle line:84%
We certainly have an indigenous
insectoid species here

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.330 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth
that's subterranean.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Indigenous insectoid
species on Mars.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
insect or species

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.905 align:middle line:84%
that I'm aware of that are
different than that as well.

00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Could you give me
some examples to the audience

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.610 align:middle line:84%
of some different types
of insectoids besides like

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.160 align:middle line:90%
the ants and the mantis people?

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Sure.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.000 align:middle line:84%
There's another species
that we encountered

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:84%
who their physiological stance
and their physiological posture

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.860 align:middle line:90%
was very, very different.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:84%
So these insectoids that
we dealt with on Mars,

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:84%
you basically just think of
an ant that's standing up.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.670 align:middle line:90%
So it's basically on two legs.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.660 align:middle line:84%
The middle appendages can
be used to steady themselves

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:84%
or as other feet
if they need to,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.730 align:middle line:84%
or they can be used as
an extra set of hands,

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.230 align:middle line:84%
so they're kind of
an appendage that

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.710 align:middle line:84%
can be sort of an either/or,
but they tend to upright walk.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:84%
There is another
insectoid species

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.540 align:middle line:84%
that we encountered that was
much taller, first of all.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.770 align:middle line:84%
The indigenous insectoids
from Mars were, emm,

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.367 align:middle line:90%
five-and-a-half feet tall?

00:03:47.367 --> 00:03:49.700 align:middle line:84%
About-- the drones were about
five-and-a-half feet tall.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.570 align:middle line:84%
The leader of the hive was not
a queen, it's not a female,

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.730 align:middle line:84%
it's a male, so it's
referred to as a king,

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.540 align:middle line:84%
and they're much larger, eight
times the size, probably.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.620 align:middle line:84%
We've experienced another
insectoid species who basically

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.590 align:middle line:84%
was on four appendages with
a torso that kind of came up

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:84%
from a body that was parallel
to the ground with two very

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.870 align:middle line:84%
large appendages, which sort
of appeared like grippers like

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:84%
that but then these
appendages could unfold,

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.740 align:middle line:84%
and there was like seven
or eight little phalanges

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.650 align:middle line:84%
that they could manipulate
objects with or kind of bring

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.650 align:middle line:84%
them together like three
appendages-- it was very

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.480 align:middle line:84%
peculiar, but
they're much larger.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:84%
They probably stand, oh,
easily eight to 10 feet tall

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.490 align:middle line:90%
from the ground.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I would like to talk
about the dexterity especially

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.010 align:middle line:90%
of the insectoids.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.710 align:middle line:84%
You probably have
experience with this.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: They are incredibly
agile with their phalanges.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Their ability to pick up,
manipulate objects, maneuver,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.410 align:middle line:84%
make things, operate
things is incredible.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you think about
our ability like work

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:84%
on a typewriter with 10
fingers, what would you

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.260 align:middle line:90%
do if you only had six fingers?

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.402 align:middle line:84%
Well you'd have a limited
sort of array of what

00:05:11.402 --> 00:05:12.610 align:middle line:90%
you could do on the keyboard.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:84%
But what if you had
eight fingers per hand?

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Well then you could
type way faster

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and way quicker than you
could with 10 fingers.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.570 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, they're
incredibly dexterous

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and have an incredible ability
to manipulate physical objects

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.610 align:middle line:90%
with those phalanges.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tell me about the
speed of these insectoids.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.470 align:middle line:84%
We know they have
great dexterity,

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.633 align:middle line:90%
but they also are very strong.

00:05:34.633 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Incredibly
strong, and really fast.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Like the first time that I
had seen one of these larger

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:90%
insectoids kind of--

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say scurry,
but kind of run at speed,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:90%
it was incredible.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were
easily achieving

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.425 align:middle line:84%
speeds of 25 to 30 miles
an hour just on foot,

00:05:53.425 --> 00:05:54.970 align:middle line:90%
it was incredibly fast.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do they use any
other devices to get around?

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Not that
I had encountered,

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.470 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't encounter
these species in combat,

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.940 align:middle line:84%
so I imagine their combat
dress was a bit different.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How did you
communicate with these

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.170 align:middle line:90%
insectoids and other species?

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, the insectoids,
interestingly enough,

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.360 align:middle line:84%
the first time that
we encountered them,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I basically just spoke to it in
English hoping that somehow I

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.570 align:middle line:84%
would understand or-- and I
kind of made some hand gestures,

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.450 align:middle line:84%
but it surprised me when it
spoke back telepathically mind

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.250 align:middle line:90%
to mind--

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.110 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't aware that
they had that ability

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:84%
until we walked up to
them and tried to have

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.460 align:middle line:90%
a conversation with them.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What was the
conversation about?

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: It was
basically hi, how are you?

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.590 align:middle line:84%
I introduced myself
and just wanted

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.180 align:middle line:84%
to see if we could establish
a line of conversation.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.690 align:middle line:84%
We were on a patrol, a
small-- a squad on patrol,

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.870 align:middle line:84%
and we came close to the hive
and they were outside the front

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.550 align:middle line:84%
of their hive doing something
out in front there with some--

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.380 align:middle line:84%
bringing some boxes
out and sort of

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.230 align:middle line:84%
laying them out and
objects out in the--

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.840 align:middle line:84%
it turns out from what
I understand later on,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.040 align:middle line:84%
they were using natural UV
to sterilize equipment out

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.210 align:middle line:90%
in the sun.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:22.120 align:middle line:84%
So there were a bunch of them,
and we came fairly close,

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.960 align:middle line:84%
but at a safe distance, and
there was no hostile reaction

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.630 align:middle line:84%
and I gathered because there
was a small group of us

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.090 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't
perceive as a threat.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And I sat there and
thought about it

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.370 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, what would
happen if just one of us

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.800 align:middle line:84%
walked up and
introduced ourselves?

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.180 align:middle line:90%
What would happen?

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
proposing to the squad,

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I was like, what if I just go
down there and like say hi?

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And my first wife,
who I also served

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.800 align:middle line:84%
with-- we were in the same squad
in the MDF, she said, oh yeah,

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I want to see
that, I want to see

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.480 align:middle line:84%
you come running
back with one arm

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.488 align:middle line:90%
in your other arm screaming.

00:08:00.488 --> 00:08:01.780 align:middle line:90%
She was a sweetheart like that.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And so she basically was
like, I double-dog-dare you.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I went down and said
hello and it went well enough,

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.100 align:middle line:84%
and I essentially
asked the insectoid

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.380 align:middle line:84%
that I was speaking to if
I could bring friends back,

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.180 align:middle line:84%
if that would be OK, and he
was like, yeah, that's fine.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And so we went back
and I reported to my CO

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.850 align:middle line:84%
that we had made contact
and he was like, what?

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:22.650 align:middle line:90%
You did what?

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:25.067 align:middle line:84%
I was like, well, I just walked
up and thought I'd say hi,

00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:26.420 align:middle line:90%
and he was like, you did what?

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.462 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, well it
went well and I asked them

00:08:28.462 --> 00:08:30.400 align:middle line:84%
if we could come back
and they said yeah.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said, so maybe you should
talk to the Ambassadorial Corps

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.198 align:middle line:84%
and see if they want to go have
a chat with the insectoids,

00:08:35.198 --> 00:08:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and a week later, we were
going back for a visit

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.440 align:middle line:84%
and made friends at
that point, so yeah.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.789 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Any other
different-looking species that

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:45.610 align:middle line:84%
you can relate to that look
like species here on Earth like

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:46.900 align:middle line:90%
our animals and fish?

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.620 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, there were
a few aquatic species that

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.660 align:middle line:90%
existed in a fluid environment.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So there was cephalopods,
there was a species

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:05.740 align:middle line:84%
that I would have to say seemed
maybe almost shark-like if you

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:11.950 align:middle line:84%
can think of what an intelligent
shark might look like with two

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.550 align:middle line:90%
tentacles for arms.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.480 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So like a
shark body with two

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.610 align:middle line:90%
tentacles-- it very peculiar.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.650 align:middle line:84%
But again, big mouth,
big teeth like a shark,

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.230 align:middle line:90%
so I imagine that they--

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Were they vegetarian?

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: No, they
were carnivores,

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.557 align:middle line:90%
they were meat-eaters.

00:09:25.557 --> 00:09:27.730 align:middle line:84%
But not like they were
looking at us like food,

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.410 align:middle line:84%
but they definitely
were meat-eaters.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So you didn't
feel threatened by them?

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:31.873 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: No, not at all.

00:09:31.873 --> 00:09:35.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were certainly
separated by a barrier,

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:39.150 align:middle line:84%
they were in a fluid-- basically
a box of a fluid environment

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.400 align:middle line:90%
and we were on the other side.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.520 align:middle line:90%
So it felt safe enough.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.810 align:middle line:90%
It was a little--

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.600 align:middle line:84%
it was one of the creepier
I guess instances,

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.310 align:middle line:84%
but yeah, we felt
safe enough because we

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.620 align:middle line:84%
were on the other side--
and in a safe space

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.773 align:middle line:84%
where people didn't
scuffle with each other.

00:09:52.773 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Didn't have to
worry about getting

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.350 align:middle line:84%
eaten in the intergalactic
space station.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I have also heard you
speak of these worms on Mars.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.240 align:middle line:90%
Is it on Mars, these worms?

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:01.755 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: The centipedes?

00:10:01.755 --> 00:10:02.555 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yes.

00:10:02.555 --> 00:10:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Oh God.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Let's talk about the
centipedes and what did they

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:90%
actually look like.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Did they look like
Earth centipedes?

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: So the centipedes
were a genetically-engineered

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:20.050 align:middle line:84%
being that the insectoids
made and used in combat.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:26.390 align:middle line:90%
So imagine a centipede that's--

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:31.240 align:middle line:84%
its width is about a meter,
that its length is probably

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:84%
almost 20 feet long,
mandibles this wide.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:84%
They rear up like that and
then strike down on top of you.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough, the
color of their segmentation

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:49.270 align:middle line:84%
of their exoskeleton was
actually almost fuchsia,

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.817 align:middle line:84%
like almost-- like a pinkish
purple color, which I thought--

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Beautiful.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: They're actually kind
of gorgeous except terrifying.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.930 align:middle line:84%
I had certainly encountered
them enough times in the field

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.895 align:middle line:84%
that they were
absolutely terrifying--

00:11:00.895 --> 00:11:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do they use any type
of psionic activity to control

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:05.640 align:middle line:90%
you or anything?

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: No, the centipedes
I would say were not highly

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.590 align:middle line:90%
intelligent.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:15.880 align:middle line:84%
They were not like less
intelligent than a dog,

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.980 align:middle line:84%
but they were certainly
not as intelligent

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.410 align:middle line:90%
as you or I would be either.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: But they
acted on their own--

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: They acted on
orders from the drones,

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:30.700 align:middle line:84%
from the insectoid drones, but
they also seemed to know what

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.040 align:middle line:90%
their sort of guard duties were.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.530 align:middle line:84%
So they weren't
necessarily I think

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.800 align:middle line:84%
given specific instructions
all the time, but again,

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.380 align:middle line:84%
maybe like a dog, it could--
so attack, heel, return

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.180 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.555 align:middle line:84%
So there were some
basic commands

00:11:45.555 --> 00:11:47.110 align:middle line:84%
that I think that
they responded to.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It sounds like
a programming of a being

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.860 align:middle line:84%
for a search and
destroy-type mission.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.708 align:middle line:84%
They were genetically
engineered for the purpose

00:11:54.708 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:90%
that they were built for.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.180 align:middle line:84%
So they were not
a natural species

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.520 align:middle line:84%
that had been domesticated
by the insectoids,

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.770 align:middle line:84%
they were genetically
engineered from the ground up

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.518 align:middle line:90%
as a foot soldier--

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:07.810 align:middle line:90%
as a foot soldier in the field.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are there others
out there species that have

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.970 align:middle line:84%
engineered being
strictly for combat use?

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah, oh definitely.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So the Draconians
do the same thing.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.020 align:middle line:84%
They genetically
engineered their ground

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.600 align:middle line:84%
forces, again, basically
from the ground

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.270 align:middle line:84%
up for specific duties,
specific purposes,

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.370 align:middle line:90%
specific tactical protocols.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.520 align:middle line:84%
The insectoids definitely
did that, yeah, for sure.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Were you ever exposed
to like any birds or avians,

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.010 align:middle line:84%
any type of extraterrestrials
that look like birds?

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: We encountered a
species in the intergalactic

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:50.200 align:middle line:84%
space station that I would say
was derived evolutionary from

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.220 align:middle line:90%
an avian species.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.830 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Where you and I have
hair on their head,

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.480 align:middle line:84%
they had sort of a slicked-back
feather that was basically

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle line:90%
black--

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.910 align:middle line:90%
like black feathers.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Their skin tone was like
an ash-gray kind of color.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Their appendages were like claws
that were less threatening.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.798 align:middle line:84%
So the claws were actually
filed down quite a bit

00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:22.090 align:middle line:84%
so that they could manipulate
things with their fingers

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:23.280 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, and--

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They had four-- they
have five-- oh, four fingers?

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Like a thumb
and three fingers,

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:28.775 align:middle line:90%
so they had like four digits.

00:13:28.775 --> 00:13:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Of course,
did have feathers?

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: The feathers that
they seem to have left over

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.580 align:middle line:84%
on their bodies were sort
of like a blackish feather,

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.445 align:middle line:84%
and they were about
six-and-a-half feet tall maybe?

00:13:39.445 --> 00:13:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What about
their eyes and eye color?

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.895 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: They
had like a dark--

00:13:45.895 --> 00:13:48.940 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.120 align:middle line:84%
in the right light, it
appeared sort of black,

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.850 align:middle line:84%
but if there was just
the right reflection

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.350 align:middle line:84%
from another light
source, you could

00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:00.190 align:middle line:84%
see that there was a pupil
and an iris underneath what

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:05.320 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be a dark maybe
photosensitive covering

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.240 align:middle line:90%
or film that was over the eye.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So most of the time
you were just looked

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.860 align:middle line:84%
like you were looking at
a black eye, but if you--

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.330 align:middle line:84%
the light caught
it just right, you

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.240 align:middle line:84%
could see that there was an
iris and a pupil underneath.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Was the pupil round?

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: It looked round
from what I could see,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.360 align:middle line:84%
but because you're looking
at it through, again,

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.010 align:middle line:84%
this sort of
photosensitive film,

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:27.310 align:middle line:84%
it seemed round to me anyway
from what I could see.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what
about the mouth?

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Was there a beak,
was there teeth?

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.090 align:middle line:90%
Was there like a mandible?

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Yeah, I'd say that
the jaw and the beak may be

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:44.080 align:middle line:84%
extended no more than two to
three inches from the face.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Was a kind of a
whitish-yellowish color.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.813 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And where
did they live?

00:14:52.813 --> 00:14:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I'm not sure exactly
where that they were from.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.772 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't part of
the conversation.

00:14:56.772 --> 00:14:58.155 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:14:58.155 --> 00:15:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Did these avians have wings
or two arms, two legs?

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.160 align:middle line:90%
How do they maneuver around?

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: They
were on two legs.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:15.555 align:middle line:84%
And the arms, interestingly
enough, seemed to be a--

00:15:15.555 --> 00:15:18.463 align:middle line:90%


00:15:18.463 --> 00:15:19.880 align:middle line:84%
this is a kind of
weird, because I

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:84%
know they were an avian
species, but their arms almost

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.290 align:middle line:90%
looked at like a bat arm.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So there was a hand at
the end of a wing that

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.510 align:middle line:90%
seemed tucked in.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.020 align:middle line:84%
So I never saw one like
unfurl, and I'd seriously

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.390 align:middle line:84%
doubt that they had flight
capabilities at that point,

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.840 align:middle line:84%
but it was more like
a vestigial wing that

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.618 align:middle line:84%
had evolved into a hand
with, again, with digits

00:15:46.618 --> 00:15:47.660 align:middle line:90%
and phalanges on the end.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.390 align:middle line:90%
It was a little peculiar.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.310 align:middle line:84%
If I was to take a
stab in the dark,

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:56.840 align:middle line:84%
I would say that that wasn't a
natural evolution, that somehow

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.290 align:middle line:84%
they got to that stage with a
genetic tinkering or evolution

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:01.880 align:middle line:90%
from some other species.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How did
they communicate?

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.155 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: In that
particular instance,

00:16:05.155 --> 00:16:06.830 align:middle line:84%
they communicated
through a translator.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:10.153 align:middle line:84%
So there was a biological person
who acted as this translator.

00:16:10.153 --> 00:16:12.320 align:middle line:84%
So they would speak, the
translator would translate,

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.737 align:middle line:84%
we would speak,
and the translator

00:16:13.737 --> 00:16:15.080 align:middle line:90%
would translate back to them.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What did it
sound like, their voices?

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Like a low
whistle and a low click.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So if we think of listening
to a bird outside and the way

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:34.240 align:middle line:84%
that it chirps, think of that
as like an avian shouting.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And that if that avian
or bird was actually

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:40.930 align:middle line:84%
speaking in a
conversational tone,

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:46.270 align:middle line:84%
it would be a much more subdued
low clicks, low whistles

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.430 align:middle line:90%
kind of a communication.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So when you think of a bird on
a tree limb, it's not talking,

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.620 align:middle line:84%
it's yelling, it's
screaming with its voice.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What's the
relationship between

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.170 align:middle line:84%
the non-human ETs
and the human ETs?

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: It depends,
like anything else.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.690 align:middle line:84%
So again, 95% of
the species that we

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.750 align:middle line:84%
run into across the
board would rather trade.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So in any individual
situation like that,

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.720 align:middle line:84%
it has more to do with what
their biological and/or

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.619 align:middle line:84%
social civilization needs are
and what their resources are,

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:25.000 align:middle line:84%
what our biological
civilization social needs are

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.640 align:middle line:84%
and what our resources are,
and whether we have something

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.210 align:middle line:90%
to exchange.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And exchange is
essentially based on,

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:35.020 align:middle line:84%
do we have something
that's less expensive cost

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.050 align:middle line:84%
to trade with them that
would otherwise cost them

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.360 align:middle line:84%
more to get somewhere else
or to make or manufacture,

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.600 align:middle line:90%
mine themselves?

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.390 align:middle line:84%
That they have
something that's going

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.820 align:middle line:84%
to cost less than it
would cost us to make,

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:84%
mine, get ourselves or
manufacture ourselves

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.220 align:middle line:90%
or get from someone else?

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.820 align:middle line:84%
That's the basis of
a trade relationship.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Do you have something
worth trading

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.530 align:middle line:90%
that's cost-effective to trade?

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:59.423 align:middle line:84%
And if there's any relationship
available like that,

00:17:59.423 --> 00:18:01.840 align:middle line:84%
then we're going to have a
conversation about it for sure.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:06.850 align:middle line:84%
So I have certainly
seen non-human species

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:10.720 align:middle line:84%
and human species communicate
and interact with one another.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that I've seen too
much of them working together

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:19.153 align:middle line:84%
just based on my personal
experiences and where I was at.

00:18:19.153 --> 00:18:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Through your
experience of all these

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:25.580 align:middle line:84%
different species, what is their
intelligence and what are they

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.380 align:middle line:90%
good at?

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.945 align:middle line:84%
Like are these people from
Arcturus good at this?

00:18:28.945 --> 00:18:30.835 align:middle line:90%
Are the Sirians good at that?

00:18:30.835 --> 00:18:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: It's certainly--

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:36.040 align:middle line:84%
I would say that they have a
wide range of intelligence.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.780 align:middle line:84%
So you can have species who
are as intelligent as us,

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.690 align:middle line:84%
maybe a little more,
maybe a lot more.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And certainly the emotional
content or emotional range,

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.320 align:middle line:90%
it also can vary quite a bit.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So not all species have
complex deep emotions.

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:01.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that seems to be
more rare than it is common.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:06.590 align:middle line:84%
So you can run into species
that are very intellectually

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.400 align:middle line:90%
strong at what they do.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.000 align:middle line:84%
They're good builders,
they're good manufacturers,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.640 align:middle line:84%
but maybe not creative,
maybe not very

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.770 align:middle line:84%
good at artistic thinking
or artistic development.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have no
music, maybe they

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.748 align:middle line:90%
have no art as we think of it.

00:19:22.748 --> 00:19:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I used to in the
projects hear that Arcturans

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.460 align:middle line:84%
were really good at
engineering and combat,

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and I heard this species is
really good with artistic

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.960 align:middle line:90%
capabilities.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Was there anything
in the projects

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.820 align:middle line:84%
that you heard or
in your missions

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.750 align:middle line:84%
that people are like, oh,
they're really good at making

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:42.910 align:middle line:90%
space vehicles, we'll say.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Right, right, sure.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, certainly the
insectoids, probably some

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.510 align:middle line:84%
of the most
brilliant geneticists

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:51.680 align:middle line:90%
that we've ever encountered.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Their understanding
of genetic engineering

00:19:54.590 --> 00:20:01.147 align:middle line:84%
and how to figure out how to run
a sequence of genes is beyond--

00:20:01.147 --> 00:20:03.230 align:middle line:84%
because most of them can
just do it in their head,

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.272 align:middle line:84%
they don't need a computer
or a machine to do it,

00:20:05.272 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:84%
they can just do all these
calculations upstairs,

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and that's incredible
to me for sure.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.940 align:middle line:84%
So their ability to
do biological genetic

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.730 align:middle line:84%
calculations,
unparalleled pretty much.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:17.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, way beyond--

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean the Draconians
are good at manipulating,

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:24.350 align:middle line:84%
but they are nowhere near the
ability of creative potential

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:25.790 align:middle line:90%
that the insectoids are.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:84%
The insectoids have the ability
to imagine what they need

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and then do the calculations
on what you would need

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.740 align:middle line:84%
to genetically engineer
that thing you need

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.417 align:middle line:84%
and then genetically
engineer that thing.

00:20:37.417 --> 00:20:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Yes, they seem
to be the most analytical

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.900 align:middle line:84%
and the most intelligent species
that we've studied so far.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:42.817 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:20:42.817 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:90%
They work 22 hours a day.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:49.710 align:middle line:84%
They sleep and eat less
than a couple hours a day.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:51.230 align:middle line:90%
They're busy, busy all the time.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:53.633 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How long do
they live, do you know?

00:20:53.633 --> 00:20:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I'm not sure
to be honest with you.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:57.330 align:middle line:84%
It was never something
that came up,

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:03.260 align:middle line:84%
but I got the impression
that an individual lifespan

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.200 align:middle line:90%
is centuries, not decades.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.918 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What are
the avians known for?

00:21:07.918 --> 00:21:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Interestingly enough,
the conversation that we had

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:15.020 align:middle line:84%
about them, they seem to
have a real strong sense

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.240 align:middle line:90%
of a biological repair.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So their medical technology
was quite advanced.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:25.640 align:middle line:84%
They had the ability to
treat biological species way

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.920 align:middle line:90%
outside their own parameters.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.540 align:middle line:84%
So their ability to treat an
injured being of any variety

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:36.080 align:middle line:84%
was pretty extensive
and pretty expansive.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:41.173 align:middle line:84%
Their ability to analyze and
scan another biological being

00:21:41.173 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and figure out
what you would need

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:45.500 align:middle line:84%
to do to treat it for
an injury or an illness

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:49.220 align:middle line:84%
or repair cellular damage,
it's fairly unparalleled.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How is their
mating and gestation?

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Is it like here on
Earth where these--

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:56.070 align:middle line:84%
our avians here, of
course, lay eggs.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:57.730 align:middle line:84%
What about these
humanoid avians?

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: In the conversations
that we had with them, yeah,

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.280 align:middle line:90%
they're egg-layers.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:09.020 align:middle line:84%
So they pretty much produce,
reproduce in a very similar way

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:13.280 align:middle line:84%
that our avians animal
species do here.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How about
the cephalopods?

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:18.650 align:middle line:84%
What was their specialty and
what were they're known for

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:20.910 align:middle line:90%
and where they come from?

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, certainly
were mathematical geniuses.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Again, their ability to
make complex mathematical

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:32.180 align:middle line:84%
computations with just
brain power is unparalleled.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
calculator computers

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.990 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
that, that's for sure.

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So any time you might have
something mathematically

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:45.730 align:middle line:84%
complex that you need
to solve, our people,

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.430 align:middle line:84%
even with our
computers and so forth,

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.890 align:middle line:84%
it might take them a
certain amount of time.

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.750 align:middle line:84%
A cephalopod, you
could probably pose

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:55.060 align:middle line:84%
them the same problem
or the same question,

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and within a minute
or two they're

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.780 align:middle line:84%
going have an answer
or a set of variables

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.980 align:middle line:84%
or a parameter of brackets
to give you as a solution.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How do these
non humanoids like look

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:08.478 align:middle line:84%
at Earthlings, at
humans, just us here?

00:23:08.478 --> 00:23:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: [LAUGHS] One
of the most interesting--

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Without insulting us.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:14.893 align:middle line:84%
No, one of the most
interesting things

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:16.690 align:middle line:84%
I found out about
the insectoids is

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:20.680 align:middle line:84%
because they have exoskeletons
with their meaty muscle

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.190 align:middle line:84%
mass on the inside,
they see us as having

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:28.153 align:middle line:84%
our insides on the outside, so
it kind of grosses them out.

00:23:28.153 --> 00:23:31.000 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So when we're actually
wearing our body armor,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.190 align:middle line:84%
that to them was
like our exoskeleton,

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and that actually was
much more comfortable,

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.242 align:middle line:84%
and when we were not
wearing that, they're-- ugh,

00:23:37.242 --> 00:23:38.367 align:middle line:90%
they were like looking at--

00:23:38.367 --> 00:23:39.167 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:23:39.167 --> 00:23:41.680 align:middle line:84%
There was-- not offensively
grossed out by it,

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.150 align:middle line:84%
but it was clearly not
attractive to them.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:44.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:47.033 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I think that's
a good point to bring up,

00:23:47.033 --> 00:23:49.720 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people
think that meetings with

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.690 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials
are really serious.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And they are kind of
like us with person--

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:57.220 align:middle line:84%
they have personalities
and they're comical, and--

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Sometimes.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.915 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: --sometimes you'll
see something that is really

00:23:59.915 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:84%
disgusting, but it's a person,
and you really have to accept

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:84%
that person for the way they
look, the way they smell,

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and all that in order for you
to move amongst the stars.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're definitely stinky
mammals, too, for sure.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Like we are-- in a lineup of
a hundred species at random,

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:21.220 align:middle line:84%
we're one of the stinker
ones for sure, yeah.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: When I say the
word multidimensional,

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.520 align:middle line:84%
multidimensional beings,
what comes to mind?

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.927 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, without
trying to take too much time

00:24:30.927 --> 00:24:33.010 align:middle line:84%
to explain what we understand
to be the difference

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:37.780 align:middle line:84%
of dimensional harmonics,
dimensional harmonics are

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:42.850 align:middle line:84%
vibrations of matter and
energy and space at completely

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:44.350 align:middle line:90%
different spatial frequencies.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:47.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible
for a being to exist

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.240 align:middle line:84%
in a dimensional frequency that
is outside of our own while

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.640 align:middle line:90%
occupying similar space.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So there could be, for instance,
a multidimensional being

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.810 align:middle line:84%
standing right there that
you and I would never

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:05.470 align:middle line:84%
see with the naked eye-- with
our visible light spectrum,

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:08.170 align:middle line:84%
maybe never noticed was
there because they're

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:10.180 align:middle line:84%
in a different
dimensional frequency.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Now there's two different
ways to look at that, too.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.540 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that that being
existing where it exists

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.330 align:middle line:84%
doesn't perceive us
it all, doesn't even--

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.660 align:middle line:84%
isn't even aware that we're
here and is existing in a space

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.120 align:middle line:84%
in which this room is
completely different,

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.040 align:middle line:84%
the objects are
completely different,

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.010 align:middle line:84%
the space is
completely different,

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and there's not even any
interaction whatsoever,

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:36.790 align:middle line:84%
whereas if they come closer to
our outerdimensional frequency

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:39.610 align:middle line:84%
is where there's going
to be some crossover,

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden they may
experiencing this room with

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.260 align:middle line:84%
these objects with
you and I in it,

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.630 align:middle line:84%
but still maintain
that out-of-phase--

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Just fluxing right out
of that frequency just a little

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.160 align:middle line:90%
bit.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Just outside of our
frequency that continue to be

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:55.360 align:middle line:90%
out of phase or invisible.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.818 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Have you ever noticed
one bleed in and bleed out?

00:25:57.818 --> 00:25:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Oh absolutely.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I've absolutely
experienced that before, sure.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:02.562 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Can you explain that?

00:26:02.562 --> 00:26:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I remember one time
when I was deployed on a ship

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.350 align:middle line:84%
that was basically a special
forces ship that had 18

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:15.310 align:middle line:84%
different special forces units
on it that was a transportation

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:18.340 align:middle line:84%
and deployment vessel
for special forces units,

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.120 align:middle line:84%
and we had entered into an area
of space in which we were given

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:27.130 align:middle line:84%
a heads-up that one of the
planets had a species that was

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:30.423 align:middle line:84%
in a different dimensional
frequency but highly curious.

00:26:30.423 --> 00:26:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And so we were
informed that there

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.630 align:middle line:84%
was a very good chance that
while we were in that space,

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:37.300 align:middle line:84%
we could see these beings just
coming in and out of the ship

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.550 align:middle line:84%
curiously, checking this
out and looking at us

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and not to freak out,
not to get scared.

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.710 align:middle line:90%
And so we're used to--

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:46.840 align:middle line:84%
we used to say, oh, I
saw another ghost today,

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.660 align:middle line:84%
even though they weren't ghosts,
they just sort of seemed just

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.613 align:middle line:90%
to sort of come in and out.

00:26:52.613 --> 00:26:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you'd just see it
out of the corner of your eye,

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:57.038 align:middle line:84%
you'd look, and
then sometimes they

00:26:57.038 --> 00:26:59.080 align:middle line:84%
would recognize that all
of a sudden you see them

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.705 align:middle line:84%
and they would go,
oh, oh, they see me,

00:27:00.705 --> 00:27:02.420 align:middle line:84%
and then they blink
right back out again.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.140 align:middle line:84%
But usually it was-- it seemed
more like just a curiosity

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:05.950 align:middle line:90%
than anything else.

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:08.540 align:middle line:84%
They weren't being
invasive or harmful,

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.250 align:middle line:84%
they were just very
curious, and so

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:13.420 align:middle line:84%
was easy enough for them to
come in and out of that space

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.150 align:middle line:84%
to observe what we were
doing without any sort

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:18.312 align:middle line:84%
of physical threat
to themselves or even

00:27:18.312 --> 00:27:20.020 align:middle line:84%
putting a physical
threat onto us either.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So it was a weird experience,
because the entire time

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.530 align:middle line:84%
we were there, there were
just these beings that

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.120 align:middle line:84%
would just kind of
blink in and out

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:84%
or walk through walls
and things like that.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.510 align:middle line:84%
It was just a little weird,
but we kind of got used to it,

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:36.220 align:middle line:90%
it was all right.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What about the
interdimensional beings?

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible all
through your experience

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:47.110 align:middle line:84%
that they can host many
different bodies at one

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:50.550 align:middle line:90%
time in different dimensions?

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: There are some
species who seem to have

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:55.680 align:middle line:90%
achieved that ability to--

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.390 align:middle line:84%
what's the word I
want to use there?

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.870 align:middle line:90%
To be multiconscious.

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:01.740 align:middle line:90%
And so to--

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Multidimensional.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:07.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to really to
have multiple bodies that

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:10.080 align:middle line:84%
are connected to a
singular consciousness

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.260 align:middle line:84%
across different material
planes or different energetic

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.440 align:middle line:90%
dimensional planes.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Just-- even still
today, a little

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:20.460 align:middle line:84%
complicated for my
brain to wrap around it,

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.670 align:middle line:84%
but I mean, we've had
discussions with those beings

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:27.390 align:middle line:84%
and they've attempted
to explain to us what

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:31.290 align:middle line:84%
it is to exist in that way, to
be in several places at once

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and in multiple bodies
at the same time

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.390 align:middle line:84%
while sharing a conscious
understanding of all of those

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:40.320 align:middle line:84%
places at the same time,
and encourage us to think

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.500 align:middle line:84%
that that's an evolutionary
step that we can achieve

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.620 align:middle line:84%
with, again, focus
and discipline.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:55.020 align:middle line:84%
But it seemed like a good
distance away evolutionarily

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.960 align:middle line:84%
speaking from where
we are right now.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.460 align:middle line:84%
So while I could
comprehend being told,

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.300 align:middle line:84%
oh, you can learn how to do
this, too, eventually and exist

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.370 align:middle line:84%
like this eventually,
it seemed to me

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:08.280 align:middle line:84%
like when you say eventually,
I think that means

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.120 align:middle line:90%
a very, very, very long time.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that means
in 100 years or 200 years

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.260 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even 1,000 years, that
might be a long time from now

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.920 align:middle line:84%
before we could actually
master that evolutionary step.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So are you saying
we are multidimensional,

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.290 align:middle line:84%
it's just we're not at
that level yet to do that,

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:27.720 align:middle line:84%
we haven't activated
that part of us yet?

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: From what we
have come to understand,

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:35.340 align:middle line:84%
just about every biological
energetic soul spiritual being

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.820 align:middle line:84%
exists across
dimensional frequencies.

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:43.860 align:middle line:84%
So where your awareness is a
lot to do with the frequency

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.320 align:middle line:84%
that you're vibrating
at, the specific

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.190 align:middle line:90%
frequency that you exist.

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And according to the theory
as it's been explained to me,

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.850 align:middle line:84%
your ability to
change that frequency

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:57.990 align:middle line:84%
is what changes where you are,
what dimensional vibration

00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:59.850 align:middle line:90%
you exist in at that moment.

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:04.230 align:middle line:84%
So we're frequency-specific
to this dimensional frequency.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:06.900 align:middle line:84%
If we ever become
frequency-specific

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.430 align:middle line:84%
to another
dimensional frequency,

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:10.350 align:middle line:90%
then we'll find ourselves there.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.990 align:middle line:84%
They were explaining to us a
little bit of how this works,

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and so they were
attempting to explain

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:20.130 align:middle line:84%
to us that when you experience
a vibrational shift that you can

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:26.580 align:middle line:84%
hear this winding, high-pitched
sound of the crossing over

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.460 align:middle line:84%
of these dimensional
frequencies is when we're

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:33.270 align:middle line:84%
on the threshold of being
able to bi-locate into two

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:36.058 align:middle line:84%
places at once and then choose
which one we want to be at,

00:30:36.058 --> 00:30:37.350 align:middle line:90%
and then just be in that place.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:40.200 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we're here, and then
we bi-locate to here and here,

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.240 align:middle line:90%
and then decide to just be here.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.420 align:middle line:84%
That's the best theory that
I think that I can explain.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that I understand
it well enough to explain it

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:48.750 align:middle line:90%
better than that.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Fascinating, Randy.

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for coming

much for having me here.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:57.990 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
