00:00:20.318 --> 00:00:22.110 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.890 align:middle line:10%
we are with Richard Doty, a
retired special agent who served

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.360 align:middle line:10%
in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.090 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.140 align:middle line:10%
UFO/ET related intelligence.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Today we are discussing the
Baltimore abduction incident.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.593 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.593 --> 00:00:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.810 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What is the Baltimore
abduction incident and what

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.510 align:middle line:90%
happened?

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: In 1981,
a schoolteacher--

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:90%
we'll call her Maggie--

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.960 align:middle line:84%
45 years old, from
Baltimore, Maryland,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.560 align:middle line:90%
was abducted by entities.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.370 align:middle line:84%
These entities
came to her house.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.010 align:middle line:84%
She lived in a nice, pleasant
area of Baltimore, Maryland.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And they floated
her out of her house

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.580 align:middle line:84%
into an underground
facility and began

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.620 align:middle line:84%
a number of different
experiments, some

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.550 align:middle line:84%
including medical
experiments on her body.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: An underground
facility here on Earth?

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: As far as we know,
what she explained to us--

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and later on she went
through hypnosis and hypnotic

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.300 align:middle line:84%
interviews-- is that
she was floated.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:84%
She knew she was being
floated out of her bed

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.390 align:middle line:84%
and out of her house,
through a patio door,

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.440 align:middle line:90%
and she went someplace.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.070 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't see the place,
but she felt their surroundings

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.730 align:middle line:90%
as being a cool--

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.050 align:middle line:90%
nice, cool place.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.210 align:middle line:84%
She ended up in an underground
facility on a table

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.790 align:middle line:84%
with these entities, strange
looking entities standing around

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:50.590 align:middle line:90%
her.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.850 align:middle line:90%
So she knew it was--

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.250 align:middle line:84%
she thought, at least, that it
was an underground facility,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.480 align:middle line:90%
but she didn't know exactly--

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: It could have been
another craft or something.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Could be in a craft.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things,
when she later became

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.290 align:middle line:84%
involved with the
US intelligence,

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.810 align:middle line:84%
that was one of the
questions that we asked her.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Are you sure you weren't
in a craft, flying?

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And she was pretty
adamant about the fact

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:84%
that she was in an underground
facility, because it seemed

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.570 align:middle line:84%
like a stable platform
to her, and she

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:84%
didn't feel like she was
moving in any direction.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And they started doing
experiments with her.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.640 align:middle line:84%
But she was conscious during
this entire time period.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:84%
She could relay everything
they were doing.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.540 align:middle line:84%
She didn't feel any
pain or any discomfort,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and they kept assuring her that
they weren't going to hurt her.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.530 align:middle line:84%
The entities that took
her out of her residence

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.120 align:middle line:84%
that she could
see were humanoid,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.110 align:middle line:84%
and they spoke in a
mechanical voice in English.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.100 align:middle line:84%
But when she got to the facility
where they examined her,

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.960 align:middle line:84%
these entities were
entirely different.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:84%
They were small, about 4 and
1/2 to 5 foot tall, large eyes,

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.970 align:middle line:90%
large heads.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.150 align:middle line:84%
The typical Grey looking
extraterrestrials.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.430 align:middle line:84%
So we got two different,
entirely different species

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.940 align:middle line:90%
that were abducting her.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.570 align:middle line:84%
We determined or theorized
that the entities that

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.170 align:middle line:84%
took her were either
robotic, created

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.722 align:middle line:84%
by these other
extraterrestrials, the Greys,

00:03:28.722 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
or they were different species
of extraterrestrials working

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.160 align:middle line:84%
in conjunction with
the Greys, because they

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that could be seen
on Earth because they looked

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.130 align:middle line:90%
humanoid.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.970 align:middle line:90%
And they could be blend--

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.980 align:middle line:84%
they could blend into
American society.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's why they
went to Maggie's home

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and she maybe felt more at ease
looking at these things that

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.730 align:middle line:84%
looked humanoid and even spoke
English, even though it was

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:84%
in a mechanical sounding
voice and brought her

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.420 align:middle line:84%
to the other ones, the
controlling extraterrestrials,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.990 align:middle line:90%
which were probably the Greys.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So what was
their communication like?

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.178 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what were
they talking about?

00:04:15.178 --> 00:04:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, first of all,
they assured her when they first

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.800 align:middle line:84%
made contact with
her in her bedroom--

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.910 align:middle line:90%
she was in her bedroom.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.480 align:middle line:84%
When they took her
out of her bedroom,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.150 align:middle line:84%
they assured her they
weren't going to hurt her.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.670 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
you out, and we're

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:84%
going to take you to a
location where you're

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.990 align:middle line:90%
going to be medically examined.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm paraphrasing, but
that's pretty much

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:84%
the conversation
they had with her

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:84%
in English with this
mechanical sounding voice.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't move, so she
didn't really have any choice.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.560 align:middle line:90%
They lifted her.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.350 align:middle line:84%
She floated out and down to this
facility or into some facility

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:84%
where there was an
examining table.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, when she got there, she
didn't see these humanoid

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.310 align:middle line:90%
looking entities anymore.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.530 align:middle line:90%
She saw these smaller--

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:10.720 align:middle line:84%
which she'd seen on television
and other locations.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.730 align:middle line:84%
These are alien looking
entities that she's looking--

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.130 align:middle line:84%
that she has around her table
that are looking at her.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And so she realizes
that now there's

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.130 align:middle line:84%
two different entities
dealing here with her.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How long did this
session last for before she

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:29.710 align:middle line:90%
returned home?

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, she didn't have
any way of telling the time that

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.670 align:middle line:90%
she was down there.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:84%
She only remembers
going to bed that night.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:90%
And this happened at night.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.110 align:middle line:84%
She went to bed and she
remembers going to bed between

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.800 align:middle line:90%
10:30 and 11 o'clock PM.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.620 align:middle line:90%
And then it happened.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:84%
These humanoids came, floated
her out to this location,

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.860 align:middle line:84%
whether it was in a
craft or underground.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, when she got back and
realized that she was back

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.740 align:middle line:84%
in her bed, it was about 3
o'clock, 3:00 AM in the morning.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.540 align:middle line:84%
So it was a four
hour time period

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.860 align:middle line:90%
that she couldn't remember.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What
happened after that?

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, when she realizes
that she's back in her bed,

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.710 align:middle line:84%
she realized something
happened to her.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.470 align:middle line:90%
She was abducted.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So that morning,
later on that morning,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.180 align:middle line:84%
she called the Baltimore
Police Department

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.900 align:middle line:90%
and reported the incident.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.390 align:middle line:84%
She claimed that she had been
abducted and she went to some

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.730 align:middle line:84%
location-- she doesn't
remember where--

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.470 align:middle line:90%
and now she's back.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.140 align:middle line:84%
So two police officers
came to her residence

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.710 align:middle line:84%
and they interviewed her,
and she told them the story.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, they didn't
believe a word she said.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.190 align:middle line:84%
They ridiculed her,
made fun of what

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.040 align:middle line:84%
she was saying, and
suggested that she needed

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.940 align:middle line:84%
mental health,
professional help.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And so she was upset that the
police wouldn't do anything

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.360 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.420 align:middle line:84%
So then she then
turned to her minister.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: She wanted
to confide in someone.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.005 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:07:08.005 --> 00:07:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And other
than family members,

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.430 align:middle line:84%
who probably wouldn't
have believed her,

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.430 align:middle line:84%
she turned to her minister,
her Baptist minister.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So she made an appointment, went
to him and told him the story.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.980 align:middle line:84%
He thought it was a
fascinating story.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.120 align:middle line:90%
And then he said, you know what?

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.250 align:middle line:90%
You need to get ahold--

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.080 align:middle line:84%
we need to get ahold
of a UFO investigator.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.510 align:middle line:84%
They were out there
someplace, and we need

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.200 align:middle line:90%
to find somebody that would--

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.350 align:middle line:84%
somebody locally that
would listen to your story

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they could suggest
where you went from there.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yeah.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And now the minister had some
knowledge of this phenomenon

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.800 align:middle line:84%
because he had read
this someplace before.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And he looked around
and he found a guy by the name

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.080 align:middle line:84%
of John Schuessler, who
was a MUFON investigator.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.590 align:middle line:10%
And we all know who
John Schuessler is.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.000 align:middle line:10%
John Schuessler
listened to her story,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.620 align:middle line:10%
was fascinated in her story,
believed everything she said

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:10%
and suggested that
she seek help.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.790 align:middle line:10%
And he suggested that
she see a Dr. John

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:20.810 align:middle line:10%
Mack, who was a investigator
of this phenomena.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And he was in a close
area, New York City,

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.200 align:middle line:84%
and he might be
able to help her.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So in a roundabout way, she made
an appointment with Dr. Mack,

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.200 align:middle line:90%
and she went to see Dr. Mack.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's when she went
through a hypnotic interview.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And he
performed that for her?

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yeah.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.190 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Mack put her under hypnosis.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.900 align:middle line:90%
She told her entire story.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And what she told
in her story was

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.480 align:middle line:84%
that when she was
eight years old,

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.030 align:middle line:84%
she remembers these
small entities coming

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.340 align:middle line:84%
to visit her when she was
just a little girl, years old.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.550 align:middle line:90%
And all this opened up her mind.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Now she realized that
not when she was--

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.880 align:middle line:84%
this incident happened
a few weeks earlier

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.140 align:middle line:84%
wasn't the first time that she
experienced this phenomenon

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.100 align:middle line:90%
and saw these entities.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.340 align:middle line:84%
It was when she was
eight years old.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.440 align:middle line:90%
And over a period of her life--

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.700 align:middle line:84%
she's 45 now-- she was
visited a number of times

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.660 align:middle line:90%
by these entities.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.660 align:middle line:84%
She remembers when
she was in her 20s--

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.300 align:middle line:84%
she doesn't remember
the exact age--

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.070 align:middle line:84%
that they came,
and they told her

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.360 align:middle line:84%
they were taking
out an egg from her.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And when she was
36, they took one.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And they she thinks this
last time, when she was 45,

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.950 align:middle line:90%
they went in there and took--

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:90%
examined her ovarian tubes.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:51.111 align:middle line:90%
So this was what they--

00:09:51.111 --> 00:09:56.980 align:middle line:84%
why they were doing this other
than to get her eggs out.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Number one, it really upset her
after this hypnosis session,

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.160 align:middle line:90%
because she has four children.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Now, what's the
connection between what they

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.950 align:middle line:84%
were doing to her and her
birth of these four children?

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So how did the Office
of Special investigations get

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:15.882 align:middle line:84%
involved in the
first place and why?

00:10:15.882 --> 00:10:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, this is
going to be fascinating.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:24.610 align:middle line:84%
First of all, Dr. Mack, at
one time back in the late

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.680 align:middle line:84%
'50s, '60s, he was in the
United States Air Force.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.380 align:middle line:90%
He was a physician.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:35.810 align:middle line:84%
He later maintained his
connections to US intelligence.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:40.400 align:middle line:84%
So he was one of our
deep cover sources.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:84%
I talked about this once
before on an episode.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And so he was the one that
notified OSI of this incident.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And the reason he
did that was he

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.380 align:middle line:90%
thought this was so fascinating.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And he had some information
about another incident

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:03.670 align:middle line:84%
that OSI was investigating
within the DC area.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, wow.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Because Dr. Mack
was assisting OSI on that

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:90%
investigation.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:15.020 align:middle line:84%
So he felt that both
cases were connected,

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.900 align:middle line:90%
and therefore, he notified OSI.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's how OSI
became involved in this.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.250 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: So what did OSI
say after they learned about

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.700 align:middle line:10%
Maggie's experience?

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, they
visited Maggie.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.030 align:middle line:84%
They asked Maggie
if she would consent

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:37.200 align:middle line:84%
to coming to Bolling Air Force
Base to the OSI headquarters.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.630 align:middle line:84%
At that time, that's where
the headquarters was.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.640 align:middle line:90%
And undergo an interview.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yes,
she would, but it

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.150 align:middle line:90%
would have to be on a weekend.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.730 align:middle line:84%
So they took her there,
and that weekend,

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.030 align:middle line:84%
they set up an interview
room and they interviewed her

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.940 align:middle line:84%
for many hours, where
she explained everything

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.070 align:middle line:84%
that had happened to
her and everything

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.350 align:middle line:90%
that she could remember.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And OSI then realized
that her abduction

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:08.830 align:middle line:84%
was connected to something else
they were doing, because what

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:15.820 align:middle line:84%
she told OSI was that during
these different periods

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:19.420 align:middle line:84%
of contact with these
extraterrestrials, one of them

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.990 align:middle line:84%
mentioned an address
in Vienna, Virginia.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And why they told
her of this, it

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.420 align:middle line:84%
was as if they were telling
her, there's a safe house.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:34.810 align:middle line:84%
If you feel danger or you feel
uneasy about what we're doing,

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:84%
you can go to this address
on Cherry Street in Vienna,

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.330 align:middle line:90%
Virginia.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:41.672 align:middle line:90%
And she told OSI this.

00:12:41.672 --> 00:12:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: She
remembers everything.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.547 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: She
remembers everything.

00:12:44.547 --> 00:12:49.931 align:middle line:84%
Unbeknownst to her,
OSI or US intelligence

00:12:49.931 --> 00:12:53.000 align:middle line:84%
had that address on Cherry
Street under surveillance,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:84%
and they'd had it
for many months.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So now all these things
are coming together.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's why OSI realized
that the story she's telling

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.032 align:middle line:90%
was absolutely factual.

00:13:04.032 --> 00:13:04.832 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:04.832 --> 00:13:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So how did
they proceed from there?

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: A few weeks
later, or sometime later,

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:84%
she went back to OSI and
went through what we refer

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:17.690 align:middle line:84%
to a hypnotic interview
by OSI psychologists.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And these are really, really,
really deep, hypnotic interviews

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.900 align:middle line:84%
that can really go back
into the mind of a human

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.620 align:middle line:84%
and bring out every single
thing that they don't remember

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.670 align:middle line:90%
about a particular incident.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.020 align:middle line:90%
So they did this to her.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And then she went to
three different sessions

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:41.250 align:middle line:84%
because they realized the first
session lasted a several hours,

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and as you know, because
you're a medical professional,

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.618 align:middle line:84%
you can only be in a hypnosis
for a certain period of time,

00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:90%
and you have to bring them out.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yes.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And so she had to go
through three different hypnosis

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.880 align:middle line:84%
sessions and they
recorded over 35 hours--

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: --of her interviews
over those three sessions.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:06.400 align:middle line:84%
35 hours, where she
detailed to these OSI agents

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and a psychologist
that's conducting

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.920 align:middle line:84%
this hypnosis, everything
that happened to her during--

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.650 align:middle line:84%
since she was eight years
old and now, 37 years later.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And this was amazing information
that is brought out now

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:84%
by this person who suffered
for all those years

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.430 align:middle line:84%
that US intelligence
didn't know about.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Specifics about how
they were placing things in her

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:39.420 align:middle line:90%
nose.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.620 align:middle line:84%
They also implanted a
small chip in her left foot

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.830 align:middle line:90%
above her toe, her big toe.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.940 align:middle line:84%
She told him about this,
and of course, after that,

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:55.040 align:middle line:84%
they had a military
physician come in.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it was
a podiatrist or what,

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and he examined-- took an X-ray
and found that chip in her toe,

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.990 align:middle line:90%
a device, whatever it is.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:08.090 align:middle line:84%
But they realized that that
device was sending out a signal.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.910 align:middle line:84%
But the strange thing about
this, and really strange,

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:16.340 align:middle line:84%
is that the only time
that chip would activate

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.450 align:middle line:90%
is when she was asleep.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.090 align:middle line:84%
When she was awake,
walking around,

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.330 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't get a
signal to activate.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.070 align:middle line:84%
But they put her to sleep,
that signal came on.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Which probably let the
extraterrestrials know where she

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:90%
was.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, another thing, a
strange thing about this.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.780 align:middle line:84%
She spent time at her mother's
house in Northern Maryland,

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:43.470 align:middle line:84%
not in Baltimore, but in another
house in Northern Maryland.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:44.760 align:middle line:90%
Her mother lived there.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.970 align:middle line:90%
She would go there.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:47.590 align:middle line:84%
During this hypnotic
interview, she

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.420 align:middle line:90%
realized they kept track of her.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.720 align:middle line:90%
They knew where she was.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:56.280 align:middle line:10%
She took a trip to Florida one
summer when she was married.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.280 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't married at the
time she was divorced.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.700 align:middle line:84%
But when she was married,
they took a trip to Florida.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.690 align:middle line:84%
She realized that while she
was in a hotel room, when

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.300 align:middle line:84%
her husband and her
children were out in a pool,

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.480 align:middle line:90%
they took her.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.480 align:middle line:84%
When she realized that
she was being taken again,

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.080 align:middle line:84%
she was taken to an underground
facility and examined.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.940 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to her like
she was there for hours.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:23.950 align:middle line:84%
But when she got back
in her bed and realized

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.850 align:middle line:84%
that she was awake and
looked at the clock,

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:84%
there was only a few
minutes that went by.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:84%
That made her extremely
nervous and upset

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.580 align:middle line:84%
because she didn't
know what that meant.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.990 align:middle line:84%
How could they have taken
her for hours but only

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.790 align:middle line:90%
a few minutes?

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:38.662 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:16:38.662 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And she realized that
there must be some different

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:48.230 align:middle line:84%
time period or time sequence
that's different between them

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.430 align:middle line:90%
and us.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So once
OSI got involved,

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.090 align:middle line:90%
was she put up on surveillance?

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yes, she was.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.010 align:middle line:84%
OSI agents approached
her and told her

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:02.910 align:middle line:84%
that they wanted to set up some
listening devices and cameras,

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:06.109 align:middle line:84%
motion activated cameras
inside her residence

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.000 align:middle line:90%
or her house in Baltimore.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.060 align:middle line:84%
She kind of hesitated
to proving that.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:84%
But they guaranteed her that
everything they recorded

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:19.940 align:middle line:84%
would be confidential,
unless she

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.360 align:middle line:90%
authorized the release of it.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.849 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: And so she agreed.

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:27.200 align:middle line:84%
So OSI set up cameras,
motion detection cameras,

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and other listening
devices in her residence.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And over a period
of several weeks,

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.950 align:middle line:84%
they recorded these things
coming in to her house

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:38.180 align:middle line:90%
and taking her away.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.510 align:middle line:84%
A couple times this
happened that she never

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.750 align:middle line:90%
realized it happened.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: That one
particular time,

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:51.810 align:middle line:84%
it was photographed that these
things came in through a patio

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:58.020 align:middle line:84%
door, a glass door, and
these things were there.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.200 align:middle line:90%
They took her.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.040 align:middle line:90%
She watched this video.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.230 align:middle line:84%
She says, I don't-- and
it was date stamped,

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.150 align:middle line:90%
so she knew what date it was.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:07.950 align:middle line:90%
And time.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Again, about 11:30
or 12 o'clock PM.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.025 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And she
doesn't remember that.

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.690 align:middle line:84%
She says, I don't
remember that one.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Did you see
these images, Rick?

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yeah, I did see.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what
did they look like?

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: These things
were human looking.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Just human looking?

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Human.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:28.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these humanoids could
be walking down the street.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.410 align:middle line:84%
They had a suit
on, but it didn't

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.160 align:middle line:84%
appear to be a suit
that we would wear.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.390 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to be like
a one piece suit

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:84%
or almost like a
longer jacket that

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.620 align:middle line:90%
went down about to their legs.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.020 align:middle line:84%
But their facial
appearance, they

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.770 align:middle line:90%
were very, very light in color.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Although this is a
black and white--

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Were
they tall or short?

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:49.378 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: They were very tall.

00:18:49.378 --> 00:18:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Probably 5'8 or so.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:90%
And they looked humanoid.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:59.320 align:middle line:84%
Now the only things that
were strange is their eyes.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Two of the close ups,
as they were coming in,

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.370 align:middle line:84%
one of the cameras got a
close look of their face.

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Their eyes didn't
appear to have--

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.200 align:middle line:84%
they were not like
our eyes, with pupils

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:90%
and the white part of our eyes.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.840 align:middle line:84%
They all seem to be
dark, the pupils.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
the only thing that I

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:23.390 align:middle line:90%
saw that was different than us.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.440 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: Was there any cameras
outside to see if they went

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.730 align:middle line:10%
into a spaceship or if they
load her into a car or what?

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yes.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that's really
strange is that they floated.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, wow.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: They didn't walk.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And when they
came in, they didn't walk.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Although the camera didn't
film their lower part

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.960 align:middle line:90%
of their extremities.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.190 align:middle line:84%
But you could see the movement
of them, they floated.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And as they got
up to her bedroom

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and one stood on
each side of her bed,

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:84%
they brought their hands up
and their palms up like this,

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:03.450 align:middle line:84%
as if they had some kind
of ability to bring her up

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:05.460 align:middle line:90%
into a floating motion.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.740 align:middle line:90%
And they floated her out.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And when they got her outside,
they seemed to disappear.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.210 align:middle line:84%
The cameras didn't
photograph them getting

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:16.510 align:middle line:90%
in any kind of spaceship.

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:17.552 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Dematerialized.

00:20:17.552 --> 00:20:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: They just disappeared.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, on one occasion, it
was heavy rain outside.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:27.760 align:middle line:90%
It was a downpour.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And when they got outside,
one of the cameras--

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.570 align:middle line:84%
the inside camera
was facing outside.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Looked like there was an aura
around the two humanoids.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So was there some sort of a
cover to prevent the rain?

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.600 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what it was.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it was just the way
the camera was looking out

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.450 align:middle line:90%
into a lighted--

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.190 align:middle line:84%
because there were
street lights outside.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.670 align:middle line:90%
So we don't really know.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:58.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they ever
figured out what that was.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.430 align:middle line:84%
But we never saw her
get into a spaceship.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And the cameras
probably picked up her being

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:90%
returned, or no?

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Once she got
near the patio window,

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:12.220 align:middle line:84%
the camera activated, because
it was motion activated.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And it showed her coming back
and putting back in her bed.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And that particular time,
she couldn't remember it.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.810 align:middle line:84%
We tried-- we didn't
put her under hypnosis,

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:23.852 align:middle line:90%
but we tried to get her--

00:21:23.852 --> 00:21:26.435 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we interviewed her and
interviewed her and interviewed

00:21:26.435 --> 00:21:28.310 align:middle line:84%
her, and she just
doesn't remember that.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: But the one that was
after that, she does remember.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:38.870 align:middle line:84%
In that particular one,
OSI agents set it up.

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:43.420 align:middle line:84%
They planted themselves in the
residence to catch these things.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And unfortunately,
they came in and got her,

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.695 align:middle line:84%
floated her out before the
OSI agents could react.

00:21:54.695 --> 00:21:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: They
couldn't see them?

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And, well, a few
weeks later, OSI set up,

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:84%
and they had more
agents at this time.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.890 align:middle line:84%
They had the FBI and they
had some other personnel

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.542 align:middle line:84%
from another intelligence
agency there.

00:22:07.542 --> 00:22:09.250 align:middle line:84%
The first time that
they didn't get them,

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.950 align:middle line:84%
there were only a couple
of OSI agents present.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.530 align:middle line:84%
This time, they were
set for anything.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And as these two
humanoids came in,

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:84%
as they started to
approach her bed.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:25.690 align:middle line:84%
OSI agents reacted and captured
them, put them in handcuffs.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, once they were in
handcuffs, they told--

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:32.460 align:middle line:84%
these mechanically
speaking humanoids

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.170 align:middle line:90%
told OSI they were her friend.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:39.970 align:middle line:84%
They were Maggie's friends, and
she's allowed them to be here.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:45.920 align:middle line:84%
But as they took them downstairs
and out to the waiting van,

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.910 align:middle line:84%
they wake Maggie up and
they said, we got these two.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.135 align:middle line:90%
We want you to identify them.

00:22:52.135 --> 00:22:54.100 align:middle line:90%
But they said, listen, listen.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Did you authorize these
people, these humanoids

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.770 align:middle line:90%
to come to your house?

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.790 align:middle line:90%
She said, no.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:04.940 align:middle line:90%
That's all we need to know.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: So these two were going
to be taken to a safe house some

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:12.830 align:middle line:90%
distance away and interrogated.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, along
the way, they escaped.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And what OSI and federal
agencies ended up doing

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.540 align:middle line:84%
was raiding the Virginia
residence on Cherry Street.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Oh, right.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:28.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And that residence
was registered to an Amos King.

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, there's no record
of a Amos King ever living

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:39.390 align:middle line:90%
at that residence.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And so they raided
the residence.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.810 align:middle line:90%
Everything was gone.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So, Rick, how
do you think they escaped?

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: It's a good question.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: I mean, yeah.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Both OSI Agents that
were transporting these--

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:53.130 align:middle line:90%
and it was in a van.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:54.420 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't in a car.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:55.650 align:middle line:90%
It was in a van.

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:59.790 align:middle line:84%
There was one in the back
with the two humanoids,

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and there was an
OSI agent driving.

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:05.630 align:middle line:84%
There was an OSI agent
vehicle behind them

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.890 align:middle line:84%
with an OSI agent
and an FBI agent.

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And there was another
vehicle, I believe

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:13.850 align:middle line:84%
it was a Virginia State
trooper, in front,

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and they were going
to a location.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:23.720 align:middle line:84%
The agent in the back said
that these two started

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:29.630 align:middle line:90%
almost morphing their face.

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Their face appeared to be
morphing into something else.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And he told the driver, pull
over, pull over, pull over,

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:38.130 align:middle line:90%
pull over.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:40.130 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to
have a problem back here.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Wow.

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And when they pull
over to the side of the road,

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.790 align:middle line:84%
these things kind of
dematerialized and went out

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:47.350 align:middle line:90%
through the side of the van.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:49.403 align:middle line:90%
Now, if they have that ability--

00:24:49.403 --> 00:24:50.203 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah.

00:24:50.203 --> 00:24:51.003 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:51.003 --> 00:24:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: There's not much
we could do about that.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.400 align:middle line:90%
And of course, they left.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And the ironic part about
this, the ending of this

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:84%
is that she was never visited
again by these things.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And have you
guys seen them at OSI?

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: We've seen
them in other incidents,

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.250 align:middle line:90%
other abduction stories.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:15.580 align:middle line:84%
But Maggie was free of
them, and she thanked us.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.870 align:middle line:90%
Got rid of them.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: From your
experience and perspective,

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:20.860 align:middle line:84%
what do you think
this was about?

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: They're concentrating
their efforts on the eggs

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.350 align:middle line:90%
of a female, a human female.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And so what they do with them
after that, we can only guess.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.670 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: Through all your
testing with OSI, with Maggie,

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:37.910 align:middle line:10%
did you guys notice anything
that was special or different

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:40.280 align:middle line:10%
about Maggie that they
would choose Maggie?

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: That's a good question.

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Maggie was an
African-American female.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:51.230 align:middle line:10%
She grew up in poverty.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:52.950 align:middle line:90%
She put herself through college.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:54.000 align:middle line:90%
She was a teacher.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.140 align:middle line:84%
She taught elementary
school, taught second grade,

00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.580 align:middle line:90%
and I think fourth grade.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:02.990 align:middle line:90%
She was married and divorced.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:06.630 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have anything that
we determined in her background.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Although her mother
was still alive,

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:14.240 align:middle line:84%
she didn't know where her father
was, and she had two sisters.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:20.270 align:middle line:84%
One sister cooperated and we
obtained some DNA evidence.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Her children all refused
to cooperate with the OSI

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:28.550 align:middle line:84%
investigation, so we could
never get any DNA from them.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.382 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: But you
did get Maggie's DNA?

00:26:30.382 --> 00:26:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: We got Maggie's DNA.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Was there
extraterrestrial DNA in it?

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I'm not a doctor
and I'm not a scientist,

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.190 align:middle line:84%
but there were some
peculiarities in her DNA,

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.170 align:middle line:84%
and that's all I know
and that's all I read.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.628 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm sure there's probably
more to it that I don't know

00:26:44.628 --> 00:26:47.180 align:middle line:90%
and had never been briefed into.

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So do you believe
Maggie was a hybrid?

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I would
have to say yes.

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:55.580 align:middle line:84%
I believe that Maggie
was, in fact, a hybrid.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:27:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And if we were able to, if OSI
or the scientists within the US

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence Service was
able to go back and track

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:10.330 align:middle line:84%
her heritage, which we
didn't do or couldn't do,

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:13.162 align:middle line:84%
I think we would have found out
that she was probably a hybrid.

00:27:13.162 --> 00:27:13.962 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:27:13.962 --> 00:27:16.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a fascinating story, Rick.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:17.600 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for being on the show.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Thank you, Emery.

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith,
and this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:23.560 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
