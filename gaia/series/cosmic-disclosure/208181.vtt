00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on Cosmic Disclosure,
we're at an undisclosed

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.730 align:middle line:10%
location with Tim.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.360 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in the
covert governance in Germany,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.439 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies in relation

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.950 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial groups
in contact with Earth.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.855 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:37.855 --> 00:00:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for having me.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, you referred to humanity
as a time-traveling species.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.690 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The theoretical physics
exists since the 1920s.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Around that time, they
found out that there's

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.550 align:middle line:84%
some fluidity to time
and that it could also

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.130 align:middle line:90%
work as a dimension.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:84%
That path the way, so to
speak, for time traveling,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.020 align:middle line:90%
for moving through time.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:84%
So the Germans did have
experiments on that.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm not privy if
they were successful,

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:90%
and I doubt it strongly.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I think that they found a lot
of technology and had some help,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.420 align:middle line:84%
but they did not
succeed on time travel,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.240 align:middle line:84%
to make it as
stable as it should

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.840 align:middle line:84%
be to put a biological
being through some portal

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.740 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.360 align:middle line:90%
But there were experiments.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And there were also
experiments with particles

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:58.750 align:middle line:84%
and smaller objects who were
successful in the '70s, '80s.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And making humanity a
time-traveling species

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:90%
is something that is pretty new.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Like we're talking about
10, 20 years at max.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So the technology
actually, at least

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.230 align:middle line:84%
the technology I am aware
of, comes from the Greys

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.860 align:middle line:84%
because they are a
time-traveling species.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And I need to add that time
travel technology seems

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.340 align:middle line:84%
to be something that only
a very, very small group

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.300 align:middle line:90%
of people has access to.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not in the mainstream.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's also nothing
that countries regularly

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.630 align:middle line:84%
seem to have access to,
only very limited access.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:84%
While a lot of races have
been given or developed

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.470 align:middle line:84%
some kind of propulsion
system in order

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.890 align:middle line:84%
to move upon their planet
or move away off planet,

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.880 align:middle line:84%
traveling through time, as
it makes a lot of turbulence

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.260 align:middle line:84%
and distortion to
the timeline itself,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.850 align:middle line:84%
is something that is very
exclusive and very rare

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:84%
to find in a stable
technology whilst development.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Who are the beings
influencing timelines?

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I basically know of two
three-dimensional beings that

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.920 align:middle line:90%
have the time travel technology.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.930 align:middle line:84%
I know that there
are more than that.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there
has been more influence

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:03.010 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth timelines
than just from two species.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.840 align:middle line:84%
But personally, so to speak,
I know only two species

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.460 align:middle line:90%
that did that.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And the one reptilian species
we we're talking about

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.690 align:middle line:84%
and the Greys do have
that as a technology.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Other beings that have developed
a more spiritual approach

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:84%
to time travel,
they can also move

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.230 align:middle line:84%
through time, which means
that they use their connection

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.390 align:middle line:84%
to the interconnectivity
of the universe

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.660 align:middle line:84%
in order to shift
their consciousness

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.610 align:middle line:84%
from one point and one
dimension into another point,

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.030 align:middle line:84%
into another dimension,
which can be time.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:84%
But that also means that
moving objects, moving crafts,

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:84%
technology, or even a body
is something that cannot be

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.085 align:middle line:90%
maintained.

00:05:04.085 --> 00:05:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>> You know two types of
beings who use time travel.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And now, you're saying
humans have that ability.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.910 align:middle line:84%
With all the chaos and
divisiveness on Earth,

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.640 align:middle line:84%
how can humans be
trusted at time travel?

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, to my
understanding, there's a very,

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.730 align:middle line:84%
very limited access
to the technology.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:84%
The algorithms and
calculations that

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.260 align:middle line:84%
have to be done in
order to alter time

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.050 align:middle line:84%
and in order to influence
and effect timelines

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.470 align:middle line:84%
are very complicated
and very dangerous.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.300 align:middle line:84%
So to my knowledge,
there's only one group

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.260 align:middle line:84%
that is accessing
this technology that

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.640 align:middle line:90%
comes from the Greys.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty sure
that the Greys have

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.980 align:middle line:90%
some kind of oversight on that.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And the good thing about that is
that these beings or let me say

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:12.780 align:middle line:84%
this group that builds this
time unit is reaching out

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:84%
from a future
version of the Earth

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:23.550 align:middle line:84%
in order to prevent chaos in
the recent timeline, which

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
is pretty assuring, a good
and healthy evolution.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the Greys
saw that because as we know,

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:39.210 align:middle line:84%
the Greys, they
put a lot of effort

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.870 align:middle line:84%
into the communication
with human people.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.260 align:middle line:84%
They appeared a
lot to individuals,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.420 align:middle line:84%
were warning them about
humans destroying the planet.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And they were appearing
inside of nuclear facilities

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and researching how to shut down
nuclear bombs because they have

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.180 align:middle line:84%
seen more than
one time the Earth

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.950 align:middle line:84%
being destroyed by A,
outside technology,

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.040 align:middle line:90%
or B, inside technology.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And because giving technology
to human groups, to governments

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.790 align:middle line:84%
wasn't successful in order
to change the kind of mindset

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and the moral ethical
standpoint of governments.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.550 align:middle line:84%
They needed to be directly
showing the consequences

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:41.350 align:middle line:84%
because that is something
human beings react upon.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.130 align:middle line:84%
When there is a
direct catalyst that

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:84%
is so heavy and
directly experienceable,

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.090 align:middle line:84%
they move or shift
their awareness.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And because the Greys
did a lot of effort

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:58.150 align:middle line:84%
in order to repair
certain timelines in order

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:05.620 align:middle line:84%
to save their material and save
the development of the Earth,

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.800 align:middle line:84%
at one point, they
decided to at least show

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:14.620 align:middle line:84%
to a very unique and
special group of people

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:19.250 align:middle line:84%
what the actual consequences
can be in the future.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And that is one
very heavy reason

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.030 align:middle line:84%
why we now have all
this disclosure going on

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:30.830 align:middle line:84%
because knowing the
consequences makes

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.780 align:middle line:84%
you have a different
perspective on what's going on.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you alluding to some
event that they're trying

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.419 align:middle line:84%
to shift right now that
could be catastrophic?

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:84%
>> To my knowledge, we had a
lot of potential catastrophes

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:48.340 align:middle line:84%
occurring in different
timelines on the Earth.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Having terrible,
terrible output,

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
which the Greys
corrected in order

00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:01.180 align:middle line:84%
to have this kind of correct
evolvement of the planet.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.120 align:middle line:84%
I am aware that
there right now are

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:12.280 align:middle line:84%
people from the future on Earth
assisting with this process.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it the people from the
future or ETs who are helping

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.710 align:middle line:90%
with this process?

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The thought of having
a linear time signature,

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:29.920 align:middle line:84%
linear timeline is pretty
special to the dualistic

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.390 align:middle line:90%
thinking of humans.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:36.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
make that difference,

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.540 align:middle line:84%
I would say that only humans
fall under that category

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.580 align:middle line:84%
because if you're
talking about the Greys

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.220 align:middle line:84%
as the time-traveling
species, they

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.770 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't say they
come from the future

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.340 align:middle line:84%
because as they travel through
all those dimensions pretty

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:84%
fluently, they do
not define themselves

00:09:55.810 --> 00:10:01.150 align:middle line:84%
as futuristic beings
or present beings.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.450 align:middle line:90%
They just are beings.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>> How far in the future
are they coming from when

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
these human beings?

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we're not talking
about a too large number.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:18.190 align:middle line:84%
We're pretty much having
kind of baby steps

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:20.750 align:middle line:90%
and to a possible future.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:26.260 align:middle line:84%
So I would suggest that we
have about 50 to 70 years

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:33.640 align:middle line:84%
in the future, which seems
to be a small number,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.750 align:middle line:84%
but which means a lot in
terms of correcting timelines

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:43.090 align:middle line:84%
and also in terms of technology,
and wisdom, and knowledge,

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:44.830 align:middle line:90%
and connectivity.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Falco from the Damanhur
Federation said that he time

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.870 align:middle line:84%
travelled to the past to make a
small change that would affect

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.300 align:middle line:84%
a significant event around
the same time you're speaking

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.100 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:90%
What do you know about that?

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>> I have heard about Damanhur.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:07.800 align:middle line:84%
I've also heard that they are
using natural portals in order

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:13.380 align:middle line:84%
to move through time and using
natural-occurring temporal

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.640 align:middle line:90%
dynamics.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.080 align:middle line:90%
And that is a thing.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:90%
So I've not been there.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.840 align:middle line:90%
Maybe sometime in the future.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.790 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:29.830 align:middle line:84%
But naturally occurring
temporal dynamics are a thing.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And they happen randomly
at certain places,

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.830 align:middle line:90%
at certain times.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:37.730 align:middle line:90%
They are pretty rare.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.280 align:middle line:90%
But it can happen.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's also
theoretically in physics

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:50.680 align:middle line:84%
and proven that they do happen
where for example, something

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.150 align:middle line:84%
could move into a
temporal dimension.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:12:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's just gone from this
time and appears somewhere els.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you describe the
different timelines that you

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:90%
know about?

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
millions, and millions,

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and millions of timelines that
are potentially there or have

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:21.240 align:middle line:84%
happened and broken
away or something.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.120 align:middle line:90%
So it's a huge question.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:29.850 align:middle line:84%
But there is knowledge about
how to do the calculations

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:34.740 align:middle line:84%
on shifting from one timeline
into the other timeline.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.360 align:middle line:90%


00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And there are like
thousands or billion

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.970 align:middle line:84%
probably, an infinite number
of potential timelines

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:51.130 align:middle line:84%
that have happened in the past,
failed and got reintegrated

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:55.120 align:middle line:84%
into the main time
string that we have.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is stable
and successful.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you're asking me
about one specific and maybe

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:12.790 align:middle line:84%
important alternative timeline
that is happening right now.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:19.600 align:middle line:84%
But not everyone on Earth will
experience, for example, aliens

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.460 align:middle line:90%
or non-terrestrials.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:27.520 align:middle line:84%
There are people that have taken
the decision to not experience

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.500 align:middle line:90%
non-terrestrial beings.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And that, by their free
will, they will not.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.660 align:middle line:84%
But those beings, those persons
that have taken this decision

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.900 align:middle line:84%
are not on this
timeline right now,

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.630 align:middle line:84%
where everyone is
watching this program.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone who
is watching this right

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.790 align:middle line:84%
now will be on
the timeline where

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:58.780 align:middle line:84%
UFOs or UAPs and foreign
species will be a thing.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Which also means that some kind
of negotiation, and trading,

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and all those things
that come with challenges

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:90%
will also be a thing.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:21.590 align:middle line:84%
There is a timeline that is
more harmonious than the one we

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.290 align:middle line:90%
are on.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:84%
It's timeline where those
main player characters or CUs,

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.100 align:middle line:84%
consciousness units or people,
whatever you want to call them,

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:39.120 align:middle line:84%
they have decided that they want
to be in harmony with everyone.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.290 align:middle line:90%
Right now, there are challenges.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.620 align:middle line:84%
There are things that
need to be ruled out.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.970 align:middle line:84%
There are things that
need to find a way.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's a more
sensitive timeline

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:55.420 align:middle line:90%
that will eventually succeed.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>> How will this
shift take place,

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.850 align:middle line:84%
where you have some people
who will move to a different

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.760 align:middle line:84%
for sequential timeline
and a new world,

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.780 align:middle line:84%
versus the people who are
resistant and close-minded.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a huge number of
possibilities to answer that

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:11.730 align:middle line:90%
question.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:15.780 align:middle line:84%
But I will reduce
it to only three.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Those people who have
figured out and by their sole

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:28.290 align:middle line:84%
development decided that they
will not enter a universe where

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:36.420 align:middle line:84%
exopolitics are a thing,
those have left the planet

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:40.290 align:middle line:84%
about, I don't know, three,
four, five years ago.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:44.970 align:middle line:84%
They can still appear in your
life as some version of them,

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:50.520 align:middle line:84%
but the consciousness, the
observer version of them

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.500 align:middle line:90%
is in a different timeline.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.620 align:middle line:84%
You might find that
some people in your life

00:15:55.620 --> 00:16:00.060 align:middle line:84%
have made a drastical
change in their appearance

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:90%
or in their way of behavior.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.720 align:middle line:84%
That might be in
evidence, or a clue,

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:12.810 align:middle line:84%
or an indicator for that
person to have shifted

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:17.010 align:middle line:84%
his or her observary
point to another timeline

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and experiencing something
else that is also stable.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
all those timelines

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:29.550 align:middle line:84%
that are now splitting up will
return to the main time strain

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.540 align:middle line:90%
in the midst of the universe.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:38.910 align:middle line:84%
All those different realities
that are appearing are stable.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:43.710 align:middle line:84%
The one with the non-terrestrial
beings, the UAPs, UFOs,

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Pentagon, and Earth shift, those
are stable realities, just as

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:58.140 align:middle line:84%
the one that have a form
of unification factor.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:03.300 align:middle line:84%
For example, there is a timeline
that is parallel to this one,

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:09.890 align:middle line:84%
where the Earth
decided on activating

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:13.460 align:middle line:84%
a unified field of
consciousness, which

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:18.680 align:middle line:84%
means the individual factor
of every consciousness unit

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:23.540 align:middle line:84%
will merge into a
higher consciousness

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:27.859 align:middle line:84%
of a planetary awareness that
is happening somewhere else

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:30.560 align:middle line:84%
parallel to what we
experience right now.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.720 align:middle line:84%
This is a very stable
timeline because that

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:84%
means that everyone is kind
of giving up their ego,

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.640 align:middle line:84%
giving up their part
of the individuality

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:49.370 align:middle line:84%
in order to make Earth
very, very stable.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.430 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
unsolved problems

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of challenges that
comes with this version, which

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.670 align:middle line:90%
means we have exopolitics.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle line:84%
We have politics on
Earth, domestic politics.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:10.100 align:middle line:84%
We have to find out how to move
into a peaceful universe, which

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:14.690 align:middle line:84%
means negotiation, which
means we need to get along

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.910 align:middle line:90%
with our galactic family.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:21.590 align:middle line:84%
But as you know, family
also means controversy.

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:24.740 align:middle line:90%
It means conflict at times.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:29.660 align:middle line:84%
That makes this timeline
a little more challenging.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And that makes other
more stable timelines

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.010 align:middle line:84%
focus more on this
brother or sister timeline

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.800 align:middle line:84%
in order to move it
carefully into another spot.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>> When were timelines
first manipulated?

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So the first attempts of
changing timelines I am aware

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:55.760 align:middle line:84%
of is probably 15,000 years
ago because that was one

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.990 align:middle line:84%
of the heavier
cataclysts that appeared.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Where before that, we have
a lot of loose timelines

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.210 align:middle line:90%
that got integrated.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.570 align:middle line:84%
So if at that
point, the universe

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:18.060 align:middle line:84%
had has certain points
where it kind of saves

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:22.350 align:middle line:84%
the backup of a timeline, puts
every failed timeline together,

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and creates
something emerges it.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:29.520 align:middle line:84%
If we go further back
than 15,000 years,

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.890 align:middle line:84%
then you have
different timelines

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.870 align:middle line:84%
that would be merged
anyway to this timeline.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So the best opportunity
for anybody,

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:41.130 align:middle line:84%
if you want to change
the current timeline,

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.220 align:middle line:90%
would be around 15,000 years.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned the
installation was integrated

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.940 align:middle line:90%
15,000 years ago.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Is there a connection
with that and what

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.990 align:middle line:90%
you're speaking about now?

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:57.570 align:middle line:84%
The first influences
and the first appearance

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:04.320 align:middle line:84%
of distortion of humanity
is about 15,000 years ago

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:14.430 align:middle line:84%
with people building up
elites and invasive structures

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:19.380 align:middle line:84%
and being in conflict
with each other.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.110 align:middle line:84%
At that time, it
was more or less

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.020 align:middle line:84%
like a satellite
war, which means

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:30.480 align:middle line:84%
that you have two
opponents that use

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.180 align:middle line:84%
another geostrategic
situation in order

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:39.020 align:middle line:90%
to rule out a conflict.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And the more evolved
humans became,

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.990 align:middle line:90%
the more they intermingled.

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:90%
And genetics merged.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:59.900 align:middle line:84%
The more it became a conflict
and a chaos on planet Earth.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:08.070 align:middle line:84%
That became a direct location
of conflict in the universe.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>> What concerns do you have
for the timeline humanity is

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.460 align:middle line:90%
in right now?

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't have any concerns.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:19.070 align:middle line:84%
I only have hopes
about this timeline.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Because eventually, and I know
that it is a stable timeline,

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:29.860 align:middle line:90%
so it will eventually succeed.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:35.570 align:middle line:84%
But as always, time
means that memory

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:40.130 align:middle line:84%
moves its way through
what we could call time

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:41.660 align:middle line:90%
through dimension.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And on that way of memory,
we will find challenges.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And we find conflicts,
potential conflicts.

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to us, it's up
to every responsible unit

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:00.290 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
in order to help

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:03.140 align:middle line:90%
in stabilizing this timeline.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:10.430 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of help, a lot of
influence from outside of time.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:16.790 align:middle line:84%
We have beings that oversee
the orientation of the vector

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:90%
of time, which is great.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:26.130 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of means that
we can relax and be sure

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.710 align:middle line:90%
that this will work out.

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.290 align:middle line:84%
It still means we
are responsible,

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and we need to be aware of what
we put out into the universe.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:40.380 align:middle line:84%
It is on us to be responsible,
and to be healthy and positive

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.760 align:middle line:84%
beings, and to create
and project out

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.720 align:middle line:84%
good, peaceful, and harmonious
energy into the world.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any species
in opposition of positively

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:90%
influencing our timeline?

00:22:54.040 --> 00:23:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Look, the Earth had some time
in order to solve their greed,

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and conflicts, and
problems on their own.

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.190 align:middle line:90%


00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:11.990 align:middle line:84%
The universe in this version
of reality and in this timeline

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:15.320 align:middle line:84%
didn't quite make
it to a point where

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:23.210 align:middle line:84%
the Earth is homogeneous,
peaceful, and productive enough

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:27.620 align:middle line:90%
to help themselves.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:31.340 align:middle line:84%
That is why the universe
for this timeline

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:36.050 align:middle line:84%
has decided to go outside,
to bring diversity

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:42.530 align:middle line:84%
and other realities densed
together in order to find best

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:47.750 align:middle line:84%
practice, mathematical
solutions for the challenges

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:51.320 align:middle line:84%
that occur on this Earth,
which brings the higher

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.950 align:middle line:84%
probability to the
solution of the problems

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.310 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth has
experienced in the past.

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:04.760 align:middle line:84%
But it also brings a higher
scale of problems with it.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.995 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say precise
mathematical solutions,

00:24:07.995 --> 00:24:11.590 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like an IT engineer
writing code to get a specific

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:12.640 align:middle line:90%
outcome.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.520 align:middle line:90%
Are we a result of some code?

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Depends on the perspective.

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:24.460 align:middle line:84%
If I was talking to an AI
being, then they would say yes.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:29.320 align:middle line:84%
If I'm talking to a biology
or a biological being,

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.200 align:middle line:90%
then they would say no.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.510 align:middle line:84%
If I would talk to a
yogi, they would say

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:middle line:90%
karma and dharma is the same.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:44.740 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to the best as we
all understand the universe,

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:49.790 align:middle line:84%
the universe has some kind
of natural dynamics to it.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.250 align:middle line:90%
You might want to call it code.

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:52.990 align:middle line:90%
You can call it communication.

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.320 align:middle line:84%
You can call it a
mental thought system.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:02.710 align:middle line:84%
But the universe is producing
some kind of reality.

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it finds some kind
of algorithm to problems.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:15.100 align:middle line:84%
You might find
different terms to that,

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.590 align:middle line:90%
but it's the same phenomenon.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, are we all existing
on different timelines,

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.380 align:middle line:84%
or do we simply
exist on this one?

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>> We are everything.

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:29.490 align:middle line:90%
We are awareness.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And we are experiencing
this reality

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:42.130 align:middle line:84%
depending on where we put
our observatorial state.

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So if I am looking
through these eyes

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and experiencing this
room, then I probably

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:53.350 align:middle line:84%
consciously and willingly
decide to be here.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:57.400 align:middle line:84%
But I could also or
the universe could also

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:90%
take a different take.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Everyone could decide
to be somewhere else

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:07.520 align:middle line:84%
and watch them themselves
and to play there.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:12.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you're asking, do we
exist in different timelines,

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:17.320 align:middle line:84%
a version of us might exist
in a different timeline.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:23.110 align:middle line:84%
But if we consciously decide or
our soul consciously decides,

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:27.100 align:middle line:84%
which means a
super-consciousness system,

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:32.530 align:middle line:84%
which kicks in as long as
the consciousness needs to be

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:37.350 align:middle line:90%
self-aware and self-willing.

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:41.760 align:middle line:84%
As long as we decide
to be here, we're here.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>> In a parallel
universe and timeline,

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.400 align:middle line:84%
is that a version of Tim and
his soul moving through that,

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.030 align:middle line:90%
or just in this timeline?

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>> For example, the
double slit experiment.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:27:01.050 align:middle line:84%
So once the particle has
decided where it is located,

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.770 align:middle line:90%
it is there.

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:09.080 align:middle line:84%
You can, at some point
for a theoretical second,

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.640 align:middle line:84%
be at two points in the
universe at the same time.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:19.700 align:middle line:84%
But something or
someone has to decide

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:26.700 align:middle line:84%
where you are located as
long as we have this observer

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:33.240 align:middle line:84%
individual status that
people on Earth are used to.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>> You talked about us
and a shift happening now,

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.990 align:middle line:84%
but what about the closed
minded people not participating?

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:43.960 align:middle line:84%
What will happen to them,
and where do they go?

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we are talking about
those units of consciousness

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:54.510 align:middle line:84%
that have either not
developed a soul yet,

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:58.500 align:middle line:84%
or not developed
a state of mind,

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:02.970 align:middle line:84%
where they willingly decide for
their own where they are going,

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:09.000 align:middle line:84%
or a soul that comes in
consequence decides for them,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.640 align:middle line:84%
they will become
a failed timeline.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Which means their consciousness
will be in some other state

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:20.550 align:middle line:84%
where they can't have the
opportunity, the probabilities

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:26.650 align:middle line:84%
to learn either to decide for
themselves or develop a soul.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:31.410 align:middle line:84%
But if we are talking
about mindful beings that

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:35.940 align:middle line:84%
have decided to
not be in contact

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.750 align:middle line:84%
with non-terrestrial
beings and have decided

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:49.050 align:middle line:84%
to be in a denser, unified
state of awareness,

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:56.930 align:middle line:84%
they're willing decision is to
observe and to experience that

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:59.840 align:middle line:84%
as long as we are
here and as long

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:06.080 align:middle line:84%
as we are still experiencing
a dualistic worldview,

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.200 align:middle line:84%
where we're having
this experience.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And the illusion that
it's not one source that

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.800 align:middle line:90%
is talking to itself.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:22.200 align:middle line:84%
We have other beings,
3D beings, that

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:28.290 align:middle line:84%
also identify as individual
consciousness units that

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:33.780 align:middle line:84%
will interact with us and
have also decided to be here.

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Where did you get the term
consciousness unit rather than

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.970 align:middle line:90%
just saying human beings?

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:44.640 align:middle line:84%
It's just a term that
somebody came up with.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.780 align:middle line:84%
It's just like the observeral
status or something,

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:54.090 align:middle line:84%
some technical term, that
makes it pretty clear

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:59.122 align:middle line:84%
that we're not talking
about, I don't know--

00:29:59.122 --> 00:30:04.820 align:middle line:84%
it's a technical term, which is
in use, and I use it as well.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, that was
very informative.

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm Emery Smith, and this
is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.520 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on Cosmic Disclosure.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>> There are forces overseeing
timelines, securing timelines,

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:27.760 align:middle line:84%
so that everything
will turn out fine.

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:34.900 align:middle line:84%
There is a version of this
recent planet Earth that

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.970 align:middle line:90%
is somewhere in the future.

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Are the interviews and
answers you're giving right now

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.470 align:middle line:90%
affecting people in the future?

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:55.000 align:middle line:90%
