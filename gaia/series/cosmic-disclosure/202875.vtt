>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with Richard Doty,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:10%
a retired counterintelligence
agent who served in the Air

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:10%
Force Office of
Special Investigations.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately involved
with UFO/ET-related content.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.970 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Richard.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:32.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, we are discussing
the Eben transport craft.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.900 align:middle line:84%
What do we know about them,
and how do we know about them?

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in 1947, two crafts
crashed over New Mexico.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And one landed near
Corona, New Mexico,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and one landed west of
Magdalena, New Mexico.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.680 align:middle line:84%
The crash site at Corona
was found relatively soon

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.860 align:middle line:84%
after the crash, and
we recovered a crash

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.730 align:middle line:84%
in an intact
extraterrestrial craft.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And two years later,
in 1949, a rancher

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:84%
located the second
craft that crashed.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.070 align:middle line:84%
So we had two extraterrestrial
crafts in our possession

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.620 align:middle line:84%
that we studied and
experimented on over the years.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Are we referring
to the Roswell crash?

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we are.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:84%
The actual crash that
occurred in 1947--

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.110 align:middle line:84%
one of the crafts landed south
of Corona, New Mexico, which

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:84%
is about 60 miles
north of Roswell.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Everyone refers to
it as a Roswell crash

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.840 align:middle line:84%
because the craft itself
and the occupants were

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.930 align:middle line:84%
taken to Walker Army Airfield,
which was in Roswell,

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.650 align:middle line:84%
so they refer to it
as a Roswell crash.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.280 align:middle line:84%
But the official
government documents

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.900 align:middle line:84%
show that the craft landed
closer to Corona, New Mexico,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.620 align:middle line:84%
than to Roswell, and that's why
people within the government

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.950 align:middle line:84%
refer to it as the Corona
crash, not the Roswell crash.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.610 align:middle line:84%
As we understand,
in June of 1947,

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.770 align:middle line:84%
two extraterrestrial crafts
were flying over New Mexico,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.140 align:middle line:84%
right in a lightning
storm, electrical storm.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, and I don't know that
we know or anyone figured it

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.740 align:middle line:90%
out, but they crashed.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, in the pop
culture, allegedly,

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:84%
they talk about online that
these craft were knocked down

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:84%
by our radar systems
and had a malfunction.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know that our
government ever proved that one

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.910 align:middle line:84%
way or the other, but that
was a theory by the US Army

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.780 align:middle line:84%
scientists that investigated
it, investigated why these two

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.870 align:middle line:90%
crafts crashed.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, we captured
or we recovered a being

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.980 align:middle line:84%
from the Corona crash, but
it took some time for him

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:84%
to explain to us
exactly what happened.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.190 align:middle line:84%
The only thing he told
us was both crafts

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.550 align:middle line:84%
hit, struck, or collided
with each other.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And one landed in Corona, and
one landed out in Horse Mesa.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>> How much damage did that
craft in Corona sustain?

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Did it look very damaged when
you saw these photographs?

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>> There was no damage at all.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle line:90%
That's the surprising thing.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.190 align:middle line:84%
What our scientists
figured out and, I think,

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:90%
what EBE told us--

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.060 align:middle line:84%
although I was never
actually privy to what

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.320 align:middle line:90%
he said about that.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.570 align:middle line:84%
But other scientists told
me, and it's in a document

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.230 align:middle line:84%
that there were components
after it crashed together,

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.850 align:middle line:90%
after they collided in air--

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.510 align:middle line:84%
there were components within
the craft that shut off,

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.860 align:middle line:90%
and that's why it crashed.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Because the environmental
system went out,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.020 align:middle line:90%
the impact killed the four.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So it wasn't from blunt
trauma from the crew members

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.340 align:middle line:90%
because they died.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.230 align:middle line:84%
It was because of the
environmental system.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, and same way with
the craft in Horse Mesa.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.460 align:middle line:90%
It crashed.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.992 align:middle line:90%
The systems went out.

00:04:07.992 --> 00:04:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Environmental system went out,
and that's what killed them.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Were they wearing any type
of suits or protective clothing?

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.269 align:middle line:84%
>> They had a tight-fitting
similar to a flight suit, very,

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.339 align:middle line:90%
very tight fitting.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And they had some objects
on their suits that--

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.770 align:middle line:90%
I saw the pictures of it.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know that
those items were ever

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:84%
discussed of what they were,
whether some kind of a safety

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.040 align:middle line:84%
mechanism or something
to that effect.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Did either one ever explain
what they were doing here

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.910 align:middle line:90%
or any intel on that?

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, eventually, he
explained that they were

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.520 align:middle line:84%
on an exploratory
mission of our planet,

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.850 align:middle line:84%
and they had been visiting
our planet for years and years

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.620 align:middle line:90%
and years, hundreds of years.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And they came back to
examine our planet,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.560 align:middle line:84%
but according to
EBE, they had only

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.270 align:middle line:84%
been in our atmosphere
for just a few days

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.890 align:middle line:90%
when the crash occurred.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And where were
they keeping EBE-1?

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>> At Los Alamos.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.290 align:middle line:84%
He was found-- and we say "he"
because we know it was a male.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.650 align:middle line:84%
When he was found
in the Corona crash,

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.700 align:middle line:84%
he was initially taken
to Sandia Base, which

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.350 align:middle line:90%
is now Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.140 align:middle line:84%
He was examined
by our physicians,

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and then they had to find
a secure location for him.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.310 align:middle line:84%
The most secure location
probably in the world in 1947

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:90%
was Los Alamos Laboratories.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Did they have a
special facility, also,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.130 align:middle line:84%
for this being that was
adapted to this atmosphere?

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>> According to official
documents I read and the film

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.720 align:middle line:84%
that I saw, EBE-1 was first
transported to Kirtland Air

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.610 align:middle line:90%
Force Base.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:90%
We'll go back a little bit.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.070 align:middle line:84%
The Army personnel who
found him at the crash site

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.540 align:middle line:84%
wasn't sure of how
to communicate.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.600 align:middle line:84%
He didn't obviously
speak English.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.820 align:middle line:90%
They didn't speak his language.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.210 align:middle line:84%
They weren't sure who
he was or what he was,

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.860 align:middle line:84%
but they treated
him with respect.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:84%
They placed him in an
ambulance and transported him

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.750 align:middle line:90%
to Sandia Base.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Once at Sandia Base,
military physicians,

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.220 align:middle line:90%
Army physicians examined him.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing they
said was, he's not human,

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:90%
and they couldn't communicate.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.170 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any way for the
two of them to communicate.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:32.590 align:middle line:84%
They did use sign languages,
pictures of different things

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:84%
that he somehow related,
but the most important thing

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.340 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to
get through to him

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.320 align:middle line:90%
was, we're not here to harm you.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.910 align:middle line:84%
We're not here to harm
you, and he sensed that.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.780 align:middle line:84%
As he related later,
he sensed that nobody

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.580 align:middle line:84%
was going to hurt him, or they
would have already hurt him.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.140 align:middle line:84%
He was more concerned
with his crew members,

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.980 align:middle line:84%
who all died in
the crash and what

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.800 align:middle line:84%
happened to them, because I
don't believe at the time,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.610 align:middle line:84%
EBE knew that the other
four occupants were dead.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.640 align:middle line:90%
So he was very concerned.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, there was an
Air Force intelligence officer

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.820 align:middle line:84%
that was placed with
him or his handler,

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:25.540 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, and during the
time frame of 1947 to 1949,

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.180 align:middle line:90%
the two of them connected.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:84%
This Air Force captain
lived with EBE,

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:84%
lived in the same facility,
which was at Los Alamos.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.620 align:middle line:84%
They built a special
facility for EBE.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And when they used
the word "EBE," it's

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrial
Biological Entity,

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.890 align:middle line:90%
and that's why they used "EBE."

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.260 align:middle line:84%
They had to determine
whether he could

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.860 align:middle line:84%
breathe our air, whether there
was too much oxygen in the air.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Initially, they found
that the 20% or 22%

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.350 align:middle line:84%
oxygen that's in our air was
a little bit too much for him.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.310 align:middle line:84%
They manufactured a facility
with somewhere between 17%

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.270 align:middle line:84%
and 19% oxygen, but eventually,
over a period of time,

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.410 align:middle line:84%
he adjusted to our atmosphere
and the oxygen level

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:90%
within our atmosphere.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.130 align:middle line:84%
In 1950, an Army
physician figured out

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:24.940 align:middle line:84%
a way to plant a device in
EBE's throat so he could speak.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.100 align:middle line:90%
He could pronounce things.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Before that, EBE could make
sounds, screeching sounds,

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.820 align:middle line:84%
which was their language,
but we obviously

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.169 align:middle line:90%
couldn't understand it.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:37.419 align:middle line:84%
EBE tried to teach
us his language.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:40.990 align:middle line:84%
He even wrote down
his characters.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.840 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
letters, per se.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.000 align:middle line:84%
They had characters
similar to Chinese.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.240 align:middle line:84%
They had characters, and each
character meant something.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.352 align:middle line:90%
I think there was 160-some.

00:08:51.352 --> 00:08:52.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
the exact number--

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.580 align:middle line:90%
160 characters.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.450 align:middle line:90%
He wrote them all down.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:57.430 align:middle line:90%
He knew how to write.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.160 align:middle line:84%
He wrote them all
down, and then we

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.620 align:middle line:84%
had to try to
learn these things.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:84%
But in 1950, when his
voice box was activated,

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.770 align:middle line:90%
he could say words.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:11.710 align:middle line:84%
There were sometimes
difficult to understand,

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.960 align:middle line:84%
but he quickly
learned our language.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was over a
period of months,

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.120 align:middle line:84%
but you got to remember, he
had been hearing our language

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.790 align:middle line:90%
since 1947.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.460 align:middle line:84%
But in the 1950s, he
was putting that all

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.910 align:middle line:84%
together because his
brain was so advanced.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.040 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
about his brain--

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.750 align:middle line:90%
they have 20-some lobes.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.840 align:middle line:90%
Each lobe had a certain--

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.400 align:middle line:84%
when they did a scan or
an X-ray of his head,

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.930 align:middle line:84%
they noticed there was
brightness in different lobes

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.650 align:middle line:84%
when they did certain
things to him.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:50.920 align:middle line:84%
So over 20 lobes were doing
things to control his brain,

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.010 align:middle line:84%
so that meant he was so
far advanced than us.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:54.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.470 align:middle line:90%
What did EBE-1 look like?

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.540 align:middle line:90%
What was the body somatotype?

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>> He was about 4-foot 5.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:05.020 align:middle line:84%
He had large eyes, a large
head, very large brain.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.300 align:middle line:84%
He had little openings for
ears on each side of us

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:12.370 align:middle line:84%
had, some little openings for a
nose, and mouth with no teeth.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.730 align:middle line:84%
The internal organs--
he had one organ that

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.590 align:middle line:90%
worked as a heart and lung.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have separate
lungs or a separate heart.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:26.950 align:middle line:84%
He had a very simplified, as a
doctor said, digestive system.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.710 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't eat our food,
couldn't eat all our food,

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.900 align:middle line:84%
but eventually, over
a period of time--

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:36.220 align:middle line:84%
he had food in the craft, which
they later recovered for him.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're pellets, that
he would eat these pellets.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And they would melt. As soon
as they got into his mouth,

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:90%
they would melt.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's another thing the
doctors couldn't understand.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.040 align:middle line:90%
We tried them.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.070 align:middle line:90%
They didn't melt in our mouth--

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:56.620 align:middle line:84%
something about the saliva
or the enzymes in EBE's mouth

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.710 align:middle line:84%
that immediately reacted
with these food pellets.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:84%
But he survived on
these food pellets,

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.780 align:middle line:90%
but eventually, they ran out.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And now they had to figure out
what kind of food he could eat,

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.370 align:middle line:90%
and they did.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:84%
They found vegetables,
certain types of vegetables.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember the
vegetables, but there

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.560 align:middle line:84%
were certain
vegetables and fruit

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.840 align:middle line:84%
that he could eat
and could survive on.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And he could survive
on our water.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:27.910 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, he
succumbed to something,

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:33.040 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not sure, in 1952 when
he died, they figured out why.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, online, they
have a lot of these videos

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:41.560 align:middle line:84%
of an extraterrestrial being
interrogated or the one they

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.450 align:middle line:90%
call Skinny Bob.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Are these the Ebens
we're talking about?

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:10%
>> I can't vouch for all
those videos that are

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:54.640 align:middle line:10%
on the internet, but the one
video, black-and-white video,

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.470 align:middle line:10%
supposedly taken inside the
Soviet Union back years ago

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.810 align:middle line:10%
showing a being
with a large head,

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.620 align:middle line:10%
that looks similar to an Eben.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.570 align:middle line:84%
That is probably
the most accurate

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.050 align:middle line:84%
that's out there,
the Skinny Bob one.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us about this
Eben transport craft.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.665 align:middle line:84%
What were the
characteristics of it?

00:12:14.665 --> 00:12:17.050 align:middle line:84%
What's the technological
aspects of it?

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we recovered it, and
we transported it to Los Alamos.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was like our scientists
getting a chunk of metal

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:84%
that they had no
idea what it was.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.140 align:middle line:84%
They knew it was some
kind of a flying craft.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.210 align:middle line:84%
They knew it was
a transport craft.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:39.310 align:middle line:84%
EBE would go in and show them
different things in the craft,

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.920 align:middle line:84%
but at that time period,
he couldn't speak.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, he couldn't
explain what it was,

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.140 align:middle line:90%
but he was using pictures.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And he was using
hand gestures to try

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:54.820 align:middle line:84%
to explain to them what
each item within the craft--

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.450 align:middle line:90%
what each component was.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:01.120 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the environmental
system within the craft--

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.280 align:middle line:84%
he showed them the
environmental system,

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and he placed his hand over his
face as if to say, we breathe.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.700 align:middle line:90%
We breathe.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, the scientists
saw, examined it,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.790 align:middle line:84%
but had no idea how the
environmental system worked

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.800 align:middle line:90%
within that Eben craft.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.320 align:middle line:84%
But he also showed them
the propulsion system.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.390 align:middle line:84%
He showed them other things,
but at that time period,

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:24.490 align:middle line:90%
he couldn't speak.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.340 align:middle line:84%
We knew it was some type
of propulsion system,

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:33.310 align:middle line:84%
but our technology in the late
'40s and '50s wasn't advanced.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So these scientists had no
idea how these things worked.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.510 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, as our
technology advanced,

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.810 align:middle line:84%
they started understanding a
little bit more of the craft.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, EBE-1 had died, so
they didn't have him.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:84%
But they started doing
experiments on the craft,

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.430 align:middle line:84%
and they started figuring out
that the exterior of the craft

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:58.210 align:middle line:84%
had charges, different types
of charges, electrical charges.

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:00.730 align:middle line:84%
They also figured
out that the craft

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.370 align:middle line:90%
had three distinct layers.

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:10.440 align:middle line:84%
The center layer of this
craft, of the material, moved.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.570 align:middle line:90%
They could get it to move.

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.140 align:middle line:84%
It was constantly moving
when the craft was in flight.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.330 align:middle line:84%
They didn't understand
how it moved,

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:84%
or they didn't
understand why it moved.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.470 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things they
did find, when it was moving,

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.520 align:middle line:84%
it created gravity
inside the craft,

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and it also did something
on the outside of the craft.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:84%
It caused the
energy displacement,

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:41.460 align:middle line:84%
which affected our air and
allowed a void to form,

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:47.530 align:middle line:84%
so they could move through
our atmosphere, at least

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:50.010 align:middle line:84%
in our atmosphere
close to Earth,

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:52.470 align:middle line:90%
easier than we could ever move.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.390 align:middle line:84%
But again, the
scientists just couldn't

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:57.285 align:middle line:90%
understand how this worked.

00:14:57.285 --> 00:14:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Was there a sound to it?

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Did you hear anything?

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a
small wuffle sound.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.690 align:middle line:90%
It's just a small wuffle sound.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.100 align:middle line:90%
And I've only seen--

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I never saw it
actually in working.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:84%
I saw pictures, and
I saw a video of it.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to the
scientists that worked on it.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.570 align:middle line:84%
I think the guy
that actually saw

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:19.980 align:middle line:90%
it operate once was Bob Lazar.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.530 align:middle line:84%
He mentioned some of
these same things.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.420 align:middle line:84%
But there's a
document out there,

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and the document explains
exactly what the Los Alamos

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.670 align:middle line:84%
National Laboratories
figured out about this craft.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's in highly technical
terms, and I'm not a scientist.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that was a fantastic
document that you shared with

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.250 align:middle line:90%
me earlier.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.930 align:middle line:84%
You want to read a part of
that document for the viewers?

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I think it is
pertinent to this, definitely.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:51.850 align:middle line:84%
We can maybe show it up on
the screen for everyone.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is called
"Examination of Eben Transport

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Craft."

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And the team that was assigned
to examine this craft from Los

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Alamos was called
the Alpha Team.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And the Alpha Team made a
report, and I have this report.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>> And I love it.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's very
highly technical,

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.280 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to read
one paragraph of it.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the viewers
can understand it.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:18.540 align:middle line:10%
Paragraph number one--

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:10%
"While electric charges
cannot be conducted from

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.900 align:middle line:10%
the charge-accumulating
fluid" and then parentheses,

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:30.600 align:middle line:10%
"Sims-Kyle," close parentheses,
"directly through the Toroid

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:35.430 align:middle line:10%
walls and edges, there will be
a capacitive effect that will

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.490 align:middle line:10%
accumulate charges of
an opposite polarity,

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.880 align:middle line:10%
on the outside surfaces which
will correspond to the inner

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.940 align:middle line:10%
ones intensity and location."

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:50.610 align:middle line:84%
That's that inner part
of the craft that moved.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.270 align:middle line:84%
"This 'diffused layer,' as it's
called by LANL Bravo Team,"

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:57.720 align:middle line:84%
which is a different team that
studied only the propulsion,

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:84%
"of electric charges occurs most
effectively when the liquid,"

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.369 align:middle line:84%
and in parentheses,
"e-plasma is moving,

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and the faster the
e-plasma moves,

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.020 align:middle line:84%
the more pronounced will be
the separation effects of its

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:84%
electric ions from the ions in
the differently moving diffuse

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle line:90%
layer outside."

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a very
technical term

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:26.220 align:middle line:84%
for how the electric charges
on the outside of that craft

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.190 align:middle line:90%
works when the craft is moving.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And now this also
goes in to explain

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.630 align:middle line:84%
that there's two
separate propulsion

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.520 align:middle line:90%
systems on this craft.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:40.140 align:middle line:84%
One propulsion system
is in our atmosphere,

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.330 align:middle line:90%
within our atmosphere.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:46.830 align:middle line:84%
It forms some kind of an
energy and the outside

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:49.830 align:middle line:84%
through polarity,
different polarities.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:58.210 align:middle line:84%
They also use a dipolar system
and e-plasma to open up space,

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:02.920 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, or create a
displacement of our atmosphere,

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:07.250 align:middle line:84%
so it can move quickly through
from one point to another.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.170 align:middle line:84%
They also found a
second propulsion system

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:11.040 align:middle line:90%
on this graph--

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.440 align:middle line:84%
and that's what the
Bravo Team did--

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:18.930 align:middle line:84%
which causes this craft to
fly faster than we could ever

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.050 align:middle line:84%
fly anything that we had because
it had a different propulsion

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.630 align:middle line:90%
system that worked in space.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And this different
propulsion system worked,

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.490 align:middle line:90%
we think, on zero-point energy.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, yeah.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And you probably understand
this a lot more than I do,

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Emery, but it works on some
form of zero-point energy,

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:47.670 align:middle line:84%
which allows high voltages
and high energy to be produced

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.580 align:middle line:84%
to move our space, so
to speak, as I was told.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.290 align:middle line:90%
And I'm using layman's terms.

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we're using this on
our subs right now to help go

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:84%
through the water and
separate the water.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And after reading the paper,
the significance I got out of it

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.710 align:middle line:84%
was the craft is creating
multiple toroidal fields

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.510 align:middle line:84%
wherever it wanted--
in front of the craft,

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.610 align:middle line:84%
behind the craft, which I
thought was pretty amazing.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And the actual plasma in
there is a type of capacitor.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.610 align:middle line:84%
So you have this
craft that actually

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.610 align:middle line:84%
is harvesting the
zero-point energy

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and keeping it in this
liquid state capacitor, which

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.640 align:middle line:90%
it can use whenever it wants.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, and the
energy never runs out.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.550 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
things that EBE told us

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:33.810 align:middle line:90%
before he passed away.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:38.790 align:middle line:84%
He was able to-- we asked
him, what do you use as fuel?

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.590 align:middle line:84%
He tried to explain
the fuel system,

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:43.080 align:middle line:84%
and we just couldn't
understand it.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.010 align:middle line:84%
But one of the questions
was, how do you refuel?

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.940 align:middle line:84%
He didn't understand
that because he

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.550 align:middle line:90%
didn't have to refuel.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:54.030 align:middle line:84%
It was there, and it
was constantly creating.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:20:00.185 align:middle line:84%
And it was constantly creating
by some unknown means.

00:20:00.185 --> 00:20:01.800 align:middle line:84%
In the end towards
this document,

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:84%
they're talking about
different frequencies,

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.420 align:middle line:84%
and some of our
scientists thought

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:84%
that these frequencies, these
high-gigahertz frequencies,

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:14.750 align:middle line:84%
were actually recharging
their system in some respect.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, absolutely.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.550 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating stuff.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Is this similar to
warp-drive technology

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.140 align:middle line:90%
or antigravitic technology?

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>> No, entirely different,
entirely different.

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:28.500 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing near there.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I think, our
scientists initially

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.473 align:middle line:84%
thought it had to
be antimatter pods

00:20:32.473 --> 00:20:33.640 align:middle line:90%
or something to that effect.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely, because
you're creating your own

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:39.210 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic field around
the craft, number one.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:43.980 align:middle line:84%
That's why you're not affected
by any 2,000-mile-an-hour

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:48.750 align:middle line:84%
right-hand turns, and you
are in your own space.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
affect anything

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.790 align:middle line:84%
where that craft goes because,
whether it's under the water

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.460 align:middle line:84%
or up in space, your
field around you

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.250 align:middle line:90%
is your own field of energy.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, and that's one
of the biggest questions

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.040 align:middle line:84%
the scientists
originally asked EBE.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.880 align:middle line:84%
How can you travel
this fast and make

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:13.080 align:middle line:84%
all these different maneuvers
without being harmed?

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And he couldn't understand
what the question was,

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't think, and he
couldn't explain it back.

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:21.690 align:middle line:84%
It was the environmental
system within that

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:23.970 align:middle line:84%
created their own little
atmosphere in there that

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:24.940 align:middle line:90%
protected them.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the big questions
our scientists wanted,

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.630 align:middle line:84%
because we could have
used it in the future, is,

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:31.540 align:middle line:90%
how does it work?

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.340 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.300 align:middle line:90%
We see it.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.150 align:middle line:90%
It's right here.

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:37.910 align:middle line:84%
This is your
environmental system.

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:38.827 align:middle line:90%
We don't how it works.

00:21:38.827 --> 00:21:41.035 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, back then, that
would have been a little bit

00:21:41.035 --> 00:21:41.990 align:middle line:90%
difficult, I guess.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the biggest
problems we have that

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:50.090 align:middle line:84%
scientists say about this is
that we, government scientists,

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Earth scientists, were
trying to adapt our physics

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:90%
to an extraterrestrial craft.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And that was their
biggest mistake,

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:01.970 align:middle line:84%
and that is one reason
why it was delayed

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:04.790 align:middle line:84%
for so long, because
our scientists,

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:08.210 align:middle line:84%
hard-nosed scientists
are saying,

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:11.990 align:middle line:84%
we have to figure this thing
out using our technology.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:13.220 align:middle line:90%
And that just didn't work.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Over the years,
they figured it out.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.610 align:middle line:90%
They figured, you know what?

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle line:90%
This is beyond our technology.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And some of these things that
are occurring on this craft,

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.350 align:middle line:84%
when they were testing
them in the '70s and '80s,

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.300 align:middle line:90%
defied our physics.

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
open-minded scientists

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:31.205 align:middle line:84%
figured it out that
what you know what?

00:22:31.205 --> 00:22:32.915 align:middle line:90%
We've got to go back to grade 1.

00:22:32.915 --> 00:22:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, all these
theories are gone now.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.280 align:middle line:84%
We've got to come up with
something new to explain this.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, and that's why
they created a different

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.250 align:middle line:84%
terminology--
"toroid" and "merdan"

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and some of these other
terms that are mentioned

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:50.360 align:middle line:84%
in the document and
to understand it.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And they even created a
different electrical system

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:58.130 align:middle line:84%
called Sims-Kyle, and they
had to go back to the lab

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and figure out, OK, if we
did this with the electrons,

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:06.110 align:middle line:84%
the Ohm's law and things like
that isn't going to work.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.330 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
modify our understanding

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:11.480 align:middle line:84%
of electricity to
understand his craft.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.320 align:middle line:90%
And they did that.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:16.970 align:middle line:84%
The scientists, very smart
scientists at Los Alamos,

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Sandia, and some other
laboratories figured it out.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:84%
They figured out how
to understand it,

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.930 align:middle line:84%
but still didn't
understand how it worked.

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And the strange thing about
the exterior of the craft--

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.750 align:middle line:90%
it's charged all the time.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:37.580 align:middle line:84%
You go up to it, and you
feel that static electricity.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Even when the power device
isn't on, you can just feel.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.510 align:middle line:84%
I think this is something that
Bob Lazar was talking about.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.340 align:middle line:90%
It's constantly charged.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.645 align:middle line:90%
It's still charged.

00:23:47.645 --> 00:23:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>> But how do you
get inside the craft?

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Is there a door?

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Does it just open up?

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And when you get inside,
what is the first thing

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:55.620 align:middle line:90%
that you actually see?

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>> The interior of the craft--

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:00.560 align:middle line:84%
there's a ramp that comes
down, a small opening.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.820 align:middle line:90%
These beings are small.

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.500 align:middle line:84%
They're 4-foot 5,
and these beings

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.260 align:middle line:84%
can get through smaller
space than we can,

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.690 align:middle line:90%
a normal-size human.

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:14.270 align:middle line:90%
And there's not steps.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:21.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a ramp, and it's this very
strange material on the ramp

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:23.080 align:middle line:84%
because when you put
your feet on the ramp,

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.300 align:middle line:90%
the ramp instantly moves.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.010 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to
climb up the ramp.

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:90%
It takes you up.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.310 align:middle line:90%
It transports you up there.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.170 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know that they--

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.900 align:middle line:84%
at least in 1987, they
couldn't understand

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.450 align:middle line:84%
exactly how that thing worked
because they couldn't take it

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:38.650 align:middle line:90%
apart.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.030 align:middle line:90%
They could not figure it out.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>> It was seamless.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>> It's seamless.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.450 align:middle line:84%
When you first walk
in up this ramp,

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:48.100 align:middle line:90%
you're in the control center.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:53.075 align:middle line:84%
Now, this craft is not that
big, 20 feet by something,

00:24:53.075 --> 00:24:55.390 align:middle line:84%
and I can't remember
exactly the dimensions.

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's positions, seating
positions for all the beings,

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.300 align:middle line:90%
the occupants.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have
a control panel.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:08.830 align:middle line:84%
They have places they place
their hands into, their digits.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's a screen, a smaller
screen for them to look at.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.970 align:middle line:90%
We didn't fly it at that point.

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we did fly
it, so we the screen

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.640 align:middle line:90%
lit up automatically.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.210 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't privy to
the flying of it.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:31.630 align:middle line:84%
But they had compartments,
resting compartments,

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:37.420 align:middle line:84%
small resting compartments where
the beings slept or rested.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.780 align:middle line:84%
One thing that EBE
told us was there

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:46.000 align:middle line:84%
always had to be one of them
in a seat with their hands

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.580 align:middle line:90%
in for the craft to fly.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:52.240 align:middle line:84%
There could be others
sleeping or resting.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.250 align:middle line:84%
EBE never referred to
anything as "sleeping."

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.440 align:middle line:84%
He didn't understand
what sleeping was,

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.630 align:middle line:84%
but he understood
what resting was,

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:02.170 align:middle line:84%
just resting, but not
sleeping, because maybe they

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.432 align:middle line:90%
didn't have that cycle.

00:26:04.432 --> 00:26:06.390 align:middle line:84%
They figured that out
because they watched him.

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:84%
They had videotapes on him
when he was in his little den,

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.440 align:middle line:90%
and he never slept.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.200 align:middle line:90%
He rested, but he didn't sleep.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, and then there
were other containers,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.360 align:middle line:84%
components inside there that
they couldn't understand what--

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.960 align:middle line:84%
the environmental system,
the propulsion system.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.370 align:middle line:84%
There was a compartment where
the food containers were.

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.980 align:middle line:90%
There was fluid.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:37.030 align:middle line:84%
It was a milky fluid, which
was something that they drank.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.120 align:middle line:84%
That was the extent of
the interior of the craft

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.710 align:middle line:90%
that I remember.

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you mentioned these
five seats in the craft.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Were they segmented out
in different rooms or just

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.450 align:middle line:90%
one big open space?

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>> One big open space for the
control panels and where they

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:58.230 align:middle line:84%
sat, and around the edges of the
craft was these resting places.

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.420 align:middle line:84%
The inside of the craft
was one large room.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:05.260 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't separate
rooms or separate cubicles.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:09.890 align:middle line:84%
It was just around the side of
the craft, the interior portion

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:10.690 align:middle line:90%
of the craft.

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:14.650 align:middle line:84%
There was these little
cubicles where they rested,

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:19.450 align:middle line:84%
but there wasn't any other rooms
except for under the craft.

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:22.840 align:middle line:84%
There was a small space under
the seating compartment.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.100 align:middle line:90%
There was a small--

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:28.420 align:middle line:84%
like a crawl space where
there were components welded

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:32.320 align:middle line:84%
or anchored to the floor,
some sort of propulsion

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.580 align:middle line:84%
or whatever they were using
it for or ran the craft,

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:40.610 align:middle line:84%
maybe some sort of a
weapons system, we thought.

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:42.380 align:middle line:90%
But we found out later--

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So it definitely
was not the restroom.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>> No, but they did have one.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.180 align:middle line:84%
But it was not
anything like ours.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.010 align:middle line:90%
They would sit.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:52.690 align:middle line:90%
They would bring it up to them.

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:57.130 align:middle line:84%
They would stand in
like a tube, and they

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:58.720 align:middle line:90%
would pull up this sheet.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And they would
relieve themselves,

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and then they
would go back down.

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.430 align:middle line:84%
It was recycled
somehow, the waste.

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that we--

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.330 align:middle line:84%
I was never privy
to how that was--

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:12.780 align:middle line:84%
there was one mention
in a document about it,

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:17.700 align:middle line:84%
but it was never explained
how the wastes were recycled

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.490 align:middle line:90%
or whatever they used it for.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And then there was also
one other compartment area

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:27.360 align:middle line:90%
that was a medical--

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.560 align:middle line:84%
like an infirmary,
small area where

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.970 align:middle line:84%
EBE said when they
were sick or hurt,

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:38.620 align:middle line:84%
they would go into
there to be treated.

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:39.420 align:middle line:90%
Again--

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Was it a bed or a different
type of lay-down area

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:43.867 align:middle line:90%
or a chair?

00:28:43.867 --> 00:28:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it was a bed.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:45.500 align:middle line:90%
It was a platform.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.435 align:middle line:90%


00:28:48.435 --> 00:28:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Another strange thing--
there was no bedding,

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.660 align:middle line:90%
no pillows, no cushions.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:29:01.500 align:middle line:84%
It was just like a metal place
to lay in like a metal bed.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's all it was there.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And in the medical area,
it was a little bit bigger,

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:11.340 align:middle line:84%
and it had other components that
probably treated them somehow,

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.030 align:middle line:84%
which I was never privy to how,
if they've ever figured that

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:14.830 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, tell us about
these screens that you saw.

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And also, you said they laid
their hands on something.

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:24.840 align:middle line:84%
How many digits do they
have on their palms?

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>> The control panel--

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.390 align:middle line:90%
they placed four.

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:29.260 align:middle line:90%
It was four-digit.

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And the screens, similar
to our television screens,

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:37.570 align:middle line:84%
were very, very, very
thin, and we couldn't

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:39.260 align:middle line:90%
understand how they worked.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is in the
'80s, so we didn't

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.540 align:middle line:90%
have plasma TV and things.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.490 align:middle line:84%
It was probably
figured out that it

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:49.330 align:middle line:84%
was something to do with
some advanced technology

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:50.830 align:middle line:84%
that we couldn't
understand that we

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.780 align:middle line:90%
might be understanding today.

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:57.490 align:middle line:84%
But I'm relating this
document in 1987,

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:00.130 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't understand
what they were.

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:01.060 align:middle line:90%
But they were screens.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.330 align:middle line:90%
There were three screens.

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:03.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.980 align:middle line:84%
There was one in the center,
and there was two in a side.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.830 align:middle line:84%
The two in a side were higher
than the center screen.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:14.860 align:middle line:84%
The center screen was probably
50 inches by 40 inches.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:18.610 align:middle line:84%
The ones in a side were
smaller, maybe 30 by 30.

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And I never saw the
screens on, so I

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.320 align:middle line:84%
don't know what the
view was, whether there

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:27.700 align:middle line:84%
was depth perception, it was
3D, or anything like that.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.710 align:middle line:84%
The picture I saw of the
interior of the craft

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:31.630 align:middle line:90%
just showed those screens.

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:34.870 align:middle line:84%
There were several pictures
that I saw in a document.

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:39.100 align:middle line:84%
This small videotape that I saw,
again, was the interior of it,

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.570 align:middle line:90%
but not with them on.

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:43.930 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know whether there
was any depth perception.

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:46.870 align:middle line:84%
They appeared to
be metal, almost.

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:48.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they appear
to be-- they're flat.

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Metallic?

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Metallic, yeah.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.920 align:middle line:90%
Metallic, exactly.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Metallic.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Were there any colors
or lights in the craft?

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.980 align:middle line:84%
How was it illuminated
so you guys could see?

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>> They had artificial lights.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.680 align:middle line:84%
The testing crew had brought
lighting system inside.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Everything was a dull gray.

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:07.810 align:middle line:84%
There was no colors
whatsoever inside this craft

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:08.920 align:middle line:90%
that I could see.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.230 align:middle line:84%
At least what I saw, there
was no colors whatsoever.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:15.130 align:middle line:84%
It was a dark,
metallic, gray color.

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:16.660 align:middle line:90%
Everything was.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Where were the craft in the
'80s after you had investigated

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:22.090 align:middle line:90%
this, and where are they today?

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1980, when I saw
them, they were at Area 51.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.360 align:middle line:84%
They were at a couple
of different locations.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.490 align:middle line:84%
They would move the
crafts around when

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:33.710 align:middle line:84%
they were doing different
experiments on both of them.

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:38.980 align:middle line:84%
So in Papoose, or S-2, as
Bob Lazar would call it--

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.300 align:middle line:90%
it's actually S-4.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.480 align:middle line:90%
S-4 is the lower level--

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and also on the base, the
regular Groom Lake Base

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.480 align:middle line:84%
where they were trying to
get it to fly and so forth.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.500 align:middle line:84%
So at least in the '80s,
that's the last place

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:57.040 align:middle line:84%
I knew they were, and I'm
sure they are still there now.

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you guys able to
analyze any of the materials

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:03.070 align:middle line:84%
on the outside or inside of
the craft to find out what they

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:04.510 align:middle line:90%
were made out of?

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the material's
unknown to us.

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:09.310 align:middle line:84%
The molecules--
they did scrapings.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:11.920 align:middle line:84%
They did all sorts of
analysis of the exterior

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.410 align:middle line:84%
and interior of the crafts,
all the different types

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:16.220 align:middle line:84%
of materials that
they could locate

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.050 align:middle line:90%
in and outside the craft.

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:19.510 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't understand it.

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:24.000 align:middle line:84%
They think there was
something similar to zinc

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.430 align:middle line:84%
and some other elements from
the periodic table in there,

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:32.850 align:middle line:84%
but they had
characteristics different

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:35.970 align:middle line:84%
than our periodic
table, the elements

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:37.530 align:middle line:90%
within our periodic table.

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And that really confused
the scientists, especially

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.770 align:middle line:84%
the hard-nosed
scientists, saying,

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:45.150 align:middle line:84%
well, this material had
to come from the universe,

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and we know everything
in the universe.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So it had to be within
the periodic table.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And the other more
open-minded scientists

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.340 align:middle line:90%
say, well, you know what?

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.630 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how
they made this.

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:01.920 align:middle line:84%
They come from a planet that
had some other material that we

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.600 align:middle line:90%
don't have here on this Earth.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:11.010 align:middle line:84%
So at that point in 1987, they
didn't understand the material,

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:13.020 align:middle line:84%
couldn't figure out
what the material was.

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:16.860 align:middle line:84%
But they did think there
was some zinc in it.

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>> You said we were
able to fly these craft.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:23.580 align:middle line:84%
How long did that take, and
where do they test this at?

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>> They tested these
crafts in Area 51.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, the craft
that crashed in Horse Mesa

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:34.170 align:middle line:84%
was the one that
actually flew in 1985.

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:35.655 align:middle line:90%
They got it to fly.

00:33:35.655 --> 00:33:39.810 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't flown very long,
but they did get it to fly.

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:41.790 align:middle line:90%
They had a pilot in it.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:44.190 align:middle line:84%
He was able to take
it off and land it.

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's all I know
about the actual flight.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.230 align:middle line:84%
As I understand,
later, they flew it,

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and they've probably
flown it since.

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:55.440 align:middle line:84%
But I was only privy to that
one flight that took place

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.600 align:middle line:90%
at Groom Lake, not at Papoose.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Through my experience,
a lot of those craft have

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.450 align:middle line:84%
consciousness-assisted
technology where it bonds with

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:04.470 align:middle line:90%
the pilot.

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:09.780 align:middle line:84%
How are these human pilots
able to navigate and fly

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:10.860 align:middle line:90%
these craft?

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.639 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can't
answer that question.

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:16.110 align:middle line:84%
But I can answer melding
your thought waves

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:17.100 align:middle line:90%
with the instruments.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.050 align:middle line:90%
I know that has occurred.

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:21.449 align:middle line:84%
I know there's crafts
out there that have.

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:25.350 align:middle line:84%
I was told years later, just
not four or five years ago,

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:28.050 align:middle line:84%
that that's what we
got from the EBE craft.

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:32.820 align:middle line:84%
We got that technology
from the EBE-1 or 2 craft.

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.670 align:middle line:84%
But going back to
your question, how

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:37.830 align:middle line:84%
did they actually fly
it, with their hands--

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that.

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Where are the Ebens now?

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.989 align:middle line:90%
>> Where are the Ebens now?

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:46.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, EBE-1 died in 1952.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.350 align:middle line:90%
EBE-2 was a female.

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:53.650 align:middle line:84%
She came here on an exchange
program from the planet Serpo,

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:57.880 align:middle line:84%
where EBE-1 came from, the
Zeta Reticuli star system.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.780 align:middle line:84%
So she was also
code-named J-Rod.

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Why she was code-named
J-Rod, I don't have any idea,

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:09.820 align:middle line:84%
but there are scientists that
have worked on the program

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:12.790 align:middle line:90%
that even today calls her J-Rod.

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:16.190 align:middle line:84%
To the best of my knowledge,
she's still alive.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.700 align:middle line:84%
She's still assisting us
with reverse engineering

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:24.570 align:middle line:84%
of Eben crafts at Area
51 or at Papoose Lake.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And what are we doing
with these reverse-engineered

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.170 align:middle line:90%
crafts?

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>> We're advancing our
aeronautical technology

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:33.870 align:middle line:90%
and other technologies.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:36.420 align:middle line:10%
Phil Corso wrote
a book about it.

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.980 align:middle line:10%
I think that book
was highly accurate.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:41.610 align:middle line:10%
He had some, I
think, mistakes in it

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:43.290 align:middle line:10%
that he relied on
other people to write

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:47.130 align:middle line:10%
for him that stated that the
bodies were taken to Fort Riley

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.410 align:middle line:10%
where, and they were
never taken to Fort Riley.

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.680 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, that
book was very highly accurate.

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
people that stand by it.

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:58.215 align:middle line:84%
Corporation executives
who were around back then

00:35:58.215 --> 00:36:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and are still
alive said, yes, we

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:02.490 align:middle line:84%
did get these things
from the government.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Government came in one day and
planted these blueprints down

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, try to
create one of these things.

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And the first question was,
where did it come from?

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.510 align:middle line:90%
Don't ask those questions.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:13.380 align:middle line:90%
Just make it.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.550 align:middle line:90%
Just try to make it.

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a lot
of reverse engineering

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:19.845 align:middle line:84%
that occurred from the day
that that craft crashed

00:36:19.845 --> 00:36:22.660 align:middle line:90%
in 1947 to present day.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you believe we have
these craft already available,

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:31.740 align:middle line:84%
being used by the secret space
program that can actually go

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:35.610 align:middle line:84%
into space, possibly even
into the solar system?

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:38.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I know that for a fact.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.640 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to an Air Force
general, and he was the one

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.410 align:middle line:90%
who spoke at a UFO convention.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:47.040 align:middle line:84%
He spoke to us privately
afterwards and said,

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.760 align:middle line:84%
we were successfully
able to fly the EBE-2

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:55.610 align:middle line:84%
craft with the
EBE-2's assistance,

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:58.460 align:middle line:90%
the craft crashed in Horse Mesa.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:02.170 align:middle line:84%
We were able to fly that
out of our atmosphere

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:05.540 align:middle line:84%
and into our solar
system and back.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And then we were able to
reverse engineer crafts

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:13.190 align:middle line:84%
with that same technology
or similar technology.

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:18.590 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't reverse everything
that was on those Eben crafts,

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:21.620 align:middle line:84%
but we got enough
to be able to have

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:25.610 align:middle line:84%
highly classified crafts
that were able to fly

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:26.990 align:middle line:90%
into the solar system.

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:30.830 align:middle line:84%
He didn't specifically say,
we had a secret space program,

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:34.700 align:middle line:84%
but he said, we had crafts,
some reverse engineers, and then

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:39.530 align:middle line:84%
the one craft from
Horse Mesa that we

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:41.630 align:middle line:90%
were able to repair and fly.

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So you can put that
two and two together

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:47.210 align:middle line:84%
get that we have a
secret space program.

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>> And who owns that?

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Is that government
owned, military owned,

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.310 align:middle line:90%
corporation owned?

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>> To the best of my knowledge,
it's military owned, I believe,

00:37:57.350 --> 00:37:58.730 align:middle line:84%
although I don't
know for a fact.

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:02.670 align:middle line:84%
But I think that the
military would control it.

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one
of the reasons they

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.200 align:middle line:90%
created a space for us.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.600 align:middle line:84%
We have a separate
military branch now

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.730 align:middle line:84%
called the Space
Force, and I honestly

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:13.970 align:middle line:84%
think that they're
flying these crafts.

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic intel, Rick.

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:17.510 align:middle line:84%
