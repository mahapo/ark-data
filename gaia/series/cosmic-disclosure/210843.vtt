00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.540 align:middle line:10%
>> TIM: Today on
"Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.930 align:middle line:10%
we are with Richard Doty, a
retired counterintelligence

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.540 align:middle line:10%
agent who served in the
Air Force Office of Special

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.920 align:middle line:10%
Investigations.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.720 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Richard.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.053 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD DOTY: Thank you, Tim.

00:00:32.053 --> 00:00:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Rick, if I talk to 100
people about military bases

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.360 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, one would
certainly mention Area 51

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.730 align:middle line:90%
and you served on the space.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Rick, there's a lot
of rumors about it.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Is the United States government
in possession of an alien being

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.230 align:middle line:90%
from an outside planet?

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: First of all, let
me explain what Area 51 is.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Area 51 is a base located within
the Nellis Test and Training

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.990 align:middle line:90%
Range.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.790 align:middle line:84%
The official name of Area
51 is Groom Lake Complex,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.440 align:middle line:84%
which houses the Air
Force's test and evaluation

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.610 align:middle line:84%
detachment three, which tests
research and development

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.970 align:middle line:84%
aircrafts in that
area around that base.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Your question, was there a
extraterrestrial housed there?

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.350 align:middle line:90%
The answer is yes.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.900 align:middle line:84%
There was a special
location Northwest

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.800 align:middle line:84%
of Papoose Lake called
the S2 complex which

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.960 align:middle line:90%
housed extraterrestrial--

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.310 align:middle line:90%
I'll call them visitors.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Are these remains of
the infamous Roswell crash

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.950 align:middle line:90%
in the year 1947?

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I was stationed
there between 1982 and 1985

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.470 align:middle line:90%
at various times.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.840 align:middle line:84%
During that time
period, the only thing

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.080 align:middle line:84%
we had there were live ETs that
we either found in a crash site

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.080 align:middle line:84%
or came to us in
some other manner.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And they were being
detained in there.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
they're being detained

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.520 align:middle line:84%
there is some of the ETs have
unique biological structures

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.450 align:middle line:84%
which required a different
atmosphere for them to breathe

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and a different
environment for them.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And we built these containment
centers, we call them,

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.930 align:middle line:84%
in order for them to
maintain life on this planet.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Now none of them there-- we
didn't have any bodies there.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.880 align:middle line:84%
We had all live
ETs, live beings.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.900 align:middle line:84%
The crash site at Roswell, or
actually, Corona in New Mexico

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.990 align:middle line:90%
contained five dead ETs.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Those bodies were transported
to a special laboratory,

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.550 align:middle line:84%
a cryogenic laboratory,
to maintain their being

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.850 align:middle line:84%
or their structure
while we study them.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
one live alien that we

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.660 align:middle line:84%
found at the scene EBE
1, but he died in 1952

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.450 align:middle line:90%
before Area 51 was ever created.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Wow.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.430 align:middle line:84%
You just confirmed
that live alien beings

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.100 align:middle line:90%
are housed at Area 51.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And do the people working
there, the soldiers,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.900 align:middle line:90%
do they know about it?

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, everything's
compartmented in a special

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.030 align:middle line:90%
access program.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And just the knowledge,
the mere fact

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.360 align:middle line:84%
that we had extraterrestrials
in our possession,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.820 align:middle line:90%
was highly classified.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.130 align:middle line:84%
We call it a Special
Access Program

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:90%
or compartmentalization.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So not everyone on
the base knew it.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Only the people that worked
there within the complex,

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.011 align:middle line:84%
within the S2 annex, or
people that had a need to know

00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:90%
had access to that information.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.950 align:middle line:84%
So not everybody
on the base had it.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.890 align:middle line:84%
The base was just like
any other communities

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.990 align:middle line:90%
because rumors got out.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:01.070 align:middle line:84%
So there was always a rumor
about what was at S2 complex.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was our job as
counterintelligence officers

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:90%
to quell those rumors.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So if we heard something being
spoken about on the base,

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:15.230 align:middle line:84%
we quickly jumped on it and
managed to quell or stop

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.795 align:middle line:90%
the spread of rumors.

00:04:16.795 --> 00:04:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: You said the only
people who had the need--

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.580 align:middle line:84%
who have a need to know have
knowledge about these beings

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.390 align:middle line:90%
and the existence of them.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a need to know?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I did in a couple
of different occasions.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.780 align:middle line:84%
One being-- one situation
where one escaped

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.190 align:middle line:84%
and it escaped
from that facility.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.970 align:middle line:84%
So we assisted in search
and capture of that ET

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and the investigation
of what that ET

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.460 align:middle line:90%
did while it had escaped.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.560 align:middle line:84%
So I had a need to
know that information.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.530 align:middle line:84%
So I was briefed into
that particular species

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.420 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrials.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, it was a very
narrow need to know for me.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.730 align:middle line:84%
I knew the complex
existed, but I

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.500 align:middle line:84%
didn't know anything about what
was there until one escaped.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Then I was given access in
order to try to catch the ET

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.380 align:middle line:84%
and then cover up the
fact that it had escaped.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.360 align:middle line:84%
If it had been in contact with
anyone that wasn't authorized

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.160 align:middle line:84%
or anyone outside the base, the
local community outside Nellis

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Test and Training Range, it
would be our responsibility

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.510 align:middle line:84%
as OSI agents to go out
and disinform the people.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.030 align:middle line:84%
So I had to have knowledge of
that particular species that

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.830 align:middle line:90%
escaped.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Have you actually
seen these beings?

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, the one that
escaped and the species of that

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.210 align:middle line:84%
particular ET was
called a quantaloid.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.250 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know who named it.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.610 align:middle line:84%
I think someone within a
Defense Intelligence Agency.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.390 align:middle line:84%
It was a insect-like
similar to a praying mantis,

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.350 align:middle line:90%
although 6 foot tall, large.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.730 align:middle line:90%
I saw it.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:20.190 align:middle line:84%
I saw it after it had been
neutralized by military police

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.090 align:middle line:90%
personnel.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.550 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't see it before that.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.930 align:middle line:84%
But after that and
after it had escaped,

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.930 align:middle line:84%
then I was given
access because we

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.690 align:middle line:90%
had another one in captivity.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I read about
that particular species.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And during that time
period that I had access

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.240 align:middle line:84%
to that particular
type of species,

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.120 align:middle line:84%
because we were concerned
that if one escaped,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:90%
maybe the other one would.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And we had to figure
out how it escaped.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And initially that
investigative power

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.560 align:middle line:84%
was given to the military police
that was guarding the facility.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.670 align:middle line:84%
But then, there was a lot of
questions about whether they

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.150 align:middle line:90%
had the expertise.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So we came in and we brought
in some other people, experts

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.960 align:middle line:84%
in metallurgy and
other areas of science,

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:19.440 align:middle line:84%
to try to determine how this
particular creature got out

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:84%
of the facility because it was
a very, very secure facility

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:29.040 align:middle line:84%
with three different perimeters
and a locking structure

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.640 align:middle line:84%
that was not supposed to
be defeated by anyone.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.500 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, that particular
species, the quantaloid,

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.460 align:middle line:90%
got out.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.380 align:middle line:90%
So we did go in there.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Now during my time that I
was there investigating--

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and we were allowed
into the area--

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.370 align:middle line:90%
I saw some other ETs.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And I saw one that
I would call a grey,

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.670 align:middle line:84%
a small grey-looking
with large eyes.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Similar to a picture
I saw of EBE 1

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.700 align:middle line:84%
who was with us between 1947
and 1952, well before my time.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:09.690 align:middle line:84%
But there were pictures of
him in classified documents.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And I saw-- so I saw
a picture of EBE 1.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And that particular one that
I saw at that containment

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:22.440 align:middle line:84%
facility was I would compare
it to EBE 1 or EBE, the EBENs.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.990 align:middle line:84%
The same ones that
crashed in and around

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:26.790 align:middle line:84%
near Roswell or
Corona, New Mexico.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.500 align:middle line:90%
Now that's the only one I saw.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.159 align:middle line:84%
But I did have access
at some other point,

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and not during that time
period, but some other

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:39.030 align:middle line:84%
to five different
species that we'd had,

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:44.700 align:middle line:84%
we either had or had in
the past there at Area 51.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:84%
But there was just
limited information

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.420 align:middle line:84%
on those particular five
species that I had access to.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Fascinating.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:03.680 align:middle line:84%
A live escaping ET being,
escaping from a military base

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.810 align:middle line:90%
must be a very sensitive moment.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:10.610 align:middle line:84%
How can I imagine the emotions
going on when that happened?

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, I
was at my office,

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.860 align:middle line:84%
at the Cutoman area of Area
51 at Groom Lake complex.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.830 align:middle line:84%
OSI, our building
number was 435.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.720 align:middle line:90%
And we were in that.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.170 align:middle line:84%
There was four OSI agents
assigned to Area 51

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:26.490 align:middle line:90%
during that time period.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:30.160 align:middle line:84%
When that particular
species of ET escaped,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.820 align:middle line:84%
we were immediately
notified by the base police.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:39.800 align:middle line:84%
My boss, the commander
of the office,

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.150 align:middle line:90%
got the first phone call.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.820 align:middle line:84%
He immediately told
one of the agents

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.100 align:middle line:84%
who had access to
that information

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.820 align:middle line:90%
about what had happened.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.737 align:middle line:84%
He immediately
needed assistance.

00:09:49.737 --> 00:09:51.320 align:middle line:84%
There's only four
of us in the office.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.820 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't go out
there by himself.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.910 align:middle line:84%
So he then briefed me,
quickly briefed me.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Then we had to go
to another office

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:01.340 align:middle line:84%
next to our building, the
Intelligence Operations

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Center where I was
given more of a briefing

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and shown a picture of what this
particular entity looked like.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a chance then
to really read into it.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.000 align:middle line:90%
I thought, you know what--

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.450 align:middle line:84%
my first question was,
what's its capability?

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Did it have some sort
of a advanced ability

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:25.640 align:middle line:90%
to defend itself?

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Did it have a weapon
system within its body?

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:90%
The strength of it?

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.843 align:middle line:84%
All these things
were going in my head

00:10:31.843 --> 00:10:38.090 align:middle line:84%
because I had no idea that
we had these type of species

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:39.090 align:middle line:90%
of ETs there.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Right.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.010 align:middle line:90%
Did it?

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: It did.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.850 align:middle line:84%
It did have some
unique abilities

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.560 align:middle line:90%
that I found out later.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the problems
for it, the quantaloid,

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.930 align:middle line:90%
was that it had to--

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:57.560 align:middle line:84%
there was too much oxygen in our
atmosphere for it to breathe.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So it was inside a
containment area or cell

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:08.600 align:middle line:84%
that had less oxygen than a
21% or 22% we would breathe.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.990 align:middle line:84%
It required something to the
neighborhood of 15% to 18%

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.370 align:middle line:90%
in order for it to survive.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:19.770 align:middle line:84%
So if it got outside,
it would have to have--

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.350 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
exactly how this worked,

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.660 align:middle line:90%
but an oxygen depressor.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Something that it would have to
put on its beak, so to speak,

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:31.050 align:middle line:84%
because it was a praying
mantis, so to speak.

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So someone, I guess, we must
have manufactured something,

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.850 align:middle line:90%
or maybe, it had its own.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.570 align:middle line:84%
It had to have one of
those when it escaped.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's smart
enough to realize it--

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.510 align:middle line:90%
it took it with them.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So now it was able to function
in our atmosphere, which

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:49.750 align:middle line:90%
is somewhat scary.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.620 align:middle line:84%
So we only had probably 15
to 20 minutes to be briefed.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Right.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: And then we went out.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Now we weren't
there to catch him

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.770 align:middle line:84%
because they had detainment
teams of people that

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:05.760 align:middle line:84%
had been trained, some military
police, some scientists,

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.350 align:middle line:84%
some that have worked
inside that facility.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So they're the ones
that actually went out

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.220 align:middle line:90%
to capture it.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.590 align:middle line:90%
We went out there to protect.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:14.520 align:middle line:90%
Now we were armed.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.000 align:middle line:90%
We had weapons.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Then another question I had
was, is the .45 caliber weapon

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.290 align:middle line:84%
that I'm carrying, that bullet,
is that capable of killing it

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:28.830 align:middle line:90%
or will harm it in any way?

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the scientists told us,
not there in the Intelligence

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Operations Center but out in the
field while we were driving out

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:84%
to where we think it was
going, yes, but you'd

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.100 align:middle line:90%
have to shoot it in its head.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.190 align:middle line:84%
The body might just absorb
it because there was never

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.570 align:middle line:90%
any tests done.

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.400 align:middle line:84%
They've never went
out and shot one.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:53.160 align:middle line:84%
But he thinks the brain
functioning of the entity,

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.880 align:middle line:84%
if it was disabled,
it would kill it

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.370 align:middle line:84%
or it would disable
it to a point

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.660 align:middle line:90%
where they could capture it.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.350 align:middle line:84%
We certainly weren't out
there to capture it, myself

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.720 align:middle line:90%
and my partner, OSI agents.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.140 align:middle line:84%
We were just out there
to cover the tracks

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.350 align:middle line:84%
if it got outside of
the base perimeter.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
it got outside.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Another thing about
this quantaloid, it

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.860 align:middle line:90%
was able to run extremely fast.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean we're talking 20
to 30 miles per hour.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.940 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very, very fast.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And so the containment
location was

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.810 align:middle line:84%
north of Papoose Lake
which is probably

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:90%
in the center of Area 51.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And in the center, probably of
Nellis Test and Training Range,

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.370 align:middle line:84%
which is about
1,200 square miles.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.550 align:middle line:84%
So it got to the
northern perimeter.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.480 align:middle line:90%
It was going north.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:90%
We could see by its footprints.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Its tracks, it was going north.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So the teams had to drive
quickly to get there, to it.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And they were certainly
far ahead of us.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.870 align:middle line:84%
They also launched helicopters
and even some planes

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.860 align:middle line:90%
to try to follow it.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: So it was probably--

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:17.700 align:middle line:90%
was it night or was it daytime?

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: No, it was daytime.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.600 align:middle line:90%
It was approximately 1100 hour--

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.970 align:middle line:84%
11 o'clock AM in the
morning, approximately.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: OK.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So it was daytime,
you and another team

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:33.690 align:middle line:84%
were chasing and hunting
a life alien being,

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:34.650 align:middle line:90%
what happened then?

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.170 align:middle line:90%
How did the story resolve?

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: The helicopters
certainly were able to fly

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.280 align:middle line:90%
faster.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.080 align:middle line:84%
There's two helicopters launch
one from Tonopah Air Force

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Base, which is 80 miles
Northwest of Groom Lake, still

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.110 align:middle line:84%
within the Nellis Test
and Training Range.

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And then one was
launched from Groom Lake.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.130 align:middle line:90%
So they got there first.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And they were patrolling
the base perimeter

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:59.190 align:middle line:84%
of the northern perimeter near
a place called Silver Bow.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So they were protecting
or they were expecting

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.210 align:middle line:84%
the entity, the
quantaloid, to head

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:09.850 align:middle line:84%
that way because the tracks
were heading that way.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.590 align:middle line:84%
But from where it escaped
to the northern perimeter,

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:18.090 align:middle line:84%
it was about 50 miles,
approximately 50 miles.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So some of the scientists
that had studied

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
this particular entity
knew how fast it could run,

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.160 align:middle line:90%
as estimated.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And so they gauged
the time periods

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:33.660 align:middle line:84%
that it probably could have
gotten to the perimeter.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.310 align:middle line:84%
It would have gotten
there before we

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:90%
could have driven there.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Another problem we
had was we didn't

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:44.280 align:middle line:84%
know exactly what time it
escaped or when it escaped.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:49.290 align:middle line:84%
The guards around the
facility had 30-minute checks.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:53.530 align:middle line:84%
They had to check the
containment cells every 30

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:84%
minutes and made sure
they had visual contacts

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.530 align:middle line:90%
with the entities inside.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.050 align:middle line:84%
When they got there
and they found

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.990 align:middle line:84%
that this particular
entity was gone,

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:84%
we don't know where
the time period.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.380 align:middle line:84%
It was at least 30
minutes, probably.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.120 align:middle line:84%
So it had a
30-minute head start.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:84%
The tracks, the footprints,
of the quantaloid left

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:22.630 align:middle line:84%
somewhat of a web, webbing
mark, like a huge bird.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not
familiar with tracks,

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:28.620 align:middle line:84%
but it was a 3-point
long track as

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.650 align:middle line:84%
if it was something
similar to three fingers,

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:35.070 align:middle line:84%
but very, very big because
it had big, big feet.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And then the back of the
foot had a little stump.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And that was a distinctive
marking of this quantaloid.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the people
that we're tracking

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.310 align:middle line:84%
knew what the
footprints looked like.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.430 align:middle line:84%
We obviously never
seen them before.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.310 align:middle line:84%
It was obvious that it wasn't
any animal that I'd ever seen

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.590 align:middle line:84%
or any tracks of an
animal I've seen.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:03.900 align:middle line:84%
There was a
abandoned silver mine

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.319 align:middle line:84%
in Silver Bow, which was just
outside the base perimeter

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:11.280 align:middle line:84%
in a Northeast area of Nellis
Test and Training Range.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's used as a campgrounds,
a campsite for a lot of people.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
family camping there.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And the husband and
father saw something,

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.369 align:middle line:84%
got out of his vehicle,
and approached something.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And he was approached,
this quantaloid.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And exactly what happened and
how this American was killed,

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.770 align:middle line:84%
it would take a lot of
real-- a lot of time

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:43.980 align:middle line:90%
for me to explain it.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.600 align:middle line:90%
But it was-- he was killed.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.610 align:middle line:90%
The mother saw this happen.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.490 align:middle line:84%
She immediately switched
from the passenger seat

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.850 align:middle line:84%
to the driver's seat because
she had two kids in the backseat

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.650 align:middle line:90%
and she drove out of there.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.450 align:middle line:90%
She drove very fast.

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Now this quantaloid tried to
follow that vehicle, but only

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.640 align:middle line:84%
for a short period
of time, according

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.850 align:middle line:84%
to the woman who we obviously
interviewed at great lengths

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.450 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.210 align:middle line:90%
She didn't know what it was.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, if you put
yourself in her position,

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.200 align:middle line:90%
her concern was her children.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So she was driving on
the road east to go--

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.090 align:middle line:90%
just get away from there.

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Then for some reason,
because we can't

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.370 align:middle line:84%
get into the mind
of this quantaloid,

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:33.850 align:middle line:90%
it returned back into the base.

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's when it encountered
the military police.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.200 align:middle line:84%
The military police were
close enough to the base,

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:46.360 align:middle line:84%
to the perimeter, to see
what had happened or noticed

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.740 align:middle line:84%
that there was a human
there in a vehicle.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:53.305 align:middle line:84%
And so they then use
deadly force against the--

00:18:53.305 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and their bullets neutralized
or killed the entity.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there was a lot
of follow-up investigations

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.050 align:middle line:84%
later interviewing her and
the children and so forth.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So without going
into too much details,

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:15.740 align:middle line:84%
this being approaching the
human, the husband actually,

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.440 align:middle line:90%
was it an act of self-defense?

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.820 align:middle line:90%
Was it hostile?

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.360 align:middle line:90%
Could you explain that?

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, first of all,
I had to put yourself in that

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.350 align:middle line:90%
quantaloid's place.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:31.400 align:middle line:84%
It probably never encountered
a vehicle or any other humans

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.130 align:middle line:84%
other than the humans that were
at the containment facility.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.070 align:middle line:90%
So it was trying to escape.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And so the consensus
of the team,

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.000 align:middle line:84%
the investigative team, which
includes a lot of people.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was
probably 50 people

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.000 align:middle line:84%
involved in the
investigations of this.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.930 align:middle line:84%
It was a consensus of
them, and even myself

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:84%
that it was a self-defense
act by the quantaloid.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Now the only person
that actually

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.400 align:middle line:84%
saw this was a
military policeman who

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.880 align:middle line:84%
was in a civilian type
of jeep, a CJ7 Jeep.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And he was the closest
to the perimeter.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.100 align:middle line:90%
He saw what had happened.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.430 align:middle line:84%
He's actually the one
that shot the quantaloid.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said that the human
ran towards the quantaloid.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:90%
And the quantaloid was still.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the act
of the arm swing--

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:37.470 align:middle line:84%
the quantaloid's arm
swinging motion at the human

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.870 align:middle line:84%
and striking the
human with great

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:45.940 align:middle line:84%
force that the human
died instantly.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And then when it
then came towards,

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:52.590 align:middle line:84%
back towards inside
the base perimeter,

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that's when the military
policeman fired his weapon

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.320 align:middle line:90%
and killed the quantaloid.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: We have a live ET
being on the run that you have

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.170 align:middle line:90%
personally seen.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:07.710 align:middle line:84%
We have a dead
husband, and we have

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:11.940 align:middle line:84%
a wife with two children
trying to escape,

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and it was your job to
deal with this situation.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.180 align:middle line:90%
How did that go on?

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.840 align:middle line:90%
What did you do with the family?

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.133 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, first of
all, the woman drove--

00:21:23.133 --> 00:21:24.300 align:middle line:90%
she didn't know where to go.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.000 align:middle line:90%
She hadn't driven there.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.080 align:middle line:90%
The husband had.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.210 align:middle line:84%
So she wasn't familiar
with the place.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:32.850 align:middle line:84%
These people weren't
from that area.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:36.300 align:middle line:84%
They were from some
other town farther away.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And well, actually,
North of Las Vegas.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So she didn't really
know what to do.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.710 align:middle line:90%
She drove out to a dirt road.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.420 align:middle line:90%
And now, this is a remote area.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.230 align:middle line:84%
It took her about an
hour to get to a road

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:53.670 align:middle line:84%
where she went to a
facility, a bar and grill

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:57.090 align:middle line:84%
in Warm Springs, a Warm
Springs bar and grill, which

00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:00.990 align:middle line:84%
was about 60 miles away and
yelled and screamed for help.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, the patrons
tried to help her.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:08.130 align:middle line:84%
They called the local
Sheriff's department.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:09.870 align:middle line:84%
The Sheriff's
Department responded.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:84%
She tells the story to
the Sheriff's Department.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Now you can imagine a deputy
sheriff or a police officer

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:21.850 align:middle line:84%
listening to her try to explain
what happened to her husband

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.340 align:middle line:90%
that some kind of monster--

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and she was calling it monster
when I interviewed her.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:30.920 align:middle line:84%
That's what killed her
husband at Silver Bow.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, two Nye County
Sheriff's Deputies

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:36.260 align:middle line:90%
responded and spoke to her.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And they were very, very
sympathetic towards her,

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.180 align:middle line:84%
but they thought that
it was some animal.

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.790 align:middle line:84%
It was a mountain lion or
something to that effect.

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And of course, these
sheriff's deputies

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.880 align:middle line:84%
have no idea what's
inside Area 51.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So we get the call almost four
hours later from Tonopah Base

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Police that there's
a lady claiming

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:06.290 align:middle line:84%
that some monster killed
her husband near Silver

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Bow and the monster
ran into the base.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, we knew then what it was.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.790 align:middle line:84%
We knew because we were
trying to find this lady.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.040 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know where she went.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.210 align:middle line:84%
We knew-- well, we knew
there was a vehicle.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.710 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know there was a lady
and children in the vehicle.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.600 align:middle line:84%
The military police
saw the vehicle leave.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.910 align:middle line:84%
So we, by the time
we got to her,

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.240 align:middle line:84%
she was at Tonopah,
the town of Tonopah,

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.890 align:middle line:90%
at the Sheriff's Department.

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Myself and another
agent out of Tonopah--

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:38.800 align:middle line:84%
OSHA Tonopah-- went
out there to visit her.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.420 align:middle line:90%
And she was hysterical.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:47.650 align:middle line:84%
We had to eventually take her
to a hospital there in Tonopah.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:53.680 align:middle line:84%
The children were of age where
they knew something happened,

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.810 align:middle line:84%
but they were as confused
as you could get.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't want to interview
the children before we

00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.248 align:middle line:90%
interviewed the mother.

00:23:59.248 --> 00:24:00.790 align:middle line:84%
We eventually
interviewed the mother.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:02.440 align:middle line:90%
We got the story.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.620 align:middle line:90%
We've interviewed the children.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.820 align:middle line:90%
What do you tell?

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:13.560 align:middle line:84%
We, I think, convinced her
that it was not a monster.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.850 align:middle line:90%
It was a mutated animal.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:19.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we used.

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:22.980 align:middle line:84%
A mutated animal
that had done it.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.360 align:middle line:90%
And she saw it.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.240 align:middle line:90%
She saw this entity.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.917 align:middle line:84%
And it was very difficult.
I mean, for me, for us,

00:24:29.917 --> 00:24:32.250 align:middle line:84%
to sit there with all the
people involved in this trying

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.260 align:middle line:84%
to explain to her that
your husband was killed

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.260 align:middle line:84%
by a mutated animal
at Silver Bow

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.360 align:middle line:90%
and it ran back into the base.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And we went eventually to
her home in North Las Vegas

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and sat down with her
and talked to her.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:49.650 align:middle line:84%
We didn't want to tell
her the truth, number one.

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:53.280 align:middle line:84%
But one of her questions,
which she was very smart lady

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.910 align:middle line:84%
is, why is the government
investigating something

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.640 align:middle line:84%
that the state of Nevada
should be investigating,

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.210 align:middle line:90%
which would make sense to me.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:03.160 align:middle line:90%
If it was an animal--

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Right.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Why wouldn't
the sheriff's department

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:11.130 align:middle line:84%
or the Nevada game and fish
people responsible for animals

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.030 align:middle line:90%
be investigating this?

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:15.788 align:middle line:84%
Which is a tough question
for me to answer to her.

00:25:15.788 --> 00:25:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: What did you say?

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, eventually, I was
allowed to tell her the truth.

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And she signed a number of
documents and the Air Force

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.330 align:middle line:90%
settled with her, a claim.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:34.020 align:middle line:84%
She made a claim through
Nellis Air Force Base

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.530 align:middle line:84%
which was a controlling base
that's North of Las Vegas,

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:39.690 align:middle line:84%
of Nevada Test and
Training Range.

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:40.950 align:middle line:90%
So it was all settled.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:44.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she was given
money and so forth.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not here to
discuss any of that.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, her son,
oldest son, years later

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.600 align:middle line:90%
joined the Air Force.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- and this is
a very interesting story

00:25:56.570 --> 00:26:02.830 align:middle line:84%
because he became a Air Force
military policeman assigned

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:04.330 align:middle line:90%
to Groom Lake.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Interesting.

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And one of the
sergeants that was on that

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:17.120 align:middle line:84%
detail chasing the quantaloid
was his senior sergeant.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Unbeknownst to him,
the senior sergeant,

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:25.100 align:middle line:84%
that this guy's
father had died there,

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.590 align:middle line:84%
was telling him
about an incident.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:32.215 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, the son said,
I already know all about that.

00:26:32.215 --> 00:26:34.340 align:middle line:90%
He said that was my father.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Wow.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So there is indeed a
lady somewhere out there

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:43.970 align:middle line:84%
that knows, by fact,
that her husband has

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:45.830 align:middle line:90%
been killed by an ET being.

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: She passed away
some years ago, but yes.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:90%
The Air Force kept track of her.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:55.950 align:middle line:84%
They took care of her in a
number of different ways.

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't involved
in any of that.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:01.430 align:middle line:84%
I did part of the
investigations and that was it.

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:05.870 align:middle line:84%
My contact with her ended
when she signed some security

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:10.140 align:middle line:84%
oaths, non-disclosure
agreements, so to speak,

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:10.940 align:middle line:90%
with the Air Force.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.950 align:middle line:90%
And she never did talk about it.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Except for one time
when she mentioned it

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:18.860 align:middle line:84%
to somebody who eventually
mentioned it at a UFO

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.510 align:middle line:90%
convention some years later.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:25.190 align:middle line:84%
I think it was in the late
'90s and maybe early 2000s.

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And then Wendelle
Stevens, who, of course,

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:31.910 align:middle line:84%
the father of the UFO
recovery, so to speak,

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:34.460 align:middle line:90%
knew about the incident.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.590 align:middle line:84%
But other than that,
it's been kept secret

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:38.270 align:middle line:90%
for a number of years.

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Rick, quite some time
ago former US President Bill

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Clinton tried to get his hands
on information about Area 51.

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think he tried to
access the base as well.

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Do you think he has seen those
living beings down there?

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I know of the incident
where President Clinton back

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:03.680 align:middle line:84%
in the '90s, I think just a
couple of years after he became

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.370 align:middle line:84%
president after,
1993, '94 time frame,

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:10.550 align:middle line:84%
he asked one of his
aides by the name of Mr.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Podesta to go there
and see what's there.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Because he couldn't get
anyone within the Department

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:23.250 align:middle line:84%
of Defense or the
intelligence community

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.030 align:middle line:90%
to talk to him about it.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And so Podesta went there,
but he wasn't allowed in.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.290 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have, number
one, the clearance.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:36.840 align:middle line:90%
He didn't have the need to know.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And so he returned and told
President Clinton he didn't

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.440 align:middle line:90%
think anything was there.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Now John Podesta,
he's talked about

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.080 align:middle line:90%
this many, many, many times.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a YouTube video
out there some time ago

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:55.370 align:middle line:84%
where somebody was
talking to about that.

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I never
got the information

00:28:58.090 --> 00:28:59.780 align:middle line:90%
that the president wanted.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that we didn't
want that information.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.610 align:middle line:90%
We didn't want to know it.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And Bill Clinton, of course,
made some other statements

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:12.990 align:middle line:84%
years later on some
talk shows, nightly talk

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:16.140 align:middle line:90%
shows about this same thing.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And he admitted that, you
know, we're temporary.

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:84%
The President of the United
States, believe it or not,

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.230 align:middle line:84%
is a temporary employee
of the government.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:28.950 align:middle line:84%
He or she is there for
four years or maybe eight

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:33.570 align:middle line:84%
years, one term or two
terms, and then they leave.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:37.980 align:middle line:84%
There's people within the
government, MJ 12, the Advanced

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Operations Working
Group, people who

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.460 align:middle line:84%
were responsible for these
programs to keep them secret.

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we, the
United States government,

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:50.310 align:middle line:84%
when I worked there,
didn't want the community

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:54.790 align:middle line:84%
to know what was out
there or what was there.

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:57.030 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't just the ETs.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:00.420 align:middle line:84%
It was the reverse
engineering projects

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:04.380 align:middle line:84%
that I had also had access
to that were going on there

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:09.180 align:middle line:84%
both at Groom Lake,
Area 51, and at Tonopah.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Those things had
to remain secret.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And after this
incident, there's things

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:18.690 align:middle line:90%
that we had to do to cover up.

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And I use cover up not
loosely, but in a somewhat

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.950 align:middle line:90%
of a gross term for me now.

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.355 align:middle line:90%
I wish I hadn't.

00:30:27.355 --> 00:30:28.980 align:middle line:84%
But there were a lot
of people involved

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:32.330 align:middle line:90%
in this that weren't military.

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, there were military
and there weren't.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.560 align:middle line:84%
All the military
policemen were involved.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And there were, I
think, 20 some--

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:41.790 align:middle line:84%
there were teams like
their own SWAT teams

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:42.810 align:middle line:90%
people were out there.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Other people that were given
limited information that

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.250 align:middle line:84%
had to be out there, like
maintenance personnel

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:54.300 align:middle line:84%
that were already out there,
the civilian security force that

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.750 align:middle line:90%
guarded the outer perimeter.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And that was a Wackenhut
company that did that.

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:04.890 align:middle line:84%
We had to be responsible for
debriefing everybody that

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:09.390 align:middle line:84%
had any kind of access to
this, not even counting

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:12.540 align:middle line:84%
the civilian law enforcement
agencies that were involved

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.450 align:middle line:84%
in this, the Nye County
Sheriff's Deputies,

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:18.090 align:middle line:84%
the Nevada Highway
Patrol troopers

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:23.280 align:middle line:84%
that were involved in it, the
Nevada Game And Fish personnel

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.840 align:middle line:90%
that were involved.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, our information
to them was disinformation.

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:32.400 align:middle line:90%
We didn't tell anyone the truth.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:36.660 align:middle line:84%
The only person we told
the truth was the wife.

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Rick, a few years ago,
an infamous group on Facebook

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:46.050 align:middle line:84%
was talking about, you
know, storming into Area 51

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:50.280 align:middle line:84%
and seeing all these
live ET beings.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:55.020 align:middle line:84%
What would have happened, if
really, a large group of people

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:56.880 align:middle line:90%
would have stormed that area?

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And what do you think
what would have happened

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:06.600 align:middle line:84%
if they had acknowledged the
fact of the existence of life

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.260 align:middle line:84%
beings on the ground of the
United States of America?

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Of others, I was
actually out there during that

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:15.690 align:middle line:90%
time period.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Number one, there
was countless layers

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:21.150 align:middle line:84%
of security protecting
that base, not just

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:26.460 align:middle line:84%
civilian, outer law enforcement
agencies from all over Nevada,

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:30.280 align:middle line:84%
even Las Vegas Metropolitan
Police were up there.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.420 align:middle line:84%
There were literally hundreds
and hundreds of police officers

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:36.180 align:middle line:84%
on the outer
perimeter, not counting

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:39.870 align:middle line:84%
the near 1,000 troops,
army troops that

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:43.200 align:middle line:90%
were brought in inside Area 51.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.160 align:middle line:84%
The commander, a general,
a one-star general,

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:52.890 align:middle line:84%
at Nellis Air Force Base said it
would be impossible for anyone

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:57.970 align:middle line:84%
to have penetrated the base,
any portion of the base.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Now the perimeter of
the base is so far away

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.750 align:middle line:84%
from the actual cantonment
area of the base, where

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:06.180 align:middle line:84%
all the secrets
are, that they would

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:10.660 align:middle line:84%
have the gone miles, 30 to 40
miles to get into that area.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And there was so many
layers of security.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:13.870 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't going
to ever happen.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think the organizers
of that event realized it.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:20.220 align:middle line:90%
It was just a publicity stunt.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.070 align:middle line:84%
But to answer your
other question,

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:29.160 align:middle line:84%
there's been rumors from 1947
on about the United States

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.808 align:middle line:84%
government having in its
possession a live ET.

00:33:32.808 --> 00:33:35.790 align:middle line:90%


00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:42.390 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we had EBE 1 from
1947 to 1952 before he died

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:43.710 align:middle line:90%
was leaked.

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:48.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for Stan Friedman had
the little magazine article--

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember what
magazine it was--

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.430 align:middle line:90%
describing it.

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:55.080 align:middle line:84%
But everybody thought it was
a joke because it was actually

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.885 align:middle line:84%
promoting a movie
that was coming out,

00:33:57.885 --> 00:34:02.220 align:middle line:84%
UFOs or something,
some kind of UFO movie.

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.050 align:middle line:90%
So nobody took it serious.

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:05.400 align:middle line:90%
Nobody took it serious.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And in that article,
it was pretty

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:13.080 align:middle line:84%
detailed about where it crashed
and how it got to Los Alamos,

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.969 align:middle line:90%
but that was it.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:16.050 align:middle line:90%
Nobody believed it.

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:17.520 align:middle line:90%
And that was in 1954.

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.429 align:middle line:84%
Nobody, you know-- but
that was the truth.

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, there's
been a countless number

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:27.210 align:middle line:84%
of people coming
forth and saying we've

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:30.000 align:middle line:90%
had live ETs visiting Earth.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.780 align:middle line:84%
We've had crash sites
where we recovered

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.370 align:middle line:90%
live ETs from crash sites.

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:39.650 align:middle line:84%
The location where
they were taken

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:43.250 align:middle line:84%
wasn't necessarily
given, Area 51.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:48.739 align:middle line:84%
But people, once Area
51 started to surface

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:53.750 align:middle line:84%
in the late '80s
and the early '90s,

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.510 align:middle line:84%
even though the
government has never

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:59.810 align:middle line:84%
had an acknowledged
it until 2014,

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.030 align:middle line:84%
the CIA eventually
acknowledged that.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:03.770 align:middle line:84%
But during that
time period, people

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:06.770 align:middle line:84%
that lived around the
base knew of Area 51.

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:09.230 align:middle line:84%
If you went to a
rancher and you'd

ask him what's out there
at that closed base,

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.030 align:middle line:84%
he'd say, well, that's where
they keep all the flying

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:18.320 align:middle line:90%
saucers.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And that was a CBS
special that was

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:24.570 align:middle line:84%
done in '98, or '89, or '90,
sometime in that time period.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And then in 1994, the
United States government

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.700 align:middle line:84%
came in and seized
thousands of acres

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:36.590 align:middle line:84%
of land outside Nellis
Test and Training Range

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:38.870 align:middle line:90%
to even protect the area more.

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:43.340 align:middle line:84%
You used to be able to go to
the Freedom Peak, which was

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:48.080 align:middle line:90%
a close 20 miles from Area 51.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.150 align:middle line:84%
People would go up
there and take pictures.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Well then, they
eventually seized,

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:53.840 align:middle line:84%
the government
seized all that land.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.890 align:middle line:84%
It was government land
in the first place.

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So now you have to
go almost 60 miles up

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:05.060 align:middle line:84%
to a peak, Tikaboo Peak to
try to look inside Area 51.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So the government went
to an extraordinary means

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:16.550 align:middle line:84%
to protect the integrity and
the operations inside Area 51.
