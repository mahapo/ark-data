>>JAY WEIDNER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.310 align:middle line:90%
My name is Jay Weidner.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.580 align:middle line:10%
Today we have Tony
Rodrigues, who

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.790 align:middle line:10%
claims to have been the
Secret Space Program.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.590 align:middle line:10%
Hi, Tony.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.900 align:middle line:10%
>>TONY RODRIGUES: Hey, Jay.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.150 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: Tony, today I want
to talk about something that

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:10%
is probably the most mysterious
aspect of this whole Secret

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.660 align:middle line:10%
Space Program and a subject
that a lot of people

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.010 align:middle line:10%
have a lot of questions about,
and that is the 20 and back.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's start out with
you explaining to me

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.510 align:middle line:90%
what a 20 and back is.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Well, first, I'll
say that it's a mystery to me,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.830 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's baffling.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.350 align:middle line:84%
I try to put it
together as best I can.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.920 align:middle line:84%
The experience that
I went through,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.250 align:middle line:90%
I was a nine-year-old boy.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.349 align:middle line:84%
I was taken and then had
medical procedures done on me,

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.650 align:middle line:84%
and then lived 20
years, Mars, Ceres.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.397 align:middle line:90%
I lived a 20-year time.

00:01:11.397 --> 00:01:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Everybody on Ceres that
was there on a 20 and back

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.280 align:middle line:84%
was aware of how
much time they had.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Some people got
send-offs, parties.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Like toward the end of
somebody's 20 and back,

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.880 align:middle line:84%
you started doing
their work for them.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.000 align:middle line:84%
We were all aware that
we were going back.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.950 align:middle line:90%
And asked once.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.260 align:middle line:84%
I asked one of the reptiles
there, why 20 years?

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.550 align:middle line:90%
Why not 50?

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.170 align:middle line:90%
Why not more?

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And what he said was
that even other species,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.670 align:middle line:84%
all intelligent species,
he said that it had

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.930 align:middle line:90%
to be in 20-year increments.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Some can go more than
others genetically.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Some can do a 20 and back
and then a 20 and back.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.165 align:middle line:84%
And some other technology was 20
back and inside a 20 and back.

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:52.290 align:middle line:84%
But he said that it had to
be in 20-year increments

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:84%
because people
that stayed longer,

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.300 align:middle line:84%
it greatly increased your
probability of insanity

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.100 align:middle line:90%
by going back.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So 20 years was the
safe window of time

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:84%
to be outside of whatever
you were, and then put back

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.580 align:middle line:90%
in time.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.280 align:middle line:84%
So experiencing it,
I mean, not knowing

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.560 align:middle line:84%
how the technology worked,
I've heard other accounts of 20

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.360 align:middle line:90%
and backs.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there is
more than one way to do it.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.400 align:middle line:84%
There's more than one
technology to do it.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.820 align:middle line:84%
I think that my experience
was, they took my spark of life

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.860 align:middle line:84%
or my consciousness out
of me, at which point

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.720 align:middle line:84%
I became a vegetable,
or brain on the table.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.020 align:middle line:84%
They cloned me because I
had the genetics to do that,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.080 align:middle line:90%
and put me in that clone.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.827 align:middle line:84%
And it when it
finished its 20 years,

00:02:37.827 --> 00:02:39.660 align:middle line:84%
they put it back in
time because time travel

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.240 align:middle line:84%
is much easier than what
we are led to believe.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.010 align:middle line:84%
They took that
29-year-old version of me

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and put it back in time, and
then probably just killed it.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
have woke up, or did

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.380 align:middle line:84%
whatever they say, and
put me, my spark of life,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:84%
my consciousness back
into my original body.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up with my memories
and no memories of the 20

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:90%
and back.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:84%
I woke up on a table, and
they were, how do you feel?

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember anything?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.530 align:middle line:90%
And I said no.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And they said--
they laughed at me.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.738 align:middle line:90%
They laughed at me.

00:03:11.738 --> 00:03:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm going
to remember you guys.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell my
mom and dad about you.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.680 align:middle line:84%
They said no, you're
not going to remember.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.300 align:middle line:84%
They said, you've
already forgotten.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:90%
And they were laughing.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a room of ETs,
and they laughed.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.730 align:middle line:90%
And I got livid.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.092 align:middle line:90%
I got mad.

00:03:25.092 --> 00:03:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And they all stopped
and got funny.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And there was one on
a chronovisor looking

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.070 align:middle line:84%
into my probable futures, and he
told them all to knock it off.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Now look what you did.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I had to go to another
bout of mind control stuff.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.920 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't
remember any of that.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.330 align:middle line:84%
I was back to being
my normal self.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.570 align:middle line:84%
But then I woke up in
my bed the next morning,

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.740 align:middle line:90%
and I was different.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.420 align:middle line:90%
That's the other thing.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:90%
I was a different person.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.525 align:middle line:84%
The night before I was
a nine-year-old boy.

00:03:51.525 --> 00:03:52.900 align:middle line:84%
I was taken and
did a 20 and back

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.490 align:middle line:90%
and came back minutes later.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.040 align:middle line:84%
The morning I woke up, I had
no memories, really, of my 20

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.010 align:middle line:90%
and back.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.190 align:middle line:84%
But I was a completely
shattered person.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I was a different
person, different.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And my parents knew
it, my sister knew it.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And my dad routinely said, I
want my son back in the months

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.070 align:middle line:84%
after that, said
you're different.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.870 align:middle line:90%
I was changed.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.800 align:middle line:90%
I had lived that time.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.182 align:middle line:84%
I was attracted to adult
women all of a sudden.

00:04:17.182 --> 00:04:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I went to school
the next day and I

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.079 align:middle line:90%
thought my teacher was hot.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:20.890 align:middle line:90%
And I was nine.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.550 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have that before that.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.580 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have that
experience before that.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.410 align:middle line:90%
I was different.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to school
the next day, I asked

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.610 align:middle line:84%
to go to the bathroom later
on, about 1:00 in the day,

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and I said, where's
the bathroom?

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:90%
Because I'd forgotten it.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And when I sat down to breakfast
that morning at the table,

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.580 align:middle line:84%
I said, I feel like I haven't
seen you guys in years.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And my sister said,
shut up, stupid,

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.000 align:middle line:90%
you were just here yesterday.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.868 align:middle line:90%
Don't be stupid.

00:04:43.868 --> 00:04:45.410 align:middle line:84%
My parents were a
little freaked out.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.990 align:middle line:90%
They knew something was odd.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:84%
That morning, the whole
morning was awkward.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.450 align:middle line:90%
But it changed me.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You had like
a new maturity then.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nine years old,
being attracted to women.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I totally didn't
fit in with my social circle

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.980 align:middle line:90%
I was weird.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:84%
From that point on,
I was kind of off.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was very unconfident
of myself after being a slave

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.737 align:middle line:84%
and treated like
that for so long,

00:05:08.737 --> 00:05:09.820 align:middle line:90%
I still had that tendency.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.280 align:middle line:84%
I still had that
fear, inner fear

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.780 align:middle line:90%
of always being disciplined.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So you were shattered.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I was not
the same person, exactly.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.782 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did you have
any discipline problems

00:05:18.782 --> 00:05:20.940 align:middle line:84%
at that point, or
anything like that?

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Well, yeah.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.200 align:middle line:90%
Well, slightly things.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.480 align:middle line:84%
People raised their voice
to me, I would take it hard.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:90%
I still do.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.800 align:middle line:84%
If somebody talks to me like
I'm in trouble and I'm not,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.130 align:middle line:90%
I get really bent about it.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:90%
I still have problems.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.733 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Even to this day.

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Oh, yeah.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.860 align:middle line:90%
But I was a different person.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.822 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that was
what they wanted.

00:05:38.822 --> 00:05:40.780 align:middle line:84%
When I went to school,
that boy, the next week,

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.527 align:middle line:84%
and when we had our Wednesday
meeting, he knew it.

00:05:43.527 --> 00:05:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Like smirking at you, or?

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.693 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: He did.

00:05:45.693 --> 00:05:46.850 align:middle line:90%
He said, are you OK?

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.470 align:middle line:84%
He came up and he
said, are you OK?

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.290 align:middle line:90%
And I said why?

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Because I was still in
a competition with him,

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.840 align:middle line:90%
even though I really wasn't.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.300 align:middle line:84%
He said I heard you forgot
where the bathroom was.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:90%
Anything else?

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.707 align:middle line:90%
He said, are you OK?

00:06:00.707 --> 00:06:01.790 align:middle line:90%
I said yeah, I'll be fine.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.263 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:04.430 align:middle line:90%
I kept going back and forth.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.670 align:middle line:84%
We went back and forth
about it for a minute.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:07.640 align:middle line:90%
And he said it's OK.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.900 align:middle line:90%
You made a difference.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.070 align:middle line:90%
And I said what?

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.128 align:middle line:90%
He said you make a difference.

00:06:12.128 --> 00:06:13.170 align:middle line:90%
I said, what do you mean?

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.590 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, not you,
but your kids will.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.760 align:middle line:90%
That's what he told me.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And there was another boy
there in that class that said,

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.660 align:middle line:90%
was that real?

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.650 align:middle line:90%
Did that happen?

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:21.650 align:middle line:90%
And he said to him, yes.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.690 align:middle line:84%
He's like, you made
a difference, too.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.370 align:middle line:84%
There was another boy
that was taken in.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.717 align:middle line:90%
But he had his memories.

00:06:26.717 --> 00:06:28.800 align:middle line:84%
He could remember everything
right then and there.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.050 align:middle line:90%
So he was in a different role.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.490 align:middle line:90%
They were friends.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So he had a friend taken
and put through more

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:84%
of a positive experience
than what I went through

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.620 align:middle line:90%
as a enemy of his, that boy.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.000 align:middle line:90%
But he sat and talked to it.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And his attitude
towards me changed, too.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.500 align:middle line:84%
That was the end of
him really hating me,

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.750 align:middle line:84%
where he kind of
felt bad for me.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Obviously he had a
report of what happened.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.290 align:middle line:90%
So that's how that works.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.220 align:middle line:84%
So the 20 and back, I
get asked a lot about it.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Most people can't
think about that.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.163 align:middle line:84%
They go, well, if you were
gone for 20 years, what

00:06:59.163 --> 00:07:00.510 align:middle line:90%
were your parents thinking?

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.030 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is I was only
gone for a few minutes.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.930 align:middle line:84%
I was gone, went to a 20 and
back, then put back in time.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.548 align:middle line:90%
There is a time loop.

00:07:08.548 --> 00:07:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's what they
can get away with legally.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.260 align:middle line:84%
There are other,
more advanced ETs

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:18.040 align:middle line:84%
that police the time travel,
that police it in the universe.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.420 align:middle line:90%
So there are laws around it.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.790 align:middle line:90%
And 20 years is what happens.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So what
you think happened

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.635 align:middle line:84%
is that they created
a clone of you that

00:07:27.635 --> 00:07:29.010 align:middle line:84%
had to be nine
years old, so they

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:84%
had to grow that clone
before this moment.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I don't
think it took them long.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: There's a
quick-growing clone.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I think
they hammered out

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:37.450 align:middle line:90%
a clone in an hour.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: OK.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And then they took
your personality

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and put it in the clone, put
the clone into the 20 year

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.270 align:middle line:90%
and back program.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.600 align:middle line:90%
The clone came back.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.960 align:middle line:84%
They took the memories
out, put it back into you,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.218 align:middle line:90%
killed the clone.

00:07:50.218 --> 00:07:51.510 align:middle line:90%
That's what you think happened.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: That's what
I believe happened, yeah.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.205 align:middle line:84%
But I know I was
on the moon base

00:07:54.205 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:84%
because when I remembered we had
the issue with the chronovisor,

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.520 align:middle line:84%
they rolled me
into another office

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.370 align:middle line:84%
with a guy with a chronovisor,
and there was a window,

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.180 align:middle line:84%
and I could see the
surface of the moon.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.820 align:middle line:84%
It was a corner, like an
office, and I could see.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.190 align:middle line:90%
It was dark out.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.350 align:middle line:84%
They said that the sun did
come up there, weird hours,

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.848 align:middle line:90%
18 hours from now or something.

00:08:13.848 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:84%
But I could see the surface
of the moon out the window.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Remind me again,
what's a chronovisor?

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: A chronovisor was
a machine that only some of them

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:25.728 align:middle line:84%
could use that could look
at probable futures of me.

00:08:25.728 --> 00:08:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And they were looking
into my future.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.800 align:middle line:90%
They were showing me--

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.800 align:middle line:84%
they were trying to program
different futures for me.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.789 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't supposed to
remember the experience.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole
time, I was combative.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.107 align:middle line:84%
I was fighting the
process the whole time.

00:08:39.107 --> 00:08:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Get up on the table.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.740 align:middle line:84%
No, because I knew at that point
there was also a law in place

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.697 align:middle line:84%
they had to put me back
once the time ran out.

00:08:47.697 --> 00:08:48.780 align:middle line:90%
There was a law that said.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.940 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that I wasn't
going to be disciplined.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:51.840 align:middle line:90%
I could be combative.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Another guy that I rode
the disk back told me that.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.790 align:middle line:84%
He said, what are they
going to do to you?

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:90%
He was screaming at the pilot.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.415 align:middle line:84%
He said something
rude, you know?

00:08:59.415 --> 00:09:00.510 align:middle line:90%
FU to the pilot.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.850 align:middle line:84%
I said, stop it, you're
going to get in trouble.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:02.830 align:middle line:84%
He said what are
they going to do?

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:03.630 align:middle line:90%
They have to put us back.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.600 align:middle line:90%
Today's the day.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So there's a contract,
a contractual agreement,

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.620 align:middle line:84%
that they have to take
you back after 20 years.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Or-- yeah.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:84%
But that time they took me,
and there was one showing--

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.000 align:middle line:90%
he was trying to narrow it down.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.205 align:middle line:84%
I guess it was many
probable futures,

00:09:20.205 --> 00:09:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and they were trying to
narrow it down to one

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.498 align:middle line:90%
where I didn't cause trouble.

00:09:24.498 --> 00:09:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You think there was
any manipulation of you when

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.090 align:middle line:84%
you got back to make sure that
you stayed on that future?

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: After
I got back, there

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.010 align:middle line:84%
were a few weird
things that happened.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:39.070 align:middle line:84%
A few days later, I woke up in
the middle of the night and I

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.900 align:middle line:90%
ran as fast as I could--

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.510 align:middle line:84%
you know, I was
upstairs in a farmhouse.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.740 align:middle line:90%
I ran as fast as I could.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.152 align:middle line:90%
I had no reason why.

00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I went as fast as I
could down the stairs

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.403 align:middle line:84%
and ran out the front door into
a van where men were waiting.

00:09:52.403 --> 00:09:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: This is
after you got back?

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: After I got back.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And they did some
kind of follow-up.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.260 align:middle line:84%
I got in the van and I
went right to sleep again,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and then woke up the
next morning in my bed.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.230 align:middle line:90%
It was a follow-up checkup.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.120 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
that happened was,

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.530 align:middle line:84%
I lived in a kind
of a smaller town.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And we went out to a smaller
town to a family doctor.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And they called my mom, and
there was some kind of offer,

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.290 align:middle line:84%
like it was a free test or
something they enticed her

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.740 align:middle line:90%
to bring me in for a checkup.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And when I got there,
there was a guy there,

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.720 align:middle line:84%
a younger guy that was a
brain surgeon or something way

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.070 align:middle line:90%
qualified.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.940 align:middle line:84%
They basically had us
come in for a checkup,

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.440 align:middle line:84%
and the entire
checkup, when I went,

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.880 align:middle line:84%
in was not breathing
with a stethoscope

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.560 align:middle line:90%
or checking my pulse.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.690 align:middle line:90%
He did none of that.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.357 align:middle line:84%
The only thing he asked me is if
I had any weird, strange dreams

00:10:44.357 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:90%
lately.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:84%
He got me in the room alone,
which also is strange.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.730 align:middle line:84%
He said, have you had
any strange dreams?

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.030 align:middle line:90%
What have you been dreaming?

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.050 align:middle line:90%
I was terrified of him.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.970 align:middle line:90%
It was creepy.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said nothing,
just normal stuff.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.560 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, really,
think about it.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.400 align:middle line:90%
You can tell me.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Were you dreaming?

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: No.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: You weren't.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.330 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Yeah.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, no.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.380 align:middle line:84%
But he was asking me if I
remembered what was going on,

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.342 align:middle line:90%
what happened.

00:11:07.342 --> 00:11:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said no and then
he checked me out,

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.340 align:middle line:90%
and that was the end of it.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:84%
So there were a
couple of follow-ups

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.360 align:middle line:84%
there right after
that that were weird.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.160 align:middle line:90%
It was weird.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.827 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Anything else
weird happen to you

00:11:17.827 --> 00:11:18.980 align:middle line:90%
since you've been back?

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.350 align:middle line:90%
Like-- nothing?

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.505 align:middle line:90%
No strange visits?

00:11:25.505 --> 00:11:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Tons of stuff.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.990 align:middle line:90%
I kind of figured, yeah.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.630 align:middle line:90%
So they're keeping tabs on you.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Yeah.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:34.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:38.840 align:middle line:84%
I believe I was taken
and interrogated in 2016.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Oh, really?

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.590 align:middle line:90%
After you came out?

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Yeah.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Before, right before I came out.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I thought you
came out in 2015.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: No,
just the researchers.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Oh, you had your
memories return in 2015.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.558 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: My
memories got back--

00:11:51.558 --> 00:11:56.340 align:middle line:84%
I recovered the bulk of
my memories in May of '15.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And I started emailing some
researchers looking for help.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.310 align:middle line:90%
I wanted counseling.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was in that
time that I believe

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I was taken and
interrogated, and put back.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.080 align:middle line:90%
And so that was another thing.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Like during the interrogation,
they had tied my arms out

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:15.938 align:middle line:90%
straight to the seats.

00:12:15.938 --> 00:12:17.730 align:middle line:84%
There was a row seats,
and they tied me out

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.710 align:middle line:90%
and were giving me injections.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And they went on for
something like 18 hours.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.390 align:middle line:90%
They kept me awake.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I kept
saying, come on, guys,

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.635 align:middle line:84%
I'm being completely honest
with you about everything.

00:12:28.635 --> 00:12:29.990 align:middle line:90%
And I was.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.810 align:middle line:90%
And it was vague.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.700 align:middle line:90%
It was very vague.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.130 align:middle line:84%
They did a good job at
the memory blanking.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
very end when they

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.160 align:middle line:90%
said, OK, we'll let you go.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.172 align:middle line:84%
We're going to let you
get some sleep now.

00:12:41.172 --> 00:12:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up the next
morning in my bed.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.960 align:middle line:84%
So there was a time
travel that time as well.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, let's talk about
other kinds of 20 and back.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.200 align:middle line:84%
I've heard of other
kinds in my research.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.902 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what you found.

00:12:54.902 --> 00:12:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I have
vague memories.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not all the timeline that
I have for whatever reason.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.020 align:middle line:84%
But they remember something,
and then it makes sense.

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:06.565 align:middle line:84%
And what I've found is that
I can usually ask them, well,

00:13:06.565 --> 00:13:07.440 align:middle line:90%
when did that happen?

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.742 align:middle line:90%
When did it start?

00:13:08.742 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And they can usually give me
an age, like when I was a kid,

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.210 align:middle line:90%
this happened.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well,
how old are you now?

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:16.490 align:middle line:90%
And then they let me know.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, when you were
35, then, was 20 years later,

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:20.928 align:middle line:90%
what happened then?

00:13:20.928 --> 00:13:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's oh, that's
when I met my wife, that's

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.070 align:middle line:84%
when I got my new
job, and that's

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.330 align:middle line:90%
when I finally settled down.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's usually a
life-changing event.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.370 align:middle line:84%
There's usually an
event of weirdness.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:32.537 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: At the 20-year point.

00:13:32.537 --> 00:13:34.662 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Well, there's
usually an initial event

00:13:34.662 --> 00:13:35.720 align:middle line:90%
that people remember.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:39.230 align:middle line:84%
I remembered my abduction
the whole time, clearly.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.910 align:middle line:90%
That memory didn't get erased.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:84%
When I woke up with the gray,
I always had that memory,

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.487 align:middle line:90%
and I always looked for ufology.

00:13:46.487 --> 00:13:47.570 align:middle line:90%
I always looked for stuff.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was the kid that got
drunk at the party and said,

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I was abducted by aliens
because I remembered

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:90%
being taken and put back.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.640 align:middle line:90%
I didn't remember the 20 years.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.780 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know when that could
have happened because I also

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.665 align:middle line:90%
had a chronological 20 years.

00:14:01.665 --> 00:14:04.040 align:middle line:84%
What I found was that there's
always a creepy event where

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:04.850 align:middle line:90%
someone gets taken.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.497 align:middle line:90%
They usually remember it.

00:14:06.497 --> 00:14:07.580 align:middle line:90%
They forget what happened.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
happened after that.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I go, well, let's roll
the clock forward 20 years.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.480 align:middle line:90%
What happened then in your life?

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's usually something
there life-changing,

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.520 align:middle line:84%
like there's usually
a life-changing thing.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, at 29,
what happened to you?

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.780 align:middle line:90%
That would be 20 years.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:25.140 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I was
a screw-up, man.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Every time I got
a girlfriend, it

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.255 align:middle line:84%
was like I was just
an emotional wreck.

00:14:34.255 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:84%
That whole time I couldn't
keep a girlfriend.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.870 align:middle line:90%
I was just weird.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:42.660 align:middle line:90%
And then one day in 2000--

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.120 align:middle line:84%
was right around
2000, 2001, 2000--

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.118 align:middle line:84%
I woke up and I just
told myself, it's over.

00:14:49.118 --> 00:14:50.410 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know why I did it.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I just woke up in the morning,
felt like a million bucks.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.900 align:middle line:84%
I felt like a million bucks, and
I said, it's over, it's over,

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.418 align:middle line:90%
it's over.

00:14:57.418 --> 00:14:59.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it wasn't but a couple
of months later I met my wife,

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.673 align:middle line:84%
and I had a great
relationship since.

00:15:02.673 --> 00:15:03.590 align:middle line:90%
I could make it stick.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.132 align:middle line:84%
It was my next relationship,
and I was able to make it stick.

00:15:06.132 --> 00:15:10.640 align:middle line:84%
I was sharing the trauma,
that existence with myself,

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.023 align:middle line:90%
during the 20 and back.

00:15:12.023 --> 00:15:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I think when people have
a 20 and back, you're

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.070 align:middle line:84%
living it with
yourself, and it's

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.950 align:middle line:84%
like twins, where if
one gets a broken arm,

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.390 align:middle line:84%
the other one has a
sore arm kind of thing.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.218 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Yeah, it's called
quantum entanglement in physics.

00:15:24.218 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: So I
think I was sharing

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.950 align:middle line:84%
that mentality of a
slave, of a person that

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:33.140 align:middle line:84%
had been broken and been
through that kind of trauma.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.500 align:middle line:90%
I was sharing that.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And then when it was
over, I was myself.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.270 align:middle line:90%
I was whole again.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.160 align:middle line:90%
And I started to heal.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.110 align:middle line:90%
And it was years after 2000.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.850 align:middle line:84%
It was 2015 before
I really got--

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:46.880 align:middle line:84%
every year I kind of
got better after that.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.350 align:middle line:84%
I kind of got better
professionally in my working.

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:52.700 align:middle line:84%
I got better in my
relationships with my friends.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.367 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So your whole
life just improved.

00:15:54.367 --> 00:15:55.492 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: It got better.

00:15:55.492 --> 00:15:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Your jobs got better and
your friendships got better?

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: It just shows that
those 20 years of my younger

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.470 align:middle line:84%
years, there was really
nothing wrong with my life,

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.740 align:middle line:84%
but I still didn't
have it together.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.130 align:middle line:90%
And I don't want to push blame.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm me.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.450 align:middle line:84%
But it all went away after
the 20-year span went away.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow, that's heavy.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any idea
why they would put you

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.110 align:middle line:84%
through so much pain
before they sent you back?

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.880 align:middle line:90%
Is it part of the process, or--

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.255 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Every
time there was

00:16:22.255 --> 00:16:25.770 align:middle line:84%
something painful done to me,
and I said, this is ridiculous.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:26.880 align:middle line:90%
You guys can't do this.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.460 align:middle line:84%
If there was a complaint, a
peep out of me, they said,

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:84%
don't worry, you're not
going to remember anyway.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:33.030 align:middle line:90%
There was no anesthesia.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.270 align:middle line:84%
There was no wasting
money or resources

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.680 align:middle line:84%
on giving me an anesthetic
because I wasn't going

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.550 align:middle line:90%
to remember the procedure.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.793 align:middle line:84%
So things were very painful,
and whenever they did that,

00:16:44.793 --> 00:16:46.710 align:middle line:84%
they kind of beat you
over the head with that.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:47.540 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to remember anyway.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.420 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:52.020 align:middle line:84%
You won't remember, while
you're screaming in pain.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:84%
So that was a
battle cry of them.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.495 align:middle line:84%
That's how they justify treating
people like that out there.

00:16:58.495 --> 00:17:00.120 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
remember it anyway.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.870 align:middle line:84%
Put yourself in the
shoes of somebody that

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.630 align:middle line:90%
can do that to somebody else.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.700 align:middle line:84%
It won't be long before
it's a slippery slope,

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:10.500 align:middle line:84%
and even you would lose some
morality in that situation.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I believe you told me
that you had taken an MRI,

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and that this was the
beginning of your recovering

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:17.690 align:middle line:90%
your memories?

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:20.107 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I had always had
the memories of being taken.

00:17:20.107 --> 00:17:22.079 align:middle line:84%
And I knew something was
wrong with the world.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:25.800 align:middle line:84%
I knew that there were
aliens, ETs, amongst now.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.630 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I was
taken, and I knew that I

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:middle line:90%
had medical procedures done.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I went back and
was awkward those next days.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.470 align:middle line:90%
So I always checked into that.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I would frequently have
memories that are not dreams.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:40.930 align:middle line:84%
In a dream, you're
standing there,

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.605 align:middle line:84%
and you're standing
in your field,

00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:45.230 align:middle line:84%
and you have no idea
how you got there.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.647 align:middle line:84%
If you become lucid
in your dream,

00:17:46.647 --> 00:17:50.570 align:middle line:84%
you have no memory of your
walking to the field you're in,

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:51.700 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.760 align:middle line:84%
In my memories of my 20
and back that bled through,

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.270 align:middle line:84%
I had memory of how I got there,
of the trip, of the walking

00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.830 align:middle line:90%
up the ramp to get there.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.630 align:middle line:84%
I had previous memories,
and I had memories

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.160 align:middle line:90%
of where I went after that.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.540 align:middle line:90%
I had a line.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.010 align:middle line:90%
But I had no idea--

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I didn't take into account
the time travel aspect.

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:10.940 align:middle line:90%
And I had no idea.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.030 align:middle line:84%
I thought, when could
I have done that?

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:15.370 align:middle line:84%
When was I standing on a
ship looking out the window

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.280 align:middle line:90%
at a geyser on Ceres?

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.480 align:middle line:90%
There was a geyser.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.940 align:middle line:84%
It was beautiful, and
I remembered it always.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:22.857 align:middle line:90%
I never forgot it.

00:18:22.857 --> 00:18:24.190 align:middle line:90%
But when could I have done that?

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:27.175 align:middle line:84%
I had full memories
of my whole life,

00:18:27.175 --> 00:18:29.300 align:middle line:84%
you know, every day of
getting up, going to school,

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.405 align:middle line:84%
going to work, going out with
my friends, going to see movies.

00:18:32.405 --> 00:18:33.280 align:middle line:90%
I had those memories.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.730 align:middle line:84%
So when could I have had a
career as a cargo engineer?

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.680 align:middle line:90%
So I just brushed it off.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:43.630 align:middle line:84%
In May of 2015, I went to
the doctor for headaches

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and she prescribed me
to get a MRI of my head.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And about two weeks after
that is when they hit me.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:53.690 align:middle line:84%
All the memories, big
chunks of the memories came.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And then once I accepted it and
went, oh my god, that's real,

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.150 align:middle line:90%
then more memories came.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, I'm
still remembering.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Your memories
came in like a flood,

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.130 align:middle line:90%
then, at that point.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Giant
chunks of memories.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And then you were
connecting one thing

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:06.340 align:middle line:90%
after another.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.923 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Sometimes
it was painful.

00:19:07.923 --> 00:19:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Like sometimes I had to stop
in my tracks and deal with it.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.570 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's like huge.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Like they would compress,
decompress, just giant chunks

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:18.540 align:middle line:90%
of memories.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And it would take me a
week or two afterwards

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:21.210 align:middle line:90%
of just sorting them out.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.300 align:middle line:84%
I'd sit and ponder
it, and I had no one

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.390 align:middle line:84%
to talk to about it, which
was really difficult.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And I reached out
to some researchers,

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.120 align:middle line:84%
not because I wanted to come
forward and do interviews

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:37.380 align:middle line:84%
or because I wanted to jump
into the fray or prove anything.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.380 align:middle line:90%
I wanted counseling.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.600 align:middle line:84%
I knew I was screwed
up at this point,

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.352 align:middle line:84%
that I had a condition
that I had never heard of.

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And there were others.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: And there
were a few others, exactly,

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:49.460 align:middle line:90%
that made it sound real.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.120 align:middle line:90%
This was in April, March of '15.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I reached out to
people in the UFO field

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.940 align:middle line:84%
because I knew I couldn't go
to a traditional counseling.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.008 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
tell me I'm crazy.

00:20:01.008 --> 00:20:02.300 align:middle line:90%
So I reached out to UFO people.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.140 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be other people
I can speak to about this.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And how did the
UFO community respond?

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: By grilling
me intensely with questions

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.770 align:middle line:90%
for over a year.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I had researchers just
grill me about things

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and not want to work with me,
not believe things I said.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And in the first
year of remembering,

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:27.380 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of the times wrong
and a lot of the memories

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.970 align:middle line:84%
wrong, a lot of
the details wrong

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.560 align:middle line:90%
because they were just new.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.700 align:middle line:84%
As time went on, I've been
able to put it together.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:37.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm still putting it together,
things that have happened.

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I think there's a
lot of people suffering

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.690 align:middle line:84%
from trauma that were in
the same kind of programs

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:42.620 align:middle line:90%
you were in.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.650 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important for
us to take the responsibility

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and help those people
because it could, in the end,

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.710 align:middle line:84%
be very, very traumatizing to
these people, these victims

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.200 align:middle line:90%
of this Secret Space Program.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Absolutely.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.658 align:middle line:84%
The worst thing
that happened to me

00:20:55.658 --> 00:20:57.710 align:middle line:84%
was being criticized
in the beginning.

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to say that since
my first interviews came out,

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:07.280 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten two to four people
a week that have contacted me.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm into the hundreds.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: People in the programs?

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Of people that
remember something weird,

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.677 align:middle line:84%
of people that have
fragmented memories.

00:21:13.677 --> 00:21:15.490 align:middle line:90%
I call it fragmented memories.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.390 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And I've also been able to put
everybody into three categories

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:25.130 align:middle line:84%
that I work with,
that I've talked to.

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:26.750 align:middle line:84%
There are people
that you can put them

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:31.430 align:middle line:84%
in the category of being dealt
with by a human secret space

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:32.910 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:36.410 align:middle line:84%
So the MILABs, Solar
Warden, they're taken,

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:40.070 align:middle line:84%
and it's humans that
take them, and they

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:43.070 align:middle line:84%
go through a 20 and
back, or x amount of time

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.200 align:middle line:90%
and do something.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Some women are being
used, harvested

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.580 align:middle line:90%
for breeding purposes.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:84%
There are all kinds
of things going

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.940 align:middle line:90%
on it's not all the same thing.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's one category
is a human SSP.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.460 align:middle line:84%
The other category
is a Draco SSP,

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.560 align:middle line:84%
that they went to
the trapezoid base.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's always some
kind of vampire thing.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.600 align:middle line:84%
It's always some kind of they
were hooked up to a machine

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.160 align:middle line:84%
and drained of
something, or they

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.980 align:middle line:90%
were used to have children.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.510 align:middle line:90%
And those were reptiles.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:15.470 align:middle line:84%
They were into a
Draco empire SSP.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.640 align:middle line:84%
The third category
is everybody else.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.562 align:middle line:84%
There are visiting SSP, people
that have been contacted by--

00:22:21.562 --> 00:22:22.770 align:middle line:90%
and not always something bad.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.270 align:middle line:84%
I met one girl that said
they fixed her teeth.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.290 align:middle line:84%
She had bad teeth, and
they took her on board,

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:29.373 align:middle line:90%
and they were helping her.

00:22:29.373 --> 00:22:30.832 align:middle line:84%
And she helped them
with something,

00:22:30.832 --> 00:22:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and they fixed her
teeth and put her back.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.200 align:middle line:90%
So this is a visiting SSP.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.250 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
the scale, the scope,

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:39.200 align:middle line:84%
first, if you imagine
the universe is

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.430 align:middle line:84%
full of billions and trillions
of sentient civilizations,

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.290 align:middle line:90%
of other people--

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:84%
versions of people that are a
person fish or a person rat--

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:90%
billions.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.630 align:middle line:84%
They're all visiting here
doing their own thing.

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's why all the
accounts of the people that

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.690 align:middle line:84%
are coming forward, when they
say that something happened,

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.500 align:middle line:84%
sound like gibberish
compared to the other people.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.630 align:middle line:90%
So I was dealt with a human SSP.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I make sense
along that rule of people

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.020 align:middle line:90%
that have dealt in SSP.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.480 align:middle line:84%
But other people are just
having psychic contact.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.570 align:middle line:84%
There is no physical
contact, but they're having

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:16.885 align:middle line:90%
out of body psychic contact.

00:23:16.885 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean they're
not having contact

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.060 align:middle line:84%
because it has nothing to
do with what I went through.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:24.780 align:middle line:84%
It means that it's somebody
else contacting them.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Is there a
point to all of this?

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Billions of points.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:31.550 align:middle line:90%
That's why.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.092 align:middle line:84%
That's why it doesn't
make sense when

00:23:33.092 --> 00:23:36.260 align:middle line:84%
you listen to Tom's story
versus Jane's story.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.507 align:middle line:84%
They're totally different,
but they're ETs.

00:23:38.507 --> 00:23:39.590 align:middle line:90%
They're extra terrestrial.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got to
think that's a great reason

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.137 align:middle line:84%
to lock us up and keep
it a secret from us,

00:23:45.137 --> 00:23:46.970 align:middle line:84%
so that they can get
to any point they want.

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:51.890 align:middle line:84%
We're a blank slate if you have
no knowledge of life out there.

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: What would you like to
see happen in this situation?

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Disclosure.

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:57.890 align:middle line:84%
I'd like the world
to have access

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.260 align:middle line:84%
to the interplanetary
database so that people

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.980 align:middle line:90%
can learn on their own.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.400 align:middle line:84%
There's an internet
that's between planets,

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.440 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to see the world
have access to that freely,

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.368 align:middle line:84%
and just us to be respected by
the people that are running us.

00:24:11.368 --> 00:24:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Will there ever
be a time when we're

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.350 align:middle line:90%
accepted as equals in this?

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: We are equals,
whether we accept it or not.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.030 align:middle line:84%
We're sentient,
and we deserve it.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:23.430 align:middle line:90%
We deserve freedom.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
blissfully ignorant.

The people that are
doing well in this system

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:30.462 align:middle line:84%
that we're in on Earth
don't want to change it.

00:24:30.462 --> 00:24:31.920 align:middle line:84%
People that are
well-off don't want

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.650 align:middle line:84%
to enter a system where
the poor people suddenly

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:39.270 align:middle line:84%
have the same method of
transport, the same freedoms

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.920 align:middle line:90%
that wealth gives you.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Those people don't
want to change.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.380 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
hear anything about it.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.540 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to hear it.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Are we slaves
on this planet?

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: We are
most certainly slaves.

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.903 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Is there a way
to emancipate ourselves?

00:24:51.903 --> 00:24:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: I'd
like to think so.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.772 align:middle line:90%
I think about it quite a bit.

00:24:54.772 --> 00:24:55.980 align:middle line:90%
I think about it quite a bit.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.560 align:middle line:84%
There's gotta be a way
to force disclosure.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.442 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Do you think disclosure
will cause emancipation?

00:25:01.442 --> 00:25:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: It has to.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.040 align:middle line:84%
It has to be the first
domino in the chain.

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.130 align:middle line:90%
It has to begin somewhere.

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So do you
think that we'll have

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.780 align:middle line:90%
free energy after disclosure?

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: We should.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:17.480 align:middle line:84%
The free energy was
limited on Ceres colony.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.530 align:middle line:84%
They had like a generator
that was every so often.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.380 align:middle line:84%
There was a-- there was
a limit to their power,

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.780 align:middle line:84%
to their energy output on Ceres
colony from the free energy

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:28.580 align:middle line:90%
equipment.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Really?

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Yes.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:34.848 align:middle line:84%
And so it's possible,
but it's not an endless--

00:25:34.848 --> 00:25:36.140 align:middle line:90%
there's a limit to free energy.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a limit to
the power output

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.680 align:middle line:84%
that each free energy
unit can give us.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.097 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And they had to be used
in a lot of power on Ceres.

00:25:42.097 --> 00:25:44.013 align:middle line:84%
>>RODRIGUES: Exactly,
which is what I marveled

00:25:44.013 --> 00:25:45.260 align:middle line:90%
at about the gravity plates.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.356 align:middle line:84%
Well, this was a very
interesting conversation.

00:25:49.356 --> 00:25:52.722 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you for coming
forth and telling us everything

00:25:52.722 --> 00:25:53.680 align:middle line:90%
that you're telling us.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.847 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: You're welcome.

00:25:54.847 --> 00:25:56.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to be able to talk.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to say
that a lot of things

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:01.300 align:middle line:84%
I speculate, it's
my version of events

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.870 align:middle line:84%
from my perspective
of the events.

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
argue with anybody

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:07.723 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't believe it.

00:26:07.723 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:84%
I just like to put it
out there so that people

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.560 align:middle line:84%
have something to
build on in the future

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.910 align:middle line:90%
when there is a disclosure.

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Or when somebody
else comes forward,

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to think that I
have put forth evidence

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:19.090 align:middle line:90%
that can just be built on.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.200 align:middle line:90%
I know that I don't know it all.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.040 align:middle line:90%
And I'm 46 now.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.020 align:middle line:90%
I was taken when I was nine.

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:28.450 align:middle line:84%
What was that, 37 years ago,
is how vague my memories are.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't be
surprised if I'm

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.010 align:middle line:90%
wrong about a detail or two.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And I have to believe that the
space time memories are just

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.310 align:middle line:90%
as accurate.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:38.295 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Well, you're
really a brave guy,

00:26:38.295 --> 00:26:39.170 align:middle line:90%
and we appreciate it.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have
further conversations with you

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:42.110 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.910 align:middle line:90%
Thanks a lot.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RODRIGUES: Thank.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:46.030 align:middle line:90%
You're very welcome.

and it just snapped
over, grabbed her legs,

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.950 align:middle line:90%
and sucked her right in.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:12.430 align:middle line:84%
