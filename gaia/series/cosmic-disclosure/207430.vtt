00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we're at an undisclosed

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:10%
location with Tim.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.730 align:middle line:10%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.600 align:middle line:10%
who analyzes and suggests
various strategies in relation

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.440 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial groups
in contact with Earth.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.750 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>> It's good to be here.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about cosmic law
versus the law of the first

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:90%
order.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.020 align:middle line:90%
How would you define them?

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And in what way
are they relevant?

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So law is defined as rules of
a community that are recognized

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.360 align:middle line:90%
as binding.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.040 align:middle line:84%
On Earth we have a local law
system, or a planetary law

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.220 align:middle line:84%
system, and this one
is not homogeneous,

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:84%
which means there are states,
and regions, and countries that

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.250 align:middle line:90%
have different sets of laws.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.890 align:middle line:84%
These all are
artificial law systems

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.580 align:middle line:84%
which are basically
regulating the way people come

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.890 align:middle line:90%
together and behave together.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:84%
But there's also something
natural, which is cosmic law.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Cosmic law is the
accumulation of all the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.540 align:middle line:84%
naturally occurring
dynamics, and laws, and rules

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.740 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:41.510 align:middle line:84%
That includes physics,
but also some parts

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.040 align:middle line:84%
that come from the
psychology of the universe,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.010 align:middle line:84%
from the consciousness
itself, how it behaves

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.140 align:middle line:90%
and how it's structured.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.340 align:middle line:84%
In this version of the universe
that we're in right now,

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.670 align:middle line:84%
every consciousness
unit, or CU, has

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.330 align:middle line:84%
allowance to do whatever
they want to experience.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Because probabilities
define what

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.660 align:middle line:84%
is possible in this universe
and every probability

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.820 align:middle line:90%
wants to play itself out.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.980 align:middle line:84%
So one example
would be violence.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of cosmic
law, the universe

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.640 align:middle line:84%
is experiencing itself in
the most ugly, and unhealthy,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.080 align:middle line:84%
and rough way possible, but
it's still probabilities

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.640 align:middle line:90%
that are played out.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:84%
On Earth we have this
artificial law system,

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.120 align:middle line:84%
which means that a third
consciousness level is trying

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.300 align:middle line:84%
to deal with all these
problematic systems

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.330 align:middle line:90%
and problematic experiences.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.770 align:middle line:84%
How do we socially
structure ourselves

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.380 align:middle line:84%
in order to have a kind
of fair system socially?

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And that means that they, A,
prohibit certain things, and B,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.370 align:middle line:90%
prosecute them.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.850 align:middle line:84%
But prosecution
makes things worse.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:11.470 align:middle line:84%
It's more unhealthy because you
put guilt and loathing to it.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.340 align:middle line:84%
That means that when
the universe wants

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.250 align:middle line:84%
to experience certain
things and this

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.050 align:middle line:84%
adds to the amount of
experiences the universe can

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.010 align:middle line:84%
make and this is good
because it creates diversity,

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:84%
it kind of blames itself for
this very natural behavior

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.560 align:middle line:90%
and that makes it worse.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Prosecuting behavior does not
make that behavior go away,

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:84%
because the probability
and the experience

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.940 align:middle line:84%
orientation of the
universe does not vanish,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.770 align:middle line:84%
it does not fade
by prosecuting it.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:01.030 align:middle line:84%
It just creates an unhealthy way
to define and to look upon it.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.280 align:middle line:84%
If you're thinking
about the term "karma,"

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.330 align:middle line:84%
if you want to think
in those terms,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.770 align:middle line:84%
then there are three ways
for dissolution of karma.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
The first one is
self-determination,

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.810 align:middle line:84%
which is an intellectual
way and an approach in what

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.529 align:middle line:84%
to do with those
self-destructive and unhealthy

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:90%
behaviorisms.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:29.020 align:middle line:84%
That means that you, A, have
to constantly remind yourself,

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and B, train yourself
to be a better person.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.270 align:middle line:84%
The second way is
self-realization,

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.400 align:middle line:84%
which means that you
do it by heart, if you

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.050 align:middle line:90%
want that analogy.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.470 align:middle line:84%
It also means that you're not
only doing the right thing,

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.620 align:middle line:84%
but it's within yourself,
within your being

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.330 align:middle line:90%
to do the right thing.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is something that
needs a lot of experience

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.770 align:middle line:90%
to come to that point naturally.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not an
intellectual approach,

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.260 align:middle line:84%
but it's something that
comes from deep within.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:84%
The third way to dissolve
karma is the reframe

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:90%
and let it play out factor.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is when the law of
the first order kicks in.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.330 align:middle line:84%
It means to put a
self-destructive behaviorism

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.890 align:middle line:90%
into a voluntary self-harm.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.670 align:middle line:84%
For example, boxing,
this is defined

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.010 align:middle line:90%
as a voluntary self-harm.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And when we add to that
and we go, for example,

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.820 align:middle line:84%
to aggressive rivalry,
then we could reframe it

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:49.240 align:middle line:84%
by the terms of the first order
into a more useful competition.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Which is different to local
law because local law would

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.450 align:middle line:84%
prosecute, for
example, cheating,

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and that is not the case in
the law of the first order.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Because cheating is a part
of this useful, playful

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:90%
competition.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.880 align:middle line:84%
It's just to make
things more accessible.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.880 align:middle line:84%
It's more or less
Darwinistic law

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.060 align:middle line:84%
as well to say, oh,
I found a smarter way

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.180 align:middle line:90%
to move around certain things.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And if the approach and the
target that is approached

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:34.370 align:middle line:84%
is benevolent and good for
a civilization, for example,

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.300 align:middle line:84%
it totally makes sense to move
around certain regulations.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>> One would think evolved
consciousness would not want

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.190 align:middle line:84%
to inflict a lower frequency
vibration into its own self.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Why do they do that?

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It means there is probability
in the universe and those

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.770 align:middle line:84%
probabilities want to
come into existence.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe
in terms of cosmic law

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.970 align:middle line:84%
do not see a good or a bad
side, they have experiences.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
experience things.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.350 align:middle line:84%
But when you're talking about
higher consciousness and lower

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.160 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, then this
is a term of evolution

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.450 align:middle line:90%
and we see that.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:23.690 align:middle line:84%
The more evolved a species gets,
the more it adapts to its rules

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and eventually comes
to a point where

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.760 align:middle line:84%
they stop every
self-destructive behavior.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.260 align:middle line:84%
But we see that in
the animal kingdom

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and we also see that in
the lower third level

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And we also see that in
level four consciousness

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.330 align:middle line:84%
as well, although those
beings still already know

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.420 align:middle line:84%
that we are one, but that
doesn't mean that conflicts are

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.210 align:middle line:90%
going to stop until level five.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Why in this example would
source consciousness choose

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.770 align:middle line:84%
violence, pain, and
hurtful experiences?

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:90%
>> For two reasons.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:07.840 align:middle line:84%
First, it's probabilities and
it's experiencing something.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if it's
bad, or good, or something, it

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.380 align:middle line:84%
just adds up to the overall
experience of the universe

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.450 align:middle line:90%
and that makes it valuable.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing is that
it's a term of consciousness.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.190 align:middle line:84%
While at the lower
end of consciousness,

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:30.040 align:middle line:84%
for example, in
animal kingdoms you

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.799 align:middle line:84%
have this survival
thing going on.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And every animal has a sense
of what can I do to survive?

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.330 align:middle line:90%
What can I do to eat?

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.130 align:middle line:90%
What can I do to pair?

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Those are the three
important questions

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.400 align:middle line:84%
to every animal on the second
level of consciousness.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And third consciousness,
we're talking about the ego,

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.640 align:middle line:84%
becoming a self,
asking, what am I?

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And that means also-- and this
is a very popular theory--

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.950 align:middle line:90%
who's the other self?

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:07.850 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And that brings
conflict as well.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So regulations are something
very basic to the third level

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.680 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.180 align:middle line:84%
In level four consciousness,
we all intellectually

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:27.310 align:middle line:84%
know that we are connected,
but we do not still

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:31.990 align:middle line:84%
experience that in a very
profound and believable way.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:36.580 align:middle line:84%
So that doesn't mean that
conflicts end in level four.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.500 align:middle line:84%
It is level five
of consciousness

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:43.090 align:middle line:84%
where we all experience
oneness and connectivity.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, all
these problematic and

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:52.090 align:middle line:84%
self-destructive
behaviors come to an end

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and also those beings are
consciousness units that

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.970 align:middle line:84%
cling to self-destructive
behavior,

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.480 align:middle line:84%
do not reach level
five; they will fail.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So then with every
challenge or adversity,

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:12.370 align:middle line:84%
can it be said that the
intelligence of any being,

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:16.210 align:middle line:84%
or collective being, accelerates
because they are forced to be

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.990 align:middle line:90%
creative and adapt?

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of cosmic
evolution, the cheating process,

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:29.190 align:middle line:84%
which means to find a more
clever solution to some things,

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.280 align:middle line:84%
it's like a creative
approach to something,

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:38.910 align:middle line:84%
that could also rule out
something that became obsolete,

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:44.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a very
traditional rule set

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and you find a better way
to do it, then why not?

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.300 align:middle line:10%
It's more effective.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So if we're coming back to
this warrior type species

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.980 align:middle line:84%
that we were talking about
in the previous episode,

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.130 align:middle line:84%
when you then apply the
law of the first order,

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.840 align:middle line:84%
that means to bring all these
potentially self-destructive

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.910 align:middle line:84%
warrior species
together and to use them

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:15.030 align:middle line:84%
in a useful way for the overall
evolution of the universe.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And that means to have
moderation and reasonability.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>> How do these laws
influence us on Earth today?

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>> From a mainstream
understanding of law,

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.250 align:middle line:84%
people only know the
so-called domestic law,

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.490 align:middle line:84%
which means those are the
regulations that we have

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:38.370 align:middle line:84%
in countries or in regions and
cities, and also in tribes,

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.740 align:middle line:10%
What we miss out, and
this comes into play when

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.450 align:middle line:10%
we take the exo-political
factor into it,

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:55.110 align:middle line:10%
is the so-called genetic
law and the temporal law,

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:59.490 align:middle line:10%
and in the last instance,
the law of the first order.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:05.010 align:middle line:10%
Genetic law means that
those who have their stocks

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:12.180 align:middle line:10%
into the genetics of a species
also have a kind of authority

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:10%
to what the rules and what
the destiny of the species

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.470 align:middle line:10%
is, which makes sense.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So, basically, a species
that is very pure in genetics

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:28.060 align:middle line:84%
can rule out everything
on their own.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:33.010 align:middle line:84%
As we know on Earth, we
have like 12 manipulators

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:37.480 align:middle line:84%
of the genetics and some
of them did that in order

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.300 align:middle line:84%
to have some influence
on the regulations

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and of the destiny
of this planet.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And that makes things a
little more complicated.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:50.260 align:middle line:84%
The third factor is the
so-called temporal law.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:55.660 align:middle line:84%
In domestic law, we know that if
you have a basic first instance

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.510 align:middle line:84%
of law, when you're not
happy with the decision

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.390 align:middle line:84%
that a judge made, you can
go to the next instance

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and he will rule
maybe differently.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:08.500 align:middle line:84%
We have the same steps
coming from domestic law,

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:14.280 align:middle line:84%
to genetic law, to temporal law,
to the law of the first order.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.060 align:middle line:84%
As we already
approached that topic,

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.540 align:middle line:84%
the Greys are coming
from a previous version

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.050 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So their understanding is that
they are here the longest time.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:31.980 align:middle line:90%
Because there are some species--

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.430 align:middle line:84%
and that has happened in
the history of Earth--

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.190 align:middle line:90%
that are time-traveling species.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen that with at
least one reptilian species

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:84%
that has changed the
timelines of Earth.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And they say that they have more
authoritarian power on Earth

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.530 align:middle line:90%
because they went through time.

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:58.720 align:middle line:84%
They influenced humanity
almost from the beginning on.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.900 align:middle line:84%
But that is why
when the Greys say

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.180 align:middle line:84%
that they come from a previous
version of the universe,

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:10.630 align:middle line:84%
and so their authoritarian
power is the greatest of all.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, what or who maintains
and oversees these laws?

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, so while cosmic
laws are a natural force

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and describes the natural
dynamics of the universe,

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:84%
all other laws we're talking
about are artificial laws,

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.970 align:middle line:90%
which are set upon something.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.280 align:middle line:84%
The Greys, for
example, they gave

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.030 align:middle line:84%
technology and other
things to species

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.670 align:middle line:84%
and to planetary
systems in order

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:44.980 align:middle line:84%
to offer their help as
an administrative force.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.590 align:middle line:10%
When we're talking about
the law of the first order,

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:49.780 align:middle line:10%
this is something
that does not apply

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:10%
to every part of the
universe, although this

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.660 align:middle line:10%
is the mission of the
Greys to establish that.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:84%
But it only applies to those who
are in contract with the Greys.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So local laws, the lowest
threshold to the set of laws

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.910 align:middle line:84%
we're talking
about, and the Greys

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:15.260 align:middle line:84%
understand themselves as some
kind of supervision instance.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So they oversee and
regulate for those planets

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:26.980 align:middle line:84%
in the last instance when
the law of the first order

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.760 align:middle line:90%
applies to the star system.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>> The Greys must be hundreds of
thousands of years ahead of us.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Why is this level
fun for the Greys?

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>> We were talking
about this master line,

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:84%
which means that the Greys
became very isolated in one

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:46.380 align:middle line:84%
previous version of the
universe and through that,

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:51.300 align:middle line:84%
experienced lots of trauma, and
they needed to shut that down,

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and they needed some kind
of reason to be alive.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:16:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And the lowest reason
that is stable enough

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:07.500 align:middle line:84%
to ascend to level seven
is the emotion of fun.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>> The Greys are
overseeing laws,

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.380 align:middle line:84%
but if I or any civilization do
not want to play by their rules

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.560 align:middle line:84%
anymore, who's going
to enforce those rules?

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It depends on how much
you influence the evolution

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.070 align:middle line:90%
of others.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.990 align:middle line:84%
If a species decides
for themselves

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:28.810 align:middle line:84%
to be self-destructive
and to carry that out,

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.650 align:middle line:90%
then it's OK for the Greys.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:35.610 align:middle line:84%
Because they will eventually
be a failed timeline.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:38.430 align:middle line:90%
They will vanish and fade away.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:42.780 align:middle line:84%
But and there are some
species that do that in order

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:47.130 align:middle line:84%
to be as stable as possible
and as long as possible

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:84%
without changing, they try
to subjugate other species.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
the Greys step in

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.200 align:middle line:84%
in order to preserve
the tonal dynamic

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.349 align:middle line:84%
and the overall evolution
of the universe.

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And they have various
techniques to do so.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle line:84%
For example, they could
give an ultimatum.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:84%
They also are collecting all
these Warrior type species

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:84%
to have them under
one administration,

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:34.620 align:middle line:84%
in order to have a very powerful
warrior federation or alliance,

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
in order to protect certain
parts of the universe,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and to protect the evolution and
the proceeding of the universe.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.280 align:middle line:84%
But for example, if
one species, and we

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:54.540 align:middle line:84%
do have that case unfortunately,
if we have a species that

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.090 align:middle line:84%
doesn't want to
stick to the rules,

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and is also hindering
the evolution

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual path and
forthcoming of another species,

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:15.100 align:middle line:84%
then they could easily, for
example, freeze that species.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Which means the whole
collective consciousness

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.560 align:middle line:84%
goes to a very raw
state of the universe

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.540 align:middle line:84%
and gets another chance
to play out probabilities.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And maybe take a different
step, and so not play out

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.490 align:middle line:90%
this self-destructive behavior.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.780 align:middle line:84%
If they do that,
they will end up

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.830 align:middle line:84%
at the same point they were
in the previous version,

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:43.730 align:middle line:84%
and they can do that again,
and again, and again.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:49.020 align:middle line:84%
But they also could set
up a different scenario,

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.500 align:middle line:84%
a different version
of the universe

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.280 align:middle line:84%
in order to make a
different experience happen

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.480 align:middle line:84%
for a species that has
self-destructive behavior.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Reptilian beings claim
seniority and time travel

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.000 align:middle line:90%
ability just as the Greys do.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.400 align:middle line:84%
When they both come into
power struggles, who

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.130 align:middle line:84%
physically administers
law and order

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.750 align:middle line:90%
and polices the situation?

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's the master line
of the Greys that takes

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:23.550 align:middle line:84%
the decision, but it's also the
collective of warrior species

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.490 align:middle line:84%
that will eventually
go for war then.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And if the war is not bringing
force to the ultimatum

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.680 align:middle line:84%
that the Greys give
the species, then

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.830 align:middle line:84%
eventually they will
step in, and for example,

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:46.250 align:middle line:84%
freeze or make that
species vanish.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, you use
the word, freeze.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.340 align:middle line:90%
What other word could you use?

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So we were talking about
the credo of the Greys,

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.030 align:middle line:84%
which is to serve,
protect, and synthesize.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:20:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And synthesize means to
extract something from a system

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.900 align:middle line:90%
and to put it somewhere else.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that the Greys would then

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:10.490 align:middle line:84%
do to extract, for example,
the reptilian species

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:12.990 align:middle line:84%
from this version
of the universe,

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.610 align:middle line:84%
so that this universe
can flourish.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And then put them into a very
raw version of the universe,

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:27.620 align:middle line:84%
where they can eventually
maybe develop differently.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, some people suggest
from their own ET contact

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.330 align:middle line:84%
experiences that Earth is
almost like an isolated planet,

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:39.260 align:middle line:84%
because of similar qualities
to what you just mentioned.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.210 align:middle line:90%
Is there any truth to that?

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And have the people
from Earth disobeyed

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:47.120 align:middle line:90%
the laws of the universe?

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>> There is truth to that
because when we are talking

00:20:52.040 --> 00:21:00.390 align:middle line:84%
about the first ways
humans were behaving,

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just quoting those
extraterrestrials here.

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that they say.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.840 align:middle line:84%
It's more the being six, because
they have a higher perspective

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.390 align:middle line:84%
on what has happened,
and the Greys

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:20.310 align:middle line:84%
got too much involved in the
karmic processes of the planet.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:25.260 align:middle line:84%
But when it's true what
those extraterrestrials say,

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:32.500 align:middle line:84%
then Earth man was never
planned as a caveman,

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.750 align:middle line:90%
but they were made to this.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And the way this artificial
system, the social system

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:46.900 align:middle line:84%
we find here on this
Earth has played out,

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.860 align:middle line:84%
it means that every
individual consciousness

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.620 align:middle line:84%
unit on this Earth
has challenges

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.530 align:middle line:84%
to get through that
to come to a point.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Because we have a
lot of fear involved,

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.960 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot of guilt
involved, and a lot

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:08.250 align:middle line:84%
of instances that
are telling people

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:12.810 align:middle line:90%
that there is a punishing God.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:16.380 align:middle line:84%
That if they don't behave
in some way or another

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.580 align:middle line:90%
they make them feel bad.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And also the way
death, for example,

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:28.260 align:middle line:84%
is looked upon on this
planet as something

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:35.460 align:middle line:84%
that is totally opposite to
what, for example, being six

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.627 align:middle line:90%
would say to this topic.

00:22:37.627 --> 00:22:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Are we currently
in that locked up,

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:42.930 align:middle line:84%
isolated position or
is that opening up?

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>> It's totally opening up.

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is the reason why
we have all these disclosures

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.390 align:middle line:84%
right now, because
time is running up.

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:56.100 align:middle line:84%
They are pushing a
lot to the disclosure

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.290 align:middle line:90%
topic and to get that out.

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Because the denser the universe
gets, the more influences

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:90%
are upon one point of existence.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And that will happen and
reality will shift a lot.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that these
laws of the universe are

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.170 align:middle line:84%
written into our
DNA in some way?

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Some parameters
are inside of the DNA.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
level of aggression

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:30.860 align:middle line:84%
of a species, the level of
comfort is inside of the DNA.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And the level, for example,
of peaceful behavior

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.770 align:middle line:90%
is also inside of that.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Because we know there are dozens
of manipulators on this species

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:45.650 align:middle line:84%
and the genetics of
humans on this planet,

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.410 align:middle line:84%
we can see that
the parameters that

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:53.450 align:middle line:84%
are inside of the DNA of
humans are influenced.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And all these parameters are
affecting the co-habiting

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.980 align:middle line:84%
of a subject and of
subjects in general.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Do we know the source of that
written code giving us those

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:04.640 align:middle line:90%
parameters?

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I know that it's
about 12 species,

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.580 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know all of them.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Are these master species
influencing certain parameters?

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's part of the
agenda to go to certain places

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:24.770 align:middle line:84%
and to manipulate things,
some in a benevolent way,

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:28.820 align:middle line:90%
some do it with bad agendas.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Where do you see these laws
taking humankind as we look

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:33.530 align:middle line:90%
to the future?

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>> To my understanding right now
there's an effort being taken

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:46.970 align:middle line:84%
to remove some harmful aspects
of the genetics in great parts

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:50.090 align:middle line:90%
of the population of humanity.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And we will also talk about
the installation that blocks

00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:01.770 align:middle line:90%
the evolution of humanity.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think that those
will be beneficial efforts

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:14.520 align:middle line:84%
and bring some kind of
divinity to the human

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and some elevated consciousness
to the population of Earth.

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And we will also see
that when we realize

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:26.850 align:middle line:84%
that the universe gets denser
and we will be in contact

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:30.390 align:middle line:84%
with different
forms of life, then

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:84%
we'll have to find
some kind of agreement

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.590 align:middle line:84%
in order to get
along peacefully.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And although you can see
that some species are trying

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:49.810 align:middle line:84%
to find a cohesive
regulation system in order

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:59.270 align:middle line:84%
to prevent conflicts to be part
of the universe, in the end,

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.210 align:middle line:90%
it's a lot of chaos out there.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we'll have to
deal with that for some time

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:11.110 align:middle line:84%
until mostly
everyone has realized

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:16.800 align:middle line:84%
that we are all connected and
we need to cooperate peacefully.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, is this something
we will experience

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:21.120 align:middle line:90%
in our lifetime?

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>> As I know that everyone
is responsible for their own

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:30.720 align:middle line:84%
timeline and everyone can
move and project something out

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:84%
into the field of
probabilities, yes,

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:44.190 align:middle line:84%
some will experience very
interesting changes to the way

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.950 align:middle line:90%
we structure our reality now.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, thank you so much
for being on the show.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.260 align:middle line:90%
It's always a pleasure.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much, Emery.

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith and this
is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:55.350 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.210 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Next on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I think people see Roswell
as just one crash site,

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:06.052 align:middle line:84%
one species of
beings and that's it.

00:27:06.052 --> 00:27:07.260 align:middle line:90%
What could you share with us?

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>> There were two EBEN craft's
flying over New Mexico in July

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:13.440 align:middle line:90%
in 1947.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.970 align:middle line:84%
A very violent electrical
storm and the two crafts

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.950 align:middle line:90%
collided in midair.

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:27.050 align:middle line:84%
One live ET was found, that was
EBE 1 and there was five dead.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:36.000 align:middle line:90%
