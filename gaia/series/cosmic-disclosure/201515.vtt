00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with Dr. Robert Wood,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.545 align:middle line:10%
retired aerospace engineer who
has worked on everything from

00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:29.320 align:middle line:10%
ballistic missile defense
to the Space Station.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.080 align:middle line:10%
More recently, Bob is
the editor of a new book

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.610 align:middle line:10%
on William Tompkins called
"Selected by Extraterrestrials,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:10%
Volume 2, My Life in the
Top Secret World of UFOs,

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:10%
Think Tanks, and
Nordic Secretaries."

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.420 align:middle line:90%
Bob, welcome to the show.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the
secret space program?

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.890 align:middle line:90%
I know it's very controversial.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.533 align:middle line:84%
I get these questions
all the time,

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:51.950 align:middle line:84%
especially when
people have shared

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.330 align:middle line:84%
being away on a 20-year tour
of duty to another planet.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when Bill Tompkins
first called me up and told me

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.510 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to talk about
a secret space program,

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I didn't believe him until
he convinced me that he knew

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.520 align:middle line:84%
the same people and
he was credible.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So after I got to
understand him,

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.950 align:middle line:84%
realized that he was involved
in the first part of what

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I think is now a broad
secret space program.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.050 align:middle line:10%
The part that he
was involved in was

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.360 align:middle line:10%
one for the Navy, where he was a
draftsman and a very smart one,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.940 align:middle line:10%
and a very capable
person who was

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:35.910 align:middle line:10%
being asked to draft the
designs of the Navy program

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.690 align:middle line:10%
that is now in effect.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So what was the
program called?

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It wasn't called that at that
time, but it was Solar Warden.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:10%
And basically, he
did the designs

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.430 align:middle line:10%
under the supervision
of a brand new guy

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.270 align:middle line:10%
from the Navy whose name
was Bobby Ray Inman who

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.750 align:middle line:10%
helped him design this program
that later, in the '80s,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.050 align:middle line:10%
got built as Solar Warden.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.660 align:middle line:10%
It included a cylindrical, large
spacecraft kilometers long.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>> We have a lot of people
who have come on "Cosmic

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Disclosure" and claimed to
have been on these 20 and back

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.620 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.953 align:middle line:84%
How does Bill Tompkins
describe these programs?

00:02:18.953 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, Bill got me excited
when he started talking about

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.830 align:middle line:10%
the many TRW programs that he
was involved in, 1969 to '71.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of those had to do
with time and age regression.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people in the Navy were
able to have this opportunity

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.840 align:middle line:84%
starting, I think, in about
the mid-'80s or so to elect

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.060 align:middle line:84%
an option to go to this
program where they would be not

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth and could
work for 20 years.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end, they could
either decide to continue on

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.940 align:middle line:84%
or they would be able to give
them the pill or some process

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.010 align:middle line:84%
where they go back
to their original age

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.900 align:middle line:84%
at the original
time when they left.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.230 align:middle line:84%
So this was what he described
as the 20 and back program.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about it was
that after he had described

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.780 align:middle line:84%
this in some detail,
it turned out

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.020 align:middle line:84%
that there were two or three
people who came out publicly.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.020 align:middle line:84%
He was absolutely amazed
that what he'd already

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.650 align:middle line:84%
knew was actually
true, to find out

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.600 align:middle line:84%
it was a real person
that he could talk to.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>> We have some interviews
done with William Tompkins.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.480 align:middle line:84%
The clip is about
a 20-year tour.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a look.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Thousands-- thousands,
not just a few--

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:10%
thousands of people have
joined the Navy here

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.020 align:middle line:10%
in the United States.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:90%
They joined the space Navy.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.990 align:middle line:84%
They signed up for
a 20-year tour.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.630 align:middle line:84%
So these folks,
men and women, were

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.330 align:middle line:84%
given a lot of examinations
and a lot of information

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.890 align:middle line:90%
on what they were going to need.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.630 align:middle line:90%
Many of them went to the moon--

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.950 align:middle line:84%
our moon-- the facilities
there, and got checked out,

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.530 align:middle line:84%
and organized, and
establish where

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.430 align:middle line:84%
is the best place they're going
to go, what their criteria is

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:84%
going to be, what major area
are they going to develop,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.450 align:middle line:84%
like what class in
university, and then they

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.400 align:middle line:84%
get sent to a Mars
facility for a short time.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And some of them get
to Jupiter's moons,

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.320 align:middle line:84%
where we have a large
facility on the moon.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And then they get assigned
to a specific base.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And they work for a
short time in the base

00:04:51.800 --> 00:05:01.720 align:middle line:84%
before they're assigned a Naval
cruiser, or a Naval attack

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.410 align:middle line:84%
vehicle, or even
a Naval spacecraft

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:84%
carrier, which are 1, 2,
and 4-kilometer-long class.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And we have eight of
those battle groups

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.390 align:middle line:84%
out there, so there's plenty
of room for new people

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.130 align:middle line:90%
to come aboard.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And so they do
their tour, then--

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.440 align:middle line:84%
most of it-- on the
spacecraft carriers

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.410 align:middle line:90%
or the supporting ships.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
are supply ships--

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:37.120 align:middle line:84%
not as much fun, but we
need people on them, too.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.420 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of
the 20 years, they

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.850 align:middle line:84%
have an option for
another 20 years.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:84%
They could go for
another 20 years.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Or they have the option
to come back to Earth,

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.230 align:middle line:84%
where they were born and
where they entered the Navy,

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and then they make this
decision they want to come back.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.330 align:middle line:90%
So they age regress.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.790 align:middle line:84%
They're now 20 years
older than when

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:90%
they joined the space Navy.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And so they take several
weeks or several months

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and they reverse
their age back to 21

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.520 align:middle line:90%
when they joined the Navy.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.680 align:middle line:84%
They finished their
Navy 20-year tour

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and they make the selection
to go back to United States.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, during
that 20 years,

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.600 align:middle line:84%
they had no contact with
their family or with anybody

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.860 align:middle line:90%
back on Earth.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.860 align:middle line:90%
That's a prerequisite, OK?

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.820 align:middle line:84%
So, but they remember
their family.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.080 align:middle line:84%
They remember their friends, and
the people they used to go to,

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and some of the girlfriends
they used to have.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And so they come back, but
they were 20 years older

00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:84%
when they left the planet,
so the girlfriends are

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.510 align:middle line:90%
going to be a whole lot older.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And so the Navy has allowed
them, in the Solar Warden

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.210 align:middle line:84%
system program, to
go back to the age

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.040 align:middle line:84%
that they were when
they signed up.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, you said they
were 20 years old when

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:22.320 align:middle line:84%
they signed up, so and they
went a 20-year Navy tour.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.380 align:middle line:84%
They came back and now
they're 20 years older.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And they are in
a situation where

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:34.620 align:middle line:84%
life is this 20-year-old
life that they

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.800 align:middle line:90%
had going when they left.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:47.795 align:middle line:84%
And now during that several
weeks returning, their minds--

00:07:47.795 --> 00:07:50.350 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.840 align:middle line:84%
not painfully, but
their minds are

00:07:52.840 --> 00:08:01.120 align:middle line:84%
played with to where 90.99 of
their memory for the last 20

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:90%
years out in space is removed.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.270 align:middle line:90%
So they're sitting there now.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.830 align:middle line:84%
The girlfriend is the
same age as she was.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:16.630 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.410 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't 20 years
older, like we said.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.650 align:middle line:90%
She's still the same age.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.040 align:middle line:84%
If he was married, his wife,
the kids were the same age.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.640 align:middle line:84%
They didn't spend
20 years more life.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
a cruel system.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that system is
operating, and has

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.530 align:middle line:90%
been operating, since 1980.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>> So what are they suggesting?

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.240 align:middle line:84%
That this is a type
of time travel?

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it seems to me his
explanation is the equivalent

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:55.160 align:middle line:84%
of time travel
because in principle,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.960 align:middle line:90%
if he remembered everything--

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.660 align:middle line:90%
although they try to erase it--

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.050 align:middle line:84%
he would be able to remember
two simultaneous lives,

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:84%
one was his girlfriend,
and wife, and growing up,

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and the other out
in the spacecraft.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, while he's gone
for 20 years, the soldier--

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:16.220 align:middle line:84%
and of course, 20 years on
Earth is continuing to go on--

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.050 align:middle line:84%
are they aware of
what's going on

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.765 align:middle line:90%
on Earth during that 20 years?

00:09:19.765 --> 00:09:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I know they can't communicate
with their loved ones

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.150 align:middle line:90%
as part of the contract.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I can't remember a
specific quote from Bill,

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:31.340 align:middle line:84%
but my recollection is that
the 20 and back people were not

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.010 align:middle line:90%
given the real-time facts.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.290 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
had this job which

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.400 align:middle line:84%
involves being on a spacecraft
shuttling supplies, or mining

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.130 align:middle line:84%
rocks, or something like
that, but they were never

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:84%
told what was going on on
Earth at the same time.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So they were absolutely
unknowledgeable

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:84%
about even the
politics of Earth.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the impression
he gave me,

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.390 align:middle line:84%
is that knowledge of what
was going on on Earth

00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:00.170 align:middle line:84%
was an absolute no-no, and they
did not tell any of these 20

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.810 align:middle line:90%
and back people that history.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:09.130 align:middle line:10%
>> And how many people do you
know like this that has been

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.510 align:middle line:10%
through this?

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's one of the
things that Bill impressed me

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.390 align:middle line:90%
very much.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.140 align:middle line:84%
He said, there are
thousands of people who

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.920 align:middle line:90%
have joined this Navy option.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still having
trouble believing

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:25.180 align:middle line:84%
that there were thousands of
people who have had this done.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:31.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's consistent only if
the erasure process, whereby

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:36.071 align:middle line:84%
you erase the memory,
is really very good.

00:10:36.071 --> 00:10:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And Bill, I guess, used
a number like 90% or 99%.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.970 align:middle line:84%
That means it'll be
only very few people

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.690 align:middle line:84%
for whom it was not good
and who remembered the past.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And I only know
of three for sure.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>> That's 3,000 people.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.553 align:middle line:84%
That would be hard
for those humans

00:10:56.553 --> 00:10:58.970 align:middle line:84%
to keep that kind of secret,
if you know what I mean, just

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.140 align:middle line:90%
in a numbers fashion.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It is hard to believe that
3,000 people would be able

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.840 align:middle line:90%
to keep that secret.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.980 align:middle line:84%
All that says is the memory
erasure process is very good.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>> It is, and that is
something I can attest to.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:17.060 align:middle line:90%
That does exist-- memory wiping.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.610 align:middle line:84%
I know many colonels,
and generals,

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and soldiers who have been
through programs, and also

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.940 align:middle line:84%
just really bad
situations in combat,

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:31.160 align:middle line:84%
where they were able to
erase that entire incident

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:84%
from their memory,
which is kind of scary,

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.740 align:middle line:90%
if you think about it.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I can mention one thing
that's current for me.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:40.730 align:middle line:90%
It's relevant.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.190 align:middle line:84%
I was recommended
recently to read

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:47.810 align:middle line:84%
a book that was a brand new
version of the Montauk Project.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And the Montauk Project released
the Philadelphia experiment

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:56.360 align:middle line:84%
and other time travel advances,
such that the bottom line is

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:02.470 align:middle line:84%
that this one guy, apparently in
the process of his normal life,

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:07.240 align:middle line:84%
wound up with a secret
badge in an area

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
where his name was on
the desk as the leader

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.010 align:middle line:90%
of this top secret group.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's a perfect
example of having

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:20.010 align:middle line:90%
two similar lives in parallel.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:21.200 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.590 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of scary, too.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.350 align:middle line:84%
What's the relationship
between the military

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.470 align:middle line:84%
or the corporate
world, and what is it

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:84%
meant by the interplanetary
conglomerate?

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The one thing
that I learned--

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.670 align:middle line:84%
especially in the
last few years,

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.960 align:middle line:84%
I think I've been able to put
it in context to what Bill said,

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.340 align:middle line:84%
that we had different groups
with different agendas

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.240 align:middle line:90%
and different capabilities.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And one thing became clear to me
is that the Nazis, reptilians,

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.540 align:middle line:84%
those were one group, and
they're sort of the bad ones

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:84%
because we know that
they're involved

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.350 align:middle line:84%
in slavery, and mining,
and maximizing profits.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.460 align:middle line:84%
There've been other groups
that have been mentioned,

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.480 align:middle line:84%
and Bill said, I think,
that involved, for example,

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.780 align:middle line:90%
the United Nations.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, never in
my wildest dreams

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.800 align:middle line:84%
would I have imagined that
the United Nations would have

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.460 align:middle line:84%
something that was kept
so secret that nobody knew

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.800 align:middle line:84%
about it, but apparently
that's the case,

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.400 align:middle line:84%
that there have been secret
space forces authorized

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.943 align:middle line:90%
through the UN.

00:13:28.943 --> 00:13:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And then in addition,
of course, there's

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:36.150 align:middle line:84%
the Solar Warden that the
Nordics kind of helped start.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's have a look at this
video with William about

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.930 align:middle line:84%
the interplanetary
corporate conglomerate.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>> --because of lack of
understanding and lack

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:51.890 align:middle line:84%
of acceptance of the subject
matter of extraterrestrials.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.130 align:middle line:84%
This is staggering
because it's not

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:59.300 align:middle line:84%
just many of the extremely
well-educated people

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.060 align:middle line:84%
in the country
working on this, not

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:06.350 align:middle line:84%
wanting to accept the
reality of what we were into,

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:13.790 align:middle line:84%
but they even participated in
trying to nullify the program,

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.130 align:middle line:90%
throw wrenches into the gears.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And even at Douglas,
over at TRW,

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and all of these
other companies--

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle line:84%
General Dynamics included--
there were the top-level people

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:33.110 align:middle line:84%
who were throwing
negatives on everything

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.650 align:middle line:90%
that we were attempting to do.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So you have to ask the
question, why do we have so much

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:45.460 align:middle line:84%
of this at such a high
level in technology

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.110 align:middle line:84%
in the country and
the whole military?

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And who is telling them to
try to stop everything, try

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:02.220 align:middle line:84%
to cut it down, when we're
trying to help ourselves

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and supposedly, that's
what the military's for?

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.460 align:middle line:84%
But the corporations,
at the same time

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:12.000 align:middle line:84%
they were doing the
military mission programs,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.390 align:middle line:84%
they were doing other
programs, which could possibly

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:27.250 align:middle line:84%
allow them to nullify the
space programs of the military,

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:28.990 align:middle line:90%
like Solar Warden.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And these people then utilizing
all the advances in space

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:40.880 align:middle line:84%
systems, military-wise,
developed a capability to move

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:47.740 align:middle line:84%
off the planet and mine
materials on other planets

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:54.440 align:middle line:84%
in the solar system and/or
continue on out into the galaxy

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.350 align:middle line:90%
through the 12 closest stars--

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:59.050 align:middle line:90%
Alpha Centauri being the first--

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and mining, or extracting
materials, or whatever,

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:90%
and making money.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:12.000 align:middle line:84%
This same group of top corporate
people of all these companies

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.600 align:middle line:84%
that are doing the jobs that
they're getting paid for

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:28.840 align:middle line:84%
were paralleling the space
missions for industrialization

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.950 align:middle line:90%
making money.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:33.100 align:middle line:84%
It just seems really
strange that this

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.650 align:middle line:84%
is where we would be
finding ourselves,

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:39.910 align:middle line:84%
because they're using all
of the best capabilities.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:42.830 align:middle line:90%
It's already been done for them.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:84%
We've got corporate
operations operating parallel

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:53.080 align:middle line:84%
to missions to
solar system planets

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:58.775 align:middle line:84%
and other stars' planets
doing the same thing.

00:16:58.775 --> 00:16:59.575 align:middle line:90%
The word is greed.

00:16:59.575 --> 00:17:03.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:09.192 align:middle line:84%
Whatever helps them
financially, this

00:17:09.192 --> 00:17:10.859 align:middle line:84%
is where they're going
to put the money.

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:13.829 align:middle line:84%
This is where they're going
to do all the development.

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So this interplanetary
corporate conglomerate,

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:21.123 align:middle line:84%
who controls them, and what's
the structure for that?

00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Because of course, the
civilians here on Earth

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.240 align:middle line:90%
don't know about it.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>> My impression was that Bill
was great at doing whatever

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.870 align:middle line:84%
assignment he got, but he
was never included as part

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.720 align:middle line:84%
of the overall
management structure.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:46.800 align:middle line:84%
He began at the lowest level
and when he was discharged,

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:52.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what his rank
was, but he was not an officer.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.120 align:middle line:84%
So his job, and his
roles, and his skills

00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:00.490 align:middle line:84%
resulted in his doing the
things he was asked to do

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.620 align:middle line:84%
and being exposed to
the management that

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.290 align:middle line:84%
was asking it to be
done, but he was never

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.770 align:middle line:84%
a part of the management
and would have never

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:15.350 align:middle line:84%
had the reason to ask questions
like, how does this work?

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.820 align:middle line:90%
Who's making the money?

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.830 align:middle line:90%
What's the management structure?

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:23.510 align:middle line:84%
That would've been beyond
his normal instincts.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:28.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Why is it that he was able
to speak so freely about his

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:32.780 align:middle line:10%
involvement with this to the
public and also mention names?

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things he told me
at the very beginning when he

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:40.040 align:middle line:84%
was involved in being a courier
for the reports of these

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.460 align:middle line:84%
interviews with the Navy
spies was that there were no

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.830 align:middle line:84%
classification marks
on these documents.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:49.100 align:middle line:84%
He would take this clearly
top secret material

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.350 align:middle line:84%
about what the Nazis
were doing and deliver it

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.930 align:middle line:84%
to universities and
other institutions

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.470 align:middle line:90%
without any markings.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>> And how many spies--

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:57.680 align:middle line:90%
we talked about this--

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.890 align:middle line:90%
that were involved with Germany?

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:07.880 align:middle line:84%
There were 29 Navy officers
who had German-speaking skills

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and would pass, and had
passed, as German citizens.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And these people would regularly
come back over the four years

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:22.250 align:middle line:84%
that he was there and
report to General Botta

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:90%
about what was going on.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.597 align:middle line:84%
They had a wide
variety of reports,

00:19:26.597 --> 00:19:28.430 align:middle line:84%
and that's one of things
in the second book,

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I think is so interesting, that
the actual language Bill has

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.140 align:middle line:90%
recalled in some detail.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Bill was involved
with the Apollo missions.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.130 align:middle line:84%
What could you
tell us about that?

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Bill was an important
person in ground support

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:46.910 align:middle line:84%
electronics, which was the
same kind of people who pushed

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.500 align:middle line:90%
the button.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.150 align:middle line:84%
The ground support
electronics people

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.540 align:middle line:84%
were the ones who wanted to make
sure that everything checked

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.130 align:middle line:90%
out properly.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And he had learned that the
Germans, under von Braun,

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.150 align:middle line:84%
had been checking
out the V2 rockets

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.100 align:middle line:90%
in the horizontal position.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And in our development of
the Thor rocket at Douglas

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Aircraft, you find out
a lot of things work

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:14.480 align:middle line:84%
better when they were
in the right position

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.420 align:middle line:84%
because gravity would
affect the performance.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.210 align:middle line:84%
So he went down and
gave this big pitch

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:84%
to von Braun and Dr.
Debus telling them

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:84%
that here's what I
think you ought to do.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:31.460 align:middle line:84%
For Complex 39, you ought to
plan for vertical checkout.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
way they built it.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And so his presentation
actually made a huge impact

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:43.580 align:middle line:84%
on our space program by our
moving from the von Braun

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.960 align:middle line:90%
horizontal to our vertical.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's some more from
Bill on interplanetary corporate

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:51.850 align:middle line:90%
conglomerates.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:58.966 align:middle line:84%
>> I get fired from Douglas for
going to Apollo and von Braun

00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:01.000 align:middle line:90%
and changing the program.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.340 align:middle line:10%
I get fired on the Friday.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:11.060 align:middle line:10%
And Saturday night, my secretary
calls me and tells me, OK,

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:15.590 align:middle line:10%
Billy, I've talked
to Dr. Debus and he

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:19.190 align:middle line:10%
wants you to talk
to Dr. so-and-so

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:10%
at the corporate office of
North American over at LAX.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:84%
So I call Dr. Debus and
he has made arrangement

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:35.090 align:middle line:84%
for me to take a position in
the corporate office of North

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:40.070 align:middle line:84%
American in advanced
space programs--

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:46.410 align:middle line:84%
vehicles-- and over propulsion
system programs at Rocketdyne.

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.800 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, they're the ones that
build these great big space

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.230 align:middle line:10%
shuttles, and
everybody's seen them.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:54.470 align:middle line:10%
So now I'm an advisor
to these guys.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:59.780 align:middle line:84%
I bring my stuff with me,
a lot of it, from Douglas

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:04.830 align:middle line:90%
to my offices in North American.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:15.780 align:middle line:84%
I put together a rough of a
plan how to design and build

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:21.330 align:middle line:84%
commercial spaceships,
which could go out

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:26.550 align:middle line:84%
into the solar system
and set up facilities

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.400 align:middle line:84%
on local solar system
planets to learn

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:36.480 align:middle line:84%
how to mine some particular
mineral here on the planets.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:41.550 align:middle line:84%
As a learning program to go
out into the galaxy as business

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:48.540 align:middle line:84%
and commercial and operate
from another star's planet with

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:52.440 align:middle line:84%
large corporations-- all
private, non-military--

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:59.460 align:middle line:84%
to not just go look for mining,
but virtually any subject

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.770 align:middle line:84%
we can come up
with-- commercial.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:03.900 align:middle line:90%
Interface, commercial.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.590 align:middle line:84%
But they had far more
important things to do,

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and so I didn't get involved
with developing that.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.470 align:middle line:84%
But other people
took it over later on

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.320 align:middle line:84%
and they implemented
the program.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:24.510 align:middle line:84%
2003, they had their facilities
run in two different locations,

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:29.250 align:middle line:84%
one on Mars and one
on another planet

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:34.440 align:middle line:90%
off of the second closest star.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.210 align:middle line:90%
They're mining now.

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:39.480 align:middle line:84%
They're mining and they're
commercially operating--

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:44.740 align:middle line:84%
North American company
here in Los Angeles.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.540 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Still the same company
as it was way back

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:53.250 align:middle line:84%
doing rocket engines,
and space shuttles,

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:54.700 align:middle line:90%
and all this other stuff.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:24:00.910 align:middle line:84%
So they took that concept, used
it for commercial operations,

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:04.860 align:middle line:84%
which is what we wanted
to do way back when

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.040 align:middle line:90%
we were trying to start this.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.353 align:middle line:84%
But they took the time,
they brought the people in,

00:24:09.353 --> 00:24:10.770 align:middle line:84%
and they did the
commercial stuff,

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:12.400 align:middle line:90%
and they're doing it now.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.520 align:middle line:90%
They're successfully operating.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:23.190 align:middle line:84%
What I'm trying to say is
there's maybe as many as 25,

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:28.500 align:middle line:84%
28 companies here
on this planet that

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:33.630 align:middle line:84%
are operating commercial
operations out in the galaxy.

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Is Bill talking about the
commercialization of the new

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:43.100 align:middle line:84%
corporations out there, such
as SpaceX, Virgin Galactic?

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.190 align:middle line:90%
There's a few others.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm mystified these days
as to why on Earth we would be

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:52.600 align:middle line:84%
using chemical propulsions to
talk about going anywhere when

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.300 align:middle line:84%
it's clear that we have our
capability to do it with

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.820 align:middle line:90%
gravity control devices.

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.102 align:middle line:84%
The whole reason
that's obvious is

00:25:00.102 --> 00:25:02.560 align:middle line:84%
they just don't want the public
to know about the existence

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.300 align:middle line:90%
of our secret space forces.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.260 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:12.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm mystified as to
why the government lets

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:16.630 align:middle line:90%
this happen without--

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:19.220 align:middle line:84%
well, I guess it
keeps things stable.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:21.673 align:middle line:84%
Don't you think it
has something to do

00:25:21.673 --> 00:25:27.950 align:middle line:84%
with as soon as you expose
anti-gravitic technologies,

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.230 align:middle line:84%
there goes gas, coal,
and oil out the door?

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:31.330 align:middle line:90%
We don't need it anymore.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:32.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:25:32.065 --> 00:25:32.865 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:32.865 --> 00:25:37.940 align:middle line:84%
The suppression of anything
that would affect the automobile

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:44.180 align:middle line:84%
industry has been a
constant in Bill's story.

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:48.440 align:middle line:84%
He became involved with
that firsthand at TRW,

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.570 align:middle line:84%
and it's been
consistent ever since.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:54.090 align:middle line:90%


00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:56.190 align:middle line:84%
It's not clear to
me who's running

00:25:56.190 --> 00:26:00.780 align:middle line:84%
the world, the deep
state, or somebody else,

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.700 align:middle line:84%
or the Masons, or
some combination,

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.010 align:middle line:84%
or whether they're
all interrelated.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:09.970 align:middle line:84%
But clearly, whoever it is
does not want free energy

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:15.490 align:middle line:84%
and anti-gravity
available to the public.

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's surprising to me
because of the entrepreneurship

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.575 align:middle line:90%
that Americans have usually had.

00:26:20.575 --> 00:26:22.700 align:middle line:84%
You'd think that somebody
would have figured it out

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.030 align:middle line:90%
in his garage.

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
answer is they have,

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:29.170 align:middle line:84%
and they have been told that
that's not going to happen.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:31.530 align:middle line:84%
You just get the
knock on the door,

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and they slap a National
Security Act on you,

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and they take everything
out of your lab.

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:41.270 align:middle line:84%
I can speak and
attest to this through

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:42.710 align:middle line:90%
my own personal experience.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Tesla was probably one
of the first big ones who lost

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:51.440 align:middle line:84%
it all that way, except he was
dead when they stole it all.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful experiences.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Bob, thank you so much for
coming on "Cosmic" again.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.300 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
