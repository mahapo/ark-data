00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH GOLEMBESKE: It
flew without wings.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And from the moment it
appeared, the mystery began.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.670 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>> We have an object that
presents very advanced

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.180 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.005 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: I'm a little
nervous, I'll be honest.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.740 align:middle line:84%
I feel like something
extraordinary is going on.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVEN GREER:
It's certainly real.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.020 align:middle line:90%
It's using an energy field.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.580 align:middle line:90%
A type of anti-gravity effect.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ERIC BURLISON: I think
I have a responsibility

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.227 align:middle line:90%
to investigate it.

00:00:46.227 --> 00:00:48.810 align:middle line:10%
>>JOSÉ ARIOS RESTREPO: After I
took the sphere from the place,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:10%
I looked around the area
and all the grass around it

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.120 align:middle line:10%
was dried up.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:10%


00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.580 align:middle line:10%
>>RODOLFO GARRIDO
COTHAM: The sphere

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.850 align:middle line:10%
contains cutting-edge
technology, such as fiber optics

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.797 align:middle line:10%
for space communication.

00:01:00.797 --> 00:01:02.380 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID VÉLEZ: It
only weighed 2 kilos

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.010 align:middle line:10%
when the sphere
was handed to me.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.752 align:middle line:10%
Today, it weighs 10 kilos.

00:01:05.752 --> 00:01:07.210 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID ÁVILA
ROLDÁN: When scanning

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.460 align:middle line:10%
the surface of the
sphere, the engravings

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:10%
do not appear so that
we can scan them.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:10%
>>JOSH: What does that imply?

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ROLDÁN: There is a theory
that we are working on.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Two men tried
to take the sphere.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.547 align:middle line:90%
Is that unusual?

00:01:19.547 --> 00:01:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Or is that exactly
what we should have

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.255 align:middle line:90%
expected in this situation?

00:01:22.255 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:10%
>>DANIEL SHEEHAN:
Our national security

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.470 align:middle line:10%
state people are going to be
extremely interested in this.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.828 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Is it non-human
technology or is it man-made?

00:01:28.828 --> 00:01:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIME MAUSSAN: It's
not human technology.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.970 align:middle line:90%
There is no question in my mind.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:90%
This could change our future.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.100 align:middle line:84%
For the first time ever, it's
in the hands of civilians.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.060 align:middle line:10%
>>JOSH: I'm guest
host Josh Golembeske,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:10%
and this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:84%
How can a perfectly
round, metallic sphere

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.000 align:middle line:84%
with no wings, no seams, and
no visible propulsion fly?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Witnesses in Columbia observed
the object gliding with purpose,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.060 align:middle line:84%
until it struck
high-voltage power lines

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.570 align:middle line:90%
and dropped to the ground.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.210 align:middle line:84%
What they recovered
wasn't just unusual,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.150 align:middle line:84%
it was unlike
anything we've ever

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.170 align:middle line:84%
seen-- smooth, metallic, and
etched with unknown markings

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.050 align:middle line:90%
and symbols.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.810 align:middle line:84%
The object now known
as the Buga Sphere

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.540 align:middle line:84%
has become the center
of a growing mystery.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.030 align:middle line:84%
In this special edition
of Cosmic Disclosure,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I traveled to Mexico City, where
a major press conference has

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.540 align:middle line:84%
brought this extraordinary
artifact to the world stage,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.360 align:middle line:84%
raising a single question
at the heart of it all--

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.840 align:middle line:84%
what is the Buga Sphere,
and who or what sent it?

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Danny, thank you for
being here today.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.453 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Terrific.

00:02:39.453 --> 00:02:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So you have a very long,
very celebrated legal career.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.940 align:middle line:84%
What made you
interested, or why or how

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.740 align:middle line:84%
did you get involved with the
Buga Sphere investigation?

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.100 align:middle line:10%
>>SHEEHAN: I got
called by Jaime.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.400 align:middle line:10%
Jaime called me, middle of the
night somewhere, and he said,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.330 align:middle line:10%
"Danny," he said, "look,
they've just found this sphere,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.385 align:middle line:10%
let me show you-- let me--

00:02:59.385 --> 00:03:01.260 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to send you
on the phone right now,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.540 align:middle line:10%
I want you to look at it," this
little sphere was flying all

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.155 align:middle line:10%
around this little town down
in Colombia in the-- he said,

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:10%
"I want you to look at it, and
then I'm going to call you right

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.120 align:middle line:10%
back."

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.078 align:middle line:90%
So I said, "All right."

00:03:13.078 --> 00:03:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So I go to the phone
and there it is,

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.740 align:middle line:84%
flying all around
this little town.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And then I see it
hit and go down,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.450 align:middle line:84%
it hit this high-tension
wire and it went down,

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and then they showed the guy
run and pick it up, and I said,

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.970 align:middle line:90%
"Wow, this are great footage."

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.053 align:middle line:84%
And he calls me back and
he said, "Look," he said,

00:03:29.053 --> 00:03:30.720 align:middle line:84%
"I'm going to go
get this thing."

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, "They called me,
and I'm going to go get it."

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.217 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Good, get it."

00:03:35.217 --> 00:03:37.550 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Now look," I said,
"be really careful now about

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.388 align:middle line:84%
maintaining the chain
of custody on this.

00:03:39.388 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:84%
You've got the video of the guy
actually going and picking it

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.370 align:middle line:90%
up, you know who that guy is.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Find out from him who else has
had this in their possession,

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.090 align:middle line:84%
because we have to maintain
the chain of custody on this,"

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.560 align:middle line:90%
just like in a legal case.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And you want to involve directly
the University of Mexico.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.180 align:middle line:84%
You want to have a
university facility be

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.820 align:middle line:84%
part of the coalition
that's working on this,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:90%
is the juridical entity.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Will you help
put that together for us?"

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.350 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "OK, I'll do that."

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And what you're going to do is
set up a-- like what would be

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.850 align:middle line:84%
a United States 501(c)(3)
public interest organization.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's going to
be invested in it,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.105 align:middle line:84%
nobody's going to
make any money on it.

00:04:17.105 --> 00:04:18.390 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely clear.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.630 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be a completely
non-profit-making operation.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's going to try to
get hold of the technology

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.910 align:middle line:84%
or develop it or
make money on it,

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.618 align:middle line:84%
and it's all going
to be open source.

00:04:27.618 --> 00:04:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Then he called me
and he said, "Look,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.600 align:middle line:90%
I need you to come down here.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
going to do is we're

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.120 align:middle line:84%
going to have a press
conference down here.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.820 align:middle line:84%
We're going to organize this,
we're going to have a big press

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.190 align:middle line:90%
conference."

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.170 align:middle line:84%
He says, "Will you come
down and be there?"

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.940 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Jaime,
anything you want."

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.350 align:middle line:10%
>>JOSH: On June 20, 2025,
acclaimed investigative

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:10%
journalist Jaime Maussan
convened a major press

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.510 align:middle line:10%
conference in Mexico
City to present

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:10%
initial scientific findings
surrounding the object now known

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.900 align:middle line:10%
as the Buga Sphere, a mysterious
flying sphere recovered

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.080 align:middle line:10%
in the town of Buga, Colombia.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.380 align:middle line:84%
The event drew notable guests,
including US Congressman Eric

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Burlison, disclosure
advocate Dr. Steven

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Greer, and constitutional
attorney Daniel Sheehan,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.810 align:middle line:84%
each adding their own
voice to the growing

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.200 align:middle line:84%
call for a deeper investigation
into the sphere's origin

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.730 align:middle line:90%
and purpose.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I would like to
introduce to you our friend.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.952 align:middle line:10%
This is the Buga Sphere.

00:05:20.952 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a sphere that is in
the hands of civil society

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.660 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.020 align:middle line:84%
It was filmed while it was
levitating over the City of Buga

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.660 align:middle line:90%
in Colombia, very close to Cali.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.670 align:middle line:10%
And that fortunately, the people
who were filming this sphere

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:50.000 align:middle line:10%
saw it descend just
a few feet away.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And they were able
to recover it.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a sphere that has
been tested preliminarily

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:90%
in Mexico by scientists.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.960 align:middle line:90%
I am very excited.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.630 align:middle line:10%
I am very proud to come
to this point in my career

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:11.270 align:middle line:10%
where finally I can
exhibit an anomalous object

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.650 align:middle line:10%
in my own perspective
as a non-human device.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.080 align:middle line:10%
And if we can prove
this scientifically,

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.760 align:middle line:10%
we've taken a larger
step for the acceptance

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.650 align:middle line:10%
that we are not alone
in this universe,

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.300 align:middle line:10%
that we are being
visited, and that we

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.310 align:middle line:10%
are many of different societies,
civilizations that exist out

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.910 align:middle line:10%
there in the universe.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:40.276 align:middle line:84%
I think the time is now
to accept this reality.

00:06:40.276 --> 00:06:43.542 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:43.542 --> 00:06:46.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Much of what we know
now about the Buga Sphere

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.540 align:middle line:84%
began with José Restrepo, a
resident of Buga, Colombia.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.540 align:middle line:84%
He was the first to
encounter the object

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.210 align:middle line:84%
after it fell, recovering
it from the ground

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.080 align:middle line:84%
and bringing it into
public awareness,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.043 align:middle line:84%
setting the
investigation in motion.

00:07:03.043 --> 00:07:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSÉ ARIOS RESTREPO:
Good morning, everyone.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.430 align:middle line:10%
Thank you very much
for this invitation.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:middle line:10%
My name is José Restrepo.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.340 align:middle line:10%
I'm the person who
found the sphere.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.680 align:middle line:10%
So the video is authentic.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Of course it's
authentic, and you

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.800 align:middle line:90%
can see it with the close-up.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.490 align:middle line:84%
When it was right next to it,
the sphere started humming,

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.710 align:middle line:84%
and that's when I turned
around and looked at it,

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.690 align:middle line:84%
and that's when I
started filming.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.560 align:middle line:84%
You have high-voltage
lines nearby.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.540 align:middle line:84%
The sphere got too
close to the lines.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.203 align:middle line:84%
These high-voltage lines
transmit electricity at 10,000

00:07:38.203 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:90%
volts.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:44.090 align:middle line:84%
There's a small spark, and I
saw how it impacted the sphere.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.230 align:middle line:90%
I listened to the short circuit.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.310 align:middle line:84%
I was getting ready
to go, and when

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.230 align:middle line:84%
I realized all the
grass was dried up,

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.370 align:middle line:84%
it was sitting on the
grass for 15 minutes

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.950 align:middle line:90%
and it dehydrated the grass.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:03.870 align:middle line:84%
When I got hold of it,
it was so impressive

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.180 align:middle line:84%
that I did get a
little bit scared,

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.270 align:middle line:90%
but I also felt internal peace.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.610 align:middle line:90%
A signal which is peaceful.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.460 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.260 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: I also had
the opportunity

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.280 align:middle line:84%
to sit down with José Restrepo
for a one-on-one interview.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.720 align:middle line:84%
In this conversation, he shared
personal reflections and details

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.910 align:middle line:84%
not covered in the
press conference.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:30.610 align:middle line:84%
José, you're the guy
who found the sphere.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.966 align:middle line:84%
That must have been
an incredible moment.

00:08:33.966 --> 00:08:36.299 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSÉ ARIOS RESTREPO: It
fell into a very steep ravine.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.720 align:middle line:10%
When I first got it,
it weighed 2 kilos.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.070 align:middle line:84%
When I first picked it
up, I just look at it,

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.440 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
what's inside of it.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And I take this sphere and
I place it in a safe space

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.450 align:middle line:84%
while I get the gear to
actually move it around.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Funny enough, after I took
the sphere from the place,

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.900 align:middle line:84%
I looked around the area,
and all the grass around it

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.220 align:middle line:90%
was dried up.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.292 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Did you have any effects
after you held the sphere,

00:09:00.292 --> 00:09:01.250 align:middle line:90%
after you gave it away?

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Did you go through
anything else in your body,

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.650 align:middle line:90%
emotionally or physically?

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSÉ ARIOS RESTREPO:
I lost my fingerprints.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.920 align:middle line:90%
My mouth tasted like aluminum.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.860 align:middle line:90%
I had nausea.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Headaches.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.170 align:middle line:90%
And dizziness.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.900 align:middle line:84%
But it was only two days
with those symptoms.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: What do you believe,
in your heart of hearts,

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.410 align:middle line:90%
what the sphere was or is?

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSÉ ARIOS RESTREPO:
Something wonderful.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.400 align:middle line:90%
And I'm happy with it.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.210 align:middle line:90%
And it gives me peace.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: After keeping the
sphere for a couple of days,

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:84%
José passed it to his cousin,
David Vélez, an engineer

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.830 align:middle line:84%
with an electronics
lab in Colombia.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Intrigued by the object's
unusual properties,

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.620 align:middle line:84%
David began running
preliminary tests.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.070 align:middle line:84%
What he found raised
even more questions

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and quickly drew attention from
far beyond his local community.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID VÉLEZ: Good afternoon.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.450 align:middle line:10%
The person who found
the sphere is José.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.010 align:middle line:10%
He's my first cousin.

00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:02.460 align:middle line:10%
I have a small electronic lab,
and we did electronic tests

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:07.810 align:middle line:10%
on it, and it did
emanate a frequency, 125,

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.490 align:middle line:10%
and it did represent an antenna
that transmitted signals

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:17.890 align:middle line:10%
like a radio, which varied from
80, to 120, to 75, back to 80.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a different
type of communication

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.470 align:middle line:84%
that isn't seen in
our radio waves.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.920 align:middle line:84%
What was also incredible
regarding this sphere

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:84%
is that when it was
delivered to me by José,

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.660 align:middle line:90%
it only weighed 2 kilograms.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.970 align:middle line:90%
I weigh it once again.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:84%
When I put it on the scale,
it didn't weigh 2 kilograms

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.990 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:42.270 align:middle line:84%
The weight had increased
to 6.65 kilograms.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:90%
This is incredible.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.820 align:middle line:84%
I was truly impressed
because the sphere

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.290 align:middle line:90%
was increasing in weight.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.870 align:middle line:10%
It had no cables,
no electronics,

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.090 align:middle line:10%
nothing that we could analyze.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.640 align:middle line:10%
It's a high-density aluminum.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.210 align:middle line:90%
This was absolutely eccentric.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.940 align:middle line:10%
We knew this was a
non-human artifact,

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:10%
and that's where
we started being

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:09.360 align:middle line:10%
contacted by UFO researchers and
journalists to offer us money.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to
make this public.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.680 align:middle line:10%
They tried to bribe me
directly from Spain, two

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.120 align:middle line:10%
or three different
organizations,

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:24.380 align:middle line:10%
NGO companies which I will
not say their name because it

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.590 align:middle line:10%
would be negative.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.220 align:middle line:10%
And they offered me a great
amount of money for the sphere.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:33.230 align:middle line:10%
I said, "It's not
for sale, period."

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.520 align:middle line:10%
And that's how I answered
each of those petitions.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.880 align:middle line:10%
And Maussan says you're
acting ethically.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.960 align:middle line:10%
When they started
threatening me, literally,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.560 align:middle line:10%
they called me up and said, "If
you don't deliver the sphere,

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.110 align:middle line:10%
such and such is going
to happen to you."

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:55.030 align:middle line:10%
I have an audio that I recorded
where somebody was threatening

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.150 align:middle line:10%
me during eight
minutes saying that "We

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.200 align:middle line:10%
are the owners of this sphere.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle line:84%
It's our artifact, we
reverse-engineered it.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And what we are able
to do is levitate it,

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:14.120 align:middle line:84%
and it flew 350 meters away
from our territory, it's ours.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.170 align:middle line:90%
Please give it back."

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.240 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was spying on me.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:10%
Actually, it was
very crazy because I

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:25.610 align:middle line:10%
felt threatened by different
people from different countries.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.860 align:middle line:10%
One person would say
that this is fake.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.230 align:middle line:10%
Another person would
say that this is theirs.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.050 align:middle line:10%
We knew this was a
non-human artifact.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:34.520 align:middle line:90%
We need to investigate it.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And with respect, I gave
the sphere to Jaime Maussan

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.500 align:middle line:90%
for further study.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.210 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Mr. Maussan.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.010 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So you seem like
you were the right guy

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.590 align:middle line:90%
to get handed this sphere.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:51.820 align:middle line:90%
So walk me through this.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Your cousin finds the sphere,
and he gives it to you.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:84%
You are in possession
for two months.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:84%
What was the most fascinating
or interesting thing

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.988 align:middle line:84%
you learned or that happened
to you during those two months?

00:13:02.988 --> 00:13:05.280 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID VÉLEZ: The most
shocking thing about the sphere

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.020 align:middle line:10%
was its weight.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.450 align:middle line:84%
It only weighed 2 kilos when
the sphere was handed to me.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:84%
15 days later, it
went up to 6 kilos.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Later, it grew all
the way to 9 kilos.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.120 align:middle line:90%
And today, it weighs 10 kilos.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: How do you explain that?

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID VÉLEZ: It lost its
anti-gravitational system.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.280 align:middle line:84%
This system was
thrown into a wreck

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.700 align:middle line:84%
after it got shocked by
the high-voltage cables

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.110 align:middle line:90%
that it crashed into.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.360 align:middle line:84%
The place where it
landed, it dried up

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:84%
every single bit of
grass where it crashed,

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.650 align:middle line:90%
and the grass never grew back.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:41.030 align:middle line:84%
The sphere went into
quarantine to avoid any risks

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.750 align:middle line:90%
with the workers of the company.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.440 align:middle line:84%
After quarantine, we
removed our lead suits

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and we were able to handle
the sphere as regular people.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.940 align:middle line:90%
That's when we got scared.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:84%
After we poured water into
it, the water evaporated.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's documented.

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.610 align:middle line:84%
The levitation system
that the sphere had,

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.010 align:middle line:84%
it probably had a
few shocks into it.

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Still a little bit of
use after the water

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:90%
dried that we poured into it.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Were you able to
activate the sphere at all?

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID VÉLEZ: No.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.140 align:middle line:84%
That's why I saw
myself in the position

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.380 align:middle line:84%
to hand it over to experts that
would actually know what they're

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:19.460 align:middle line:84%
handling because this wasn't
something regular human-made.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.950 align:middle line:84%
I discovered the hardness of
the outer shell of the sphere

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.350 align:middle line:84%
because we tried to
run some tests into it

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.720 align:middle line:90%
and we couldn't do it.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And it has the hardest
aluminum we know so far.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole different alloy
than the one industries use.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So, based
off everything you've

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:84%
seen, all the data
that you've researched,

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.750 align:middle line:84%
and what you're seeing today
with the further scientific

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.130 align:middle line:84%
research, what do you
think we're dealing with?

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.063 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:14:44.063 --> 00:14:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID VÉLEZ: We're dealing
with an artifact that belongs

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.350 align:middle line:90%
to non-human intelligence.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: We now know the Buga
Sphere is not one of a kind.

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Similar spheres have
been recorded globally,

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.090 align:middle line:84%
suggesting an ongoing
pattern of sightings,

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.200 align:middle line:84%
but no other footage has matched
the clarity or significance

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:90%
of what came next.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Just a few months after the
Buga sighting, on June 7, 2025,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.840 align:middle line:84%
a nearly identical object
appeared in Yumbo, Colombia,

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.880 align:middle line:90%
only 40 miles from Buga.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Captured on video by
construction contractor William

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Zúñiga, the sphere,
once again, appeared

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.770 align:middle line:84%
to approach
high-voltage power lines

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.380 align:middle line:84%
before dropping behind the
sugarcane, briefly hidden

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.970 align:middle line:90%
from the camera's view.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIME MAUSSAN: Now I'd like
to introduce William Antonio

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:32.538 align:middle line:84%
Zúñiga, who personally
decided to make this public.

00:15:32.538 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM ZÚÑIGA: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:38.500 align:middle line:10%
I ran into this phenomenon
at the township of Yumbo.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.880 align:middle line:84%
This is a sugarcane
plantation right here.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.640 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
sighting was made.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And you can hear the sound
that the sphere is making when

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:54.450 align:middle line:90%
it gets close to the sugarcane.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:58.650 align:middle line:84%
When we heard the
whoosh, I saw the sphere

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:01.800 align:middle line:84%
going up from the
sugarcane crops.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I brought up my
phone and I started recording,

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:09.780 align:middle line:84%
the sphere had
already approximated

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.810 align:middle line:90%
some high-tension cable wires.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:15.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why it was
interested in the wire--

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.590 align:middle line:90%
in the lines.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes down
into the sugarcane field,

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.380 align:middle line:90%
it makes a whooshing sound.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And while it's rotating
while I'm filming it,

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:30.680 align:middle line:84%
I can see the ring
around the sphere.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: I got
called by Jaime.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:36.150 align:middle line:10%
He called me a while later and
said, "There's another one.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:38.430 align:middle line:10%
There's another one flying
around down by Columbia,

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.570 align:middle line:10%
the same place."

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:40.830 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "That's great."

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:43.220 align:middle line:84%
I said, "We've got the great
advantage here of having not

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.540 align:middle line:84%
only one in custody, but
another one still operational."

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I said, "So this is what
you really want to have."

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: With two
sightings confirmed,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.240 align:middle line:84%
the need for scientific
analysis grew stronger.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Engineer Rodolfo Garrido,
a materials specialist

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.610 align:middle line:84%
based in Mexico,
led that effort,

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.540 align:middle line:84%
conducting an independent
evaluation of the sphere's

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.380 align:middle line:90%
structure and composition.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:84%
His analysis revealed
something unexpected--

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.010 align:middle line:84%
a structure that defied
standard manufacturing

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and hinted at origins
not yet understood.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIME MAUSSAN: We got in
touch with Mexico's Autonomous

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:21.569 align:middle line:84%
University, and as Rodolfo
Garrido will confirm,

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:24.750 align:middle line:84%
the results are
absolutely extraordinary.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.480 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Rodolfo.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RODOLFO GARRIDO
COTHAM: Thank you.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.390 align:middle line:10%
I would like to share
all of the results

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:35.740 align:middle line:10%
from the investigations
that were made in situ.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:41.650 align:middle line:84%
The first study that we realized
is a magnetic field research,

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:43.130 align:middle line:90%
if it had one.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:47.570 align:middle line:84%
But there's zero magnetic field
which is emanating right now.

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to do
a metallurgical analysis

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.510 align:middle line:90%
on the sphere.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:57.740 align:middle line:84%
We marked four different zones,
one at the northern hemisphere,

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.600 align:middle line:84%
one at the southern hemisphere,
and one at the equator.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:84%
We polished them to reach
the first layer of the metal,

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:11.620 align:middle line:84%
and we realized that there's
different thicknesses

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.010 align:middle line:90%
around the sphere.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.970 align:middle line:84%
That means the northern
hemisphere is thicker

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.130 align:middle line:90%
than the southern hemisphere.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.760 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the
central part has got

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.430 align:middle line:10%
different metallurgical
properties

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:28.110 align:middle line:10%
than the southern and
northern hemispheres.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And then there's something
that is quite interesting.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:36.280 align:middle line:84%
When we started researching
the central part of the sphere,

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.990 align:middle line:84%
we began to realize that
there are certain cracks

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:44.410 align:middle line:84%
and that there was something
inside those cracks.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And we got 6
milligrams of samples

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:54.100 align:middle line:84%
from this sphere, which we put
under an electron microscope.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:90%
And what we saw was motivating.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.330 align:middle line:90%
We discovered the following.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.860 align:middle line:84%
What you're
witnessing right here.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Fiber optics at
different diameters,

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:12.100 align:middle line:84%
but if there's different
diameters on each fiber,

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.680 align:middle line:84%
then each one has
its own function.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Everything from communication to
satellite communication as well.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:23.620 align:middle line:84%
If there's any doubt that
these are fiber optics,

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:28.860 align:middle line:84%
then we took the fiber optic
to the electron microscope

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.480 align:middle line:84%
and we measured the
diameter of the fiber

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.580 align:middle line:90%
optics and the composition.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And the composition talks about
oxalate, silicate, and zinc.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:46.070 align:middle line:10%
We also saw a coating
that enveloped the metal.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.270 align:middle line:10%
It was like a polymer coating.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:52.640 align:middle line:10%
And it's made of carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen. So

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:57.690 align:middle line:10%
the fiber optics, what's inside
the fiber optics is nothing new.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:03.360 align:middle line:10%
It goes hand-in-hand with what
we know about fiber optics,

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.840 align:middle line:10%
and it's present
within the Buga Sphere.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.810 align:middle line:84%
This gives us the
first solid step.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And the next step is not
going to be done randomly.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.680 align:middle line:84%
We're going to base ourselves
on different institutions,

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:84%
different research
studies so that we

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.020 align:middle line:90%
obtain a scientific result.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: As a
scientist, right now,

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.670 align:middle line:84%
based off your work and
all the available data,

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.327 align:middle line:84%
what do you think we're
dealing with here?

00:20:31.327 --> 00:20:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RODOLFO GARRIDO COTHAM:
Something extraordinary.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:37.610 align:middle line:10%
The sphere contains cutting-edge
technology such as fiber optics.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.640 align:middle line:84%
The functions of
the fiber optics

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.990 align:middle line:84%
are to observe a lot of things,
even space communication.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.200 align:middle line:10%
The fibers from
300 to 400 microns

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.470 align:middle line:10%
are used to sense what
happens in the atmosphere.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:55.360 align:middle line:10%
The fibers of 100 to 150 microns
can sense biomolecules just

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.600 align:middle line:10%
like our cells.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.480 align:middle line:84%
The question is, if
everything can be sensed,

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.480 align:middle line:90%
why do they want it for?

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.120 align:middle line:84%
What is the intelligence
actually doing?

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.490 align:middle line:90%
Where is it going to?

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Those are the questions
we are asking.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So right now, it
is suggesting something

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:14.230 align:middle line:84%
highly anomalous,
but it's too early

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:15.950 align:middle line:90%
to tell exactly what it is.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:17.575 align:middle line:84%
>>RODOLFO GARRIDO
COTHAM: The next step

00:21:17.575 --> 00:21:19.870 align:middle line:84%
is to study every bit
of the fiber optics

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:22.900 align:middle line:84%
within the Buga Sphere,
and at the same time,

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.530 align:middle line:84%
a device is being made
that will make the sphere

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.490 align:middle line:90%
spin at various speeds.

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.850 align:middle line:84%
When you spin the electrical
reactive materials

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:32.640 align:middle line:84%
inside of the sphere, you
will generate high currents

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.760 align:middle line:84%
of electricity, generally
static, that can only

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.420 align:middle line:90%
be done if you spin the sphere.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.150 align:middle line:84%
If we made the right static
and the right amount of it,

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:41.890 align:middle line:90%
we could make it levitate.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.792 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

00:21:44.792 --> 00:21:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>RODOLFO GARRIDO COTHAM: No.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.820 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
one I've ever seen

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.850 align:middle line:90%
in my life that has no seams.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:56.260 align:middle line:84%
It's my own theory of
how this sphere operates,

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.130 align:middle line:84%
and when I witnessed the
videos, the first question

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.640 align:middle line:84%
I asked myself was,
where's the energy

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:90%
source so that it levitates?

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Where is that energy source?

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Engineer Ávila didn't
detect any batteries.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:16.710 align:middle line:84%
We only saw a nucleus with
three different densities, which

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:19.280 align:middle line:90%
I would like to share with you.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.680 align:middle line:84%
This is the nucleus,
and it's real.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.140 align:middle line:84%
This is an image that
was made of the sphere.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:30.180 align:middle line:10%
When I saw this, I asked
myself, once again,

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:33.300 align:middle line:10%
where's the energy source
for it to levitate?

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.260 align:middle line:10%
I was reminded of Nikola Tesla.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Nikola Tesla experimented
with his famous tower,

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.870 align:middle line:90%
the Wardenclyffe.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:48.540 align:middle line:10%
As you can tell, this Tesla
tower, if you see it vertically,

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:52.640 align:middle line:10%
you can see that there's a tube
that goes down the center, which

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.690 align:middle line:10%
is an electrical conductor.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:59.090 align:middle line:10%
It goes underground, and
we have certain pallets

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:01.940 align:middle line:10%
that are being generated
with the current.

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:03.980 align:middle line:84%
It generates an
electric current,

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.540 align:middle line:90%
and it's distributed up top.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And when the plates move, it
generates the necessary charge.

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.770 align:middle line:84%
So then I asked
myself the following--

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.870 align:middle line:84%
what if we grabbed
the Tesla tower

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:20.450 align:middle line:84%
and we inserted it
into the sphere?

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.230 align:middle line:84%
These charges are
going to be distributed

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:24.500 align:middle line:90%
throughout the sphere.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:29.740 align:middle line:10%
But what if we make it rotate so
there's friction at the center?

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So when we start to
make the sphere rotate,

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:84%
we start generating
different fields.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:40.940 align:middle line:10%
It was in 1832 that
Charles Darwin,

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:44.090 align:middle line:10%
he discovered
spiders on his boat.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:48.580 align:middle line:10%
He thought that the spiders were
being transported by the wind

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:54.730 align:middle line:10%
currents, but it was opposite
from what Tesla knew.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:56.590 align:middle line:10%
What really happened
with those spiders

00:23:56.590 --> 00:24:02.260 align:middle line:10%
going on to Darwin's
ship is the following.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:06.310 align:middle line:84%
You see how the spiders
shoot up in the air?

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:10.280 align:middle line:84%
The spider fixed
itself onto the trunk,

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.805 align:middle line:90%
which has negative charges.

00:24:11.805 --> 00:24:14.740 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And then the static
makes the spider rise,

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.540 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
difference in potential,

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and that's why the
spiders levitate as such,

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:84%
and they can travel for
thousands of kilometers.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
of having them stop

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.800 align:middle line:84%
is by cutting their
spider webs altogether.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:40.140 align:middle line:84%
But they're using the spider web
as a rail and static as a fuel.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:44.570 align:middle line:84%
If you generate a
current, it will

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:48.140 align:middle line:84%
generate an electric
charge, which

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.570 align:middle line:90%
will be eventually discharged.

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:53.640 align:middle line:84%
They are being
moved due to static.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:84%
We can do a comparison of a
spider flying through the air

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:00.990 align:middle line:90%
with the Buga Sphere.

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Look how they're levitating
in the same fashion.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:08.480 align:middle line:84%
We suspect that the
sphere is levitating

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:13.250 align:middle line:84%
thanks to static fields that are
reacting with the atmosphere.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:17.090 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason why if it
touches high-voltage wires,

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:21.400 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be discharged,
causing disequilibrium

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.460 align:middle line:90%
on the inside and it descends.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And when we start
to make it spin

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:30.200 align:middle line:84%
and when we create friction
on the interior of the sphere,

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.380 align:middle line:84%
it creates electricity,
it creates static,

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.690 align:middle line:84%
and we assume that
it will levitate.

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Adding to the
investigation, David Ávila

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Roldán, a chemical
engineer and CEO

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.250 align:middle line:84%
of a Mexican
company specializing

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.320 align:middle line:84%
in automotive
components, conducted

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.690 align:middle line:84%
a detailed analysis of the
sphere's material composition.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:51.790 align:middle line:84%
His tests revealed highly
refined industrial-grade alloys

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:54.820 align:middle line:84%
with no welds, no
seams, and no signs

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.790 align:middle line:84%
of conventional fabrication,
raising even more questions

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.593 align:middle line:84%
about how the object
was made and by whom.

00:26:00.593 --> 00:26:02.260 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID ÁVILA ROLDÁN:
The main objective

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:06.200 align:middle line:10%
of this research and the
tests that we conducted

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:11.550 align:middle line:10%
is to identify what
type of technology

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:14.470 align:middle line:10%
was used to fabricate
this sphere.

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:20.050 align:middle line:84%
We realized that it's made of
aluminum with a high purity

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:20.850 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:23.080 align:middle line:84%
At the bottom part
of the sphere,

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.700 align:middle line:84%
we see a pattern, a
percussion pattern that we

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.870 align:middle line:90%
see as part of the moons.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And the etchings were
made with physical tools

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.710 align:middle line:90%
made from silicate carbon.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And where we have the
perforations or the points,

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.080 align:middle line:90%
I think we have a polymer here.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And with the
microphotographic study,

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.160 align:middle line:84%
it tells us that this
polymer is protected.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:52.090 align:middle line:84%
It's coated with an
unknown material,

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:53.746 align:middle line:90%
which we have not identified.

00:26:53.746 --> 00:26:56.470 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:57.270 align:middle line:90%


00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So David,
one of the aspects

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.920 align:middle line:84%
of the sphere that really
fascinates me is these etchings.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.560 align:middle line:84%
The etchings are,
as you described,

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.450 align:middle line:84%
they look like they
were hand-drawn.

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:08.507 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:27:08.507 --> 00:27:09.590 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID ÁVILA ROLDÁN: Yes.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.150 align:middle line:10%
The marks were made
with a pointed striker.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:15.140 align:middle line:10%
The strikes were probably
made of silicon carbide

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.170 align:middle line:10%
and were struck, let's
say, like the moons

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.180 align:middle line:10%
because that's the only place
where there's a percussion.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Is it possible that the
sphere itself, the technology

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:26.910 align:middle line:84%
within it, is
non-human intelligence,

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.543 align:middle line:84%
but just the etchings
are made by humans?

00:27:29.543 --> 00:27:31.460 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID ÁVILA ROLDÁN:
Yes, that's more likely.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:34.490 align:middle line:10%
That the technology used for
the interior of the sphere

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:36.860 align:middle line:10%
may be from a being
that is half-human and

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.750 align:middle line:10%
half-extraterrestrial.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: If the sphere
itself is ET tech,

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and there's all these
inscriptions on it,

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:47.040 align:middle line:84%
that means, potentially,
once upon a time,

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.880 align:middle line:84%
it came down to the ground and
a culture got its hands on it.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.535 align:middle line:84%
Is that what we're
suggesting here?

00:27:53.535 --> 00:27:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID ÁVILA ROLDÁN:
Everything points

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:58.700 align:middle line:84%
to this sphere having been
manufactured in ancient times.

00:27:58.700 --> 00:27:59.990 align:middle line:90%
By whom?

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:04.160 align:middle line:84%
We don't know, but it was with
a very simple manual engraving

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:08.540 align:middle line:84%
process on the surface, made by
casting in wet sand in stages,

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:11.050 align:middle line:84%
but with a lot of
technology inside it.

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And we can see this at
the equator of the sphere

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:17.540 align:middle line:84%
where fiber optics have
already been detected.

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Like right now,
based off all the data

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.580 align:middle line:84%
you've seen in your
own investigation,

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:25.930 align:middle line:84%
what is the most anomalous
or interesting thing

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:27.110 align:middle line:90%
about this sphere?

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.760 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID ÁVILA ROLDÁN:
We didn't talk

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.510 align:middle line:10%
about this feature
in the conference,

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:33.340 align:middle line:10%
but I want to tell you that for
me, the most fascinating thing

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.160 align:middle line:10%
is that when scanning the
surface of the sphere,

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.430 align:middle line:10%
the engravings do not
appear in the point cloud

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:41.590 align:middle line:10%
so that we can scan them.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:44.650 align:middle line:10%
At first, we thought it was
the resolution of the scanner

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:47.420 align:middle line:10%
because we were working
at 0.7 millimeters.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.530 align:middle line:84%
We increased the resolution
to 0.5 millimeters

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and still couldn't
record those engravings.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: So what does that mean?

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:55.565 align:middle line:90%
What is that implying?

00:28:55.565 --> 00:28:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID ÁVILA ROLDÁN: There is
a theory that we are working on,

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:00.290 align:middle line:84%
but we still have a
lot of work to do.

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:03.520 align:middle line:84%
We need to try to find the
origin of this effect that

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.950 align:middle line:84%
is being caused by the
inside of the sphere.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:10.060 align:middle line:84%
What I have observed is that it
not only affects the 3D scanner,

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.530 align:middle line:84%
it also affects the temperature,
and it also affected us in terms

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:14.520 align:middle line:90%
of hardness.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: No one could confidently
determine the meaning

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:18.250 align:middle line:90%
of the symbols on the sphere.

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:21.510 align:middle line:84%
An AI analysis couldn't find a
match in the existing language

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.570 align:middle line:90%
databases.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:26.250 align:middle line:84%
But Dr. Steven Greer, a retired
physician and long-time advocate

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:29.920 align:middle line:84%
for UFO disclosure, shared a
fascinating take in response.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.710 align:middle line:10%
>>GREER: And I'd just
like to recognize

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:35.770 align:middle line:10%
the courageous people who
picked it up and brought it.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, there have been
spheres found before,

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.720 align:middle line:84%
and in the United
States, special forces

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.150 align:middle line:84%
thugs go in and get
them, and people have

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.690 align:middle line:90%
been killed possessing them.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Very smart that you keep it safe
and that you also disclose it.

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:53.350 align:middle line:90%
It's transparent.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:54.520 align:middle line:90%
Everything goes out.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.270 align:middle line:84%
My assessment of
this is pending,

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.500 align:middle line:90%
but it's certainly real.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.270 align:middle line:84%
It's using an energy field,
and what we probably would say

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:07.160 align:middle line:84%
is electrogravitic, which means
a type of anti-gravity effect

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:11.360 align:middle line:84%
from the electromagnetic
forces, and whether it

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.910 align:middle line:84%
is of purely
extraterrestrial origin

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:18.890 align:middle line:84%
or a mix of an ancient
human-extraterrestrial

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:20.100 align:middle line:90%
development.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.370 align:middle line:10%
And I just want to
share, two days ago,

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:27.530 align:middle line:10%
we debriefed a Green Beret who--

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:33.145 align:middle line:10%
he was in a subterranean
facility, Crane, Indiana,

00:30:33.145 --> 00:30:36.960 align:middle line:10%
it's a naval weapons station,
and this is a top Green Beret--

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.360 align:middle line:10%
not many years ago.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:42.050 align:middle line:10%
And he was taken underground,
very deep, and was shown

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:45.470 align:middle line:10%
several extraterrestrial
devices, one of which

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:50.040 align:middle line:10%
had a device, like
a translucent--

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.070 align:middle line:10%
almost like a small iPad,
but extraterrestrial.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was putting, up above
that screen, a series of letters

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:02.960 align:middle line:90%
or symbols in deep Ink black.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And they are on this sphere,
four or five of them.

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.050 align:middle line:90%
So very unusual.

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:11.830 align:middle line:10%
Now this gentleman,
he didn't have

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.810 align:middle line:10%
any association
with those symbols

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.470 align:middle line:10%
until he saw this sphere.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:18.370 align:middle line:84%
But he said these are
exactly the symbols that

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:22.790 align:middle line:84%
were floating above this
device in the air about a foot,

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:25.722 align:middle line:84%
and that they had some
effect in his awareness,

00:31:25.722 --> 00:31:27.430 align:middle line:84%
and that he thought
that it had something

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:31.240 align:middle line:84%
to do with activation of DNA
and consciousness, some very

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.000 align:middle line:90%
unusual effect.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.530 align:middle line:10%
>>ANDERSON: Coincidentally,
weeks before the conference,

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:38.830 align:middle line:10%
I had interviewed Randy
Anderson for an upcoming

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.810 align:middle line:10%
episode of Cosmic
Disclosure, and this

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:42.957 align:middle line:10%
is what he had to say
regarding the symbols.

00:31:42.957 --> 00:31:45.040 align:middle line:10%
>>RANDY ANDERSON: We went
through another security

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.320 align:middle line:10%
checkpoint, and that was
very odd because we already

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.737 align:middle line:10%
went through this-- like a
high-level security checkpoint.

00:31:49.737 --> 00:31:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And then went into
another hallway

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:55.870 align:middle line:84%
and walked up to a room that
had a placard on the wall

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.260 align:middle line:90%
and said Offworld Technology.

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Really?

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: The
room was probably

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:01.720 align:middle line:90%
about maybe 30 feet long.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Uh huh.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Maybe 20 feet wide.

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And there were two
cubicles that were facing

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:10.660 align:middle line:90%
towards us as we entered.

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And in that first cubicle,
there was an object,

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:15.580 align:middle line:90%
and a podium below it.

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked at it, the
object above the podium

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.950 align:middle line:90%
was a sphere, a metallic sphere.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was hovering above
the podium, it was under it,

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.590 align:middle line:84%
and there was nothing contact--
no contact between those two

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:29.590 align:middle line:84%
things, that was the first
thing that I noticed.

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So just a
pure metallic sphere.

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:33.450 align:middle line:90%
Roughly how big?

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: About the
size of a basketball.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Can you please describe
what else you saw in the room?

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: So we
walked down a little,

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.048 align:middle line:84%
they started
walking ahead of us,

00:32:39.048 --> 00:32:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and we followed them
down a little further,

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed there was another
object in the next section over.

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was sitting
on a black table

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.750 align:middle line:90%
about 3 feet off the ground.

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: And what was it?

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Just a
rectangular metal object.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: What about it made it
seem anomalous or different?

00:32:57.730 --> 00:32:58.623 align:middle line:90%
Or made you think--

00:32:58.623 --> 00:33:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: It was just
an odd-looking object.

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.520 align:middle line:84%
It was-- it's just oddly-shaped,
oddly-looking the way

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.320 align:middle line:90%
the corners were.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's
difficult to describe.

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:09.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm pulling on a memory
from a while ago.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.750 align:middle line:84%
But as I'm looking
at it, I could

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:16.140 align:middle line:84%
see symbols start to appear
above where that LCD screen was.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Symbols?

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Yes.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Like, hieroglyphic lettering,
but the strange thing

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:24.780 align:middle line:84%
about the letters, they were
real crisp, almost inky black.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: OK.

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Almost
like a dark ink.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.140 align:middle line:90%
But very crisp.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.660 align:middle line:84%
You can make out what
they were very clear.

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's nothing I'd ever
seen, no symbols I'd ever

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.470 align:middle line:90%
seen before that.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.563 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So from what I
understand, these symbols,

00:33:36.563 --> 00:33:37.980 align:middle line:84%
you've done some
sketches of them.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.090 align:middle line:90%
Can you show us those sketches?

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:40.020 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk us through it?

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:40.978 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Yeah, sure.

00:33:40.978 --> 00:33:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So I recall the best
I could from memory.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.960 align:middle line:84%
I'd say the first
several of the ones

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.168 align:middle line:90%
that I remember the clearest.

00:33:49.168 --> 00:33:49.968 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Wow.

00:33:49.968 --> 00:33:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And I tried
to get as much as I could.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:55.580 align:middle line:84%
But these are as close
as I can pull from memory

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:56.985 align:middle line:90%
with what I saw.

00:33:56.985 --> 00:33:58.840 align:middle line:84%
What was odd about
them is how they were--

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.440 align:middle line:90%
the symbols weren't solid.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.570 align:middle line:84%
They were shifting
between these symbols.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So there was probably about,
I would say, six or seven

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.200 align:middle line:90%
in a row.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And they were
transitioning between--

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:11.570 align:middle line:84%
they would just phase in
and out at different times,

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:12.590 align:middle line:90%
like alternating.

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:15.460 align:middle line:84%
They had asked us again
and what we thought,

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:19.190 align:middle line:84%
if we noticed anything odd, and
everything about this was odd.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.880 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't mention
to them that I

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.739 align:middle line:90%
saw the symbols at the time.

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: This Special
Guy Report wouldn't

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:28.179 align:middle line:84%
be complete without speaking
with Jaime Maussan, who

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:31.150 align:middle line:84%
led the high-profile Buga Sphere
press conference, bringing

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:33.610 align:middle line:84%
together international
scientists, eyewitnesses,

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:35.060 align:middle line:90%
and policymakers.

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Through his influence, a
landmark, multidisciplinary

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:39.969 align:middle line:84%
effort was launched
to study the sphere

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:42.460 align:middle line:84%
and explore the possibility
that it may involve

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:44.840 align:middle line:90%
advanced anomalous technology.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>>: Jaime, thank you for
doing this interview,

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.775 align:middle line:84%
and congratulations on a really
successful press conference.

00:34:49.775 --> 00:34:50.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Thank you, Josh.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:51.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: I came in as
a skeptic, but I feel

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.050 align:middle line:90%
like I'm leaving as a believer.

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:59.430 align:middle line:10%
>>MAUSSAN: You have to
because we have an object,

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:03.420 align:middle line:10%
and according to all the
scientific investigation,

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:07.450 align:middle line:10%
it's an object that presents
very advanced technology.

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:08.680 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:14.970 align:middle line:84%
The other is that we have
the evidence, the videos that

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:18.540 align:middle line:84%
recorded these objects,
and one of them

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:23.070 align:middle line:84%
flying around, around
Buga, and descending,

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:24.850 align:middle line:90%
and now we can talk about it.

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:27.150 align:middle line:84%
But you have this
video where you

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:31.090 align:middle line:84%
can prove that if
the video is real,

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:34.950 align:middle line:84%
then this thing was flying,
it means that you have

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:37.090 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial technology.

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:41.203 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very good reason
to make you a believer.

00:35:41.203 --> 00:35:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Of all the science
that was presented,

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.040 align:middle line:84%
what do you think the audience
should know the most about?

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Or what would you
like to highlight?

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Well,
I think something

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:52.050 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't mentioned
specifically in the conference,

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and I think was the
most important thing,

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:58.140 align:middle line:84%
is that these spheres
are real sensors.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:03.590 align:middle line:84%
It means that they are here
to know everything about us.

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:06.950 align:middle line:10%
We found that this
sphere, it has

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:11.480 align:middle line:10%
fiber optics around the
equator, and that fiber optics

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.970 align:middle line:10%
is used to really know
everything about us.

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:17.580 align:middle line:84%
It's fiber optics
that can see at night,

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:22.010 align:middle line:84%
can see in the ultraviolet,
in the infrared.

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And it means that they
have all the information

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:25.610 align:middle line:90%
they need from us.

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And that these spheres are real
sensors that are spying on us.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't see for them--

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't think for
the bad reasons.

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:35.370 align:middle line:90%
They know everything about us.

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:38.130 align:middle line:10%
After I talked to
Dr. Steven Greer,

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:42.500 align:middle line:10%
I found that the fiber
optics that they found,

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:46.020 align:middle line:10%
that his scientists
found these fiber optics,

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:50.800 align:middle line:10%
but they realized that they are
not connected into the sphere

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.290 align:middle line:10%
through wires or cables.

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:55.570 align:middle line:10%
And that's amazing
because they are

00:36:55.570 --> 00:37:00.190 align:middle line:10%
connected through the same
structure of the sphere.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:04.160 align:middle line:84%
It means it's a technology
far away from us.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.870 align:middle line:84%
We have the fiber optics, and
probably these fiber optics came

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:10.400 align:middle line:90%
from UFOs in the 1940s.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.640 align:middle line:10%
We know that through
Philip Corso.

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:17.320 align:middle line:10%
But now we know that these fiber
optics is even more advanced

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:21.260 align:middle line:10%
because it is integrated
into the object,

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.840 align:middle line:10%
and it's something
that we are going

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:28.270 align:middle line:10%
to try to learn how it's
done, but that proof by itself

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:33.800 align:middle line:10%
would make real that this
object is not from Earth.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So right
now, the fiber optics

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:36.868 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing in
the sphere, there's

00:37:36.868 --> 00:37:38.750 align:middle line:84%
nothing like that
anywhere on Earth?

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: We have fiber
optics, but also fiber optics,

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:46.940 align:middle line:84%
you need a wire, and this wire
needs to be always in one piece.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:49.830 align:middle line:84%
If you cut it, then
you lose the light,

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and then you cannot have the
information on the other side.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.980 align:middle line:84%
But in this kind
of fiber optics,

00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:02.080 align:middle line:84%
they are just like sensors in
the holes around the sphere,

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and now they are integrated
into the structure,

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and it means that it's
something very different.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.690 align:middle line:84%
That also is something
very different

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:14.620 align:middle line:90%
is what is inside the sphere.

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:16.240 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a jar.

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a device.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:21.000 align:middle line:10%
And this device probably
creates the energy

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.440 align:middle line:10%
for the sphere to levitate.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:28.330 align:middle line:10%
We know that this sphere
levitates through static.

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:31.830 align:middle line:84%
We don't think now that
these kind of spheres

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:34.540 align:middle line:90%
levitate through anti-gravity.

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:38.220 align:middle line:84%
It means that all
this time, we thought

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.900 align:middle line:84%
that UFOs were able
to neutralize gravity,

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and that's why they
were able to float.

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:47.690 align:middle line:84%
But now we know that probably
through this sphere, that they

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:53.150 align:middle line:84%
use a stronger energy,
electromagnetic energy so

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:56.490 align:middle line:90%
much stronger than the gravity.

00:38:56.490 --> 00:39:00.300 align:middle line:84%
It means that I think
we gave a step forward.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And that brings me
to probably what

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.060 align:middle line:84%
is the most important
thing with this sphere.

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:08.570 align:middle line:90%
It's in the hands of civilians.

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:12.890 align:middle line:84%
For the first time ever,
something like this

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:15.240 align:middle line:90%
is not in the hands of military.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not in the
hands of governments.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.840 align:middle line:84%
It means that if we are
able to investigate,

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:25.890 align:middle line:84%
if we find the resources,
if we find the scientists,

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:29.810 align:middle line:84%
very, very soon, all
this technology will

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:33.780 align:middle line:84%
be available for human
beings, for humanity.

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.540 align:middle line:90%
This could change our future.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Not just accepting that there
is another presence, that there

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:45.330 align:middle line:84%
are other beings
here, but also to

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.750 align:middle line:84%
allow us to have this
kind of technology.

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: I love it.

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:50.050 align:middle line:90%
So what's next with the science?

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:51.168 align:middle line:90%
Where are you at now?

00:39:51.168 --> 00:39:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: We want
to try to find out

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.990 align:middle line:90%
to know exactly how it works.

00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:58.780 align:middle line:84%
We are going to try to
find out how it levitates.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.920 align:middle line:10%
We know, for example, that
this sphere can change

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:05.050 align:middle line:10%
the hardness of the structure.

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:08.320 align:middle line:84%
We know it changes the
temperature of the structure.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.500 align:middle line:84%
What it means, all that,
and why it does that?

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Why the sphere, when it
came down, weighed 2 kilos?

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And then 6 kilos, and then
9 kilos, and then 10 kilos?

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:20.530 align:middle line:90%
We need to know.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:24.070 align:middle line:84%
We have some ideas
how this happens,

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:26.215 align:middle line:90%
but we need to know for sure.

00:40:26.215 --> 00:40:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: A lot of people
out there are saying,

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:29.400 align:middle line:84%
why don't you just
cut this thing in half

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.220 align:middle line:90%
and see what's inside?

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Never.

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:31.470 align:middle line:90%
Never, ever.

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:32.710 align:middle line:90%
Over my dead body.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Why?

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: No, because if
you do that, you destroy.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.890 align:middle line:90%
You destroy all of this.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:40.060 align:middle line:90%
Just to look inside?

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Try to find a way to look inside
without hurting the sphere.

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:49.860 align:middle line:84%
The sphere is going to
be kept as it is forever,

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.330 align:middle line:90%
at least until I die.

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:54.390 align:middle line:84%
If someone after I
die wants to cut it,

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:55.980 align:middle line:90%
I won't be able to stop it.

00:40:55.980 --> 00:41:00.205 align:middle line:84%
But from now on, I mean, the
sphere will stay as it is.

00:41:00.205 --> 00:41:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Are there
any other tests

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:02.788 align:middle line:90%
that they're doing right now?

00:41:02.788 --> 00:41:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Mr. Greer took
samples of the metal.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:14.330 align:middle line:84%
They're going to try to find if
the isotopes inside the metal

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:17.970 align:middle line:84%
are from Earth or
from somewhere else.

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And the carbon-14 analysis
to know how old is

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:25.940 align:middle line:84%
are two very important
details that probably,

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.400 align:middle line:84%
in the next few
weeks, we will have

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.992 align:middle line:90%
more information about that.

00:41:29.992 --> 00:41:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: After wrapping
my interview with Jaime,

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.470 align:middle line:84%
I returned to the hotel
and sat down for dinner.

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:36.320 align:middle line:84%
But almost
immediately, something

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:40.140 align:middle line:84%
unexpected and deeply unsettling
was already in motion.

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:42.430 align:middle line:84%
An incident that
raised new questions

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:45.610 align:middle line:84%
and suggested that someone,
somewhere, was already

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:47.103 align:middle line:90%
trying to take control of it.

00:41:47.103 --> 00:41:48.770 align:middle line:84%
You and I were both
down there together.

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes.

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: I believe you flew
out right when this happened.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I was at the hotel across
the street from the facility.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.410 align:middle line:10%
But two men, who I've seen
them on security footage now,

00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:01.270 align:middle line:10%
showed up dressed as policemen
and tried to take the sphere.

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:02.540 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:04.067 align:middle line:90%
Is that, one, unusual?

00:42:04.067 --> 00:42:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Or is that exactly
what we should have

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:07.240 align:middle line:90%
expected in this situation?

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:10.150 align:middle line:10%
>>SHEEHAN: A sphere
like this, if it's

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:13.360 align:middle line:10%
anything like what
people think it is,

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.630 align:middle line:10%
of being some anomalous object
that is actually flying around

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:20.170 align:middle line:10%
without any kind of means
of propulsion or anything,

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.280 align:middle line:10%
that it's worth a lot of money.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.067 align:middle line:10%
And so for a couple of
guys, even a few guys,

00:42:25.067 --> 00:42:26.650 align:middle line:10%
to come up with the
idea, why don't we

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:29.420 align:middle line:10%
dress up law enforcement
people and pretend

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.420 align:middle line:10%
we're coming here to take
it for the government,

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:33.310 align:middle line:10%
and maybe we can
get away with it.

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:37.472 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't mean that it's
some kind of government plot,

00:42:37.472 --> 00:42:39.930 align:middle line:84%
or else there would have been
a lot better at it, probably.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Right.

00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And it's-- so I
assume that that's primarily

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.080 align:middle line:90%
what it was.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.230 align:middle line:84%
When the American government
comes in to take something,

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:48.272 align:middle line:90%
they come in and take it.

00:42:48.272 --> 00:42:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And they hit you with force,
and they've rehearsed it,

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.670 align:middle line:90%
they know how to do it.

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's like
Mission Impossible.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:57.030 align:middle line:90%
They'll come and get it.

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: When these objects crash
or people get them in there,

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and when people
have these objects--

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They
come and get them.

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: They come and
get it, and it's just

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:03.550 align:middle line:90%
a whole different scenario.

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And they come
and get them in Mexico.

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.630 align:middle line:84%
They've come in and gotten
a whole craft in Mexico.

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:12.420 align:middle line:84%
They flew across the border,
a whole team of special forces

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:16.350 align:middle line:84%
went in and took the craft, and
loaded it up and took it away.

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And told the Mexican
government to piss off.

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:22.600 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, they're
not above that stuff.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.390 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
mean that was they.

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:26.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it suggests
that it wasn't they,

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:30.100 align:middle line:84%
or else there wouldn't have
been such a muffed job.

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: OK, so maybe
the guys who showed up

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:34.500 align:middle line:84%
to try to grab this sphere
weren't from one of these legacy

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:35.350 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:37.503 align:middle line:84%
But if it was the
real deal, don't you

00:43:37.503 --> 00:43:39.420 align:middle line:84%
think there would be an
attempt at some point?

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.878 align:middle line:84%
Or has Jaime done such a good
job getting it and putting it

00:43:41.878 --> 00:43:45.150 align:middle line:84%
out publicly so quick that they
can't put their hands on it now?

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: I'm sure there's an
awful lot of conversation going

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:52.370 align:middle line:84%
on about this inside
the legacy program

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:55.460 align:middle line:84%
because if there is
any chance that it

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.790 align:middle line:84%
is either of
extraterrestrial origin

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:02.510 align:middle line:84%
or is the product of
some reverse engineering

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:06.140 align:middle line:84%
from some extraterrestrial
technology,

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.850 align:middle line:84%
our national
security state people

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:10.050 align:middle line:84%
are going to be extremely
interested in this.

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:13.220 align:middle line:84%
But to date, they've
not opened up any kind

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:16.070 align:middle line:90%
of direct conversation with us.

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.680 align:middle line:84%
They haven't contacted
us and said, "Look,

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:25.490 align:middle line:84%
this is Colonel blah,
blah, from the XYZ Agency,

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and we want to open a
dialogue about this thing,

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.920 align:middle line:84%
we want to be partners with
you in trying to find out what

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.100 align:middle line:90%
it's all about, et cetera."

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:38.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a shame that they have so
misused authority that's been

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.880 align:middle line:84%
given to them, discretionary
authority in the past,

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.630 align:middle line:84%
that they have to be distrusted
because I'd be inclined to say,

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:47.470 align:middle line:84%
"OK, look, as long as we can
figure out that we're not

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:50.210 align:middle line:84%
opposed to sharing information
with you about this."

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:52.810 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is, I'm not
willing to share information

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:53.820 align:middle line:90%
with them about it.

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So the
bottom line is,

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:59.870 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to conduct
the investigation of this,

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:02.110 align:middle line:84%
the scientific
analysis of it in as

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:04.340 align:middle line:84%
thorough and as
professional way as we can.

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:06.380 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make it
available to everybody.

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:07.480 align:middle line:90%
The whole human family.

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:09.170 align:middle line:90%
Say, look, here's what this is.

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:10.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
it is yet, but you're

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.280 align:middle line:84%
going to see us conducting
the investigations.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.330 align:middle line:84%
You're going to know what
we know when we know it.

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And if it turns out to be
something of that category,

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:21.110 align:middle line:90%
then so be it.

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:22.610 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
going to find out.

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Well, this
is very exciting.

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:25.515 align:middle line:84%
This feels like this
could be potentially

00:45:25.515 --> 00:45:27.640 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of the people's
disclosure, something

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.527 align:middle line:84%
that we've all been fighting
for for a very long time.

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Danny, thank you for
everything you've

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:33.560 align:middle line:84%
done throughout
your whole career,

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.725 align:middle line:84%
but specifically
disclosure and UAP.

00:45:35.725 --> 00:45:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So thanks for being here today,
we really appreciate your time.

00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:40.017 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: I appreciate
the opportunity.

00:45:40.017 --> 00:45:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: This investigation
is far from over,

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and many questions
remain unanswered.

The object's origins, its
purpose, and how it was made

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.650 align:middle line:84%
are still under review
by those continuing

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:52.050 align:middle line:90%
the analysis behind the scenes.

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Is the Buga Sphere a probe, a
surveillance device, a piece

00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:59.520 align:middle line:84%
of forgotten history, or
something far more advanced?

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, the
sphere didn't just fall,

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:03.450 align:middle line:90%
it sent a signal.

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And to those paying attention,
the implications are clear--

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:11.160 align:middle line:84%
something highly unusual has
entered the story of our world.

As new findings
come to light, we'll

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:14.400 align:middle line:84%
keep you updated
on whether this is

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:17.670 align:middle line:84%
a product of human innovation,
or quite possibly not

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:18.900 align:middle line:90%
of this world.
