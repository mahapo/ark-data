>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.190 align:middle line:10%
we are with Duane Ollinger, a
high-risk oil contractor who

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.500 align:middle line:10%
discovered a system
of underground caverns

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.810 align:middle line:10%
that run beneath
his 160-acre ranch

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.840 align:middle line:10%
in Utah, home to some
highly unusual anomalies.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.480 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us is
Tim, a tactical advisor

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.270 align:middle line:10%
to covert analysts, trying
to understand the missions

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.720 align:middle line:10%
and strategies of non-human
intelligences on our planet.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DUANE OLLINGER: Thank you.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.332 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Duane, can you
tell our viewing audience

00:00:47.332 --> 00:00:49.703 align:middle line:84%
about your connection
with ETs and UFOs?

00:00:49.703 --> 00:00:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Oh, my goodness.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.370 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.610 align:middle line:84%
As far as ETs or UFOs, I
don't know much about the ETs,

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:84%
you would say, but I did
see nine different craft

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.690 align:middle line:84%
up there on the project that
we were on up there on that 160

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.490 align:middle line:90%
acres.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was it that
you were looking for that you

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.800 align:middle line:90%
went through all this expense?

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:84%
90-day expedition with
all your equipment,

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.240 align:middle line:90%
all your people out there.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.703 align:middle line:90%
What were you looking for?

00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Well,
we had been told

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.760 align:middle line:84%
that there was Au and Ag
that was percolating out

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, but that's
what started the whole deal,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.300 align:middle line:84%
and that always brings
the intrigue, you know.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Please explain to the
audience what Ag and Au is.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: So Ag
is silver and then

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Au is gold, and that's what
we were looking for as far as

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.670 align:middle line:84%
on the side of the
mountain, on the West side.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So while you
were looking for this,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.310 align:middle line:84%
did you stumble upon
anything with drilling

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.385 align:middle line:90%
that was abnormal?

00:01:52.385 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Not
on the West side.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.140 align:middle line:90%
We did on the East side.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:84%
George Stevens was the one that
pointed us to the West side

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.830 align:middle line:84%
where we dropped down into
on the side of the mountain

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:84%
when they was using satellite
technology to help us do that.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.139 align:middle line:84%
George Stevens
was, he was ex-CIA.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.320 align:middle line:84%
In the Vietnam era,
they tested people

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.270 align:middle line:90%
for their colorblindness.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And so the way it was explained
to me was where you or I see 16

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.590 align:middle line:90%
shades of grey, he sees 32.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And so in turn, there
was five of those guys,

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.500 align:middle line:90%
and he was one of them.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And so in the Vietnam
era, the Vietnamese

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.740 align:middle line:84%
would tunnel underneath
the mountain,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and they had a satellite
that he told me

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.610 align:middle line:84%
they launched in 1954, where
the Vietnam people would

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.880 align:middle line:84%
tunnel underneath there
and pop up and hit us.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, by that satellite, he
could see the different colors

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.370 align:middle line:84%
of the trees changing
because of their root system

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.580 align:middle line:90%
and the whole nine yards.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And so he would give
them coordinates,

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.750 align:middle line:84%
and then they would
bomb right there

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:90%
at the end of those tunnels.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, George Stevens
found out that Au, Ag, Ir,

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Pt, all these different elements
would also by satellite,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.070 align:middle line:90%
he could see those colors too.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And so he created a company
with that technology,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.760 align:middle line:84%
and because he was tied
to I guess the CIA,

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:84%
he got so much of
satellite time for what

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.520 align:middle line:90%
he's done for the government.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And he showed up on the
project on that 160 acres,

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and he was the one that showed
us that there was Au and Ag.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.670 align:middle line:84%
He never talked about Ir or
Pt or anything like that,

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.020 align:middle line:84%
but he would show us where
the target points were.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
George Stevens
would also, he could

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.810 align:middle line:84%
see an ionic bursts coming out
of the ground by satellite,

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.560 align:middle line:84%
but what he always told us on
that West side of the project

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.600 align:middle line:84%
was that the ions will not
come out exactly straight.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.070 align:middle line:84%
They ricochet off, you might
say, of different reasons.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And he was boots on
the ground out there,

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.030 align:middle line:84%
and he's the one that
told us, he says,

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.370 align:middle line:84%
right here, now this
is a big project.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a lot of
digging, the whole nine yards.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.709 align:middle line:84%
We're on the side of a mountain,
so it might sound easy,

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.550 align:middle line:90%
but it's not.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And so in turn once he told
us exactly where to dig,

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.050 align:middle line:84%
I thought, this is
the craziest thing

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.700 align:middle line:90%
I've ever heard of in my life.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.120 align:middle line:84%
That's where we drilled
down, and we weren't looking

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:90%
for water, but we hit water.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.670 align:middle line:10%
And that's where the blind
frogs started coming up

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.320 align:middle line:10%
out of the ground, so we knew
that the cave systems had

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.370 align:middle line:10%
oxygen, and that's kind of
why we come up with the name

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.130 align:middle line:10%
Blind Frog Ranch.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.217 align:middle line:84%
It didn't take no genius
to figure that one out.

00:04:49.217 --> 00:04:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you went
out there, you're

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.440 align:middle line:90%
drilling for gold, silver.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:84%
You found this underground
water system that's

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:90%
linked to this cavern possibly.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.960 align:middle line:84%
At what time during
this excavation

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.130 align:middle line:84%
did some strange
phenomena happen?

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: So we had to shut
down the West side project,

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and we had to wait
for quite a while

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:84%
where we got where we could
go over on the East side.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we were going to do

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.230 align:middle line:84%
a project on the East side of
our project with Don Nicoloff,

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.050 align:middle line:84%
and he was tied
to Jeremiah Davis.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And who
is Don Nicoloff?

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Don Nicoloff,
he's no longer around.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.430 align:middle line:10%
He passed away, but he was
with "Evident Footprints."

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:37.760 align:middle line:84%
He was a broadcaster for
podcasts and things like that.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.780 align:middle line:90%
He was tied to Jeremiah Davis.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And who's
Jeremiah Davis?

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.040 align:middle line:10%
>>OLLINGER: Jeremiah
Davis, those

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.280 align:middle line:10%
were the two guys that
gave us the target

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.160 align:middle line:10%
points on the East side of that
project where we were supposed

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.690 align:middle line:10%
to dig out a lot of the area on
the side of the mountain, which

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.820 align:middle line:10%
is crazy.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: You mentioned
satellite technology.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that relates
in some way how they knew

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.882 align:middle line:90%
that you would find something?

00:06:05.882 --> 00:06:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Well,
I don't know what

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.040 align:middle line:84%
they were using on
that because that's

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.240 align:middle line:84%
where a different group
was a part of that.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.460 align:middle line:84%
I think they were using more
of an upstairs information way

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.220 align:middle line:84%
past satellite technology
I think because--

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You say upstairs,
meaning maybe some, what?

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Interstellar or mind?

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Well, probably both.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.150 align:middle line:84%
I guess you might
say both on that deal

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.140 align:middle line:84%
because Nicoloff was tied to
a lot of that kind of stuff.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And then he knew Jeremiah
Davis, and Jeremiah Davis

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.373 align:middle line:90%
was tied to the Federation.

00:06:39.373 --> 00:06:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Please explain
what Federation means.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: So that's where
Jeremiah Davis was recruited

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.457 align:middle line:84%
out of, Area 51, into the United
Galactic Federation of Hindon.

00:06:50.457 --> 00:06:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The United Galactic
Federation of Hindon?

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Yes, and
that's what I was told.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's kind of
crazy, but I've seen the ships,

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.260 align:middle line:90%
and so what do you do?

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.120 align:middle line:90%
You don't lie to yourself.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how
many civilizations

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.270 align:middle line:90%
are included in this?

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: So I
was told that there

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.950 align:middle line:90%
was 574 different planets.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:90%
It was a part of that group.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is our planet
part of that group?

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: No,
no, they're still

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:19.540 align:middle line:84%
kind of being watched because
apparently we got a ways to go

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.400 align:middle line:90%
is what I was told.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because we keep
just digging up the planet.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah, no, I
think the problem being is we

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.920 align:middle line:84%
want to be of a warring planet,
and they're more concerned

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.077 align:middle line:84%
about what we might blow
up because it affects

00:07:34.077 --> 00:07:35.160 align:middle line:90%
a lot of different things.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was this relayed
to you and Jeremiah?

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.490 align:middle line:90%
Was this relayed to you?

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yes, yeah, yeah.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Jeremiah would always
talk about that.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:46.450 align:middle line:84%
I would have conversations after
I got involved with those guys.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:50.670 align:middle line:84%
I would talk to Jeremiah
at least once a week

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.620 align:middle line:84%
for a couple of hours,
and he would tell me

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.868 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of things
about what they're doing.

00:07:56.868 --> 00:07:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And how was he
linked to the Federation?

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: He was
a four star general

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.580 align:middle line:90%
for that group of the alliance.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are these
extraterrestrial people

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:90%
or people on the planet Earth?

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: He always told me
that they're all just like us

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.070 align:middle line:90%
up there in their group.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, he did say there's
other things out there,

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:21.960 align:middle line:84%
but their group was all
just like humans like us.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.000 align:middle line:84%
He said they might look
a little bit different,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:84%
a little different eye or
a little bit different ear,

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.690 align:middle line:90%
but nothing too far out there.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what
was your discovery

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.620 align:middle line:90%
after you kept excavating?

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: We did the
digging, and then they

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.940 align:middle line:84%
told us, they said
now what you got

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:84%
to do is bring in
a drilling rig,

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:43.679 align:middle line:84%
and what we brought
in was a rathole rig,

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:46.830 align:middle line:84%
so that has a bit
of about 36 inches.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a big track hoe rig,
and this is a tough deal

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.330 align:middle line:90%
on the side of a mountain.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.205 align:middle line:84%
Theoretically, you've
got to make platforms--

00:08:53.205 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You've got to
level that whole place

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.380 align:middle line:90%
and then go for it.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.142 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: What did you find?

00:08:57.142 --> 00:08:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: So our
biggest deal was

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.260 align:middle line:84%
where we were told
to drill at 75 foot,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.690 align:middle line:90%
we're going to hit something.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.202 align:middle line:84%
And then down the
mountainside at 68 foot,

00:09:06.202 --> 00:09:07.410 align:middle line:90%
we're going to hit something.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.790 align:middle line:90%
He thought, well, this is crazy.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:10.650 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.656 align:middle line:90%
Nobody would know this.

00:09:13.656 --> 00:09:16.600 align:middle line:84%
This land has not been
touched for millions of years.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Now how are they
going to know that?

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And so in turn,
but you could still

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:84%
tell that they knew
something in their eyes.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.160 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, well, whatever.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.060 align:middle line:90%
We'll do it anyway.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.830 align:middle line:84%
So at 75 foot with that big
drilling rig, we hit nothing.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.260 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh gosh,
and now how are you

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.210 align:middle line:90%
going to tell your banker that?

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.750 align:middle line:90%
You don't on a financial deal.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:44.060 align:middle line:84%
But at 76 foot, 77,
all the way to about 83

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.060 align:middle line:84%
when we kept drilling
on down and we

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.820 align:middle line:84%
pulled that Auger up
and swung it around,

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:90%
that's where the blue dirt was.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.150 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.728 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is
blue earth, Duane?

00:09:54.728 --> 00:09:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: I don't know.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I just know that it was
more like a sandstone

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.710 align:middle line:90%
than it was a hard rock.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, these bits are going to
pulverize that a little bit,

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.900 align:middle line:84%
but it still, if
it had been rock,

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.730 align:middle line:84%
it would have come
up in a crumblier--

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.133 align:middle line:90%
but this came up in like a sand.

00:10:10.133 --> 00:10:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Have you ever
seen something like that?

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.760 align:middle line:10%
>>OLLINGER: No, no, never.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And so how they
knew everything--

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:20.600 align:middle line:84%
but once we drilled that 75
foot hole and then we went down

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.090 align:middle line:84%
the side of a mountain
and drilled down to 68,

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:27.020 align:middle line:84%
didn't find anything, went
through 68 on through it,

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:32.580 align:middle line:84%
it was like it was a
sheath of underground blue.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Once we got through those
two different holes, then

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.630 align:middle line:84%
that night is whenever
things got wild.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:middle line:84%
It's like we released a
energy or gave something air.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And again, I know
that sounds crazy,

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.240 align:middle line:84%
but when we drilled
through that blue dirt,

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.660 align:middle line:84%
then we got a call from
Jeremiah Davis that night.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:59.460 align:middle line:84%
We were back in Vernal, Utah,
and we were told that you just

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.780 align:middle line:84%
need to know, since y'all
drilled through those two holes

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.960 align:middle line:84%
that it lit this whole
mountainside where we were

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.818 align:middle line:84%
at up into a blue aura and
lightning strikes were coming

00:11:10.818 --> 00:11:11.860 align:middle line:90%
out of the ground about--

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they seen this
from a satellite you're saying,

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.640 align:middle line:90%
or is it from--

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Jeremiah
Davis had reports

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.460 align:middle line:84%
from his group that was
telling him what was going on.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: All right.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: And so we were
already in Vernal, Utah,

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and I said, we're
going back out.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.150 align:middle line:90%
We got to see this.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Jeremiah Davis told
us, he says, look,

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.070 align:middle line:84%
you don't know what you
stirred up up there.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.850 align:middle line:90%
You should not go out there.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.090 align:middle line:90%
And I think, come on, man.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:84%
We worked too hard not
to know what's going on.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:90%
We want to see this.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Did you discover
what it was, the blue earth?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: So as far as
that night, we created havoc,

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:54.930 align:middle line:84%
The general said, you just need
to know how dangerous this is.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.045 align:middle line:84%
And we're still
wondering if this

00:11:57.045 --> 00:11:58.170 align:middle line:90%
is right or wrong because--

00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It sounds
like Pandora's box.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah,
this is kind of crazy.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.490 align:middle line:84%
If somebody tells you something
and it gets this wild,

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.290 align:middle line:84%
you still go out and
check to make sure

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:10.720 align:middle line:90%
that somebody is not BSing you.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.955 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not trying to be rude to
people, but you need to know--

00:12:13.955 --> 00:12:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You have to go out and
see for yourself, I always say.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah,
the Dodge diesel

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.700 align:middle line:84%
pickup that I was
driving started,

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.880 align:middle line:84%
as we're going out
from Vernal to Lapoint,

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:84%
the pickup started ticking
like a bomb, and it was weird.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And Jeremiah Davis was talking
to us on the speakerphone.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.150 align:middle line:84%
He says, you stop the truck
right now and get out.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle line:84%
You guys don't know what
you're dealing with.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.250 align:middle line:84%
We was about five or
six miles out of Vernal

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.080 align:middle line:84%
going out to see what
the heck's going on.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.130 align:middle line:84%
The next thing you know,
I pulled the pickup over.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.890 align:middle line:84%
The two guys I was with,
Don Nicoloff and then Doug

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.260 align:middle line:90%
from Amarillo, they bailed out.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And he kept saying, you guys
don't realize what you've done.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.690 align:middle line:90%
I said, what we done.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:01.070 align:middle line:90%
You told us drill the hole.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: We're just kind
of boots on the ground.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, you need
to get back to town

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:14.760 align:middle line:84%
because you have created havoc
throughout upstairs, whatever

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.560 align:middle line:90%
that means.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did he ever
explain like what

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.680 align:middle line:84%
you'd done when you cracked
open the surface there?

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Well,
apparently, it had something

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.750 align:middle line:84%
to do with that blue
aura and the lightning

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.010 align:middle line:90%
strikes that were going on.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Like it gave it some kind of an
energy or released an energy.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's more to it
than that because we've

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.853 align:middle line:84%
seen a lot of things after
the fact in that area.

00:13:38.853 --> 00:13:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you just stop
there and get back in the truck

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.450 align:middle line:84%
and go back to town, or
did you listen to Jeremiah

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.390 align:middle line:84%
because he was telling you
didn't know what you did?

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever find out
why it was so terrible?

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: So what
took place there

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.440 align:middle line:84%
was after a little bit of
talking to Jeremiah Davis,

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.470 align:middle line:84%
we're standing out there
in the middle of a bargage,

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and I thought this
is even stupider.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And so finally I just
said, no, we still

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:06.930 align:middle line:90%
got to know what's going on.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.227 align:middle line:90%
So I went back to my pickup.

00:14:08.227 --> 00:14:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Did Doug and everyone--

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.790 align:middle line:90%
Doug jump back in the truck?

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Oh, hell no.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They said, no,
you're on your own there.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.710 align:middle line:90%
So I fired it back up.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:16.700 align:middle line:90%
It fired up.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:90%
Everything was fine.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.850 align:middle line:84%
I said, you guys,
get your ass in.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:21.102 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And what did you see?

00:14:21.102 --> 00:14:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: The next
thing you know, over there

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.710 align:middle line:84%
on the top of the
mountains where

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:26.270 align:middle line:84%
we were doing that
project, there

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.380 align:middle line:84%
was three craft that pulled
in, and they was like spheres.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:34.400 align:middle line:84%
They was just bright,
shiny looking things,

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and then three more and
three more pulled up.

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And what the deal was
is for whatever reason,

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:46.410 align:middle line:84%
they come in so hot that
they outran their fog.

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And so once they
would park, then they

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:53.340 align:middle line:84%
would just blow fog around
them and look like clouds.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.510 align:middle line:90%
But you know--

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How big
were these spheres?

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: You know, so I
get to cheat on this one.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.340 align:middle line:84%
So Jeremiah Davis
later on in his life,

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:06.240 align:middle line:84%
he would tell me they had 60
footers, 100 footers, 1,000

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.790 align:middle line:84%
footers, and then
the motherships were

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:13.380 align:middle line:84%
15 miles long, five miles wide,
and a mile deep out in space,

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:14.850 align:middle line:90%
and that's their base.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why were they so
interested in that spot

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:90%
that you were at?

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: So I just don't
know unless it was all about

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.963 align:middle line:84%
that the blue energy
and the lightning

00:15:24.963 --> 00:15:26.130 align:middle line:90%
strikes coming out of there.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And then people watch from
all over, even satellites,

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.260 align:middle line:84%
governments, the
whole nine yards.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:84%
You know that they know
they're watching everything.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So we have typically
two different phenomena.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:41.670 align:middle line:84%
One is that we have
these kind of light orbs

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:46.830 align:middle line:84%
and we have UAPs, which are
made of some solid metal.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Would you describe them
either as the light orbs

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:53.828 align:middle line:90%
or as a solid metal form?

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: It was solid.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.130 align:middle line:90%
They were solid.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:59.070 align:middle line:90%
They weren't like the orbs.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:01.530 align:middle line:90%
No, they was a solid piece of--

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.060 align:middle line:90%
it's like-- yeah.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Interesting.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So there's this
blue aura around this area.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:90%
There's blue lightning.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.710 align:middle line:84%
We have blue clay coming
out of the ground.

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:14.070 align:middle line:84%
All this blue energy seems
to be around this area

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.650 align:middle line:84%
that you're mentioning
with all these crafts.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.780 align:middle line:84%
I know, Tim, you
had some experience

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.310 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of blue energy.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:22.170 align:middle line:90%
What could you add to that?

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So I cannot tell if this
is the same thing that happens

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:33.120 align:middle line:84%
to you, but normally, if
we experience blue energy,

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.950 align:middle line:84%
then this could indicate that
we have a frequency shift,

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:43.950 align:middle line:84%
which means frequencies as
well as light, for example,

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:48.360 align:middle line:84%
or frequencies communicate
itself in different light

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.330 align:middle line:90%
phases.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:54.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you compress or enlarge
decompressed frequencies,

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:59.520 align:middle line:84%
then the light
that is irradiated

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.230 align:middle line:84%
shines or is
perceived differently.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.400 align:middle line:84%
So that could be, for
example, the reason

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.510 align:middle line:84%
why you see blue lights and blue
lightning strokes, for example.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I like what
you said about the reaction

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.010 align:middle line:84%
because here they are
digging into the ground,

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.700 align:middle line:90%
and this is the reaction.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So what could have happened
would be that if you,

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.420 align:middle line:84%
for example,
compress frequencies

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:28.349 align:middle line:84%
by digging into something, maybe
a chamber that has a higher

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:29.310 align:middle line:90%
compression or some--

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Pressure, right.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:30.928 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Pressure, right.

00:17:30.928 --> 00:17:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: That this could cause
a shift in frequencies.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Which is something
that even occurs naturally

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.120 align:middle line:84%
on the surface
level of the Earth.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So you have different
spots on the Earth

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:49.800 align:middle line:84%
that have these natural
occurring frequency shifts,

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.850 align:middle line:90%
but--

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.267 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah,
maybe we could even

00:17:52.267 --> 00:17:54.210 align:middle line:84%
say that this area is
one of those areas.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Potentially, yes.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That they cracked into,
and this release of pressure

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.128 align:middle line:84%
and the changing of
atoms and photons

00:18:02.128 --> 00:18:03.420 align:middle line:90%
affect the colors of the light.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: But have you
ever heard something?

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Has anyone told you
anything about--

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: No, not like that.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.183 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
time I've heard that.

00:18:11.183 --> 00:18:13.620 align:middle line:90%
That sounded good.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.850 align:middle line:84%
They never really told us why
things were going on like that.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.510 align:middle line:84%
They did tell us
that ever since that

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:26.850 align:middle line:84%
happened that the
upstairs group would

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.440 align:middle line:90%
be monitoring what's going on.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And there would be other
craft would come in,

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.390 align:middle line:84%
and they would sit
over that area,

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:37.710 align:middle line:84%
and they would do kind of
a vibration or something.

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And they could
recreate that blue,

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.420 align:middle line:84%
and then they would
drop down into it

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.280 align:middle line:84%
like it was, I don't know,
a filling station, I guess.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: But we have
all those reports on what

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.370 align:middle line:90%
took place there like that.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.310 align:middle line:90%
And so they monitored--

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.980 align:middle line:84%
the Federation monitored
that all the time.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.220 align:middle line:84%
They'd give me information
on dang near a daily basis

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:90%
on what's going on.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did you have
any other experiences

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:05.790 align:middle line:84%
after that that affected
you or that you actually

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:10.065 align:middle line:84%
had more communication
or visualized more craft?

00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Oh, wow.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.160 align:middle line:90%
So in turn, it's a game changer.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.780 align:middle line:84%
You start seeing
things so different.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle line:90%
It's unreal.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And so you start believing, even
though people won't believe.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:26.290 align:middle line:84%
One of the scenarios was that
my daughter was very sick

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and on her deathbed
in Amarillo, Texas.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And they put boots on the
ground to go into hospital,

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and they also put
one of those craft

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:43.410 align:middle line:84%
over the top of the hospital
to create a vibrational healing

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.840 align:middle line:90%
frequency over the top of it.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.680 align:middle line:90%
You just knew.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.390 align:middle line:90%
I was there for 29 nights.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:84%
You just knew that she
was not going to make it.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And with their help and then
good doctors helping too--

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.695 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are they the boots
on the ground, these beings?

00:19:58.695 --> 00:19:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yes, they were.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Did I get to see them?

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I never got to see them, but
if they tell you something,

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.370 align:middle line:84%
you just need to know
it's going to happen.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's just
their prewarning of here's

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.190 align:middle line:90%
what we can do.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:14.622 align:middle line:84%
And then you think, oh,
and then you think--

00:20:14.622 --> 00:20:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And your
daughter recovered?

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Yes,
she's doing fine now.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:18.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:19.715 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank God.

00:20:19.715 --> 00:20:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: The
only thing that I

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:25.050 align:middle line:84%
can say about who saw
them would be my daughter.

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, I don't
know how that really

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:84%
worked because there's a lot
of people in those hospitals.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:37.800 align:middle line:84%
But she would say that,
Dad, you just need to know--

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:84%
and she thought they
were Angels, you know,

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:43.560 align:middle line:90%
and this is what she would say.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.390 align:middle line:84%
To back up just a
little bit, where

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:84%
you or I have triglycerides
are like 300, 800 is deadly.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.440 align:middle line:90%
Hers was 13,000 plus or minus.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.240 align:middle line:90%
It was terrible.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Her whole body
was shutting down.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.460 align:middle line:90%
It was grease.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.420 align:middle line:90%
Everything was going on.

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And so the Federation
knew, because I was always

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:06.300 align:middle line:84%
in contact with them as far
as talking about things,

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and they just told me, they
put boots on the ground.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.620 align:middle line:84%
There were people, they're
so-called medical teams,

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and it's not medical
like what you would think

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.130 align:middle line:90%
or we would think.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:20.970 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a frequency
type scenario of healing.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.940 align:middle line:84%
It would be a competition on
who'd get to go in one night

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
and who got to go
in the next night.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was told that
by Jeremiah Davis,

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.180 align:middle line:84%
and then they
would put that ship

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.820 align:middle line:90%
over the top of that hospital.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:37.320 align:middle line:84%
He told me, he said, I'm
surprised as much healing

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.310 align:middle line:84%
frequency as we were bombarding
down on that hospital

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:44.190 align:middle line:84%
that everybody didn't
get up and walk out,

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.370 align:middle line:84%
but she's alive
and doing fine now.

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.920 align:middle line:90%
And there was no way.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:90%
There was no way.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.310 align:middle line:90%
She had tubes all over.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:middle line:90%
It was a sad, sad thing.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.850 align:middle line:84%
But for whatever
reason, they did

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:02.410 align:middle line:90%
that for her, did that for me.

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:05.082 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did your daughter
actually describe what she saw?

00:22:05.082 --> 00:22:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: The
only thing she knew

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:11.310 align:middle line:84%
is that any of those people
walking down the hallway,

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:15.000 align:middle line:84%
as they got closer to her,
she could feel like an energy

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:84%
or like a static or something
where all of her cells

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.900 align:middle line:90%
would just start buzzing.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And they would walk in
there, and there was always

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.730 align:middle line:84%
one particular one that
would walk in there,

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.570 align:middle line:84%
and as he got into her room, he
would kiss her on the forehead.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And the comical story
about that, my daughter,

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.720 align:middle line:84%
as she got better and
she's told me this story,

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.500 align:middle line:84%
she said, Dad, he's
pretty good looking too.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So you know, but
she's doing fine now.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But it was like those people had
an energy to them, even as they

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.710 align:middle line:84%
got closer to her, it was
just like her body just

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.150 align:middle line:90%
started buzzing.

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, would
you possibly say that

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.520 align:middle line:84%
through your experience that
these beings can actually

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.750 align:middle line:84%
come in through other
humans like ourselves

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:07.080 align:middle line:90%
and work energy through us?

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, there
are multiple ways

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:16.740 align:middle line:84%
how an ET or someone
from off planet

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.490 align:middle line:84%
could set their
boots on the ground.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:25.290 align:middle line:84%
This could happen
directly in a 3D form.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:33.030 align:middle line:84%
They could utilize a vessel
because some humans that we

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:38.130 align:middle line:84%
find here on Earth are actually
noninhabited so to speak,

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:39.810 align:middle line:90%
so that could be used.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:42.000 align:middle line:90%
But it also sounds--

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.600 align:middle line:84%
if you're talking about
Angels, we often make this

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.170 align:middle line:84%
or we hear this that
people experience

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:55.050 align:middle line:84%
an energetic form of presence,
so that could be true.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is
that people often

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:01.890 align:middle line:84%
interpret what they
see in the way what

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:03.670 align:middle line:90%
is comfortable to them.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:07.740 align:middle line:84%
So if someone, for example,
has a Christian background,

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.720 align:middle line:90%
they often see Angels.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.390 align:middle line:84%
While we have studies
in the Asian--

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: You know, so
people from over there

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.500 align:middle line:84%
see different other beings
or entities helping them.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So it could be an
energetic form.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Fascinating,
moving story,

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:30.200 align:middle line:84%
and I'm glad to hear that
your daughter is fine.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: After that
initial contact,

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Duane, were you contacted by
any three letter agencies?

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.790 align:middle line:90%
And if so, what happened?

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: We don't know
exactly where all the problems

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.700 align:middle line:84%
came from, but we
got shut down in

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.580 align:middle line:90%
several different directions.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:51.020 align:middle line:84%
In saying that, we pretty
well shut that project down.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In what ways
do they interfere?

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: We just caught
havoc from water boards.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And oh gosh, at one time,
we went to a meeting,

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:04.917 align:middle line:84%
and there was eight different
government agencies in there.

00:25:04.917 --> 00:25:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They didn't want you
doing anything over there,

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:08.480 align:middle line:90%
but that's your property.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And so we shut that project down
until basically Jeremiah Davis

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:17.030 align:middle line:84%
on his deathbed wanted the
story to be told that there's

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.430 align:middle line:84%
more out there than what the
governments or religions are

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.160 align:middle line:90%
telling us.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And I know this is crazy, but
it's called favor for favor

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.710 align:middle line:90%
in they healed my daughter.

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever on his deathbed
he wanted it to be told,

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.940 align:middle line:84%
then I put the ranch up
for sale for a big price

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.540 align:middle line:90%
because money brings intrigue.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:44.167 align:middle line:84%
And that's when Karga
Seven hunted me down for--

00:25:44.167 --> 00:25:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Who's that?

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Karga Seven
was a production company

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:52.090 align:middle line:84%
for Discovery, and they hunted
me down to tell my story,

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.820 align:middle line:90%
and so here we go.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we
fired her back up,

00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and now we're
catching havoc again.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you in
possession of anything

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:05.010 align:middle line:84%
that you would consider
extraterrestrial?

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: So not on that
project but on another project.

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:10.800 align:middle line:84%
That's right outside
of Amarillo, Texas

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.040 align:middle line:84%
that there's an element out
there that's not known to man.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: An element?

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is there
a name for it, or--

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.163 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: They had
to make up a name

00:26:19.163 --> 00:26:22.318 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
anything that we have.

00:26:22.318 --> 00:26:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is this the one
they talk about from Bob

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.478 align:middle line:90%
Lazar from Area 51?

00:26:26.478 --> 00:26:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Oh, I
don't on that deal.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:33.780 align:middle line:84%
I just know that this element by
the testing that the Federation

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:38.532 align:middle line:84%
did for me, it was like plus
or minus this element was--

00:26:38.532 --> 00:26:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where is
that element now?

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Who has it?

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: We got it,
and it's a bunch of it.

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.340 align:middle line:90%
It was like a downed spacecraft.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Please describe a
little bit for the audience

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.170 align:middle line:90%
what this element consists of.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.342 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:26:54.342 --> 00:26:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: The
only thing I can do

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.170 align:middle line:84%
is back up the report
of what we have.

00:26:59.170 --> 00:26:59.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's a--

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Is it a craft?

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.340 align:middle line:84%
You said there's
a part of a craft,

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:06.210 align:middle line:90%
or does it look like sand?

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Some of
it would be like sand.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Some of it's in crystal
form, and I just

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.050 align:middle line:84%
have to go off the report
that I have on that deal.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's where Don Nicoloff
was helping in Amarillo, Texas

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:21.090 align:middle line:84%
also, and then that's
where he got sick.

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Not from any of that, but where
I think he got zapped somehow.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how did you
discover this element

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.310 align:middle line:90%
and its characteristics?

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: So that's where
Don Nicoloff shows up again.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:36.510 align:middle line:84%
What these guys know and
how they come about things,

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:39.870 align:middle line:84%
I'll never know, but he
was tied to Jeremiah Davis.

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And I told him about a project
we had in Amarillo, Texas

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and we were a part
of, and I just

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.650 align:middle line:90%
wanted him to check it out.

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And so when they came
down to check it out,

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:53.040 align:middle line:84%
the Federation
basically, I have reports

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.480 align:middle line:90%
on how they go about it.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.950 align:middle line:90%
You show them where it he is.

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Because of what we
did for them up there,

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.510 align:middle line:84%
they would run tests
for me all over.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:03.300 align:middle line:90%
That's a pretty good gig there.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: So in
doing that, they

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.610 align:middle line:84%
would talk about
how whenever they

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:10.920 align:middle line:84%
test a project, like
if it's a mineral,

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:15.030 align:middle line:84%
they basically bring
their craft over.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Then they blow high pressure
air down into the ground,

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and then they catch
the particle dust,

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.480 align:middle line:84%
and then they take
samples of that dust.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Brilliant.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah, and that's
how they test all over,

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.320 align:middle line:90%
and I have reports of that.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, it came back that
the element that they found

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:39.120 align:middle line:84%
is not from Earth, and
it's like 110 light years

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.520 align:middle line:90%
away that this element exists.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's how those
people used to make,

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:48.370 align:middle line:84%
use that element to
build their ships.

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.940 align:middle line:84%
What in the report do
you remember, Duane,

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:90%
and what makes it so unique?

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Well, the
most unique thing about it

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:59.890 align:middle line:84%
was that they were telling
us how they go about testing

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:04.120 align:middle line:84%
everything and how
it all comes to them,

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and then they give me
100% of the element

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.270 align:middle line:90%
content in that material.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.070 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Which are not
found on Earth, right?

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.058 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Well,
some of them are,

00:29:12.058 --> 00:29:14.485 align:middle line:90%
because whenever you have--

00:29:14.485 --> 00:29:16.690 align:middle line:84%
it was a downed craft
is what he said.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So whenever that
hits, it's going

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:20.440 align:middle line:84%
to mix up with
other things, so you

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.200 align:middle line:90%
don't have just the same stuff.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So they showed me the
report of everything

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:32.540 align:middle line:84%
it was all the way down to the
element that's not from Earth.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.240 align:middle line:84%
But he always talked about
there are so many more elements

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.047 align:middle line:90%
in between our periodic table.

00:29:37.047 --> 00:29:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: It's unreal.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So when the craft hits
it, it gets destroyed.

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:47.720 align:middle line:84%
So theoretically,
it's just dirt,

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.170 align:middle line:84%
but that dirt is of
different elements.

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:54.650 align:middle line:84%
He even says in there
where part of the dirt

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:57.480 align:middle line:90%
will be known as a crystal.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.240 align:middle line:84%
But what gets weird
is, whenever it rains,

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.070 align:middle line:84%
when it rains out
there, I can go out

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.690 align:middle line:90%
to that project in Amarillo.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And when it rains, it will
wash those crystals off.

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And if I have the high
ground looking down at it,

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.750 align:middle line:84%
then I can see those crystals,
and I'll go down there

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:13.860 align:middle line:90%
and pick some up.

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Are they like glass?

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah, yeah.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It super heats
kind of like lightning

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.400 align:middle line:84%
when it strikes sand dunes
around the planet like gypsum,

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and it turns into a glass like
andara crystals they call them.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: Yeah.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So I can
see this happening

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:32.220 align:middle line:84%
where a super heated
craft or a lightning bolt

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:37.630 align:middle line:84%
or the energy from the craft
molded with whatever minerals

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:41.650 align:middle line:84%
was in the ground at that time,
kind of like fossilization

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:42.490 align:middle line:90%
over time.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:44.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's instant,
and that's where

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:46.990 align:middle line:84%
I think all these
crystals have come from.

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Duane, you have
nonterrestrial elements

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:53.200 align:middle line:84%
on a vast array of
your many properties.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.900 align:middle line:84%
How is this affecting
you, and what are you

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:57.890 align:middle line:90%
going to do with this?

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: We just need to
let humanity know that there's

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:04.130 align:middle line:84%
more out there than
what we're being

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:08.590 align:middle line:90%
told so we can advance farther.

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:11.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
all this goes.

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:13.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just don't
know, and I don't

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.510 align:middle line:84%
know how I've been blessed
to get to be a part of it.

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Duane, do you believe
you're tasked on some mission

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:23.560 align:middle line:84%
that they want you to do to
bring a craft to the surface?

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Well, I know
that we have reports

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.260 align:middle line:84%
on that there is a
craft up there in Utah

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:32.380 align:middle line:90%
buried about 150 foot deep.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And then, for
whatever reason, I've

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:39.310 align:middle line:84%
been told that from
Jeremiah, and then that's

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:42.520 align:middle line:84%
where all this crazy
stuff happens too.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.670 align:middle line:84%
So theoretically, you
get over that spot,

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:47.360 align:middle line:90%
equipment doesn't work.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.930 align:middle line:90%
Nothing really works.

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:54.010 align:middle line:84%
It jacks with your electronics
and the whole nine yards.

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:57.310 align:middle line:84%
What's crazy about it is
when you get over that--

00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:00.280 align:middle line:84%
people get over the
top of that that's

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.310 align:middle line:84%
had back pains for a
long time and everything,

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:07.160 align:middle line:84%
they get over that, then
their pain goes away.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.190 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:11.103 align:middle line:90%
This is crazy stuff.

00:32:11.103 --> 00:32:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you
going to continue

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:16.390 align:middle line:84%
to dig to hopefully find some
sort of exotic technology

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:17.800 align:middle line:90%
that can help humanity?

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: So we
have satellites

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.810 align:middle line:84%
that are telling us an
easier way to go about it,

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:27.740 align:middle line:84%
and there's tunnel systems
that have a reason for it.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And so the last
thing we want to do

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.970 align:middle line:84%
is to tear up something
that's been helping,

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:37.060 align:middle line:84%
but we would like to find
out a little more about it,

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and that's two
different scenarios.

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:43.660 align:middle line:84%
That's one in Amarillo,
Texas where that one's down,

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.750 align:middle line:84%
and it's just the material
content there that we know of.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And then also up
there in Utah where

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:53.380 align:middle line:84%
we've had different reports
of craft from people

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.760 align:middle line:90%
that don't know each other.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And that
one's underground.

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: And it's where Don
Nicoloff and the Federation

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.897 align:middle line:90%
told us where to dig.

00:33:01.897 --> 00:33:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know,
man, it's crazy.

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It is crazy, but
it's also fascinating.

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:12.210 align:middle line:84%
What is your takeaway
on this whole event?

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:18.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're blessed to be
part of this, and what's next?

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: You
know, I don't know.

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:22.500 align:middle line:84%
About the time you
give up, you think,

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.390 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is enough of
this, and they throw

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:26.400 align:middle line:90%
you another curve or another--

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.170 align:middle line:84%
and you think, oh, I've got
to go a little bit farther.

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:32.630 align:middle line:90%
So I think we're just being led.

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:35.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we can have
all the information at once,

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:38.130 align:middle line:84%
or we would put our
pillow over our head.

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:40.190 align:middle line:90%
So why now, Duane?

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.590 align:middle line:84%
You're coming forward,
you're giving us

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.750 align:middle line:90%
all this information and intel.

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:45.860 align:middle line:90%
What made you do it?

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: That's a simple one.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:52.400 align:middle line:84%
My biggest deal was that
my daughter's alive.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to see
Jeremiah Davis on his deathbed,

00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:02.400 align:middle line:90%
his whole deal was that I tell--

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.408 align:middle line:90%
>>OLLINGER: I tell the world.

00:34:04.408 --> 00:34:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And I owe him a favor,
and nothing will stop me.

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Even on the
documentary, they even

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.060 align:middle line:90%
asked me that same question.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And while they
were asking me that

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.050 align:middle line:84%
question, why would
you even do this.

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And about that time,
my daughter called me.

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if they wouldn't
have done what they've done,

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:27.949 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have got
this phone call.

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:31.489 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, it's definitely
a miraculous story you have,

00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:33.385 align:middle line:84%
and we're glad to
have you on the show.

00:34:33.385 --> 00:34:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: Thanks
for having me.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And Thank
you, Tim, also.

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:36.679 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:38.012 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: For being here as well.

00:34:38.012 --> 00:34:38.870 align:middle line:90%

this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

learned about extraterrestrials

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.230 align:middle line:90%
comes from the General.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Who is this general?

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>OLLINGER: He
worked for the CIA,

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and he was drafted
out of Area 51

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:01.920 align:middle line:84%
into the United Galactic
Federation of Hindon.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:06.390 align:middle line:84%
He talks about that there's
major crafts out in our galaxy,

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and there's good guys
and there's bad guys.
