00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic
Disclosure," we are with Tim,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.830 align:middle line:10%
a tactical advisor from Germany
who analyzes and suggests

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.220 align:middle line:10%
various strategies in relation
to extraterrestrial groups

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.840 align:middle line:10%
in contact with Earth.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.540 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us today
is Richard Doty,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.550 align:middle line:10%
a retired
counterintelligence agent

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.620 align:middle line:10%
who served in the
Air Force Office

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.240 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.980 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having us.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So, we're going to be
talking about what are

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.220 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial alliances
and factions here on Earth?

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I know that in 1947
there was a crash in Roswell,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and we recovered a live
extraterrestrial being.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.810 align:middle line:90%
He was named EBE1.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And he was in our
custody from 1947 to 1952

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.660 align:middle line:90%
when he passed away.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.480 align:middle line:84%
During that time
period, he gave us

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.440 align:middle line:84%
a vast amount of
information about his planet

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and about our planet
as they see it.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
goals that he had,

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.560 align:middle line:84%
and one of the
motivating factors

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.670 align:middle line:84%
he had to communicate with
us, is he wanted to go back.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.840 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to try to repair
his craft and go back.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And that set off a number of
projects within the government

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.090 align:middle line:90%
back in those days.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.650 align:middle line:90%
And, obviously, I wasn't there.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.130 align:middle line:90%
But I've read about it.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.530 align:middle line:84%
There's volumes and
volumes of documents--

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.410 align:middle line:84%
of projects that involved
the communications

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.830 align:middle line:84%
between the EBE1,
and his planet.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And when he died in
1952, he provided us

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.550 align:middle line:84%
with enough information
to be able to contact,

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.210 align:middle line:84%
through a communications process
that was highly classified,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.260 align:middle line:84%
with his home planet
in Zeta Reticuli.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, we
were able to communicate.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, we were able to
make contact with that planet.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And they came in 1964, the
Holloman Air Force Base

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.570 align:middle line:84%
landing, and they retrieved the
bodies of his fallen comrades

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.960 align:middle line:90%
and of EBE1.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.640 align:middle line:84%
So we were able to
establish contact back

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.210 align:middle line:90%
in the '50s and early '60s.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And we continued that on over
a period of right up until now,

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure, and I'm
sure that Tim can

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:90%
piggyback on that information.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Was there an EBE2?

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, there was an EBE2.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.400 align:middle line:84%
When EBE1 died, when the
aircraft landed at Holloman,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.660 align:middle line:84%
there was an agreement
that an EBE2 or an--

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Exchange?

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, an ambassador,
so to speak,

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.640 align:middle line:84%
would come to replace EBE1,
and we would then provide some

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.200 align:middle line:90%
astronauts to go back.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, the conjecture
is that did we

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.330 align:middle line:84%
provide a 12-man team,
this Project Serpo?

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.650 align:middle line:90%
We don't know about that.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Or whether it was
just three people?

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think, now, the
consensus is there was probably

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.720 align:middle line:84%
just three astronauts
that were sent back

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.550 align:middle line:84%
to the planet in the
Zeta Reticuli star group.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know how many of those
Ebens are actively on Earth?

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that
there are different

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Ebens still working with
different governments.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.190 align:middle line:90%
Do you know the actual number?

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>> As of the '90s, I
knew of two, EBE2--

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.640 align:middle line:90%
I knew an EBE3.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.320 align:middle line:90%
But-- and one--

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.540 align:middle line:90%
I believe EBE3 was the female.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.760 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know
any more than that.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:90%
There probably are more.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.095 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know of any more.

00:03:59.095 --> 00:04:02.210 align:middle line:84%
- Rick, you refer to
them as EBE1 and EBE2,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
but how do they actually
refer to themselves?

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they speak
in a language that--

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.950 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult
for us to understand,

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.090 align:middle line:84%
but there is a
designation they claim.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.779 align:middle line:84%
It's just a guttural
sound that our scientists

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.820 align:middle line:84%
and our translators
and linguists

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.100 align:middle line:90%
have translated over the years.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And, actually, we were able
to copy their language.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And some of us, some
of the linguists,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:84%
were able to actually
speak that language by--

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>> They could reproduce
that actual sound?

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>> They could produce
the guttural sounds.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.400 align:middle line:90%
And I can't make those sounds.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.290 align:middle line:84%
I would probably
embarrass myself

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and everyone else if
I made that sound.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.770 align:middle line:90%
But I heard the sound.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.370 align:middle line:90%
I heard these different sounds.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.640 align:middle line:90%
They sound very unique.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.860 align:middle line:90%
But, over the years, somehow--

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and maybe Tim can
explain to us how

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.810 align:middle line:84%
the Ebens were able to
communicate in English to us

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.190 align:middle line:90%
because they learned it.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.860 align:middle line:90%
It didn't take long for EBE1--

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.980 align:middle line:84%
because he was very
intelligent-- to learn English.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.097 align:middle line:84%
Our scientists, our doctors,
had to implant something

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:07.930 align:middle line:84%
in his throat, and I
don't know exactly what

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.610 align:middle line:84%
it was to enable him to make
the sounds that he would

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.290 align:middle line:90%
have to make to speak English.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.900 align:middle line:90%
But I understand EBE3--

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:84%
when she came here, she was
speaking almost fluent English.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be interested to know
if you know how they learned it,

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle line:84%
or what your
analysis of that is.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Ebens as a
biological life form,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.080 align:middle line:84%
they do have this language
Rick told us about.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And, as far as I'm aware, I
think they gave them books

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:84%
in order to prepare them
for the English language

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.010 align:middle line:90%
and other languages as well.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>> And the Greys--

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
they picked that up,

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:84%
but they have really
deep knowledge

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.970 align:middle line:84%
about German and pretty much
every other language as well.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And they have this factor
that all their consciousness

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:84%
units, which are basically
artificial life forms, they

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.850 align:middle line:84%
are connected to an
artificial information system

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:84%
where someone else is operating
and giving information.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can imagine as kind
of a download or something.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.460 align:middle line:90%
And they then can speak--

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.680 align:middle line:90%
well, in their artificial bod--

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.930 align:middle line:84%
puppet bodies, they are
not speaking German.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.650 align:middle line:84%
But they have this technology
in where they appear as humans.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And they then can use the
downloaded information

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.075 align:middle line:90%
in order to speak German.

00:06:37.075 --> 00:06:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that EBE1
gave us was the "Yellow Book."

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.000 align:middle line:90%
It was a gift to us.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's a history
of the universe.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And the ironic part
of this is, if you

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.620 align:middle line:84%
look at this "Yellow
Book," regardless

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.070 align:middle line:84%
of what your
nationality is, you're

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.340 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to
read this or hear it

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.970 align:middle line:90%
in your native language.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's German, Russian--

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:84%
I think-- I'm pretty sure
that the United States

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:84%
government tested this on a
lot of different languages,

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and you can actually
look and hear this.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we ask EBE1, how
can you-- how can this exist?

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.320 align:middle line:84%
EBE1 said-- explained
to us that it

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.250 align:middle line:84%
is so far advanced in
technology that he couldn't even

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.070 align:middle line:84%
possibly begin to explain
how the "Yellow Book" worked.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And so they had some sort
of linguistic ability.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I know they visited
Earth for a long time.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.480 align:middle line:84%
They were able to somehow
tap into every one of Earth's

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.410 align:middle line:90%
languages.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And I would be
fascinated to hear

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.367 align:middle line:90%
what you thought about that.

00:07:50.367 --> 00:07:51.167 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:51.167 --> 00:07:53.220 align:middle line:84%
So the Greys have the
same-- and I'm aware

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.790 align:middle line:84%
of a technology that
uses the consciousness

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:01.180 align:middle line:84%
field of source in order
to re-translate everything.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So, if one point of source
has this language evolved

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:84%
to something, they use that
technology and you see and hear

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.250 align:middle line:84%
someone speak in your
own language, which

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.180 align:middle line:84%
is a direct translation
from the consciousness

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.500 align:middle line:90%
of another person.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.390 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing
is that, for example,

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:23.970 align:middle line:90%
someone speaking Russian--

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.660 align:middle line:84%
he, for himself, he is
aware of speaking Russian

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and the acoustic signal that
is going out of his mouth

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:36.299 align:middle line:84%
is Russian, but when using
that technology, what comes

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.600 align:middle line:84%
to me as a recipient
of that language,

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.620 align:middle line:84%
it is acoustically
and physically German,

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.623 align:middle line:90%
and I hear that in German.

00:08:45.623 --> 00:08:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>> That's fascinating.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>> That's amazing.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That is truly amazing.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the things
I wanted to discuss is,

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.780 align:middle line:84%
because of the communications
that we established with

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.380 align:middle line:84%
EBE's planet and the
Zeta Reticuli star group,

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.520 align:middle line:84%
and then we received
the ambassador EBE2--

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:10.700 align:middle line:84%
EBE2 allowed us to project
ourselves to other planets.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:84%
EBE2 told us about a
number of planets that had

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.970 align:middle line:90%
visited Earth in the past and--

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.810 align:middle line:84%
because they were space
explorers, the Ebens.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And he facilitated connections
between our planet--

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and this is back in
the '60s and '70s--

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.260 align:middle line:90%
with these other ETs.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.660 align:middle line:90%
And he made sure--

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.250 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that
was very interesting--

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:84%
he reiterated that
he was only going

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:47.600 align:middle line:84%
to do this with the conditions
that we were not hostile to any

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.400 align:middle line:90%
of these planets.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.950 align:middle line:84%
They were different than
us, biologically different.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.870 align:middle line:90%
The technology was different.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.980 align:middle line:84%
But-- so he was able to
facilitate connections

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:57.865 align:middle line:90%
with other planets.

00:09:57.865 --> 00:09:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you know how many?

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know how many.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:05.320 align:middle line:84%
I-- the information that
I was briefed into just

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.910 align:middle line:84%
stated that he was able to
facilitate other planets,

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.260 align:middle line:84%
other civilization,
ET civilizations.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.600 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask Tim
that same question.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how many that
we've connected with?

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:22.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the number now
is in the thousands.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And it comes to the definition
of what a life form is.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Because at some
point we realized

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.660 align:middle line:84%
that in different realities,
in different versions,

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:84%
in different
dimensions, life forms

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:37.900 align:middle line:84%
exist that are
totally disconnected

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.820 align:middle line:84%
from every definition of
a biological 3D life form

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.380 align:middle line:90%
that we are aware of here.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.650 align:middle line:90%
So it's close to--

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:51.190 align:middle line:84%
possibly, it's close to
infinity, how many species

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.020 align:middle line:84%
and how many lifeforms
are out there.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>> How do the extraterrestrials
choose what governments or what

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle line:84%
individuals that they
want to make contact with;

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.285 align:middle line:90%
to speak with?

00:11:03.285 --> 00:11:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a concept that is
called cosmic correlationism,

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:13.070 align:middle line:84%
which means that something
that you know as something

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.530 align:middle line:90%
you're used to is some--

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.640 align:middle line:84%
determines the way
you approach someone.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So if there's a species that
has a very high authoritarian

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:28.040 align:middle line:84%
government system, they are
used to contact leaders;

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:35.690 align:middle line:84%
while if a species is pretty
much connected to heart,

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:40.520 align:middle line:84%
warmth, or feelings
and frequencies,

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.210 align:middle line:84%
and they will connect to
whatever individuals they are

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:45.800 align:middle line:90%
and not--

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.880 align:middle line:84%
unimportant of how
their education

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.570 align:middle line:90%
or position on whatever is.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and one thing I
wanted to ask Rick,

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:59.830 align:middle line:84%
are you aware of
species or humans

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.540 align:middle line:90%
living inside of planet Earth?

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Is there something--
because I've

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:09.700 align:middle line:84%
heard they were digging
holes, and they made contact

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:15.730 align:middle line:84%
to people inside of the pockets
of Earth, the Agarthan network,

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.120 align:middle line:90%
people inside of inner Earth?

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Subterranean-- I know of a
couple incidents where US Navy

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.220 align:middle line:84%
submarines had encountered
strange looking entities

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.070 align:middle line:84%
swimming in the water in a
number of different locations

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.440 align:middle line:90%
around Earth.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And there was a consensus--
and this was in the--

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.680 align:middle line:90%
this happened from the '60s on.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.990 align:middle line:84%
There's a former Navy
submarine commander

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.990 align:middle line:84%
who talked about this
at a UFO convention.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.260 align:middle line:84%
He gave a very,
very great lecture

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.860 align:middle line:84%
on what he experienced
during his--

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I think, 20 year or
whatever it was--

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:84%
submarine experience as
commander of a submarine.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And this was back in
the '70s and '80s,

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and I believe even into the
'90s, where they observed

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.440 align:middle line:90%
things coming out of the Earth.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how deep they were.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he ever
mentioned how deep.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.230 align:middle line:84%
But they were at-- in
one particular instance--

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:90%
and this was off Newfoundland.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And the sonar
identified something

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.880 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom, something big.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.112 align:middle line:84%
And so they went through
their battle stations.

00:13:28.112 --> 00:13:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And because they didn't
know what it was-- they

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.170 align:middle line:84%
thought it might have
been a-- this is back

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:37.540 align:middle line:84%
when the Soviets had submarines
penetrating US coastlines.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And they see this
entity, ET entity,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.660 align:middle line:84%
with a big, huge head,
almost like a praying mantis,

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.560 align:middle line:84%
but 25 to 30 feet
long, coming out.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, their first
impression was, this

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.590 align:middle line:84%
is some kind of an
octopus or some--

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>> --sea creature that
we don't know about.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:06.500 align:middle line:84%
But as it got closer to the
submarine, it had a face.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And it went-- and he
said-- not at the time,

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:14.210 align:middle line:84%
but later on, he figured
that this thing came up

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.360 align:middle line:90%
to the portals.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And he considered them
trying to communicate.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.780 align:middle line:84%
He didn't-- they didn't
think about it at the time.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.950 align:middle line:84%
But later on he said,
wow, this entity was

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.218 align:middle line:90%
trying to communicate with us.

00:14:26.218 --> 00:14:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>> So it was intelligent?

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>> It was intelligent.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And it swam around,
and then it went back

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:38.690 align:middle line:84%
in to the Earth's crust,
the bottom of the ocean.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And there's other-- the
Thresher that-- there

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:84%
was an incident, the Thresher
in 1964 that disappeared.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>> We lost it.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we lost it off
the North Carolina coast.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:56.330 align:middle line:84%
There was so much sonar
activity occurring before then,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:00.530 align:middle line:84%
that now that he mentions--
and I'm not saying this,

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:02.600 align:middle line:90%
but this Admiral mentioned--

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.700 align:middle line:84%
that he feels that
it was-- it had

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.665 align:middle line:84%
been attacked by something that
came out of the Earth's crust.

00:15:07.665 --> 00:15:09.665 align:middle line:84%
Now that's the only
information I have about it.

00:15:09.665 --> 00:15:12.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anything
factual that I've read

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:16.190 align:middle line:84%
or somebody told me about
during my time in that we

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.695 align:middle line:90%
had subterranean beings.

00:15:19.695 --> 00:15:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>> That's all I know.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I have definitely been
debriefed oh this on many

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:90%
occasions.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And we definitely
have huge pockets

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:84%
in the Earth that
has lots of life,

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:36.020 align:middle line:84%
bioluminescent, even
the atmos-- there's

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.740 align:middle line:84%
an atmosphere in these areas,
and they're very, very large.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And some of them do
have beings in them.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they do emerge
through either these portals

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:84%
in the Marianas Trench,
or into these aquifers,

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.180 align:middle line:84%
or through special cave
systems to the surface.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's very rare
because they don't

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.990 align:middle line:84%
want to contaminate
their atmospheric--

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>> --area, so they try to stay
away from being on the surface

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.930 align:middle line:84%
We also have special
drills that are very long

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and look like giant Anaconda
snakes, but in 3 feet

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.220 align:middle line:84%
in diameter that actually
melt through the crust.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And they have cameras on
them, and we have perforated

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.980 align:middle line:90%
many of these large areas.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a multitude
of these areas with--

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:26.985 align:middle line:90%
teeming with life.

00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:27.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:16:27.785 --> 00:16:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And it melts through the
rock and into these areas,

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.420 align:middle line:84%
and little probes are sent out
to look around and bring back

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.220 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.235 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, considering only
about 20% of the ocean has been

00:16:40.235 --> 00:16:41.035 align:middle line:90%
explored.

00:16:41.035 --> 00:16:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the things that I
knew about was some things that

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:50.580 align:middle line:84%
happened in the South Indian
Ocean, southwest of Australia.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of anomalies
that are occurring down there.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.890 align:middle line:84%
There's virtually no ship
trafficking down there.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And the only traffic is a boat
that might service some really

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.680 align:middle line:90%
remote islands.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.300 align:middle line:90%
Kerguelen Island is one of them.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Heard Island is another.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:11.349 align:middle line:84%
And, so, there are
scientists that

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:84%
feel that if there were going
to be subterranean beings,

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:20.560 align:middle line:84%
they would be in that
area because nobody

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:90%
explores it, number one.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.069 align:middle line:84%
There's no ship
traffic down there.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:25.750 align:middle line:90%
It's close to Antarctica.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And so they feel that-- and
all these anomalies that have

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.690 align:middle line:90%
occurred down there--

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.515 align:middle line:84%
the few ships that do
travel through their sea,

00:17:35.515 --> 00:17:39.880 align:middle line:84%
a number of UFOs flying,
UAPs flying in that area,

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.060 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of
underwater phenomena,

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.030 align:middle line:84%
of one particular ship
that serviced the Kerguelen

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Islands claimed it had been
tracked by this huge submarine,

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.450 align:middle line:84%
but there wasn't any
submarine in that area.

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:55.760 align:middle line:90%
There would be no reason to.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, a US Navy
submarine, 24 hours later,

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.230 align:middle line:84%
went down there and
tracked something

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.120 align:middle line:84%
that went towards
Antarctica, but then lost it.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:84%
So if there's life in the ocean,
I think there's scientists--

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.970 align:middle line:84%
and I actually
think that it would

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.325 align:middle line:84%
be down in that area
where nobody's looking.

00:18:16.325 --> 00:18:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm fascinated by that
because I've never been to any

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.750 align:middle line:90%
inside pocket of the Earth.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.540 align:middle line:84%
But communicating
with Being Six,

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:31.800 align:middle line:84%
they spoke about the alleged
story that at some point

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.630 align:middle line:84%
there had been some big
cataclysmic moment on Earth

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:40.340 align:middle line:84%
where some of the ancient
people decided to go underground

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and to continue
their life there.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And it might be
the reason why we

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:51.470 align:middle line:84%
find so many species on this
planet that suddenly disappear.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.480 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
South America, we

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.830 align:middle line:84%
have buildings and structures
for millions and millions

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.650 align:middle line:84%
of people, and they have never,
ever discovered anybody--

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>> No one.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>> --no skeleton at all.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.810 align:middle line:90%
They just, poof--

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Gone.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>> --gone.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of the stories
that this Being Six told me

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.080 align:middle line:90%
about the history of Earth.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.310 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really interested in
learning what's inside of it.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And also, allegedly, those
alliances, or those people,

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:24.770 align:middle line:84%
those parties, are in
contact with governments.

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:84%
At some point they became
aware that there are humans

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.950 align:middle line:90%
inside of Earth, populations.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to be in
contact about what's

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.440 align:middle line:84%
going on with Earth
in the future as well.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you name some more
of these extraterrestrial

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:90%
alliances?

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.745 align:middle line:90%
And how are they influencing us?

00:19:43.745 --> 00:19:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I will summarize that we
have two types of species,

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:52.730 align:middle line:84%
or beings, entities, whatever
you want to call them,

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:58.080 align:middle line:84%
that interact with humanity in
a direct or even a less direct

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:58.880 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.400 align:middle line:84%
You have, one, more
evolved beings,

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.840 align:middle line:84%
which means they are
higher in their frequency.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.430 align:middle line:90%
They have a different take.

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:84%
They might have come through a
three-dimensional experience,

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:17.180 align:middle line:84%
but now they ascended from
that, and they are reaching back

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.380 align:middle line:90%
in some way or another.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is that
we have 3D species outside

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.640 align:middle line:84%
of this planet who have,
in some way or another,

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:84%
an interest in either
protecting, or observing

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:36.535 align:middle line:84%
humanity, or sometimes
using advantages over them.

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Do we know which species
are there to help planet Earth

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.340 align:middle line:90%
and humankind?

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And those who maybe
don't want to help?

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.190 align:middle line:90%
Do you know which species--

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So if I put it in pictures,
I would say that the amount

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:58.850 align:middle line:84%
of beings that are benevolent
in some way or another are like

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:02.060 align:middle line:90%
pieces, like sand on beaches.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:06.560 align:middle line:84%
You have an enormous amount
of beings and definitions

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.620 align:middle line:84%
of entities or
something that are

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.370 align:middle line:84%
benevolent to the
process on Earth,

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:18.590 align:middle line:84%
like billions and
billions and billions.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:24.110 align:middle line:84%
The amount of 3D
body species that

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:30.410 align:middle line:84%
might be invasively
intermingling with the history

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:32.510 align:middle line:90%
of Earth and the system--

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:36.620 align:middle line:84%
that is a fairly quite
small number, I guess.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.800 align:middle line:84%
We're talking maybe
about some 100 species.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, Rick, there's got to
be some sort of documentation

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:50.300 align:middle line:84%
you've read of an agenda of
if there were an alliance

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:57.380 align:middle line:84%
to happen, or the meeting that
did happen, in White Sands.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:58.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, how'd that turn out?

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Did you get any
documentation if there

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:04.010 align:middle line:84%
was going to be a
positive alliance with any

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:04.970 align:middle line:90%
of those species?

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>> There was actually-- there
was obviously a very close

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:12.410 align:middle line:84%
alliance with the Ebens because
of the fact that they were very

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.480 align:middle line:84%
impressed with the way we
treated the injured one

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.280 align:middle line:90%
in the crash.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.650 align:middle line:90%
We didn't harm him.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:24.200 align:middle line:84%
We guarded the bodies of the
other one-- of his comrades.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to
effectively communicate

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:33.050 align:middle line:84%
using what EBE1 told us
and direct them to come

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:37.280 align:middle line:90%
back and recover the bodies.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So they were very
impressed with us.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
they offered, then,

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:45.600 align:middle line:84%
an agreement to exchange
ambassadors, so to speak.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>> So we sent--

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and it's still uncertain
whether we sent three or 12.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:90%
But we sent some people back--

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>> --some astronauts back.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And then they left EBE2
and then eventually EBE3.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And, as I understand,
they've had others,

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:02.810 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know that.

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:06.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as far as my
actions and my knowledge

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.270 align:middle line:84%
within the government,
I don't know that.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Outside I've heard a lot
of chatter about that there

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:13.670 align:middle line:90%
are others that have came here.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:17.420 align:middle line:84%
One particular meeting
occurred sometime in 2010

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:21.380 align:middle line:84%
on Johnston Island, which is
a very remote island, where

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:26.120 align:middle line:84%
the Vatican came and witnessed
the landing and exchange.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And these were Ebens
that I know of.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And there may have been
other ambassadors are coming.

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:32.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.460 align:middle line:90%
But I only know about the Ebens.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And they have, as I understand,
a very good relationship

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:39.710 align:middle line:90%
with our government.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure other
governments too,

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.140 align:middle line:84%
but I only know
about our government.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that President
Reagan was briefed on back

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:50.060 align:middle line:84%
in the '80s was about the
effective relationship

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:54.770 align:middle line:84%
that we had with this
ET force or ET race.

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.320 align:middle line:90%
And what he wanted to--

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.720 align:middle line:90%
form some kind of a treaty--

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.200 align:middle line:84%
is for them to assist
us in protecting Earth

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.650 align:middle line:90%
from the hostile ETs.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And we knew at that time that
there was one particular race

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:16.760 align:middle line:84%
of ETs that was hostile,
that their agenda on Earth

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:22.010 align:middle line:84%
was more or less for
their own well-being

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:24.200 align:middle line:84%
rather than the
Earth's well-being.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people will argue
that that doesn't necessarily

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.390 align:middle line:90%
mean they're hostile.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:31.310 align:middle line:84%
They just have their
own agenda that they

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:36.260 align:middle line:84%
want to satisfy on Earth,
and it's not necessarily

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.240 align:middle line:90%
going to harm the humans.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:42.380 align:middle line:84%
But one of their agendas that
we found out was abductions.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.933 align:middle line:90%
And we were hand-tied.

00:24:45.933 --> 00:24:47.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have worked
those things and--

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:48.560 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And these things-- these ETs
would come in, and we had no

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.610 align:middle line:90%
control.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:54.450 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't protect our people.

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
Reagan wanted to do was--

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:01.850 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to form alliances with
the friends, the friendly ones.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:06.215 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to help protect
Earth from the hostile.

00:25:06.215 --> 00:25:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know what species
that hostile one is?

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>> That was the
Reptilians, the Reptilians.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:17.045 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones that are
responsible for at least,

00:25:17.045 --> 00:25:24.711 align:middle line:84%
in the '80s, abductions,
and harmful activities,

00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:31.160 align:middle line:84%
and hostile acts against our
military ships, sunk a ship,

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.480 align:middle line:90%
shot down some planes.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>> How many incidences in total?

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, gosh.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:37.940 align:middle line:90%
I know of many.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the exact
number, probably more than 10,

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.190 align:middle line:90%
as far as hostile acts against--

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Abductions?

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.823 align:middle line:90%
>> --the government.

00:25:45.823 --> 00:25:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, as far as the abductions,
I don't know the exact number,

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:54.200 align:middle line:84%
but I would say probably
thousands of abductions.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Just a moment ago, you
mentioned Johnston island.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.910 align:middle line:90%
What exactly happened there?

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Johnston is located west
of the Hawaiian Islands.

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:10.360 align:middle line:84%
It was used as a chemical
storage location for the United

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.660 align:middle line:84%
States when we had a large
stockpile of chemical weapons.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:19.550 align:middle line:84%
It was also a location where we
disposed of chemical weapons.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:20.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a very small island.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.440 align:middle line:90%
It has an active runway.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.360 align:middle line:90%
It's very remote.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And we had facilities there that
tracked Soviet satellites back

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:35.420 align:middle line:84%
in those days, and I'm
sure we had the same.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.620 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that was ironic

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:84%
was the Vatican was notified of
this exchange of ambassadors.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.440 align:middle line:84%
When I was working at
this private laboratory,

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.330 align:middle line:90%
we were briefed into this.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:51.730 align:middle line:84%
We were provided
information about it.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And we had a particular
interest or object

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:56.590 align:middle line:90%
that the government wanted--

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.090 align:middle line:84%
objective that the
government wanted

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:02.200 align:middle line:84%
to do to facilitate
this exchange.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.130 align:middle line:90%
And we did this.

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Although I wasn't there,
some other people were there.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And somehow the
Vatican ambassador

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.470 align:middle line:84%
was notified of
this, and they wanted

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:18.970 align:middle line:84%
to send a representative
to the island to meet,

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.650 align:middle line:90%
and they did that.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, the real reason the
Vatican did this was, I believe,

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:31.530 align:middle line:84%
that they wanted to establish
some sort of contact

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:32.910 align:middle line:90%
with the ET race.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any other
knowledge of that other

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.620 align:middle line:90%
than what I'm telling you now.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So, Rick, what would you say
how important is the Vatican

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:48.315 align:middle line:84%
in this fractions and alliance
system that we're talking

00:27:48.315 --> 00:27:49.115 align:middle line:90%
about?

00:27:49.115 --> 00:27:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I-- we employed
some representatives,

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.810 align:middle line:84%
former representatives of the
Vatican of the Catholic Church,

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.780 align:middle line:90%
a monk and and a former priest.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:05.130 align:middle line:84%
The Vatican wanted to make
sure that any representation

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:10.560 align:middle line:84%
that we had with some ET
race outside this planet,

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.570 align:middle line:90%
that they were connected to it.

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
make sure that there

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:20.460 align:middle line:84%
was some kind of full
cooperation and non-hostile

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.630 align:middle line:90%
actions by our government.

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the really
important things

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.940 align:middle line:84%
that the Vatican wanted to
bring forth to our government--

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.490 align:middle line:84%
because we were a
government entity.

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:35.010 align:middle line:90%
We had a defense budget.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:38.280 align:middle line:84%
We were-- the Vatican sometimes
looked at the United States

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.560 align:middle line:90%
as being hostile itself.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted to make
sure that we were not

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:50.280 align:middle line:84%
going to act hostile towards
this particular entity

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.530 align:middle line:90%
that they were going to meet.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.090 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that was one.

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And some of this
is what I've read.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And some of it is
my own opinion,

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:01.200 align:middle line:84%
as far as I think the
Vatican wanted just

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.550 align:middle line:90%
to mediate the meeting.

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, did our
ambassadors return?

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:09.075 align:middle line:90%
And what did we learn?

00:29:09.075 --> 00:29:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a heck of
a story that's been going

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:17.610 align:middle line:84%
on since 2005 and
2006, the Serpo story.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was accused
of bringing this forth.

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:22.800 align:middle line:84%
It was somebody else
that-- they've since

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.990 align:middle line:90%
come forth and admitted to it.

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:26.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't think we really know.

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:28.710 align:middle line:84%
We know that some
of them came back.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:30.285 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether there
were 12 that went

00:29:30.285 --> 00:29:32.130 align:middle line:84%
or whether there
were only three--

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:37.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know the evidence that
Linda Moulton Howe presents is

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:39.330 align:middle line:90%
there's only three that went.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.190 align:middle line:84%
I know the evidence
that Victor Martinez

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:43.560 align:middle line:84%
and some of these other
people within the government--

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:47.550 align:middle line:84%
that Joseph Yeager,
who was intimately

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:51.150 align:middle line:84%
involved in this program,
spoke out at the UFO convention

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:54.060 align:middle line:84%
saying, I can tell
you the exact number,

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.380 align:middle line:90%
and I know what happened.

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.090 align:middle line:90%
He tells a whole story.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Bill Ryan tells
his story, others--

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:04.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you piecemeal
all this together,

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.540 align:middle line:84%
especially coming from Joseph
Yeager, who was DIA, I mean--

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>> --you know, that guy
is a proven DIA official.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.460 align:middle line:84%
There was some people-- and I
would just say some that went

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:19.740 align:middle line:84%
to the planet Serpo and lived
there for a number of years,

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:25.650 align:middle line:84%
10 to 15, came back to Earth
and provided a whirlwind,

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:29.790 align:middle line:84%
a plethora of information
about the planet, photographs,

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:36.490 align:middle line:84%
stories, plants, even
some animals that--

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:39.540 align:middle line:90%
and so we did learn something.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Where that information is
right now, it's hidden in DIA.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Why they won't even admit that
this has happened-- of course,

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:52.080 align:middle line:84%
when Yeager spoke, DIA totally
discredited him saying,

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.640 align:middle line:90%
no, it never happened.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Although he had other people,
including the one survivor who

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:02.400 align:middle line:84%
actually was able to
speak on a video feed--

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.800 align:middle line:90%
he was dying, actually.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.690 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems
that happened--

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Radiation?

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>> --to the-- yeah,
the crew that went,

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:13.260 align:middle line:84%
was a high level of radiation
that occurred on planet Serpo

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:16.650 align:middle line:84%
because it was a binary
planet, two suns.

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:19.980 align:middle line:84%
They were getting-- it
was almost 24 hour a day--

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.990 align:middle line:84%
I think it was like--
well, they didn't--

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:23.460 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't our 24 hours.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:26.100 align:middle line:84%
It was like 34
hours there a day.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And they got 30
hours of the sun,

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.140 align:middle line:84%
and the radiation affected
every one of them,

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:34.530 align:middle line:84%
the number of ones that
went and came back.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:37.222 align:middle line:84%
Some supposedly stayed
according to the DIA.

00:31:37.222 --> 00:31:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Three of them, I heard,
volunteered to stay.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.420 align:middle line:84%
They volunteered to
stay on the planet.

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And we-- I don't know what
their outcome is as of today.

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:48.865 align:middle line:90%
But that's the story.

00:31:48.865 --> 00:31:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Tim, where do you see
the future going with these

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:56.435 align:middle line:90%
alliances?

00:31:56.435 --> 00:32:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So, I think that at the
present time a lot of patterns

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.640 align:middle line:90%
have not been solved.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Earth people are
experiencing a very

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:11.240 align:middle line:84%
distorted and
non-efficient system

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:19.940 align:middle line:84%
that is ruling over the Earth
in a very non-homogeneous way.

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like things will be
more effective in the future.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Also, the awareness that we
are all connected, and having

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:35.990 align:middle line:84%
those other alliances,
and other beings

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:41.810 align:middle line:84%
that are helpful and reach back
to us and spread information,

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:46.040 align:middle line:84%
are giving even hands-on
advice or something.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:50.280 align:middle line:84%
That is very assuring
and very positive.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And also needs--
because we were talking

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.370 align:middle line:84%
about systematic
alliances on Earth,

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:59.540 align:middle line:84%
and there are-- we also need
to take into consideration

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:04.700 align:middle line:84%
that everyone, every single one
on Earth and in the universe,

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.520 align:middle line:84%
has their own mission
and responsibility

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.810 align:middle line:84%
to commit themselves to
the benevolent exploration

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:14.510 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, and
that's happening.

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:18.500 align:middle line:84%
There are lots and lots of
individual very ascended

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:23.630 align:middle line:84%
characters, beings,
fractions, federations.

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:26.180 align:middle line:84%
They all are
reaching to everyone

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and giving their hands,
and I feel that it's

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.290 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful message from them.

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:32.915 align:middle line:84%
>> It is very beautiful, and I'm
looking forward to the future.

00:33:32.915 --> 00:33:33.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:33.715 --> 00:33:36.605 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, gentlemen, thank you
so much for being on the show.

00:33:36.605 --> 00:33:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.435 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, Emery,
it's been my pleasure.

00:33:40.435 --> 00:33:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:46.010 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:48.900 align:middle line:84%

you put into your language

the more powerful
the language becomes.

00:33:57.735 --> 00:34:03.720 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, someone or
something made people on Earth

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:07.500 align:middle line:84%
use a modified version
of their own language.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.190 align:middle line:84%
The installation and the
modification of languages

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:15.060 align:middle line:84%
has never, ever been
so weak, like it's now.

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Because people do not
mean what they speak.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:19.499 align:middle line:90%
They just put out words.
