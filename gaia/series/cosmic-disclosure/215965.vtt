>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.650 align:middle line:10%
we are joined by Victoria
Whitney, a doctor of science

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.450 align:middle line:10%
and a retired member
of the Department

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.380 align:middle line:10%
of Defense, United States Navy.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are discussing
how ET contacts see us.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Victoria, welcome
to the show again.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.458 align:middle line:84%
>>VICTORIA WHITNEY:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So why do
extraterrestrials

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.990 align:middle line:90%
refer to us as Terrans?

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, we associate
them with geographic location.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.630 align:middle line:90%
So Pleiadians from the Pleiades.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.520 align:middle line:84%
They don't call
themselves Pleiadians.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And actually, if
they looked at us

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:84%
from where we're
positioned in the cosmos,

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:84%
they would be calling us
something like Monaserrans.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:84%
But instead, what they
do is call us Terrans.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.240 align:middle line:84%
So when they refer
to us all the time,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.130 align:middle line:84%
instead of saying humans,
for the most part,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.480 align:middle line:90%
they'll call us Terrans.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that's
centuries old for them,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.510 align:middle line:84%
when they use this
as a way station.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And so they would call it
the Terran way station.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And just talked about the humans
that actually lived on it.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:90%
Then we became Terrans.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.620 align:middle line:84%
So we never stuck
with that, though.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.685 align:middle line:84%
We don't call ourselves
Earthers, right?

00:01:26.685 --> 00:01:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: And we don't
call ourselves Terrans.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's their way, though,
of disseminating between where

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:90%
species are coming from.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And so if you say a Terran,
usually what they'll think

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.950 align:middle line:90%
is Earth.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll think
of Alpha Centauri

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.430 align:middle line:84%
because they call
themselves Terrans.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's because they consider
themselves actual humans,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.200 align:middle line:90%
like we are.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I found it
interesting because they

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.400 align:middle line:90%
would refer to us as Terrans.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.858 align:middle line:84%
And for a while
there, it took me--

00:01:54.858 --> 00:01:58.210 align:middle line:84%
my brain has to get
assimilated with--

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's a large group.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Exactly.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's not just us here.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Exactly.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And then, because
we-- we're humans.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.229 align:middle line:84%
And so that's an easier
concept for us to follow.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:84%
So like I say, when they first
started calling us Terrans,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.200 align:middle line:84%
it took me a while to,
oh, you're talking to me.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's
actually more specific

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.180 align:middle line:84%
because of where
we're at in space.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And so like I say,
for them, that's

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.990 align:middle line:84%
a way of classifying
the species.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And so, like Pleiadians,
when we were talking to them

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.570 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning, of course,
we don't know any better.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.280 align:middle line:90%
I just said Pleiadians.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.860 align:middle line:90%
And then he corrected me.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.200 align:middle line:90%
Zendor said, no, I'm a Uronian.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: An Uronian?

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yes.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
what does that mean?

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And so then he
started explaining,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.730 align:middle line:84%
well, you call us Pleiadeans
because of where we're located.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
we call ourselves.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very much
a learning curve.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be doing
that from now until who

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.142 align:middle line:84%
knows when of trying to learn
their actual species names.

00:02:51.142 --> 00:02:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are the
equitable laws of the universe?

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.680 align:middle line:90%
And why are they important?

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So they call
them equitable laws.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:90%
We call them universal laws.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.660 align:middle line:90%
They're the same thing.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:84%
They believe that they were
handed down from source

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.070 align:middle line:84%
so that we could understand
the creative process of things.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.920 align:middle line:84%
It says that it must be
creative and then comprehended

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.410 align:middle line:84%
in order for it to
exist and the laws

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.670 align:middle line:84%
are the thing that
allow that to happen.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.070 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it allows
something to be created.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.050 align:middle line:90%
It allows us to comprehend it.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And under that
comprehension, then there's

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:84%
certain laws that
apply in which we

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:90%
should enact within our lives.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So those laws are
very broad across

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.480 align:middle line:90%
many different categories.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But you mentioned
source, Victoria.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.690 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.315 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So they
believe that there's

00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:37.640 align:middle line:84%
an intelligent energy that
they call the universal source.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And that intelligent
energy became self-aware.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's what started
the creative process.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.460 align:middle line:84%
So they believe that originally
there was nothing here.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And then when this intelligent
energy became aware of itself,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.480 align:middle line:90%
it created the first universe.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And they believe that that's
how they came into existence.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And looking at
what we've seen, I

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.750 align:middle line:84%
think that that's a very
plausible way to look at things,

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
whether you call
it magic or energy

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.930 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the case may be.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.830 align:middle line:84%
But this universal
source is very much

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.250 align:middle line:90%
a part of who they are.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:84%
They believe that there is
no such thing as other gods.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.082 align:middle line:84%
They say that's
extraterrestrials

00:04:16.082 --> 00:04:17.290 align:middle line:90%
that are just playing a part.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.740 align:middle line:90%
And we just name them that.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.260 align:middle line:84%
What they believe is
this intelligent energy,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.740 align:middle line:84%
because it became
self-aware, is really

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.170 align:middle line:84%
what is proliferating
in the cosmos.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And they'll point to a
nebula and say, look,

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.130 align:middle line:84%
there's a new creation
happening right there.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.990 align:middle line:90%
And very much, we witness it.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Beautiful.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How do they define
consciousness and its role

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.800 align:middle line:90%
in the universe?

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah, so
these universal laws,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.450 align:middle line:84%
because they're part of
that creative process,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.100 align:middle line:90%
we are created as well.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And so we should be
following those laws.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And they say, if we
just follow the laws,

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.020 align:middle line:84%
we don't need any other laws
because it would prevent us

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:84%
from doing things that
are harmful to each other.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So they do cover a
wide variety of things.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.990 align:middle line:84%
It talks about abundance
and manifestation.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And the Law of One
is included in that

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.478 align:middle line:84%
and the law of catastrophe,
the law of free will.

00:05:07.478 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it just goes on and on.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.000 align:middle line:90%
There's 42 of them.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.120 align:middle line:84%
But if we lived by
those, we would be

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.070 align:middle line:90%
living higher conscious lives.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's really important
for them to be aware of that.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.347 align:middle line:84%
So that's applied in
everything that they do.

00:05:20.347 --> 00:05:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Besides the
Book of the Law of One,

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.805 align:middle line:84%
which you just
mentioned here on Earth,

00:05:23.805 --> 00:05:25.980 align:middle line:84%
are there other books
where a lot of this stuff

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.243 align:middle line:90%
has transcended down into?

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah, they
have the thing that they

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.800 align:middle line:90%
call the 105 cosmic laws.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:84%
That's applicable to
the third dimension.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.720 align:middle line:84%
So they tell us
that every dimension

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.960 align:middle line:84%
has a different set of cosmic
laws because of the properties

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.395 align:middle line:90%
of the dimension.

00:05:41.395 --> 00:05:42.520 align:middle line:90%
And that makes total sense.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.490 align:middle line:90%
So we have 105 here.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.380 align:middle line:90%
And just covers--

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I couldn't even
begin to relay all of them.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.390 align:middle line:84%
We see them
frequently happening.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, they're put there
to control the parameters

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:90%
for the dimension itself.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
solid dimension.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to have a
lot more laws to equate

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.037 align:middle line:84%
to that solidifying
factor of what's

00:06:06.037 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:90%
happening in this mission.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.600 align:middle line:84%
If we go to another dimension,
we go to the fifth dimension,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.030 align:middle line:84%
it's very much a
light body dimension.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.970 align:middle line:84%
It has a different
set of laws there.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that they've

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.110 align:middle line:84%
tried to make sure
that we understand,

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.260 align:middle line:84%
that just because it says
there's the 105 laws,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.400 align:middle line:90%
that's only applicable to here.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.915 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't apply to
the other dimensions.

00:06:26.915 --> 00:06:28.960 align:middle line:84%
So we would have to
learn what those are.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are these
laws spiritual

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.800 align:middle line:84%
or scientific,
like with physics?

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: The 105 cosmic
laws are meant to affect both.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.780 align:middle line:90%
So really, do we have physics?

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, only as far as
we can comprehend.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.630 align:middle line:84%
If you ask them, they say
physics doesn't really apply.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.708 align:middle line:84%
But the laws themselves set
up the properties for that

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:49.750 align:middle line:84%
so that we have an
understanding of what that is.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.167 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, it's
going to affect

00:06:51.167 --> 00:06:52.530 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual aspect of it.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:84%
What are the properties of
being a spiritual person?

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And so those laws are
meant to affect that,

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.790 align:middle line:84%
to give us guidelines,
so to speak,

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.113 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that we're living
within the confines of that.

00:07:03.113 --> 00:07:05.280 align:middle line:84%
What happens when we go out
of the confines of that?

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, things fall apart.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And so these 105 cosmic
laws were put into place

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.230 align:middle line:84%
specifically for
the third dimension

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.497 align:middle line:90%
to affect those things.

00:07:13.497 --> 00:07:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you give us
an example of a few of these?

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: In our own context,
here we go, thou shalt not kill.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.610 align:middle line:84%
But under the 105
cosmic laws, there's

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.230 align:middle line:90%
a specific law that values life.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And in stating that
it's valuing life,

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.420 align:middle line:84%
we would not assume
that you would

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.910 align:middle line:84%
take a life because that's not
the way the law is laid out.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.900 align:middle line:84%
So once you start following
the context of what the law is

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.640 align:middle line:84%
trying to lay out,
you realize that it's

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:43.530 align:middle line:84%
sort of a whole cycle of how
an entity is brought forth,

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.640 align:middle line:84%
constructed, lived its life,
evolved, and then ascends.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's the whole
purpose of the laws,

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.060 align:middle line:84%
is to give us those guidelines
of how that happens.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.850 align:middle line:84%
So now, we didn't
come in with a book

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.190 align:middle line:84%
when we were born that said,
here's how it's going to work.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.590 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, if we
had been cognizant of them

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.180 align:middle line:84%
all along, we would have
had those laws up front.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.090 align:middle line:84%
But they've been lost
through our history.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.180 align:middle line:84%
They've told us,
you've lost everything.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.156 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask him,
well, who lost it?

00:08:13.156 --> 00:08:13.956 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:08:13.956 --> 00:08:14.763 align:middle line:90%
Where did it go?

00:08:14.763 --> 00:08:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Right,
where did it go?

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.733 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did it get
buried somewhere?

00:08:17.733 --> 00:08:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: It's probably
sitting in some vault

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:90%
somewhere, for all we know.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.220 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that they
say if you were aware of this,

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:84%
you would have had
more understanding

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.400 align:middle line:84%
outside of the planet
of what's happening

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and more understanding of what's
happening on our planet itself.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.860 align:middle line:84%
So these laws become
very important to us.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're coming
through them now.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember all of them.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have a hard
time remembering 10.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.419 align:middle line:90%
So 105 is going to be a lot.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:44.850 align:middle line:84%
But what they're
trying to say is

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.100 align:middle line:84%
that once we learn
these laws, we'll

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.080 align:middle line:90%
understand how things work.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And we'll have a
better understanding

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.675 align:middle line:90%
of where the planet's going.

00:08:52.675 --> 00:08:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How did they
compare nonhuman intelligence

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.070 align:middle line:90%
with their own intelligence?

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So we're
not very intelligent.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.700 align:middle line:90%
I know we think we are.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.660 align:middle line:90%
But we're not.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.240 align:middle line:84%
If you spend 10 minutes
with one of them,

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.000 align:middle line:84%
you're going to realize that
you are not on the same scale.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.100 align:middle line:90%
But what's intelligence?

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've asked
us that question before.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Do we understand the
definition of intelligence?

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I can go to the
dictionary and look it up, yes.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:84%
But that's not how they
define intelligence.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.442 align:middle line:90%
And so some of them--

00:09:21.442 --> 00:09:23.150 align:middle line:84%
I've talked about the
Andromedans feeling

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.500 align:middle line:84%
like they have a
superiority over us.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:84%
But you have to remember that
a lot of their intelligence

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.140 align:middle line:90%
is programmed into them.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So they're given aspects
that we clearly have not even

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.370 align:middle line:90%
defined yet.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And really, is that the
summation of what intelligence

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:38.630 align:middle line:90%
is?

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.170 align:middle line:90%
That would be hard to say.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:84%
But they are very much
more intelligent than us

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.560 align:middle line:84%
because they've been exposed
to more, because they've

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.740 align:middle line:84%
seen other processes,
because they understand it

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle line:84%
from a totally different
aspect than we possibly can.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can't
even explain half

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.370 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening on this
planet most of the time.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to equate
intelligence to that,

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.240 align:middle line:84%
yes, they are going to be far
more intelligent than we are.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.350 align:middle line:84%
But then if we
define intelligence

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:12.610 align:middle line:84%
as the ability to
perceive something

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and conclude it as
being something,

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:84%
then I think that
we're well on our way

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.910 align:middle line:84%
to that because our
observations are very

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.220 align:middle line:90%
good about what we observe.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.570 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that we
understand what's happening.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.563 align:middle line:84%
But it means that
our observations.

00:10:28.563 --> 00:10:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's really-- remember,
we talk about creation

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:31.910 align:middle line:90%
and comprehension.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.697 align:middle line:84%
That comprehension piece
is so important for us.

00:10:34.697 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Like you
said earlier, that's

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:84%
where the knowledge comes
in because with all that.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Exactly.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.850 align:middle line:84%
When we can comprehend it,
we can make so much better

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.473 align:middle line:84%
use of how it's going
to affect our life

00:10:45.473 --> 00:10:46.640 align:middle line:90%
and where we're going to go.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.310 align:middle line:84%
So intelligence is
relative to the species

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.720 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking to.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:84%
What I found
interesting is they were

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.500 align:middle line:84%
willing to continue
to converse with us.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
Zendor said to me,

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.870 align:middle line:84%
you have far more intelligence
than we gave you credit for.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.380 align:middle line:90%
That's a wonderful thing.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure exactly
what scale that's on yet.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.550 align:middle line:84%
But I would rather
have them recognize

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:15.963 align:middle line:84%
that about us than to
say, I wasted my time.

00:11:15.963 --> 00:11:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, they're
talking to you specifically--

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: To me specifically.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: --or to the human race?

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Because I
would make observations.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.650 align:middle line:84%
They're doing a lot of science
while they're doing it.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And we help them
with their project.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I have
a science background.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.080 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to
understand a lot

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.650 align:middle line:90%
of what they were trying to do.

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And so they gave us credit
as a species because we

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.050 align:middle line:90%
have far more intelligence.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a
wonderful thing, is

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.833 align:middle line:90%
to we fooled them, so to speak.

00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How do
they differentiate

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:84%
between mindful and
mindless humans?

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Oh, yeah,
that's a huge one.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.812 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What's the difference?

00:11:50.812 --> 00:11:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So we talk about
this all the time in our group.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:84%
People get behind a
vehicle that is dangerous,

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.685 align:middle line:90%
can do a lot of damage.

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they will not
be mindful of a red

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:90%
light or mindful of a stop sign.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.250 align:middle line:84%
They'll just drive right
through it or whatever.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's that loss--

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:13.695 align:middle line:84%
they look at it and say it's
a loss of conscious awareness.

00:12:13.695 --> 00:12:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I like that.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you're mindless, you have
this loss of conscious awareness

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:19.940 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.630 align:middle line:84%
People that are awakening
are more mindful

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.550 align:middle line:84%
because that
conscious awareness is

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.930 align:middle line:84%
at the forefront of everything
that they're seeing.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes very much a
parameter for them to look at.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And they say to us, your
mindfulness is only at 0.002%

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.490 align:middle line:84%
across your population,
which is nothing.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And so they say you need to
wake up to become more mindful.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you will
begin to transcend

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.810 align:middle line:90%
into that mindless realm.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And like I say, we
begin to look at it

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.390 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, we can
witness that happening.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what do they
tell you about, let's say,

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:59.650 align:middle line:84%
the whole sphere of
the planet Earth,

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.290 align:middle line:84%
of mindful people
and mindless people?

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Is the mindful people going
to take over that energy?

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, here's
an interesting way

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.770 align:middle line:90%
in which they look at it.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:84%
They said if we suddenly
had a huge awareness

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and half of the planet
woke up and that

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:21.580 align:middle line:84%
increased the intensity of
the frequency of the planet,

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:26.100 align:middle line:84%
that we would just move this
planet into a whole new era

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.370 align:middle line:84%
of what it's supposed to be
a much more mindful planet.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.110 align:middle line:84%
But they said that's
not going to happen

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.190 align:middle line:84%
because what happens is
those frequencies, even

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.350 align:middle line:84%
though a higher frequency will
take over a lower frequency,

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:42.270 align:middle line:84%
there isn't a high
enough or collectively

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.890 align:middle line:84%
a large enough
bandwidth of that.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's envision that
all of this energetic

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.650 align:middle line:84%
influences in a much higher,
bigger realm of things.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So we'll talk about
a matrix of energy.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And so every thought,
every word, every deed

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.360 align:middle line:84%
influences that
energetic matrix.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, the
mindless, everything

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:84%
they think, act,
do, and say are also

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.550 align:middle line:84%
being an influence in
that energetic matrix.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:15.340 align:middle line:84%
So how do you calculate
the balance of that?

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Because we're talking
about not just our species.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.910 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about every
species in the universe

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:21.790 align:middle line:90%
affecting that.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.255 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And the planets too.

00:14:23.255 --> 00:14:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: All the
planets, everything,

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.260 align:middle line:90%
everything that's energetic.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And since everything is energy,
it's all affecting this matrix.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And so it would be really hard
to say that one influence is

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.530 align:middle line:84%
outweighing another
influence because they're

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:43.210 align:middle line:90%
in the matrix of energy.

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:46.060 align:middle line:84%
There's no way to
calculate what that is.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the
normal way energy works.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.680 align:middle line:90%
It's always seeking equilibrium.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.960 align:middle line:90%
It's always seeking a balance.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you have two entities
that are opposed, somewhere

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:90%
in between, there is a balance.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.077 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make either
one right or wrong.

00:15:02.077 --> 00:15:03.910 align:middle line:84%
There's just a balance
somewhere in between.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.030 align:middle line:84%
So on a grander scale, that's
what the universe is doing,

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:08.800 align:middle line:84%
is it's seeking that
balance and things.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.560 align:middle line:84%
So are we going to see
one outweigh the other?

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would be hard to
calculate because now we're

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.890 align:middle line:84%
talking, what's going to
outweigh an entire planet?

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Another planet the
same size over here?

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:21.220 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work that way.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.743 align:middle line:84%
So we would have a real hard
time of understanding that.

00:15:24.743 --> 00:15:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And they look at it and
say-- that's why they always

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.860 align:middle line:84%
come back and say, you need
to learn to be balanced.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.220 align:middle line:84%
You need to find the
centeredness of everything.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.925 align:middle line:90%
It's merely an energy.

00:15:35.925 --> 00:15:39.050 align:middle line:84%
But how much energy are
we putting into something?

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what we
see on the planet right now,

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:45.780 align:middle line:84%
is that we have certain energies
that are driving things.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.760 align:middle line:90%
And so they're very apparent.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.030 align:middle line:84%
We have good energies that are
trying to drive things as well.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:84%
But when we look at
the number of energies

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.290 align:middle line:84%
that are driving something
vice the number of energies

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.030 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to correct
that, there's no balance there.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.613 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Which is
constantly changing.

00:16:01.613 --> 00:16:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Right,
exactly, exactly.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And so it isn't
easy to say that one

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:08.060 align:middle line:84%
will outweigh the other
because that's not

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.768 align:middle line:90%
the way that energies work.

00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:11.935 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for the
equilibrium and the balance.

00:16:11.935 --> 00:16:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:12.800 align:middle line:90%
That's a great definition.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.635 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: And that means--

00:16:13.635 --> 00:16:14.435 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:16:14.435 --> 00:16:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And whatever's inputting that
has to have that understanding.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What is their
opinion on Earth's systems

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.750 align:middle line:84%
of government and
their leadership?

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, they don't find
our governments very impressive.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.705 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I wouldn't think so.

00:16:29.705 --> 00:16:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: And
honestly, they've said

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.200 align:middle line:84%
throughout the course
of our history,

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.170 align:middle line:84%
they've interacted with
different governments

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:35.970 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:37.965 align:middle line:84%
So they have an understanding
of what that is.

00:16:37.965 --> 00:16:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was funny
because we were having

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.780 align:middle line:90%
a conversation about democracy.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And they said, that's
a terrible word.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.392 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, we use
it as an explanation.

00:16:47.392 --> 00:16:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And they said, it's
still a terrible word

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.612 align:middle line:90%
because it's a fallacy.

00:16:51.612 --> 00:16:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And they said
governments are going

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.165 align:middle line:84%
to do what governments do based
on their own private agendas.

00:16:57.165 --> 00:16:58.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a true statement.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.300 align:middle line:90%
I can agree with that any day.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:04.310 align:middle line:84%
I said, what we're hoping is
that our form of government

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.119 align:middle line:84%
would be of the
people, by the people

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.220 align:middle line:84%
because we have a sheet
of paper that says that.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: And they
just shake their head.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And they said, but you
don't operate that way.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And they say, here's the
problem with government.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.470 align:middle line:90%
It's exploitive.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.079 align:middle line:84%
That's a huge word, that
it exploits its own people.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:25.079 align:middle line:84%
So what you say to them--
well, what do you mean by that?

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well, you
traffic human beings.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.520 align:middle line:90%
That's a true statement.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.414 align:middle line:90%
I can't argue that one.

00:17:34.414 --> 00:17:38.470 align:middle line:84%
You make more money
off of guns and drugs

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.790 align:middle line:84%
than you do anything
else on the planet.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And they say that's your
government representatives.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And I know that if I were
to say that to our senators,

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.980 align:middle line:90%
they would deny it.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.720 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is is we're
talking about the system.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.120 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
about the individual.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
way that they view us,

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.240 align:middle line:84%
is that our governments
are not working

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:90%
for the benefit of the planet.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:07.220 align:middle line:84%
They're working for certain
agendas, for certain--

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.750 align:middle line:90%
they call them elites.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:11.860 align:middle line:84%
They're very forward
thinking about how they

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.730 align:middle line:90%
view the structure of things.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And they say they're working
for the agenda of the elites.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And those elites are
dealing with other entities

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:21.625 align:middle line:90%
that are not from here.

00:18:21.625 --> 00:18:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I agree with that.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:23.875 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right, I do too.

00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And so it's sort
of disheartening

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:30.490 align:middle line:84%
for an outside entity
to come in and say,

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.780 align:middle line:84%
this is what's wrong
with your system.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who are these other
influential extraterrestrials

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:36.500 align:middle line:90%
on our governments?

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: We have the
Draconian presence.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And working for them are
several Reptoid species.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And they say that they send
them here to make sure that

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.150 align:middle line:84%
"operations" are going the
way they're supposed to go.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And what I would say when
somebody says operations,

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.600 align:middle line:84%
you know that has meaning to
me, that they've infiltrated

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and that they have an agenda
that they're carrying through.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.530 align:middle line:84%
But those are the two main
characters that we're seeing.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have these
Serpents that we

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.940 align:middle line:84%
understand to have allied
with the Draconians.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And you got to remember that
these two entities have always

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.500 align:middle line:90%
been enemies.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, they
can't stand each other.

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:15.767 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: They can't
stand each other, right.

00:19:15.767 --> 00:19:18.100 align:middle line:84%
But there has to
be something that

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:84%
has caused them to say, wait,
we'll put aside our differences

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.090 align:middle line:90%
and come together.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:25.700 align:middle line:84%
There's something far greater
to be gained from this.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So this is what's happened,
is they've allied themselves.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the Serpents
have brought a lot of technology

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.670 align:middle line:84%
that Draconians had
not been exposed

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.050 align:middle line:90%
to yet using dark matter.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's creating new
weapons, things like that.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So this would be something
that the universe is not really

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.760 align:middle line:90%
seen up to this point.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's some advantage that
it's occurring between that.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So does that mean
that we're going

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.140 align:middle line:84%
to start getting an influence
from the Serpents here?

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.970 align:middle line:84%
We had it before in our history
because we talk about the Nagas.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.780 align:middle line:90%
So there were Serpents here.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.390 align:middle line:90%
What happened to them?

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, somebody
decided they needed

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.470 align:middle line:84%
to go because of
their influence.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.900 align:middle line:90%
And so here we are.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.380 align:middle line:84%
We've had the
Draconians influencing

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.310 align:middle line:90%
the elites that are here.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.180 align:middle line:84%
We have Reptoids that are
working for the Draconians

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.830 align:middle line:84%
to further work
through that influence.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're going to
add Serpents to that.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't know
where that's going to go.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:23.990 align:middle line:84%
I just rely on
what they tell us.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying that
no good will come of this.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:34.020 align:middle line:84%
So at some point, are all the
governments laced with this?

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.950 align:middle line:90%
This is huge for us.

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't the first time
this happened in history.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's right.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you want
to control something,

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.870 align:middle line:84%
there's only several different
ways you can do that.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's either from
the top down, which

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.780 align:middle line:84%
means they have to be
infiltrated in the government,

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.340 align:middle line:84%
or you do it from a
biological aspect,

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.970 align:middle line:84%
which means that they would
affect water sources and food

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.060 align:middle line:90%
sources.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Without those things,
we're nothing.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So you want to
control something.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.260 align:middle line:84%
There's only a couple
of different ways

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.440 align:middle line:90%
in which they would do that.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.710 align:middle line:84%
But right now, what
they've done is they've

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.050 align:middle line:90%
infiltrated governments.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:84%
They're putting
policies in place

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.700 align:middle line:90%
that suit them, not suit us.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.554 align:middle line:84%
And so, ultimately,
they have a plan.

00:21:15.554 --> 00:21:17.728 align:middle line:84%
And everybody says,
well, what's that plan?

00:21:17.728 --> 00:21:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to hear a
variety of different things.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.090 align:middle line:84%
People will say, oh,
it's the new world order.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.410 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's many things.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:24.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's just that.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.890 align:middle line:84%
I think that, given
what the rest of greater

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:32.920 align:middle line:84%
cosmic communities have talked
about happening in the cosmos,

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.290 align:middle line:84%
I think there's many
different things at work here.

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.510 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a matter
of having to change.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.060 align:middle line:84%
They don't want that higher
consciousness out there.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.070 align:middle line:90%
They want enslavement.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.328 align:middle line:90%
So what's got to go?

00:21:43.328 --> 00:21:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's a control factor.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.287 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: It's a
control factor, right.

00:21:46.287 --> 00:21:48.730 align:middle line:84%
They want all the resources
that are on the planets.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So those become very specific
things that they're after.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.193 align:middle line:90%
And we're in the way.

00:21:54.193 --> 00:21:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: We are, yeah.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.752 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Well, you
mentioned the Pleiadians

00:21:57.752 --> 00:22:01.540 align:middle line:10%
and the Orions are watching
us and kind of in a way

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.460 align:middle line:10%
helping us, looking after us.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.333 align:middle line:84%
How do they feel about
this other threat?

00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well,
it's interesting.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Remember, they're
non-interventionists.

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:11.460 align:middle line:90%
That's not what they want to be.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.040 align:middle line:84%
If they knew that they
could come and make

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.040 align:middle line:84%
a difference without
causing a larger problem,

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I think that they would
have done that already.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.037 align:middle line:84%
I think what they think is
that if we can undermine--

00:22:24.037 --> 00:22:25.870 align:middle line:84%
because basically that's
what they're doing,

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.400 align:middle line:90%
is undermining the process.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.970 align:middle line:84%
They're coming in
and telepathically

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.250 align:middle line:84%
reaching out to
people and causing

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:36.602 align:middle line:84%
them to consider things
and become more aware.

00:22:36.602 --> 00:22:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And so what I think
they're looking at

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:84%
is that strength in
numbers, that we will begin

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.950 align:middle line:90%
to come together as a planet.

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And we will begin to
say, wait a minute,

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.360 align:middle line:84%
something else is going on
here, and stand up against it.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.760 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a
subtle difference.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.300 align:middle line:84%
But I think because
they can't just

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:59.040 align:middle line:84%
come in and knock the door down
because there's consequences

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.430 align:middle line:90%
for it at a greater level.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Remember, they have
to maintain peace

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.680 align:middle line:84%
for many, many civilizations out
there through the Federation.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: And so does
that put them all at risk?

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And so we're one
planet against many.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can they interact with
the Dracos behind the scenes

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.400 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know about?

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, and
they do to a degree.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they have
fleet services.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.870 align:middle line:90%
And here, we have this--

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.620 align:middle line:84%
they've told us there's
a big cruiser sitting out

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.060 align:middle line:84%
behind our moon that's
protecting our backs.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.543 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:23:31.543 --> 00:23:33.960 align:middle line:84%
They're just going to watch
them come in and do something?

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.690 align:middle line:84%
No, if need be, they
will interact with them.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:40.080 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is is that
they also have these--

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.500 align:middle line:84%
the Dracos will do something
totally unexpected.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.150 align:middle line:90%
And that becomes the problem.

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.040 align:middle line:84%
They've witnessed that
over and over again.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't want to put
whole civilizations at risk

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.130 align:middle line:90%
if they don't have to.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:57.620 align:middle line:84%
So you're playing that
long-term game right now

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:03.120 align:middle line:84%
of trying to placate and
yet undermine over here.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:09.395 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really a strategy
that's being played out.

00:24:09.395 --> 00:24:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I had a three week period where
I didn't hear from Wikmua.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I'm concerned
because he's been in my ear

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.300 align:middle line:90%
every single day.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, another
Pleiadian came

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and said he has been
taken by the Draconians

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:26.760 align:middle line:84%
because they knew that
he was playing this game.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, fortunately, he
was rescued from that.

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:34.400 align:middle line:84%
But they're willing
to do anything

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.650 align:middle line:84%
as long as they can keep
their agenda at play.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.925 align:middle line:90%
And so here's these conclaves.

00:24:40.925 --> 00:24:42.300 align:middle line:84%
That's not what
they're here for.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.740 align:middle line:84%
They're here to do studies,
learn about the planet

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.640 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the case may be.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:53.190 align:middle line:84%
They're also trying to insert
these awarenesses in there.

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And so it isn't just us that
they inserted an awareness

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.500 align:middle line:90%
into when they came here.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
going out globally.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.230 align:middle line:90%
But it's like everything else--

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:06.810 align:middle line:84%
is somebody paying attention
and hearing the message?

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And what I hope is that
people watching this,

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.490 align:middle line:84%
they'll start going,
oh, wait a minute.

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.403 align:middle line:84%
I'm already aware because
I'm watching these episodes.

00:25:14.403 --> 00:25:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's right.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.098 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: And so I should
start paying more attention

00:25:18.098 --> 00:25:19.140 align:middle line:90%
to what's coming through.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Those aren't just random
thoughts coming in.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.330 align:middle line:84%
These are things that
they're supplanting

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:29.390 align:middle line:84%
by telepathy into our minds so
that we will become more aware.

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So what I hope is
that people will start

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:32.930 align:middle line:90%
paying more attention to that.

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:33.800 align:middle line:90%
What can I do?

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, just by your energy
alone, adding to that

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:90%
increases that awareness.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
undermining effect,

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:45.550 align:middle line:84%
is that when suddenly you wake
up and you started out with two

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:48.550 align:middle line:84%
people and all of a
sudden it's 10,000 people.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:52.720 align:middle line:84%
That's really what starts
undermining those agendas that

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.540 align:middle line:90%
are happening.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And they begin to
see what's happening.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:59.885 align:middle line:84%
We just saw a news article where
laws were beginning to change.

00:25:59.885 --> 00:26:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right, yeah.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: And it is
that undermining effect

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:06.710 align:middle line:84%
that has everything to do
with making that happen.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:10.220 align:middle line:84%
So like I say, here's
your opportunity.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.230 align:middle line:84%
You're already
watching the episodes.

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:15.580 align:middle line:84%
So the awareness is there,
higher consciousness.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.380 align:middle line:84%
You just need to take
it to the next step

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and start becoming aware that
they are trying-- especially

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.620 align:middle line:84%
the Arcturians, they are trying
to telepathically get through

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.970 align:middle line:84%
to us and say, this is
what you need to do.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:27.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the way
you need to think.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:28.385 align:middle line:90%
This is the next step.

00:26:28.385 --> 00:26:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In light of
what you just described,

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.668 align:middle line:84%
what is the potential
of humanity right now?

00:26:32.668 --> 00:26:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well,
that's the one thing

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.980 align:middle line:84%
each of the members
of the conclave said,

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.780 align:middle line:84%
is that we have
so much potential

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.260 align:middle line:90%
that we're not aware of.

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a wonderful thing.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.900 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is is
that we're just now

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.000 align:middle line:84%
becoming aware of
those different things.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And so what they're hoping
is that-- here's the thing.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:52.660 align:middle line:84%
You can learn something
really fast and then

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:53.930 align:middle line:90%
forget it tomorrow.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:56.350 align:middle line:84%
What they're hoping
is that we learn it

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.640 align:middle line:90%
and then we start to become it.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Because then once we
become it, we own it.

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what they're saying,

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:08.350 align:middle line:84%
is that you have all
the abilities to be just

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.370 align:middle line:90%
like us and more.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:12.182 align:middle line:90%
But we have to put the work in.

00:27:12.182 --> 00:27:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's the problem,
is that a lot of people

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.290 align:middle line:90%
don't want to put the work in.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:16.832 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
change themselves.

00:27:16.832 --> 00:27:18.710 align:middle line:84%
They're happy with
the way they are know.

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.890 align:middle line:84%
But that's a physical
existence here.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:23.570 align:middle line:84%
That isn't part of that
greater cosmic community.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And so what we need
them to realize

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.810 align:middle line:90%
is that take that potential.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Work towards something higher.

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:31.450 align:middle line:90%
Become a better--

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:32.665 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Take a
conscious effort--

00:27:32.665 --> 00:27:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Exactly.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: --to be more
aware and change.

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Right, become a more
enlightened, better version

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:38.900 align:middle line:90%
of yourself.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And so where do I think
we're going to be?

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:45.622 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're intelligent
enough to come together.

00:27:45.622 --> 00:27:47.080 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole
purpose that we've

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.000 align:middle line:84%
done with Commonwealth,
to say we have

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.930 align:middle line:90%
to unite humanity together.

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:54.620 align:middle line:84%
We have to realize that there's
something more happening.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.590 align:middle line:84%
We have to become part of
that greater cosmic community.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:84%
We have to start
learning that there's

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.900 align:middle line:84%
a knowledge that-- it should
be shared by all of us,

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.160 align:middle line:90%
not just the select few.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.190 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand
that technology

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:09.550 align:middle line:84%
needs to be shared by all
of us, not the select few,

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and that we need to
change the way in which we

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:12.905 align:middle line:90%
deal with each other.

00:28:12.905 --> 00:28:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Because what's going to happen
when you're standing there

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and you see another species
that doesn't look like us?

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.510 align:middle line:90%
How are we going to react?

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:23.890 align:middle line:84%
We have to quit letting
fear and paranoia drive us.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really a
lot of that potential

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:28.912 align:middle line:84%
that we need to learn now, is,
how are we going to do that?

00:28:28.912 --> 00:28:30.120 align:middle line:90%
And we need to come together.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.057 align:middle line:84%
And we need to start
talking about it.

00:28:32.057 --> 00:28:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So where do I think
we're going to go?

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.770 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to
have a huge awakening.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:37.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that people
are going to realize

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.710 align:middle line:84%
that we do need to get back into
the greater cosmic communities.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:43.360 align:middle line:84%
We need to get back
to our lineages.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.890 align:middle line:84%
We need to have a huge
educational awakening in itself

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:50.730 align:middle line:84%
because this is going to be
all new territory for us.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that,
really, once we

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:55.570 align:middle line:84%
realize that, we're going
to be a much better species.

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:57.450 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful, Victoria.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:59.483 align:middle line:84%
And I really love what
you're doing out there.

00:28:59.483 --> 00:29:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Oh, thanks.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I want to thank
you for being on the show.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, I appreciate
you having me here again.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.260 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith.

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.970 align:middle line:90%
And this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:08.400 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
