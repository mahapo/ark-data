00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:16.239 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: All right.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.010 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back to
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
here with Emery Smith.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And in this episode, we're going
to talk about organic craft.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome back to the show.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY SMITH: Thanks, Dave.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.975 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So in order to
open up this discussion,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:84%
let's go back to
your time at Sandia

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.260 align:middle line:84%
because we really have barely
scratched the surface of that

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.060 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we're going to get
into this organic craft thing,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:84%
but before we do, you
had talked about the fact

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.850 align:middle line:84%
that, in the beginning, you were
getting these partial bodies.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.860 align:middle line:84%
After you got through
the salmon fillet phase,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.310 align:middle line:84%
and then you got through the
arms and legs type of phase,

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:90%
you got partial bodies.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Correct.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So the
first partial body

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.505 align:middle line:84%
that you told us about
was, again, what?

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The crossbreed
tiger-type human hybrid.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.810 align:middle line:84%
That was the one, it's very
disfigured and dysmorphed.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.930 align:middle line:10%
And then the next one that
followed that was the, more

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.530 align:middle line:10%
of the smooth skin
with the leopard skin,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.940 align:middle line:10%
but with iridescent-- like
the peacock feather colors--

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:17.990 align:middle line:10%
skin.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And that face was a
little bit mutilated,

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:84%
so I couldn't see the actual--
but it was a very normal-sized

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.360 align:middle line:90%
skull, just like a human.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.030 align:middle line:84%
The body was very
thin and lanky.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And these bodies is what
brought me to see craft.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Because later on, some of the
tissue samples I was taking,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.300 align:middle line:84%
they asked me to
come take samples

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.810 align:middle line:84%
from a completely different
part of the base--

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:90%
or this underground facility--

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:55.300 align:middle line:84%
that I would have to travel to
and also escort those samples

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.770 align:middle line:84%
back to my base-- which
was unusual for me,

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.605 align:middle line:84%
to be a carrier, but it was
all within the underground.

00:02:02.605 --> 00:02:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So if I'm getting
this correctly then,

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.479 align:middle line:84%
what you're saying is,
that in certain cases,

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.160 align:middle line:84%
you were working on a
body, or a partial body,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.560 align:middle line:84%
but then they had
reason to believe

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:84%
that there might be some
biological similarity

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.132 align:middle line:84%
between the body and the actual
craft that the body was in.

00:02:21.132 --> 00:02:21.932 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:02:21.932 --> 00:02:22.732 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:02:22.732 --> 00:02:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And so they would
come on intercom

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and actually say, all
right, that's enough.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm doing samples the
whole time, and giving them.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.890 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I get a sample,
I put it through the window.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So they're already
testing, in the back,

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.540 align:middle line:90%
the genetics of this thing.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.415 align:middle line:84%
So I just remember them
coming on and saying,

00:02:42.415 --> 00:02:45.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's enough Smith,
we need you to go do a run.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even
know what that meant,

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.298 align:middle line:90%
because I'd never done a run.

00:02:47.298 --> 00:02:49.774 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do you think
that the people that

00:02:49.774 --> 00:02:51.190 align:middle line:84%
are on the other
side of the glass

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.180 align:middle line:84%
that you pass these samples
into are more specialized

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.560 align:middle line:90%
and skilled workers than you?

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, absolutely.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.230 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm just a technician.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:84%
These, probably, are the
scientists and geneticists

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.170 align:middle line:84%
that taught me later on all
about that kind of thing.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.720 align:middle line:84%
These people are probably
those people grabbing it,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:84%
running it through some advanced
fast scanner of some sort.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
always immediately

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.830 align:middle line:84%
would come back, within minutes
of me giving a sample, as I'm

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.620 align:middle line:84%
taking another sample
and say, stop that, go up

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and grab something
from the inner ear,

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.090 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.250 align:middle line:84%
So they were
immediately, probably,

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.530 align:middle line:84%
another team behind
these windows

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:84%
that are trying
to find something

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.085 align:middle line:90%
out specific from this species.

00:03:33.085 --> 00:03:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did you ever
get to meet any of them?

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.485 align:middle line:84%
Or did you recognize any
voices as being common voices?

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, I did later
on, but I was not really

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.120 align:middle line:84%
allowed to hang out with
them or talk to them.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.600 align:middle line:84%
But I see people
in the locker room,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:84%
I see people in the cafeteria,
I see people on the outside,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.900 align:middle line:84%
but not until way later
on down the road did

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I actually get to meet
people that were actually

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:90%
those people.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So do you
think, in some cases,

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.275 align:middle line:84%
that the tissue was able to be
reproduced, like to be grown?

00:04:05.275 --> 00:04:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, for sure.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.550 align:middle line:84%
That's definitely
what they were doing.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.110 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
reproduce these cells.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So then, you said
that at certain points

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.490 align:middle line:84%
they might ask you to take
tissue from the inner ear

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.300 align:middle line:90%
and stop what you were doing.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Do you think they have a
database of the tissue samples,

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and when they make tests
they're comparing it

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.270 align:middle line:90%
to other parts of--

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.650 align:middle line:90%
It depends.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.720 align:middle line:84%
They're not only taking
the tissue to reproduce.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.430 align:middle line:90%
They're studying the tissue.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:84%
They're studying
the eardrum, they're

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.390 align:middle line:84%
studying the phrenic
nerve, they're

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.670 align:middle line:84%
studying the heart
muscle of this being,

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.220 align:middle line:84%
they're studying all
sorts of different parts

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:84%
of this body for some reason,
for their own, who knows.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.800 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just one thing.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.420 align:middle line:84%
They're doing many
different things

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.970 align:middle line:84%
with the body for
their own reasons

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they just need
that optical nerve

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.590 align:middle line:84%
because they want to
know how they see.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they need that
tendon to see what

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.520 align:middle line:84%
those tenocytes are made out
of, because it replicates

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.770 align:middle line:90%
so quickly in a Petri dish--

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.690 align:middle line:84%
one of the hardest
cells to replicate.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So I think they're just
studying this like we are.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.970 align:middle line:84%
I think some of it sometimes
may be used for evil,

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and I think some of it is just
trying to learn and find out,

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.750 align:middle line:84%
what are these beings,
and where they come from,

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.150 align:middle line:84%
and what are they made
up of, and so forth.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: All right.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I want to run
something else by you.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.118 align:middle line:84%
Since you brought this up, I
think it's a fascinating thing

00:05:32.118 --> 00:05:33.780 align:middle line:90%
to discuss.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Well before I ever
met Corey Goode--

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.640 align:middle line:84%
I knew of him, but if we
hadn't gotten into this stuff

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.040 align:middle line:90%
till 2014, 2015--

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I had been speaking to
this insider, Jacob.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And he told me, at some length,
that the Draco reptilian beings

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:84%
had essentially been
all over our galaxy

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:84%
looking for various
genetic materials.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And then they had taken
the very best of the things

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.200 align:middle line:84%
that they found and had somehow
spliced it in with themselves,

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and had created a sort of
super being out of themselves.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it's
possible that we

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.720 align:middle line:84%
could be on a similar
trajectory right

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.307 align:middle line:84%
now, by all this
genetic research

00:06:18.307 --> 00:06:19.390 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about?

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.360 align:middle line:84%
I agree with that
tremendously, just

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.570 align:middle line:84%
because of all the
different requests

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and the different
briefings I've been

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.730 align:middle line:90%
involved with in this MILAB.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And not to say it was--
like I always tell you-- not

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.970 align:middle line:84%
to say it was owned by
Sandia or Los Alamos,

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.940 align:middle line:84%
those are just names for
cover-ups of corporations,

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.770 align:middle line:84%
people need to
know that as well.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just that's where I
was, that's the area I was.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, getting back to
your question-- yes.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.910 align:middle line:84%
I believe they were
trying to get this DNA

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.210 align:middle line:84%
and somehow mix
it with human DNA,

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:02.320 align:middle line:84%
and create, or inject, some
inoculation into a human being

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.080 align:middle line:84%
to see if they could
mutate and have

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:11.152 align:middle line:84%
different factors and different
abilities that beings have.

00:07:11.152 --> 00:07:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Well, like eagles.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, an eagle
could see a dime

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.766 align:middle line:84%
from the top of the Empire
State Building on the sidewalk.

00:07:17.766 --> 00:07:20.140 align:middle line:84%
So if we had that kind of
vision, that would be exciting.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, it would.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.010 align:middle line:84%
But then I would have to
clean my house extra, extra,

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.140 align:middle line:90%
extra hard.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.280 align:middle line:90%
Because I don't like dust.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.908 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So at one point, you-- or maybe
more than once-- but at least

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:42.260 align:middle line:84%
once you were called in to
a different location because

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:84%
of this craft being
organic, they thought.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.180 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that now.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well that's when
I said they were like,

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.668 align:middle line:90%
stop what you're doing.

00:07:49.668 --> 00:07:54.210 align:middle line:84%
No one's ever said, stop what
you're doing and go change out,

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.010 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And change out just means
get out of the spacesuit.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.384 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I did.

00:08:00.384 --> 00:08:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And they were right
there, and they were like,

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:84%
we want you to go here,
and take the tube,

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.330 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
be dropped off here,

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.900 align:middle line:84%
and so-and-so will be there
to escort you to this area.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And that was a longest ride
I've ever been on a maglev tube.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Like a sub shuttle?

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.750 align:middle line:84%
It was a sub shuttle
capsule, it was a capsule.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Because you can't ask anything.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.520 align:middle line:90%
You understand, you cannot--

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.880 align:middle line:84%
they did tell me that this
being came from this craft,

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.396 align:middle line:90%
they did tell me that.

00:08:30.396 --> 00:08:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And that I was supposed
to take these samples

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.150 align:middle line:84%
from this part of the craft,
I had my folder with me,

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.150 align:middle line:90%
and was escorted to this--

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.270 align:middle line:84%
this was one of the first
times I rode this thing--

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.799 align:middle line:90%
and got there.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:45.800 align:middle line:84%
These two guys came out,
one was a security guard

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.254 align:middle line:84%
and one was a scientist, and
there was no other security.

00:08:50.254 --> 00:08:52.170 align:middle line:84%
You didn't even have to
pass through anything.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.950 align:middle line:84%
So it must have been
already, once you get under,

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.697 align:middle line:84%
then you can go
pretty much anywhere.

00:08:56.697 --> 00:08:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Can you describe
what the room looked like once

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.470 align:middle line:90%
you got out of the capsule?

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, sure.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:06.320 align:middle line:84%
It looked just like a very
clean, New York subway station.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But another all white
area, very clean, very silent,

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.855 align:middle line:90%
you could hear a pin drop.

00:09:17.855 --> 00:09:19.786 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did you have
some sort of container

00:09:19.786 --> 00:09:20.660 align:middle line:90%
with you for samples?

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, nothing.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.180 align:middle line:90%
I had the folder.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But what do
you do with the sample?

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they
have everything there.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:32.880 align:middle line:84%
This operating room I was
in, this room, this thing

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.290 align:middle line:84%
isn't a huge operating
room, this craft.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.420 align:middle line:84%
So you walked into some sort
of room where the craft was?

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, first
I had to go change.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.560 align:middle line:84%
They made me change
again into another,

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.150 align:middle line:84%
very similar like a locker room,
but I didn't see any colors

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.370 align:middle line:84%
on the floors like in the
hallways I told you about,

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:56.930 align:middle line:90%
the color codes.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And there was always
someone with me.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.910 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't let me be alone.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.500 align:middle line:84%
So I walked for at
least 10 minutes

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:84%
down a very long,
white hallway, there

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.730 align:middle line:84%
was many doors on the
sides of the hallway,

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:15.570 align:middle line:84%
like every 100 feet,
and the door opened,

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.400 align:middle line:90%
and there I was in this giant--

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:25.650 align:middle line:84%
what I would call--
a sterile hanger.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.250 align:middle line:84%
A sterile hanger is
what I'll call it.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And there was this craft there,
and there was many people

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:84%
there, a lot of
people running around,

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.480 align:middle line:84%
they were all, of
course, in clean scrubs,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle line:90%
had the white jackets.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, you would
assume a couple of things.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.530 align:middle line:84%
You would assume this is an
underground base, that it's

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.807 align:middle line:84%
on Earth most likely, or we
don't really know that, right?

00:10:48.807 --> 00:10:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Because the tube could have
taken you to another planet,

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle line:90%
potentially.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.786 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't tell you one
way or the other, I assume.

00:10:56.786 --> 00:11:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And that those other doors
would have other craft

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.250 align:middle line:90%
of some kind in them as well.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.167 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, for sure.

00:11:03.167 --> 00:11:05.791 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they made sure that
you only went to the one door,

00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:07.675 align:middle line:84%
so you couldn't possibly
have gone and tried

00:11:07.675 --> 00:11:08.550 align:middle line:90%
to open another door.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: There's no way.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:84%
They had biometric, they
had so many ways just

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:17.040 align:middle line:90%
to get in that door.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.290 align:middle line:84%
He did the same
thing we would do

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.160 align:middle line:84%
at the top of the
facial recognition,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.820 align:middle line:90%
and the hand print.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:84%
They're getting a little
bit more different now.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.470 align:middle line:90%
Now they're doing a DNA thing.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.428 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, we'll get
into that in on another--

00:11:30.428 --> 00:11:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: So, what do you see?

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.198 align:middle line:84%
What does this thing look like
when you walk into the room?

00:11:34.198 --> 00:11:38.492 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's hard to explain,
but if you ever ate ice cream,

00:11:38.492 --> 00:11:39.950 align:middle line:84%
like if I had an
ice cream scooper,

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.490 align:middle line:90%
and you make those round scoops.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you ever made jello
in one of those containers

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.009 align:middle line:84%
where it goes like this,
and then like this, and then

00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:46.808 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:11:46.808 --> 00:11:47.655 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh.

00:11:47.655 --> 00:11:48.165 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: OK?

00:11:48.165 --> 00:11:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Do you understand?

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
shape to call that.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: It was a jello tree.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It was
like a jello tree.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:54.690 align:middle line:90%
It was.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.870 align:middle line:90%
And it was like this.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.294 align:middle line:90%
And it was the most beautiful--

00:11:58.294 --> 00:12:00.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't like the color red-- but
it was the most beautiful color

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.475 align:middle line:90%
red I've ever seen.

00:12:02.475 --> 00:12:03.795 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Glossy?

00:12:03.795 --> 00:12:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:05.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:90%
Very reflective.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Any seams
or just smooth?

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No seams at
all, completely smooth.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And it did not
give off any light,

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:19.281 align:middle line:84%
but it was kind of transparent
and looked kind of like jello.

00:12:19.281 --> 00:12:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You could
sort of see through it?

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it was kind
of transparent, a little bit.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: No discernible
features on its surface?

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.360 align:middle line:90%
No writing?

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:27.990 align:middle line:90%
No windows?

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Nothing.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:29.760 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.650 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did they know
how the beings got

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:34.410 align:middle line:90%
in or out of it, of the craft?

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:36.586 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:36.586 --> 00:12:37.710 align:middle line:90%
Because I had to go inside.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, wow.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.660 align:middle line:90%
And that was wild.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:47.190 align:middle line:84%
So, I have this schematic,
I have actually two other

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:84%
technicians that are
here-- they work here--

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.660 align:middle line:84%
and they're with me, with
all the sampling containers,

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.140 align:middle line:84%
and you have to do this
in a very sterile fashion

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:58.045 align:middle line:84%
with special instruments,
and it's all right there.

00:12:58.045 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Was the schematic on
something like your folder?

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it
was on the folder.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.720 align:middle line:84%
This exact craft was on
the folder-- head-to-toe,

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.820 align:middle line:90%
inside, outside, everything.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so these two
guys are with me.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.290 align:middle line:84%
We're walking up to
the craft, and I'm

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:14.220 align:middle line:84%
allowed to share, they know, of
course, everything I'm doing,

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.460 align:middle line:84%
they're assisting
me, which is cool.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So I get to this
point on the craft,

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.990 align:middle line:84%
and basically cut a
piece of the craft

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:29.060 align:middle line:90%
away with a special device.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was just like the
tissue from the being.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.046 align:middle line:90%
Same consistency.

00:13:35.046 --> 00:13:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Which, I didn't tell you
about that specific being,

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.390 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.900 align:middle line:84%
But it was very the same
consistency of that.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.350 align:middle line:84%
They took me around to the other
side and I took another piece,

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and went underneath, and went
in the middle of this thing,

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.490 align:middle line:90%
because it's suspended.

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:53.379 align:middle line:90%
And it is suspended, there are--

00:13:53.379 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it
was metal, or what

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.480 align:middle line:84%
it was-- but it was
on something that

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.999 align:middle line:90%
was keeping it up in the air.

00:13:57.999 --> 00:13:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Like a
chassis of some kind?

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.020 align:middle line:84%
They had built
something to keep this

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:07.045 align:middle line:84%
off the ground about nine feet,
nine to ten feet, I would say.

00:14:07.045 --> 00:14:10.082 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did it move
or wiggle at all?

00:14:10.082 --> 00:14:11.540 align:middle line:84%
You say it was like
jello, I'm just

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.331 align:middle line:84%
wondering how far we
can take that analogy.

00:14:13.331 --> 00:14:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It was solid,
but the consistency

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and the transparency of the
first inch of this craft

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.650 align:middle line:84%
was transparent, like Plexiglas,
you could kind of see into it.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And then it just stopped,
because it got darker.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:30.726 align:middle line:84%
It got darker, I think, with
the color, as you looked in.

00:14:30.726 --> 00:14:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you go underneath
it, and what do you see?

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.906 align:middle line:90%
How do you get inside?

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So underneath are
all these other round cup,

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:45.180 align:middle line:84%
like if you had cut a
baseball sized sphere in half

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:50.720 align:middle line:84%
and now you have that round
cup, and you would pop it

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.920 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom of this craft.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.190 align:middle line:84%
There was thousands
of these little bumps,

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:58.130 align:middle line:90%
these half spheres on it.

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.130 align:middle line:84%
So I was also instructed
to take this sphere

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:06.380 align:middle line:84%
near the center of the craft,
which was kind of hollow.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.450 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And it just came
right off, it was not

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.330 align:middle line:84%
like something you had
to take a chainsaw,

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.860 align:middle line:90%
to it was very simple.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:18.030 align:middle line:84%
It was like cutting into
human tissue or tissue

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.830 align:middle line:90%
from an animal.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.621 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Was this some
sort of beam cutter,

00:15:20.621 --> 00:15:21.890 align:middle line:90%
or was it more of a scalpel?

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I'd rather not say
anything the exact device.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:30.200 align:middle line:84%
But all I can say, it
was made for cutting

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.790 align:middle line:84%
pretty much any type of tissue
without destroying the tissue.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And that'll probably come
out to the public soon.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:42.920 align:middle line:84%
So we took that, and went down
the center, and in the center

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.590 align:middle line:84%
they had this little device like
you see in the warehouses that

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.660 align:middle line:84%
go up and down, and
we got on this thing,

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:84%
and it lifted us up, and it goes
all the way up into the thing.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:58.540 align:middle line:84%
But it's just a wall with all
those bubbles on it again.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So, I don't know if that's
the inside because it

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.460 align:middle line:90%
was hollow on the inside.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So I went all the
way to the top,

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:08.350 align:middle line:84%
and there was this
one big, big bubble

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:11.980 align:middle line:90%
on the inside of this thing.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:12.880 align:middle line:90%
Big sphere.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.840 align:middle line:90%
Three feet in diameter.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.380 align:middle line:84%
They would never allow me to
go in there if it wasn't safe.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Of course it wasn't radioactive,
but it had this glowing,

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.547 align:middle line:84%
kind of like on your Apple
computer, that scary Apple

00:16:25.547 --> 00:16:27.380 align:middle line:84%
computer light I don't
like to see at night.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.950 align:middle line:90%


00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.130 align:middle line:90%
It was like that.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.180 align:middle line:84%
So it was doing this thing,
and I felt kind of bad.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.610 align:middle line:84%
I was like I think maybe
this thing might be still

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.080 align:middle line:90%
alive or something.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.590 align:middle line:84%
So I took a small sample of
that, a very small sample,

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:45.640 align:middle line:84%
that's what they asked for,
small sample of like a punch

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.860 align:middle line:84%
biopsy, we would
call, it's probably

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.900 align:middle line:84%
like the size of an eraser
tip, that's how much I took.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And handed it off to the
guys, they wrapped it all up,

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.880 align:middle line:84%
put in a special box for
me, and next thing I know,

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm back being
escorted right out.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.050 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing took
less than two hours.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Is the box clear?

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.550 align:middle line:84%
It was a silver box,
and it has inside

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:13.960 align:middle line:84%
a special canister
that regulates

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.690 align:middle line:90%
temperature inside the box.

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:20.859 align:middle line:84%
And the box is specifically
made for these samples,

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:90%
like already pre-cut.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.002 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like, you get
those pelican cases

00:17:25.002 --> 00:17:26.710 align:middle line:84%
and they pre-cut the
insides of them out.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:28.780 align:middle line:84%
It was just like
that, but it was

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.020 align:middle line:84%
vacuum packed and vacuum sealed,
and it was very lightweight.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So, let's
talk about this.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:84%
This craft is so bizarre,
it's so unlike what any of us

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.249 align:middle line:90%
would have expected you to say.

00:17:40.249 --> 00:17:41.540 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about the being now.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.873 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I know it sounds crazy.

00:17:42.873 --> 00:17:43.866 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: No, it's cool.

00:17:43.866 --> 00:17:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about the being.

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:46.210 align:middle line:90%
What was the being like?

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The being
was very similar.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.230 align:middle line:90%
It had a red consistency.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.979 align:middle line:84%
Remember I told you about
that jelly-like creature,

00:17:55.979 --> 00:17:58.270 align:middle line:84%
like we talked about, the
transparent one before, which

00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.810 align:middle line:90%
we'll get into later?

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:04.430 align:middle line:84%
But this one was solid, and it
was just perfect human shape.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:09.190 align:middle line:84%
It had a face, though, that
comes to a point instead.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.830 align:middle line:90%
So the face comes this way.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:22.930 align:middle line:84%
It reminded me of if you get an
acorn, the shape of an acorn.

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And you know how it
does have this cup-like,

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:84%
it's not perfectly round,
it has this teardrop-type.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you get the
teardrop, and then you

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.620 align:middle line:84%
just squish it a little
bit, it was just like that.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.390 align:middle line:84%
But by squishing it, not
that it would bulb out,

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:44.845 align:middle line:90%
but it would come to a point.

00:18:44.845 --> 00:18:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What was the size of
the facial features compared

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:90%
to the size of the head?

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Like if you could
map it out with--

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It was very
similar to a human's.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Like, as far as how far the
eyes were-- because that's

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:55.904 align:middle line:90%
one thing we measure.

00:18:55.904 --> 00:18:58.560 align:middle line:84%
We measure across
the eyes, we do

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.770 align:middle line:84%
a symmetrical test like
plastic surgeons do.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.570 align:middle line:84%
So we want to see symmetry,
we always measure all of that,

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:08.920 align:middle line:84%
and we also have a scanner
that goes over the whole body

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.940 align:middle line:90%
to 3D replicate it, and models.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:17.770 align:middle line:84%
So every creature they have is
already 3D model replicated.

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a whole
museum of this, by the way,

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:25.900 align:middle line:84%
of these craft and
all the beings,

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.750 align:middle line:84%
all 3D replicated in
many different materials

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:32.882 align:middle line:84%
is like this secret museum
with all this stuff in it

00:19:32.882 --> 00:19:34.090 align:middle line:90%
that's locked away somewhere.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't know it's
at, I have no idea.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:39.160 align:middle line:84%
But I have seen
many of the models

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.940 align:middle line:84%
in the projects for
specific beings.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So when you
say the eyes were white,

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.719 align:middle line:84%
are they round, are
they almond shaped,

00:19:47.719 --> 00:19:48.760 align:middle line:90%
are they like human eyes?

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.590 align:middle line:90%
What would the eyes look like?

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, they
were more round

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.460 align:middle line:84%
than the typical almond shape,
but they were the same size.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And this creature was probably
5'5", about 5'5", 5-foot 5

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:01.330 align:middle line:90%
inches tall.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Was it just all
white, or did it have something

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:04.960 align:middle line:90%
like an iris or pupil?

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.626 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, there
was a different color

00:20:06.626 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:84%
white in the middle, but
it was still all white.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
circle in the middle

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:15.580 align:middle line:84%
that was whiter than
the rest of the eye.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.140 align:middle line:90%
So you could see that.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And my part of
that being was not

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:26.020 align:middle line:84%
to have anything to do with the
face or the eye for sampling.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.850 align:middle line:84%
I was actually down
low doing something

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:31.390 align:middle line:84%
with the reproductive system,
taking some reproductive organs

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:35.215 align:middle line:84%
out, when they told me to
stop and go to do the run.

00:20:35.215 --> 00:20:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did these
beings have a skeleton?

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.046 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:20:39.046 --> 00:20:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And how similar to us
would the skeletal structure

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.030 align:middle line:90%
be, from what you could tell?

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Just from where I
was working, in the pelvis,

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:47.870 align:middle line:90%
it was very similar.

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:49.820 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see anything different.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.900 align:middle line:84%
I did not see the X-ray of
that, or the CAT scan, or MRI,

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.620 align:middle line:90%
or what we call the--

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:59.250 align:middle line:84%
well, we have a special scanner
that scans the whole body.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And you can really see
everything all at once

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.850 align:middle line:84%
before you go in, but I didn't
get to see it on this being.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:08.757 align:middle line:84%
I only got to see the scan
for the reproductive area.

00:21:08.757 --> 00:21:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did it have
hands like we do?

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: And how many fingers?

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: But they were smaller.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:90%
They were smaller and thinner.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:17.450 align:middle line:90%
And longer.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:18.533 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: How many fingers?

00:21:18.533 --> 00:21:19.845 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: They had five fingers.

00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But longer
fingers, you said?

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.663 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, they were longer.

00:21:22.663 --> 00:21:25.280 align:middle line:84%
A lot longer than
our fingers by--

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.760 align:middle line:84%
I have a size 9 hand,
which is pretty big.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.060 align:middle line:84%
I would say these
creatures would probably

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:37.190 align:middle line:84%
have fingers maybe 30%
longer than our fingers.

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they were very
long and very thin.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:43.430 align:middle line:90%
And they did have fingerprints.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:middle line:90%
They had prints on them.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And their skin was just
like this, but it was red.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Oh, so it was actually
more like a human in the way

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.190 align:middle line:90%
the texture of the skin?

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And what
kind of red would you

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.380 align:middle line:84%
say it was, if you had to
describe the red a little more

00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.180 align:middle line:90%
in detail?

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Like a brick red, rose
red, if you mix that together.

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:90%
It was a nice red.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:09.900 align:middle line:90%
It was like a matte brick red.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.760 align:middle line:84%
But not as dark as brick
red, little bit lighter.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.545 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Did it
have any body hair?

00:22:15.545 --> 00:22:17.265 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:22:17.265 --> 00:22:18.065 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:22:18.065 --> 00:22:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What would
be the proportions

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:24.470 align:middle line:84%
of the skull to the body,
compared to one of us?

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The skull
was a little larger

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.770 align:middle line:84%
than a normal human
skull, and the torso

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.150 align:middle line:90%
was smaller than our torso.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:36.530 align:middle line:84%
But the legs were
longer, and the arms

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:40.760 align:middle line:84%
were a lot longer than our
arms, to say the least,

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.020 align:middle line:90%
as far as symmetry.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So do you
think that if somebody

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.850 align:middle line:84%
who didn't know anything were
to have one of these walk

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:49.520 align:middle line:84%
up to them, with these
white eyes and red skin,

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:53.024 align:middle line:84%
do you think they
would be terrified?

00:22:53.024 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Or did it have a
noble look to it?

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I don't believe so.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:58.595 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the fear that's
installed and programmed

00:22:58.595 --> 00:23:00.260 align:middle line:90%
into us, yes, maybe.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:04.604 align:middle line:84%
But you have to understand,
when you approach,

00:23:04.604 --> 00:23:06.020 align:middle line:84%
usually,
extraterrestrials, you're

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.730 align:middle line:90%
going to know right away.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Like that guy hiding
in the corners

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.830 align:middle line:84%
or walking around the alley,
he just doesn't feel right.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:14.690 align:middle line:90%
You get that feeling.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Never use this, always
use your heart to feel.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think that,
for the most part,

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:26.360 align:middle line:84%
on first seeing something,
you could possibly maybe

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.150 align:middle line:84%
have a fear factor
involved if you have not

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:31.340 align:middle line:84%
been in these projects,
of have never seen this,

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and you're 15 years
old and you're

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.240 align:middle line:84%
in the woods and
here this thing,

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:39.680 align:middle line:84%
yeah, they're probably going
to scream bloody murder.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.290 align:middle line:84%
But then again, if
this was walking down

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:45.140 align:middle line:84%
the streets of New York,
I think most of the people

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.510 align:middle line:84%
would be more enticed
about it and not go

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.460 align:middle line:90%
throw rocks and hatchets at it.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:84%
I think they would be
coming up and, here you

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:56.690 align:middle line:84%
have this being with its
arms open, with no weapons,

00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:00.080 align:middle line:84%
not hurting anyone, not
saying anything, let's say,

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and emanating a very
good peaceful energy,

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.060 align:middle line:84%
or negative energy,
whatever the being is.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.550 align:middle line:84%
People are going to
respond in the right way.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:08.690 align:middle line:90%
I believe in the people.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:10.398 align:middle line:84%
I believe people will
do the right thing.

00:24:10.398 --> 00:24:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What was the most
physiologically abnormal

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.340 align:middle line:84%
or different thing
about this being

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.190 align:middle line:84%
that you saw either on
the MRI or in the autopsy?

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.979 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It was the uterus.

00:24:20.979 --> 00:24:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What was
different about it?

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It had four chambers.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.625 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:24:26.625 --> 00:24:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And did they have
any speculation as to what

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:29.879 align:middle line:90%
that might be for?

00:24:29.879 --> 00:24:30.795 align:middle line:90%
Did it have multiple--

00:24:30.795 --> 00:24:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It can have multiple
children all at the same time--

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.280 align:middle line:90%
4 children, or 6, or 8, or 12.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Very interesting.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Is that something
that might be common,

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.480 align:middle line:90%
or is that kind of unusual?

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.715 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's very unusual.

00:24:44.715 --> 00:24:49.200 align:middle line:84%
It means that species can
multiply very quickly.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And they have a way of measuring
the chemicals in the body

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.360 align:middle line:84%
to measure how fast they can
gestate, which is really cool.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Here's what
I don't understand--

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.500 align:middle line:84%
the uterus has all
these chambers,

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.460 align:middle line:84%
but it would appear, based on
conventional human gestation,

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:10.110 align:middle line:84%
that the baby has to grow
to a large enough size

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:13.040 align:middle line:90%
to really kind of fill the womb.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.500 align:middle line:84%
How could a being
have so many chambers

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:21.080 align:middle line:84%
and still have the offspring
able to actually be born and be

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.312 align:middle line:90%
healthy?

00:25:22.312 --> 00:25:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We believe that this
being only has babies once

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:90%
in their lifetime.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible, after
that, they die shortly after.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.460 align:middle line:90%
But that's inconclusive.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.807 align:middle line:84%
That was just where
it was left with me.

00:25:39.807 --> 00:25:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do we know anything
about what these beings are

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.962 align:middle line:90%
called or where they're from?

00:25:43.962 --> 00:25:46.261 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:25:46.261 --> 00:25:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But you
can't say, or can you?

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So it's
really bizarre to me

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:56.140 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand, how do
you get an organic craft that

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.790 align:middle line:90%
looks like the body?

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:02.170 align:middle line:84%
If people didn't have
the respect for you

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.990 align:middle line:84%
that they had in
previous episodes,

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:08.131 align:middle line:84%
this whole thing might sound
completely, totally ridiculous.

00:26:08.131 --> 00:26:10.630 align:middle line:84%
But yet, on the other hand, the
way you answer my questions,

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.580 align:middle line:84%
I always use
forensic techniques.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.850 align:middle line:84%
I jump around, and I ask
really specific details,

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:17.560 align:middle line:90%
and you don't miss a beat.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very strange
thing we're talking about.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:22.630 align:middle line:90%
So the craft are made in space.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:25.750 align:middle line:84%
They're made by harmonics,
and frequency, and sound.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And they are also just like,
say, for example, your own pet.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is, you
have a good conscious connection

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.720 align:middle line:90%
with this craft.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Lots of craft can be
made from your own DNA,

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.300 align:middle line:84%
have a piece of your
DNA in it, and that

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:47.620 align:middle line:84%
allows you to consciously
assist with the consciousness,

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.300 align:middle line:84%
speak to the craft
telepathically,

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:84%
and also move the craft
without doing anything.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:58.520 align:middle line:84%
The cells on those
craft are living cells.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And without getting too far into
the physics and science that

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:07.520 align:middle line:84%
doesn't exist yet, which
will sound a little crazy,

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:12.160 align:middle line:84%
those cells have
micro nanoparticles

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:16.030 align:middle line:90%
of computer technology in them.

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:17.440 align:middle line:90%
They can store energy.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking on
a super nano level.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.350 align:middle line:90%
Very, very small.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.280 align:middle line:84%
The cells themselves,
like, one day

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.610 align:middle line:84%
you asked me, how the
heck do these cells

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:31.550 align:middle line:84%
or these synthetic cells
work like the mitochondria?

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of hesitant
to really tell you,

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.920 align:middle line:84%
but they're like micro
capacitors inside these cells

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.450 align:middle line:84%
that self-regulate,
so the whole body,

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and every cell in that craft,
is actually speaking to itself.

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And I think you
had said at one point

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.860 align:middle line:84%
that, in some cases, it's
like a hexagonal matrix?

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:51.660 align:middle line:90%
Like a honeycomb?

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The scaffold is
sometimes like a hexagon,

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:56.470 align:middle line:90%
like a honeycomb.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:28:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And that allows cells to go
in there, and grow into there,

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.830 align:middle line:90%
and be happy.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:06.010 align:middle line:84%
But that scaffold,
also, is the whole part

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:08.590 align:middle line:84%
of the craft that allows
the craft to communicate

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.510 align:middle line:90%
with the cells and the user.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:13.576 align:middle line:90%


00:28:13.576 --> 00:28:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you're saying that
they can grow a craft in space?

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And how
prevalent do you

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:24.480 align:middle line:84%
think this is amongst
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.610 align:middle line:84%
that are advanced
enough to travel here?

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think
it's a common thing.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.870 align:middle line:84%
They learned how to produce
gravity, a gravitational field.

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.850 align:middle line:84%
An electromagnetic
field that envelops

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:40.890 align:middle line:84%
the craft and the
person, so they

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:44.710 align:middle line:84%
have their own atmosphere,
and their own gravity.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they can
go a million miles an hour

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and turn at a 90-degree
turn, because they're

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:52.650 align:middle line:84%
in their own
gravitational force that

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:56.565 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to do with a planet
or anything else around them.

00:28:56.565 --> 00:28:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I guess one
of the things that--

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:02.820 align:middle line:84%
if we're going to really
get speculative here--

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:07.010 align:middle line:84%
people might wonder, if the
craft would become sentient

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and then perhaps turn on
its owner at some point,

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:12.140 align:middle line:90%
if it wasn't feeling respected?

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.110 align:middle line:84%
If there could be some danger
in having a being with free will

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:16.940 align:middle line:90%
that is your spaceship?

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: This is where it
gets really interesting.

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:22.430 align:middle line:90%
The craft is you.

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:24.590 align:middle line:90%
So you are the craft.

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you are suicidal, then
the craft will be suicidal.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.655 align:middle line:84%
If you are having a good
time, then the craft

00:29:32.655 --> 00:29:33.920 align:middle line:90%
is going to be happy too.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And it feels this
way on a craft.

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:39.290 align:middle line:84%
You can actually feel
this back and forth.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:44.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not operating really on
its own as much as you think.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:48.920 align:middle line:84%
It is its own
sentient, but it only

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:53.720 align:middle line:84%
feels your emotion,
which is really neat.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.320 align:middle line:84%
I've been on craft
before where I felt like,

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.800 align:middle line:84%
the best way I
could put it is, I

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.480 align:middle line:84%
felt like it was my
pet dog, because it

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:06.260 align:middle line:84%
was just so funny, and
cuddly, and hilarious.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, it was
very obedient like a dog.

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.500 align:middle line:84%
It would never
turn on its owner.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Although some dogs do, you
know what I'm getting at.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting at that
point where it's

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:23.380 align:middle line:84%
a very beautiful connection
between the beings

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.660 align:middle line:90%
and their craft.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well it
would make sense

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:27.150 align:middle line:84%
you would want to design it
that way, so it was safe.

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.228 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to program it
not to bite me anymore.

00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:32.310 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, Emery, I want to
thank you for being here.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.081 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank
you for watching.

00:30:36.081 --> 00:30:37.390 align:middle line:90%
This is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:40.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, David Wilcock,
here with our special guest,

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Emery Smith, talking
about organic spacecraft.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.790 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.
