00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY WEIDNER: Hi, everybody.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.290 align:middle line:10%
You're watching
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.090 align:middle line:10%
My name is Jay
Weidner, and we are

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.930 align:middle line:10%
carrying on our conversation
with Mr. Jason Rice.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.200 align:middle line:10%
Mr. Rice, how are you?

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.330 align:middle line:10%
>> JASON RICE: I'm
doing fantastic, Jay.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.620 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for having me again.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.580 align:middle line:10%
>> JAY: Yeah, it's
been a real pleasure.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.240 align:middle line:84%
So what parting gifts
did you receive when you

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.258 align:middle line:90%
left the Secret Space Program?

00:00:38.258 --> 00:00:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Well, first let's get
into a little bit about what I

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.640 align:middle line:90%
consider to be parting gifts.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.570 align:middle line:84%
The self-destructive
behaviors, or distractions,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:84%
or the neural diversions that
are programmed in upon exit

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.560 align:middle line:84%
from the Secret Space Program so
that the secrets remain secret.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So they customize these
based on the individual.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.590 align:middle line:90%
So if an individual has--

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:84%
through the extensive
research that they've done--

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.970 align:middle line:84%
has a propensity or a potential
for a gambling addiction,

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.580 align:middle line:84%
then that particular parting
gift is triggered when they

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.190 align:middle line:84%
reach a point in which
either they're comfortable

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and they can start
exploring more spirituality,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.860 align:middle line:84%
deeper questions,
the why am I doing

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.430 align:middle line:84%
this, the what does that
particular memory mean.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.290 align:middle line:90%
So that's when these kick in.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So it could be anything
from a gambling addiction,

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:84%
to an alcohol or
drug abuse problem,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.210 align:middle line:90%
to any social disorder--

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.210 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you name it.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.410 align:middle line:84%
There is an entire
genetic sequence

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.150 align:middle line:84%
to pick from for disorders
that they can use.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
have to choose one.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.870 align:middle line:84%
They can stack them up so that
there are multiple backups

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.860 align:middle line:84%
to keep a person so
distracted and so diverted

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.940 align:middle line:84%
that they never get around
to asking those questions.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: This isn't
much of a parting gift.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: No, it's not, which
is why I say it in jest.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Was there anything
that the SSP gave you that is

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.980 align:middle line:90%
positive?

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: There were a number of
years of experiences in which

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.880 align:middle line:84%
you share a lot of
laughs, and warmth,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and compassion with any number
of people that we had helped

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.970 align:middle line:90%
or that had helped us.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And so it wasn't 20 years
of darkness by any means.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.900 align:middle line:84%
There were ups
and downs as you'd

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.430 align:middle line:90%
find in any conventional life.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.890 align:middle line:84%
There certainly
were moments that

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:84%
were beyond what anyone would
want to go through, or see,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.790 align:middle line:90%
or experience.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.200 align:middle line:84%
But there were also a lot of
moments of joy and happiness.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think carrying and
carrying those moments through

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.370 align:middle line:84%
and recalling those, more
so than the dark moments,

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:84%
has been one of the
extremely beneficially

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.660 align:middle line:84%
helpful and healing
methods for me

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.990 align:middle line:84%
to use in recalling my
career return experience.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So how did all of this
affect your life after you got

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.480 align:middle line:90%
back?

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Not having a context
to place the night terrors,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.030 align:middle line:84%
or the PTSD, or the depression,
and not having a context

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.740 align:middle line:84%
for which that was
for was a very,

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.570 align:middle line:84%
very challenging
time in my life.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.550 align:middle line:84%
When I first returned
and had these issues,

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.170 align:middle line:90%
and it was a puzzle why.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle line:84%
That was the biggest
question-- why?

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.110 align:middle line:90%
What for?

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Did you seek
out psychiatric help?

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Oh, yes.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: You did?

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes, I did.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: And what did they say?

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: They had labeled it
as something that was genetic.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.730 align:middle line:90%
And so I was like, OK.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.360 align:middle line:84%
All right, well, you know what,
I'm going to go about my life.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And in spite of this,
I'm going to make sure

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.550 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to do my best
to be happy every single day,

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.400 align:middle line:84%
and be productive, and
to have a life that I

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.430 align:middle line:84%
am proud, and happy,
and joyful about living.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So when our troops
come home from like Iraq

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.290 align:middle line:84%
or Afghanistan, they're
pretty messed up.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Sure.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: I have friends that
came home from Vietnam and never

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.120 align:middle line:90%
recovered.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Sure.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Turned to
heroin, alcohol,

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.140 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of terrible things.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.190 align:middle line:90%
Some recovered.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.638 align:middle line:84%
Some-- it took 10 years,
but they recovered.

00:05:02.638 --> 00:05:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Did you have anything
like that or do

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.013 align:middle line:84%
you know anyone that
had anything like that?

00:05:06.013 --> 00:05:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Well, I can tell
you that seeing news stories

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and reading about people
that have come back,

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.320 align:middle line:84%
and just the sheer number of
suicides each day from soldiers

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.680 align:middle line:84%
that have come back and are
having to deal with the issues

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:84%
that they've carried with them,
and not all wounds are visible.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And getting the
professional help

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.280 align:middle line:84%
is certainly a
tremendously big step.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Not identifying it as
something that is taboo,

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:42.560 align:middle line:84%
not labeling these people
as in a group that's either

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:84%
unreachable, or accepting and
acknowledging that there are

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.710 align:middle line:90%
issues out there.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And the soldiers that come
back from overseas deployments

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of the same
issues when they get back.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.330 align:middle line:84%
The mental health
issues, and dealing

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.650 align:middle line:84%
with being thrown
into normal society

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.110 align:middle line:84%
where the backfiring of a car
sends them diving into a ditch.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.978 align:middle line:84%
It's an adjustment and it
doesn't happen overnight.

00:06:13.978 --> 00:06:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: No, it takes years
for someone with PTSD.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: It takes
awhile to happen.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And the acceptance by the public
and not shunning these people

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.120 align:middle line:84%
is, I think, probably one
of the biggest things that's

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.860 align:middle line:84%
going to be and it is helpful
for acknowledging that these

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.680 align:middle line:90%
are legitimate issues.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.160 align:middle line:84%
The soldiers that
are coming back

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.960 align:middle line:84%
from overseas, the benefits
that they have in their shared

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.870 align:middle line:84%
camaraderie is that
they have people

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.960 align:middle line:84%
that they can talk to about
their shared experiences.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.600 align:middle line:84%
They have a context
in which they

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.490 align:middle line:84%
can frame the
issues that they're

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:84%
dealing with after coming
back and returning.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, those who've
served in the SSP, the veterans

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:03.800 align:middle line:84%
from the SSP programs, because
of the neural diversions that

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.680 align:middle line:84%
have occurred, we
don't have that.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we
don't have a context

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:15.450 align:middle line:84%
at first, because of the memory
clearings that have happened.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And so on a cellular
or a base level

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.580 align:middle line:84%
these traumas are
still there and we

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.960 align:middle line:90%
have no context for them.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And so it ends up being
a world that's spinning

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.652 align:middle line:90%
and there's not really a north.

00:07:31.652 --> 00:07:32.735 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: There's no anchor.

00:07:32.735 --> 00:07:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: There's
no anchor for it.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And so it relies
on the individual

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:44.030 align:middle line:84%
to find something that
can ground them, find

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.650 align:middle line:84%
their own anchor, find their
own baseline in which they can

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:53.430 align:middle line:84%
start creating and
forming a new life that

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.420 align:middle line:84%
deals with the
traumas and doesn't

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:02.208 align:middle line:84%
seek self-destructive behaviors
to solve it or to run away.

00:08:02.208 --> 00:08:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Well, if you had a
chance to talk to the people

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.740 align:middle line:84%
that are running the SSP,
what would you suggest they do

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.282 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
this is alleviated?

00:08:09.282 --> 00:08:10.082 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Stop it.

00:08:10.082 --> 00:08:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Because it's not fair.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: It's not fair.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.690 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely not fair and
it's not part of the deal.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.200 align:middle line:84%
I know I never agreed
to a neural wipe.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
that that's probably

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.810 align:middle line:84%
one of the things
that's of the largest

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.310 align:middle line:84%
detriment to an individual
that they can do.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Let's talk
about that for a second.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.220 align:middle line:90%
What is a neural wipe?

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.549 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: It is segmenting
off all of the memories from

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:38.610 align:middle line:84%
the time that they've spent
in the Career Return Program

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.169 align:middle line:84%
or any of the other
programs that are out there,

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:43.740 align:middle line:90%
so that they are not recalled.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.278 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Do you have any
idea how they do this?

00:08:46.278 --> 00:08:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: They do it through
a combination of technology

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.040 align:middle line:90%
and psychology.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.950 align:middle line:84%
The process starts
from the first day

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
establish the baseline.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
that previously.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And being able to establish
the part on the tape

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.580 align:middle line:84%
where the recording starts to
being able to go back to that.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And it involves a
combination of hypnosis,

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:13.450 align:middle line:90%
technology, pharmaceuticals.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a number
of players that are

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.260 align:middle line:90%
involved with making it happen.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: This memory wipe routine
seems to work for a while,

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.600 align:middle line:90%
but not forever.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.090 align:middle line:84%
In your case, you began
getting memories back.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.350 align:middle line:90%
Why do you think this is?

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Why isn't it perfected?

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Well, that's a
question I've asked myself many,

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.280 align:middle line:90%
many times.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.470 align:middle line:84%
The explanation that
I've come up with

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:43.560 align:middle line:84%
based on my own experiences
has to do with the cycles that

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.720 align:middle line:84%
are associated with not
specifically 20 years,

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:55.230 align:middle line:90%
but more particularly 21 years.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Because the human body
energetically and physically

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:84%
will change about
every seven years.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the 20-year mark
is the preparatory phase

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:90%
for that 21-year.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's not always seven years.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:21.270 align:middle line:84%
So 20 years marks a third phase
change within the human body,

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.520 align:middle line:84%
both physically
and energetically.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think because of the
way that memories are formed

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and the way that they
are segmented off,

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:90%
the brain creates memories--

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:84%
and the way that
I envision it is

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:43.020 align:middle line:84%
that it's created in a whole
host of places physically

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.660 align:middle line:90%
within the brain.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And that those places
have other memories

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.160 align:middle line:90%
that are put right next to it.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And so you'll have
sections of the brain that

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.200 align:middle line:84%
may have memories from when
you were eight years old,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and also memories from
when you were 16 years old,

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and memories from
when you were 23.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And so as those areas
get used more and more,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:18.900 align:middle line:84%
the energies associated after
20 years start, for some reason,

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.060 align:middle line:90%
shaking things loose.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you that it didn't
start at the 20-year mark.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.540 align:middle line:84%
It started almost immediately,
but I had no context for it.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.840 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, that was
really strange, very bizarre,

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.210 align:middle line:84%
terrifying, and
I'm going to forget

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.770 align:middle line:84%
that I ever thought of that
and go about my daily business.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not like it
all started just one day,

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:45.690 align:middle line:84%
I woke up and had
these memories.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.140 align:middle line:84%
No, it had slowly
progressed where

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:84%
at first there were a number of
things and then it went away.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And then a few years later,
there was something else.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe five years
later, there was something else.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe four years
later, there was something else.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the frequencies in
which they started coming back

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.690 align:middle line:90%
increased as time went on.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And what that did was it helped
to put together the fuller

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.960 align:middle line:84%
picture for, OK, what
did they really mean?

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And once you start
obtaining a context for what

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.300 align:middle line:84%
these various
memories pertain to,

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.390 align:middle line:84%
then you're better
able to determine what

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.030 align:middle line:90%
it was that you're remembering.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: You start comparing
memories to each other and then

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.010 align:middle line:84%
you begin extrapolating
a story of some kind.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.015 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: That's correct.

00:12:36.015 --> 00:12:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, unfortunately, not
having a fellow soldier

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.470 align:middle line:84%
from the same unit to
discuss things with and, hey,

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.470 align:middle line:84%
do you remember we were
sitting around the table

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.800 align:middle line:84%
at this little
tavern on Callidus 3

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and we were having
a conversation.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I had nobody to do that with and
there was nobody that I could--

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.350 align:middle line:84%
that I knew and
which I could have

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.210 align:middle line:84%
a conversation
about my experiences

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.550 align:middle line:90%
on some faraway planet.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And so what it meant was I had
to develop my own techniques

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:10.590 align:middle line:90%
and my own methods for coping.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was so
monumentally important

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.880 align:middle line:84%
for me personally to be able
to thank God for the process,

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.430 align:middle line:84%
being very thankful for
my family and the support

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.040 align:middle line:84%
that I received from
them, and that I really

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.310 align:middle line:84%
wasn't going crazy,
and that these

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:35.080 align:middle line:84%
were real and genuine events
that I was having to relive.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And in order for me to
maintain and keep my sanity,

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.790 align:middle line:90%
being able to express them.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of experiencers that
have come forward, many of them

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:52.050 align:middle line:90%
are just seeking help with it.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.010 align:middle line:84%
They're not looking
for fame and fortune

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.850 align:middle line:84%
or to spread information about
what they've been through.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.948 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are
just looking for help,

00:13:59.948 --> 00:14:01.990 align:middle line:84%
in the same way that
soldiers when they come back

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and they need mental
health issues that they

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:07.240 align:middle line:90%
need help with--

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.490 align:middle line:90%
they're seeking help.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Have you ever had
anybody from the military

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:17.560 align:middle line:84%
or the government overtly
or covertly contact you?

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: No.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.410 align:middle line:84%
I've had friends that
I was in the service

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:24.550 align:middle line:84%
with that I've contacted and
nothing ever even remotely

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:25.990 align:middle line:90%
close to this has come up.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Do you think
you're being monitored?

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:28.305 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: I know I am.

00:14:28.305 --> 00:14:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: You are.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.750 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel you're
being monitored?

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:10%
>> RICE: I feel I'm being
monitored because I've had

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:39.430 align:middle line:10%
a number of very bizarre
computer and phone issues that

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.330 align:middle line:10%
have only started
happening in the last year.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:44.980 align:middle line:90%
It's enough to pay attention to.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Somebody
wants you to notice.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Somebody definitely
wants me to notice.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Have you ever been
instructed by anyone to tell us

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.160 align:middle line:84%
anything specifically
on this show?

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: No, I have not.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Is there a way
for someone to know

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.110 align:middle line:84%
if they're being
recruited by the SSP?

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: I'd say that if a
person has felt different

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:12.430 align:middle line:84%
enough from their peers that
they recognize number one,

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:84%
that they are picking
up on things that people

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.610 align:middle line:84%
aren't saying, that they're
picking up on things before

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:23.530 align:middle line:84%
they happen, that there
has been some pre-cog

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:31.390 align:middle line:84%
in their experiences, and that
suddenly they have a recruiter,

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:38.470 align:middle line:84%
or a family friend, or someone
that works for a three-letter

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:43.210 align:middle line:84%
agency, or the government, or
the military that has started

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:47.290 align:middle line:84%
paying attention to
them and their progress.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:51.340 align:middle line:84%
That is probably
a good indicator

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.290 align:middle line:90%
that they're being scouted.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: What about getting weird
tests at school and things,

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.340 align:middle line:90%
like you got?

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: I would say that that's
also another good indicator.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, some of
the standardized tests

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:07.660 align:middle line:84%
that everybody receives includes
some of those indicators built

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.750 align:middle line:90%
into it.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:12.100 align:middle line:84%
So they may be tested for
it and not even know it.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So some viewers after
watching your past episodes are

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.890 align:middle line:84%
starting to have their
memories rekindled.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.860 align:middle line:84%
How can we tell between
implanted memories

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.030 align:middle line:90%
and real memories?

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: I've received messages
myself from a number of people

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.540 align:middle line:84%
from around the world of
memories that they've started

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:36.550 align:middle line:84%
having in which there's been
recollection of activities

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.830 align:middle line:84%
off-planet or during
a combat operation.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there's
a number of categories

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:46.900 align:middle line:90%
that they could be.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.220 align:middle line:84%
They could be
memories returning.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:53.690 align:middle line:84%
They could be tapping into a
global consciousness in which

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:84%
they're accessing
the Akashic records

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.140 align:middle line:90%
and pulling those memories.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:06.400 align:middle line:84%
There could be a tying into
some remote information

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.290 align:middle line:90%
from someone else.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:13.609 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of factors
that are possibly at play.

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think as
more people awaken,

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:22.000 align:middle line:84%
there will only be a growing
number of those happening.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: There seems to be like
a spreading mental illness going

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:90%
on in our world right now.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering
if a lot of this

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:34.360 align:middle line:84%
isn't people that were in
the Secret Space Program who

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.160 align:middle line:84%
have really faulty memories
because of the mind

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.130 align:middle line:90%
wipe going crazy.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Mm-hmm.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Is that possible?

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.700 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Well, it's
absolutely possible.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.870 align:middle line:84%
The other factor to
consider is that there

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:55.740 align:middle line:84%
has been a global brainwashing
operation in effect and ongoing

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.790 align:middle line:90%
for decades.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Mainstream advertisers,
sports, movies, music videos--

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the full list of it.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And what we don't
know are what are

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.790 align:middle line:90%
the long-term effects of that?

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:84%
What happens when people
wake up and completely

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.885 align:middle line:84%
reject everything that they've
been brainwashed to believe?

00:18:17.885 --> 00:18:19.010 align:middle line:90%
What happens to the person?

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.840 align:middle line:90%
What happens to their sanity?

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: I don't know, but I
think we're about to find out.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: It certainly
seems that way.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: You're walking
down the street,

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and a nice woman walks up to
you with her 10-year-old boy,

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.580 align:middle line:84%
and she says, I've been
watching your show,

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and I want my son here to
join the Secret Space Program

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and learn all the
things that you learned.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:41.960 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: I would say, absolutely
don't allow it to happen,

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.710 align:middle line:84%
if you have anything
to do with it at all.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Why?

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: The problem with
anything that has "secret"

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:55.600 align:middle line:84%
in the name is the non-informed
consent that comes along with

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.050 align:middle line:90%
getting involved with it.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And that there are a lot
of parts and small print

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:04.160 align:middle line:84%
that you won't find
out about for decades.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Do you feel personally,
karmically responsible for what

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:90%
you did?

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Absolutely.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.560 align:middle line:84%
I do feel that there is some
personal karmic involvement

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.670 align:middle line:90%
in that.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Even though the thousands
of us that were involved

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.780 align:middle line:84%
weren't aware of it, there
is still a responsibility

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.300 align:middle line:90%
with being involved.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And there is an even
greater responsibility

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:32.140 align:middle line:84%
to the human race, because where
one of us is involved with it,

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:37.090 align:middle line:84%
there is, I believe, a
connection to all of us.

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And that as a race,
at some point in time,

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:42.360 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have
to correct that.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: So do you still have
sporadic memories that are

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.750 align:middle line:84%
unhinged from your
narrative that you still

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:51.660 align:middle line:90%
don't understand?

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: No.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.250 align:middle line:84%
The memories that
come back now because

00:19:55.250 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:84%
of just the amount of them,
the good thing about that

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:07.860 align:middle line:84%
is that it has provided
the outline blueprint

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.380 align:middle line:90%
border for what has happened.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very thankful that the
things that I have remembered

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:23.160 align:middle line:84%
have fallen into place
within the contexts of that

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.950 align:middle line:84%
experience-- my career
return experience.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And so it's no longer a left
field, gosh, what in the world

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.830 align:middle line:90%
was that about kind of thing.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:36.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like, all right,
now I understand.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.870 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I had
a memory recollection

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:47.750 align:middle line:84%
that was the end of
a particular training

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:51.390 align:middle line:90%
exercise that came back first.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:53.340 align:middle line:90%
And I had no context for it.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And then a couple
of months later,

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.540 align:middle line:84%
I had the beginning portions
of that memory return.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And then it click, click, click,
click, it fell into place.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And so the memories
that come back

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.000 align:middle line:84%
fall into place very
similar to that.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And that one, in particular,
was one that I was like, OK.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And so now I have a
precedent in which

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:18.990 align:middle line:84%
to say, OK, it may not
make complete sense,

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:84%
but there's a part of
it that I do understand,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.820 align:middle line:84%
and I have complete
faith that the rest of it

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.647 align:middle line:84%
will fall into
place at some point.

00:21:25.647 --> 00:21:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Has someone reached out
to you or have you reached out

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:31.690 align:middle line:84%
to someone else to
provide support?

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: I have.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And there are a number
of support groups online

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.750 align:middle line:84%
and a number of them communicate
with me back and forth

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:40.780 align:middle line:90%
via Twitter.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And if there are those out there
that have questions or have

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:47.430 align:middle line:84%
their own questions
about it, it's

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:52.590 align:middle line:84%
not that hard to find
those that are experiencers

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:56.690 align:middle line:84%
and that do have support groups
in which they communicate.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of
them out there already

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:04.470 align:middle line:84%
that have chosen not to come
forward really publicly,

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.630 align:middle line:84%
but they are out
there in which they're

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.450 align:middle line:84%
willing to share
and help others.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.405 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: If you had the choice
to do this all over again,

00:22:12.405 --> 00:22:15.090 align:middle line:84%
and it was your choice,
what would you do?

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:18.708 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.708 --> 00:22:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: That's a
good question, Jay.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that given
the choice between having

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:30.600 align:middle line:84%
to relive the trauma again,
knowing the effect that it's

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.110 align:middle line:84%
had on me, especially
over the last 20 years,

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I would
make the same choice.

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:43.080 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
I'm not who I am today

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:47.080 align:middle line:84%
and wouldn't be who I am today
without those experiences.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: True.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: So that paradox
itself is something I'm glad I

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.860 align:middle line:84%
don't have to make
that choice again.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:01.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm also glad that I don't
have to go through it again.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:04.860 align:middle line:84%
But that's an
interesting question.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: I imagine there are some
people that are faking it out

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.700 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.370 align:middle line:84%
How do you tell the difference
between someone who was really

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.820 align:middle line:84%
in the SSP, and someone who just
thinks they were in or is just

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:15.860 align:middle line:90%
making it up?

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: There are a lot of
people out there that have

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.860 align:middle line:90%
an interest in the SSP.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there are
those out there that

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.720 align:middle line:84%
have embraced the
story that they want

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.890 align:middle line:84%
to participate in
it in a way in which

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.110 align:middle line:90%
may not be completely honest.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And it also may
be that they truly

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:36.930 align:middle line:84%
believe that they were
involved in some way, one

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.250 align:middle line:90%
way or another.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
discerning whether or not

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:49.650 align:middle line:84%
someone has been in the SSP,
my own personal approach is

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:53.535 align:middle line:84%
to provide the benefit
of the doubt first,

00:23:53.535 --> 00:23:57.060 align:middle line:90%
and without passing judgment.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:02.890 align:middle line:84%
I think that
someone's motivations

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:05.380 align:middle line:90%
become known over time.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And whether or not
they're seeking

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:84%
attention, or camaraderie,
or answers, or fame,

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:19.570 align:middle line:84%
or any number of things,
that information comes out.

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:21.030 align:middle line:90%
And you'll find out.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Eventually.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Eventually.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:23.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say that from
a compassionate standpoint,

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.830 align:middle line:84%
my approach has
always been to provide

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.720 align:middle line:90%
the benefit of the doubt first.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not in the business
of being judgmental.

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm also not a
professional therapist.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And providing an
ear is one thing,

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:50.620 align:middle line:84%
and recounting my own
experiences and maybe

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:54.370 align:middle line:84%
the things that
have helped me, I'm

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:57.950 align:middle line:84%
absolutely happy and
100% willing to do that.

00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:59.710 align:middle line:90%
So I think there's--

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: No one really
owns this thing.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: No, not at all.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.640 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:09.550 align:middle line:84%
There's a wide range of
programs, and SSP projects,

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.950 align:middle line:84%
and operations out
there, and that there

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:13.120 align:middle line:90%
are thousands of people--

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Literally,
have to be thousands.

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: --thousands
that have been involved.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And to this claim that you know
all the programs and operations

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.060 align:middle line:84%
and every person that's
been involved in them,

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:30.340 align:middle line:84%
I think is not being completely
honest with yourself, because

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.810 align:middle line:90%
of compartmentalization.

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And that there's
no way to know it.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: I doubt if even a
five-star general could tell

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.540 align:middle line:84%
you every department
inside of their own segment

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:39.340 align:middle line:90%
of the military.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: No.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: I suppose it's possible
for a remote viewer to take

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:49.120 align:middle line:84%
their astral body out into
space and see the Secret Space

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.122 align:middle line:90%
Program stuff.

00:25:50.122 --> 00:25:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Would you say that's
a possibility?

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Sure.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I'd take it
a little step further.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Souls aren't always
in one place.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:02.380 align:middle line:84%
You may have a part
of your soul that

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.460 align:middle line:84%
exists on another dimension,
or in another place,

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.860 align:middle line:90%
or in another body.

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And so a person could very
possibly, quite potentially,

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:16.750 align:middle line:84%
especially, if they're
of the same soul,

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.600 align:middle line:84%
they could see the
other part of their soul

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.410 align:middle line:84%
which happens to be in
a Secret Space Program,

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:27.550 align:middle line:84%
and see what that other
part of themself is doing.

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Because they would share a
very, very strong connection

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.100 align:middle line:90%
to the other part of their soul.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's absolutely
quite possible

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.550 align:middle line:84%
that a person that is not
associated in any means, way,

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:42.970 align:middle line:84%
or form with the
SSP, could be remote

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:47.440 align:middle line:84%
viewing another
part of their soul

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.680 align:middle line:90%
that is involved with the SSP.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Are there any tools that
a former SSP survivor can go

00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:00.400 align:middle line:84%
to or resort to to help them as
they go through the transition

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.140 align:middle line:90%
to remembering everything?

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Absolutely.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And I would say the first tool
to use is to don't rush it.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And don't expect it
to happen overnight.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:15.370 align:middle line:84%
There includes a
whole host of things.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:18.710 align:middle line:84%
First off, if you are
seeking to try and find

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:25.760 align:middle line:84%
a professional mental health
counselor to go to, to find one

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:84%
that is open to discussing
the Secret Space Program.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Did you find
a person like that?

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: I did not, but I
wasn't searching for one.

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:40.610 align:middle line:84%
I have found references for
those that are willing to help

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:43.580 align:middle line:90%
and that do fit that category.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And finding one doesn't
have to be local.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.940 align:middle line:84%
You can do it by
phone, or by Skype,

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.670 align:middle line:84%
or by Zoom, or any
number of tools

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:56.060 align:middle line:84%
that are available for
doing it using technology.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that could be
used is the hypnotic regression.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that Georgina
Cannon is a fantastic person

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:07.820 align:middle line:90%
to go to.

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:11.330 align:middle line:84%
There are others that are
available that would be willing

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:14.118 align:middle line:84%
and are extremely
helpful in doing that.

00:28:14.118 --> 00:28:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Have you ever come
across anyone that you

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.910 align:middle line:84%
recognize as being part
of your SSP experience?

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: In fact, I was recently
asked by someone if I saw

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.600 align:middle line:84%
someone, for instance, in the
line at the grocery store that

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.530 align:middle line:84%
I recognized, would I walk
up to them and say something?

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:37.540 align:middle line:84%
I have not seen someone
that was awakened

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:39.820 align:middle line:90%
that was in the SSP program.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:43.090 align:middle line:84%
I have seen others
that were involved,

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.857 align:middle line:84%
but I don't believe they
were awakened to that.

00:28:45.857 --> 00:28:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And you don't
want to be the--

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.357 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: And I'm not--

00:28:48.357 --> 00:28:51.100 align:middle line:90%
it's not my part to play.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.420 align:middle line:90%
That's not my job.

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:56.080 align:middle line:84%
That's the individual's
right to determine whether A,

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.880 align:middle line:84%
they want to wake up to
that, or B, if they're ready.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: And if
someone was awake,

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:03.370 align:middle line:84%
would you be OK if
they came to you?

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Absolutely.

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: You're working for
this nefarious organization who

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.830 align:middle line:84%
really doesn't have to go
through all the trouble

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.120 align:middle line:90%
of sending you back--

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.270 align:middle line:84%
all the energy it takes
and the money it takes--

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:21.720 align:middle line:84%
when really for about $0.40
they could get rid of you.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Sure.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>> JAY: Why do they do this?

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Something I'd ask
myself when I transferred

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:29.820 align:middle line:90%
into the training unit.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And that was a period of time
during my career of return

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:37.950 align:middle line:84%
in which I had probably the
most questions answered as well

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:39.450 align:middle line:90%
as generated.

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I found out
why they didn't just space us,

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.440 align:middle line:84%
or get rid of us, or do away
with some pesky question

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:53.100 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the day, was that
they had signed agreements,

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.830 align:middle line:84%
in order to use
certain technologies,

00:29:55.830 --> 00:30:01.980 align:middle line:84%
that they would do this and
that they wouldn't willfully

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:08.167 align:middle line:84%
terminate a person's
life to get rid of them.

00:30:08.167 --> 00:30:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Well, Jason, it's been
a real pleasure talking to you.

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:11.947 align:middle line:90%
I want to thank you.

00:30:11.947 --> 00:30:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Thank you
for having me, Jay.

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:15.487 align:middle line:84%
This is all about
full disclosure.

00:30:15.487 --> 00:30:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: Well, we can
only hope, right?

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:17.987 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: That's right.

00:30:17.987 --> 00:30:20.028 align:middle line:84%
>> JAY: You've been watching
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:30:20.028 --> 00:30:21.000 align:middle line:90%
My name is Jay Weidner.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank
you for watching.
