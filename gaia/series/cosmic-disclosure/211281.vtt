00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.140 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure"
we're with Randy Cramer,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.650 align:middle line:10%
who has participated in a covert
military space program for 18

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.080 align:middle line:10%
years called the
Earth Defense Force.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are talking
about widespread disclosure

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:90%
and how to prepare for it.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.998 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:34.998 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me, Emery.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So what does disclosure look
like from your perspective?

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Alien invasion,
post-invasion reconstruction.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Why that?

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Apparently, the discussion
around the big table,

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.410 align:middle line:84%
as I often refer to it,
was we got to do something.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Do we want to do a "take
me to your leader" plan?

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Or do we want to do
an invasion plan.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And as much as it sounds nice
to do a "take me to your leader"

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.140 align:middle line:84%
plan, there's tons of
logistical problems with that.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it has to do with
the acceptance from people

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.700 align:middle line:90%
who--

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.750 align:middle line:84%
let's just say that their
traditional worldviews would

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.970 align:middle line:90%
be shattered by such an event.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.130 align:middle line:84%
So that brought us to,
well, what about an invasion

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.250 align:middle line:84%
scenario, which
is less of a, hey,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:84%
would you like some
extraterrestrials

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.150 align:middle line:84%
with your life, which is the
"take me to your leader" plan.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.470 align:middle line:90%
As we go, no, I don't want that.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Take that away--
versus invasion.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.310 align:middle line:84%
You're taking the aliens
now, and you're going

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:90%
to have them in your life now.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.520 align:middle line:90%
No backsies.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And then that's just
what we've got there.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>> And who is offering this?

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Like, is this something
you've heard on your own

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.060 align:middle line:84%
from other
extraterrestrial species?

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Or is this something that's
preprogrammed here on Earth?

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to be something
that is programmed

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:90%
into our genetics.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.889 align:middle line:84%
Like, we've been genetically
predisposed to wait for someone

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.170 align:middle line:84%
to come back, or
who was here before.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Or wait for someone to
show up and say, OK, I'm

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.050 align:middle line:84%
here to walk you through
the next part of this.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you aware of
this happening to other

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.470 align:middle line:90%
civilizations in the past?

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.180 align:middle line:90%
Or has it been mentioned to you?

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.050 align:middle line:90%
That's a common pattern.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.910 align:middle line:90%
It's like out of the handbook.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.500 align:middle line:84%
If your job is to help species
move through this stuff

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.410 align:middle line:84%
when they're in early primitive
stages, part of the handbook

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.000 align:middle line:90%
is, all right, let's see.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.490 align:middle line:84%
How do you-- how
to show up as a God

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and give instructions
to a primitive people.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:90%
Step 1, 2, 3.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And do they look at the
casualties as implemented

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.070 align:middle line:84%
as a plus or minus in the
situation because of all

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:90%
the changes that would happen?

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Sadly, at least I
think it's a little sadly,

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.880 align:middle line:84%
most of the time life,
death, losses are seen

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.890 align:middle line:84%
as the inevitability of
if you raise chickens,

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:90%
you're going to lose some.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:84%
If you grow corn, you're
going to lose some.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
the ones that get lost

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:84%
are seen as natural
Darwinistic order

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.290 align:middle line:84%
in that sense, which
when we get to more

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.450 align:middle line:84%
civilized ways of
being, that has

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.130 align:middle line:90%
to go behind us a little bit.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.560 align:middle line:84%
But in a lot of that
developing process

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.880 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of survival
of the fittest involved.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are intelligences
here on the planet that know

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.670 align:middle line:84%
about this alien
invasion protocol.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.420 align:middle line:84%
But wouldn't that
go against really--

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.000 align:middle line:84%
because it would be a chaotic
situation, and how would

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.230 align:middle line:90%
people accept that?

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>> It actually turns out
that psychologically,

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.610 align:middle line:84%
people come into a greater sense
of acceptance from that chaotic

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.860 align:middle line:84%
situation than they do
from a static situation.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you tried to bring in a
disclosure event 20 years ago

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.430 align:middle line:84%
when there was more
stability, you'd

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.200 align:middle line:90%
have way more resistance to it.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:84%
By having it come along when
everything is in turmoil,

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.110 align:middle line:84%
you actually have a much readier
percentage of the population.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:84%
>> So they see it as more as
a plus that it's more chaotic

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:21.279 align:middle line:90%
now--

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:90%
>> --than 20 years ago.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.530 align:middle line:84%
In this particular
case, it actually

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.180 align:middle line:84%
gets you a net win with
more people who are--

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.990 align:middle line:84%
instead of going,
no, that can't be.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.700 align:middle line:90%
It's like, sure.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:84%
What else was going
to happen next?

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.360 align:middle line:84%
The stressful events that
have been progressing one

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.760 align:middle line:84%
after the other actually
lead us to a place

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.210 align:middle line:84%
where when that big
stressful event comes along,

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.550 align:middle line:84%
it will seem much
less stressful.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Because we've been
conditioned to be living under

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.090 align:middle line:84%
stress for the
last several years.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, there are segments of
the population and Gaia viewers

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.350 align:middle line:84%
that see this disclosure
as a very peaceful time.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.230 align:middle line:10%
And then we have,
of course, the rest

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.860 align:middle line:10%
of the world that sees this
possibly as a chaotic time.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So what it turns into
is for a thoughtful,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:84%
intellectual group of people who
want to consider this subject,

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.390 align:middle line:84%
they can have the luxury
of thinking about it,

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.120 align:middle line:84%
listening to people
talk about it,

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.730 align:middle line:84%
engaging themselves in the
conversation for as many

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.670 align:middle line:84%
months, years as they want to
go along in that process to come

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.350 align:middle line:90%
to a place where they can--

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:90%
OK, I can be OK with this now.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.480 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's good
for those people.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Fabulous that those people
have given themselves

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.230 align:middle line:84%
the time and the
luxury to do that.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.730 align:middle line:84%
For everyone else who
has not done that,

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:51.280 align:middle line:84%
they are going to have
two very simple choices--

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.000 align:middle line:90%
very simple choices.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:84%
They can either be pro Terran,
or they can be pro invader.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:84%
There's only going
to be two choices.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:84%
You don't get to make any
other choice in that situation.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.232 align:middle line:84%
You don't get to hem and
haw and think about it

00:06:05.232 --> 00:06:06.940 align:middle line:84%
and decide, well,
maybe I like this part,

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.770 align:middle line:90%
but I don't like that part.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.990 align:middle line:84%
To make this very black
and white-- so you

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.090 align:middle line:84%
have the quickest path to
what we call total acceptance,

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.340 align:middle line:84%
which is really like
85% of the population.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.850 align:middle line:84%
But when we reach
85% acceptance,

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
that's considered
total acceptance,

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.280 align:middle line:90%
even if it's not 100%

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.080 align:middle line:84%
But that's the fastest
path to total acceptance

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.950 align:middle line:84%
is not giving those
people the time,

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.760 align:middle line:84%
or the intellectual process,
or the number of choices

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.050 align:middle line:84%
that would delay that,
but to simply say,

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.690 align:middle line:90%
you have two choices.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.160 align:middle line:90%
Are you pro Terran?

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Or are you pro bug invader?

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And the vast majority of
people, when given that choice,

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.380 align:middle line:90%
will go well, I'm pro Terran.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm pro human.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>> But what if they believe
only in peace and no war and no

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.160 align:middle line:90%
conflict?

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's going
to be some repercussions

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.800 align:middle line:90%
on that other end.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the truth is that we
live in a universe of conflict.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.500 align:middle line:84%
There are some very
peaceful civilizations that

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.385 align:middle line:90%
have some very peaceful places.

00:07:10.385 --> 00:07:12.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying that's not true.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.060 align:middle line:84%
But the universe at large
is a universe of chaos,

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and a universe of fighting,
and a universe of conflict

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.070 align:middle line:90%
that's happening all the time.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.540 align:middle line:90%
There's more trade.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.240 align:middle line:90%
And there's more getting along.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.190 align:middle line:84%
But to say that
somehow the universe

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.320 align:middle line:84%
is just peaceful out
there, it's just not true.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.550 align:middle line:10%
The universe is a very messy
place, and it always will be.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.350 align:middle line:84%
There's just no
universe where we

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.370 align:middle line:84%
live in where we can all let our
guard down and trust everyone.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you
mentioned these two--

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.500 align:middle line:90%
this is your two choices.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>> But how is that going
to affect the masses with

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.970 align:middle line:84%
their internal belief
systems, I'll say,

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.310 align:middle line:84%
that are out there that
this is going to go against?

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, like I said, they're
still going to have two

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:53.620 align:middle line:90%
choices.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.745 align:middle line:84%
And they're either going
to have to talk themselves

00:07:55.745 --> 00:07:57.730 align:middle line:84%
into how to be pro
Terran, or they're

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.130 align:middle line:84%
going to talk themselves
into being pro invader.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And it will be a
very, very interesting

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.810 align:middle line:84%
psychological
experiment to see who

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.900 align:middle line:84%
does the mental gymnastics
to contort themselves

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.210 align:middle line:84%
into one place or the other
from the place that they're in.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And I strongly suspect,
based on already some

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.620 align:middle line:84%
of the psychological outcoming
that we have seen from some

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.080 align:middle line:84%
of these stressful
events, you will see

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:90%
people who will be pro invader.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And they will turn
on their own species.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And they will act
absolutely insane and crazy.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.892 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen, so--

00:08:31.892 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:90%
>> We've seen it in history.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.690 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So why is it-- we have
our community here that has

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:84%
their awareness set that being
fourth and fifth density beings

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.050 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have this
war-like consciousness about

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:47.850 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And here we are
in 3D, and we are

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:55.650 align:middle line:90%
having a war with these beings.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.410 align:middle line:84%
There's a conflict of the
belief system right there.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.210 align:middle line:84%
I think the crux of that
is an erroneous assumption

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.470 align:middle line:84%
that there's no conflict
in 4D, or in 5D,

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:12.090 align:middle line:84%
or in any of the densities
above that, which is not true,

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.440 align:middle line:84%
that somehow that there's this
magical line between 3D and 4D,

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:84%
where below here is
conflict, and above here

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.620 align:middle line:84%
is just peace, harmony,
order, and oneness--

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.860 align:middle line:90%
not true.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:28.530 align:middle line:84%
You have elevations of
density and consciousness

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.330 align:middle line:90%
as you move up the ladder.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.360 align:middle line:84%
But this is not a
guarantee that someone

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.730 align:middle line:84%
in a fourth density
state of consciousness

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.670 align:middle line:90%
is peaceful or unified.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.620 align:middle line:84%
It is entirely
possible for someone

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:84%
to evolve themselves from a 3D
to a 4D state of consciousness

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and be the complete
opposite of that.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:84%
So conflict doesn't stop at
3D, and it doesn't just not

00:09:53.730 --> 00:10:00.270 align:middle line:84%
go beyond 4D because light
and dark continue, duality

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.530 align:middle line:90%
continues.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Like, a certain kind
of dualism continues

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle line:84%
where you have opposing
forces who don't always agree,

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.320 align:middle line:84%
who don't always
like each other.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it
comes down to how

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.780 align:middle line:84%
is one group going to
decide that they're

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.310 align:middle line:84%
going to get to
make the decision,

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.480 align:middle line:90%
and it results in a fight.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:25.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not a guarantee
that just because someone

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.820 align:middle line:84%
is at a higher density
that somehow they've

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.240 align:middle line:84%
elevated themselves
above war or conflict.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you say it
gets easier, Randy,

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:38.830 align:middle line:84%
for civilizations and
species to get along?

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>> It tends to.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:40.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.960 align:middle line:90%
It tends to.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.250 align:middle line:84%
The majority, I think, of those
civilizations as they evolve

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.490 align:middle line:84%
do become much more cooperative
and do work together.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle line:84%
But that's not to
say that you could

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:56.320 align:middle line:84%
exist as a 4D civilization and
come in contact with another 4D

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.510 align:middle line:84%
civilization that's
many light years away,

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and have a conflict
of interest that

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.420 align:middle line:84%
could turn into more
than strong words,

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:10.480 align:middle line:84%
and that could turn into actual
physical or violent conflict.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.630 align:middle line:84%
You could still be of
an elevated density

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and an elevated
consciousness and have

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:19.150 align:middle line:84%
diametrically opposed
agendas, and be

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.230 align:middle line:90%
willing to fight over it.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>> What is going to prepare
humanity for disclosure so we

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.830 align:middle line:84%
can be part of this
Galactic Senate?

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I've watched
this unfold over years here--

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:30.580 align:middle line:90%
decades.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And it appears that some of the
things that have been hopeful

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.670 align:middle line:84%
that we would catch on
with and would help us

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.640 align:middle line:84%
bring ourselves as a
planet into a place where

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.250 align:middle line:84%
we could be like, hey,
we're ready for this--

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:47.540 align:middle line:90%
that would have been nice.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But that didn't really happen
because not enough people have

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.690 align:middle line:84%
been cooperative to
those methods, which

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:57.060 align:middle line:84%
is why we're at a potential
invasion scenario,

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.140 align:middle line:84%
so that all of the
people who would rather

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.980 align:middle line:84%
do anything else other than
face that fact or that reality

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle line:84%
or that existence, it simply--
again, has two choices now.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.980 align:middle line:84%
You don't have nine
other things that you

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.790 align:middle line:84%
can decide to go do instead
of standing here and looking

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:18.210 align:middle line:84%
at the ship and the beams
coming down in the sky.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.843 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I got some stuff
to go do, and pretend--

00:12:20.843 --> 00:12:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the
priority right now.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, you don't
have 10 other things

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:26.160 align:middle line:90%
that you can go do.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Two choices-- pro
Terran, pro invader--

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.740 align:middle line:90%
what do you want to be?

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:90%
And that puts people--

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.470 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes the
only way people

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.010 align:middle line:84%
will make that choice is when
they don't have 10 choices,

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.670 align:middle line:90%
is when they only have two.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:41.790 align:middle line:90%
I see that.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:44.980 align:middle line:84%
During this
extraterrestrial invasion,

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.800 align:middle line:84%
will there be other
extraterrestrials

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.150 align:middle line:84%
that may look like us
to help us through this?

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>> That would basically be the
plan is to have an invader that

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.560 align:middle line:84%
is as much not like
us as possible,

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:04.180 align:middle line:84%
so that we have a friend that
is as much like us as possible,

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.950 align:middle line:90%
so that we--

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:12.110 align:middle line:84%
basically, the starting point
that we can get everybody onto

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:18.260 align:middle line:84%
is a binary starting point,
which instead of the mono

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.750 align:middle line:84%
theory point that
most people have,

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:84%
which is either all aliens are
good, or all aliens are bad--

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:31.290 align:middle line:84%
both of those positions
are 100% wrong.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.820 align:middle line:84%
The truth is we need to start
at a binary point of view, which

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.790 align:middle line:84%
is there are some
bad aliens out there,

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.050 align:middle line:90%
and there's some good ones.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.612 align:middle line:84%
And we need to just start
with that distinction.

00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you're very
adamant, Randy,

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:48.530 align:middle line:84%
about it being an
insectoid invasion species.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Is it because that is the
species that is invading us?

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.400 align:middle line:90%
Or is it actually--

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.230 align:middle line:84%
are these hybrids
or clones that were

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:02.280 align:middle line:84%
made by another race because of
the whole psychological effect?

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.440 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is that
this particular species has

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.180 align:middle line:90%
been contracted to do this job.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:09.980 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>> By who?

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The [NON-ENGLISH],,
or the Nazis.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.510 align:middle line:90%
They're contractors.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.400 align:middle line:90%
And again, it's their job.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And they were
chosen for that job

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:22.190 align:middle line:90%
because they are not like us--

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.270 align:middle line:90%
terrifying.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Because being giant bugs
will hit people's amygdalas

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:32.200 align:middle line:84%
in a way in which their
frontal lobe will not

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.270 align:middle line:90%
have time to sort it out.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.970 align:middle line:90%
Your frontal lobe will go, huh.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:38.120 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:84%
That's a giant bug coming
down the road at me.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.860 align:middle line:90%
How should I feel about this?

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Should I want to be friends
with this giant bug?

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Should I want to run
away from this giant bug?

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And in the couple of seconds
that your frontal lobe is

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:50.740 align:middle line:90%
taking to do that--

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.480 align:middle line:90%
way before that ever happens--

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:57.430 align:middle line:84%
at about a half a nanosecond,
your amygdala is going to go--

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:59.830 align:middle line:90%
panic, run.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:03.185 align:middle line:84%
And so before your brain
even has a chance to go, hmm.

00:15:03.185 --> 00:15:05.560 align:middle line:84%
How do I feel about this, and
what do I think about this,

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.913 align:middle line:84%
your amygdala is going to-- like
I said, it's going to panic--

00:15:08.913 --> 00:15:10.330 align:middle line:84%
again, which is
part of the point.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:11.150 align:middle line:90%
We want that.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.200 align:middle line:84%
We want it to get right
past people's frontal lobes

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:84%
into the part of their brain
that says you have two choices.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Make it now, and
hopefully make it right.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Because those who
choose to become

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.470 align:middle line:84%
pro invader will
probably not survive.

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>> What will protect the average
civilian on the streets against

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.470 align:middle line:90%
this invading army?

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And what types of insects
are we looking at?

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:38.950 align:middle line:90%
Could you describe any of them?

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, there's what I saw
in the initial infantry report

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.370 align:middle line:90%
that I got to look at.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Some remote viewers
have been looking

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.938 align:middle line:84%
at some things that are a
little different than what I

00:15:51.938 --> 00:15:53.230 align:middle line:90%
have been seeing in the report.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.052 align:middle line:90%
So I'm willing to go, hmm, OK.

00:15:56.052 --> 00:15:57.010 align:middle line:90%
It could go either way.

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:58.927 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's like what I'm
seeing in the report.

00:15:58.927 --> 00:16:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's like what
this person is seeing.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.200 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing a number
of different smaller

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.740 align:middle line:84%
types of insectoids, like
drones, beetles, bugs

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.970 align:middle line:84%
and so forth that are used
sort of by the leadership

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:17.930 align:middle line:84%
of the insectoids to be a
first wave for the infantry.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.380 align:middle line:84%
So they have an infantry
drone that they're

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.400 align:middle line:84%
going to send
something out first,

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.340 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a small
beetle, or a big beetle,

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:28.450 align:middle line:84%
or a giant beetle, or swarms
of little stinging insects

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:32.605 align:middle line:84%
or something before
their infantry assault.

00:16:32.605 --> 00:16:34.730 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
variables and questions there.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.670 align:middle line:90%
I know what I've seen on paper.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.720 align:middle line:84%
I know what's been
shown to me in reports.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that's
exactly the way that it's

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.520 align:middle line:90%
going to work out.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:46.780 align:middle line:84%
But as near as we can tell, it's
insects because they're scary,

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.800 align:middle line:84%
terrifying, not like
us, and will, again,

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.610 align:middle line:84%
trigger that amygdala
part of the brain

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.600 align:middle line:84%
so everyone really
quickly makes a choice.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Will these invaders actually
allow someone to defect

00:16:58.630 --> 00:16:59.780 align:middle line:90%
to them--

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.990 align:middle line:90%
another earthly human?

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Or is it more of an
extermination process?

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.819 align:middle line:84%
>> That's an
interesting question.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:10.240 align:middle line:84%
That would depend on
which is more correct--

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.940 align:middle line:84%
the reports that I've read,
or whether some of the remote

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.510 align:middle line:84%
views that some professionals,
who are good, have done.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:20.300 align:middle line:84%
So there's some
differentiations in that data,

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and we're just going to have
to see how it works out.

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you mentioned that the
Nazis have these contractors,

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:30.440 align:middle line:90%
these insectoid species.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.625 align:middle line:84%
But who's actually really
behind this, Randy?

00:17:33.625 --> 00:17:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>> A very good question.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.930 align:middle line:84%
So the way this started out was
not the way that it is right

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:40.730 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So the way that this
started out was, can we

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:48.850 align:middle line:84%
find a friendly
contractor who can

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:53.200 align:middle line:84%
play the role of an invader,
which will then sort something

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.560 align:middle line:84%
out that hopefully we won't
get our hair messed up too bad.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.070 align:middle line:84%
What changed in that
significantly was

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:05.290 align:middle line:84%
the [NON-ENGLISH] Nazis made
a different deal to give

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:09.910 align:middle line:84%
the contracting invaders
something different not

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:15.160 align:middle line:84%
to enact the more passive, less
destructive invasion scenario

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:20.050 align:middle line:84%
we originally had on the table,
and then motor that towards

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.980 align:middle line:84%
a fourth, fifth Reich, depending
on which one you think that

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.830 align:middle line:84%
they're on right now,
invasion takeover.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So it went from a we're all
going to kind of do this

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.380 align:middle line:90%
together to no we're not.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.180 align:middle line:90%
Backstab.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.500 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do it our way.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And so the Nazis,
therefore, are trying

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.970 align:middle line:84%
to steal the show into a
different direction that

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:46.140 align:middle line:90%
benefits them and them only.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.990 align:middle line:84%
If we do our jobs right
that won't happen.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't know that
was going to happen.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.760 align:middle line:84%
So for people who are
confused about this,

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.150 align:middle line:84%
what I have said before
was what we could say up

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.340 align:middle line:84%
until that point before we knew
that this was going to happen,

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.660 align:middle line:84%
which was we've
organized and arranged

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.220 align:middle line:84%
some peaceful arrangement for a
not terrible invasion scenario,

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.190 align:middle line:84%
all the while knowing
that the Nazis were

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:12.540 align:middle line:90%
going to do a backstab move.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, I couldn't
say that, right?

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.860 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't say they were
going to do a backstab move

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.402 align:middle line:84%
before they do the move because
then we're projecting that we

00:19:19.402 --> 00:19:21.570 align:middle line:90%
know what they're going to do.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So I had to say it one
way up until the point

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.680 align:middle line:84%
where they went ahead and
did the backstab move.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Then I could go
ahead and say, oh,

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:35.100 align:middle line:84%
now I can explain this
was the plan A. We knew

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.900 align:middle line:90%
what the backstab was coming.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And now here's plan
B as predicted.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.740 align:middle line:84%
But we couldn't explain
it that way until now

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.320 align:middle line:84%
because we'd be
projecting to an opponent

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:84%
that we knew what
they were going to do.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So as confusing
as that may be, I

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.240 align:middle line:90%
hope that that clarifies that.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>> It makes complete sense.

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot there
to take in, but it

00:19:55.020 --> 00:20:00.090 align:middle line:84%
seems like if I were to know a
little bit more about my enemy

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.520 align:middle line:84%
because they're thinking
about this, manifesting this,

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.560 align:middle line:84%
as a matter of fact, then
that would be really bad.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.608 align:middle line:84%
We had to let them do it before
we could do something about it.

00:20:09.608 --> 00:20:11.400 align:middle line:84%
That's why it was a
little confusing there.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.100 align:middle line:84%
So my apologies to anyone
for that being confusing.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.760 align:middle line:90%
I hope that clears it up.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are many people
in intelligence that say

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:22.410 align:middle line:84%
disclosure will never happen,
and it's in the best interests

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.820 align:middle line:84%
of the community
that it doesn't.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Special section intelligence
has made about a dozen

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.990 align:middle line:84%
predictions given to me that--
some of which I have repeated

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:36.120 align:middle line:84%
to people over the
past three years.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.040 align:middle line:90%
They're batting 1,000.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.020 align:middle line:84%
There's only a
couple that have yet

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.430 align:middle line:84%
to occur that we're
waiting to drop.

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go with the
guys that have a 100% track

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:49.110 align:middle line:84%
record instead of people
who have, you know,

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.040 align:middle line:90%
what-- a 10% track record.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.750 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to go with that.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.600 align:middle line:84%
But I understand
that point of view.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And I can respect why someone
would have that point of view.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.390 align:middle line:84%
But I would respectfully
disagree and say

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:middle line:84%
it is more inevitable
that we're going

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:84%
to have to have a
disclosure moment more so

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.310 align:middle line:84%
than it is inevitable
that we'll never have it.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.110 align:middle line:90%
So I get that point of view.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.920 align:middle line:90%
I respect it.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.540 align:middle line:90%
I also respectfully disagree.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, what does Earth
look like after disclosure--

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:19.935 align:middle line:84%
the kind of disclosure
that you speak of?

00:21:19.935 --> 00:21:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>> It depends.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:90%
Six months after?

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:23.520 align:middle line:90%
12 months after?

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.490 align:middle line:90%
Two years after?

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's do six months first,
and then we'll move to 12

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.320 align:middle line:90%
months.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Six months--
probably very messy--

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.040 align:middle line:90%
very, very, very messy.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.360 align:middle line:84%
12 months-- could
still be messy.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Messy meaning
worldwide havoc?

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Could you be a little
bit more definitive?

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Blood and gore-- what
are you getting at?

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.370 align:middle line:90%
Loss of electricity, public--

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Ukraine everywhere
in the world.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.613 align:middle line:90%
So imagine what--

00:21:51.613 --> 00:21:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Post-apocalyptic
war situation.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine what's been
happening to Ukraine happening

00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:01.140 align:middle line:84%
to the whole rest of the world--
war-torn, battered, damaged,

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:01.940 align:middle line:90%
windows broken--

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Are the governments preparing
for refugees and safe havens

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.990 align:middle line:84%
in the planet for
this, or off planet?

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I would be surprised if
someone wasn't doing something

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.500 align:middle line:84%
like that, but I am--
it's not my department,

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:20.720 align:middle line:84%
so I don't know what all
the plans for civic help,

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.370 align:middle line:90%
engagement, and salvation are.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I know that there are plenty
of plans and agendas for that.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:28.550 align:middle line:84%
But war is my department,
not first aid.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So even at 12 months, you're
saying we're still around--

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.227 align:middle line:84%
at six to 12 months
we're still--

00:22:34.227 --> 00:22:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>> It's going to be messy.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.280 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be real
messy for about--

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.600 align:middle line:90%
at least that amount of time.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:84%
I would say once we get
to that two-year postmark,

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.820 align:middle line:84%
we could actually be looking at
reconstruction by that point.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.270 align:middle line:84%
So-- and once we're
at reconstruction,

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:51.620 align:middle line:84%
then it's clean air, clean
water, clean everything,

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:52.520 align:middle line:90%
new buildings.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you believe we'll
be working with these

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.540 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
species by then?

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Or is this something we
just adopted new sciences

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.890 align:middle line:84%
by ourselves, or
were we helped out?

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, definitely
we've been helped out,

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:08.760 align:middle line:84%
and we definitely will
be helped out as well.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So part of the
reconstruction process

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:15.800 align:middle line:84%
is not just to have a
friend from out of town

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.630 align:middle line:84%
who comes along
and says, uh, we'll

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:19.610 align:middle line:90%
help you get rid of these guys.

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:20.570 align:middle line:90%
We say thanks.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:23.900 align:middle line:90%
It's also so when they--

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.420 align:middle line:84%
when they're still here
after the invaders leave,

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.580 align:middle line:84%
and they start rolling
up their sleeves and say,

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.360 align:middle line:84%
all right, give me a
shovel let me help out,

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.240 align:middle line:84%
then we're going to develop
a relationship with them.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Because not only did they
help shoo away the invader,

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:43.010 align:middle line:84%
they stuck around
to shovel and mop

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:46.910 align:middle line:84%
and help and paint and rebuild
because they're here to help.

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>> But how does humanity
act after, let's say,

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.960 align:middle line:90%
five years after this invasion.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to be racist
against the insectoids?

00:23:55.550 --> 00:24:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Sadly-- and this one hurts me
deeply because I have insectoid

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.270 align:middle line:84%
friends that I consider some
of the most fabulous people

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:06.775 align:middle line:90%
I've ever met.

00:24:06.775 --> 00:24:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think
we're going to have

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:11.660 align:middle line:84%
some deep insectoid
speciesism here for a minute.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:12.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's sad.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:13.260 align:middle line:84%
That breaks my
heart a little bit.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So we won't be conscious
enough to forgive and forget

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:16.610 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Not for at least 10 years--

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.520 align:middle line:90%
maybe 20.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.062 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a
minute where we're

00:24:21.062 --> 00:24:23.030 align:middle line:84%
going to be angry and
hate bugs for a second.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.220 align:middle line:84%
You have mentioned
these invaders,

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.030 align:middle line:84%
but what if they're
not a false flag?

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about the Nazis
hiring these contractors.

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:34.020 align:middle line:90%
What if they do win?

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't think that they
will, and let me tell you why.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.230 align:middle line:90%
So first of all, I'm--

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:44.310 align:middle line:84%
without being able to say what
I know about military capability

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:46.930 align:middle line:84%
among covert military
space program personnel,

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:52.020 align:middle line:84%
including ship capability, drive
systems, power systems, weapon

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.690 align:middle line:84%
systems, particle
beams, missiles,

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:59.760 align:middle line:84%
quantum missiles, special
forces personnel, sidearms,

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.580 align:middle line:84%
body armor, personnel
shielding, I

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.490 align:middle line:84%
mean I know what we have to
fight with, first of all.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.500 align:middle line:84%
So knowing what we
have to fight with,

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I think our chances
are better than good.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Randy, when do you think
this is going to happen?

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Is there a timeline you
could share with us?

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:20.730 align:middle line:84%
We've always said that this
is an event-driven series

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:23.190 align:middle line:90%
of events, not date-driven.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:28.410 align:middle line:84%
So very early on a few
years ago we said-- well,

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.030 align:middle line:90%
December of 2019--

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:33.100 align:middle line:84%
said that we were entering
into a pandemic phase, which

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:33.900 align:middle line:90%
was phase one.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And then there was going to be
a civil disruption phase-- phase

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:36.390 align:middle line:90%
two.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And then there would be a World
War III phase, which we are in.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.950 align:middle line:84%
We have seen all
three of those happen.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And then there would
be an invasion phase.

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.660 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about where we
are right now, which is here,

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.290 align:middle line:90%
number three, stage three.

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:51.510 align:middle line:84%
So we fully expect that
when the World War III

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:55.530 align:middle line:84%
phase is fully engaged is
when that phase four is

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:58.335 align:middle line:84%
most likely to occur
very soon after.

00:25:58.335 --> 00:26:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>> After it's completed
or during that phase?

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:01.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, during.

00:26:01.925 --> 00:26:04.050 align:middle line:84%
During this phase-- during
the World War III phase.

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that would
be the best time, right?

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, it would be.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:08.880 align:middle line:84%
So what we're waiting for
in this-- we've already

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.330 align:middle line:84%
seen what we know was
part one of this, which

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.910 align:middle line:90%
is Russia invading Ukraine.

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:19.350 align:middle line:84%
We knew that the
three other axis

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:22.140 align:middle line:84%
powers that were going to have
to get involved before this

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:27.240 align:middle line:84%
was fully going was going to be
Iran, China, and North Korea.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.690 align:middle line:84%
So Iran has been supplying
drones to the Russians.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So the Iranians and the Russians
are fully in bed with that

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.290 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:38.400 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese have begun to
fund and assist the Russians.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.240 align:middle line:84%
The North Koreans have been
sending the Russians uniforms

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.840 align:middle line:90%
and some other stuff.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:48.270 align:middle line:84%
So Chinese-- we're waiting
for them to invade Taiwan.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.090 align:middle line:84%
So there's continued escalation,
continued saber-rattling.

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:54.180 align:middle line:84%
We have a massive movement
of ships and warplanes

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.440 align:middle line:90%
over the Strait of Taiwan--

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Chinese warships moving
over the Strait of Taiwan.

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:00.300 align:middle line:84%
So they're even closer
than they have ever

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.250 align:middle line:90%
been to that escalating point.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.020 align:middle line:84%
North Korea has
also just launched

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.450 align:middle line:84%
several ballistic
missiles over Japan,

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:10.140 align:middle line:84%
or into the Sea of Japan,
provoking the Japanese.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.990 align:middle line:84%
That's been closer
and closer escalating.

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So what we're seeing, again, is
all of these things escalating.

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:20.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like this--
closer, closer, closer.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:24.360 align:middle line:84%
We're more here than
we ever have been.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> How are you going to
have a more evolved humanity

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.520 align:middle line:90%
that's based on a war scenario?

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it doesn't happen
based on a war scenario.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:39.970 align:middle line:84%
It happens based on the
rebuilding after the war

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:40.770 align:middle line:90%
scenario.

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.770 align:middle line:84%
The war scenario is
the transition point.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.560 align:middle line:90%
We're already a mess.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And we're so much of
a mess that we really

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:53.530 align:middle line:84%
just need to become all the way
a mess so that we can clean up

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:54.330 align:middle line:90%
our act.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:56.520 align:middle line:84%
If we don't go to
that point, then we're

00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:02.130 align:middle line:84%
going to forever be that
person on the edge of being

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.810 align:middle line:90%
a terrible, horrible hot mess.

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:06.120 align:middle line:84%
But without being
able to actually make

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:11.490 align:middle line:84%
fundamental change,
the war scenario--

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:16.450 align:middle line:84%
again, it says we're not giving
you the choice to change.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:18.600 align:middle line:84%
We're telling you
you have two choices

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.190 align:middle line:90%
on how you want to change.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:24.300 align:middle line:84%
That leads us through
that conflict,

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.515 align:middle line:84%
working together to a
reconstruction phase

00:28:27.515 --> 00:28:28.890 align:middle line:84%
where, again, we
have friends who

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:33.420 align:middle line:84%
come help out, shoo the bad guys
away, roll up their sleeves,

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.220 align:middle line:90%
get out their shovels and help.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:36.510 align:middle line:90%
And then we have--

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:40.080 align:middle line:84%
that's the consciousness
shifting point

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.820 align:middle line:90%
where we get to move upward.

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.170 align:middle line:90%
In order for that to happen--

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:48.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would be lovely if
we could do that from here.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:53.940 align:middle line:84%
But there's no way that we
are going to break the level

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:58.920 align:middle line:84%
of self-interested selfishness--
let's just call it what it is--

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.920 align:middle line:84%
to start thinking about
planetary well-being

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.670 align:middle line:84%
at large unless
everything's on the line.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:09.060 align:middle line:84%
But then when that
conflict ends,

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:12.180 align:middle line:84%
that's when we can put
all that stuff behind us.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:17.300 align:middle line:84%
But we can't put it behind
us without shaking up

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:22.740 align:middle line:84%
the snow globe so hard that
it dislodges everything.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.570 align:middle line:90%
So then it's easier to clean up.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:30.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not cleanupable
until you shake it so hard

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:32.980 align:middle line:90%
that everything's loose.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Once everything is
loose, it's cleanable.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:40.510 align:middle line:84%
But as a static,
rigid existence,

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:42.010 align:middle line:90%
you can't fix it that way.

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.930 align:middle line:84%
You just can't fix it
that way because there's

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:47.530 align:middle line:84%
too much resistance
at every single point

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:51.370 align:middle line:84%
of civilized entry, whether
it's civic politics, education,

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:55.210 align:middle line:84%
infrastructure, government,
military, health

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:56.980 align:middle line:90%
care, hospitals, technology.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.540 align:middle line:84%
You can't make any
of that movement

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.260 align:middle line:90%
in that static situation.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.910 align:middle line:84%
But once you've turned that
into a chaotic situation,

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:05.050 align:middle line:90%
then it's dealable.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other
thing about this is

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:12.190 align:middle line:84%
I realize it seems very
organized, but it's not.

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:15.370 align:middle line:84%
What these are are
not organized events.

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:17.620 align:middle line:84%
They're inevitabilities
that we have

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:22.870 align:middle line:84%
been able to calculate and
track for years, decades even,

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:26.800 align:middle line:84%
going OK, we're going to
reach an inevitability here

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.760 align:middle line:84%
where this social situation
is going to break.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.610 align:middle line:84%
We're going to reach an
inevitability right about out

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:37.360 align:middle line:84%
there where this environmental
situation is going to break.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:40.510 align:middle line:84%
We're going to enter an
inevitability right about there

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:43.570 align:middle line:84%
where this global conflict
is going to break.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And it just turns out,
conveniently or not,

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:52.010 align:middle line:84%
that the point where all
of those inevitable things

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:55.190 align:middle line:90%
are coming is in the present.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:59.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's really about preparing
for inevitabilities that we've

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:01.310 align:middle line:90%
known were inevitable.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.230 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
happen no matter what.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:06.840 align:middle line:84%
It was just a matter of how,
when, why, where they all

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.640 align:middle line:90%
worked out.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And what seemed to occur
as we got closer and closer

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:13.250 align:middle line:84%
is watching all of these
inevitabilities come together

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:15.920 align:middle line:84%
going, I think they're
all going to crash

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.770 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of that
intersection at the same time.

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:21.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, isn't that convenient?

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.420 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we can work with that.

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we can work with
that chaotic interaction

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:29.650 align:middle line:84%
and create some stable
order out of that.

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't,
then someone else

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.140 align:middle line:84%
is going to create another
kind of stable order out

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.390 align:middle line:90%
of that that will suck real bad.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm kind of against
Nazis creating stable order

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:42.180 align:middle line:84%
out of anything
because, again, it's

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.940 align:middle line:84%
not in their nature to be
able to succeed at that ever.

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>> As Tim would say, let's
all shift happily now and put

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:51.540 align:middle line:84%
our best intention for
the possibility of a safe

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.473 align:middle line:90%
and peaceful transition.

00:31:53.473 --> 00:31:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>> That's good advice.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Randy, thank you for
being on the show again.

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure".

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.800 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
