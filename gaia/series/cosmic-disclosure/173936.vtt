00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID WILCOCK: All right.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.860 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back to
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.140 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock
and I am here with Emery Smith

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.250 align:middle line:10%
continuing our
fascinating discussion

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.350 align:middle line:10%
into underground civilizations.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.454 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome back.

00:00:27.454 --> 00:00:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH:
Well, thanks, Dave.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.000 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to
get into this one.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So one of the things
that I'm curious about,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.390 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot of light
bulbs going off in my head

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.305 align:middle line:84%
right now, we have the
crash site in Antarctica

00:00:42.305 --> 00:00:43.930 align:middle line:84%
that we've already
talked about before.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.340 align:middle line:84%
You said there's
a very massive--

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.350 align:middle line:84%
you confirmed independently, a
very massive mothership there.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That we've been
studying for how long?

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: As far as I know,
through these scientists,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.900 align:middle line:90%
24 years.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And we have some
kind of connection

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.920 align:middle line:84%
between that wreckage and
the underground civilization

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:84%
that you described in Ecuador,
which you said is actually

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:90%
started maybe as a craft.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.980 align:middle line:84%
But then it got built
out or something?

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.940 align:middle line:84%
I think the energy of the
craft must have stimulated--

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.900 align:middle line:84%
must have had also
organisms on it or bacteria,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.350 align:middle line:84%
because it changed the
inside of the cavern

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.380 align:middle line:84%
into a different
atmosphere, even.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.039 align:middle line:84%
And the creatures
that are down there

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.830 align:middle line:84%
and that plant life
and stuff is completely

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.512 align:middle line:90%
different than the surface.

00:01:29.512 --> 00:01:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And they have taken creatures
out there, brought them

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.520 align:middle line:90%
to the surface.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.700 align:middle line:90%
And they instantly died.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Can you breathe the
air without an apparatus?

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.880 align:middle line:90%
It's the cleanest air.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.282 align:middle line:84%
I felt great down
there, actually.

00:01:40.282 --> 00:01:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And they've already tested
it over and over and over.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.740 align:middle line:84%
This is a new find, by
the way, that I'm aware.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Just to recap
this Ecuador thing briefly.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.660 align:middle line:84%
One of the pieces of intel
we got from Pete Peterson--

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.160 align:middle line:84%
he talked at great length about
how the ship in Antarctica

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.550 align:middle line:90%
had--

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.420 align:middle line:84%
that when you lived in
the place in the ship,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.110 align:middle line:90%
that you had your own yard.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And there was like a filtration
system of from the bathroom,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:84%
from your shower,
from the toilet

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.930 align:middle line:84%
that would go in and
feed this garden.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.967 align:middle line:84%
And so obviously, this
was buried under the ice.

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:16.300 align:middle line:90%
And so everything was destroyed.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.910 align:middle line:84%
But now what you're
telling me about Ecuador

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.160 align:middle line:84%
makes me wonder if
maybe the vegetation

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.340 align:middle line:84%
in that ship in your own yard
would have looked similar.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.020 align:middle line:84%
What would your
thoughts be on that?

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.030 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
definite correlation

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.890 align:middle line:90%
between that and there.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.230 align:middle line:84%
These are two completely
different environments,

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:90%
of course, now.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So I would expect different
things to happen chemically.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.547 align:middle line:84%
But that's still
open for observation.

00:02:40.547 --> 00:02:42.505 align:middle line:84%
I know they have a really
good team down there.

00:02:42.505 --> 00:02:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And they're not mistreating
it and just chopping it all up

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.470 align:middle line:90%
and taking it all out.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.780 align:middle line:90%
So we'll see what happens.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, another
thing that has

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.490 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of light bulbs
popping off in my head

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.720 align:middle line:84%
is that the oldest of the
Antarctica wreckage that I've

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.970 align:middle line:84%
heard about, from
more than one source,

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.130 align:middle line:84%
is apparently
33-feet-tall giants.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.339 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, yes.

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Have you heard
anything like that?

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, I've
heard about that.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.341 align:middle line:90%
What did you hear specifically?

00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That there was a
lot of other sarcophagis

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.280 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other
extraterrestrials, bodies

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.280 align:middle line:84%
down there that were over
30 feet tall that they

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.720 align:middle line:90%
have already found excavated.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.090 align:middle line:90%
Some were removed.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:90%
Some were not, of course.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.390 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to build a
story now behind everything

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.230 align:middle line:84%
and slowly release it to the
public in a very calm way,

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.304 align:middle line:84%
because it goes
against, of course,

00:03:32.304 --> 00:03:33.970 align:middle line:84%
all the stuff that
we've been brought up

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.220 align:middle line:84%
to believe as far as where
we come from and religion.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.990 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to just
slowly seep these things out.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:84%
One of the amazing things that
we found at this other place

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.350 align:middle line:84%
that we were talking
about earlier--

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.183 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: In America?

00:03:48.183 --> 00:03:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --in America,
was a 33-foot being

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.880 align:middle line:84%
inside a sarcophagi
in a state of status.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So this is kind
of a pre-Adamite-type being

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.820 align:middle line:90%
we believe.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
pyramids are nearby.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.660 align:middle line:84%
That empty block cube
rooms are nearby.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.620 align:middle line:84%
The five acres of white
powdered gold is nearby.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the steps
descend down into the hollowed

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.100 align:middle line:84%
out meteorite or
whatever you want

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.290 align:middle line:84%
to call it, the
hollowed out earth

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:84%
rock that is suspended
mass around an aquifer.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.420 align:middle line:84%
So regarding stasis
beings, we have

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.700 align:middle line:84%
heard from Corey,
some of the most

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:84%
recent briefings he got-- and I
believe Peterson had this too.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.280 align:middle line:84%
That they found
stasis beings that

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.670 align:middle line:84%
were 500,000 years
old in the earliest

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.850 align:middle line:90%
Antarctica city of the--

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.225 align:middle line:84%
there's a very,
very ancient one.

00:04:40.225 --> 00:04:42.340 align:middle line:84%
It's over a billion
years old, apparently.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.670 align:middle line:84%
But then the recent one
of 500,000 years ago

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.860 align:middle line:84%
had this exact same
thing you just described.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:90%
So that is amazing.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Did you hear about similar
stasis beings in Antarctica?

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm curious.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, I did not.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.900 align:middle line:84%
No, I did not hear
about any stasis beings

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:90%
that were in Antarctica.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.130 align:middle line:90%
They did not talk about that.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's many teams,
just so you know.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And this team was only a
team of four scientists.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.914 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There's thousands
of scientists on this project

00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
down there that work for
different governments

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:84%
and our government
and that are trying

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:84%
to cover up things and
keep things also preserved.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, I don't
believe the craft actually

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.714 align:middle line:90%
crashed there either.

00:05:25.714 --> 00:05:27.880 align:middle line:84%
I really think the craft
actually was there and just

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:90%
stayed there.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And whatever happened
happened at that time,

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.360 align:middle line:84%
whether it was a cataclysmic
event or whatnot.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And now
the snow is melting,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and Earth is going to
be full disclosure.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: When we're
looking at Antarctica

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.810 align:middle line:84%
being such a
subject of interest,

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.920 align:middle line:84%
one of the insiders
I spoke to said

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.240 align:middle line:84%
that there was a dark
agenda, to some degree,

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:90%
for disclosing Antarctica.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.880 align:middle line:84%
They felt that it would be
able to create a religious war.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Just speculating, why do
you think that might be?

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well
everything down there

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.290 align:middle line:84%
is just going to destroy
organized religion

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.502 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:06:11.502 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Why do
you think it would?

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because they have
found tablets and information

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence
down there that's

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:26.160 align:middle line:84%
proving the history
of Mars and the moon

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.770 align:middle line:84%
and the history of this
area of the universe.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.170 align:middle line:84%
I'll say this area
of the universe.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And they're starting
to decipher it now.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So that being brought
up would cause,

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:90%
probably, a huge conflict.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they're worried about

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.900 align:middle line:84%
is us misbehaving because
of our religious beliefs.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:53.860 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't necessarily
mean that Jesus was fake

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.485 align:middle line:84%
or Moses was fake or
Mohammad was fake.

00:06:55.485 --> 00:06:56.285 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, no.

00:06:56.285 --> 00:06:57.340 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.590 align:middle line:84%
All these avatars have lived
here and have been here

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and have been these
amazing gods and people.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen is, if
they did bring up everything,

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.150 align:middle line:90%
it just--

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say the
stories that are

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.880 align:middle line:84%
being told or not completely
told to the full extent.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.890 align:middle line:84%
There's gaps and things
that are missing.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And this will fill
all those gaps.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's like an unfinished
book with all the religions.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.490 align:middle line:84%
So this will fill in
all those loose gaps.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And everyone actually
will come correct.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.200 align:middle line:84%
But of course, I'm
sure some will not.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Some maybe won't believe it.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.130 align:middle line:84%
To believe something
your entire life

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and then have an
archaeologist bring something

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.710 align:middle line:84%
up to the surface that
says something different,

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.690 align:middle line:84%
it could cause some
turmoil in the world.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you're saying
that this massive boulder that

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:54.390 align:middle line:84%
was found somewhere in America
at an undisclosed location

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:90%
has remains of giants in it.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, correct.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And could you
explain a little bit more.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.480 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned armor.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.510 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned skeletons.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:09.030 align:middle line:10%
A lot of skeletons and armor,
lots of gold and silver,

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.940 align:middle line:10%
and the old
medieval-type treasure

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.400 align:middle line:10%
stuff that you would
find, lots of coins,

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.260 align:middle line:10%
lots of pots full of coins.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: But I
thought I also heard

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.960 align:middle line:84%
you say that you felt like
the entire interior of the egg

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.070 align:middle line:84%
was also stuffed
with white gold.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:29.576 align:middle line:84%
There's about five
acres that we determined

00:08:29.576 --> 00:08:32.220 align:middle line:84%
of powdered white gold in
there in a separate section.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like
the whole entire egg

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.039 align:middle line:90%
is filled with white gold?

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:36.165 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:08:36.165 --> 00:08:37.205 align:middle line:90%
Just one small cavities.

00:08:37.205 --> 00:08:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: There are
cavities that people

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:90%
could use to walk around in?

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, yes, right.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And these steps are
fairly large steps.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.860 align:middle line:84%
They're not just
your normal steps,

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.280 align:middle line:90%
anywhere from eight to 13 feet.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Coming up and down.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So giants
for sure, 33 feet.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.247 align:middle line:84%
Eight feet for a
33-foot tall being.

00:08:56.247 --> 00:08:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It would
be just about right.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Would be
just about right.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.130 align:middle line:90%
How clean are the steps?

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.350 align:middle line:90%
How do they look?

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
using the technology

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.670 align:middle line:84%
we have, they're
flawless, kind of

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.870 align:middle line:84%
like how the pyramids and
Machu Picchu was built.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Everything is just
such a perfect edge.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we knew.

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:20.390 align:middle line:84%
It was like, no way could
Earth have created this.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And you're saying
that, hypothetically,

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:28.050 align:middle line:84%
if you have a submarine
and you know where to go,

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.380 align:middle line:84%
you could navigate
into the Earth

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and swim right up
to this boulder.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That aquifer,
unfortunately,

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:84%
has a small inlet in
and a small inlet out.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.390 align:middle line:84%
It's just this hollowed area
that does hold a lot of water.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.860 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't see any large
areas that a submarine

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.660 align:middle line:90%
could fit into.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.045 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh, OK.

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And that's
why we just started

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.246 align:middle line:84%
from the surface of the
Earth and just decided

00:09:50.246 --> 00:09:55.020 align:middle line:84%
to drill on down, just drill
straight down till we hit it,

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.270 align:middle line:84%
and then worry
about it from there.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:01.530 align:middle line:84%
But the problem was
three feet of water

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.570 align:middle line:84%
with millions of
pounds of pressure.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Now, you
were describing

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:84%
this very strange
idea, which I remember

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.370 align:middle line:84%
you did have me talk to the
scientist who invented this

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:15.510 align:middle line:84%
for a while, something
about this light

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:19.200 align:middle line:84%
that gold emanates that
seems to penetrate matter

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.320 align:middle line:84%
and can be detected by certain
people who maybe are psychic.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Is it like remote viewing?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, no, it's
not like remote viewing.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.870 align:middle line:84%
They actually have different
cones in their eyes and stuff

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.840 align:middle line:84%
that can see many
different wavelengths

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.740 align:middle line:90%
of blue and gray light.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So for some reason, they
can look across the ocean

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.990 align:middle line:84%
and see a place that has
a large amount of gold,

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.180 align:middle line:84%
unlike how our
treasure hunters today,

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.470 align:middle line:90%
we don't have that capability.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So we pay off people
in the government

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and use satellites or borrow
satellites from corporations

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.310 align:middle line:90%
to look through the ocean.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.920 align:middle line:84%
But these treasures that are
most amazing, unfortunately,

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.047 align:middle line:84%
are on land, below
the land, in land.

00:11:02.047 --> 00:11:03.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's a different
type of treasure hunting

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.810 align:middle line:90%
now, as you can see.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.240 align:middle line:84%
One of the funny things
some of the treasure hunters

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.300 align:middle line:84%
that taught me that
were very famous--

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.640 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, how do you
guys always find the gold?

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Because not everyone has a
chance to use a satellite.

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
if we know of an area

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.770 align:middle line:84%
that someone says has
gold, we'll go down there

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.320 align:middle line:90%
and scoop up all the seaweed.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll take it home
and feed it to all the rats.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And we'll wait for
the rats to poop,

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.960 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll see the gold.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll go back
and take the gold.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:39.390 align:middle line:84%
So they'll measure
the rat poop using,

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I think, a spectrometer or
something, some sort of device.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.109 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that crazy?

00:11:45.109 --> 00:11:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: That's stuff
you couldn't make up.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.140 align:middle line:90%
It's just too weird.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So anyway,
these famous people,

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.340 align:middle line:84%
these famous treasure
hunters that are really

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:57.030 align:middle line:84%
great people that were in
charge of this-- amazing people,

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.367 align:middle line:84%
loving people, giving people,
because they want to give.

00:11:59.367 --> 00:12:00.950 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
keep this treasure.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.120 align:middle line:84%
They want to give
it back to the world

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.650 align:middle line:90%
and create things for the world.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: I want to go out on
a limb here and ask you this.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.170 align:middle line:84%
I kind of get the sense
what you're saying

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:14.850 align:middle line:84%
is that maybe there's a certain
strain of extraterrestrial DNA

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.730 align:middle line:84%
that's seeded into
human population.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And those people, whether
they're aware of it or not,

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.430 align:middle line:84%
might have a slightly
different optical apparatus,

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.740 align:middle line:84%
slightly different
retinal tissue

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.710 align:middle line:84%
that, if they became aware
of what they could do,

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:33.150 align:middle line:84%
they could learn that they would
see this unusual efflorescence

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.720 align:middle line:90%
around where a gold deposit is.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It could be.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
also that somehow,

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:45.780 align:middle line:84%
they were downloaded
from an extraterrestrial

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.220 align:middle line:84%
to increase their vision
and have an upgrade.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.730 align:middle line:90%
We call them upgrades.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.870 align:middle line:84%
So there are certain
people and very,

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.280 align:middle line:84%
highly special agents that work
at the highest levels that have

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.700 align:middle line:84%
these special abilities
that they use these special

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:04.500 align:middle line:84%
abilities for whatever--whoever
they are working for.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.300 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
is, inside that cavern

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.110 align:middle line:84%
is all some other
things that we have

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:18.474 align:middle line:84%
found that shows the lineage
from where everyone came from.

00:13:18.474 --> 00:13:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
biggest gifts we could have.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard for
me to say that.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.670 align:middle line:84%
That's the biggest
secret that's down

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:32.410 align:middle line:84%
there is the secret to all
of us and where we came from

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:36.810 align:middle line:84%
and the lineage of our
DNA and what it contains

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:41.090 align:middle line:84%
and also instructions
on how to read that DNA

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.660 align:middle line:84%
and instructions on
how to build star gates

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and open up portals
and things like that.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's a plethora of not
only religious artifacts

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrial
artifacts, but it's

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:57.550 align:middle line:84%
also got a lot of amazing tools
in there that we could use.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we're just not
ready for it yet to be opened.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So how was
this scientist--

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and I understand I might
be treading into areas

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:10.460 align:middle line:84%
that are talking out of
school, too classified

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.260 align:middle line:90%
for you to mention.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.240 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to see
how close we can get.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Did this scientist, for
example, have the ability

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.000 align:middle line:84%
to see these weird
colors himself,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.280 align:middle line:84%
or did he find
somebody who could?

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.080 align:middle line:84%
Was the technology in some way
based on the organic function?

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.850 align:middle line:90%
He was born this way.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So he was a gifted
person who joined the military

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and was an amazing remote
viewer and became right

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.970 align:middle line:84%
up at the highest
echelon of people

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:44.630 align:middle line:84%
to go to when they need to
find something, or someone.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And he's very well
respected amongst his peers.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Could you explain,
just because I'm sure people are

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.295 align:middle line:84%
going to be really
curious about this--

00:14:54.295 --> 00:14:55.830 align:middle line:90%
I know I am.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:59.490 align:middle line:84%
If you had those special
rods and cones in your eye,

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:90%
what would you see?

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Would it look like misty
fog or exactly what?

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.830 align:middle line:84%
From what I've
gathered, and this

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:15.260 align:middle line:84%
is second hand information,
that they see just like we do.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:21.430 align:middle line:84%
However, if they're looking,
of course, for something,

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:26.350 align:middle line:84%
it's just off just like one
small frequency of light.

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:28.900 align:middle line:84%
It just means
maybe your shirt, I

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.330 align:middle line:84%
can see many blues in it,
a couple of different blues

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:32.410 align:middle line:90%
because of the dyes.

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.120 align:middle line:90%
They didn't dye it correctly.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, a normal person would
just see a blue shirt.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:39.745 align:middle line:84%
But I would see maybe a couple
of strands of cotton there

00:15:39.745 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
or Rayon that was
a little different.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's not throwing
them off tremendously.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So are you
saying that the number

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.140 align:middle line:84%
of different unique colors
that these people can see

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.730 align:middle line:90%
is more than average?

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, absolutely.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.119 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: By how much?

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I
know they can see up

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.230 align:middle line:84%
to 10 different wavelengths
of just one color.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.340 align:middle line:90%
And I have heard of 20.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Wow.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So that's a lot
to break down one color.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's, like I
told you, that was

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:09.990 align:middle line:90%
second-hand information.

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you're saying that
they can still somehow detect

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:17.950 align:middle line:84%
things that would be
underground, like a gold vein

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:18.750 align:middle line:90%
underground?

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because of the flora
and the plants and the rocks

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:25.150 align:middle line:84%
all emanate from the gold
reservoir down there.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.740 align:middle line:84%
It seeps up and gives
it special energy.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And this energy is then
emanated into the atmosphere,

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.230 align:middle line:84%
kind of like orgonite
can control things

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.189 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, the energy
that it gives off.

00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, that's one of
the things that's so interesting

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:42.630 align:middle line:90%
is this idea.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.800 align:middle line:10%
Wilhelm Reich, when he was
working with orgone energy,

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.150 align:middle line:10%
apparently started to
develop a bluing of his skin.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And he often associated orgone
energy with a bluish light.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I have
multiple episodes

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:03.060 align:middle line:84%
on this in "Wisdom Teachings,"
my other show, where

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.670 align:middle line:84%
he's finding life
spontaneously forming

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.130 align:middle line:90%
with what he calls bions.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And the bions appear as
these little blue corpuscles

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.130 align:middle line:84%
that seemingly
come out of nothing

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:18.970 align:middle line:84%
and then coalesce into
proteins and biological matter.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:24.798 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So if that is
the essence of life,

00:17:24.798 --> 00:17:26.339 align:middle line:84%
then is there some
connection between

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:28.390 align:middle line:90%
gold and biological life?

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
it's not just gold.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Orbitally rearranged
monoatomic elements

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.990 align:middle line:90%
is what you want to look at.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.650 align:middle line:84%
You want to look at
the elements that we're

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:42.780 align:middle line:84%
made up of when we we're brought
into this world as a baby.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.150 align:middle line:84%
We never get those
elements ever again

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.430 align:middle line:90%
from our food or our water.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:51.990 align:middle line:84%
These are palladium
and rhodium and iridium

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and all these different
types of elements

00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:03.870 align:middle line:84%
that are the trace elements that
we need in our DNA to evolve.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.210 align:middle line:84%
So of course, there's many
places that make ORMEs.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.342 align:middle line:90%
You've got to be careful.

00:18:07.342 --> 00:18:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, I remember
hearing that rhodium,

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.867 align:middle line:84%
if you capped the DNA
molecule with rhodium,

00:18:11.867 --> 00:18:13.950 align:middle line:84%
it becomes far more
electrically conductive than--

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So I'm a big,
strong believer in ORMEs.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I take it pretty much
every day, zeolite too.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.800 align:middle line:84%
These things help with
aligning the DNA for it

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:84%
to work correctly with
the right voltage.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:33.260 align:middle line:84%
If it's not the right voltage,
we can't really fix ourselves.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.920 align:middle line:84%
If it's not the
right voltage, we

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.844 align:middle line:84%
can't evolve beyond
where we're at now.

00:18:37.844 --> 00:18:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Let me just
point this out too,

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:84%
which is that the research I've
done into what you're calling

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.320 align:middle line:84%
ORMEs, or orbitally rearranged
monoatomic elements,

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.010 align:middle line:84%
is that they are actually
what some scientists call

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:54.420 align:middle line:84%
microclusters, meaning that,
if you allow atoms to come out

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:58.080 align:middle line:84%
of a nozzle one at a time, they
will preferentially cluster

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.960 align:middle line:84%
into these beautiful
geometric, sacred geometry

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.140 align:middle line:84%
patterns, three-dimensional
patterns like a cube,

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.080 align:middle line:84%
octahedron, dodecahedron,
icosahedron.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And the molecules will
actually form into that.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, once it
has that structure,

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.670 align:middle line:84%
it's much more
electrically resistant

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:18.210 align:middle line:84%
on the outside conductive
on the inside, much harder,

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.600 align:middle line:84%
much more resistant to
temperature, to wear.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.100 align:middle line:84%
It has all these
amazing qualities.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to
nourish the body.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.360 align:middle line:84%
So why do you think
the sacred geometry

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.890 align:middle line:90%
connection is so important?

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because that's
what we are made up of.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:84%
That is the smallest
particles beyond the electron

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.030 align:middle line:84%
that we are made
up that allows us

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:43.600 align:middle line:84%
to actually, in
some point in time,

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.480 align:middle line:90%
transdimensionally travel.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: So you
would confirm then,

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:50.860 align:middle line:84%
that part of the
classified science

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.710 align:middle line:84%
is that when you get down to
the real ground state of matter,

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.030 align:middle line:90%
that it is sacred geometry?

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely, yes.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.239 align:middle line:84%
Could you give me
any further specifics

00:19:59.239 --> 00:20:01.030 align:middle line:84%
of any briefing you
might have had on that?

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.320 align:middle line:90%
What were you told exactly?

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, we
were dealing a lot

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:07.480 align:middle line:84%
with magnetic energy and
magnets and permanent magnets

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.350 align:middle line:84%
and trying to do a lot
of things with magnets

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:17.500 align:middle line:84%
and change the flux field, the
north and south polarities.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And then using
special equipment,

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:24.820 align:middle line:84%
zoom in after we changed these
different shapes of magnets,

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:28.390 align:middle line:84%
not your normal
north-south cube magnet,

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and change these angles,
and then zoom in there

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:36.160 align:middle line:84%
and see what is going on
at that level of these two

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.100 align:middle line:84%
magnetic-- permanent magnetic
energies coming together

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.490 align:middle line:84%
with different flux fields
at different angles.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And at that level, which
has not been completed,

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:51.070 align:middle line:90%
is these shapes.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Geometries, wow.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: These
sacred geometries.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So they believe by
changing flux fields,

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.490 align:middle line:84%
they can actually
open up portals.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:04.390 align:middle line:84%
They can open up different
energy for our DNA.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:05.320 align:middle line:90%
They can help us heal.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:84%
A lot of different
things can happen.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:16.060 align:middle line:84%
But that's still in that
state of it's not been proven.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: You said
before something

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.200 align:middle line:84%
to the effect of
that you feel perhaps

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.330 align:middle line:84%
higher-level extraterrestrials
still have us

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:26.510 align:middle line:84%
under some kind of quarantine
or management of some kind,

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:28.616 align:middle line:84%
that even if we got
all this technology,

00:21:28.616 --> 00:21:30.740 align:middle line:84%
it's not like we could
necessarily just do whatever

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:90%
we want.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Could you explain
that a little more?

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, the
extraterrestrials, they're

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.029 align:middle line:84%
not going to just
come on down here

00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:40.820 align:middle line:84%
and give us everything
for free, because we

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:44.600 align:middle line:84%
have to evolve on
our own consciousness

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.170 align:middle line:84%
and treat each other well and
not cut each other's heads off

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.060 align:middle line:90%
and behave.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And then everyone always ask
me about the evil aliens.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, yeah,
there's evil aliens.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's good and
bad aliens and all this.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, what
are the bad ones like?

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.870 align:middle line:84%
I said, just go in the bathroom
and look in the mirror.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:05.430 align:middle line:90%


00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:06.312 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:22:06.312 --> 00:22:08.020 align:middle line:84%
I said, because we're
killing each other.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.090 align:middle line:84%
We're not supposed to
be killing each other.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Even though that's
a control thing.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.990 align:middle line:84%
We're being controlled
to do these things.

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So that being said, because
of our misbehaving sometimes--

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.580 align:middle line:90%
and they were here before.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.450 align:middle line:90%
They were like us.

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:27.520 align:middle line:84%
They evolved out of
what we are now too.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And they have come
back from the past.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Rendlesham Forest,
they've come back

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:36.230 align:middle line:84%
from the past to visit and
come out of that pyramid.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And witnessed by over 100
people I think or 33 people.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And the
message was, stop

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:48.939 align:middle line:84%
what you're doing with all
these nukes, because were

00:22:48.939 --> 00:22:50.480 align:middle line:84%
your children's
children's children's

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.771 align:middle line:90%
children's children's children.

00:22:51.771 --> 00:22:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep
doing this, we're

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:56.840 align:middle line:84%
not going to exist,
which is interesting,

00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:01.060 align:middle line:84%
because that means
there's no time.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And now you're going to be
like getting screwed around

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.890 align:middle line:84%
in your head,
thinking about that.

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.460 align:middle line:90%
But basically, there is no time.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And time is just
something that we made up

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.520 align:middle line:90%
to survive here in the 3D.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's many other
different dimensions.

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:21.559 align:middle line:84%
And we're learning how to travel
interdimensionally safely.

00:23:21.559 --> 00:23:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: What might
some of the limitations

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.810 align:middle line:84%
be that certain ETs
would impose on us

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.067 align:middle line:84%
right now that would
restrict our total freedom?

00:23:28.067 --> 00:23:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Like, what would be
some of the things

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:33.040 align:middle line:84%
that if we tried to do it
that we wouldn't succeed

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.630 align:middle line:90%
or that we would be blocked?

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I think if we try to
destroy more than 75%

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:42.190 align:middle line:84%
of the population of the
Earth, they will intervene.

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:47.630 align:middle line:84%
I think if we try to poison
the earth permanently,

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.980 align:middle line:84%
let's say through Fukushima
or our own accident,

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.080 align:middle line:90%
they will intervene.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.290 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's things
like this where,

00:23:55.290 --> 00:24:01.960 align:middle line:84%
if it's going to be a
complete, mass de-populization

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:08.770 align:middle line:84%
or we're really killing more
than 75% of humans or animals

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:11.440 align:middle line:84%
on the planet,
including the oceans,

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.680 align:middle line:84%
that there will be
definite intervention.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if any type of
nuclear missile or backpack

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.830 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is is
activated that would destroy

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:30.260 align:middle line:84%
more than 75% of the
population of the Earth,

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.940 align:middle line:90%
they will intervene.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.270 align:middle line:90%
So not to say one would.

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:39.530 align:middle line:84%
But all it takes is one of
those to go off and contaminate

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:40.330 align:middle line:90%
the atmosphere.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:43.552 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
have a rough 50 years.

00:24:43.552 --> 00:24:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, it also
seems like there's

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.000 align:middle line:84%
a lot of other people living
here besides us, maybe not

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:48.800 align:middle line:90%
the surface.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.030 align:middle line:90%
But they're definitely here.

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's right.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And they
don't want their land

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.810 align:middle line:90%
to be damaged either.

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That is correct, yes.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:84%
So there's other
extraterrestrial beings

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.020 align:middle line:90%
that live within the Earth.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:06.350 align:middle line:84%
There's also ancient beings
that have lived here forever,

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.830 align:middle line:84%
not extraterrestrial, but
they've just been here,

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:13.030 align:middle line:84%
probably since the dawn of
time, the Inner Earth beings.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's something we could
talk about on a different show.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:18.755 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Sure.

00:25:18.755 --> 00:25:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you mentioned
these traversable aquifers

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:29.030 align:middle line:84%
under the oceans or under the
continents, one of the things I

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:32.300 align:middle line:84%
was reminded of was a
briefing that Cory got,

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:36.950 align:middle line:84%
something he actually saw,
which was these massive halls,

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:38.660 align:middle line:84%
kind of flat on the
bottom, rounded off

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:42.200 align:middle line:84%
at the top very, very
large, underwater

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.860 align:middle line:84%
that you could actually
sail a submarine through.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And they were very straight and
went over very long distances.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And that apparently, some of
our guys used one of those

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:57.350 align:middle line:84%
to get to Antarctica
from further up north.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:01.175 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering if you've heard
about buildouts and tunnels?

00:26:01.175 --> 00:26:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.765 align:middle line:90%
They're man-made though.

00:26:04.765 --> 00:26:07.156 align:middle line:90%
They weren't made by the Earth.

00:26:07.156 --> 00:26:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Well, they
are ancient though.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.200 align:middle line:84%
They're not made by
our humans, right?

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.040 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm saying.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: OK.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Yeah.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.320 align:middle line:90%
That's what he meant, yeah.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There's caverns that
they found in North America

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.860 align:middle line:84%
and Mexico that go
straight through the Earth

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.840 align:middle line:90%
towards Antarctica.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And those caverns have been
modified, I don't know by who

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.540 align:middle line:90%
or when.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.850 align:middle line:84%
But they've been
modified into lava tubes,

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:39.890 align:middle line:84%
like perfect, large,
football field-size tubes

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:45.700 align:middle line:84%
that these submarines and
other modes of transportation,

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.980 align:middle line:84%
very high-speed by the
way, in these waterways.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.880 align:middle line:90%
It's its own traffic.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.480 align:middle line:84%
That does go not only to
Antarctica but all the way back

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.320 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Back around to where?

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: To the same spot.

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: To the Americas?

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Without
getting near the core.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:04.834 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: Do they have any idea
when they were built or by who?

00:27:04.834 --> 00:27:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I don't know
the history of it.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.440 align:middle line:84%
I just know they exist,
through satellite imagery

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and through radar and
through briefings.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And these tunnels
that are the larger ones that

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:22.190 align:middle line:84%
go to Antarctica, are they
all submerged in water,

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:24.440 align:middle line:84%
or are some of them
just voids that

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.050 align:middle line:90%
are in the land that have air?

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They are small
parts of tunnels that go

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.745 align:middle line:90%
to cavern to cavern to cavern.

00:27:32.745 --> 00:27:34.370 align:middle line:84%
But they all are
connected to a cavern,

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:35.864 align:middle line:90%
and they all are full of water.

00:27:35.864 --> 00:27:36.664 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Oh.

00:27:36.664 --> 00:27:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yep.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: And the caverns
are full of water too?

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Really?

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:44.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a giant aquifer, like I was
telling you that's connected.

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.479 align:middle line:84%
And I think, because
of these tunnels,

00:27:46.479 --> 00:27:48.020 align:middle line:84%
that there's been
infiltration to all

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.551 align:middle line:90%
the aquifers of the planet.

00:27:49.551 --> 00:27:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID: One of the briefings
I got from Pete Peterson

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:56.020 align:middle line:84%
recently was that some
elements of the Alliance

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.080 align:middle line:84%
are worried about the
habitability of the surface

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.170 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, and that
they've started pumping out

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:05.260 align:middle line:84%
some of these very large
caverns underground

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.590 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have more space
for people when they will need

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.690 align:middle line:84%
it, and that one
of the side effects

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:14.740 align:middle line:84%
has been that all these weird
creatures that shouldn't exist

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.680 align:middle line:90%
are washing up on the shoreline.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering if
you've heard anything

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.810 align:middle line:84%
about that particular
plan or that operation?

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I do know about the
build-out of caverns, 100%.

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.800 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And the pumping out of these
caverns and sealing them off,

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:30.331 align:middle line:90%
that's true.

00:28:30.331 --> 00:28:32.830 align:middle line:84%
As far as the beings coming up
from Inner Earth or something

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:35.620 align:middle line:84%
like that, I don't
doubt it, because there

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:43.460 align:middle line:84%
are inner atmospheres in the
Earth with their own lifeforms

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.860 align:middle line:84%
that have never been discovered
or told to the population.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:51.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's very possible
that, in a cavern

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.550 align:middle line:84%
that has its own spring,
that one of these things

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:57.390 align:middle line:84%
came up from its own world and
then made it to the surface.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
every day, they're

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:03.000 align:middle line:84%
discovering in the oceans
a new form of plankton

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.047 align:middle line:84%
and bacteria and
things like that.

00:29:05.047 --> 00:29:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Every day, they're
making discoveries.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And every day, we're also
having a loss of life,

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.950 align:middle line:90%
of different species.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting
that right now,

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.790 align:middle line:84%
especially the things that
are coming down from space.

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:22.170 align:middle line:84%
We have these giant satellites
in space that just collect.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:25.230 align:middle line:90%
It's like a giant air filter.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.500 align:middle line:90%
And they send these things up.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.390 align:middle line:90%
And they come back down.

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll send the
weather balloons up,

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.380 align:middle line:90%
and they get all filled.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And they have these
amazing new bacteria

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:32.665 align:middle line:90%
that's never published.

00:29:32.665 --> 00:29:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Very cool.

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That is from space.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And just like we were
talking about that water bear

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:39.879 align:middle line:90%
guy-- what's that guy called?

00:29:39.879 --> 00:29:40.753 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVID: Tardigrades.

00:29:40.753 --> 00:29:41.820 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Tardigrades.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.330 align:middle line:10%
They live in the
vacuum of space.

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:44.850 align:middle line:10%
And they come back
and they're fine.

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:45.640 align:middle line:90%
These are amazing things too.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.662 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Still alive.

00:29:46.662 --> 00:29:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And I was part of
some of those projects too

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.670 align:middle line:84%
where they're trying to find
out how we could be like that.

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Right.

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:55.952 align:middle line:90%


00:29:55.952 --> 00:29:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, even though you
said there's no time,

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:59.100 align:middle line:90%
we are out of time this episode.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:29:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, OK.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: So come back next time.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: All right.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, thanks for having me.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID: Thank you.

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:04.900 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for watching.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.180 align:middle line:90%
