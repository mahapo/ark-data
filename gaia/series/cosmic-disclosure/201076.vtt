00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are talking with Ricardo

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.870 align:middle line:10%
Gonzalez, a researcher
and a author from Peru,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.320 align:middle line:10%
who has experienced multiple
direct contacts with

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.560 align:middle line:10%
an extraterrestrial species
called the Apunians.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.900 align:middle line:90%
Ricardo, welcome.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Ricardo, why don't you tell us
a little bit about yourself,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.410 align:middle line:84%
since you're new to
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I consider that the
contact experiences are linked

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.370 align:middle line:84%
to our opening awareness
of our true nature.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And these experiences
are revealing

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.300 align:middle line:84%
that we indeed have a lot
to learn about our history.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.110 align:middle line:84%
In my own experience of
contact, which began in Peru,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.330 align:middle line:84%
I started to learn
this step by step,

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.180 align:middle line:84%
that there was a history
that linked us to entities

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:90%
that were not human.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And to the extent that
us humans become aware

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.710 align:middle line:84%
of this cosmic link,
of this history,

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.320 align:middle line:90%
we will become more free.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>> You've had multiple
direct contacts with

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.230 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And you've talked about
this in your books.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.760 align:middle line:84%
I've watched a
couple of your shows.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, tell us about that.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Along these years, I've had
contact that is physical with

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:90%
these ETs.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And these ETs had
a human aspect,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.200 align:middle line:84%
when I first became
aware of them

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:90%
and had contact in my country.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I have talked about this
many times in interviews

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.620 align:middle line:84%
in my books, but
the emotion that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.460 align:middle line:84%
surrounds this type of contact
is extraordinary and always

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.530 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.820 align:middle line:84%
It began in my infancy, first,
as I saw anomalies in the sky.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, it had
no real importance to me,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.890 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't know
what it was about.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Then, the sightings
returned, when

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.800 align:middle line:84%
I was a teenager, an
adolescent, in around 1988.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.163 align:middle line:90%
>> Was this in Peru?

00:02:05.163 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>> This happened in Peru.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.039 align:middle line:90%
This is where it all began.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.440 align:middle line:84%
At that time, the
media in Peru began

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.800 align:middle line:84%
to speak about a wave of
sightings that had occurred.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And this coincided
with what I had seen.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And so then, gradually, I began
to investigate the phenomena,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.560 align:middle line:84%
until it peaked in my
own physical contact

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.210 align:middle line:90%
with these beings.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.160 align:middle line:84%
It was a very difficult
process for me,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160 align:middle line:84%
because I had to let
go of many things.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:84%
I lost my job and I was fired,
because I went on television

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.470 align:middle line:90%
to speak about my experience.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Then, I had to leave
the career that I

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.060 align:middle line:84%
had gone to school for, which
was business administration

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.350 align:middle line:90%
and marketing.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to take
this on full time.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.490 align:middle line:84%
As I said, the year
1988 was very important.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:84%
However, I did not
meet these beings

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:90%
physically until the year 1997.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.310 align:middle line:84%
That time, I was 23
years old and the contact

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.090 align:middle line:84%
happened at a desert that is
south of the city of Lima.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Which desert is that?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>> The name of the
desert is Chilca.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.170 align:middle line:84%
It is about 60 kilometers
south of the capital.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a place that has a
history of a lot of sightings,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.190 align:middle line:84%
old history of many
sightings there.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.090 align:middle line:10%
In my investigation of this
special region of Peru,

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.610 align:middle line:10%
it was an old route
that connected the Andes

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.900 align:middle line:10%
with the Pachacamac oracle.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.800 align:middle line:10%
And the oracle, Pachacamac,
was the most important Oracle

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.720 align:middle line:10%
for the Incas in the coastline.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.960 align:middle line:10%
And many of the sacred roads
that came down from the Incas,

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.180 align:middle line:10%
from the mountains, went
through this desert.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.070 align:middle line:10%
So I was called to this place.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.100 align:middle line:10%
And that was the first time
that I saw one of these beings.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you tell us a
little bit more about that?

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The entity that called
me there telepathically,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.650 align:middle line:84%
his name was [? Anterelle. ?]
And he showed up at the desert

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.540 align:middle line:84%
at the same time that
he had asked me to come.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And previous to him showing
up, we had all their sightings

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:84%
in that same place that were
seen by other people that

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.270 align:middle line:90%
were there with me that night.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I am so aware of
this, as you know,

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:84%
because I've done these types
of contact work all around

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.050 align:middle line:90%
the world as well.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And it is something
that we teach

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.700 align:middle line:84%
the students and
everyone, that there

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.600 align:middle line:84%
should be someone, part of the
team, that has some experience

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.880 align:middle line:90%
and already has been contacted.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.174 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that we're
better than anyone.

00:04:22.174 --> 00:04:24.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not like that,
because anyone can do it.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.010 align:middle line:84%
But there is a collective
consciousness, like you said,

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.630 align:middle line:84%
of a team leader that,
when that energy,

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking about
telepathy and the downloads

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.190 align:middle line:84%
that you have with
the communication,

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.220 align:middle line:84%
actually is transdimensionally
sent to the people that

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.900 align:middle line:90%
are with you.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.160 align:middle line:90%
Is this correct?

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>> There's this type of a
collective communion between

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.390 align:middle line:84%
the witnesses, where our minds
are not just a passive witness,

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.900 align:middle line:84%
but it also interacts
with their mind.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.780 align:middle line:84%
I understood this when the
ET started talking to us

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:90%
about a needed preparation.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a preparation that is based
on mind techniques, control

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:90%
techniques.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a means of trying to manage
our fears against the unknown.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.190 align:middle line:84%
But including somebody
with military training

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.790 align:middle line:84%
could understand that there
is no training that can really

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.310 align:middle line:84%
prepare you for
unexpected things.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
contact with ETs.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you also explain to the
viewers when the contact that

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:38.730 align:middle line:84%
you make and you walk out away
from the group and you start

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.680 align:middle line:84%
the contact and then you
come back to the group,

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:84%
does the group ever talk to
you about, all of a sudden,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.080 align:middle line:84%
they are visualizing what
you have experienced or maybe

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:84%
having some sort of
activation in their--

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.950 align:middle line:84%
you can call it Kundalini
chakras, astral,

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.540 align:middle line:90%
etherical bodies.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Have they explained
anything like this?

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.050 align:middle line:90%
Because it's transformative.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a transformation
when you bring people out

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.140 align:middle line:84%
under the stars and that's
part of the education

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.390 align:middle line:90%
that you're doing.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.915 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a very interesting
question that you've asked me.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:84%
I remember that during that
first contact in the desert,

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.980 align:middle line:84%
he was a humanoid,
with Nordic appearance,

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.200 align:middle line:84%
and had a very
tight fitting suit.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually a
brief contact with him,

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.190 align:middle line:84%
because I was having a really
hard time managing my emotions.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.410 align:middle line:84%
When I returned
to that base camp,

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.110 align:middle line:84%
where my other people
were, I felt like something

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.840 align:middle line:84%
about that being
had stayed with me,

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.010 align:middle line:84%
just because of the close
proximity that I had with him.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.070 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't just a mental
issue, because of the shock.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.490 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.440 align:middle line:84%
I felt that there
was something that

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.940 align:middle line:84%
was very subtle, but
physical, was surrounding me.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And it has happened to
me during other occasions

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.490 align:middle line:84%
that, when I would come
back to the other witnesses

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.540 align:middle line:84%
after contact, people have
hugged me and welcomed me back

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:84%
and they said that I
felt very different.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.810 align:middle line:84%
They said that they could feel
an extreme static on my body.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And somebody even said that they
could see some type of sparks

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.410 align:middle line:84%
around my
electromagnetic system.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.080 align:middle line:84%
On one occasion,
my own wife did not

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.420 align:middle line:90%
recognize me when I came back.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you believe
it has to do with--

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.230 align:middle line:84%
through my experience,
the vibration, sometimes,

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:37.080 align:middle line:84%
of these extraterrestrials is so
high that we cannot handle all

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.100 align:middle line:84%
of it, but like a magnet, we
take some of that magnetism

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.450 align:middle line:90%
with us.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And it gets transferred,
sometimes for life,

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.690 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes just
for that night.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.940 align:middle line:90%
So why do you think that is?

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.610 align:middle line:84%
What is the activation
that comes with us?

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.450 align:middle line:90%
Is it genetic?

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:55.380 align:middle line:90%
Is it DNA?

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Is it the crystalline
structure of us, of who we are?

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
come back, I would

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:06.780 align:middle line:84%
like to say that, when I
come back, I am you now.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.552 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:08:09.552 --> 00:08:11.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I understand
what you're saying.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.565 align:middle line:84%
Because we actually have been
investigating the subtle impact

00:08:14.565 --> 00:08:15.365 align:middle line:90%
after contact.

00:08:15.365 --> 00:08:18.500 align:middle line:90%


00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.390 align:middle line:84%
They actually
themselves recommended

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.000 align:middle line:84%
that we research ancient
historical knowledge

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.270 align:middle line:90%
about energy and this planet.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:29.540 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning, I recognize
I didn't understand.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I felt like it was
something too mystical

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.669 align:middle line:84%
that was related to the actual
physical contact with them.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:38.960 align:middle line:90%
But I was wrong.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.480 align:middle line:84%
So I started to
investigate old traditions,

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.179 align:middle line:84%
ancient and oriental
traditions about the body

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:47.660 align:middle line:84%
and electromagnetic system
that, today, has had a very

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:90%
important scientific basis.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.610 align:middle line:84%
I began to understand that
these beings were inviting

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.130 align:middle line:84%
us to prepare for
this type of contact,

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.220 align:middle line:84%
because the frequency of
their vibrations, as you said,

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.590 align:middle line:84%
does vibrate with
more intensity.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lot like trying to
connect an appliance that you

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:84%
bought in the United States
where the voltage is 110

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to
plug it into my country,

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:84%
in Peru, where the
voltage is 220.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Boom.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>> You you need a transformer.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:84%
So in this example,
that transformer

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:84%
would be preparation
and consciousness.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And the contact
would, obviously,

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.810 align:middle line:84%
be affecting you and your DNA,
mentally and vibrationally.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>> One time, someone told
me that you are a step down

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:34.970 align:middle line:90%
transformer.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And you just
mentioned transformer.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, I believe that you are
one of these stepped down

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.910 align:middle line:84%
transformers to accept
a lot of information,

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.300 align:middle line:84%
process that information,
and give it to the public.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.580 align:middle line:90%
Would you agree?

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree with that.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And I do also agree
with the importance

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:84%
of having respect as a protocol
with this type of contact.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.290 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to invite many
journalists of the phenomena

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.300 align:middle line:90%
to my pre-programmed contact.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I've done it many
times, including

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.940 align:middle line:84%
well-known journalists and
investigators in this country.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And at a designated place
and a designated time,

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:84%
they have shown up in
front of these journalists.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And this actually created
a certain confusion

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.680 align:middle line:84%
for other investigators that
would call me and ask, well,

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.500 align:middle line:84%
when are you going to invite
me, so that I can see the UFOs?

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.780 align:middle line:90%
Like if this was entertainment.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.750 align:middle line:84%
In 27 years of
contact, I have only

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.390 align:middle line:84%
been able to invite
journalists 8 times.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Some of these
meetings have actually

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.940 align:middle line:84%
been recorded with
very interesting video.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.270 align:middle line:84%
But to the skeptics, it's like
nothing at all ever happened.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.010 align:middle line:84%
That's why, for me,
what is most important

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.470 align:middle line:84%
is the actual information
and the message.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Ricardo, who
are the Aupunians?

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And where does that
name come from?

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>> These entities, that
we call the Apunians,

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:middle line:90%
have their origin in Peru.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm referring
to is that some

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.430 align:middle line:84%
of the oldest cases
involving them

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.680 align:middle line:90%
have happened in my country.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.380 align:middle line:84%
In the 1950s, the
farmers and the shepherds

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.320 align:middle line:84%
that lived in the Andes
had contact with them.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.150 align:middle line:84%
The shepherds called
the mountains apus,

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:17.410 align:middle line:84%
which is a word that is in the
ancient language of the Incas.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Apu is the protector
spirit of the mountains.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And since these ETs do
have their base on Earth,

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.340 align:middle line:84%
in the Andes, when they would
appear before the shepherds

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and farmers, they would speak
to them in their own language,

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:31.480 align:middle line:90%
in quechua.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.030 align:middle line:84%
They would say, we come from
the apus, from the mountains.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.560 align:middle line:84%
That's why we call them
the Apunianos or Apunians,

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.500 align:middle line:84%
but also for another reason
that's no less important.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.200 align:middle line:84%
These beings affirm
that they do have

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.120 align:middle line:84%
established colonies on other
planets in Alpha Centauri.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And one of their planets
that they did colonize,

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.730 align:middle line:84%
a rocky planet, that
they called Apu,

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.890 align:middle line:84%
according to the old
traditions of Peru,

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.710 align:middle line:84%
which indicates that these
beings know very well

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.240 align:middle line:84%
the history of Earth
and are linked to it.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>> How long do you think
the Apunians have been here?

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.533 align:middle line:90%
And what do they look like?

00:12:06.533 --> 00:12:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.283 align:middle line:84%
>> According to the
information that I have,

00:12:09.283 --> 00:12:12.280 align:middle line:84%
they have participated with
us for thousands of years,

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.460 align:middle line:84%
maybe around 6,000 years,
according to the information

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.480 align:middle line:90%
that they've transmitted.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.690 align:middle line:84%
However, other groups
of ETs have, of course,

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.230 align:middle line:90%
visited way before then.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>> How did they
get here, Ricardo?

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>> They came here as part
of a scientific study.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:34.000 align:middle line:84%
They got here based on a
technology that they've been

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.880 align:middle line:90%
able to shortcut distances.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.380 align:middle line:84%
The technology they have
allows them to sort of wrinkle

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.560 align:middle line:84%
or fold space time
into itself to be

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.320 align:middle line:90%
able to get here to our planet.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they traveled
in a straight line,

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:51.970 align:middle line:84%
the four light years
away that separates

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:55.180 align:middle line:84%
the Earth from Alpha Centauri,
what is very interesting

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:84%
is that they left
tomorrow from their worlds

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:90%
and arrived yesterday here.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.920 align:middle line:84%
A part of their
scientific study is based

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:90%
on the mountains of the Earth.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Because according to
the knowledge that they

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:84%
have transmitted to us, the
mountains, and their mountain

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.870 align:middle line:84%
tops, because the water that is
found there, according to them,

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:19.290 align:middle line:84%
is very important to the Earth
and throughout the universe.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.640 align:middle line:84%
This type of study
allows them to gauge

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.760 align:middle line:84%
the health of this planet and
the processes of the Earth,

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.620 align:middle line:84%
something that is very
important to them,

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.310 align:middle line:84%
because our world is
like a university.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And our species is in
school in this university.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And everything that
humans achieve and learn

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:39.280 align:middle line:84%
in this planet will affect
them in one way or another,

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.640 align:middle line:84%
because we are connected
by a solidarity,

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.680 align:middle line:90%
a chain of evolution.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Do they look like us?

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>> They do look a lot like us.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.220 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of
human appearances

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:90%
and characteristics.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.410 align:middle line:84%
They have eyes, ears, mouth,
nose, their characteristics,

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:84%
I described, as
Nordic, because they

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.920 align:middle line:84%
remind me a lot of a
Scandinavian person or a person

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.260 align:middle line:90%
from Norway.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.280 align:middle line:84%
They have hair, both the males
in the females that we've seen.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Their hair is very light,
almost like the hair

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:90%
of an albino person.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And the men, as
well as the women,

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.090 align:middle line:90%
have their hair fairly long.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.810 align:middle line:90%
It falls onto their shoulders.

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.400 align:middle line:90%
Their eyes are pretty light.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.230 align:middle line:90%
They're beautiful.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And they are also very tall,
with different heights.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.030 align:middle line:84%
A variety from two meters
to three meters of height,

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:32.020 align:middle line:84%
their build is very
athletic, very symmetrical.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.270 align:middle line:84%
They have a very beautiful
and special appearance

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:84%
that if I had seen them
3,000 years ago on Mt.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Sinai, I would have
called them angels.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you
know, if anything,

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:46.065 align:middle line:84%
about the origins
of their culture?

00:14:46.065 --> 00:14:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>> We can say that they are the
result of a lot of different

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.110 align:middle line:90%
processes.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Life on Earth is not the
product of a coincidence.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.770 align:middle line:84%
God does not play
dice with the world.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:02.170 align:middle line:84%
There are other
intermediate hierarchies

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.980 align:middle line:84%
that played a part in
the creation of Earth.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.080 align:middle line:84%
I know that it can sound
very complex for me

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.620 align:middle line:90%
to use the word hierarchy.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So it could maybe be
deemed something religious.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.730 align:middle line:84%
But whoever's seeing
the show right now

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:19.390 align:middle line:84%
should understand just the way
that we humans are organized

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle line:84%
with these different
functions, they also are.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's a group
of these beings

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:28.050 align:middle line:84%
that we know of as
the seeders of life,

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:30.760 align:middle line:84%
that, on our planet,
a long time ago, they

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.810 align:middle line:84%

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Because we are them
and they are us.

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And our reality in this
planet that we call 3D

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.400 align:middle line:90%
is just the tip of the iceberg.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.310 align:middle line:84%

has not been the same as ours.

is interlacing and uniting.

And the luck of one
of these humanities

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.580 align:middle line:84%
could deeply affect

The mission of planet
Earth is a school planet.

The fact that other

in the seeding of life and
our continued evolution,

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.620 align:middle line:90%
it's not a whim.

could you elaborate a

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:90%
In what way?

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>> There are different ways
to interpret that phrase.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.790 align:middle line:84%
In one way, I could
speak about genetics.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Because if they seeded life
here, what did they seed?

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.100 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we are their descendants.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.530 align:middle line:84%
We could be part of a
family that we don't even

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:49.240 align:middle line:90%
know in the universe.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.460 align:middle line:84%
But if we go a
little further from

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:55.180 align:middle line:84%
the genetic interpretations
of our descendancy,

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.820 align:middle line:84%
we could feel that we are
something that is bigger

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.920 align:middle line:90%
than just bones and flesh.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And that, perhaps before we
lived as humans here on Earth,

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:07.810 align:middle line:84%
we knew these beings,
that we forgot all of this

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:90%
before we came here to Earth.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.339 align:middle line:84%
When we are attempting
to have contact

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:14.589 align:middle line:84%
with beings from
other realities,

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.880 align:middle line:90%
we're just trying to remember.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.849 align:middle line:84%
And if this wasn't
enough, there's

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:20.859 align:middle line:90%
an additional interpretation.

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:23.020 align:middle line:84%
What would happen
if I said that some

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:27.530 align:middle line:84%
of the beings that have contact
with us are us in the future?

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I truly believe that.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the things
I talk to everyone about,

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:37.360 align:middle line:84%
is that we are forever and they
are interested in us, the ETs.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.530 align:middle line:90%
We are very important.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:43.090 align:middle line:84%
We are the superheroes
of the universe.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:45.520 align:middle line:90%
And they were once us.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they're
here making sure

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.940 align:middle line:84%
we don't destroy the
planet and kill each other.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And part of that, they
have a lot of compassion.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe, with all the
stuff going on in the media,

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.640 align:middle line:84%
and all the fear based
things, I love it

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.400 align:middle line:84%
that you're against all
that, because it does not

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:08.290 align:middle line:84%
serve to worry and have the fear
of what's going on out there.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:13.240 align:middle line:84%
But to be aware of what's going
on is very important to me.

that we might have

to migrate to Alpha Centauri.

that humanity and the

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.470 align:middle line:84%
that there's still more
good than bad in the world,

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:19.280 align:middle line:84%
but the things that
we call negative

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.350 align:middle line:90%
just have more publicity.

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:23.990 align:middle line:84%
But if a certain
percentage of the species

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:28.090 align:middle line:84%
raised consciousness and
changed their conduct,

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:31.010 align:middle line:84%
we could change happenings
in this very timeline that

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.830 align:middle line:90%
would affect other timelines.

undone in the heavens.

is not disconnected to
that of the universe.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:57.500 align:middle line:84%
That's why these beings observe
us as a part of this project.

directly in our issues,

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.690 align:middle line:90%
were actually just telepathic.

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:21.080 align:middle line:84%

and concentration.

When they felt that I was ready
to have contact with them,

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:32.000 align:middle line:84%
they gave me a
place, a coordinate,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.400 align:middle line:84%
that I could meet
them face to face.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.050 align:middle line:84%
I've seen them face to
face only eight times.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of the
contact has been

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.200 align:middle line:90%
via ways that are nonphysical.

and in Peru, of course.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.900 align:middle line:84%
But yes, I do definitely
follow a protocol of contact.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And this protocol
has actually been

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:09.530 align:middle line:84%
present in the contact
phenomenon for many decades,

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:13.220 align:middle line:84%
way before J. Allen Hynek talked

and our investigations
relating to this,

these beings have multiple
purposes while here on Earth,

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:35.310 align:middle line:84%
because it's not correct to
say that they are visiting us,

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:38.470 align:middle line:84%
because they're already
living among us.

One other purpose of
coexistence with us

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.600 align:middle line:90%
is to learn from our culture.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.780 align:middle line:84%
They do have the capacity
to mutate and infiltrate

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.530 align:middle line:84%
themselves among us, just
like an anthropologist would

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.350 align:middle line:84%
integrate him or herself
within the people of the jungle

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.300 align:middle line:90%
to learn about them.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.700 align:middle line:84%
The learning regarding
human culture,

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.580 align:middle line:84%
for them, is important,
so that they can modify

I could mention the
Himalayan Mountains.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.400 align:middle line:84%
I could also speak
about the mountain range

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:10.800 align:middle line:84%
in between France and Spain
called the Pyrenees Mountains.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Here in the United
States, in particular,

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:15.750 align:middle line:84%
we have had very close
contact with these beings

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:17.730 align:middle line:90%
that we call the Apunians in Mt.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:18.660 align:middle line:90%
Shasta.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:23.970 align:middle line:84%
This is a part of the protocol
that we term neutral zones.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:27.120 align:middle line:84%
For example, if a North
American was traveling to India

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and loses his or
her passport, they

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.730 align:middle line:84%
would need to go to the embassy
to try to correct this issue.

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:36.360 align:middle line:84%
When this North American
enters that embassy in India,

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.600 align:middle line:90%
in what country is he or she in?

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.810 align:middle line:84%
When these beings invite
you by mutual will to one

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:46.720 align:middle line:84%
of the places of contact,
and the witness accepts,

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.180 align:middle line:90%
they are in a neutral zone.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:52.080 align:middle line:84%
It is a type of diplomatic place
of contact, where they are not

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.450 align:middle line:84%
transgressing our free
will, because they

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.520 align:middle line:84%
have a certain
participation in that zone

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.740 align:middle line:90%
and you're willing to go there.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm speaking only
about the positive beings that

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.080 align:middle line:90%
are respectful to humanity.

to have their main center
of operations in that place.

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:43.440 align:middle line:84%
They might say, oh, of course,
because you're Peruvian,

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.010 align:middle line:84%
you think the main
base is there.

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:45.810 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:47.220 align:middle line:90%

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.070 align:middle line:84%

thousands of points

And that place is Huascaran.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it is for
a technical reason

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.950 align:middle line:90%
that they did find that place.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.100 align:middle line:84%
We humans measure the
altitude of a mountain

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.780 align:middle line:90%
from ocean to the peak.

For example, Mt.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Everest would be
the highest mountain

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.310 align:middle line:90%
using that measurement.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:12.750 align:middle line:84%
But that is a measurement of
the mountain from the center

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:14.640 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth to the peak.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Based on that
perspective, Huascaran

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:18.360 align:middle line:90%
is a lot higher than Mt.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.410 align:middle line:90%

Huascaran has actually
lost part of its height

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:26.790 align:middle line:84%
due to avalanches
and earthquakes.

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:29.850 align:middle line:84%

the second highest mountain

in the world.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.930 align:middle line:10%

called Chimborazo, where
there is also a base.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.360 align:middle line:90%
that he was not lying.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.050 align:middle line:90%


00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:13.220 align:middle line:84%
People such as J. Allen
Hynek and Jacques Vallee

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:16.080 align:middle line:90%
have studied this case as well.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.660 align:middle line:84%
There are many
cases of witnesses

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.030 align:middle line:84%
that have met with
ETs that infiltrated

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:24.900 align:middle line:84%
our society while wearing
just a shirt and blue jeans.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Ricardo, do you believe
that the Apunians are actually

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:32.940 align:middle line:84%
living with other
humans and interacting?

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.660 align:middle line:84%
You said something about
they could be at a Starbucks.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.890 align:middle line:90%
Are they just looking from afar?

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Or are they actually really
cohabitating with us?

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>> What they're trying to
do is to coexist with us,

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.150 align:middle line:90%
but in silence.

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:50.280 align:middle line:84%
When I gave the example
of the coffee shop,

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm just illustrating
what they're able to do.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.840 align:middle line:84%
But they are actually
quite discrete

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.500 align:middle line:90%
with their participation.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Actually, not even the
witnesses of contacts

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:00.510 align:middle line:90%
can sometimes identify them.

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.640 align:middle line:84%
It isn't until there
is a further meeting

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:06.150 align:middle line:84%
in another type of surrounding,
that's human or otherwise.

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And when the contact
is over, perhaps you

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.415 align:middle line:90%
never see them again.

00:31:09.415 --> 00:31:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Where do you see their
mission heading into the future

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:13.000 align:middle line:90%
with us?

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Their mission, aside
from coexisting with us,

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:21.630 align:middle line:84%
to learn from us, is to
warn us about the future.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Because as I
mentioned, our destiny

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:28.970 align:middle line:84%
is linked to many other
creatures in this universe.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:34.400 align:middle line:84%
They consider that human
beings hold a key, a potential

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.280 align:middle line:90%
that not even they have.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a potential that
human beings have not yet

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.720 align:middle line:84%
completely discovered
and that we can only

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.470 align:middle line:84%
awaken based on good behavior
and coexistence among us.

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:47.600 align:middle line:84%
This is why they're
wanting to warn us

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.880 align:middle line:84%
about the importance of
our treatment of each other

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.220 align:middle line:84%
and our treatment of the
planet, because we could

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.110 align:middle line:90%
be risking our own survival.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Will they ever intervene
if there's going to be a major

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:00.680 align:middle line:84%
catastrophe of half of the
planet being destroyed or half

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.170 align:middle line:84%
of the population
being destroyed?

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Or are they just going to leave?

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a mixture of factors
that could occur in the future.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.470 align:middle line:84%
In one way, one factor
is what the human being

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:15.170 align:middle line:84%
would do to himself
on the planet,

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:17.960 align:middle line:84%
contamination of the world,
misuse of technology,

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.510 align:middle line:84%
overpopulation, and
poor administration

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:21.800 align:middle line:90%
of our resources.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.950 align:middle line:84%
A negative distribution of
the resources to humans,

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:28.310 align:middle line:84%
poor sensibility to other
inhabitants of this planet,

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and not just humans, but
animals and vegetation,

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:35.270 align:middle line:84%
all of our progress is based
on accumulating more wealth.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:37.670 align:middle line:84%
We have technology
that communicates more,

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:40.010 align:middle line:90%
that makes us less sensitive.

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.230 align:middle line:84%
All of this begins
to become a mixture.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's making us into zombies.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:46.910 align:middle line:90%
So there is one danger.

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:48.890 align:middle line:84%
The other risk that
they warn us about

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:52.280 align:middle line:84%
is that we are too
distracted by conflicts.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.910 align:middle line:84%
We will not be united as we
might face threats from space.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking about an
invasion like the Hollywood

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:00.470 align:middle line:90%
movie regarding ETs.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:04.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
impacts from asteroids.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Any person that is
halfway informed

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.150 align:middle line:84%
knows that in these
last years, a lot

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:12.020 align:middle line:84%
of space agencies from Earth are
developing multimillion dollar

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:16.700 align:middle line:84%
projects to be able to identify,
destroy, or detour celestial

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.310 align:middle line:84%
bodies that could
possibly impact us.

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:22.227 align:middle line:84%
According to the Apunians,
this type of threat is real.

00:33:22.227 --> 00:33:23.810 align:middle line:84%
If all of these
things were to happen,

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:26.480 align:middle line:84%
our coexistence and
ability to survive on Earth

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.100 align:middle line:90%
would be impossible.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Then, the ones that
could escape the planet

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.960 align:middle line:84%
would be able to do
so with new technology

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.810 align:middle line:84%
and with a destiny that would
be appropriate to travel

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:37.460 align:middle line:90%
to Alpha Centauri.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.890 align:middle line:84%
The scientists of Earth have
already considered this.

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:41.570 align:middle line:90%
We've spoken about this.

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:44.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the secret space program
towards Alpha Centauri.

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And the ETs say that there's
nothing wrong with human beings

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.720 align:middle line:84%
exploring the cosmos and
even colonizing other worlds.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.530 align:middle line:84%
The problem is to abandon this
world in an emergency state,

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:56.180 align:middle line:84%
because then we've
learned nothing.

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.830 align:middle line:84%
We didn't do things
in the right way,

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.360 align:middle line:84%
but I do believe
that there is still

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.490 align:middle line:84%
time to be able to
change our destiny.

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>> When do you think you'll
meet the Apunians again?

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that they decided
to have further contact with me

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:14.980 align:middle line:84%
for a very powerful reason
and not because I'm a special

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.050 align:middle line:90%
person or even a chosen person.

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:20.260 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that they
felt that I would continue

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.840 align:middle line:84%
to move forward, that I
would be willing to be

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.489 align:middle line:84%
a communicator of
these experiences.

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Because while it is true, that
these beings have contacted

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.730 align:middle line:84%
people that have
a lot of authority

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:34.929 align:middle line:84%
in military or in their jobs,
these groups of people that we

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:37.389 align:middle line:84%
call those of high
credibility, they

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:40.090 align:middle line:84%
tend to not talk about
these experiences.

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And the ETs say that
the common witnesses

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.530 align:middle line:90%
will reach the common people.

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And it is the common people
that have always made

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.989 align:middle line:90%
the huge changes in the planet.

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:51.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm just a common
person that talks

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.308 align:middle line:84%
about an extraordinary
experience.

00:34:54.308 --> 00:34:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And the people that are
now listening or watching

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:59.950 align:middle line:84%
that possibly know these things
or have had their own contact,

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:02.780 align:middle line:84%
will hopefully feel less
alone as they listen to me.

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree, Ricardo.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's going to be the
lay person around the planet,

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:12.550 align:middle line:84%
not some government
agency or military,

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:15.850 align:middle line:84%
because they're so restricted
on what they can do.

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:16.810 align:middle line:90%
But we are not.

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:20.710 align:middle line:84%
We are free to go amongst the
planet and amongst the stars

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and to make contact
by our own free will.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Ricardo, thank you
for being on the show.

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.210 align:middle line:84%
It's been a fascinating
account of your story.

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much,
Emery, for this interview.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>> My name's Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.220 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:49.000 align:middle line:90%
