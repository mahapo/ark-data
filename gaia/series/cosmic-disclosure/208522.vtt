00:00:20.273 --> 00:00:22.190 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY SMITH: Today,
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.820 align:middle line:10%
we're with Tim, a tactical
advisor in covert governance

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:10%
in Germany who analyzes and
suggests various strategies

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:10%
in relation to extraterrestrial
groups in contact with Earth.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.062 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.062 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Thanks for having me.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What can you
tell us about the moon?

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.480 align:middle line:90%
Is it natural?

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Is it artificial?

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: It's a ship.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:51.770 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to be an object
that is built and brought

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.390 align:middle line:84%
into the atmosphere of the Earth
in order to have some effect.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.520 align:middle line:84%
So I have two different
perspectives on the moon.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.870 align:middle line:84%
One comes from the Greys,
and one comes from Being 6.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:84%
They both have their
own take on the moon,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.840 align:middle line:84%
on the history of the moon,
the importance of the moon,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.600 align:middle line:84%
but one thing they
both agree upon

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.730 align:middle line:90%
is the significance of the moon.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.980 align:middle line:90%
It seems to be super important.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And quoting the Greys here, it's
the key to ascension of Earth.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What is the
history of the moon?

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So we have two
perspectives on that.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:84%
The Greys, from their
viewpoint, the moon

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.560 align:middle line:90%
has been brought to the Earth.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.930 align:middle line:84%
It also had one functionality,
which I cannot talk about right

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.850 align:middle line:90%
now, but maybe later.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And it initiated the
contact between Earth people

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.160 align:middle line:90%
and non-terrestrial beings.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So it also seems to
operate as a base

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.720 align:middle line:84%
for different types
of species of groups

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.940 align:middle line:90%
that are located there.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.110 align:middle line:84%
One thing that needs to be
in the mind of the people

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.390 align:middle line:84%
is that there's no other
moon in all of our system

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.060 align:middle line:90%
that is as round as our moon.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.420 align:middle line:84%
So normally, moons
have the tendency

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.870 align:middle line:84%
to build clusters, which means
they form in irregular ways,

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.240 align:middle line:90%
maybe like rocks or something.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.150 align:middle line:90%
So they are not perfectly round.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.810 align:middle line:84%
This is the only
moon, the only moon

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:84%
that we have in the system
that is perfectly roundish.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And it also-- and that
might be important

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:84%
when we come to the perspective
of Being 6 to the moon's

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:84%
function, even it's
closer to the Earth,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.760 align:middle line:90%
it is the same size as the sun.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.980 align:middle line:84%
So moon and sun, they
both overlap perfectly.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What is
the role of the moon?

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.960 align:middle line:90%
Why'd they put it there?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:90%
What's the function of it?

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So I personally think
that this is a Dyson sphere,

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.400 align:middle line:84%
which means it's a roundish
ship that is built around,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.620 align:middle line:84%
for example, an artificial sun
or a natural sun or natural

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.390 align:middle line:84%
star or something that is giving
energy to the moon's system.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that for sure.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.390 align:middle line:84%
But what the Greys are
saying is that some species--

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.030 align:middle line:84%
and at that point,
at least, I don't

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.920 align:middle line:90%
know what species did that.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.290 align:middle line:84%
It must be way back, way back,
and brought the moon close

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:84%
to Earth, and by that,
initiated the contact.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Through that, we have a
denaturalized influence

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.590 align:middle line:84%
upon Earth which brought Earth
into some kind of chaos, which

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:84%
means different influences from
outside of the Earth system

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.480 align:middle line:90%
came into the system.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And the history of
humanity, at least,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.040 align:middle line:84%
what the Greys is saying, is
that brought, well, influences

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:84%
to the people on
Earth, but also,

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.370 align:middle line:84%
made it destabilized and
more affected by chaos

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.910 align:middle line:84%
so that at one time or another,
all the influences, which

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.160 align:middle line:84%
means all the
non-terrestrial people,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:84%
all other people that have been
in contact with ancient people

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.350 align:middle line:84%
moved outside and went away
from the surface of the Earth

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.030 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring
some natural evolution

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.040 align:middle line:84%
to the planet, or at
least, the opportunity

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:90%
to naturally evolve.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You speak of
the influence the moon has

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.670 align:middle line:90%
Can you elaborate?

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:90%
Like, what influence?

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.230 align:middle line:90%
Is there a special energy?

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Are they emitting
something down to us?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Right now, it
seems that the moon is used

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.530 align:middle line:84%
as an operation base, which
means that a lunar base is

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:90%
stationed upon the moon.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Back then, it seems
that the moon,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.970 align:middle line:84%
at least from what
the Greys said,

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.490 align:middle line:90%
was the initiator to contact.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Being 6, as a life form
that is living outside

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.190 align:middle line:84%
of the way we
perceive time, which

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.210 align:middle line:84%
means it's outside of time
and outside of dimension,

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.930 align:middle line:84%
it has a different take upon
the moon which is totally

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.580 align:middle line:84%
the perspective of them in
comparison to the Grey thing

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.720 align:middle line:90%
is totally different.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:84%
They concentrate
upon the relationship

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.500 align:middle line:84%
from the sun and the moon
as two opposing energies,

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.970 align:middle line:90%
which means--

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.350 align:middle line:84%
and I want to make that as
visualizable as possible.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.090 align:middle line:84%
They see that everything in the
universe as this kind of sun

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.870 align:middle line:84%
source light thing,
and at some points,

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:84%
we have those clusters or
reality clouds that kind of

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.230 align:middle line:84%
are darkish and have
some kind of paradox

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.660 align:middle line:84%
in order to solve
to be decided upon.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.470 align:middle line:84%
From their perspective,
they see the Earth

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.330 align:middle line:84%
as the only planet
in the universe.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:84%
When they concentrate
upon that, they

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.430 align:middle line:84%
talk about like, a
tube system, where

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.120 align:middle line:84%
you have at one ending, the sun,
and at one ending, the moon,

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.460 align:middle line:84%
the sun resembling like,
the natural source,

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.560 align:middle line:84%
the first manifestation
of source,

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:54.610 align:middle line:84%
while the moon is manifestating
the inside affects,

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.720 align:middle line:84%
the inside logics, the
manipulation in some kind

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.960 align:middle line:84%
of way that we have when
we're inside of the system,

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.700 align:middle line:90%
inside of reality.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.810 align:middle line:84%
So they see the sun
and the moon as kind

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.860 align:middle line:84%
of the male and female
energy inside of that tube,

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.270 align:middle line:84%
while the effect of that is
that in the middle of it,

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:90%
it creates Earth as a child.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So they-- because
they are pretty,

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.130 align:middle line:84%
they have a different
take upon that.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.710 align:middle line:84%
They are more
philosophical, maybe.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:34.900 align:middle line:84%
They see a tube with two ends,
a plus and a minus polarization,

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.560 align:middle line:84%
which forms kind of an
energy, and in the middle

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.890 align:middle line:84%
of that energy flow from
one pole to another,

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.420 align:middle line:90%
we have a life form.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And we, as the people
of this planet,

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.930 align:middle line:90%
we are the planet to them.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So the child is not everyone
on the Earth itself,

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.457 align:middle line:84%
but it's the planet
itself is the child.

00:07:58.457 --> 00:08:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So do they believe
that the moon is natural?

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: No.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:06.100 align:middle line:84%
They believe that the
moon is the manifestation

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.410 align:middle line:84%
of manipulation
inside of the system.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Which means the
sun is the representative

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:21.790 align:middle line:84%
of the source of a field that
is natural and everywhere

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and everything all at once,
while the moon is something

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:32.590 align:middle line:84%
that represents the effects
of moving inside of reality

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:34.990 align:middle line:90%
and manipulating something.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And they also say
that by this kind

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.150 align:middle line:84%
of denaturalized
phenomenon, there

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.820 align:middle line:84%
is this imbalance between
female and male energy

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.880 align:middle line:84%
which creates kind of
the chaos on Earth.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.930 align:middle line:84%
That is the take and the
perspective Being 6 has.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:09:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And for them, it's
everything that

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:05.740 align:middle line:84%
is necessary in order
to make the Earth a life

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.450 align:middle line:90%
form in itself.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, what are
the effects of the moon

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.470 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth and on
the people of Earth?

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:21.340 align:middle line:84%
The moon seen as an initiator
of the contact from one species

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.750 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth people.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:25.430 align:middle line:84%
That is one of the
main functions,

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.100 align:middle line:90%
at least what the Greys said.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:32.650 align:middle line:84%
There is also an effect that the
moon has which I cannot reveal

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:84%
yet, but we can see that the
moon has a lot of effects

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:43.190 align:middle line:84%
on waves and tides on the
surface of the planet.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:47.920 align:middle line:84%
It has a lot to do with
the way water operates.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.410 align:middle line:84%
One thing I am not
sure right now,

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.450 align:middle line:84%
because the
significance of the moon

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:56.140 align:middle line:84%
is what every
species agrees upon.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:02.530 align:middle line:84%
So there seems to be a huge,
tremendous effect upon Earth.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:04.960 align:middle line:84%
One thing I don't
know at that moment

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.950 align:middle line:84%
is, is that effect benevolent
or it's hindering something?

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.840 align:middle line:84%
In one case, it could be
beneficial to provide life

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:19.000 align:middle line:84%
on Earth through the energies
that, you know, get started,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.690 align:middle line:84%
initiated by the
field of the moon.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.150 align:middle line:84%
You have the tides,
you have the water.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And also, inside of us,
because every human body

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:90%
is at least about 80% of water.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:39.460 align:middle line:84%
So the effect is directly
influencing the body.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:46.720 align:middle line:84%
But it could also be that it
denaturalizes the human bodies.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And it might be the
case that it would

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:55.420 align:middle line:84%
be better and beneficial for
the evolution of the bodies

00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:00.130 align:middle line:84%
to remove the moon or even to
shut down whatever's there.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.710 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure at
that moment if it's

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.780 align:middle line:90%
beneficial or malevolent.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Right.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Working-- this has
been documented

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:12.970 align:middle line:84%
working in the emergency
room, and also in the wards

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:18.760 align:middle line:84%
where they deliver babies, and
also working with local police

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.360 align:middle line:84%
law enforcement, it
seems that crime goes up

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.980 align:middle line:90%
when there's a full moon.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:31.180 align:middle line:84%
We also have a large influx
of trauma at the hospitals

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.520 align:middle line:90%
during a full moon.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Could you explain what
that phenomena is?

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: The
perspective of Being 6,

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:45.160 align:middle line:84%
because they look upon it
more philosophically and have

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.300 align:middle line:84%
a different perspective upon it,
less hands-on, less technical,

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle line:84%
more philosophical, so they say
the way birth appears as it is

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:02.020 align:middle line:84%
happening on Earth
with mammals and stuff,

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:84%
that is something that
brings trauma to the species.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Because naturally,
everything in the universe

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:15.010 align:middle line:84%
is created outside of
itself, but it's not

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:21.010 align:middle line:84%
that traumatic, that one host,
in some kind of way, that

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:84%
is hosting the baby is
taking material of itself,

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and by trauma, getting
the baby into life.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:38.380 align:middle line:84%
So they have this thought
that male and female energies

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.230 align:middle line:90%
are kind of in an imbalance.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.470 align:middle line:84%
The best I could
describe it is the story,

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.400 align:middle line:84%
again, we have in the
Vedas, where the male--

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.170 align:middle line:84%
the female wants the baby, wants
the creation of the universe,

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:58.680 align:middle line:84%
and the male part
doesn't agree that much

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:04.590 align:middle line:84%
to have a baby because it
feels that-- the male one feels

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:09.870 align:middle line:84%
distracted from the love that
the universe radiates and is

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.870 align:middle line:84%
in every moment, and
through that, you

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:18.600 align:middle line:84%
have this imbalance and conflict
upon the child that is created.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And it needs to be-- from
the perspective, at least,

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.590 align:middle line:90%
from Being 6.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And you need to remember it's
a level 6 consciousness being.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.190 align:middle line:90%
They don't care about politics.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:middle line:84%
They don't care
about technology.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:36.420 align:middle line:84%
What they care about is
energy coming in harmony

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and being balanced,
paradox being resolved.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:45.090 align:middle line:84%
That is their take upon reality
and how they perceive that.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And they see the struggle
of the male energy that

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.490 align:middle line:84%
feels disconnected to
life, and through that,

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:59.940 align:middle line:84%
needs to fight and to manipulate
and to achieve something

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:04.470 align:middle line:84%
in life to be worthy of
love while love is actually

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:08.250 align:middle line:84%
our natural and most
stable level of being.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:84%
So that is where
they are concerned,

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:16.260 align:middle line:84%
that the moon brings some
denaturalized paradox

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.380 align:middle line:84%
to the balance of
male and female.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.680 align:middle line:84%
But through that,
creation is happening.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:29.790 align:middle line:84%
So we need in some kind of
way the moon and the male part

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.910 align:middle line:84%
in order to have the
situation we have,

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:37.050 align:middle line:84%
but we also need
to develop in a way

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.620 align:middle line:84%
that we get over that
in some way or another.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is the moon affecting
us naturally or artificially?

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So it seems, at least
to the perspective of Being 6,

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:54.280 align:middle line:84%
again, as being outside of
time, outside of dimension,

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.370 align:middle line:84%
having a different take upon
reality and a different focus

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:84%
in life, they say it's an
unnatural force that is

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.510 align:middle line:84%
affecting the natural
evolution of Earth.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:11.200 align:middle line:84%
So naturally, Earth
would have had

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.800 align:middle line:84%
a different
evolutionary path that

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.070 align:middle line:84%
would have been the mission
or the plan of source

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.430 align:middle line:90%
for whatever happens on Earth.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.740 align:middle line:90%
And by the moon bringing--

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:32.350 align:middle line:84%
brought in it denaturalized the
evolution and the path of Earth

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and brings in some kind
of unnatural influence.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.980 align:middle line:90%
Which doesn't mean it's bad.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.300 align:middle line:84%
It just means it
creates a paradox,

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.360 align:middle line:90%
a chaos that creates life.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And we can, you know, see
that as a metaphor for life

00:15:52.660 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:84%
being in the source state as
something that is harmonious,

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:08.810 align:middle line:84%
connected, and solved, while
when we, inside of life; inside

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:12.380 align:middle line:84%
of our own experience,
through everything we do,

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.860 align:middle line:84%
we affect and influence
something, and through that,

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:20.480 align:middle line:84%
we create chaos, but
it's also the way life

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.860 align:middle line:84%
generates new experience,
through this interaction.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I might do something
while I'm inside

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:34.250 align:middle line:84%
of creation that affects someone
else, like, randomly, but it

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:38.540 align:middle line:84%
creates these new patterns
to reality, and through that,

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.090 align:middle line:84%
life grows and life
can experience things.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:90%
But it's also kind of chaos.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Because in the natural
state of the universe,

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.000 align:middle line:84%
everything is in
perfect balance.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.420 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to be done,
nothing to achieve, nothing

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:84%
to see or experience
because it's all unfolded.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:01.850 align:middle line:84%
But the moon is representing,
at least for Being 6,

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:09.700 align:middle line:84%
the chaotic influences of
beings inside of reality.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What would happen
if we did not have a moon?

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Good question.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:84%
I'd say that the evolution
on Earth would be different.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:25.119 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we'd not even
have beings here.

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:30.930 align:middle line:84%
So what we know is
that some of the most

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:35.010 align:middle line:84%
evolved races in
the universe, their

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:84%
take upon it is that
the universe seemed

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:44.640 align:middle line:84%
to be a huge space with
uninhabited planetary bodies,

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:84%
and through bringing all these,
you know, influences inside,

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:54.330 align:middle line:84%
into planetary systems,
they created life forms,

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:59.040 align:middle line:84%
they created other consciousness
units that affect each other,

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and through that, you have a lot
of chaos, but also, experience.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.520 align:middle line:10%
And when we bring that
back to the Vedas,

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:10%
you probably know that
they have this god called

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.580 align:middle line:10%
Brahma which is the creator.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:15.060 align:middle line:10%
It is kind of--the
creation itself,

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.340 align:middle line:10%
it is the consciousness unit.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And they say that Brahma
brings trouble and chaos,

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:29.580 align:middle line:84%
and it also brings, you know,
the struggle and the imbalance.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:33.630 align:middle line:84%
But without Brahma, there
wouldn't be a creation at all.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.420 align:middle line:84%
There would be nothing to
do, nothing to learn from,

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.560 align:middle line:90%
nothing to experience.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So that take upon the moon is
that it's a unnatural force

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and unnatural influence
upon the Earth,

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:51.090 align:middle line:84%
but through that male and
female energy, through that,

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:55.410 align:middle line:84%
we create what we
have now upon Earth.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So you're saying it
creates a type of homeostasis

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.660 align:middle line:84%
on Earth because the
moon is in place?

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.450 align:middle line:90%
So it's, you know, balanced?

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: It's the
other way around.

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.410 align:middle line:84%
You would have a
natural homeostasis

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.060 align:middle line:90%
if the moon wouldn't be there.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:16.060 align:middle line:84%
But probably, Earth
wouldn't have life at all.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: OK.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: So, yeah.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Tim, do we know
anything about the dark side

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.000 align:middle line:90%
of the moon?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: It's allegedly, we
have operational bases upon

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:32.580 align:middle line:84%
the-- on the moon, and it seems
as if other species also have

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.790 align:middle line:90%
operational bases on the moon.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: We being us on Earth?

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Earth people have operational
bases on the moon.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And other species seem
to have those bases

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:52.350 align:middle line:84%
too so that they can go inside
of the gravitational field

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:57.840 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, and as well,
going outside of the Earth.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And how did you
receive this information?

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So there's a lot of talk
about the bases on the moon,

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.790 align:middle line:84%
the operational bases, and
that's how I perceive it

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:12.480 align:middle line:90%
and how I've acknowledged that.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.950 align:middle line:90%
Again, I've never been there.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You saw some
documentation from your--

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.410 align:middle line:84%
So documents say-- they
mentioned the moon.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And through that,
I interpret that

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.720 align:middle line:84%
as having a moon or
an operational system

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.020 align:middle line:90%
based upon on the-- on the moon.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is this just on
the surface of the moon,

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.600 align:middle line:90%
or is it inside the moon?

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: I don't know.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: We have all these
telescopes around the planet,

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.970 align:middle line:84%
but we don't see anything
on the surface of the moon.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.660 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Well, we
do see something.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:53.080 align:middle line:84%
So even an amateur,
you know, astronomer

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:58.390 align:middle line:84%
with a kind of solid telescope,
if he watches the moon,

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:05.500 align:middle line:84%
he might see some, you know,
objects going from the surface

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.700 align:middle line:90%
into nowhere.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So there are also like, lots
and lots of videos out there

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.970 align:middle line:84%
that show objects appearing
and leaving the moon

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:17.660 align:middle line:90%
or going to the moon.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.330 align:middle line:90%
So it's the other way around.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:26.380 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of evidence
that some UAPs enter the moon

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:90%
and leave the moon.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, you already told me
that you also have, you know,

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:84%
seen things coming and going
from the moon, isn't it?

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Absolutely.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.330 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it myself, of
many amateur astronomers

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:44.350 align:middle line:84%
who send me videos and
they're very compelling.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Because they do
all the algorithms

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.900 align:middle line:84%
about how fast it's going, how
far away from the moon it is.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it
actually casts shadows

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.420 align:middle line:90%
on the moon, these craft.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I personally
have seen like,

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:04.270 align:middle line:84%
lightings and little UAP objects
through a telescope that enter

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.290 align:middle line:90%
and leave the moon.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think everyone,
you know, who

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:12.760 align:middle line:84%
has a kind of solid telescope
or goes on the internet

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.950 align:middle line:84%
and, you know,
types that in, they

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.560 align:middle line:84%
will find tons and
tons of evidence

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.910 align:middle line:90%
that this is happening.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And who
are these species?

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:90%


00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: I actually don't know.

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So I know that-- or at
least, the documentations

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.670 align:middle line:84%
say that human people
have bases on the moon.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Which might not
be too surprising,

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.240 align:middle line:84%
because the plans to
build a moon base,

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:84%
it is pretty much
well-documented.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.250 align:middle line:90%
It's in the files.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:48.290 align:middle line:84%
At least the United
States of America

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:55.280 align:middle line:84%
would have those plans
in the '50s, '60s.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and other nations as well.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.600 align:middle line:90%
They also went for the moon.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why do humans
need a base on the moon?

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: That's a hard
question to answer.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:11.270 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, the obvious reason
is the strategic advantage

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:12.890 align:middle line:90%
that the moon has.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:15.710 align:middle line:84%
It only shows one side,
so you have always like,

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:19.970 align:middle line:84%
a side that is not
pointing to the Earth,

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:23.180 align:middle line:84%
so you cannot see it, whatever
is happening on the so-called

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.650 align:middle line:90%
dark side of the moon.

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:28.050 align:middle line:84%
You potentially could
build something there.

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to move outside
of the gravitational field

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:37.610 align:middle line:84%
of Earth and travel far
inside of the solar system,

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:42.050 align:middle line:84%
then the moon would
be the perfect base

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:45.110 align:middle line:84%
and the perfect
opportunity to do so.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.900 align:middle line:84%
There also seemed--
you know, everyone

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.960 align:middle line:84%
agrees upon the
significance of the moon.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.260 align:middle line:84%
It's super important
for the Greys.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.030 align:middle line:90%
They make no deal about that.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.910 align:middle line:84%
They say it's the
key to ascension

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:90%
and it is the key to everything.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.380 align:middle line:84%
But also, Being 6 told
me that it's super

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:90%
important in the way it is.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:11.040 align:middle line:90%
So why do we need that?

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:15.800 align:middle line:84%
So again, the obvious reason,
the strategical advantage

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.680 align:middle line:84%
is the obvious
reason, but there also

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.560 align:middle line:84%
seems to be some
kind of force field,

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:27.110 align:middle line:84%
maybe some metaphysical reason
why it would be beneficial

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.870 align:middle line:84%
or be an advantage
if you have a moon--

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:33.612 align:middle line:84%
if you have operational
bases on the moon.

00:24:33.612 --> 00:24:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You say the moon
is the key to ascension.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.320 align:middle line:90%
The Greys had said this to you.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.230 align:middle line:84%
But yet, you also said it's
also suppressive, the moon.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:47.280 align:middle line:90%
So explain that.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So again, it's the
Greys that say that the moon is

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:54.320 align:middle line:90%
the key to ascension of Earth.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.380 align:middle line:84%
All species that
I've communicated to,

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.185 align:middle line:84%
they all agree upon
the fact that it's

00:25:00.185 --> 00:25:06.190 align:middle line:84%
of tremendous importance,
the role the moon plays.

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:08.590 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that
I'm not sure about

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:13.240 align:middle line:84%
is, do we need to
remove the effect

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.350 align:middle line:84%
or lower the effect that the
moon has upon Earth people

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:23.210 align:middle line:84%
in order to ascend, or is it
that we need the functionality

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:28.760 align:middle line:84%
that the moon offers in order
to become more evolved beings?

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:33.710 align:middle line:84%
If you imagine, again, the
perspective of Being 6,

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:84%
having this kind of
tube where energy

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:40.220 align:middle line:84%
flows from one
side to the other,

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and the moon as the
artificial pole and the sun

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:84%
as the metaphor for the
natural pole of source,

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:57.140 align:middle line:84%
so you might imagine this tube,
even by the way those two,

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:02.420 align:middle line:84%
you know, exit channels, in
some kind of way, how they look,

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:08.360 align:middle line:84%
if you see the sun as our
future and the way we will

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:13.070 align:middle line:84%
be in some time, be connected
with everything, be light,

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:20.300 align:middle line:84%
then you might also see the moon
as the dead body of everything.

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.200 align:middle line:84%
So you have the sun
as the life itself,

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:29.240 align:middle line:84%
but you also have the moon
as representative to death,

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:33.260 align:middle line:84%
at least if you look upon
this tube from the perspective

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.090 align:middle line:90%
of Being 6.

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And that, to them, at least,
is one of the unsolved problems

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:45.260 align:middle line:84%
that we have from
that point of view,

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:48.800 align:middle line:84%
from that level of
consciousness in this version

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.730 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:53.690 align:middle line:84%
We have this imbalance
between female and male

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:58.790 align:middle line:84%
that creates death, and
it also creates birth,

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.680 align:middle line:90%
and you have these cycles.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:05.270 align:middle line:84%
But do we want that, is
the question that Being 6

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:11.340 align:middle line:84%
is pretty much into at
that point of perception.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.600 align:middle line:84%
They try to figure
out and try to decide

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:20.700 align:middle line:84%
upon is death and birth and
death and birth as a cycling

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.300 align:middle line:84%
process something
that is necessary,

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.210 align:middle line:84%
or do we want to
evolve into a state

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:32.650 align:middle line:84%
where we all just be permanently
and make fluent decisions?

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.890 align:middle line:10%
And if we go back to
the Vedas, we also

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.220 align:middle line:10%
have Shiva, who is the
representation, you know,

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:42.150 align:middle line:10%
of death, but also
of gentle changes.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:44.190 align:middle line:90%
That means he's not dying.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:45.750 align:middle line:90%
He's not being born.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:47.670 align:middle line:90%
He's just there.

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:54.720 align:middle line:84%
He's the symbol of
smooth evolution.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And he also wears the moon in
his hair, so there we have it.

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What other evidence
do we have that the moon is

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.220 align:middle line:90%
artificial?

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So there have been a
lot of experiments on the moon,

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.370 align:middle line:84%
for example, by NASA, and that
is pretty well documented.

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:16.410 align:middle line:84%
For example, sound
experiments where

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:21.030 align:middle line:84%
they realized that
the moon is vibrating

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:23.380 align:middle line:90%
when something impacts it.

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So we also see those craters,
which means there are--

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.360 align:middle line:90%
whatever hit the moon.

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:35.550 align:middle line:84%
we don't know, maybe
something hit it,

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.520 align:middle line:84%
maybe something
artificial hit it.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm hinting that--

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.792 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Maybe it's just art.

00:28:41.792 --> 00:28:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Maybe it's art.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:43.620 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.750 align:middle line:84%
But when you look
upon the craters,

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:51.550 align:middle line:84%
they are very wide in the width,
but they're not very deep.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So whatever had an impact
there had enough force

00:28:55.740 --> 00:29:01.170 align:middle line:84%
to create these huge craters,
but it's still very flat.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:04.350 align:middle line:90%
So that is another indicator.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:08.430 align:middle line:84%
If the moon was a solid,
natural structure,

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:16.650 align:middle line:84%
then you had very deep craters,
maybe like in the United States

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:84%
where you have those, Arizona
or something, there's craters.

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So the depth of all
these craters are basically

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:27.740 align:middle line:84%
the same depth,
they're just wider?

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Yeah.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:34.180 align:middle line:84%
So it seems as if we have
a artificial structure that

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:39.280 align:middle line:84%
is even hollow or something
underneath some kind of dust,

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:43.000 align:middle line:84%
moon dust or something
that sticks to the moon.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And whatever hits the
moon doesn't penetrate

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:49.330 align:middle line:90%
the structure of the moon.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And the
topography of, you know,

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:54.610 align:middle line:84%
the light side of the moon
compared to the dark side

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:56.330 align:middle line:84%
of the moon is
completely different.

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:57.160 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.285 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: It seems different.

00:29:58.285 --> 00:29:59.650 align:middle line:90%
I have no reason.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:01.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why that is.

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: There are people that
suggest we actually have not

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:05.560 align:middle line:90%
been to the moon.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.710 align:middle line:90%
Have we?

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Interesting question.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So the documents
suggest that there

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:20.080 align:middle line:84%
is activity, human activity
on the moon right now.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So at some point or another,
we, or at least human people,

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:29.660 align:middle line:84%
must have been to the moon
because they are there.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:35.350 align:middle line:84%
The documents suggest that they
are operating there right now.

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:38.420 align:middle line:90%
If everything we have seen--

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:42.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm thinking that
you're referring to the theory

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:48.130 align:middle line:84%
that the moon landing was
fake, you know, video.

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Yeah.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Something.

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:51.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:52.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.960 align:middle line:84%
It might be, because
a lot of things

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.920 align:middle line:90%
are strange or even edited.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And we also have
these astronauts

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:10.720 align:middle line:84%
that at least say or suggest
that some presence was there

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.640 align:middle line:90%
when they went there.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Lots and lots of
footage that we have

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:20.770 align:middle line:84%
coming from NASA or
different other programs,

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.570 align:middle line:90%
they seem to be edited.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:26.740 align:middle line:84%
So something's going
on, that's for sure.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:31.660 align:middle line:84%
But if the story that human
people went to the moon

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:35.800 align:middle line:84%
with the rocket and stuff,
if that is staged or not,

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And what about
the scientists who say we

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:43.090 align:middle line:84%
can't even travel there
because of the Van Allen belt,

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:45.680 align:middle line:90%
this energy field?

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: So I'm pretty sure that,
because I have seen operating

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:56.810 align:middle line:84%
crafts that can hover
and go outside of Earth,

00:31:56.810 --> 00:32:00.320 align:middle line:84%
it's technically absolutely
possible to go to the moon.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:06.450 align:middle line:84%
If things are 100% true the
way it's been presented,

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And how are we
allowed to go to the moon?

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:15.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, the extraterrestrials,
obviously, they

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.000 align:middle line:90%
put this in place.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.010 align:middle line:90%
How did we get permission?

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Is there an alliance
between Earth

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and the moon or
different countries

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:27.950 align:middle line:84%
and the presence of these
extraterrestrials on the moon?

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>> TIM: Good question.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So I think because
the significance

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.510 align:middle line:84%
of the moon, the
importance is so high,

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and this is the one thing
everyone agrees upon,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:84%
the space on moon
is limited as well.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:51.710 align:middle line:84%
So I can only suggest that a
lot of conflict might arise from

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that in order to figure out who
has a right to be on the moon

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.370 align:middle line:90%
and who hasn't.

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Again, we have this kind
of legislative structure

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:06.500 align:middle line:84%
in the universe where we
have local laws, where

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:10.820 align:middle line:84%
we have genetic and
temporal laws, and then

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:16.080 align:middle line:84%
some ultimate artificial law
as a super revision instance.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that
every species that has,

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:25.810 align:middle line:84%
you know, some material on
Earth would have a right to be

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:27.730 align:middle line:90%
on the moon in the first place.

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
there are lot of--

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:33.010 align:middle line:90%
lots and lots of species here.

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Again, the second
thing is genetic law,

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:40.150 align:middle line:84%
which means whoever
has the oldest

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:44.000 align:middle line:84%
generics on the planet would
have the right to be there.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And the third one is,
who's the species that

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:48.550 align:middle line:90%
is on this planet the longest?

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:52.030 align:middle line:84%
If it's true what the
non-terrestrials are saying,

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:56.120 align:middle line:84%
humans were not the first
inhabitants of this planet.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:00.070 align:middle line:84%
There are other, for
example, dinosaur species

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:05.890 align:middle line:84%
that have evolved, some species
that have evolved from insects.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:10.960 align:middle line:84%
They would have the
first right by that kind

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.880 align:middle line:90%
of model of legislation.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.870 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, humans are here
for a pretty long time,

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:20.502 align:middle line:84%
so they definitely have a right
to be on the moon as well.

00:34:20.502 --> 00:34:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: If there's one thing
that you would like to know,

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Tim, about the moon that someone
can answer, what would that be?

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: I'm super curious to
understand why the Greys are

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:35.860 align:middle line:84%
saying that the moon is
the key to ascension.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:40.989 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, if anybody in the
audience has some kind of idea,

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:44.830 align:middle line:84%
just leave it as a
comment and maybe

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:47.739 align:middle line:90%
we can find some truth to that.

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Fantastic.

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much,
Tim, for being on the show.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: Thank you
very much, Emery.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.305 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:34:59.305 --> 00:35:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Next, on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How do some
species use psionics?

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: There are some species
that are more capable of using

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.490 align:middle line:84%
psionics, which means the
ability to alter your reality

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:13.480 align:middle line:90%
by thought.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:16.002 align:middle line:84%
Humans have a great
potential in doing that.

00:35:16.002 --> 00:35:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: So what you're saying
reminds me of the Maharishi

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:19.260 align:middle line:90%
effect.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>> TIM: The more parts come
together and use their creative

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:28.240 align:middle line:84%
powers to move reality
into one or another spot,

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.840 align:middle line:84%
the easier it is to
create something.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:36.040 align:middle line:84%
That is why when you have a
group of people, especially

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.680 align:middle line:84%
people that connect
to each other,

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:43.330 align:middle line:84%
that can be used in order
to manifest and to connect

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:45.760 align:middle line:90%
to the universe very quickly.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.100 align:middle line:90%
Reality can be altered.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.530 align:middle line:90%
You're not a victim of yourself.

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:54.100 align:middle line:84%
You are the creator, as
well as everyone else.
