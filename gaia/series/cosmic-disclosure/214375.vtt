>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.420 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty, a
retired Special Agent who

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.300 align:middle line:10%
served in the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.560 align:middle line:10%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.150 align:middle line:10%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Today we are discussing
Operation Golden Deep.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.620 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So Richard,
Operation Golden Deep

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:90%
sounds so mysterious.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.820 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell us about that?

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.400 align:middle line:10%
>> DOTY: Well, the United
States Navy over the years,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.550 align:middle line:10%
especially in the '60s
and '70s, tracked USOs,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.330 align:middle line:10%
underwater submersibles,
and some of them were from--

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.160 align:middle line:10%
they started as refers, and
then they landed in the water

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.440 align:middle line:10%
and it became USOs.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And there were literally
hundreds of cases that occurred

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:90%
in the '60s and '70s.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So the United States Navy's
Office of Naval Intelligence

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.120 align:middle line:84%
decided to try to catch
one of these things.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's capture it to see
what these things are.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And so they decided to do it in
areas where most of these things

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:25.910 align:middle line:90%
were spotted.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:33.550 align:middle line:10%
And surprisingly, most of these
sightings of from UFO to a USO

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.750 align:middle line:10%
were being done in
the Indian Ocean,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.060 align:middle line:10%
the southern part
of the Indian Ocean,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.650 align:middle line:10%
where there's very little
ship traffic either just

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.480 align:middle line:10%
above or below of Australia.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So they put some
submarines out there,

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.990 align:middle line:84%
and we got cooperation
from the Royal Australian

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Navy and the United
Kingdom's Navy,

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.610 align:middle line:90%
and we tried to capture it.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.080 align:middle line:84%
So we frequented the
area with submarines.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.750 align:middle line:10%
And when we spotted one, and we
did, it came in from Antarctica.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.965 align:middle line:10%
Seems like most of them
came in from Antarctica.

00:02:10.965 --> 00:02:11.840 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Interesting.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.310 align:middle line:10%
>> DOTY: And then they went into
the water in the Southern Indian

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.070 align:middle line:10%
Ocean, and then our submarines
would then try to track it.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.620 align:middle line:84%
But the problem we had was
keeping up with these USOs.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Once they're in the water,
they weren't slowing down.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.590 align:middle line:84%
They had some
technology that allowed

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.340 align:middle line:84%
them to travel through the
water at the same speed

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.930 align:middle line:84%
that they were doing in
air in the atmosphere.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And we couldn't figure
that out at first.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And so the United
States Navy then

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:84%
developed this system called
deep water sonar tracking.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And the deep water
sonar tracking

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.760 align:middle line:84%
was a highly sophisticated
method of tracking things deep

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.700 align:middle line:90%
under the ocean.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, normally,
the old sonar system

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.790 align:middle line:84%
could only track them
a few thousand feet.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.470 align:middle line:84%
This new DWST program
could track them thousands

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.800 align:middle line:90%
of feet under the water.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.280 align:middle line:84%
So they could
follow these things

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.040 align:middle line:84%
and see where they were
going, at least knowing

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.550 align:middle line:84%
which direction they were going
and the depth they were going.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.980 align:middle line:84%
It didn't help us because
we didn't have anything

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.540 align:middle line:90%
that could go down that deep.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Submarines could go
maybe 3,000, 3,500 feet.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:84%
We had underwater
submersibles that

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.240 align:middle line:84%
could go a little
bit deeper than that.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.190 align:middle line:84%
But this is in
the '60s and '70s.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.870 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't have anything
they could deeper than that.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:43.580 align:middle line:84%
So in the 1980s, with the deep
water sonar tracking system,

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:84%
we isolated where the majority
of these USOs were going.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.320 align:middle line:10%
And they were going in an area
that was about 1,000 miles

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.040 align:middle line:10%
southwest of Perth,
Australia, between Perth,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.820 align:middle line:10%
Australia and the
Kerguelen Islands.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And we did a program, a show
on the Kerguelen Islands.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And so we put some
submarines in that area,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.680 align:middle line:90%
waiting for one to come in.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:90%
And we did.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:90%
We tracked it.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.980 align:middle line:90%
We tracked one that came in.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, before we
get too deep into that,

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.390 align:middle line:84%
let the viewers know,
how did the US Navy first

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.240 align:middle line:84%
come about noticing these
USOs in the Indian Ocean?

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: The United States Navy
used that area of the Indian

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Ocean for training and testing
because there's virtually no

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.720 align:middle line:90%
ship traffic in that area.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And so they could
operate out there,

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.230 align:middle line:84%
free from anybody else's eyes or
any other anybody else's Navies.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.980 align:middle line:90%
So they were down there.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.640 align:middle line:90%
And then they saw this one.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.530 align:middle line:84%
They tracked it from
Antarctica, a UFO.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.750 align:middle line:84%
It came into the water
and now became a USO.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Now we were tracking it.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:84%
The submarine was going as
deep as it could to track it,

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.000 align:middle line:90%
but we lost it.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.340 align:middle line:90%
That was one that just got away.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So a few months later,
we did the same thing.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Only this time we had more
submarines down there.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:84%
The first time we
only had a couple.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.880 align:middle line:84%
This time we had more with
assistance of surface ships

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.150 align:middle line:84%
from the Austrian Navy,
and we got one finally.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:84%
We got it going into the
water, and we had it trapped,

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.947 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:05:29.947 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: You said trapped.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.572 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how did they trap
this intelligent vehicle?

00:05:33.572 --> 00:05:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, they trapped
it with other submarines.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:90%
We had submarines around it.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So we were hoping that we
could isolate it and keep it

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.752 align:middle line:90%
within a depth that we could go.

00:05:44.752 --> 00:05:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, what was that
objective then to surround it?

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: To try to capture it.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.270 align:middle line:84%
They had some surface ships
with netting and other things

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.703 align:middle line:84%
that they thought they could
throw in and capture it.

00:05:55.703 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How did that
work out for them?

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: It didn't work out very
well because this thing went

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.590 align:middle line:84%
deeper, and deeper, and deeper,
and we weren't able to track it

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:06.400 align:middle line:90%
and keep it.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.760 align:middle line:90%
But we kept doing this.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.020 align:middle line:84%
We kept over, and over, and
over trying to capture it.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we were able
to actually isolate one.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.612 align:middle line:84%
And that's where all this
famous incident happened.

00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now explain
to the viewers

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.420 align:middle line:84%
how our technology from
1985, tracking these USOs,

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.765 align:middle line:84%
is compared to today's
tracking of the USOs.

00:06:28.765 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, our tracking
systems today are so far

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.780 align:middle line:90%
advanced.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.920 align:middle line:84%
We have submarines
that can go deeper.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.660 align:middle line:84%
We have sonar systems that can
map the bottom of the ocean

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.780 align:middle line:90%
floor, 39,000 feet.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.290 align:middle line:84%
We have laser systems
that can ping a submarine.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.910 align:middle line:84%
If we were chasing, say, a
Soviet or a Russian submarine,

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:57.290 align:middle line:84%
we could shoot something at
that submarine that targets it,

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.190 align:middle line:90%
lights it up, so to speak.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And then we could just lay back
and watch wherever it went.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And so we didn't have
that back in those days.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.053 align:middle line:84%
So this particular
incident happened in 1985.

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:84%
A UFO went into the
ocean, became a USO.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.060 align:middle line:84%
There was one of our
submarines that was

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:90%
close proximity to this USO.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.710 align:middle line:84%
The submarine
started at the USO,

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and the USO started
at the US submarine.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:31.190 align:middle line:84%
At this point, the commander of
the submarine decided to fire

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.510 align:middle line:90%
a non-nuclear torpedo at the--

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Wouldn't that be
an act of war and violence

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.480 align:middle line:84%
amongst this,
whoever this race is?

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: True.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.980 align:middle line:84%
It certainly would be
an act of aggression

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.960 align:middle line:90%
against this other craft.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't know whose
craft it was, remember?

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But the commander
wasn't concerned with that act

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.555 align:middle line:90%
since he fired first?

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:54.472 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Admiral Carpenter
is telling me this,

00:07:54.472 --> 00:07:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and he knew who
the commander was.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And he said that the
commander of that submarine

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.280 align:middle line:90%
felt threatened.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.580 align:middle line:84%
He felt that his submarine
was being threatened,

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.320 align:middle line:90%
and he had to act accordingly.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know what kind of
rules of engagement they had.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.700 align:middle line:84%
But you protect your submarine
or your ship at all costs.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Of course.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And so he fired the
non-nuclear torpedo at the USO

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.270 align:middle line:90%
and hit it.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And it stunned--
stayed in the water,

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and it was under water
about 2,600 feet.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And what happened next, the
USO fired a beam of light

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:37.840 align:middle line:84%
at the submarine,
at our submarine.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And now this is where the story
gets extremely interesting.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: It hits the submarine.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.480 align:middle line:84%
The personnel, the Navy,
I think it was said

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.170 align:middle line:84%
it was 68 sailors on
board the submarine.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Every one of those
sailors were stunned.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.220 align:middle line:84%
The 11 personnel that were
in the nuclear reactor

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.220 align:middle line:84%
room or the area where
the nuclear reactor was,

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.630 align:middle line:90%
blacked out.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:90%
The nuclear reactor shut down.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Now, he explained,
Admiral Carpenter was

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.440 align:middle line:90%
a submarine commander, 21 years.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.180 align:middle line:90%
He said that can't happen.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.390 align:middle line:84%
The reactor has to go through
phase shutdown systems.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And it takes, he said,
anywhere between 45 minutes

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.183 align:middle line:84%
to an hour to shut
down because you

00:09:24.183 --> 00:09:26.600 align:middle line:84%
have to take the fuel rods out
and all these other things.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Cool down.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: But it immediately
shut the reactor off,

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:36.650 align:middle line:84%
which in a way endangered the
entire crew and especially

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:43.430 align:middle line:84%
the personnel, the 11 sailors
inside the nuclear reactor area.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Now those 11 sailors, two
of them didn't black out.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Two of them started
hearing voices.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And the voices
were telling them,

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.580 align:middle line:90%
we're not here to harm you.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.240 align:middle line:90%
We're not here to harm you.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Now these two were
senior technicians.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.180 align:middle line:90%
Two of them were ensigns.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Ensigns, yeah.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And two of
them were lieutenants,

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.000 align:middle line:90%
which were like captains in--

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:09.950 align:middle line:90%
They're all 3s.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.420 align:middle line:90%
02s and 03s, I believe.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So do you believe
the alien race chose

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.877 align:middle line:84%
those two in that area
to receive this message?

00:10:17.877 --> 00:10:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.252 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Does that makes sense?

00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: That made sense because
these technicians were hearing

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.440 align:middle line:84%
the voices saying, we're
not here to harm you.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:90%
Don't shoot back at us.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.800 align:middle line:84%
So all they could do
was try to figure out

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.120 align:middle line:90%
how to restart the reactor.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.750 align:middle line:84%
But between 5 and 7
minutes later, the reactor

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.550 align:middle line:84%
started on its
own, which again--

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Impossible.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.723 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: It's almost impossible.

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:41.575 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that.

00:10:41.575 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:90%
How can they do that?

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.410 align:middle line:90%
And we can't do that.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And they did it with
a beam of light.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.592 align:middle line:84%
But these two technicians,
at that point, of course,

00:10:48.592 --> 00:10:50.300 align:middle line:84%
they had to stay in
there because they're

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.780 align:middle line:90%
responsible for this reactor.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.810 align:middle line:84%
So they couldn't go
communicate any of this

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.295 align:middle line:90%
to the captain of the ship.

00:10:55.295 --> 00:10:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It must have been
complete chaos in there.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.587 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Well, it was chaos.

00:10:58.587 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle line:84%
The whole submarine and the
commander, the captain, I mean,

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.450 align:middle line:84%
my god, what just
happened to our submarine?

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.310 align:middle line:84%
After five or seven minutes,
everybody else came too.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Now what the captain then
said was load torpedo

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.100 align:middle line:84%
number two because
these people just

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.053 align:middle line:84%
try to sink us or
try to destroy us.

00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's what
he's thinking, yes.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, these two
technicians figured, no,

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.880 align:middle line:90%
Captain, you can't do this.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is where they try to
communicate with the bridge,

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.930 align:middle line:90%
saying, sir, don't do this.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Hold off,
hold off, hold off.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.630 align:middle line:84%
So they eventually got on
whatever communication system

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.440 align:middle line:90%
and told the bridge, hold off.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.490 align:middle line:90%
Do not fire a torpedo.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.750 align:middle line:90%
Do not fire a torpedo.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, the captain
figured then, there

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
must be something wrong
why we can't fire torpedo.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:84%
One of the technicians, they
both are communicating back.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Did you hear this voice?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.042 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I heard this voice.

00:11:51.042 --> 00:11:52.890 align:middle line:90%
He went up to the bridge.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And he tells the
commander what happened.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.860 align:middle line:84%
He said, we're hearing
voices telling us

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.190 align:middle line:90%
they're not here to harm us.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.235 align:middle line:84%
Do not fire another
torpedo at us.

00:12:05.235 --> 00:12:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Of course, now,
how do you tell--

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: How does a
lieutenant tell a captain,

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:15.350 align:middle line:90%
an 03 tell an 06--

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: No way.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: --don't do
this, and try to explain,

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.017 align:middle line:90%
I hear voices in my head.

00:12:20.017 --> 00:12:21.460 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know what?

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.895 align:middle line:84%
That captain started
thinking and realizing he

00:12:24.895 --> 00:12:26.020 align:middle line:90%
doesn't know what happened.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And OK, we're not going
to shoot back right now.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, a UK submarine is
in the area coming in.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Now they know that the
US submarine is disabled.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.252 align:middle line:90%
The UK submarine comes in--

00:12:41.252 --> 00:12:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Coming in hot.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: --and bumps the USO.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, my goodness.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: The USO starts
falling, and it fell down to--

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.200 align:middle line:90%
the floor was 6,000 there.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.870 align:middle line:84%
They didn't shoot at
it, but they bumped it.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.120 align:middle line:84%
They had some damage,
but they bumped it,

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and it fell down to the
bottom of the ocean.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I just-- that
expensive submarine,

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.650 align:middle line:84%
and they just they could
have done other things.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.480 align:middle line:84%
What was the
reasoning to bump it?

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.080 align:middle line:84%
They knew that could
actually kill them, possibly.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, the British
commander of the submarine

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.320 align:middle line:90%
decided that he didn't want--

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.550 align:middle line:84%
he was using the
less lethal force

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:26.530 align:middle line:84%
he thought he could do to
keep this object, this USO,

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.170 align:middle line:84%
to shoot at an
American submarine.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.460 align:middle line:90%
So he came in and bumped it.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: All right.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And he did exactly
right because he was able

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.030 align:middle line:84%
to knock this thing
down to 6,000 feet.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So the USO got bumped.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.980 align:middle line:90%
It sank down to 6,000 feet.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.050 align:middle line:90%
What happened next, Rick?

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: OK.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:50.370 align:middle line:84%
The US submarine
regained control.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:51.880 align:middle line:90%
The reactor started.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.650 align:middle line:84%
They realized that it was no
scram, meaning that there's

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:57.160 align:middle line:90%
nothing wrong with the reactor.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.930 align:middle line:84%
They were going
through safety systems.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.430 align:middle line:90%
So now he's back.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.305 align:middle line:84%
He's back in the
fight, so to speak.

00:14:02.305 --> 00:14:03.105 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:14:03.105 --> 00:14:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: So what
do they do next?

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.680 align:middle line:84%
They go down as deep
as they can go down.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.320 align:middle line:84%
They can't go down 6,000 feet,
but they go down as deep as they

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.610 align:middle line:90%
can go down.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And now, there's two more
US submarines that join in.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of around
this area, the underwater,

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.150 align:middle line:84%
and they both go down
to about 4,000 feet.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.310 align:middle line:90%
The two of them go down 4,000.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.600 align:middle line:84%
The British submarine could
only go down to 2,900 feet.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And there were two
other US submarines.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure exactly
what depth they were at.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Four total around
the surrounding area.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Six.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.250 align:middle line:90%
Five, excuse me.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.160 align:middle line:90%
One British and four American.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Got it.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And so the Americans
go down, and they stay,

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:48.850 align:middle line:84%
and with their deep water
sonar tracking system,

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:50.080 align:middle line:90%
they're monitoring that.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.860 align:middle line:84%
They're pinging that thing
with sonar waves to figure out,

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.250 align:middle line:90%
OK, what's that going to do?

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:00.450 align:middle line:84%
That USO has to make the
first move because they

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:01.510 align:middle line:90%
can't go down there.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So this was for hours,
and hours, and hours.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.785 align:middle line:90%
Actually days.

00:15:05.785 --> 00:15:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Babysitting.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And eventually, this
thing, the USO comes back up.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:90%
And they watch it.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Now at this point, all the
submarines were on the surface.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:84%
The USO comes right
up in between them.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the surface ships,
the US Navy surface ship,

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.300 align:middle line:84%
tried to communicate
with the USO.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:90%
Now it's on the surface.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.690 align:middle line:84%
They were using flashing
lights, typically what

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:31.380 align:middle line:84%
the Navy would use when they
were communicating from one ship

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.260 align:middle line:90%
to another ship.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Morse code with the lights.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.218 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Plus they
were using a scanning,

00:15:35.218 --> 00:15:38.160 align:middle line:84%
a hailing typical radio
frequencies to try

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.600 align:middle line:90%
to communicate.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Hey, guys, we're here.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:41.740 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:42.823 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to harm you.

00:15:42.823 --> 00:15:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Can you communicate with us?

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.132 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing this for
literally hours and hours.

00:15:48.132 --> 00:15:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was the
size of this thing?

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.010 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
all these warships.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.843 align:middle line:84%
You got the large
submarines out there.

00:15:52.843 --> 00:15:54.010 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at here?

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: It's about a
50-foot in diameter.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: In diameter?

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Is it this shape?

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:90%
Is it round?

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: It's this shape.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, more oval, I think.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So that's not very big.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.180 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: More oval.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.030 align:middle line:90%
Not really big.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.297 align:middle line:90%
But it had no markings on it.

00:16:06.297 --> 00:16:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Can't see inside of it.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Can't see inside of it.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:14.400 align:middle line:84%
It did have something
like a water spout.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.190 align:middle line:90%
It was shooting up water.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.220 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't sure if it was
water was something else, maybe

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.440 align:middle line:84%
cooling it, or
they weren't sure.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.260 align:middle line:84%
So their message is
going back and forth

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:30.840 align:middle line:84%
to pack the Pacific fleet
in Hawaii at Pearl Harbor.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.010 align:middle line:90%
What do we do now?

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And the message comes back
is capture it at all cost.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:38.710 align:middle line:90%
Capture it.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.255 align:middle line:90%
Now, the plan, which--

00:16:41.255 --> 00:16:43.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: These are how protocols
are written, by the way.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.505 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: These are how
protocols are written.

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And so the plan was to
board it, try to board it

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:50.940 align:middle line:90%
and get inside of it.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:56.200 align:middle line:84%
But there were no
boarding parties.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:01.110 align:middle line:84%
There were some Navy people,
Navy sailors that were trained.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:05.280 align:middle line:84%
They had handguns on
board the submarines.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.859 align:middle line:84%
And I think they figured
they had about 15 trained

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.460 align:middle line:90%
sailors that could do it.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.810 align:middle line:84%
The Australians, one of the
Australian surface ships

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:18.720 align:middle line:84%
had Australian army personnel
on board like an SAS.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.740 align:middle line:90%
And so they said, we'll do it.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.960 align:middle line:84%
We'll put a craft in the water,
and we'll try to roll up to it

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.310 align:middle line:90%
or move up to it.

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:28.290 align:middle line:90%
But how do they get in it?

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
so many questions.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.690 align:middle line:90%
So they did.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.710 align:middle line:84%
They launched a boat
from the Australian ship.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:39.550 align:middle line:84%
The boat went up to the
USO in close proximity.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:40.950 align:middle line:90%
And now what?

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:41.750 align:middle line:90%
How do you--

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: This is comical, yeah.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Yeah, exactly.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.100 align:middle line:90%
It is comical.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.118 align:middle line:90%
When the story--

00:17:45.118 --> 00:17:47.160 align:middle line:84%
Admiral Carpenter telling
me this, and I thought,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.413 align:middle line:90%
Keystone Cops, guys.

00:17:48.413 --> 00:17:50.080 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to
get inside of that?

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.955 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have any
way of getting in there.

00:17:51.955 --> 00:17:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why do you believe
the USO was just sitting there?

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.240 align:middle line:84%
We have troops
coming up in boats,

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.250 align:middle line:84%
probably knocking
on the hull there.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.490 align:middle line:90%
Why was it sitting there?

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: We thought
it was disabled.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.010 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't flying away.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.570 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't going down--

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It could
have done whatever.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.255 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: --under the water.

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:11.100 align:middle line:84%
So we thought, well,
it has to be disabled.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And because it had been there
for hours, and hours, and hours.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:18.610 align:middle line:84%
So we figured, well, let's try
to get in it and capture it,

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:22.860 align:middle line:84%
at least that's what Pacific
headquarters told them to do.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:26.670 align:middle line:84%
So the Australian
Special Forces people

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.770 align:middle line:84%
actually got out and
was climbing on it

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.990 align:middle line:84%
and trying to get
them to open up,

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:35.800 align:middle line:84%
moving their hands around what
they thought was a portal.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.970 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened.

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And so they got back in the
boat, the Special Forces

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:40.850 align:middle line:90%
personnel.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, they started
shooting water spurts.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.760 align:middle line:84%
The USO was shooting water
spurts onto the boat,

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:55.360 align:middle line:84%
like trying to sink the Navy,
the Special Forces boat, which

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.050 align:middle line:90%
then got out of there.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And then at this point, the USO
shot directly up in the air,

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:06.700 align:middle line:84%
almost as if it was traveling
at the speed of light.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.665 align:middle line:90%
And now--

00:19:07.665 --> 00:19:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: At least
they warned it.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Looked like they were
warning them to get back.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Like here, they're spraying
them with water hoses

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.640 align:middle line:90%
like we do the pirates.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:90%
And it was gone.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:16.730 align:middle line:90%
And what happened?

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Nothing.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:18.410 align:middle line:90%
It left.

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:21.370 align:middle line:84%
So now, we think
about the 11 sailors

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:24.610 align:middle line:84%
that are in the submarine that
was hit with a beam of light.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:27.100 align:middle line:84%
The two that heard
voices, they were

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.750 align:middle line:84%
transported to another
ship, a surface ship,

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:34.810 align:middle line:84%
and sent to Pearl Harbor to be
medically examined because they

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:38.380 align:middle line:84%
thought, number one, they had
radiation sickness or something

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:43.040 align:middle line:84%
happened to them because they
were telling these stories.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.470 align:middle line:84%
They're having horrible
dreams about planets,

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:51.160 align:middle line:84%
living on a planet,
being in these cages

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.980 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:58.880 align:middle line:84%
These two technicians were still
hearing voices in their heads.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So the Navy psychiatrists
are trying to examine them,

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.930 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure
out what happened,

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:08.960 align:middle line:84%
why are they having
these visions.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And the end of the story is
that these 11 sailors that

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.290 align:middle line:84%
suffered while this
beam of light hit,

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:84%
not just the submarine
but the reactor,

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:27.590 align:middle line:84%
are in some sort of
a psychological state

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:31.160 align:middle line:84%
that nobody can seem
to understand what.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Two of the sailors were
discharged, medically

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.240 align:middle line:84%
discharged, because
they were going

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.570 align:middle line:84%
through these
psychological traumas.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:84%
They were being treated
at the VA hospital

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.470 align:middle line:90%
for a long period of time.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:47.700 align:middle line:90%
But the Navy followed them.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.890 align:middle line:84%
The two technicians or the
officers, the nuclear reactor

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:56.180 align:middle line:84%
officers, they weren't
as badly affected

00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:00.390 align:middle line:84%
by the psychological trauma, but
they still were hearing voices.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And these voices were trying to
explain to them what happened.

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:09.130 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't understanding
who was talking to them.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Until years later, Admiral
Carpenter said years later,

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:17.000 align:middle line:84%
they realized that
these extraterrestrials

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.610 align:middle line:84%
got in their head, and were
communicating with them,

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.190 align:middle line:84%
and wanted them
to understand what

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:84%
these extraterrestrials
were doing,

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:25.410 align:middle line:90%
that they weren't harming.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing
that one of these,

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:34.610 align:middle line:84%
at this time, this guy, a
captain or the lieutenant,

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:84%
was a lieutenant commander,
he said in an interview

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:50.770 align:middle line:84%
with a Navy personnel, these
extraterrestrials live on Earth.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:51.813 align:middle line:90%
They're from this planet.

00:21:51.813 --> 00:21:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's right.

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: They live
on the ocean floor.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.470 align:middle line:84%
They migrated from
the stars, and this

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:03.910 align:middle line:84%
is their words, the
stars to our planet,

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:07.060 align:middle line:84%
and they've lived here
for thousands of years.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Now that is an
overwhelming statement

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.030 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand
that these things were

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:18.190 align:middle line:84%
able to fly into the
Earth's orbit or into space,

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.660 align:middle line:84%
but they always come back
to where their home is,

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:24.550 align:middle line:84%
which is the bottom of the
ocean, thousands of feet below.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:28.115 align:middle line:84%
And if you remember one
of the other episodes--

00:22:28.115 --> 00:22:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's what
I was thinking of.

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Admiral Carpenter said,
we saw lights at the bottom

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:90%
of the ocean.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: All lit up like a city.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:37.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: So these things
were from this planet.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Were there
any other USO incidents

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:47.810 align:middle line:84%
that were similar to Operation
Golden Deep that you can recall?

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: There is.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.020 align:middle line:90%
There's one other.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.400 align:middle line:84%
One that happened-- It didn't
happen in the Indian Ocean.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.560 align:middle line:84%
It happened up near Alaska,
off the Alaskan Peninsula,

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.770 align:middle line:90%
the Aleutian Islands.

00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:58.853 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Aleutian Islands.

00:22:58.853 --> 00:23:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Where they actually
were able to chase a USO up onto

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.900 align:middle line:90%
a shore.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.990 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't know
what to do with it,

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and there wasn't enough ships or
military personnel in that area

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:90%
to respond.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:15.428 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, the craft
took off, and they

00:23:15.428 --> 00:23:16.470 align:middle line:90%
weren't able to catch it.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:21.210 align:middle line:84%
But the object there, just
like in the Indian Ocean,

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:25.910 align:middle line:84%
was to capture it, and
they weren't able to do it.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how have they
captured a USO since then?

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: There's one story
that's still highly classified

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:37.440 align:middle line:84%
that didn't happen very long
ago, probably 15 or 20 years.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.350 align:middle line:84%
These stories I'm telling you
now happening 40 years ago.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.790 align:middle line:84%
But there was one incident
that happened maybe

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.890 align:middle line:84%
15 or 20 years ago, where
we actually captured one,

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:48.420 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
the whole story.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, you said earlier
that there were craft that

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.130 align:middle line:90%
were coming from Antarctica.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Now did you mean like the space
above Antarctica, the land

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:59.730 align:middle line:90%
or the ocean under Antarctica?

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, based on a
lot of other information

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:07.040 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence, some of these
UFOs were being launched from

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:13.370 align:middle line:84%
the surface of Antarctica, and
into the sky and then flying

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.920 align:middle line:84%
into the Indian Ocean,
around the Indian Ocean.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.970 align:middle line:84%
What they actually were
doing on Antarctica,

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.783 align:middle line:84%
maybe there's another base
under the ice in Antarctica,

00:24:23.783 --> 00:24:24.700 align:middle line:90%
which we talked about.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: We talked about this.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Or there's some other
reason that they fly from there

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.150 align:middle line:90%
to under the ocean.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:33.585 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That makes sense.

00:24:33.585 --> 00:24:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Rick, these craft that you're
talking about in Antarctica,

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:40.050 align:middle line:84%
the bottom of the sea,
what type of materials

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.480 align:middle line:84%
are they utilizing
to repair their craft

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.755 align:middle line:90%
or to run their craft?

00:24:43.755 --> 00:24:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Where are they
getting them from?

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I bet you they're
getting them from the bottom

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:47.890 align:middle line:90%
of the ocean.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:52.080 align:middle line:84%
There's scientists out there
that tell us there's minerals

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.800 align:middle line:84%
down there at the
bottom of the ocean,

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:58.390 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the Mariana Trench,
39,000 feet, or in this area,

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:00.460 align:middle line:90%
which is about 20,000 feet.

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:04.110 align:middle line:84%
There's minerals down there
that we probably haven't even

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.930 align:middle line:90%
mined yet.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:05.730 align:middle line:90%
We don't even know.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And these things,
if they've been here,

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.760 align:middle line:84%
this civilization's been
here for thousands of years.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.220 align:middle line:84%
They're already
mining these areas,

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.510 align:middle line:84%
picking up these minerals,
and manufacturing the crafts

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.620 align:middle line:84%
probably down in the
bottom of the ocean floor.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:25.440 align:middle line:84%
If they've adjusted themselves
to living down there.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Now you can understand, the
pressure down there at 20,000

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.550 align:middle line:90%
feet is enormous.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:34.960 align:middle line:84%
It would buckle steel, or
metal, or even titanium.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:40.230 align:middle line:84%
So they have adjusted their
environment or their bodies

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:41.440 align:middle line:90%
to living down there.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.300 align:middle line:84%
They probably are mining and
having industries down there

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.040 align:middle line:90%
that create these crafts.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think
there's a correlation

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:84%
with these extraterrestrials
compared to the ones

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:54.450 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about
in prior episodes.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.640 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned these
dome cities and

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.470 align:middle line:84%
these other
extraterrestrial bases

00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:59.920 align:middle line:90%
down at the bottom of the ocean.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I think it's
just one civilization.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:03.900 align:middle line:84%
I think it came to
Earth thousands of years

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:08.910 align:middle line:84%
ago from some other planet, and
they decided that they like it

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:10.590 align:middle line:90%
here for some reason.

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And they can adjust to the
bottom of our ocean, which

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:14.970 align:middle line:90%
we can't do.

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.990 align:middle line:84%
There's fish that
can live down there,

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:18.970 align:middle line:84%
but we could never
live down there.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, they have
their own density field

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:23.532 align:middle line:84%
that they're creating I'm sure,
that they can live in that.

00:26:23.532 --> 00:26:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: That's exactly
what Admiral Carpenter says.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.970 align:middle line:84%
If we were able to
create certain types

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.580 align:middle line:84%
of positive pressure
environments

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.137 align:middle line:84%
or fields or density fields,
we could live down there.

00:26:35.137 --> 00:26:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Absolutely.

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And we could be
mining the ocean floor.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:42.130 align:middle line:84%
But we haven't created
those things yet.

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:45.450 align:middle line:84%
They probably have, and
that's why they're here.

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Maybe their plan is dying or
died thousands of years ago,

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and they came to Earth and now
they can live under the ocean.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now Rick, we
mentioned and talked

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:58.260 align:middle line:84%
about this, that governments
have relationships

00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.410 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:02.220 align:middle line:84%
They work with us on
certain projects sometimes

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.630 align:middle line:90%
or in the labs.

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe these
extraterrestrials

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.610 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking
about on this episode

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:12.100 align:middle line:84%
are working with any
governments or military?

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Well, we know
J. Rod is at Area 51,

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and he's helped us in
reverse engineering.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:20.590 align:middle line:84%
I think that there
would be an alliance.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:24.840 align:middle line:84%
It would be beneficial to the
United States or other world

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.060 align:middle line:84%
governments and the
extraterrestrials

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.690 align:middle line:90%
to have an alliance.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:31.155 align:middle line:84%
Now if they're
going to live here,

00:27:31.155 --> 00:27:32.530 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
live down there.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And we know that they're down
there at the bottom of the ocean

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:35.930 align:middle line:90%
floor.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:38.970 align:middle line:84%
I believe it would be
beneficial to both parties

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:43.150 align:middle line:84%
to have some form of an alliance
to cooperate with each other.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Richard,
again, thank you

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.630 align:middle line:90%
so much for being on the show.

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:84%
It's always a
pleasure having you.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Thank you, Emery.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.770 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.620 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:28:04.000 align:middle line:90%
