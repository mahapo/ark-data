00:00:15.304 --> 00:00:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID WILCOCK: All right.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.270 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back to
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.160 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, David Wilcock.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.945 align:middle line:84%
And we are here, once again,
with our special guest insider

00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Emery Smith.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And Emery, I again want to
thank you so much for finally

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.197 align:middle line:90%
stepping forward to do this.

00:00:29.197 --> 00:00:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY SMITH: Well,
thank you, Dave.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.870 align:middle line:10%
It's been a long time, as you
know, around 10 years for me

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.870 align:middle line:10%
to come out and talk about it.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's time
for the people to know--

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.934 align:middle line:84%
to add to what you have
already been teaching.

00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:43.350 align:middle line:84%
But there's some
gaps there, and I

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.766 align:middle line:84%
want to help you
fill those if you

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:90%
have any questions with them.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.538 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: We had talked about
this briefing that I got from

00:00:48.538 --> 00:00:53.580 align:middle line:10%
Pete Peterson that was very
recent in this idea that he was

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.150 align:middle line:10%
following up on what he gave
us on a previous episode

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.420 align:middle line:10%
of "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: OK.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.401 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: We were talking about
the idea that there are these

00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:04.650 align:middle line:84%
vast carved tunnels
underground; smooth,

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.510 align:middle line:84%
almost glass-like
interior, like it's--

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Obsidian.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Melted rock, yeah.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So, you
know about this?

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, I know.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And he said
that, in some cases,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.300 align:middle line:90%
they follow the Nazca Lines.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.952 align:middle line:84%
And that there are these
chambers off the sides that

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:19.410 align:middle line:84%
look like people
were living there,

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:84%
but it appears that whoever was
there just took all the stuff

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:90%
out when they left.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.490 align:middle line:84%
So, could you just speak to that
for a second; that part of it?

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.747 align:middle line:84%
The idea that somebody might
have cleared everything out,

00:01:30.747 --> 00:01:32.330 align:middle line:84%
and it might not
have been us, per se,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.410 align:middle line:84%
but maybe it was the
beings themselves.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.970 align:middle line:84%
What do we know about why
it was so abandoned looking?

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, there's actually
a lot of the craft down there,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.747 align:middle line:84%
and they're connected
to many other tunnels.

00:01:44.747 --> 00:01:46.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
he was debriefed on,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.500 align:middle line:84%
but what I was debriefed on
is, you know, there's over, you

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:84%
know, 200 to 300
craft down there,

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.790 align:middle line:84%
and many beings that are kind
of petrified into the walls.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And it is like a lava
tube-type of cave system,

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.000 align:middle line:84%
where it was intentionally
melted, it looks like,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.230 align:middle line:90%
and frozen in--

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.390 align:middle line:90%
like frozen.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Some moment and some
sort of suspended animation,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.830 align:middle line:90%
I would say.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.121 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: Well, that is
interesting you said 200 to 300

00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:10%
craft, because this
briefing from Pete,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.010 align:middle line:10%
he was speculating that there
might be as many as possibly

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.345 align:middle line:10%
500 down there.

00:02:22.345 --> 00:02:23.145 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Oh.

00:02:23.145 --> 00:02:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So, that's
a very similar number.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, just in Mexico
alone, that area is about that.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.630 align:middle line:90%
But those go way down south too.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: So, this is a big
collective group of scientists,

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.300 align:middle line:84%
which have now just had to turn
it over to the US government.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So, another one of
the things that he said in this

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.070 align:middle line:84%
briefing-- that I've
never shared with anyone,

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.830 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just going to drop
it on camera right now--

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.420 align:middle line:84%
he said that the latest
intel that he's aware of

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.680 align:middle line:84%
is that there are evidence of
five different epochs on Earth

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.570 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
colonies that

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.050 align:middle line:84%
were fairly large and
fairly considerable

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:90%
when they happened.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:84%
That they're almost
all underground,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and he said that, of these
five eras, some of them

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.900 align:middle line:84%
go back millions of years and
that they are very different.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.300 align:middle line:84%
The type of technology;
the type of society;

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:84%
the way that everything looks;
it's all very different.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.220 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm wondering
if you ever heard

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.420 align:middle line:84%
about there being like
five major, if you will,

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.290 align:middle line:84%
ages of extraterrestrial
colonization of Earth?

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: I've heard up to five.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I've kind of known
of three, because

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.490 align:middle line:90%
of artifacts and beings.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.241 align:middle line:90%
But that's just secondhand.

00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:41.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, firsthand that
I've seen the stuff

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.810 align:middle line:84%
and read the briefings, and
I've seen some of the technology

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.770 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
bodies, of course.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.914 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, that is correct.

00:03:47.914 --> 00:03:50.330 align:middle line:84%
There must have been at least
five different civilizations

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.465 align:middle line:90%
that, you know--

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:53.090 align:middle line:84%
we're talking million
year gaps though.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.931 align:middle line:84%
We're talking, you know,
different times, you know?

00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think maybe that
might be correlated

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.930 align:middle line:84%
with the stuff in
Egypt and Antarctica,

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.420 align:middle line:84%
and you know, ancient
Lemuria and Atlantis.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:84%
It's all kind of tied
into different time zones,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.990 align:middle line:84%
because the symbols and
the things they're finding,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.210 align:middle line:84%
and all the equipment
and technology,

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.252 align:middle line:84%
is completely different,
like you said.

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:14.960 align:middle line:84%
So, there's a lot of
scientists out there

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.140 align:middle line:84%
they are hiring now to put
in like to crack this code

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.121 align:middle line:90%
like, what does this mean?

00:04:20.121 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:84%
And some of the stuff
they can't operate,

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
of course, because they don't
understand consciousness

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.540 align:middle line:84%
is just a technology,
number one.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Number two, it's such a higher
science that we're not even--

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:84%
we've never even learned
it, and it's so beyond us

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.290 align:middle line:84%
that we wouldn't be
able to understand it

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
if I was an ET talking to
you trying to explain it,

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:84%
because it would be
beyond your, you know--

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.220 align:middle line:84%
it would be beyond your
brain to assimilate that,

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.929 align:middle line:90%
knowing what you know now.

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:49.595 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: I was
particularly fascinated,

00:04:49.595 --> 00:04:53.360 align:middle line:10%
in the previous episode, when
you talked about the idea that

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.740 align:middle line:10%
similar ruins as Antarctica were
found in a cave in Costa Rica.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And I want to throw something
at you and see what you say.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.470 align:middle line:84%
One of the insiders
told me about a complex

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.620 align:middle line:84%
that was found
underground in Ecuador,

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and that Neil Armstrong and
certain other NASA astronauts

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.490 align:middle line:84%
were given the ability
to go in there.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.730 align:middle line:10%
It's very advanced;
it's very amazing,

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.710 align:middle line:10%
and it's similar to Antarctica.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.450 align:middle line:10%
And I've never found
another insider

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:10%
who had a corollary point of
data for that particular thing.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.400 align:middle line:84%
I've tried Pete, I've
tried Corey Goode.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.691 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know about Ecuador.

00:05:29.691 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: I did tell you
it was near Costa Rica--

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Oh.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: --on the last episode.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.956 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: So, correct.

00:05:34.956 --> 00:05:35.837 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I've been there.

00:05:35.837 --> 00:05:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: You've been
to the one in Ecuador?

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.830 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, from what I
heard, it's absolutely amazing.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yes, it seems to have
already started its own flora

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:90%
and fauna growing in this--

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.380 align:middle line:84%
there's a craft that crashed
there a very long time ago,

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.950 align:middle line:84%
and it still had some
sort of energy system on.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:84%
It must have carried extra
bacteria or something,

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.720 align:middle line:84%
because deep down in
there, it's actually

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.680 align:middle line:84%
kind of very bio-luminescent
type feeling,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.160 align:middle line:84%
and its atmosphere is a little
different than the atmosphere

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.960 align:middle line:90%
on top.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's not very deep under
the ground, so you know.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.120 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you that
the plant life down there

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:84%
is unlike anything I've
ever seen on Earth,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.300 align:middle line:90%
so that was really astounding.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Of course, some of
the little insects

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.470 align:middle line:84%
and other things that
were running around

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.290 align:middle line:90%
were also very different.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.090 align:middle line:90%
And this--

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: --this place is highly
guarded and has a really good

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.360 align:middle line:90%
security system.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's going to be
brought to the public because

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.810 align:middle line:84%
of other organizational
satellites are now picking up

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:47.320 align:middle line:84%
on inner Earth things just by
accident, so it's going to be

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.640 align:middle line:90%
hard for them to hide this one.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.540 align:middle line:90%
So, he is correct about this--

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.550 align:middle line:90%
did he call it a cave?

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.350 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: He just said it
was an underground complex.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.124 align:middle line:10%
>> SMITH: Right, it's
an underground complex.

00:06:57.124 --> 00:06:59.830 align:middle line:84%
But it really was
a craft that we

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.570 align:middle line:84%
think may have crashed there,
or stayed there at one point,

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and then they started
building around it.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And then, since it's so close
to the surface of the Earth,

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.630 align:middle line:84%
the water and it opened up
and runoff went in there

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.550 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
flora and fauna has

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.560 align:middle line:84%
mixed with this stuff,
whatever they brought,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.480 align:middle line:84%
or it could be the energy
from this craft in there

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.930 align:middle line:90%
that's changing all this stuff.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And I can't go into more
detail than just that.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.370 align:middle line:10%
It's been driving me
crazy that he used words

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.710 align:middle line:10%
like very amazing,
but then wouldn't

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.464 align:middle line:10%
give me any actual detail
of what we might see.

00:07:35.464 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:10%
So, could you give
us a little bit

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.230 align:middle line:10%
about what we might
see if, at some point,

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.480 align:middle line:10%
we get to go in there?

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, I can, I
just hate to use movies

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:90%
as a retrospect.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.760 align:middle line:10%
The--

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.780 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: But movies are
programmed with information

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.090 align:middle line:10%
to discredit whistleblowers.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It would make
"Avatar" land look like a--

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.020 align:middle line:90%
like a small school playground.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Everything in there
had fluid running through it.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.240 align:middle line:84%
The stems of the branches
look like it, you know,

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.540 align:middle line:84%
had fluid running
through everything.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.870 align:middle line:84%
There was light, you know,
Like light from everything,

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.870 align:middle line:84%
all different kinds
of shades of light.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.579 align:middle line:90%
Light I've never seen before.

00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Not just talking about
the colors of the rainbow,

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.890 align:middle line:90%
but so many amazing colors.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And the plants are
the most amazing thing

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and they're like conscious,
not like our-- of course,

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.580 align:middle line:84%
all plants are conscious, but
they are different in that way.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Everything down from the
leaves to the soil was sponge.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.600 align:middle line:84%
It was soil-- the
soil was all sponge,

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.159 align:middle line:84%
like you're walking on a
one inch foam mattress.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:45.180 align:middle line:84%
I could put it-- you know how
you feel that little gushy.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.590 align:middle line:90%
And everything is really humid.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And there were
little creatures--

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:55.090 align:middle line:84%
like little animals,
like the size of mice--

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.360 align:middle line:84%
there that were
like naked moles,

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:84%
like naked little shrews,
running around that

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:02.620 align:middle line:90%
were definitely different.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:07.010 align:middle line:84%
They actually had color that
was emanating from them,

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.010 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if it
was a reflection of light

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.801 align:middle line:84%
from the light that
was in there or if they

00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:11.890 align:middle line:90%
were emanating light.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:16.780 align:middle line:84%
I was not there to, you know,
talk about that specific thing.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.390 align:middle line:84%
I was there on some--
to do something else.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.760 align:middle line:84%
But it was the most
fascinating-- one

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.490 align:middle line:84%
of the most fascinating things
I've ever seen here on Earth.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe there's
a lot of other biospheres

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.000 align:middle line:90%
that are formed.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.790 align:middle line:84%
This one just got cracked
open somehow and mixed

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.620 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of our
stuff, and that's

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:33.910 align:middle line:90%
what they were concerned with.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.380 align:middle line:90%
Would it leave this area?

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.600 align:middle line:90%
And it can't.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.077 align:middle line:84%
The plants they
took out of there

00:09:39.077 --> 00:09:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and the animals they
took out of there

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.800 align:middle line:84%
could not survive on the
surface of our Earth.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So, it is its own
type of biosphere.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there is an
electromagnetic field

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:51.790 align:middle line:84%
that's protecting,
you know, the opening

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:57.910 align:middle line:84%
in that area from anything, you
know, going out or, you know,

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:90%
coming in.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Part of what he
meant by very amazing--

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and I'm really glad
to hear these details.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.710 align:middle line:90%
It's making a lot of sense now.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I'll just say this
first that, apparently, this

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:84%
was one of the ways that Neil
Armstrong and other astronauts

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.190 align:middle line:90%
were bribed to stay quiet.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And from what you're
describing, it

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.850 align:middle line:84%
sounds like it is so
incredible that you

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.520 align:middle line:84%
would want to stay quiet
just so you could go there

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.430 align:middle line:90%
more than once maybe.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:25.230 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, there was
an exchange of favors.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.620 align:middle line:84%
There's no money ever
exchanged in these programs,

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.540 align:middle line:90%
it's all favors.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't comply
and take the favor,

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.530 align:middle line:84%
then there's usually
a big problem.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Favor, such as bringing also
the astronauts to Antarctica,

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:42.090 align:middle line:90%
as you know.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:42.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.166 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: So-- and all of these
other places that are very

00:10:45.166 --> 00:10:49.470 align:middle line:84%
special in the planet that we
haven't even elaborated on yet,

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:50.430 align:middle line:90%
as this one is.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So, there's multiple
places like this, actually.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.350 align:middle line:84%
They're in the Earth
and around the Earth;

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.630 align:middle line:84%
it's just this one happened
to be cracked open like an egg

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.750 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.440 align:middle line:90%
and beautiful things come out.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: As for technology,
when he mentioned very amazing,

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:84%
he did imply to some degree that
there were things that looked

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.150 align:middle line:84%
like a really cool spaceship
that you would see when you

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.950 align:middle line:90%
went in there.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.241 align:middle line:84%
So, could you elaborate a
little on that part, as well?

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Like what's the interplay
between technology

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.380 align:middle line:84%
spaceship-looking
stuff and stuff

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.870 align:middle line:84%
that looks like the
gardens in "Avatar?"

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, the
craft there are light,

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and so, it's not something
you'd kick the tires on.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.340 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.010 align:middle line:90%
And the light is palpable.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And it is round and oval,
and it is very long and thin,

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.360 align:middle line:90%
but it's large.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.850 align:middle line:84%
It's fairly large,
what I saw, and I

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:45.440 align:middle line:84%
didn't get to go all
the way in, by the way.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.680 align:middle line:84%
I was only in the
first 300 yards,

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.790 align:middle line:84%
so, and that was enough
for me to be completely...

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.820 align:middle line:90%
my mouth dropped open.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And so this
light craft is palpable.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.470 align:middle line:84%
So, think of light
not being blinded

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.560 align:middle line:84%
like the lights we
have right now on us,

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:84%
but a light that glows that
you can see it and focus on it

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.630 align:middle line:90%
without being blinded.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And you can enter it from any
place you want on the craft

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.160 align:middle line:84%
once when you walk up
to it and touch it.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.989 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the biometric-type thing.

00:12:16.989 --> 00:12:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: I mean, that's
very interesting, Emery,

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.850 align:middle line:84%
because when Pete
was on "Cosmic"

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.960 align:middle line:84%
talking about this
craft in Antarctica,

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:31.030 align:middle line:84%
he described that it had
a sort of diffuse glow.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.330 align:middle line:84%
That everywhere was just light,
and no matter where you went,

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.850 align:middle line:84%
it seemed like the
light was always there.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And he also talked about
how one of the children that

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:44.320 align:middle line:84%
was brought in
for these programs

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.480 align:middle line:84%
figured out that you
could speak to the craft,

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.240 align:middle line:84%
and you could talk to it
and it would mold itself

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.030 align:middle line:84%
based on what you wanted it to
do and what you told it to do.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.160 align:middle line:84%
It was able to figure
out language or thought,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:56.650 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, definitely.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.508 align:middle line:84%
That's, you know, the
whole consciousness

00:12:59.508 --> 00:13:01.920 align:middle line:84%
is just a technology that
we call here today on Earth.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And the craft are all alive,
and you don't have to--

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.390 align:middle line:84%
to fly a craft, you just
have to kind of say go

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.210 align:middle line:90%
and where you want to go.

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:11.580 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And-- or think where
you want to go,

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.952 align:middle line:90%
and it'll get you there safely.

00:13:14.952 --> 00:13:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And wherever you
look in the craft,

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.270 align:middle line:84%
you can see completely
outside the craft,

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.880 align:middle line:84%
so no matter where
you look it opens up

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and you can see very
clearly exactly where you're

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
looking to a very wide
angle, including up and down.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And can you
also get binocular vision,

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.540 align:middle line:90%
like telescoping vision?

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.890 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: No.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:36.997 align:middle line:90%
I have not experienced that.

00:13:36.997 --> 00:13:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, one of the
things that Pete talked about

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.570 align:middle line:84%
was that our more
advanced fighter jets,

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:46.890 align:middle line:84%
the classified ones, have this
technology that goes through

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:84%
these nubs in your
shoulder blade.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.150 align:middle line:84%
If you feel your
shoulder blade, there's

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.520 align:middle line:84%
a little dimple in there,
and he said there's

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.470 align:middle line:90%
a lot of nerves that cross in.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And he was part of a
team that figured out

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.940 align:middle line:84%
how to pump signals in
through those points

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.730 align:middle line:84%
that they called ports,
and you can actually allow

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.800 align:middle line:90%
people who are blind to see.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And that on the jets, the
jets don't need windows,

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.340 align:middle line:84%
but you can look out
from your mind's eye

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.620 align:middle line:84%
and it's the same as vision,
except that it also has

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.630 align:middle line:90%
binocular telescoping function.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:15.720 align:middle line:90%
Do you know anything about that?

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: You mean you
don't need heads up display.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Not-- you need your--

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: It's in your head.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: You need your,
of course, protection.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.357 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's definitely true.

00:14:24.357 --> 00:14:25.440 align:middle line:90%
It's been out for a while.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.610 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of old technology.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: (CHUCKLING)
Old technology?

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Sorry.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- they
even make toys now,

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.820 align:middle line:84%
where you hook up something
to your finger and think,

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.840 align:middle line:84%
and the ball floats in the
air with a fan or something.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.620 align:middle line:84%
So, all that is real, and that's
kind of old technology compared

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.160 align:middle line:90%
to what we have now.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Especially with the new suit
program, and things like that,

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:50.700 align:middle line:84%
is all incorporated into, like
you said, into the helmet,

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.100 align:middle line:84%
where you can think,
like you just said,

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.270 align:middle line:90%
with some of these helmets.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.350 align:middle line:90%
And you can zoom in, zoom out.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:84%
You see in different
wavelengths and light,

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and you know, just
like you said.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.730 align:middle line:90%
So, very familiar with that.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.565 align:middle line:84%
I can definitely concur and
confirm what he said was true.

00:15:06.565 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, I guess since
we're on a technology theme

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.700 align:middle line:84%
here, let's talk about the
exosuit, or smart suit,

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.020 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want to call it.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.880 align:middle line:90%
So, could you tell us--

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.480 align:middle line:84%
now, you gave me some very
fascinating information

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.800 align:middle line:90%
about this suit before.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Oh my gosh,
so much fun, the suit.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:23.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: And you've actually
had the pleasure of using one.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.490 align:middle line:84%
So, tell us about
these smart suits.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Wow.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:84%
That's a big one, because
that's like a whole series.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Would you like me to start on
just the amazing technology

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.522 align:middle line:90%
that's embedded in it, such as--

00:15:40.522 --> 00:15:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, what
is it, first of all?

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, number one, it
was designed to be able to go

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.199 align:middle line:90%
anywhere, and--

00:15:47.199 --> 00:15:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Is it a
suit that you wear?

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.198 align:middle line:84%
Like what people-- we've got
to give people a visual first.

00:15:51.198 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Oh, OK.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.715 align:middle line:90%
Well, they way--

00:15:52.715 --> 00:15:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: What would you see
on somebody who is wearing one?

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.463 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: If you would see this
suit, what it would look like,

00:15:56.463 --> 00:15:59.460 align:middle line:84%
if someone had, like
a scuba suit on.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: A very small
amount of neoprene.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.623 align:middle line:84%
But it's not neoprene
at all, but it would--

00:16:03.623 --> 00:16:08.930 align:middle line:84%
it fits that tight, and
it's very, very thin.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And the suit has the ability
to absorb all the shock

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.710 align:middle line:84%
on your body, if you
were to jump, you know,

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.740 align:middle line:84%
40 feet off a cliff
onto the ground.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.660 align:middle line:84%
So, all the weight
is distributed

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:84%
into the whole suit, so your
body will feel nothing at all.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It also is
bulletproof, it's shockproof.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.830 align:middle line:84%
It's electromagnetic
proof, to an extent.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.820 align:middle line:84%
It has the capabilities, and
the helmet are just fascinating.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.370 align:middle line:84%
It is all
mind/thought-controlled,

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.110 align:middle line:84%
because it's actually connected
to you, like you said,

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.110 align:middle line:84%
with these little things
in your back, but not--

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: What about
things like heat and cold?

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, that's the best
thing about it is it will keep

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.880 align:middle line:84%
any temperature that,
you know, you want.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.820 align:middle line:84%
It actually measures
your body at all times,

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and knows how much
sweat you're sweating.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
It knows, you know,
how much air you're

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.030 align:middle line:84%
breathing, your body
temperature, your blood

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:90%
pressure, everything.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.740 align:middle line:84%
It also can tighten to
absorb impact, and release,

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.760 align:middle line:84%
so you can actually be so
comfortable wherever you're at.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.252 align:middle line:84%
So, you won't even feel it,
you'll feel like you're naked.

00:17:13.252 --> 00:17:15.710 align:middle line:84%
But in a time where you're
about to move it all tightens up

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and activates, you
know, in nanoseconds.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:24.710 align:middle line:84%
It's made as a super soldier
suit to replace the old,

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.280 align:middle line:84%
you know, dilithium
"Predator" suits that

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:84%
just were, basically,
for the camouflage,

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:33.210 align:middle line:84%
but you had to wear
armor underneath those.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:34.940 align:middle line:84%
So, now this one has
different, because I

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.490 align:middle line:84%
think it has different
types of composites

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:38.720 align:middle line:90%
in it and [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well,
dilithium predator suit.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.796 align:middle line:84%
So, please explain what is-- the
movie "Predator," of course--

00:17:44.796 --> 00:17:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Oh, that's just--

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.295 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: The
being in "Predator"

00:17:47.295 --> 00:17:48.770 align:middle line:90%
is like sometimes invisible.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: But it has this
thing on its arm that you can--

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, it's the
pop culture term, you know?

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:54.380 align:middle line:90%
I never use--

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't use the real
terms for these devices.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: But you know, this
type of suit, basically,

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:06.080 align:middle line:90%
are small round, like pyramids.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.120 align:middle line:84%
But they're round--
they're faceted.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And at the bottom of
the pyramid is a mirror.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And these are very, very
small; smaller than--

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:84%
they're about, I think,
0.3 of a millimeter of a--

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah, 0.03 or 0.3.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So, there's thousands of
them per cubic centimeter.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And what happens
is, when light hits it,

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.310 align:middle line:84%
it reflects the light
that's around you, you know,

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:33.020 align:middle line:90%
that's in front of you.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And it also-- with
the old suits,

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.400 align:middle line:84%
it would reflect basically
what was behind you,

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.010 align:middle line:84%
because you wanted to
stand up against something,

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.890 align:middle line:84%
and you want to see the chair,
you don't want to see me.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.290 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't very
effective, but it's

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.030 align:middle line:84%
really good, of course, at night
and it's good during the day,

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.330 align:middle line:84%
if you're in some
jungle warfare.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's not as good as the
one in the movie, of course,

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:58.260 align:middle line:84%
but it was darn good, and it
saved a lot of people's lives.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:90%
So, that's what that is.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.790 align:middle line:84%
The upgrade from
that is, let's get

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:08.570 align:middle line:84%
a suit that's better than Iron
Man, but gives you mobility,

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:10.345 align:middle line:84%
so you don't ever
have to take it off.

00:19:10.345 --> 00:19:12.370 align:middle line:84%
You could wear it
for seven days.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: It cleans you?

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.898 align:middle line:84%
So, that was what they're
doing-- and gives you

00:19:17.898 --> 00:19:19.580 align:middle line:90%
nutrients, at the same time.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: You don't
need to eat and drink.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: You don't
need to eat or drink,

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:22.900 align:middle line:84%
because it goes
through your skin,

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.530 align:middle line:84%
because they have now developed
a way to have nutrients

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.422 align:middle line:84%
and water absorbed
through the skin.

00:19:28.422 --> 00:19:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Do you have to kind
of get past an initial hunger

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.230 align:middle line:90%
feeling to--

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, everyone still,
you know, eats and drinks,

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.500 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not like, you know--
it's just for if you had to.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: OK.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: You know,
you wouldn't have to.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: But you know, the suit
does have to be maintenanced,

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:90%
you know, like a jet.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:49.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you can
just wear it for a year.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's charged with a very
special type of water that's

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.710 align:middle line:84%
charged, and that's
how they do it.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:01.682 align:middle line:84%
That's how it actually operates
through this charged plasma.

00:20:01.682 --> 00:20:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Is there any little
box or bump on it that's like

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:04.410 align:middle line:90%
it's--

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: No, it's
flawless, seamless.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.905 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: It does have
like a Ziploc feature,

00:20:08.905 --> 00:20:11.230 align:middle line:84%
like a suit would,
when you get into it.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:15.190 align:middle line:84%
All suits are made
specifically for the operator.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.410 align:middle line:84%
It has to be, because
it won't work correctly.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:19.700 align:middle line:84%
You could actually-- if
you were to jump in my suit

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.200 align:middle line:84%
and then try to go
do something, you

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.520 align:middle line:90%
could actually hurt yourself.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Makes sense.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.376 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: So, what they're
trying to do now is make an all

00:20:25.376 --> 00:20:26.650 align:middle line:90%
in one that contours.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Like it has its own
like AI to know, oh,

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.200 align:middle line:90%
so anyone can use these suits.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So, in the future, they'll
probably have that.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
problem with the helmets

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.840 align:middle line:90%
that they're having with it.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.880 align:middle line:90%
But I'm sure it's fixed by now.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Before we get to that,
what could you tell us about

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.990 align:middle line:84%
things like, for example,
running and jumping if you had

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.790 align:middle line:90%
the suit on?

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.500 align:middle line:84%
What would be
different about that?

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, you can
run up to 38 miles an hour.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And it
won't let you fall.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:03.520 align:middle line:84%
It's got a special
system in it that--

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.940 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand the suit
has billions of these lines,

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:11.080 align:middle line:84%
these like, let's say, like
dental floss lines in it.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.320 align:middle line:84%
So, each thing can
tighten anywhere.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.530 align:middle line:90%
So, if you did--

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.510 align:middle line:84%
you know, it absorbs every
bullet that comes to you,

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:18.310 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're not bulletproof,
but for the most part,

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.690 align:middle line:90%
it'll stop a 223, no problem.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: So, what happens is it
knows if you're getting wobbly

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and about to fall, and it'll put
pressure on that and that whole

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:84%
side the suit will tighten to
realign you so you can keep

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.400 align:middle line:90%
going.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:36.744 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Because you can--

00:21:36.744 --> 00:21:39.220 align:middle line:84%
it is made to actually
run through any terrain,

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.160 align:middle line:84%
like very rocky
terrain, and also carry

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.970 align:middle line:90%
a lot of weight with you.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.255 align:middle line:84%
So, you could actually
jump off a cliff,

00:21:48.255 --> 00:21:50.380 align:middle line:84%
do a back flip-- even though
you're not a gymnast--

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and you will land on
your feet like a cat.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.500 align:middle line:84%
It will not allow you to land
on your head or hurt yourself.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And the suit will take over and,
you know, curl you into a ball

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and make sure you're going
to land on your feet.

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.090 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:10.050 align:middle line:84%
It also has little types of
things that can project out.

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:13.210 align:middle line:84%
The suit can actually project
out little fins and things

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:18.180 align:middle line:84%
on it for swimming, and also for
when you-- if you did mess up

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:84%
and you are actually jumping
too high to change the way

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.000 align:middle line:84%
you're falling, in case you
were unconscious, let's say.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So, what about
jumping, in particular?

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:27.560 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about jumping.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Jumping is amazing.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:35.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could jump, I
think, up to around 50 feet--

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:42.130 align:middle line:84%
50, 55 feet from the ground
with no pack, with no weight.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Weight is-- you have any little
weight on you, it calibrates it

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.760 align:middle line:84%
and that does affect
everything for the suit.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.740 align:middle line:90%
And the suit self-calibrates.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.220 align:middle line:84%
It's reverse-engineered
extraterrestrial technology

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.830 align:middle line:90%
that they use.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:23:00.010 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely not something
that we just thought

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.780 align:middle line:90%
of brilliantly and made.

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So, it is something
that is using

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.730 align:middle line:84%
a lot of this other technology,
and it was developed only

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:10.870 align:middle line:84%
for like really, really upper
class special ops projects

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:14.050 align:middle line:84%
people, which has nothing
to do with the government.

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:18.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about a very higher
level of, you know, things.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:23.830 align:middle line:84%
So, now we have the opportunity
to bring this to the world,

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.360 align:middle line:84%
without all the
special features,

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.120 align:middle line:84%
but the protective features that
we would like to give it to,

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.647 align:middle line:90%
of course, you know--

00:23:30.647 --> 00:23:32.980 align:middle line:84%
start off with like the police
officers and the firemen,

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.784 align:middle line:90%
and stuff, because it's amazing.

00:23:34.784 --> 00:23:36.700 align:middle line:84%
It can protect you from
heat, of course, cold.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.533 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: All right.

00:23:37.533 --> 00:23:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's be a little
more specific though.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.660 align:middle line:90%
When you say we--

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Right.

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:45.005 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: --could you be more
specific about who is we?

00:23:45.005 --> 00:23:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And how would this suit be
able to get out to the public?

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.421 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: The people who
have invented this suit,

00:23:49.421 --> 00:23:53.130 align:middle line:84%
I'll just say, want to
see it put to good use.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And there's other, you
know, types of these suits,

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:59.805 align:middle line:84%
of course, that can do other
things that are, you know,

00:23:59.805 --> 00:24:01.900 align:middle line:90%
war-like type things.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.202 align:middle line:84%
So, instead of doing, you
know, going that level--

00:24:05.202 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:84%
because these are prototypes,
you have to understand.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.170 align:middle line:84%
This is not available yet
for any-- you know, too many.

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:12.700 align:middle line:90%
So, these are all prototypes.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.725 align:middle line:84%
So, they're out there,
you know, thinking,

00:24:14.725 --> 00:24:16.810 align:middle line:84%
you know, what are they
going to do with it?

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:18.240 align:middle line:84%
The reason I got
involved with it

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.900 align:middle line:84%
was because they needed
a substance that I had,

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and it was, if you could get
us the substance for the suit,

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:28.530 align:middle line:84%
to make it levitate, then
we can make a deal with you

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:29.910 align:middle line:90%
with the suit.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.530 align:middle line:84%
We can give you your own suit,
but you know, we have to,

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:33.780 align:middle line:90%
of course, keep the suit.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.821 align:middle line:84%
But you can have it, you
know, whenever you want.

00:24:35.821 --> 00:24:38.349 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you can't, you
know, go running around cities

00:24:38.349 --> 00:24:39.890 align:middle line:84%
with it or show it
off, but you know,

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.430 align:middle line:84%
you can go to
undisclosed huge places

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.970 align:middle line:84%
out in the middle of nowhere
in the United States and have,

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:47.190 align:middle line:84%
you know, do your
own testing on it.

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I wanted to do,
because I knew the materials

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.760 align:middle line:90%
that it was made with.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Especially the helmet
I was working with,

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.001 align:middle line:84%
which is completely
separate from the suit,

00:24:54.001 --> 00:24:57.259 align:middle line:84%
but it was going to
be made for the suit.

00:24:57.259 --> 00:24:58.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was
completely materials

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.590 align:middle line:84%
I knew were extraterrestrial
origin that they just

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:02.892 align:middle line:90%
reverse-engineered.

00:25:02.892 --> 00:25:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: You kind of quickly
said something about it

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:05.790 align:middle line:90%
levitating.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:07.893 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: What does
that mean exactly?

00:25:07.893 --> 00:25:08.885 align:middle line:90%
How would it levitate?

00:25:08.885 --> 00:25:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, levitation on
this suit would have to do with

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:13.980 align:middle line:90%
white gold.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.420 align:middle line:84%
They needed the pure white
gold from the ancient times.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.943 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: But what
kind of levitation?

00:25:19.943 --> 00:25:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Could you be more specific?

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.374 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, the suit
is consciousness assisted,

00:25:23.374 --> 00:25:28.050 align:middle line:84%
so by mixing these properties
of the suit with this special

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:30.977 align:middle line:84%
white gold, you'll
be able to levitate.

00:25:30.977 --> 00:25:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you can actually levitate.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:33.731 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: To how
much of a degree?

00:25:33.731 --> 00:25:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: As much as you want.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: And if the suit
was built correctly enough,

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.554 align:middle line:90%
you could go to space with it.

00:25:40.554 --> 00:25:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well, it is
strange, because occasionally,

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.420 align:middle line:84%
here and there, you get
these stories sometimes--

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.610 align:middle line:84%
there was one in
Australia recently--

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:51.990 align:middle line:84%
of what appears to be a
man levitating in the air.

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:53.074 align:middle line:90%
You know, a human figure--

00:25:53.074 --> 00:25:53.906 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Oh, right.

00:25:53.906 --> 00:25:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: --just
levitating in the air.

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:59.499 align:middle line:84%
How many of these suits are
out there for people to test?

00:25:59.499 --> 00:26:00.665 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: There's only two--

00:26:00.665 --> 00:26:02.920 align:middle line:90%
I only know of two suits.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.460 align:middle line:84%
I only know of two
suits of this--

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.390 align:middle line:90%
from this manufacturer.

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:10.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there's
many other suits.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've seen many
Ironman-type things out there,

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.800 align:middle line:84%
you know, like real--
that kind of thing.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.650 align:middle line:90%
But not to-- not like this.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Right.

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Because this
is beyond, you know,

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:25.160 align:middle line:90%
nuts and bolts.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Sure.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And I want to point out that
Corey Goode, when I brought

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:30.940 align:middle line:84%
this up to him,
he said that they

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.900 align:middle line:84%
had this in his secret space
program, and he used them.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And he did say that there was a
momentary type of anti-gravity,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.420 align:middle line:84%
that if you fell for like
the last two or three feet

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.360 align:middle line:84%
before you hit the
ground, it had enough gas

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.299 align:middle line:84%
to kind of levitate you
before you hit the ground,

00:26:49.299 --> 00:26:50.590 align:middle line:90%
so you make a smoother landing.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:54.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's only a short term
brief levitational capability.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, the suit
for jumping and for landing,

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.690 align:middle line:84%
with the suits that I'm
aware with, had none of that.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.010 align:middle line:84%
It had-- was using
electromagnetic fields

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:04.810 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Oh, really?

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.833 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: And also,
we've seen movies,

00:27:07.833 --> 00:27:13.000 align:middle line:10%
like "The Edge of Tomorrow," the
Tom Cruise film-- "live, die,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.140 align:middle line:10%
repeat"--

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:18.340 align:middle line:10%
where he-- the soldiers have
these big bulky metallic

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:21.415 align:middle line:10%
chassis, and they can like
move parked cars with them,

00:27:21.415 --> 00:27:22.290 align:middle line:10%
and things like this.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:24.910 align:middle line:84%
That's very old
school technology.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:27.610 align:middle line:84%
It's used in every
secret project.

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:29.630 align:middle line:84%
They're very common
in underground bases.

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Really?

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Exoskeletons,
like you saw in the movies,

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:37.100 align:middle line:84%
even in the "Alien" movies with
Sigourney Weaver and stuff,

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:37.900 align:middle line:90%
those big ones.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.690 align:middle line:90%
They're much more smaller now.

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:43.240 align:middle line:84%
They contour to
your body easier.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.810 align:middle line:84%
They're very adjustable,
and they're not as bulky.

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And you can, you know, lift
10 times your own weight.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.500 align:middle line:84%
You can lift-- you're a
human forklift is what it is.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:59.590 align:middle line:84%
But you're not-- it's not
made for jumping, or acrobats,

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:02.860 align:middle line:84%
or you know, running at
high speeds, the ones

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:03.750 align:middle line:90%
that I'm aware of.

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:07.600 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID: What could it do for
you if you get a laceration

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.340 align:middle line:10%
or a broken bone, or
something like that?

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Does it have any
countermeasures for that?

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Absolutely.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.440 align:middle line:84%
The suit itself will contract
on that to stop the bleeding

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and add an coagulating factor
to that, built into the suit.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:20.721 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Not only does it
give you vitamins, minerals,

00:28:20.721 --> 00:28:23.770 align:middle line:84%
electrolytes, nutrients,
and other special proteins

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:24.877 align:middle line:90%
and amino acids--

00:28:24.877 --> 00:28:26.710 align:middle line:84%
so you can communicate
with the suit better,

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and the suit
communicates with you--

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.520 align:middle line:90%
but it also can set your leg.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:34.610 align:middle line:84%
So, leg breaks, that
becomes now one solid piece.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Wow.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes.

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:37.730 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: What about the pain?

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.220 align:middle line:90%
Does it have--

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah,
it can give pain,

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.880 align:middle line:84%
if you direct it to give pain,
or if there's also operator

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.200 align:middle line:90%
induced.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, like if you have
the satellite-- of course,

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.260 align:middle line:84%
comes with a satellite--
and the satellite will know.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And someone usually is
communicating with you

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:56.130 align:middle line:90%
from somewhere with it.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:58.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're never, you
know, just running around,

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.650 align:middle line:90%
and this kind of thing.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is completely
the prototype, by the way.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So, what would happen
if you're feeling a great deal

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.460 align:middle line:90%
of fear, anxiety?

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.085 align:middle line:84%
Would the suit know
that you're afraid?

00:29:08.085 --> 00:29:09.918 align:middle line:84%
Would it have any way
to help you with that?

00:29:09.918 --> 00:29:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yes, it measures
pheromones and chemicals

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.270 align:middle line:90%
in your body, constantly.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:17.890 align:middle line:90%
So, it's a constant laboratory.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:20.300 align:middle line:84%
So, it knows if your
adrenaline goes up.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.507 align:middle line:84%
Knows when your
heart rate goes up.

00:29:22.507 --> 00:29:24.340 align:middle line:84%
It knows-- you know,
it will analyze things.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And plus, don't
forget, it's usually

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.162 align:middle line:84%
connected to also a team
that's watching you,

00:29:28.162 --> 00:29:30.620 align:middle line:84%
and they will take precautionary
methods and may, you know,

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:34.280 align:middle line:84%
administer epinephrine, you
know, or morphine, or you know,

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.690 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is for you
need to be extracted out

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:40.510 align:middle line:84%
of where you're at, if
you were really that hurt.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Does it have any
aromatherapy capability?

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Not that I'm aware of.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember seeing
anything like that.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.780 align:middle line:90%
I was not debriefed on that.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.196 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Well,
it is interesting,

00:29:49.196 --> 00:29:51.834 align:middle line:84%
because Corey's version of the
suit is almost exactly the same

00:29:51.834 --> 00:29:52.750 align:middle line:90%
as what you're saying.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.458 align:middle line:84%
One of the only things
I remember he said

00:29:54.458 --> 00:29:57.714 align:middle line:84%
was that if you were
upset, at certain times,

00:29:57.714 --> 00:29:59.380 align:middle line:84%
it would give you a
smell like lavender,

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.559 align:middle line:84%
or whatever smell you like
it can generate that for you.

00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: You know, what
it does, with this suit,

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.880 align:middle line:84%
is it doesn't use
pharmaceuticals.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:12.590 align:middle line:84%
It uses-- your body has its own
chemicals to deal with stress.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is why it's
so important that each suit is

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.840 align:middle line:84%
made for you is because once
we do get your blood test,

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.870 align:middle line:84%
we actually measure all
those chemicals in there

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:25.900 align:middle line:84%
that, you know, actually
initiate fight or flight

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:26.710 align:middle line:90%
movements.

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So, it could give
you really quick

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:30.730 align:middle line:84%
some dopamine and
serotonin, which is cool,

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:34.550 align:middle line:84%
though it's an autologous
dopamine and serotonin.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And autologous means it
comes from your own body,

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.500 align:middle line:90%
it's just concentrated.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:43.060 align:middle line:84%
So, it has the ability to help
you heal and cure you, and add

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:46.900 align:middle line:84%
your own chemicals that
you would need to do that,

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.140 align:middle line:84%
so you won't have to, you
know, take anything else.

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Like it alleviates all that
pharmaceutical-type stuff.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: If this were to be
distributed to the public,

00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:02.680 align:middle line:84%
how would we prevent
somebody from, essentially--

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.312 align:middle line:84%
like a terrorist-- to becoming
an indestructible super villain

00:31:06.312 --> 00:31:07.270 align:middle line:90%
by having a suit like--

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I guess other
people with the suit

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.090 align:middle line:90%
could defeat somebody like that.

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yes, it's not--

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: How would you stop
that from being misused?

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, that-- you know,
that's the whole thing.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So, I think the
slow release would

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.570 align:middle line:90%
be to like the police officers.

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And plus, it would be
downgraded to just do

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.080 align:middle line:90%
for what they needed.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:23.980 align:middle line:90%
Bulletproof.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.270 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't get to jump.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:27.410 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't get
to run as fast.

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:29.150 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't have
as many fibers in it.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:32.005 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't have all the
nutrients and all that stuff.

00:31:32.005 --> 00:31:34.750 align:middle line:84%
It would probably have more
stuff to protect the person.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:37.120 align:middle line:84%
More of just a protective
suit, but nothing else

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.440 align:middle line:84%
to be a superhero-type
thing, you know?

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of how they want
to launch that for civilians.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And then make a
civilian one that

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.850 align:middle line:84%
helps with people that are
sick, or helps that people

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:50.126 align:middle line:90%
have dangerous jobs even--

00:31:50.126 --> 00:31:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Like a lifeguard.

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Like a lifeguard,
or welders, or you know,

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.180 align:middle line:84%
people that deal in dangerous
positions where they get

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:55.270 align:middle line:90%
burned.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID: Firemen.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Yeah, firemen,
like we just talked about.

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know,
that would trickle

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:02.860 align:middle line:84%
down to the future suits
of just everyone being

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.310 align:middle line:84%
able to have one, you know,
that it just kind of keeps

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.350 align:middle line:84%
you healthy and
keeps you strong,

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.000 align:middle line:84%
and you know, that
kind of thing.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: Is the production of
something like this technology

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.519 align:middle line:84%
kind of similar to how our chips
in our smartphones keep getting

00:32:16.519 --> 00:32:18.310 align:middle line:84%
better and better, and,
as they get better,

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:19.972 align:middle line:90%
then they're mass produced?

00:32:19.972 --> 00:32:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And now it's not
expensive anymore,

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:22.590 align:middle line:90%
because we're making them.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Could the suits ultimately
get to be a consumer level

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.800 align:middle line:90%
price, do you think?

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:30.370 align:middle line:84%

wouldn't have all, you know--

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:31.810 align:middle line:84%

with features.

You know, it's all about that.

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, you wouldn't be
able to get the X-phone 20,

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:38.260 align:middle line:84%

Inside joke.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.810 align:middle line:84%
But yes, I mean,
that's how it works.

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:46.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't think--
by that time, I do

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:50.260 align:middle line:84%
believe that we won't
need to do that.

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.840 align:middle line:84%
I think these things will
be able to be handed out

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.230 align:middle line:90%
to everyone.

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:55.901 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're
not going to--

00:32:55.901 --> 00:32:58.150 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be moving
away from this consumer thing

00:32:58.150 --> 00:32:59.290 align:middle line:90%

leave this unturned.

00:33:03.836 --> 00:33:05.710 align:middle line:84%
You said there was a
problem with the helmet.

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:07.335 align:middle line:84%
Could you describe
what the problem is?

00:33:07.335 --> 00:33:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Why wouldn't the helmet be good?

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: The helmet is amazing.

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.379 align:middle line:84%
The problem with the helmet
is pressurization and

00:33:13.379 --> 00:33:14.920 align:middle line:84%
communicating with
the suit, since it

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.040 align:middle line:90%
was a different developer.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.460 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- the helmet
works flawlessly.

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:24.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just it's not
connecting to the suit

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.520 align:middle line:84%
correctly, because the
suit is so perfectly

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:33.430 align:middle line:84%
sculpted to the body that the
helmet is actually not, OK?

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:35.630 align:middle line:90%
So, it is a little bit bulkier.

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Small-- much smaller
than a motorcycle helmet.

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:39.770 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's the problem, right
now, they're having with that.

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:44.990 align:middle line:90%
But it's probably fixed by now.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:47.381 align:middle line:90%
That was in last summer.

00:33:47.381 --> 00:33:48.380 align:middle line:90%
I mean, not last summer.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:50.180 align:middle line:90%
That was the year before last.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: So, are we correct in
saying that you have been given

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:57.830 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity to become
a distributor for this,

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.730 align:middle line:90%
as it rolls out to the public?

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH: Yeah.

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:04.220 align:middle line:84%
More like a connector, I
like to consider myself.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:08.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm not so much on the
business aspects of that stuff

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:10.489 align:middle line:84%
as I have so many
other things going on.

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:12.800 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to connect
that, so it's, you know,

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.340 align:middle line:84%
put to good use to protect the
people that are protecting us

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.320 align:middle line:84%
right now, you know,
that are out there,

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.080 align:middle line:84%
such as the police
officers, and the fireman,

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and the paramedics,
and you know,

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.399 align:middle line:84%
all of these other people
in the civilian world.

00:34:25.399 --> 00:34:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, it's getting
kind of crazy out there,

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:28.730 align:middle line:90%
and they need some help.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.219 align:middle line:84%
They need to be
a little bit more

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:33.920 align:middle line:84%
ahead of the game with
these asymmetrical threats.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And you know, these things can,
along with the helmets also,

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:40.739 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's no way
something can sneak up on you,

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:41.929 align:middle line:90%
so.

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: I'm curious about
things like international law

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:48.409 align:middle line:84%
and the United Nations, and how
they might feel if a particular

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:51.820 align:middle line:84%
military gained access
to this technology.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:54.949 align:middle line:84%
And they would have such a
disproportionate advantage

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:57.920 align:middle line:84%
in war, that if the command
structure of that country

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.140 align:middle line:84%
were to become
compromised, they could

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:03.355 align:middle line:84%
enact some kind of global
dictatorship of some kind.

00:35:03.355 --> 00:35:05.084 align:middle line:84%
Are there any
thoughts about that?

00:35:05.084 --> 00:35:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>> SMITH: Well, that's just
an opinion, I would say.

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:08.480 align:middle line:84%
They didn't ever
talk about-- they

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.646 align:middle line:90%
don't talk about that stuff.

Manufacturers and
inventors, and you

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.270 align:middle line:84%
know, politicians-- or
I mean, not politicians,

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:18.260 align:middle line:84%
but the people that run those
corporations, they do not,

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.730 align:middle line:90%
you know, think about long term.

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:21.710 align:middle line:84%
They're more about who's
going to, you know,

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:24.080 align:middle line:84%
pay the biggest money, and
how they're going to do this

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.190 align:middle line:90%
and we need that.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.080 align:middle line:84%
But luckily, with
this group, they're

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.742 align:middle line:84%
more compassionate,
because they're, you

00:35:29.742 --> 00:35:31.010 align:middle line:90%
know, about it because--

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I can't say any more about
them, because I'll be--

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:39.340 align:middle line:84%
my-- you know, I just can't
talk about them personally.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And then so-- but their
heart's in the right spot,

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:45.650 align:middle line:84%
is what I'm saying, and
they want to do good.

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And they don't necessarily
need it, you know, to do war.

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:50.810 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And it still hasn't
gone that way yet.

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:56.180 align:middle line:84%
But that's where it
definitely could easily go.

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:59.741 align:middle line:90%
I don't think any, you know--

00:35:59.741 --> 00:36:03.230 align:middle line:84%
with all the drones out today
and all the other, you know,

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:06.790 align:middle line:84%
things we have that do
not require a human being

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:10.280 align:middle line:84%
to be in to get the job
done is where it's going.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:13.300 align:middle line:84%
So, that's more of
a threat, you know,

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.190 align:middle line:84%
for a drone to drop
out of a satellite

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and be instantly deployed
upon an area with stealth mode

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.950 align:middle line:84%
and just, you know, that with
the simple technology of today.

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:25.364 align:middle line:84%
That's so archaic, I
call it that, you know?

00:36:25.364 --> 00:36:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID: I mean, it really does
sound to me, just to summarize,

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:31.272 align:middle line:84%
that as disclosure
starts to happen,

00:36:31.272 --> 00:36:33.730 align:middle line:84%
there are going to be so many
surprises that we hadn't even

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:37.960 align:middle line:84%
anticipated that, just
this technology alone,

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.230 align:middle line:90%
is like "Ascension," in a sense.

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.460 align:middle line:90%
