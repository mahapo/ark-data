00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD C. DOTY:
So this first mission,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.830 align:middle line:84%
they go out on a
newer Cronus craft.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.240 align:middle line:90%
They call it Cronus 2.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.360 align:middle line:84%
They find this portal, they go
through the portal and they find

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:28.310 align:middle line:84%
themselves in our solar system
4,000 years into the future.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And as they approach
Earth, the spacecraft

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.120 align:middle line:90%
was captured in a net.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.560 align:middle line:84%
The planet seemed
to be the same,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.250 align:middle line:84%
although everything
is built up in almost

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.853 align:middle line:90%
an anti-gravity environment.

00:00:41.853 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH GOLEMBESKE: OK, so is
there any other interactions

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.950 align:middle line:84%
or anything important you'd
like to share about this event?

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.276 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah, a
very important part.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:10%
>> JOSH: Time travel sounds
like science fiction,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.010 align:middle line:10%
but what if it already happened?

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.510 align:middle line:10%
Today, we're talking about the
Cronus mission's secret flights

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:10%
that have sent US astronauts
thousands of years

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.140 align:middle line:10%
into the future.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.560 align:middle line:10%
Joining me is Richard Doty,
a former Air Force OSI

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.810 align:middle line:10%
agent with direct involvement
in classified programs.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm guest host, Josh Golembeske,
let's dive right into it.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.818 align:middle line:90%
Rick, welcome back to the show.

00:01:18.818 --> 00:01:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Good to be here, Josh.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: OK, I'm fired
up for this conversation.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.368 align:middle line:84%
I know in the last
episode, we went

00:01:23.368 --> 00:01:26.430 align:middle line:84%
over the basics of
the MINOT program

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.930 align:middle line:84%
and the construction
of the Cronus craft.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to dive
into the juicy stuff,

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.410 align:middle line:90%
the actual missions.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So please, I know we
talked about one test

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:84%
mission to the moon and back,
but that didn't involve portals.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to
talk about time travel

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.920 align:middle line:90%
to some point in the future.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.940 align:middle line:84%
So can you please walk me
through the first mission

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.080 align:middle line:90%
for Cronus?

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: The first mission
was a very exciting mission

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.890 align:middle line:84%
because, number one, even though
the astronauts were trained,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.630 align:middle line:90%
they didn't know what to expect.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.780 align:middle line:84%
We talked a little about what
they would have experienced.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, they didn't know
exactly where this portal was,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.050 align:middle line:84%
but they knew that once they got
to it, the outer skin of Cronus

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.150 align:middle line:84%
would take over along with
this pathway box, which

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.770 align:middle line:84%
apparently worked
together with the skin,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.020 align:middle line:84%
open up or curved time, and
allowed that craft to go

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:90%
into the portal.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's one of
the problems that

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:84%
plagued the planners
and the astronauts.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.492 align:middle line:84%
OK, we know approximately where
this portal is, near Mars.

00:02:42.492 --> 00:02:44.700 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go out and
we're going to get into it,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going to travel
through this portal to parts

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:84%
unknown, because they didn't
know exactly where they

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:90%
were coming out.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
this for a fact,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.290 align:middle line:84%
but I'm sure they must
have asked J-Rod, OK,

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.620 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go to this
portal, portal XYZ, whatever,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.472 align:middle line:90%
however they refer to it.

00:03:03.472 --> 00:03:04.680 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go through it.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going to end up?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if J.
Rod said, well, you're

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.870 align:middle line:84%
going to end up at this
point in space or whatever.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.460 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know, but
they were prepared.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.470 align:middle line:84%
The astronauts were
trained in star navigation.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Every single Air Force pilot is
trained to navigate by the stars

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.160 align:middle line:90%
or by the constellations.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So they knew that they had to
steady before they went out

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.730 align:middle line:84%
there, because if they got
out there to a certain place,

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.230 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know
where they were at.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.330 align:middle line:10%
They'd have to look
at the constellations,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.230 align:middle line:10%
star groups and figure out,
based on their knowledge

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:10%
and training, where they were
and how far into the future

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.760 align:middle line:10%
they were.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:10%
That's something that was very
interesting for the planners

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.810 align:middle line:10%
and the organizers of
this mission is, OK,

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.580 align:middle line:10%
where are you going to end up?

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.050 align:middle line:10%
What are you going to see?

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.760 align:middle line:10%
What are you going to record?

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.610 align:middle line:84%
They did have
recording equipment,

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I guess video or some
kind of recording.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Ben didn't explain
exactly what it was,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.620 align:middle line:84%
but he said we had
recording equipment.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So this first
mission, they go out,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
excited to get
through this portal.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.399 align:middle line:84%
They go through this
portal and the pixelization

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.140 align:middle line:84%
and all this horrible
things happens to the body,

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.110 align:middle line:90%
but they come out of it.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And they come out of it and
they're propelled really fast.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.260 align:middle line:90%
And then they slow down.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.390 align:middle line:90%
Now they're in deep space.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.650 align:middle line:90%
They're not near a planet.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.970 align:middle line:90%
They're not near a star.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.250 align:middle line:90%
They're just someplace in space.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.900 align:middle line:84%
So it took them some time to
look out and orient themselves.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And based on star charts and
other things that they used--

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know, and Ben
didn't explain everything

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.240 align:middle line:90%
that they were using--

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.800 align:middle line:84%
but they figured they were
40,000 years into the future

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.140 align:middle line:84%
at a point in space within
the constellation of Taurus.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Taurus?

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.523 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: So they
knew they were there,

00:04:55.523 --> 00:05:01.560 align:middle line:84%
but they realized and they based
the 40,000 years on just how

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:84%
the constellations
move and how--

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.400 align:middle line:84%
so they realized that they
were approximately 40,000 years

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:90%
into the future.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's mind-boggling to think
that you go through this portal,

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.220 align:middle line:84%
you enter at A-- and I always
use A and B because I kind

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.600 align:middle line:84%
of have math mind-- but A and
then you go through this and you

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:84%
come out B, and now
you're 40,000 light years

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.950 align:middle line:90%
into the future?

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:90%
How can that possibly happen?

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.990 align:middle line:84%
But there are
scientists out there--

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.290 align:middle line:84%
I can't, I'm not a
physicist-- that can

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle line:90%
figure that out and explain it.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.460 align:middle line:84%
That portal would have
to bend time somehow.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're traveling
from one point to another,

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.730 align:middle line:84%
there's a distance involved,
regardless of whether you're

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:90%
in a universe or not.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.920 align:middle line:84%
But these portals, either
they're magic, magical portals,

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:05.240 align:middle line:84%
or they bend the time so as you
go through, the time is bending

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.000 align:middle line:84%
and there probably is a
lot more, like I said,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.590 align:middle line:90%
to this that he didn't explain.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.350 align:middle line:84%
But they had this
other device, remember?

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: I said the four vector
longitudinal pathway device that

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.140 align:middle line:90%
we call it.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's not what
J-Rod called it,

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
that also was able
to somehow determine

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:84%
whether you are some kind
of a navigational system.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: But again, they
weren't near a planet.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle line:90%
They weren't near a star.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.440 align:middle line:84%
They were just in
a point in space.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's what
really scared them,

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:84%
because they expected to be in
a solar system or near a star

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.920 align:middle line:90%
or near a planet of the star.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Because they figured, OK,
we went through this portal,

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.440 align:middle line:84%
why did this portal exist
if it didn't propel him

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.390 align:middle line:84%
into a certain area that
they wanted to go to,

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.780 align:middle line:90%
like a planet or something?

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Sure.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.882 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: So they were really
concerned that this quantum

00:06:58.882 --> 00:07:01.340 align:middle line:84%
cord, however that worked, and
we still don't know how that

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:01.770 align:middle line:90%
worked--

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: --was going
to get them back.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle line:84%
So they stayed out
there some time.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.990 align:middle line:84%
There was no communications
at all, obviously, with Earth,

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.660 align:middle line:84%
because you're 40,000
years into the future.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.900 align:middle line:84%
So you can't call Earth on
a phone and say or radio

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:90%
and say, hey, we're out here.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Can you give us some help?

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.620 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: This is one thing
they also were trained

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.700 align:middle line:90%
in because they're on their own.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.620 align:middle line:84%
There's nobody out
there to help them.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.360 align:middle line:84%
They have to take care of
everything possible, the two

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.160 align:middle line:90%
astronauts.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.035 align:middle line:84%
At that time, there were
only two astronauts.

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Later, Cronus has
had more astronauts.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.820 align:middle line:84%
So they eventually stayed
out there some time,

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:44.710 align:middle line:84%
mapped the area that they were
in space, and then turned around

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:45.510 align:middle line:90%
and went back.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Used that quantum cord,
however, that worked.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:48.840 align:middle line:90%
I wish I knew.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.080 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could tell the
viewers how that worked.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.100 align:middle line:90%
And got back to the portal.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And when they got back to Earth,
all the measurements, however--

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
how they determined that, they
figured they went 40,000 years

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.970 align:middle line:90%
to the point and came back.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, can you imagine the first
question they'd asked J-Rod is,

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.640 align:middle line:84%
you sent us on this
highway to nowhere.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Right.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And there
was an explanation,

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what
that explanation was.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:90%
I wish I did.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.970 align:middle line:10%
Probably yeah, you went
there for something,

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.925 align:middle line:10%
some reason, which
I wish we knew.

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So there
was no planets.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.258 align:middle line:90%
There was not a meteor.

00:08:31.258 --> 00:08:33.390 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing to
gather once they got there.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.240 align:middle line:84%
It was more about
just the experience

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.800 align:middle line:84%
of going through the portal
and traveling in time.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Exactly.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.380 align:middle line:90%
That's the experience.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was like a test
or just an experiment maybe

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.990 align:middle line:90%
of the equipment.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And once the craft
came back, there

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.520 align:middle line:84%
were technicians
and scientists that

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.370 align:middle line:84%
immediately analyzed the craft
to see if there was any--

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.370 align:middle line:84%
what was the effects
on this craft

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.000 align:middle line:90%
from going through this portal.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.460 align:middle line:84%
But apparently,
there's no effects,

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.260 align:middle line:90%
doesn't damage anything.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.510 align:middle line:84%
There were some
problems with the food

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.300 align:middle line:84%
that they took with them,
how the pixelization

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:19.100 align:middle line:84%
of going through the portal
affected food in containers.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.780 align:middle line:84%
He didn't go into great details
on exactly how that worked,

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.600 align:middle line:84%
but obviously they
had enough food

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.510 align:middle line:84%
to nourish themselves
and make it back.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:32.210 align:middle line:84%
But that's the only
thing that affected that,

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.857 align:middle line:84%
that the scientists found that
affected the craft from going

00:09:35.857 --> 00:09:36.690 align:middle line:90%
through that portal.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So the food
was still edible?

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.240 align:middle line:90%
They got there, they could eat?

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.532 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: As far as I know, yes.

00:09:40.532 --> 00:09:43.047 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they had enough food
to eat and water to drink.

00:09:43.047 --> 00:09:45.380 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: I know they were
somewhere in space where there

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.650 align:middle line:84%
was no planets, but was there
anything they gleamed from like

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.772 align:middle line:84%
appearing 40,000 light
years in the future at all?

00:09:50.772 --> 00:09:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Did they observe anything
different or anything

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:53.940 align:middle line:90%
they could take back?

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: He said they were in
a point in space that was void

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.540 align:middle line:84%
of anything other than looking
out and seeing the other stars

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.440 align:middle line:84%
in the constellation
that they were in.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: OK, so nothing
super exciting yet?

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.770 align:middle line:90%
Just a test run?

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Exactly.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.420 align:middle line:10%
And it always
fascinates me to think

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.030 align:middle line:10%
about this, is why was this--

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:19.130 align:middle line:10%
why did J-Rod or why did
this skin of the craft

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.710 align:middle line:10%
select this particular portal?

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:27.355 align:middle line:10%
And why didn't they go
to a planet or in Earth

00:10:27.355 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:10%
into the future or
something like that?

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.355 align:middle line:84%
Which, of course,
they did later.

00:10:30.355 --> 00:10:33.560 align:middle line:90%
But this point in space--

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:84%
I think that's just me
thinking-- it's probably maybe

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:36.990 align:middle line:90%
it was a mistake.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they shouldn't
have gone through there.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Or now, this is something
that was brought up to me

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.610 align:middle line:90%
by a very brilliant scientist.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Not me, not Rick Doty,
I'm not a physicist.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:53.910 align:middle line:10%
He says, when we talked
about this privately,

00:10:53.910 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:10%
he said that portal might have
had different exit points.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: And this particular
craft chose the exit point that

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:10.070 align:middle line:84%
got them to this void in space,
rather than another exit point

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.090 align:middle line:84%
that would have got them into
a solar system where they could

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.410 align:middle line:84%
look at planets or
close to a star.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Now that could
very well be true.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.780 align:middle line:84%
That's another
explanation for why

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.380 align:middle line:84%
did they go in the
middle of nowhere.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.838 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So it was more about
our lack of navigation skills

00:11:27.838 --> 00:11:28.890 align:middle line:90%
yet in these portals?

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Exactly.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:34.460 align:middle line:84%
We got two astronaut humans
in an extraterrestrial craft

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.490 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrial
navigational systems

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.130 align:middle line:84%
and probably don't
fully understand

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:46.130 align:middle line:84%
that four vector longitudinal
pathway, maybe they just

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:47.340 align:middle line:90%
made a mistake.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Sounds very human.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Very human.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: The second mission,
where was the portal located

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:54.090 align:middle line:90%
that they went through?

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And what year did
this take place in?

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: The portal is near
Venus, and the year was 1988.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Great.

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:01.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Next mission was
on a newer Cronus craft.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.780 align:middle line:90%
They call it Cronus 2.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.190 align:middle line:84%
What they did was they
evaluated everything

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:14.930 align:middle line:84%
that was wrong with Cronus 1,
and they corrected everything

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:16.200 align:middle line:90%
in Cronus 2.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.760 align:middle line:90%
At least they thought they did.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.230 align:middle line:84%
They found different ways of
storing the food, the water,

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.912 align:middle line:84%
so during
pixelization, it didn't

00:12:24.912 --> 00:12:26.370 align:middle line:84%
affect it going
through the portal,

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't affect
the food or water.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:84%
They also found that the
seeding system was different,

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.800 align:middle line:90%
should be different.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.010 align:middle line:84%
The control panel,
they changed that.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:41.480 align:middle line:84%
They upgraded some other
environmental systems

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.190 align:middle line:84%
within the craft that would
alleviate some of the symptoms

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.410 align:middle line:84%
that the astronauts suffered
going through the portal.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.730 align:middle line:84%
But the suit, the helmet,
and the environment

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.310 align:middle line:84%
inside that craft
that they created

00:12:55.310 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:84%
helped alleviate some of those
problems with the pixelization.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.640 align:middle line:84%
But regardless of
what they did to try

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.980 align:middle line:84%
to alleviate some of
the symptoms of it,

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.820 align:middle line:90%
it didn't make it go away.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Every time you went
through that portal,

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.770 align:middle line:90%
you had that pixelization.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So you had to prepare those
astronauts in the future

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.250 align:middle line:84%
that the other astronauts
that were trained

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:23.882 align:middle line:84%
for that eventual pixelization
that's going to occur once they

00:13:23.882 --> 00:13:24.840 align:middle line:90%
go through that portal.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.230 align:middle line:90%
So they made changes.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:31.790 align:middle line:84%
The exterior of the craft
wasn't changed, to the best

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.170 align:middle line:90%
of my knowledge, just interior.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:37.380 align:middle line:84%
There were some
upgrades to the uniform,

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:44.040 align:middle line:84%
the suit that was worn by the
astronauts, and the helmets.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.840 align:middle line:90%
So there was an upgrade.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: So now they decide
to go on to another mission.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.380 align:middle line:90%
So they go onto a mission.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.280 align:middle line:84%
They go out in space,
they find this portal,

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.480 align:middle line:84%
they go through the portal
and they find themselves

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system 4,000
years into the future.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:04.920 align:middle line:90%
They see Earth.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.010 align:middle line:90%
They're not far from Earth.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And as they approach
Earth, the spacecraft

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.840 align:middle line:90%
was captured in a net.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.833 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: A net?

00:14:13.833 --> 00:14:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Some kind of a net.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.860 align:middle line:84%
He didn't explain
what the net was.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.930 align:middle line:84%
As the net was coming
down, apparently, Earth

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.470 align:middle line:84%
realized that this
craft was from our past

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.640 align:middle line:90%
and was able to dock it.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, what was Earth like
4,000 years in the future?

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, number one, it seems
to be defying gravity.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
built up in space,

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:42.300 align:middle line:84%
up around the sky, floating
cities, floating buildings,

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.460 align:middle line:90%
the spaceports were floating.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:49.680 align:middle line:84%
They communicated with Earth
but here's the problem.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Earth was talking English,
but there was so much

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.500 align:middle line:84%
terminology mixed in that the
astronauts didn't understand it.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.830 align:middle line:90%
And here's the reason.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And you think about this,
it only makes sense.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.470 align:middle line:84%
As our technology
advances, we have

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:middle line:84%
to create different
words and phrases.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And so 4,000 years
into the future,

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.030 align:middle line:84%
there's so much new technology
that these astronauts

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:20.900 align:middle line:84%
couldn't understand what these
Earthlings were talking about.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:90%
They interfaced with them.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:27.890 align:middle line:84%
They looked the same, although
they appeared all to be taller

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.125 align:middle line:90%
than humans in the 1980s.

00:15:31.125 --> 00:15:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Interesting.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: But they were taller.

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Every one of them were taller
and most of them lacked hair.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.225 align:middle line:90%
So you would fit right in.

00:15:40.225 --> 00:15:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: You beat
me to the joke.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: But they lacked
hair for some reason,

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know, that
wasn't explained to me.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:90%
But they did interface.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.740 align:middle line:84%
They spent time looking
at the new technology,

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.360 align:middle line:90%
looking at the planet.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.410 align:middle line:84%
The planet seemed to be the
same, although everything

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:01.040 align:middle line:84%
is built up in almost an
anti-gravity environment

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.580 align:middle line:90%
for some particular reason.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And again, a lot of this
wasn't explained to me,

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
but there are other
people that can explain.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's reasons
probably for that.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.440 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't actually
go on the planet.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.360 align:middle line:84%
They stayed in this
port, the space port.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:22.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that the Earthlings
4,000 years in the future,

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.920 align:middle line:84%
wanted to interface
with their people.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, I'm just guessing.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.240 align:middle line:84%
But they stayed there
for some time period.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.160 align:middle line:90%
They recorded everything.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And then they used a quantum
cord and they went back.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And when they got
back, everything

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.960 align:middle line:90%
was still there, recorded.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And then that was
all turned over

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.600 align:middle line:84%
to scientists, which
would analyze that.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.470 align:middle line:10%
And one of the interesting
things was when they listened,

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:53.150 align:middle line:10%
when the scientists listened to
the recordings of the Earthlings

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:58.770 align:middle line:10%
4,000 years in the future,
they realized that, wow,

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:04.650 align:middle line:10%
as the technology advances,
the language has to advance.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.920 align:middle line:84%
There's different words,
different phrases.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And so just look
into our time frame.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:16.269 align:middle line:84%
In my 70 years of being alive,
the language of technology

00:17:16.269 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:90%
has changed.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:22.520 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know what a computer
bit was in the 1960s or '70s.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.680 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know what a lot of
these computer technologies,

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.020 align:middle line:90%
or even space terms were then.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.240 align:middle line:10%
But if you think 4,000 years,
that's a heck of a long time

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.100 align:middle line:10%
period.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So everything, as the
technology changes--

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:84%
one of the things
that they were asking

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:45.780 align:middle line:84%
is why is everything in an
anti-gravity environment?

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.220 align:middle line:90%
And they explained it.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.100 align:middle line:84%
But every single
one of the words

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:53.610 align:middle line:84%
they were using to explain
it, we didn't understand it.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:58.322 align:middle line:84%
So my question, of course,
was did you get a dictionary?

00:17:58.322 --> 00:18:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Did you bring a
dictionary back with you?

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:00.863 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:00.863 --> 00:18:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: But he said,
no, I don't know.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
was thought of.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Oh that's another thing
that was interesting.

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:09.480 align:middle line:90%
I said did you--

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.760 align:middle line:84%
did they see a
computer or something?

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:19.070 align:middle line:84%
He said computers was all the
humans, the human's brains

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.440 align:middle line:84%
and functions almost
like a computer.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.940 align:middle line:84%
You didn't need a
device to look at.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, he didn't go into
great details on that,

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.200 align:middle line:84%
but I thought that
that's quite interesting.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Do human beings become
somewhat augmented?

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Transhumanism, meaning they
incorporated technology

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.572 align:middle line:90%
with the human being.

00:18:39.572 --> 00:18:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how they
would have done that.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:47.280 align:middle line:84%
But as I said, as our technology
advances thousands of years

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.920 align:middle line:84%
into the future,
a human has to be

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.190 align:middle line:84%
able to coexist with
the higher technology.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And somehow that happens,
whether it's transhumanism

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.670 align:middle line:90%
or how that actually happens.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So these humans were
humans that were just augmented,

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.720 align:middle line:84%
not synthetic beings with
a human consciousness?

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Right.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.353 align:middle line:90%
They were augmented.

00:19:07.353 --> 00:19:08.153 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:19:08.153 --> 00:19:09.340 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely right.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK, cool.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.850 align:middle line:84%
But I want to talk about
this planet for a second,

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.270 align:middle line:84%
because I have so
many questions.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.090 align:middle line:84%
The cities are floating in
the air, which is incredible,

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:17.710 align:middle line:90%
like Jetsons kind of lifestyle.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.270 align:middle line:90%
But was the environment OK?

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:21.495 align:middle line:84%
Was the Earth environment
like destroyed

00:19:21.495 --> 00:19:22.620 align:middle line:90%
and that's why they did it?

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Or did it look fine?

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:84%
They were just living
in the skies now.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: The question
I asked him was why--

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.740 align:middle line:84%
was there a reason why, did
they explain to you why?

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.370 align:middle line:84%
He said they did, but he
couldn't understand it.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:37.440 align:middle line:84%
But I said, did you
actually look at the ground?

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.130 align:middle line:84%
Did you look at how far
were you up the spaceports?

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Are they thousands of miles
up or are they close to Earth?

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.750 align:middle line:84%
He said they're probably
a thousand feet up or so.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.260 align:middle line:84%
They didn't measure,
I don't think.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the Earth, the
environment on the Earth,

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:59.060 align:middle line:84%
the land, the water, wherever
they were at looked normal.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there wasn't
any distortion

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:06.690 align:middle line:84%
because I thought kind of
catching what you were saying,

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:09.110 align:middle line:84%
maybe the Earth was
damaged to the point where

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't live on Earth,
so they had to live up here.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.900 align:middle line:84%
But there could
be some reason why

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.370 align:middle line:84%
the environment on the
ground couldn't support life,

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.120 align:middle line:84%
and that's why they
had to move everything

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.370 align:middle line:90%
in the anti-gravity environment.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe something
occurred on Earth

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:84%
that these cities had to be up
in an anti-gravity environment.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:39.500 align:middle line:84%
But that's just so
incredible to think about how

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.430 align:middle line:90%
humans could live like that.

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:45.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he said they saw
crafts, like vehicles

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.340 align:middle line:84%
that were flying around almost
like the Jetsons, he said,

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:90%
kind of like the Jetsons.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.123 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Were they primarily
living in these cities up above?

00:20:54.123 --> 00:20:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Or was there people
living on the ground

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.248 align:middle line:84%
and in the cities and they're
kind of going back and forth?

00:20:58.248 --> 00:21:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: As I understand him
explaining that there were

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.620 align:middle line:84%
humans still living on
the planet's surface.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:11.210 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason, the cities,
at least the ones that they saw,

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:14.300 align:middle line:84%
were floating above
the ground level

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:90%
for some particular reason.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And again, that wasn't
fully explained.

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they
couldn't understand.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:24.860 align:middle line:10%
Like I said earlier, the
explanation for why the cities

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.780 align:middle line:10%
were up there, they couldn't
understand it because the word,

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.750 align:middle line:10%
the language that was
being used, the technology,

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:35.510 align:middle line:10%
the explanation, you're
trying to explain the workings

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:39.275 align:middle line:10%
of a complicated jet engine
to somebody from the 1600s.

00:21:39.275 --> 00:21:41.400 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't understand
what you're talking about,

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.120 align:middle line:84%
even though you were speaking
the same language, English

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.310 align:middle line:84%
or French or whatever
you're speaking.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:51.720 align:middle line:84%
So there's obviously, even
though English was being spoken,

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:84%
the terminology and the
words being used 4,000 years

00:21:56.210 --> 00:22:01.240 align:middle line:84%
in the future isn't being
understood by the 20th century

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.040 align:middle line:90%
man.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the
questions I asked him,

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.900 align:middle line:84%
was there any hostilities
towards the astronauts?

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.210 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:10.250 align:middle line:90%
There was no hostilities.

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:12.420 align:middle line:90%
They recognized them as humans.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:17.280 align:middle line:84%
They recognized the astronauts,
as being from the past.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And they had as many
questions to the astronauts

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.170 align:middle line:90%
as the astronauts had to them.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, wow.

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Because they're
4,000 years into the future,

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.890 align:middle line:84%
they don't know
where these people--

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.840 align:middle line:90%
what year did you come from?

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I would have
asked if I was 4,000 years--

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.970 align:middle line:84%
what year did you
leave to get here?

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And then the question is, what
portal did you come through?

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Or was it highway
number 16 or whatever.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.590 align:middle line:84%
However, they made
all those questions

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I wish I would have
asked, but I didn't ask.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:23:00.860 align:middle line:84%
So the complexity of this is
that these astronauts from

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:09.410 align:middle line:84%
the 20th century are flying into
space and docking with Earth

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:12.320 align:middle line:90%
4,000 years into the future.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:17.600 align:middle line:84%
There's 1,000 different things
that we should have asked

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:84%
or they should have asked that
would have explained a lot

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.550 align:middle line:90%
of things to us.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:28.790 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, what I'm
telling you is what he told me.

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: OK, so is there any
other interactions or anything

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.390 align:middle line:84%
important you'd like to
share about this event?

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Yeah, very
important part.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:41.750 align:middle line:84%
During the interaction with
the Earthlings from the future,

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:46.670 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to examine
the humans from the past,

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and they had a scanner that
the humans stood in front of

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.580 align:middle line:84%
and there was a light
that went over their body.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And probably similar to an MRI
or a really advanced MRI or CAT

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:03.470 align:middle line:90%
scan.

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:06.360 align:middle line:84%
But it took only a
few seconds to do,

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and they had the full picture
of that human, everything

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:12.180 align:middle line:90%
about that human.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And they were very interested
about the circulatory system

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and the lung capacity of
the humans from the past.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Because apparently,
although he didn't say,

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:84%
go into any great
details about it,

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.790 align:middle line:84%
but apparently the
humans into the future

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:36.120 align:middle line:84%
had different body structures,
or their lungs were different,

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.800 align:middle line:84%
their circulatory
system was different.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you consider that maybe
those humans in the future,

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:47.960 align:middle line:84%
as we were saying earlier, were
part robotic or something else,

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.290 align:middle line:84%
that's probably why they
were interested to see

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:52.670 align:middle line:90%
how they evolved.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Earthlings in the future are
probably more interested in how

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:84%
they evolved to where they are
at, because they didn't have

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.480 align:middle line:84%
a chance to look at somebody
4,000 years into the past.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's
fascinating to think of that,

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:12.140 align:middle line:84%
that they were as
interested in the astronauts

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.810 align:middle line:84%
as the astronauts were
interested in them.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing I want to say
about this was the astronauts

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:22.310 align:middle line:84%
wanted to take something
back with them.

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:26.250 align:middle line:84%
So they gave them a device
that looked like a tablet.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:30.950 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is they
gave him this device that

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.600 align:middle line:84%
looked like a
tablet, and he said

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.010 align:middle line:84%
it almost looked like one
of those Kindle devices

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:37.670 align:middle line:84%
you would buy a kid that
you could play games on it.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:39.900 align:middle line:84%
But there wasn't
anything on the screen.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.200 align:middle line:84%
But they gave it to
them, but the problem

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.190 align:middle line:84%
is they didn't
explain how it worked.

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.150 align:middle line:90%
So they brought that back.

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:51.025 align:middle line:84%
Now, scientists took-- when
they brought it back and gave it

00:25:51.025 --> 00:25:52.400 align:middle line:84%
to the scientists
and say, here's

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.350 align:middle line:84%
what we brought from the
future, they're saying, well,

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:56.430 align:middle line:90%
how does it work?

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not,
it was in 1988.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:01.610 align:middle line:90%
It took till 1996.

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, eight years, to
figure out this thing

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.310 align:middle line:90%
worked through consciousness.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Of course.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: You had to use
consciousness to turn it on.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness played
or brought up things.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.760 align:middle line:84%
But it took them eight
years to figure that out.

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's just an example of how
their technology had advanced

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.900 align:middle line:84%
4,000 years, and ours, we
couldn't figure out how to turn

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:26.700 align:middle line:90%
the thing on.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: Right, like
how we charge it,

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.990 align:middle line:84%
how do we turn it on,
what even is this thing?

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:34.940 align:middle line:10%
>> DOTY: Really, one of the
most important things that they

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:39.050 align:middle line:10%
learned after they got back and
recorded everything was that

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:43.940 align:middle line:10%
these Earthlings, from
4,000 years into the future,

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.650 align:middle line:10%
has made the journey
back to Earth.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:48.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: They have
traveled back in time.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- that wasn't
explained, but they came back.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:00.140 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things that they said

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:03.950 align:middle line:84%
that was recorded that
the scientists figured out

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:07.800 align:middle line:84%
was that they come
back to look at Earth,

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.920 align:middle line:84%
but they could not touch
or change anything.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: And they never did.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>> JOSH: So I shouldn't be
suspicious of all the tall,

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:16.170 align:middle line:90%
bald people on the planet?

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:17.640 align:middle line:90%
Like they didn't come down here.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.720 align:middle line:90%
They're just observing us from.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.520 align:middle line:90%
From above.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: But think about it.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:26.120 align:middle line:84%
If we had the technology 4,000
years into the future to come

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:31.260 align:middle line:84%
back to Earth, 10,000 years in
the future probably can do it.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.400 align:middle line:84%
100,000 years in the future,
we could come back and do it.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So what we're seeing in some
of the phenomena of UFOs,

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:46.440 align:middle line:84%
could it be us from
the future coming back?

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's always
a question that's

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:53.510 align:middle line:84%
been asked at almost every
single UFO convention.

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Or these UFO researchers
saying a lot of these things

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:04.050 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing are
really us from the future.

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:07.380 align:middle line:90%
And I never connected the two.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just didn't
think about that.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.400 align:middle line:84%
But the crafts are different
because in the future

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.400 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to be the
same as our crafts, spacecrafts.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.900 align:middle line:84%
So we see something
in the sky that's

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:25.250 align:middle line:84%
flying that we can't
identify, maybe

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:26.520 align:middle line:90%
it is something in the future.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.930 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that they specifically

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:32.990 align:middle line:84%
told the astronauts,
and they figured it out

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:36.170 align:middle line:84%
later in the recordings,
is that we went back

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.390 align:middle line:84%
to observe, we never
changed anything.

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:41.310 align:middle line:90%
We didn't alter anything.

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:47.520 align:middle line:84%
We went back, we observed, and
then came back to the future.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's a theory out there,
the paradox theory, of course,

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:54.500 align:middle line:90%
is that if you go back in time--

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.710 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to
really go too deep in this

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:00.200 align:middle line:84%
because that's for
another subject--

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:04.860 align:middle line:84%
there are people out there that
claim that you go back in time,

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:06.770 align:middle line:90%
you're in a bubble.

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:08.100 align:middle line:90%
You can't change anything.

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.250 align:middle line:84%
You can go back to observe, but
you can never change anything.

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Like you can't go back
and kill your grandfather

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.050 align:middle line:84%
or your great grandfather
or something like that.

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:19.580 align:middle line:84%
There's some particular
paradox for that.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the same thing

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.670 align:middle line:84%
that they were trying to
explain to us, was we come back

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:26.790 align:middle line:90%
and observe you.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:28.332 align:middle line:10%
We want to go back
and see what Earth

00:29:28.332 --> 00:29:33.440 align:middle line:10%
was in 1980 or
whatever, 1988 or 1990,

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.163 align:middle line:10%
but we're not going
to disturb anything.

00:29:35.163 --> 00:29:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: So we can see them.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:39.390 align:middle line:84%
They can see us, but they can't
really affect our reality today?

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>> DOTY: Exactly.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSH: OK.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.930 align:middle line:84%
We have Cronus 1,
we have Cronus 2,

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:46.130 align:middle line:84%
were there future versions
of the Cronus craft?

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>> DOTY: Josh, that's
for another episode.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.010 align:middle line:84%
