>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.030 align:middle line:10%
we are with Colonel Randy
Cramer, who has participated

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.940 align:middle line:10%
in a covert military space
program called the Earth Defense

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.740 align:middle line:10%
Force.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.130 align:middle line:10%
Today, we are talking
about ET public landings.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.258 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.258 --> 00:00:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY CRAMER:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So there's been
some aerial phenomenon that's

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.410 align:middle line:90%
been in the news and the media.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.360 align:middle line:90%
How authentic is this?

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Or do you have another
example why it may not be?

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The stories
that I've seen

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.920 align:middle line:84%
hit the public airwaves
seem to be completely

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.190 align:middle line:90%
authentic and legitimate.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.460 align:middle line:84%
The information that we
get through special section

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.220 align:middle line:84%
intelligence confirms
that as well as

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:84%
what we understand to be
dozens of unreported incidences

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.750 align:middle line:84%
that are also
occurring globally.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Which ones stick
out for you recently

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.650 align:middle line:90%
that you would like to discuss?

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, I mean, the
Las Vegas one, I think,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.850 align:middle line:84%
is one that stuck out the most,
had probably some of the best

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.670 align:middle line:90%
evidence.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.540 align:middle line:10%
And then the Miami one was--

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there's the
circumstantial evidence

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.250 align:middle line:10%
around that one,
I think, is deeply

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.830 align:middle line:10%
indicative of an occurrence
that was actually occurring even

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.620 align:middle line:10%
though they seem to have nabbed
most of the legitimate evidence

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.420 align:middle line:10%
for that.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.837 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So from
your perspective,

00:01:21.837 --> 00:01:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Randy, what actually
happened in Las Vegas?

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: From the witness
testimony of the folks that

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.410 align:middle line:84%
lived in the house, the family
members that lived in the house

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:84%
that apparently this vehicle
landed in the backyard, which,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.790 align:middle line:84%
from the aerial photos
that I've seen, "backyard"

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.900 align:middle line:84%
is not a very good
descriptive term.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.290 align:middle line:84%
It was really a gravel lot
where they kept heavy machinery,

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.810 align:middle line:84%
like road equipment, garden
equipment, and something

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.305 align:middle line:84%
like that for their
home business.

00:01:51.305 --> 00:01:53.180 align:middle line:84%
It looked like at least
a quarter of an acre.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a big lot with
a chain link fence around it.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And then there ended
up being a big ring

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.210 align:middle line:84%
right in the middle
of the gravel,

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.220 align:middle line:84%
where this thing set
down right in the middle,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:90%
made a big circular pattern.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.570 align:middle line:84%
So according to the
eyewitnesses who lived there,

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:84%
this thing drops down
in their backyard.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.750 align:middle line:90%
They all come out to look at it.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:84%
They're observing multiple ETs
that come out of the vehicle.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Some came right up
to the house, which

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.022 align:middle line:84%
we presume if your
car broke down

00:02:23.022 --> 00:02:25.355 align:middle line:84%
and you might go up to someone's
house and try to knock,

00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I think they were just trying
to be polite and just say, hey,

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.120 align:middle line:84%
sorry, we crashed
in your backyard,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.890 align:middle line:84%
we shouldn't be here
more than a minute,

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.660 align:middle line:84%
while they had to
make some repairs,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.725 align:middle line:84%
apparently before they
could take off again.

00:02:35.725 --> 00:02:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you see them?

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I mean, inside.

00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>> What'd you see?

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>> It was like a--

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:90%
it was like a big creature.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.253 align:middle line:90%
>> A big creature?

00:02:43.253 --> 00:02:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, like
around 10 feet tall.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not going to BS you guys.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.920 align:middle line:84%
One of my partners said they saw
something fall out of the sky,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.577 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I'm
kind of curious.

00:02:49.577 --> 00:02:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Did you see anything
land in your backyard?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>> They see a big
bubble, they say.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:84%
They see a big
something with light.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The eyewitnesses'
report seeing this whole

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.170 align:middle line:90%
incident through a haze--

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.850 align:middle line:84%
through a fuzzy haze,
which, according

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.060 align:middle line:84%
to what we understand about the
physics, the electrogravitics

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.870 align:middle line:84%
from the vehicle itself that
creates the anti-gravity effect,

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.670 align:middle line:90%
does that.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:90%
It bends the light.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.370 align:middle line:84%
It makes this fuzzy sort
of white light effect.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.310 align:middle line:90%
So that checks actually.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.395 align:middle line:84%
If a vehicle was to
land in your backyard--

00:03:23.395 --> 00:03:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Makes sense.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.728 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: --and
you were like, hey,

00:03:25.728 --> 00:03:28.410 align:middle line:84%
there were kind of hazy
and fuzzy, that checks.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:84%
That's an effect of
the light bending.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, it actually sort of
self-illuminates the space

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.920 align:middle line:90%
around the vehicle.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a lit
up corona that's

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.620 align:middle line:90%
not coming from a light bulb.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's coming from the
fuselage of the vehicle itself.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.800 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it creates all of
that weird visual effect.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I totally
agree with you with that.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:90%
They also hired a corporation.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it was one of
the news companies out there--

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.560 align:middle line:84%
one of the major news three
letter agency companies

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.360 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And there was some
film, of course,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.150 align:middle line:84%
of the creatures that
were also shifting

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.420 align:middle line:90%
in and out of this blur zone.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yes.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.510 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: And you
attribute that to the--

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.310 align:middle line:10%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Or is that maybe
something separate on them,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.420 align:middle line:84%
like a piece of-- because
we've used technical equipment

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.800 align:middle line:84%
like that in the projects,
like kind of a predator suit

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.600 align:middle line:90%
kind of thing.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.829 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.720 align:middle line:84%
I would say the
most obvious thing

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.480 align:middle line:84%
that you could pick from
that is there's definitely

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.900 align:middle line:84%
an effect of physics of
light that is occurring

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.680 align:middle line:90%
from the fuselage itself.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.780 align:middle line:84%
However, it is also
certainly possible,

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.570 align:middle line:84%
depending on what their
natural frequency--

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.860 align:middle line:84%
their natural
density frequency is,

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.450 align:middle line:84%
would depend on whether it was
taking them some effort to be

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.950 align:middle line:90%
fully present in 3D space.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And if that was the case,
then you might see them kind

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.270 align:middle line:84%
of shifting in and out a little
bit because they might not fully

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.200 align:middle line:90%
be in a 3D space.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.600 align:middle line:84%
They may have, as we
say, one foot in 3D,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.880 align:middle line:90%
one foot in 4D at the same time.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's entirely possible that
there's a crossing over effect

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.310 align:middle line:84%
that, again, visually
would look like someone

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.310 align:middle line:84%
was maybe a little
bendy or a little flowy

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.170 align:middle line:84%
or coming in a
little out of space.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.520 align:middle line:84%
It would essentially not look as
sharp and clear as my arm looks

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.620 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What else
could we add to that?

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:10%
>>CRAMER: Well, I
mean, what we know just

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:10%
from the protocols of such
events and how they occur,

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.998 align:middle line:10%
we know that the
green plasma ejection

00:05:29.998 --> 00:05:31.540 align:middle line:10%
that was occurring
around the vehicle

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.210 align:middle line:10%
that that is the signal of a
vehicle making an emergency

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:10%
landing.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.780 align:middle line:10%
So any time you see a
craft that's coming down

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.500 align:middle line:10%
and it's surrounded by this
green plasma, that is literally

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.360 align:middle line:10%
it flashing its
light, saying we're

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.485 align:middle line:10%
coming in for an emergency.

00:05:45.485 --> 00:05:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Like a
protection field maybe?

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: It's a signal.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: A signal.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: It's a signal.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.580 align:middle line:90%
It's flashing lights.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.770 align:middle line:84%
It's saying, emergency
landing, emergency landing,

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:53.760 align:middle line:90%
emergency landing.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.220 align:middle line:10%
Anybody who can see it know
that that's what's occurring.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.770 align:middle line:10%
So it's incredibly obvious to
whatever space traffic control

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.230 align:middle line:10%
would be operating in that
area that they can see, oh,

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.940 align:middle line:10%
that's a vehicle making
an emergency landing.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.710 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have to presume
that something else is

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.510 align:middle line:90%
occurring.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.710 align:middle line:84%
It's an intergalactic
universal signal

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.940 align:middle line:90%
for making an emergency landing.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm glad
you bring this up,

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Randy, because there's so much
pop culture media out there

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.770 align:middle line:90%
saying, oh, they crash landed.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.790 align:middle line:90%
And there's injuries.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And this was a controlled
emergency landing.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.160 align:middle line:90%
Would you agree?

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.535 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:06:27.535 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
The vehicle was
intact when it landed.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.750 align:middle line:84%
They had to make some
repairs, for the same reason

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.150 align:middle line:84%
that you might have
to pull your car over

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.300 align:middle line:84%
to make a repair that you can't
repair your engine while it's

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.450 align:middle line:90%
running down the road.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.860 align:middle line:90%
So you need to pull over.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So they needed to land, where
they could turn everything

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.380 align:middle line:84%
off and then make the repair
that they needed to repair.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And then within minutes,
they were out of there.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.420 align:middle line:84%
If it had crashed, it would have
crashed and made an explosion.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.503 align:middle line:84%
And there would have
been orange fire.

00:06:55.503 --> 00:06:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And it would have been
a whole other incident.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.502 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, I was privy
to some of the videos that

00:07:00.502 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:90%
were not shown in the public.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.395 align:middle line:90%
But even the videos that are--

00:07:03.395 --> 00:07:05.395 align:middle line:84%
And you've seen some of
these videos, of course.

00:07:05.395 --> 00:07:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, yeah.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you
think-- my opinion,

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.590 align:middle line:84%
what do you think they were
doing when they went over

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.185 align:middle line:84%
the fence, grabbed some water,
brought it back to the craft?

00:07:12.185 --> 00:07:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you think they were trying to
fix the craft with this water?

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Because they did end up
tracking that going to Lake Mead

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.950 align:middle line:90%
afterwards and submerging.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not knowing
exactly what kind

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.510 align:middle line:84%
of mechanical problems that
they were having, they could

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.180 align:middle line:84%
have easily needed some
water as a coolant.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.920 align:middle line:90%
Or they could have needed to--

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.400 align:middle line:84%
maybe they had a small
localized fire on the dashboard

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.583 align:middle line:90%
that they needed to put out or--

00:07:36.583 --> 00:07:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because water is
a power source in its own.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It also
could be used in the--

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.537 align:middle line:84%
if it's part of
their fuel source,

00:07:42.537 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:84%
if they're using
some kind of hydrogen

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.990 align:middle line:84%
cracking system or using
the deuterium in the water

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.332 align:middle line:84%
or something, that's
also entirely possible.

00:07:50.332 --> 00:07:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And where would
you fit these species?

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.550 align:middle line:84%
I know through what
you've been through,

00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:84%
you have a different form of
how you rate species, I'll say,

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.500 align:middle line:90%
based on their races.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sure.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And also as far as
different types of program life

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.150 align:middle line:84%
forms, what would
you call these?

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: From the picture that
I saw that was taken from one

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:15.180 align:middle line:84%
of the ring cameras, they had
a brown speckled skin tone,

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:20.620 align:middle line:84%
which as far as I understand,
identifies them as a Zeta 3C.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what does a
Zeta 3C usually look like?

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Again,
they're not 4 footers.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.710 align:middle line:84%
They're more like
5 to 6, 6 and 1/2.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.970 align:middle line:84%
They can be like our
height, normal height.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.730 align:middle line:84%
But their skin
tone, again, is not

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:84%
a lot of that pasty,
gray, white color.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.840 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a brown
speckled color.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.223 align:middle line:84%
So they have little black
spots on a brown skin tone.

00:08:42.223 --> 00:08:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, the
boy on the video

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.770 align:middle line:84%
was saying that these were
incredibly tall beings.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: My understanding
of most of the Zeta species

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:54.350 align:middle line:84%
is they usually have a worker
class or a worker caste, which

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.640 align:middle line:84%
is a little shorter, and a
leader class or an officer

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.480 align:middle line:90%
class, which is taller.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.650 align:middle line:84%
So there can be a couple
of feet difference

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:84%
in height between a worker,
a pilot, and a captain

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.643 align:middle line:90%
or an officer.

00:09:10.643 --> 00:09:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So according to
the Marine Special section,

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.360 align:middle line:90%
what did they observe?

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.920 align:middle line:90%
And what came out of this?

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, again, from
what we understand, the vehicle,

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.675 align:middle line:90%
which is a small probably--

00:09:22.675 --> 00:09:24.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wouldn't even
call it a scout ship.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.740 align:middle line:84%
It was probably a
lifeboat type ship.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: It was very small.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.410 align:middle line:84%
But it was also too small
for all of the passengers

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.890 align:middle line:90%
to fit inside.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:40.530 align:middle line:84%
So that is an indication that
it's got some pocket dimension

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.690 align:middle line:84%
variation, that it was
bigger on the inside

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:47.610 align:middle line:84%
than the outside because
the number of pilots or--

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Like a clown
car, there's all these--

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.660 align:middle line:84%
people are coming out of
this small little area.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.535 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:52.535 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it wasn't much bigger
than an automobile as far as

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.180 align:middle line:90%
like front to back.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:03.150 align:middle line:84%
But you've got several very
tall and bigger sized passengers

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.730 align:middle line:84%
that came out of it that would
indicate that either they

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.640 align:middle line:84%
were crammed in there
shoulder to shoulder

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.130 align:middle line:84%
or it was bigger on the
inside than it appeared

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.060 align:middle line:84%
to be on the outside,
which is a thing.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So that could
totally be the case.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Randy, we spoke
about this on other episodes.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And let's explain to the
viewers, how would you do this--

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:90%
how would you explain--

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.610 align:middle line:84%
size doesn't matter in the
universe and space travel

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.390 align:middle line:84%
because it could be
the size of a pea,

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.450 align:middle line:90%
you have a whole civilization.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.780 align:middle line:84%
What's the dynamics
of a craft that

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:84%
may look like it's only
10 feet in diameter

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.100 align:middle line:84%
but inside it's the size
of a football field?

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: A pocket
dimension, basically.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Pocket dimension, OK.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.805 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: So we call
that a pocket dimension.

00:10:41.805 --> 00:10:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So basically, if I had a
pocket dimension in my pocket

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:50.050 align:middle line:84%
that was bigger than
my actual pocket,

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I could store a whole
library of books

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:58.360 align:middle line:84%
or every utensil and
item in my kitchen

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.660 align:middle line:84%
way more than what actually
fit in a little three

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.740 align:middle line:84%
by three pocket because
inside is a much bigger pocket

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.040 align:middle line:90%
dimension space.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they,
obviously, this race,

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.530 align:middle line:84%
has mastered this pocket
dimension technology.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It's a fairly
common technology, actually.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, it
would be one that they

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.800 align:middle line:90%
had mastered or developed.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's very common among
intergalactic species

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:22.908 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do that.

00:11:22.908 --> 00:11:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can you explain
how they did that?

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And have you used it on
any of your missions?

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I mean,
I've been in ships

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:32.140 align:middle line:84%
that have that
technological ability

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.940 align:middle line:84%
so that from the outside,
it appears one side.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.330 align:middle line:84%
But then as soon as you step
inside, it's much, much larger.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So I've certainly
been in vehicles.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And I've been in
ships that do that.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:45.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not entirely
sure other than--

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.330 align:middle line:84%
the way it's been
explained to me,

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:52.490 align:middle line:84%
if I had a balloon that
was uninflated in my hand

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:58.160 align:middle line:84%
and I blew it up, that the
amount of cubic space that's

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:84%
inside that balloon could then
be squeezed into something

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.220 align:middle line:90%
that's much smaller.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.670 align:middle line:84%
But then when you
went inside the ship

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.170 align:middle line:84%
that you put that
pocket dimension inside,

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.030 align:middle line:90%
now you're inside the balloon.

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And so the balloon is
as big and as spacious

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.740 align:middle line:84%
as you inflated
the balloon to be.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.830 align:middle line:84%
But even if you packed
that and stuck it

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.790 align:middle line:84%
into something that
was much smaller,

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:26.410 align:middle line:84%
the internal space maintains
the exact same square footage,

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.520 align:middle line:84%
square meters, cubic
feet, or whatever.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they're decreasing
that mass atomically somehow.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.160 align:middle line:90%
So it all can fit into a space.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Is it more of a portal type
thing, where you're actually

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.370 align:middle line:84%
accessing a different part
somewhere else in the universe

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.410 align:middle line:90%
that you store all your stuff?

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:46.730 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The surface
area on the outside

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.970 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have to equal the
surface area on the inside.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.200 align:middle line:84%
So you can put something
into a much smaller space

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.390 align:middle line:84%
so that the surface area
on the outside of it

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:03.090 align:middle line:84%
is less than the surface
area on the inside.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Physics wise, the surface
area on the inside

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:10.940 align:middle line:84%
maintains a constant no matter
what size of a container

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.060 align:middle line:90%
you stick it into.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, that has
been definitely proven

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.500 align:middle line:84%
in many different
crash recovery sites,

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.800 align:middle line:84%
even in Roswell, where
the craft was smaller.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But inside, it was much
greater dimensions.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.193 align:middle line:84%
So I can see how
that could happen.

00:13:24.193 --> 00:13:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, again,
it's very common.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.568 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What other
conclusions could you

00:13:27.568 --> 00:13:32.420 align:middle line:84%
share with us about this
Las Vegas emergency landing?

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And you can also express
your opinions on it as well.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Again, as
near as we understand,

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.970 align:middle line:84%
they had to make an
emergency landing,

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:43.540 align:middle line:84%
made the emergency landing, had
to make repairs of some kind,

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.020 align:middle line:84%
made those repairs,
took off again.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And then where it
gets a little strange

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.100 align:middle line:84%
is they then disappeared
into the lake.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.740 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean
that they stayed there.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.440 align:middle line:84%
They could have gone
somewhere else from there.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Or if there was a
portal in the lake

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.810 align:middle line:84%
or they used one in the lake
and went somewhere else,

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:09.150 align:middle line:84%
then it wouldn't have actually
been inside the lake, which

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.398 align:middle line:90%
they sent some vehicles.

00:14:10.398 --> 00:14:12.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were
military vehicles there.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:13.180 align:middle line:90%
They did a full search.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:90%
They didn't find anything.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:19.710 align:middle line:84%
But wherever it went from
there, which we suspect

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.760 align:middle line:84%
was to a spaceport facility
where they could then

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.920 align:middle line:90%
be processed as refugees.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Fascinating.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Indian Hills,
I think, is probably

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.480 align:middle line:90%
where the facility is.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.250 align:middle line:84%
The intergalactic spaceport
there is an Indian Hills.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.290 align:middle line:84%
That's probably there
where they were taken to

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:84%
or went to immediately
after that.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And then were
processed as refugees

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:41.910 align:middle line:90%
so they could be sent back home.

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But what's interesting
is all those lakes out

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.660 align:middle line:84%
there are connected
in one way or another.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
lakes out there,

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.510 align:middle line:84%
like Lake Las Vegas, that
do record certain depths.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:56.220 align:middle line:84%
But from what I'm hearing
through the organizations out

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.260 align:middle line:84%
there, that there are depths
that are uncharted there,

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260 align:middle line:84%
that they cannot get a
depth from these areas.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting
that maybe this is also

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:06.630 align:middle line:84%
tied into these wells
and aquifers, where

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.370 align:middle line:84%
we get the water
from these reservoirs

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.890 align:middle line:84%
anyway that might be
connected to this place

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.908 align:middle line:84%
that you talked about,
this refugee camp area.

00:15:13.908 --> 00:15:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, and
we certainly know

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:19.950 align:middle line:84%
that there are entry
places to spaceports

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:24.970 align:middle line:84%
that can be through solid
rock, that can be underwater.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:84%
They're incredibly
unconventional

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.432 align:middle line:84%
by our own standards
of where you

00:15:30.432 --> 00:15:32.140 align:middle line:84%
think you would need
to access something,

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.620 align:middle line:84%
that you would need a
hangar door to open.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Or you would need something
to make way for the vehicle

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:84%
to be able to land,
which, in many cases,

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.530 align:middle line:84%
the sophistication is that's
completely not required at all.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.350 align:middle line:84%
They can go straight
through solid rock.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:47.712 align:middle line:90%
Or they're underwater.

00:15:47.712 --> 00:15:49.420 align:middle line:84%
They can go straight
down into the water.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.410 align:middle line:84%
There are sometimes
portals, caverns, tunnels,

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:55.150 align:middle line:84%
and things in many of
the lakes and so forth.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you believe
we had any interaction?

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Or was the cause of
this emergency landing

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.050 align:middle line:84%
such as our corporations,
military, government, so forth?

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It's
difficult to speculate.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:10.770 align:middle line:84%
We would presume from
the increase in activity

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.530 align:middle line:84%
in emergency landings
that it has something

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:20.480 align:middle line:84%
to do with increased volatile
activity in the system, where

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.980 align:middle line:84%
we think that many
of these vehicles

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.570 align:middle line:84%
are being forced to land
not necessarily because they

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:29.250 align:middle line:84%
wanted to or just had a
minor mechanical problem.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:34.400 align:middle line:84%
But there seems to be something
volatile, which is either

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.830 align:middle line:84%
forcing them down into our
airspace or potentially even

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.580 align:middle line:84%
damaging crafts so
that they have to,

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.210 align:middle line:84%
again, take off in
a little dinghy--

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:50.540 align:middle line:84%
an escape pod and escape ship
from a ship that was probably

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:51.990 align:middle line:90%
much larger originally.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.657 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What would
you tell our viewers

00:16:53.657 --> 00:16:59.390 align:middle line:84%
that say, well, these
beings are obviously so far

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:02.240 align:middle line:84%
ahead in science
and everything else,

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.040 align:middle line:84%
how could they
have a malfunction?

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, I
mean, because even

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.329 align:middle line:84%
with amazing,
sophisticated technologies,

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:13.079 align:middle line:84%
there's no such thing as
100% perfect all the time.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:17.369 align:middle line:84%
But again, if there's
volatile activity,

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:20.099 align:middle line:84%
you hit something hard
enough or you hit it

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:23.200 align:middle line:84%
with a wave or a pulse
or an EMP or anything,

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.650 align:middle line:84%
you can damage these
equipment, causing them, again,

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.190 align:middle line:84%
to be forced to make a landing
and have to make repairs

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.940 align:middle line:90%
before they can move on.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you believe any
of the extraterrestrials

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.100 align:middle line:84%
in this craft were
injured during this event?

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It doesn't
appear that they were.

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.230 align:middle line:84%
They didn't appear to be--
from all of the footage

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.150 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen,
none of them appeared

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:84%
to be injured, have broken
bones, be limping or bleeding.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.490 align:middle line:84%
So they appear to
be fully intact.

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: If this was
a forced landing,

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.760 align:middle line:84%
why didn't the United States
send their arsenal of planes

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.178 align:middle line:90%
and helicopters and jets?

00:17:56.178 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The footage
I've seen shows

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.530 align:middle line:84%
that they did about 20
minutes after the vehicle left

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:02.410 align:middle line:90%
the landing site.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Again, it was about
20, 30 minutes after.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And that's
late for them?

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, that is
very late, especially

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.950 align:middle line:84%
as close by as they
are there in Vegas.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:11.400 align:middle line:84%
But for whatever reason, it
seemed to take them about 20,

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.330 align:middle line:84%
30 minutes after
that to show up.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:14.860 align:middle line:90%
But there were aircrafts.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:15.720 align:middle line:90%
There were jets.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And there was a large
contingent of ground vehicles

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.850 align:middle line:90%
that appeared near Lake Mead.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, right, yes.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:22.990 align:middle line:90%
So they did show up.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.390 align:middle line:84%
But it appeared to be about
20 or 30 minutes late,

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:26.580 align:middle line:90%
which is interesting.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you aware
of any air traffic

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:31.570 align:middle line:84%
control or radar or sonar or
anything that picked that up?

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: I'm sure that it was.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.440 align:middle line:90%
It was not a stealth landing.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.280 align:middle line:84%
The vehicle did not have
its "stealth equipment"

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.140 align:middle line:84%
turned on so that it was not
trying to hide from radar.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.680 align:middle line:84%
So I imagine that whoever
was looking at the radar

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.040 align:middle line:90%
saw radar tracings.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.398 align:middle line:84%
We certainly have satellite
radar that we tracked it with.

00:18:50.398 --> 00:18:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: For the
viewers who have not

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.170 align:middle line:84%
heard about the
Miami Bay Mall event,

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.320 align:middle line:90%
let's start from the beginning.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.620 align:middle line:90%
What started over there?

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: So January
1, 2024, there

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:02.860 align:middle line:84%
was an incident that
occurred at the Miami Bayside

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Mall in which, we'll say, the
credible eyewitnesses reported

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:11.830 align:middle line:84%
seeing three large, tall
extraterrestrials that

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:16.450 align:middle line:84%
were eight, nine feet tall that
seem to emerge from a clothing

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:20.860 align:middle line:84%
store in this mall, which
send the entire population

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:25.630 align:middle line:84%
of the mall panicking, running,
screaming out of the mall.

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:31.480 align:middle line:84%
The duty officer on charge
with Miami Police Department

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:36.100 align:middle line:84%
called up every single police
officer on duty and car

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:42.520 align:middle line:84%
in Miami at the time, which was
like 123 cars and cops, which,

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.610 align:middle line:84%
let's just be very clear,
that goes completely

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.780 align:middle line:84%
against all known law
enforcement protocols.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.700 align:middle line:84%
As you don't call every
cop you have on duty

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:59.000 align:middle line:84%
to show up to one incident
unless that incident requires

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.800 align:middle line:90%
every single cop on duty.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, what if there
is a shooting across town?

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.310 align:middle line:84%
What if there's a bank
robbery across town?

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.910 align:middle line:84%
What if there's a
drive-by across town?

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And you've got every
single uniformed officer

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:11.760 align:middle line:90%
in one location.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.590 align:middle line:84%
You can't respond
to another call.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:90%
So you would never--

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:84%
it would be against
police protocol

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:21.050 align:middle line:84%
to send every cop to
that mall unless it was

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:23.670 align:middle line:90%
something incredibly serious.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And the official story
of 30 kids or whatever

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.610 align:middle line:84%
fighting each other
with sticks does not

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:33.240 align:middle line:84%
qualify to call up 123
cars with 123 cops in it.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So there was
like initial reports that

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.950 align:middle line:84%
were made public that there
were kids that were letting off

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:42.300 align:middle line:90%
fireworks, perhaps, allegedly.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And this led to people
believing in the mall that

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:48.560 align:middle line:84%
weren't right there
but heard this noise

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.510 align:middle line:90%
and thought that was gunshots.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Again, that was not
what instigated the panic.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.750 align:middle line:84%
What instigated the panic was
seeing these three very, very

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:59.240 align:middle line:84%
tall non-humans
that caused everyone

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.830 align:middle line:84%
to be terrified and flee
from the mall immediately.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How were-- just
for instance, for example,

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.520 align:middle line:84%
if you're in this mall,
it's packed on this day.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.780 align:middle line:90%
There's lots of people there.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.280 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has a cell phone.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Why were there no actual
photographs or videos

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:21.200 align:middle line:84%
just from civilians
filming these creatures?

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Again, from the
credible eyewitness reports,

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:27.500 align:middle line:84%
as they were leaving the mall,
the cops had surrounded the mall

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and were stopping people
and checking their phones

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.440 align:middle line:84%
and deleting photos and
video so that no one got out

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.080 align:middle line:84%
with a single snapshot with a
single video that we have seen.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I think we would have
seen those snapshot pictures.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.545 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because
that's a lot of people

00:21:41.545 --> 00:21:43.290 align:middle line:84%
that they would
really have to check.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's why they had
such a big presence there,

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:51.530 align:middle line:84%
is to keep the whole
scenario under control maybe.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The only
tactical reason

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.590 align:middle line:84%
why you would
actually have 123 cars

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and cops is so that you
could circle a perimeter

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that no one
got through that circle

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.450 align:middle line:84%
without being
stopped and checked.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So give
us some examples

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.880 align:middle line:84%
of what the actual eyewitnesses
have claimed to see.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Eyewitnesses
claim to have seen three

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:90%
very tall, non-human figures.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And again, estimates that
the eyewitnesses were saying

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.640 align:middle line:84%
were between 8, 9, maybe
as tall as 10 feet.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.280 align:middle line:90%
We think it's closer to about 9.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.850 align:middle line:84%
But if you're 5 and 1/2, 6
feet tall and something's 8,

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:34.640 align:middle line:84%
9 feet tall, how are you going
to really tell the difference

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.040 align:middle line:84%
between, oh, that looks like
8 feet, oh, that's 10 feet?

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.423 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Unless you're standing
there with your tape measure,

00:22:41.423 --> 00:22:43.700 align:middle line:84%
you're going to guesstimate
about how tall you

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.050 align:middle line:90%
think that is.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And again, the credible
witnesses were just terrified

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:90%
of what was occurring.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.580 align:middle line:84%
They had no idea what
was occurring other

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:57.710 align:middle line:84%
than being in the presence of
three very large non-humans

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.950 align:middle line:90%
caused just a general panic.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:02.425 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I won't even say panic.

00:23:02.425 --> 00:23:04.550 align:middle line:84%
I will say again that the
credible witnesses, which

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.680 align:middle line:84%
were family members,
family men who

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.850 align:middle line:84%
had their wives and
their kids with them,

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:12.940 align:middle line:84%
who expressed feeling
like all of a sudden they

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:84%
felt the tingling on the back
of their neck, the turning

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:17.710 align:middle line:90%
in their gut.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:18.888 align:middle line:90%
Something was wrong.

00:23:18.888 --> 00:23:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, flight or fight.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, they got
the fight or flight first.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And then as soon as
they saw it, they

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:27.700 align:middle line:84%
just became instantly concerned
for the safety and well-being

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.160 align:middle line:84%
of their families and wanted to
get out as quickly as possible.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did they mention
any clothing or apparatuses,

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:37.130 align:middle line:90%
anything?

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:38.588 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The
eyewitnesses' reports

00:23:38.588 --> 00:23:41.830 align:middle line:84%
that, again, they were
seen in a similar fashion

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.330 align:middle line:90%
to the Vegas reporting.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:47.530 align:middle line:84%
They were seeing
a shimmer effect

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:49.190 align:middle line:84%
by looking at their
physical bodies.

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So instead of seeing a
sharp, defined image,

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:56.450 align:middle line:84%
there was a wavy fading in
and out, shimmery effect.

00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:01.540 align:middle line:84%
But they seem to
say that they had

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.660 align:middle line:84%
silverish skin
tones and/or we're

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.120 align:middle line:90%
wearing silverish clothing.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, there's technology
we're very aware of, Randy,

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.270 align:middle line:84%
you and I, about these
holographic imaging that

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:14.140 align:middle line:90%
we're very--

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.070 align:middle line:84%
they can do this
all over the place.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there's
any possibility

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.030 align:middle line:84%
that this may have
also had something

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:27.040 align:middle line:84%
to do with a test of some of
these technologies we have?

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.173 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, it's certainly
possible that was the case.

00:24:30.173 --> 00:24:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Because where did they
go/ It was like they were there.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the reports are saying,
well, they just disappeared.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: We have reports that
because Navy personnel showed up

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.730 align:middle line:84%
immediately via portal and
portaled them out of there very,

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:44.530 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Right, let's
talk about that.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's the report
that we have on that,

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:53.110 align:middle line:84%
was that Naval Space
Command personnel showed up

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:56.777 align:middle line:84%
through portal and then portaled
them out of there right quick.

00:24:56.777 --> 00:24:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was that
witnessed by anyone?

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Or were they putting up-- you
know how we can put up fields

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.330 align:middle line:84%
so no one can see what
we're doing in a given area?

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Or was anything witnessed
or anything leaked

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.950 align:middle line:84%
out besides the stuff
you already know?

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: There is one or
two eyewitness reports.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.480 align:middle line:84%
But they're not from
credible individuals.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.800 align:middle line:84%
They're from individuals that
seem to have maybe been very

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.632 align:middle line:90%
high on chemical substances.

00:25:19.632 --> 00:25:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And so you can't take
that what they said

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.210 align:middle line:90%
or what they saw accurately.

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.900 align:middle line:84%
But they seem to have-- there
were at least one or two

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.620 align:middle line:84%
eyewitnesses that reported
seeing a shimmering portal

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.520 align:middle line:84%
and people coming
in or out of that.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.860 align:middle line:84%
But those are not the
credible witnesses.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.320 align:middle line:84%
So we can't necessarily
take them at their word.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So online,
there are some witnesses

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.340 align:middle line:84%
that have filmed
some things, where

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:48.050 align:middle line:84%
the film during the exact
moment has a glitch in it.

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.790 align:middle line:90%
And then everything disappears.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And it goes right
back to the film.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:53.490 align:middle line:90%
What could cause that?

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I saw that
particular piece of footage.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.580 align:middle line:84%
I went through it frame
by frame about 10 times.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And while, yes, I can say
as a trained observer,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.360 align:middle line:84%
there appeared to be something
glitchy happening near the end,

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.700 align:middle line:84%
it cuts off right
at that point, too.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.490 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, that was
completely inconclusive.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
whatever was being

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:17.310 align:middle line:84%
seen there was not clear
enough, was not long enough.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.050 align:middle line:84%
It was an instant
that you're seeing it.

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:22.450 align:middle line:84%
It was what I would have to call
a completely inconclusive piece

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:23.250 align:middle line:90%
of evidence.

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about the
implications of the Miami Police

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:31.550 align:middle line:84%
officer that was online on that
video talking about the Bayside

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:32.763 align:middle line:90%
Mall event?

00:26:32.763 --> 00:26:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Actually,
I'm aware that there

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:36.270 align:middle line:90%
were two different videos.

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:40.880 align:middle line:84%
A senior officer who's been
there for years who is running

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.230 align:middle line:84%
for County Sheriff as well,
he was on the phone with his,

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:49.700 align:middle line:84%
I want to say, 17-, 18-, maybe
19-year-old son who's asking

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.140 align:middle line:84%
him, hey, Dad, come on,
tell me what happened.

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And he was like,
oh, come on, kid.

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:59.180 align:middle line:84%
You know I can't tell you, which
if the official story was even

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:03.890 align:middle line:84%
remotely true, the
answer would have been,

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:07.820 align:middle line:84%
let me confirm that the
official story is true by saying

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.550 align:middle line:90%
this is also what happened.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:15.380 align:middle line:84%
But if he's an old gray-haired
police officer, Miami Police

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:84%
officer, and he says,
you know I can't

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.730 align:middle line:84%
answer that question,
well, then we're

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.760 align:middle line:84%
talking about something
occurring that they have

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.170 align:middle line:84%
to keep covert and
keep classified,

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:27.338 align:middle line:84%
which is not the official
cover story at all.

00:27:27.338 --> 00:27:29.880 align:middle line:84%
It would to be something other
than the official cover story.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:35.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's evidence in
the absence of evidence.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:39.110 align:middle line:84%
But the evidence of him
saying I can't talk about it

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:45.320 align:middle line:84%
becomes a conclusive piece
of non-specific evidence

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.830 align:middle line:84%
that, why else would you
say that if the cover

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:51.380 align:middle line:90%
story was actually true?

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.180 align:middle line:84%
The only reason you
would say that is

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:57.150 align:middle line:84%
because the story that you don't
want people to know is true to

00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:58.720 align:middle line:90%
is actually true.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.097 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, you would say that.

00:28:00.097 --> 00:28:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And the
police officers could

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.890 align:middle line:84%
have been also
misinformed of maybe

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:06.390 align:middle line:90%
we're just testing technology.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:07.540 align:middle line:90%
And it went south.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.570 align:middle line:90%
We can't let anyone know.

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.855 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what they could
have possibly told them?

00:28:11.855 --> 00:28:12.655 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: True.

00:28:12.655 --> 00:28:15.210 align:middle line:84%
But again, you
have nobody who has

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:19.660 align:middle line:84%
gone on the record, no body cam
footage, no dash cam footage.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Normally, in an
incident of that size,

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.800 align:middle line:84%
you would have one
cop that would go off

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.950 align:middle line:84%
the record, one cop that
would talk to the local media

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.310 align:middle line:90%
and go off the record.

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:33.450 align:middle line:90%
But nothing, not one.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:38.670 align:middle line:84%
That's more suspicious than
the information would be.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.130 align:middle line:84%
The lack of
information turns out

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:43.680 align:middle line:84%
to be highly suspicious
in an incident

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.840 align:middle line:84%
where you have 123
cops on the ground.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.490 align:middle line:84%
You should have a
lot of information.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: For the public, yeah.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: You should
have 123 body cams.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.820 align:middle line:90%
You should have 123 dash cams.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:59.130 align:middle line:84%
You should have 123 cops that
had to fill out a report that's

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:00.700 align:middle line:90%
all part of the public record.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.660 align:middle line:84%
You can say, I want to
see the public record

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:06.550 align:middle line:84%
of the cops that filled
out their incident reports.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:08.740 align:middle line:84%
No one can see the
incident reports.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.480 align:middle line:90%
No one can see the body cams.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.520 align:middle line:90%
No one can see the dash cams.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:17.070 align:middle line:84%
That's a cover up of a story
that's not the cover story.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:19.967 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, again,
if it was, they

00:29:19.967 --> 00:29:21.300 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be afraid to tell that.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.140 align:middle line:84%
You would be able to see
the incident reports.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.730 align:middle line:84%
You'd be able to
interview one of the cops.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:26.080 align:middle line:90%
You'd see the dash cam footage.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.520 align:middle line:90%
You'd see the body cam footage.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.080 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that none of
that is available is way more

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:34.800 align:middle line:84%
indicative that they're covering
up something far more serious

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.990 align:middle line:84%
than the "cover story"
occurred at all.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How interesting that
a civilian footage made it

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.550 align:middle line:84%
to the media and made it online
showing the police officers

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.490 align:middle line:90%
there and what is claimed--

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:52.150 align:middle line:84%
allegedly to be claimed on the
internet of this giant creature

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:53.330 align:middle line:90%
walking by?

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Could you please debunk
that for the viewers?

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So the videos that I saw of that
were three different shots--

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:05.000 align:middle line:84%
one that was very low
def and very blurry,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.820 align:middle line:84%
one was slightly sharper but was
still very blurry and not high

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.670 align:middle line:84%
definition at all, and
then one high definition

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:14.450 align:middle line:90%
shot from the helicopter.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.590 align:middle line:84%
The high definition
shot shows that it's

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:20.480 align:middle line:84%
two police officers
on a series of steps

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.510 align:middle line:84%
so that one is on the
lower portion of the steps

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.510 align:middle line:84%
and the other on the
higher portion of the steps

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.930 align:middle line:84%
so that when you blend
the image together,

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:29.900 align:middle line:84%
it looks like something very
tall that's moving out of sorts.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.740 align:middle line:84%
But in that high definition
shot, it's just two cops

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:33.920 align:middle line:90%
walking on the steps.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So how are these
reported UFO sightings, ET

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.430 align:middle line:84%
sightings, all
these encounters--

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:43.210 align:middle line:84%
how do you think that's
influencing the general public?

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: From what we
can tell, the temperature

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.490 align:middle line:84%
of what the general
public at the moment

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:52.220 align:middle line:84%
is most of the general public
believes something's going on.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:55.060 align:middle line:84%
They believe there's
more happening than what

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:56.570 align:middle line:90%
they're being told of.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:57.758 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, let's say--

00:30:57.758 --> 00:31:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They're not happy
with the official responses?

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Not at all.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.760 align:middle line:90%
So let's just make a comparison.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.250 align:middle line:84%
30 years ago, if something
like this occurred,

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:09.950 align:middle line:84%
people would readily
believe the official story.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:13.300 align:middle line:84%
People would readily
believe that whatever

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.840 align:middle line:84%
the official story of tell
them that nothing to see here,

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.840 align:middle line:90%
they would believe that.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.400 align:middle line:90%
They would accept that.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.350 align:middle line:84%
You have the
opposite of that now.

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:23.330 align:middle line:84%
You have the vast majority
of people who are like,

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:25.370 align:middle line:90%
you're clearly lying to us.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:26.780 align:middle line:90%
You're not telling us the truth.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:27.697 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: It's obvious.

00:31:27.697 --> 00:31:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Something happened.

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:30.110 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:32.360 align:middle line:84%
But they've done an incredibly
good job of shutting--

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: They did.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.535 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: --the
information down.

00:31:34.535 --> 00:31:38.688 align:middle line:84%
So the leaks that normally would
flow from something like this

00:31:38.688 --> 00:31:40.480 align:middle line:84%
that then someone would
get a hold of, that

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.813 align:middle line:84%
would get to the media, they
managed to lock all of that

00:31:42.813 --> 00:31:43.613 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:31:43.613 --> 00:31:45.230 align:middle line:84%
That was pretty
impressive, actually.

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:47.147 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, Randy,
fascinating intelligence

00:31:47.147 --> 00:31:47.947 align:middle line:90%
on this.

00:31:47.947 --> 00:31:49.490 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
your perspective

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and sharing it with
us on the show.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: My
pleasure, thank you.

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.022 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith.

00:31:53.022 --> 00:31:54.930 align:middle line:90%
And this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.660 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
