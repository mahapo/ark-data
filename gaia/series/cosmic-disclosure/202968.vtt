00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Cosmic Disclosure,"
we are with Richard Doty,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.690 align:middle line:10%
a retired counterintelligence
agent who served in the Air

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.090 align:middle line:10%
Force Office of
Special Investigations.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately involved
with UFO ET-related content.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Richard.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.960 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here, Emery.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, you've had an inside
track to all this is going on.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had hands-on
with ET technology?

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.432 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I did.

00:00:43.432 --> 00:00:45.390 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let me give
you a little history.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.130 align:middle line:84%
In 1947, we had two alien
crafts crashed in New Mexico.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.290 align:middle line:90%
We recovered the crafts.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Inside each craft
there were components.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.960 align:middle line:84%
In one of the crash site, the
crash site near Corona, New

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Mexico, they found
a rectangle object.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.500 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was 26 by
17 by 2.5 centimeters.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.200 align:middle line:90%
Weighed about 728 grams.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.910 align:middle line:90%
They thought it was window.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.200 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't actually
place the window anywhere,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.700 align:middle line:84%
but that's what
they thought it was.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.520 align:middle line:90%
And this is 1947.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.260 align:middle line:84%
They transported
it to Los Alamos.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.400 align:middle line:84%
It sat on a shelf for
a number of years.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And one day, a technician
came into this room.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.050 align:middle line:84%
It was a classified
storage area.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And before he
turned the light on,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.080 align:middle line:84%
he saw something
glowing on the shelf.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.790 align:middle line:90%
And it kind of surprised him.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.710 align:middle line:90%
He turned a light on.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:84%
He walked over to it,
and it's this device.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.720 align:middle line:90%
They thought it was a window.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.370 align:middle line:84%
He immediately took
it to his boss,

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.410 align:middle line:84%
who was a scientist, a
top-notch scientist at Sandia

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.110 align:middle line:84%
and who was working
at Los Alamos.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.758 align:middle line:90%
And so they tested it.

00:01:53.758 --> 00:01:55.800 align:middle line:84%
They put it in a dark
room, turned the light off,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.740 align:middle line:90%
it glowed.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.660 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.610 align:middle line:90%
This is not a window.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:90%
And this is years later.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.680 align:middle line:84%
This is, like,
20-some years later.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>> What color was this glass?

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>> It was like Plexiglas.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Plexiglas?

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Clear Plexiglas.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.449 align:middle line:90%
It was a rectangle.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:10.770 align:middle line:90%
They called it CRO.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Crystal-- it was like a
crystalline substance.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.190 align:middle line:84%
They called it CRO,
Crystal Rectangular Object.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So then now they started
doing experiments on this.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
They started trying to
figure out what it was.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.413 align:middle line:84%
They had exposed it to
different types of light.

00:02:25.413 --> 00:02:27.830 align:middle line:84%
But there was always this--
when you turned the light off,

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.360 align:middle line:84%
there was always
this light glowing.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.030 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't believe there was
any kind of battery in there.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.750 align:middle line:84%
If this thing was in an
alien spacecraft that

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.020 align:middle line:84%
crashed 25 years before,
how can there still

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.820 align:middle line:90%
be energy in this thing?

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So they really
started studying it,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.270 align:middle line:90%
and they got more experts in.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:84%
They brought more
experts in to study it.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And they figured out there was
some kind of an energy device,

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.563 align:middle line:84%
because when they
put a demand on it,

00:02:53.563 --> 00:02:54.980 align:middle line:84%
it could power
virtually anything.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.280 align:middle line:84%
They started with small
little lights, you know?

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.580 align:middle line:84%
One-amp light bulbs
and other things.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.360 align:middle line:84%
They kept going
up and up and up.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
were trying to power,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.590 align:middle line:84%
they built this light
platform in this facility,

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.720 align:middle line:84%
and they could power
this light platform,

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.157 align:middle line:84%
but they couldn't figure out,
how can this thing power this,

00:03:15.157 --> 00:03:17.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when they didn't
know what the demand was?

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:84%
There was no way to gauge
it or turn it on and off.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.985 align:middle line:84%
So then they eventually put it
under an electron microscope,

00:03:22.985 --> 00:03:25.580 align:middle line:84%
and lo and behold, they
saw these little things

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.890 align:middle line:90%
moving inside.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And then they determined that
some of these little holes

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.490 align:middle line:90%
inside were like vacuums.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.220 align:middle line:84%
So they figured out, this is the
energy device inside the Eben

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.900 align:middle line:90%
craft, Eben craft 1.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So they started doing
experiments with it,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.440 align:middle line:84%
and they found that that was
a form of zero-point energy

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.260 align:middle line:90%
or vacuum--

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.470 align:middle line:84%
they called it Particle
Vacuum-Enhanced Energy Device,

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.750 align:middle line:90%
or PVEED.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.794 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see it either a
P with a dash and V-E-E-D,

00:04:00.794 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:90%
or all one word.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.830 align:middle line:84%
It has been in the
literature, some places

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.040 align:middle line:84%
in the literature
where they speculate

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.950 align:middle line:84%
that this type of energy
device could exist.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.240 align:middle line:84%
But of course, that was--
this is highly classified.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.790 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of scientists
around the world that's worked

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.030 align:middle line:84%
on it, trying to understand
it, tried to duplicate it,

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.390 align:middle line:84%
tried to reverse engineer
it, and so far we haven't.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know that even today
that we fully understand it.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.590 align:middle line:10%
I know there's top scientists
such as Dr. Hal Puthoff that

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:10%
has worked on it and many,
many other scientists.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.880 align:middle line:84%
They know what it does, but
they don't know why it does it.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And they can't figure
out what's inside.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're afraid
to break into it.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.680 align:middle line:84%
They chipped a little
bit off on one side

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.240 align:middle line:90%
and tried to analyze it.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.980 align:middle line:90%
It's an unknown substance.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.300 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what it is.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to be pulling
energy from the vacuum of time

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.880 align:middle line:90%
and space, unlimited energy.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.480 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly, exactly
how they explained it.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.440 align:middle line:84%
But how it was done, how they
do it, how it can be done,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.710 align:middle line:84%
or how you could
reverse engineer it

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.490 align:middle line:84%
or duplicate it is just
unknown to us at this time.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know if when they
chipped it that that piece also

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.190 align:middle line:84%
had the ability
to harvest energy?

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Ironically, it did.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:84%
They placed that in
a little container,

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and again, they turned the
lights off, left, came back

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.380 align:middle line:90%
and it's glowing.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.780 align:middle line:84%
So that little piece was
able to give out energy.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Whether it-- whether
it was actually

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.120 align:middle line:84%
able to generate anything
or power anything,

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:84%
but it was still able to
give out its own energy.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So did it display any other
unusual properties besides

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.890 align:middle line:90%
glowing?

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's
amazing that it gives off

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.345 align:middle line:90%
unlimited free energy.

00:05:49.345 --> 00:05:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it gave
off frequencies,

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.130 align:middle line:90%
different frequencies.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.100 align:middle line:84%
It stayed at a
constant temperature.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Didn't vary the temperature
regardless of what

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.160 align:middle line:90%
the demand was placed on it.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
figured, there

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.100 align:middle line:84%
has to be some sort
of an outside source.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.940 align:middle line:84%
They first thought
that it was-- might

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.360 align:middle line:84%
be being controlled by
the ET craft itself.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's away
from the ET craft.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.050 align:middle line:84%
The craft, remember, was out at
Area 51 in the Nevada desert,

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.270 align:middle line:84%
and the energy device
was at Los Alamos.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.450 align:middle line:90%
So they figured, ah.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.550 align:middle line:84%
It's being controlled
by that craft

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.730 align:middle line:84%
even though it's
hundreds of miles away.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.320 align:middle line:84%
So what they did, they took
it to a very remote facility

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.250 align:middle line:90%
underground, isolating it.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.915 align:middle line:84%
Nothing can-- no waves
could get into it.

00:06:37.915 --> 00:06:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And they started
testing it down there.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, it was doing
the same thing it was upstairs.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So then they figured
it wasn't the aircraft.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.830 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the spacecraft
that was controlling it.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:90%
It was controlling itself.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:58.250 align:middle line:84%
But it was getting energy from
the outside, the outside space.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So the craft now in Area
51, it was still humming

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and buzzing regardless that
this was underground now where

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.800 align:middle line:84%
normal frequencies
cannot permeate this,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.360 align:middle line:90%
to our knowledge.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.960 align:middle line:90%
It was underground.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.270 align:middle line:90%
It was shielded by the Earth.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.400 align:middle line:84%
So they were pretty sure that
no waves or anything, radio

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:90%
energy could get through to it.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, another thing they did was
they transported this thing out

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.590 align:middle line:84%
to Area 51 and they
placed it near the craft.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And when they did, all sorts
of things inside the craft

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:90%
lit up and became--

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.790 align:middle line:90%
came to life.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Almost similar to "Independence
Day" when that craft--

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:90%
when those aliens came to Earth.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.350 align:middle line:84%
That craft they had
underground started working.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:50.630 align:middle line:84%
This thing, the craft was
exhibiting characteristics

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.860 align:middle line:90%
that it didn't before.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the other
questions was if we have this

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.580 align:middle line:84%
energy device in Los Alamos,
how can this craft still--

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.090 align:middle line:90%
could we still generate things?

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.760 align:middle line:84%
This is before
they brought the--

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.640 align:middle line:84%
well, lo and behold, they opened
up one of those containers

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.950 align:middle line:84%
that I said was
under there, and they

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.540 align:middle line:90%
found another energy device.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Underneath the
craft in the floor.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>> In the floor area.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.470 align:middle line:84%
One of those container boxes,
they finally got it open,

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and inside was
another energy device,

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.370 align:middle line:84%
exactly like this
crystal rectangle

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.560 align:middle line:90%
object that they'd found.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.360 align:middle line:90%
It was in-- it was in the craft.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.800 align:middle line:90%
So there was two.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.990 align:middle line:90%
A primary and a backup, maybe?

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.590 align:middle line:84%
We don't know why, but there
was-- there was two of them.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So what would happen when
you'd place an energy demand

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.020 align:middle line:90%
on the CRO?

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>> It would power the demand.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the demand
was, it'd power it.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Have they duplicated
this technology anywhere

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.220 align:middle line:90%
in the world that you know of?

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I think they have.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:59.000 align:middle line:84%
I think we have a crude form
of it that has been developed

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.950 align:middle line:90%
by a particular company.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.490 align:middle line:84%
But there's-- I think the
government's holding on to that

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:05.700 align:middle line:90%
patent, so to speak.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:84%
So you know, the power
companies, power grid's

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.450 align:middle line:84%
not going to go
bankrupt if we suddenly

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.870 align:middle line:84%
start manufacturing these
things and sell them to a house.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine if you could
buy one of those things

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and put it up in
your house and power

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.300 align:middle line:84%
everything you want
without buying electricity

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:84%
from the local
co-op or the state?

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I can, every day.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] Me too.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I do imagine.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Me too.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] Hopefully,
it'll come to fruition soon.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.880 align:middle line:84%
What other technology
was recovered

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.050 align:middle line:90%
that you can talk about?

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a particular type
of system that they found that

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:45.830 align:middle line:84%
is probably pretty sensitive
right now that was later

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.410 align:middle line:90%
developed into a weapons system.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.280 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this like a
scalar interferometry?

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.220 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Oh, so you know--

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Energy beam weapons.

00:09:58.095 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, energy beam.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:09:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Radionics.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:00.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Energy beam.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Energy beam.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was an
energy beam weapon.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was a form of a
high-intensity laser,

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.190 align:middle line:90%
which we would consider it.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.050 align:middle line:84%
If we had to relate
it to something,

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.420 align:middle line:84%
we would say it was a
high-intensity laser.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:84%
But it was an energy
beam that done some--

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.630 align:middle line:84%
could do some really,
really heavy damage.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And what was the
spectrum on that,

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:30.190 align:middle line:84%
not as frequency but as of
the area that it could affect?

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:33.078 align:middle line:84%
You know, could it be adjusted,
this energy beam weapon?

00:10:33.078 --> 00:10:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>> To the best of my logic,
it would be adjusted.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly the range,
but it could be adjusted.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, we've been speaking
about the 1947 crashes with

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.010 align:middle line:90%
the Eben.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, were there any other
crashes like in 1945 to 1947?

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know about the 1945,
but I know about the Kingman

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.610 align:middle line:84%
crash in the early '50s, and
that was a different race

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:90%
of aliens.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ironic
things about Area 51

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:03.620 align:middle line:84%
is we had crafts from
different alien races.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.970 align:middle line:84%
So we had different technologies
that we had to understand.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And that was the most difficult
thing for our scientists

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.410 align:middle line:84%
to understand, is we
had an Eben craft.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:19.750 align:middle line:84%
The exterior of the craft
caused warp or a void.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.870 align:middle line:84%
This other craft
was more complexed.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.420 align:middle line:84%
It had something like
an antimatter pod.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.150 align:middle line:90%
It had these pods that exploded.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.730 align:middle line:84%
They had a big
explosion and fire

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.230 align:middle line:84%
because they were
trying to work on it.

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure exactly
how that happened.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.440 align:middle line:84%
So there's different
technologies.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.700 align:middle line:84%
The interior of
crafts were different.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%
How they were flown
was different.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.410 align:middle line:90%
So they're distinctly different.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:51.060 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing the same
between the Eben craft

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and the other two crafts that
I know of that was at Area 51.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.690 align:middle line:84%
They were entirely
different technologies.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Came from vastly
different places.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And so scientists had to sit
down and say, wait a minute.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:07.230 align:middle line:84%
We have to devote one
particular team, the alpha team

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and a bravo team
to the Eben craft.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And the other teams,
the delta and the tango

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.330 align:middle line:84%
teams we had to devote
to the other crafts,

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:84%
because they're so vastly
different in technology.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>> You speak of
these other craft.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.088 align:middle line:90%
Now where are they coming from?

00:12:21.088 --> 00:12:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know
where they came from.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know--

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.540 align:middle line:84%
I know that they had two
other crafts at Area 51

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.510 align:middle line:84%
in the S4 complex
that we had recovered.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.230 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know what
techno-- where they came from.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:39.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what particular
ET group flew them.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.930 align:middle line:84%
I believe one of them might
have been the Trantaloids,

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.310 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
that for a fact.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:45.900 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't briefed
into everything.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.900 align:middle line:84%
I do know the Eben craft
was flown by Ebens,

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.777 align:middle line:84%
and they came from Serpo,
as we talked about earlier.

00:12:51.777 --> 00:12:53.610 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know about
the other two crafts.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:90%
I know the crafts.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.310 align:middle line:90%
I saw the crafts.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.290 align:middle line:90%
One of them, I saw it fly.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.730 align:middle line:90%
It was very easy to fly.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very easy to fly.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that was the
one that Lazar worked on.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.960 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very easy to fly.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.350 align:middle line:84%
But we couldn't understand
it, the technology.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:11.340 align:middle line:90%
We sat there.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Our scientists sat there
and pulled a gauge here

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.095 align:middle line:84%
and pulled a gauge
there and figured out

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:19.200 align:middle line:84%
if we pull this lever,
it went this way.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.670 align:middle line:90%
And I'm--

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:21.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:21.585 --> 00:13:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm being facetious
in some of this.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.540 align:middle line:84%
But they eventually figured
out it flew, and they flew it.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And it could do things that
no other craft could do.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>> It's more like it was
allowing you to fly it and it

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.696 align:middle line:90%
was kind of, like, flying you.

00:13:35.696 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Exac-- that was exactly what
I was going to say, is it was--

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.820 align:middle line:90%
it had a brain of its own.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.940 align:middle line:90%
It had its own--

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:84%
in fact, a scientist said,
it has his own brain system.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.950 align:middle line:90%
It has its own thought system.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:52.428 align:middle line:90%
It was-- you weren't flying it.

00:13:52.428 --> 00:13:53.970 align:middle line:84%
It made you think
you were flying it,

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.100 align:middle line:84%
but it was flying
itself, because it was

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.050 align:middle line:90%
doing things that the pilot--

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.520 align:middle line:90%
and it was an Air Force pilot--

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Anticipating.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it was anticipating.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe it was
reading the brainwaves.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>> What did the craft actually
look like through the exterior,

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.450 align:middle line:90%
interior?

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:10.530 align:middle line:90%
Anything you could share?

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The exterior
was a saucer shape.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.760 align:middle line:84%
It was a saucer shape,
a regular saucer shape.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:84%
It had a little bow on top
similar to the McMinnville case

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.760 align:middle line:84%
in 1951, if you
can remember that

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.890 align:middle line:84%
as a ball-- little
ball of top of it.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was a bigger craft than
the other two that we had.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>> How big?

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>> It was probably
60 feet by 80 feet.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.710 align:middle line:90%
It was big.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:41.070 align:middle line:90%
And probably had a larger crew.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And if it was, in fact, the
Trantaloids or the Quantaloids,

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:49.520 align:middle line:84%
they were big, and they were
maybe the praying mantis type.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:84%
They would have to have a bigger
craft to fit inside of it.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Now the interior of the craft,
I only saw one picture of it,

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:84%
and I saw it from the
walkway going in, the ramp.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.795 align:middle line:90%
So I can't--

00:14:59.795 --> 00:15:02.480 align:middle line:84%
I can't explain what the
interior looked like.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:84%
I never saw that other
than in that ramp.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>> In your work, have you
ever heard anyone speak

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.260 align:middle line:84%
to scientists or your colleagues
about seeing a craft and then

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.830 align:middle line:84%
walking up into the
craft, and oh my gosh.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.150 align:middle line:90%
Look at the size of this inside.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:22.040 align:middle line:84%
It does not correlate with
the size of the craft outside

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.250 align:middle line:90%
that I just walked into.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>> A scientist at Los
Alamos experienced this.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.070 align:middle line:90%
He wrote a paper--

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.740 align:middle line:84%
I didn't read the paper,
but it was 100-page thick--

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:38.480 align:middle line:84%
explaining what he experienced
when he went into this craft.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And that was a second
craft, that it appeared

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.170 align:middle line:84%
a lot bigger inside than
it did on the outside,

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:50.240 align:middle line:84%
and why this distortion
occurred in size

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and variance of the size
by looking inside of it.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any other types
of technology that has been

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.210 align:middle line:84%
recovered that you can share
with us that also might have

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.650 align:middle line:90%
been reverse engineered?

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there were certain
other items or components

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:84%
inside the Eben 1 craft that
they later, years later,

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:15.710 align:middle line:84%
recovered, and tried to work, a
form of communications device.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:22.160 align:middle line:84%
A small almost cell
phone-size, the old flip phone.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And when they found it,
smart scientists even in 1947

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:32.410 align:middle line:84%
figured out it was
some kind of a phone,

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:34.040 align:middle line:84%
or thought it was
some kind of a phone.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>> But there wasn't
any way to dial or--

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.990 align:middle line:84%
so they just put it on the
shelf like everything else.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And later, some years later,
they started looking at it,

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:48.610 align:middle line:84%
X-raying it, looking at it under
microscopes, and figured out

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.410 align:middle line:90%
it was a communications device.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:54.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that they
ever used it for one,

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:84%
but they did find it to be
a communications device.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was a
long-range communications

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:84%
device or a short range,
I don't know that.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:84%
But they did determine to
be a communications device,

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.339 align:middle line:84%
and that's the only
other one I know of.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, now we know where
flip phones came from.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:15.490 align:middle line:10%
>> I-- I honestly think
you're absolutely right,

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:20.500 align:middle line:10%
because when I spoke to
Colonel Corso in person,

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.320 align:middle line:10%
he told me there's a
lot of technology that I

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.849 align:middle line:10%
didn't mention in that book.

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:26.829 align:middle line:10%
And some of it was
electronics and some of it

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:28.810 align:middle line:10%
was cell technology.

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any signs of
ET samples that have been

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.160 align:middle line:84%
collected that have
been used commercially?

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:90%
Many.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, Velcro.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:43.090 align:middle line:84%
If you would believe
Colonel Corso's book,

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:48.550 align:middle line:84%
different electronic
components that we created that

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.670 align:middle line:90%
was well before its time.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.980 align:middle line:90%
Wire, some wire fiber optics.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Fiber optics.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>> We advanced fiber optics.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.250 align:middle line:84%
This is probably one of
the most amazing parts.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.860 align:middle line:84%
If you don't believe
in UFO technology,

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:08.120 align:middle line:84%
if you don't believe
that we obtained fiber

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.700 align:middle line:84%
optics from alien
technology, there

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:15.080 align:middle line:84%
is this materialist-- material
scientist at Sandia Labs

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.450 align:middle line:84%
that wrote a book some
years ago about it.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if we hadn't
have gotten fiber tech-- fiber

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.010 align:middle line:84%
optic technology
in 1950, whatever

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:84%
the time period it
was that we got it

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.510 align:middle line:84%
that the government
decided to turn it over

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:32.940 align:middle line:84%
after the government
studied it for 10 years,

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.060 align:middle line:84%
it would have been
well into the '70s

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:38.210 align:middle line:84%
or probably '80s before
we could develop it.

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Because the particular type
of material used for fiber--

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:49.490 align:middle line:84%
fiber optics is something that
we would have never thought of.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.300 align:middle line:84%
We actually tried it and
threw it away, saying,

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.650 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to work.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.540 align:middle line:90%
But we perfected it differently.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And once we got the material
from the government,

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:02.735 align:middle line:90%
we realized, oh, wow.

00:19:02.735 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:84%
We were right in
the first place.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:08.040 align:middle line:84%
We just had to do a little bit
more tweaking here and there,

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:08.850 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And to find out it can
carry sound and frequency.

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:14.430 align:middle line:90%
Sound and frequency.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:15.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:15.360 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.485 align:middle line:84%
>> What other technologies
could you share with us?

00:19:17.485 --> 00:19:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of other
ones, but there would be--

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:23.730 align:middle line:84%
they probably are
still classified.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Energy weapon systems,
long-range communications

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:90%
devices, sound devices.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Little plugs that
you put in your ear

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:41.020 align:middle line:84%
and you are able to communicate
with someone 100 miles away.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.030 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.290 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And we have the technology
and it came from the ETs.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>> That's about all I can say.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Is there a weird
desk like described

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.930 align:middle line:90%
in Colonel Corso's book?

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes,

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.155 align:middle line:90%
>> And what does that look like?

00:20:00.155 --> 00:20:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Corso's book is
almost entirely truthful.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.160 align:middle line:84%
He relied on somebody
else to write some of it,

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.760 align:middle line:84%
and he was wrong
about the bodies

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.550 align:middle line:84%
from Corona going
through Fort Riley.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.180 align:middle line:84%
But everything else in there
is completely accurate.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's many,
many other people, especially

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:84%
in private industry that
said the same thing,

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:20.223 align:middle line:90%
that Corso's book is accurate.

00:20:20.223 --> 00:20:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, who was in
charge of this desk?

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And what other things can
you tell about how the way

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:25.680 align:middle line:90%
it works?

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the missions of
the weird desk was to obtain

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.900 align:middle line:84%
information from
all over the world,

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.680 align:middle line:84%
because the CIA had stations
almost in every country

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.850 align:middle line:84%
or-- and then sometimes
in different ports--

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
portions of countries, and
bring that information back

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:90%
to one desk.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And let that person
analyze the stuff,

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.145 align:middle line:84%
and then send it out to
the Office of Technology

00:20:55.145 --> 00:20:56.020 align:middle line:90%
and Research within--

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Office of Scientific
Intelligence or wherever

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:00.620 align:middle line:90%
within the CIA.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And if not, out to Los
Alamos, out to Sandia, and let

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:07.140 align:middle line:84%
them try to figure
out what we gathered.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:07.940 align:middle line:90%
How is this done?

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, is it just one person
responsible at the weird desk

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.260 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Or is it a collaboration
of governments

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and agencies and corporations
that says who gets what?

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I only know
of one aspect of it.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:28.400 align:middle line:10%
I know Ron Pandolfi
who was CIA had--

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.620 align:middle line:10%
controlled the weird
desk at one point.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.200 align:middle line:10%
But before that, there was
a guy by the name of Cline.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.190 align:middle line:10%
And he was a CIA operative.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:36.950 align:middle line:10%
He was a CIA employee.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.520 align:middle line:10%
And he had probably
the biggest weird desk,

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:46.110 align:middle line:10%
because he had the brainchild
of the CIA's operation regarding

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.400 align:middle line:10%
UFO activities.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Now he was retired
at the time, but he

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:53.370 align:middle line:84%
wasn't afraid to sit down and
tell you about the weird desk.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Every possible event that
occurred around the world that

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:01.470 align:middle line:84%
was reported back
from CIA stations

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:07.110 align:middle line:84%
to Langley that was weird or
strange or not understandable

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:90%
went through his desk.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And he told us about
some things that

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:13.740 align:middle line:90%
were literally unbelievable.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Such as?

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>> People disappearing,
absolutely disappearing

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.950 align:middle line:90%
in front of your eyes.

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:23.230 align:middle line:84%
An operation that occurred
in an Eastern Bloc country--

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
name the country--

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:29.340 align:middle line:84%
it was-- but it was
during a Cold War era.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.920 align:middle line:84%
They were at a
particular location,

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and there were CIA
officers in that area,

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:40.620 align:middle line:84%
performing somewhat
of a surveillance.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And to compound this all,
there was a remote viewing

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.930 align:middle line:90%
going on at the same location.

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:51.060 align:middle line:84%
This was highly classified,
and I hope it's not anymore,

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.490 align:middle line:84%
but I'll certainly
hear about it if it is.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And during this time
period, these two people

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:02.780 align:middle line:84%
were in a field,
and there was a UFO

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:07.610 align:middle line:84%
spotted not over these
people, but near them,

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:12.060 align:middle line:84%
by these officers,
these CIA case officers.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And when that UFO flew over,
these two people disappeared.

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was caught on camera--
or caught on a video.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Or back then it was I think
a-- whatever they used back

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.940 align:middle line:90%
in the '60s or '70s.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And that was reported back
with the film and everything.

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.470 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain that?

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.865 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to explain
how people disappear?

00:23:35.865 --> 00:23:37.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they went up
there and looked around,

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:38.740 align:middle line:90%
and there's nobody here.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:39.810 align:middle line:90%
They disappeared.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:40.890 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a trick.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:42.360 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't an illusion.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.630 align:middle line:90%
These people disappeared.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.520 align:middle line:90%
That was just one example.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So what was the conclusion
of how they were beamed up?

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.580 align:middle line:90%
What did they tell you?

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Mr. Cline said that
they figured that there was

00:23:54.900 --> 00:24:04.290 align:middle line:84%
some sort of device that the
UFO craft had that could cause

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:10.320 align:middle line:84%
a dematerialization of a human
and then beam them up and then

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.400 align:middle line:90%
rematerialize them.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Although obviously,
they never saw

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.333 align:middle line:84%
them rematerialize
anyplace, but there

00:24:16.333 --> 00:24:18.000 align:middle line:84%
had to have been some
kind of technology

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.030 align:middle line:84%
that they had that at
that time in the late '60s

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:23.040 align:middle line:90%
we couldn't understand.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.930 align:middle line:84%
But it piqued the interest of
the CIA and the CIA scientists,

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:30.360 align:middle line:84%
because once it got
to the weird desk,

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.480 align:middle line:84%
that thing went out
to different agencies.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.250 align:middle line:90%
Los Alamos, Sandia.

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Hey, look at this.

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:39.400 align:middle line:90%
Tell us how this could happen.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.650 align:middle line:90%
Tell us how we can do that.

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
back in those days,

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Sandia and Los Alamos
scratches their head and said,

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.270 align:middle line:84%
we have no idea how
that can be done.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:55.020 align:middle line:84%
We can probably dematerialize
something, but put them

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:58.500 align:middle line:84%
back together, the
million of atoms,

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.210 align:middle line:84%
it would be
literally impossible.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:07.560 align:middle line:84%
So there wasn't any
explanation for that.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>> What was his most amazing
event that was unexplainable?

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.247 align:middle line:90%
>> The disappearing.

00:25:12.247 --> 00:25:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>> The disappearing?

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And there was one other one
he was talking about in Turkey.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.510 align:middle line:84%
In northern Turkey, they
had a listening post ride--

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and this is during
the Cold War--

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.680 align:middle line:84%
a listening post ride on
the Turkish-Russian border.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And one night, they
saw this crash--

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:32.360 align:middle line:90%
this saw this object in the air.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And they started taking
pictures of the object,

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and the object started
flying from Soviet Union

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.390 align:middle line:90%
into Turkey airspace.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:43.130 align:middle line:90%
Of course, aircrafts--

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.650 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Turkish
aircrafts or American aircrafts,

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:49.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure-- but they went
on alert and they launched.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:50.765 align:middle line:90%
And as the--

00:25:50.765 --> 00:25:52.890 align:middle line:84%
I believe they were F-4s,
coming from whatever base

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:57.900 align:middle line:84%
in Turkey towards this craft,
as they got close to it,

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.700 align:middle line:90%
it just disappeared.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Was there a cloaking
device in it?

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.060 align:middle line:90%
Was there--

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Did the F-4
Phantoms see this, or--

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.457 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, F-4 Phantoms--
yes, the pilots reported it.

00:26:07.457 --> 00:26:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>> They reported it.

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Bogey in front of us,
bogey at certain altitude.

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:13.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I listened to the tape.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.590 align:middle line:90%
And then all of a sudden--

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Bogey dematerialized.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.420 align:middle line:90%
Bogey's gone.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, gosh.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.512 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you see it on the ground?

00:26:19.512 --> 00:26:21.060 align:middle line:84%
He was asking
ground controllers.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:21.860 align:middle line:90%
Negative.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:22.660 align:middle line:90%
Is it on radar?

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:23.650 align:middle line:90%
Negative.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Must be a Russian.

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, they figured maybe the
Russians had something secret.

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:30.160 align:middle line:90%
And maybe they did.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.520 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.370 align:middle line:84%
But he said that
was very strange.

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Now the US government and the
Pentagon has come forward with

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:40.190 align:middle line:84%
these Tic-Tac videos, you
know, Gimbal, FLIR, videos.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:43.600 align:middle line:84%
What are these craft, and
who's responsible for them

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.430 align:middle line:84%
if you have any
information about it?

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's a lot of
conjecture out there about

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.910 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:53.320 align:middle line:84%
There's people who are saying
that the incident in Nimitz

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.760 align:middle line:90%
was planned.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.290 align:middle line:84%
It was a psychological operation
by the United States Navy,

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:01.870 align:middle line:84%
because none of the planes
on the aircraft carrier

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.270 align:middle line:90%
were armed, alert planes.

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's highly unlikely,
and it just doesn't make sense.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.540 align:middle line:84%
But there are people
on the ship that

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:15.648 align:middle line:84%
were leading the crew members
to do this and to do that.

00:27:15.648 --> 00:27:16.690 align:middle line:90%
So there's a possibility.

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:21.280 align:middle line:84%
This guy a year or so ago
talked, come forth and say,

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.090 align:middle line:90%
it was a test.

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:24.550 align:middle line:84%
They were testing the
crew and those things

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:26.920 align:middle line:90%
were highly advanced drones.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.120 align:middle line:84%
But on the other side of it,
there's crew members that said,

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.390 align:middle line:90%
that's not true.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:33.190 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't there.

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:34.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.680 align:middle line:90%
I believe these crew members.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I spoke to
these crew members.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.590 align:middle line:90%
I spoke to the pilot.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:41.530 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to the enlisted people
that were on the combat alert

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:42.430 align:middle line:90%
control.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And they explained
it could not possibly

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:50.240 align:middle line:84%
have been a planned operation
or we would have known about it.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:55.210 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that the
commander or captain of a ship

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:58.768 align:middle line:84%
could do what he
did and be fooled.

00:27:58.768 --> 00:28:00.310 align:middle line:84%
It just-- it's not--
it's not where--

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.540 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:03.430 align:middle line:90%
I really don't know.

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:05.740 align:middle line:84%
It happened way
after my time period.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:10.570 align:middle line:84%
I know during my time period,
we did have tests like that,

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:12.580 align:middle line:84%
especially around nuclear
weapons storage areas

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.950 align:middle line:84%
where there was a
special group of people

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:17.590 align:middle line:84%
that tried to penetrate
them, fly over them,

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:18.490 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:21.820 align:middle line:84%
That was done during
the late '70s and '80s.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.220 align:middle line:90%
I knew about them.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.180 align:middle line:84%
We were briefed on them because
we would have been notified

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.170 align:middle line:84%
that some sabotage incident
happened in a nuclear weapons

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:32.350 align:middle line:84%
storage area, because that was
the number one priority that we

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:35.530 align:middle line:84%
had to safeguard was
nuclear weapons, number one.

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Nothing else came
above nuclear weapons.

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And we had to be able
to safeguard them.

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:43.210 align:middle line:84%
So if the incident happened in
a nuclear weapons storage area,

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:46.000 align:middle line:84%
we would know about it and
we would investigate it.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.050 align:middle line:84%
But we were always
briefed to, hey,

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:49.960 align:middle line:84%
you know, next week
on Tuesday, we're

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:84%
going to be doing this at
this nuclear weapons storage

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.060 align:middle line:84%
area, Ellsworth
Air Force Base or--

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Testing some
technology, some craft.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:28:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>> And they did it.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
security police--

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:06.592 align:middle line:84%
they really called in a helping
hand or a covered wagon,

00:29:06.592 --> 00:29:08.460 align:middle line:90%
and the ball went up.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:09.370 align:middle line:90%
But Pentagon knew.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Everybody up headquarters
knew it was a test

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.450 align:middle line:90%
and we knew what the test.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:17.980 align:middle line:84%
So I don't put it by the
navy or some other entity,

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:22.750 align:middle line:84%
some other agency that
was testing the Nimitz.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Now the Roosevelt, the incident
that happened on the Atlantic

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Ocean was more complicated,
and those planes

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:90%
had weapons on them.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:36.160 align:middle line:84%
So what they saw is different
than what the Nimitz saw,

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and I tend to believe more
that the real incident happened

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:42.310 align:middle line:90%
on the East Coast.

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So do you think these are
unacknowledged technologies

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.420 align:middle line:90%
or extraterrestrial?

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they are
acknowledged technology,

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:57.140 align:middle line:84%
but unknown to other military
branches, and it was a test.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:57.940 align:middle line:90%
I'd say that.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:58.773 align:middle line:90%
And that's my only--

00:29:58.773 --> 00:29:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I believe that well.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.180 align:middle line:90%
I believe that as well, Rick.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.477 align:middle line:84%
I think-- because they
do a lot of this testing,

00:30:03.477 --> 00:30:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and they're not going to
know about that for sure.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
anomalies that occurred.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:14.365 align:middle line:90%
The aircraft's not armed and--

00:30:14.365 --> 00:30:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Just in case.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Just in case.

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:19.000 align:middle line:84%
I know other people came
forth in saying it was a test,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.780 align:middle line:90%
and then other people deny it.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.585 align:middle line:84%
But I think it was
an acknowledge.

00:30:25.585 --> 00:30:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And another thing that
one of the pilots told me,

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.710 align:middle line:84%
it's strange that
it didn't actually

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:37.930 align:middle line:84%
threaten the safety of
an aircraft carrier.

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Because every ship
in that fleet--

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.340 align:middle line:84%
and I was never in the
navy, but I was told this--

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.710 align:middle line:84%
protects that aircraft
carrier, because the admiral's

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:46.180 align:middle line:90%
on that aircraft carrier.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.450 align:middle line:84%
So all these ships
there can be in a fleet,

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:51.740 align:middle line:84%
you know, eight or nine
ships plus a submarine,

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.070 align:middle line:84%
they protect that
aircraft carrier.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:57.010 align:middle line:84%
There was never any threat
to that aircraft carrier.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:01.090 align:middle line:10%
>> So what do you think about
Eric Davis saying that these

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:03.190 align:middle line:10%
craft are off world?

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Eric Davis must
know more than I do.

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And if he says that, maybe
he knows more than I do.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Or it could be part of
a disinformation campaign.

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>> That's exactly what
I was going to say.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.322 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be part of a
disinformation campaign.

00:31:14.322 --> 00:31:17.995 align:middle line:84%
>> When someone of that level
says something like that,

00:31:17.995 --> 00:31:21.010 align:middle line:84%
alluding to
extraterrestrial craft.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And it sounds more to me
like he was protecting something

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:26.140 align:middle line:84%
secret that we might
be testing out there.

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>> A new drone program,
which I understand we have.

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:31.630 align:middle line:90%
And that can do things at--

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:32.463 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, hypersonic.

00:31:32.463 --> 00:31:33.263 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:33.263 --> 00:31:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Anti-gravitic.

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it could
be that he was protecting

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.640 align:middle line:90%
something that was out there.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what I
did during my time period,

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:48.130 align:middle line:84%
try to convince you it was a
UFO when in fact it was an F-117

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:51.670 align:middle line:84%
or an A-12 or an Aurora,
or some other craft.

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:54.687 align:middle line:84%
Or a secret drone program,
as we had back in the '80s.

00:31:54.687 --> 00:31:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick, thank you so much
for coming on the show again.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:58.120 align:middle line:90%
It's always a pleasure.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.770 align:middle line:90%
You're very welcome.

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Emery Smith, and
this is "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
