>>EMERY SMITH: Today,
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.590 align:middle line:10%
we are with Tim who is
speaking with us from Germany.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Tim is a tactical advisor in
the covert governance in Germany

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.780 align:middle line:84%
that's related to
extraterrestrial life.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.680 align:middle line:90%
Tim, welcome to the show.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.517 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Thank you so
much for having me.

00:00:33.517 --> 00:00:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: In the undisclosed
intelligence projects,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.490 align:middle line:84%
you came across some
interesting information

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.910 align:middle line:90%
about our human origins.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.498 align:middle line:84%
How did you learn about
this information, Tim?

00:00:41.498 --> 00:00:42.540 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Yeah, that's true.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.710 align:middle line:10%
So basically, we
were using a system

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:10%
like an internet but
an internal intranet.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what
you could do was--

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.750 align:middle line:84%
because the URLs were encrypted,
you could change the numbers

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:84%
and then randomly see
some documents, which

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.040 align:middle line:84%
I did, actually, when I
was bored or something.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.270 align:middle line:84%
So I actually don't know
if this was planned ahead

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.630 align:middle line:84%
to give me access
to those documents

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.400 align:middle line:84%
or if I by any chance,
luckily hit those documents.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.410 align:middle line:84%
But I came across some
very interesting pages,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.270 align:middle line:84%
which were talking about the
history and the real ancestors

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:90%
of humanity actually.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.710 align:middle line:84%
So the documents stated that,
humans did not originate

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.820 align:middle line:90%
from Earth, which is shocking.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:84%
But also, if you think about the
nature and the very significant

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:84%
differences between humans
and other life forms

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.350 align:middle line:84%
on this planet,
it's clearly to see

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.620 align:middle line:84%
that there's some
alien nature to humans

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.213 align:middle line:84%
and the Homo sapiens right
in front of our eyes.

00:02:03.213 --> 00:02:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What did you learn
about our human origins?

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: What the pages revealed
was a story about a very

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.900 align:middle line:84%
ancient humanoid race
that actually originated

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:24.060 align:middle line:84%
on not-named aquatic planet
outside of our solar system.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.580 align:middle line:90%
And they were bipedal.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.680 align:middle line:90%
They looked differently.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.440 align:middle line:90%
It's what the documents stated.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And they came across certain
difficulties and challenges

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.170 align:middle line:90%
on this planet--

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.080 align:middle line:84%
repeated attacks of
other aquatic beings,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.310 align:middle line:90%
huge aquatic beings.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.820 align:middle line:90%
So there was a drawing in it--

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.430 align:middle line:84%
much, much, much
larger than anything

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.210 align:middle line:84%
that we have on this planet
or ever had on this planet,

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:84%
like huge whales or whale,
shark-like creatures.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And they were constantly
attacking those cities

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.070 align:middle line:84%
that were under water,
because this planet actually

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.270 align:middle line:90%
had no landmass.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.030 align:middle line:84%
So these beings decided
to search for another home

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and build the technology
necessary for that,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:90%
went into other solar spaces.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
landed on this planet

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and founded the
civilization that we now

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.910 align:middle line:84%
have that is quite distinct
to other civilizations

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.560 align:middle line:90%
and other life forms.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What role did
pre-historic sea creatures play

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.410 align:middle line:84%
in the downfall of the original
underwater human civilizations?

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So the
civilization was used

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.670 align:middle line:84%
to build their cities
as domes on the water.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:90%
So that is what they did.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.590 align:middle line:84%
They were not
necessarily looking

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.320 align:middle line:84%
for a planet that
has a landmass.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:84%
But they were looking for
clean, blue rivers and oxygen.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And not so many dangerous
creatures around.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.030 align:middle line:84%
So this is exactly what
planet Earth is like.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And the document
stated that they

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:84%
went underground and actually
founded their city there.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And it makes me
think, because we all

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:84%
know this story about Plato
talking about Atlantis.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And since I came across this
document, I was thinking,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.650 align:middle line:84%
it might have been
like this or it might

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.550 align:middle line:90%
be related to this as well.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So even tales about mermaids
could make more sense

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.930 align:middle line:84%
if we think about this
story in our hands.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How far back are
we talking about here?

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: That's something that
the document did not state.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.150 align:middle line:84%
So the mainstream theory has
that Homo sapiens is here

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.410 align:middle line:90%
for 70,000 years.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.580 align:middle line:90%
The other thing about time is--

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.590 align:middle line:84%
and that's the theory that we
learn in the projects that,

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:84%
you cannot trace back linear
time further away than about

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.590 align:middle line:84%
15,000 years, because then
you have different observers

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and then everything
gets confusing.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not quite sure
how long ago that is.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.230 align:middle line:90%
But it must be quite some time.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And what I also learned is that
Earth wasn't the only planet.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So they were looking exactly for
blue planets, a lot of water,

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.940 align:middle line:84%
because that is
what they came for.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.060 align:middle line:84%
They were breathing
air, oxygen in that way,

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.060 align:middle line:84%
which is not
surprising because most

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.340 align:middle line:84%
beings, in this taxonomic
group, are also breathing air.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:84%
But they were actually looking
for this kind of planet.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.280 align:middle line:90%
And they found Earth.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.910 align:middle line:84%
But they also found different
other planets, blue planets,

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.050 align:middle line:84%
that were just in the habitable
zone and could host them.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the
documents stated

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:84%
that these beings, which
I don't have a name to,

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.550 align:middle line:84%
they were clearly
stating and convinced

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:84%
that they are ancestor
or related to the most

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.540 align:middle line:90%
primal, most holy beings.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:20.390 align:middle line:84%
So they saw themselves as a
very highly evolved species.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And I would even say
that through the decades

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.000 align:middle line:84%
and through all the stages of
influencers on this planet,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.100 align:middle line:84%
that those beings, those
ancestors, those relatives

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.660 align:middle line:84%
were higher evolved and
probably, genetically

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.660 align:middle line:84%
purer than the product,
the mixed product,

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.940 align:middle line:90%
that we got on Earth right now.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How did these
aquatic beings fit in relation

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:47.840 align:middle line:90%
to other beings?

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Again, the
human evolution

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.940 align:middle line:90%
went through different stages.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:07:00.650 align:middle line:84%
But certain features
and attributes

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.560 align:middle line:90%
seem to have still remained.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So there is this theory
about the aquatic ape that

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.230 align:middle line:90%
can be found in the human DNA.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And there are some features
that do not match the mainstream

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.310 align:middle line:90%
evolutionary theory.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.680 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
skin that humans have

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.270 align:middle line:84%
is much more elastic compared
to different other primates.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Babies can swim when
they're born, which is very

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.300 align:middle line:90%
unusual for land-type mammals.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.810 align:middle line:84%
There are other features,
for example, the body hair,

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.170 align:middle line:84%
compared to any other
being on this planet,

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:84%
humans or Homo sapiens doesn't
have very, very much body hair

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:84%
which allows for a more
aquadynamic flow in the water.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Homo sapiens are
able to-- on purpose,

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:84%
they can stop their
breathing routine.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So that would allow
for diving into water.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:10.040 align:middle line:84%
So there are all these kind of
features and different aspects

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.140 align:middle line:84%
that are mentioned
in this theory.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.990 align:middle line:90%
And they somehow align with--

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.790 align:middle line:84%
somewhere along the
line, we could have

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.112 align:middle line:90%
come from an aquatic species.

00:08:19.112 --> 00:08:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How did the original
underwater human beings

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:84%
differ from the modern humans in
their appearance and abilities?

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: The document
clearly stated, they

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.500 align:middle line:90%
had a humanoid form.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Though it was not really
clarified what type of form.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:40.970 align:middle line:84%
They must have been clearly
distinct to what nowadays,

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.240 align:middle line:84%
humans look, because
what we've learned

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.470 align:middle line:90%
is that humans or Homo sapiens--

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.660 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call
them that way--

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:55.520 align:middle line:84%
are actually a mixed product
of different genetic, lineages,

00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and lines, and different other
organic and not so much organic

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.220 align:middle line:90%
influences.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And the end result
of that always

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:13.350 align:middle line:84%
seems to come out as what you
would call a Homo sapiens.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
particularly interesting.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.510 align:middle line:84%
That we have the same
evolutionary line

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.970 align:middle line:90%
on other planets as well.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:26.250 align:middle line:84%
It almost came to me like if
you're mixing different colors

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:84%
from your palette and you
always end up with a certain,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, muddy
color, which is not meant

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.850 align:middle line:90%
to be offensive or something.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.580 align:middle line:84%
If whatever color you
put into the glass,

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.180 align:middle line:84%
you always come out
with the same type

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.730 align:middle line:84%
of color of end
result. So this is

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:84%
how it seems to be with Homo
sapiens as well on this planet

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.730 align:middle line:90%
and on other planets.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And do they adapt
to colonize other planets?

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: The documents stated
that they also have founded

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.500 align:middle line:90%
colonies--

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.800 align:middle line:84%
not only on Earth,
but also on Andromeda,

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.380 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in the Pleiades,
the Cassiopeia System.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.130 align:middle line:84%
So different other solar
systems that are not

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.650 align:middle line:90%
too far away from Earth.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.260 align:middle line:90%
So it must be somewhere around.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.800 align:middle line:84%
The document also stated
that the original planet

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.500 align:middle line:84%
they came from did
not have a landmass

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.130 align:middle line:84%
but a very dense
thickening foam that was

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.860 align:middle line:90%
floating on the surface water.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.440 align:middle line:84%
From the description
of the document,

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.260 align:middle line:84%
it seems like the
cities were underwater.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:38.680 align:middle line:84%
They had bubbles of air, in
that way, where they could just

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.750 align:middle line:90%
breathe and live.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But as there was no landmass
and those really huge creatures,

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.330 align:middle line:84%
so it seems like even
the megalodon, which

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:54.700 align:middle line:84%
was the biggest shark in
history, would have been easy

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.970 align:middle line:84%
prey to those whale
shark beings that were

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.560 align:middle line:90%
portrayed on the documents.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.110 align:middle line:84%
They were constantly
attacking those cities.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And even if they had
the technology in order

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:11.290 align:middle line:84%
to defend them and to make
that kind of a stable life,

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:17.290 align:middle line:84%
they knew that this would not
be a constant state in order

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.788 align:middle line:84%
to thrive and
build their cities.

00:11:20.788 --> 00:11:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There have been many
myths from ancient times.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And even more recently,
underwater cities

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.760 align:middle line:84%
that some people claim to
have seen at a distance.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Do you think these underwater
cities that are domed and lit

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.920 align:middle line:90%
up are the beings you speak of?

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I find that very
interesting actually.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:39.490 align:middle line:84%
I have no intelligence
about that--

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.770 align:middle line:90%
if it's true or not--

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:46.570 align:middle line:84%
because after all, these
myths and fairy tale stories,

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:48.340 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, the
ocean plays a huge role

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:55.610 align:middle line:84%
in mostly all cultures
around the world,

00:11:55.610 --> 00:12:00.040 align:middle line:84%
which is very eminent
and very clear to see.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.670 align:middle line:84%
But also, these
stories about Plato's

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis, mermaids,
all these connections

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:17.080 align:middle line:84%
that we have with even fear of
huge, monstrous, aquatic beings

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:84%
that were described in
different ancient texts.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be something
that came down the line

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.370 align:middle line:90%
into our consciousness.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't say
that any land type

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.360 align:middle line:84%
mammal would have this
strong connection to the sea

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.115 align:middle line:90%
that humans have.

00:12:36.115 --> 00:12:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: When you
think about it,

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.760 align:middle line:84%
we've got whales,
dolphins, seals,

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.120 align:middle line:84%
walruses that come in and
out of the water, especially

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:84%
in the case of
seals and walruses.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.440 align:middle line:84%
They spend extended periods
of time in the water.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Is there any connection
to them in relation

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.910 align:middle line:90%
to this ancient species?

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: I wouldn't say so.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.310 align:middle line:84%
I would say that,
well, water is clearly

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:01.750 align:middle line:84%
a life environment that offers
a lot of opportunities for life

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:84%
to evolve, a lot of nutrition,
and a lot of climatic benefits.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.710 align:middle line:84%
But what we see is
that different species

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:90%
evolve differently in water.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:18.670 align:middle line:84%
I think that the relationship
that we have towards water,

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.290 align:middle line:90%
like a lot of us feel this--

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.030 align:middle line:84%
from our heart, we feel
this connection to the sea,

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.100 align:middle line:90%
in some ways, and we feel calm.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is
scientifically researched.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:34.600 align:middle line:84%
I would say that this comes
from this genetic line.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Many others,
including you,

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.400 align:middle line:84%
have talked about several
extraterrestrial influences

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.750 align:middle line:84%
on the development of an
evolving human genome.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do these aquatic beings
fit in the relation to others?

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, so what we
know-- and this was not

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:50.840 align:middle line:90%
stated in the document.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:55.760 align:middle line:84%
But this came across through
different other projects

00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.260 align:middle line:84%
is that, different other
highly evolved intelligences

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:84%
had interest in this planet and
bringing life to this planet.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So we know that at different
places and locations

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.170 align:middle line:84%
around the planet, these
highly evolved intelligences

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:19.850 align:middle line:84%
have put, what we call,
sample groups of DNA

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:23.660 align:middle line:84%
of different beings
around the planet.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And along the time, all
these different sample

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:32.195 align:middle line:84%
groups confused, and mixed with
each other, intermingled, pair

00:14:32.195 --> 00:14:36.290 align:middle line:90%
it had war over certain things.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And that basically, resulted
in Homo sapiens in the form

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.860 align:middle line:90%
that we have it today.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, how dominant
is their influence

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.100 align:middle line:84%
inside the human DNA
compared to others?

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I might not be
the one to answer that.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:59.580 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that there are
many more genetic influences

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.530 align:middle line:84%
that are more
dominant in that way.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think, because it's
so far away, genetically,

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:11.580 align:middle line:84%
that we've ended up with a
very different, mix product

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:84%
right now that has its own
history, its own reception

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.950 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And I only think that it might
mean something spiritually

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:32.520 align:middle line:84%
to us to know that we're coming
from beings that felt purer

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.430 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
if that's something

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:39.120 align:middle line:84%
valuable to acknowledge
for yourself.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.750 align:middle line:84%
But knowing that there are
other human species out there--

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:47.690 align:middle line:84%
relatives that already
made contact with.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And that might be an
option for upcoming times

00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:00.740 align:middle line:84%
to either travel there or
make experiences with them,

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:90%
that might be very significant.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And I already know
that there are

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:10.700 align:middle line:84%
plans to take sample
groups or certain groups

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.070 align:middle line:90%
from this social system.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And bring them to another
human social system just

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.050 align:middle line:84%
in order to have this kind of
exchange between the species,

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.110 align:middle line:84%
because all those
different human planets,

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:middle line:84%
they have different foci on
how they structured life.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And well from what I know, there
are significant achievements

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:40.580 align:middle line:84%
out there that could
very, very much

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:45.860 align:middle line:84%
help and bring benefit
to this planet actually.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who are the
original ones doing

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.550 align:middle line:84%
this seeding experiment
that were much more evolved

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:51.660 align:middle line:90%
and advanced?

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: There are different
parts to this question.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking
about the beings that

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.690 align:middle line:84%
came here and originated
on a different planet,

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:04.290 align:middle line:84%
the document stated
that they were directly

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.750 align:middle line:84%
coming from the
most primal source,

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.069 align:middle line:90%
from the most holy source.

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:11.890 align:middle line:84%
So I would assume that if
you want to put it that way,

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:13.770 align:middle line:84%
they were directly
coming from source.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And that this was their first
evolutionary manifestation

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:22.660 align:middle line:84%
in that way, almost
like angelic beings

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:27.970 align:middle line:84%
in that sense, if you want to
put it biblically or something.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:31.530 align:middle line:84%
So if you're talking
about the experiments

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and the other events that
took place along the line,

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:43.830 align:middle line:84%
I would say that we know that
around 15,000 years ago--

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:47.130 align:middle line:84%
because that is the moment when
we have different observers,

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.110 align:middle line:90%
different high intelligence--

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.920 align:middle line:84%
were always and all
focused on Earth

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle line:84%
to make their own
playground in that way.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.510 align:middle line:84%
This has to do with higher
forms of intelligence

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.310 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness
in the universe.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.360 align:middle line:84%
It's more like the
source itself split up

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:11.820 align:middle line:84%
into different
intelligences and were

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:17.700 align:middle line:84%
playing with the planet and the
material that it found there.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And we had that in
different layers

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.710 align:middle line:84%
that were influencing
each other.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:90%
So it's fairly complicated.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, that's actually where
all these different influences

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.860 align:middle line:90%
came from.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Let's focus just on
the role, for example,

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.520 align:middle line:90%
what the Gray's have.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.000 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the
Gray Intelligence

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.640 align:middle line:84%
was one of those primal
intelligences that

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:48.190 align:middle line:84%
were playing with the
playfield, playground of Earth

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.300 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.650 align:middle line:90%
What they have found--

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:56.110 align:middle line:84%
and they became aware that
those beings are underwater.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:19:00.520 align:middle line:84%
They became aware that
they offer this very

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.040 align:middle line:90%
pure form of genetic material.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And they used that
in order to influence

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.800 align:middle line:84%
their own genetic line,
their own manifestation.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And they took parts
of this genetics

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:18.190 align:middle line:84%
that they found there
and introduced it

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.900 align:middle line:90%
to their own line.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.360 align:middle line:84%
So you also have
this genetic factor

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.640 align:middle line:84%
outside and off planet
in that particular case.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And that happened many,
many, many other times

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:90%
along the line.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, you end
up with a Homo sapiens.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So these original,
aquatic, humanoid beings,

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.820 align:middle line:84%
do you think there's any chance
they still may exist somewhere

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.500 align:middle line:90%
under the oceans?

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: I actually have
asked that question myself

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:90%
so many times.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.660 align:middle line:84%
So the document is
not stating that.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:57.030 align:middle line:84%
The document says that along
thousands and thousands

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:01.350 align:middle line:84%
of years and all these
mixtures, you always

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.720 align:middle line:84%
end up with a Homo
sapiens, because that

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:09.670 align:middle line:84%
is more or less the end product
in this 3D realm that we have.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:14.190 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that
these beings were clever.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:16.140 align:middle line:90%
They had technology.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:20.550 align:middle line:84%
The cities that were
described in the document

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:25.230 align:middle line:84%
were very much evolved,
highly evolved cities.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And they had the technology
to go off planet.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And even found a new
civilization somewhere else

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.850 align:middle line:84%
throughout different
solar systems.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:36.910 align:middle line:84%
So I would say
that the challenges

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:41.660 align:middle line:84%
that they faced, here on Earth,
might have been new to them.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed that it was
a unique case here on Earth

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.770 align:middle line:84%
and it was unique cases
on other planets as well.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.330 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that a
species that is this clever

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:57.220 align:middle line:84%
will, in any form, still exist
in the universe-- maybe not

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.030 align:middle line:84%
on this plane of reality,
maybe on a higher frequential

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.140 align:middle line:90%
plane or something.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.810 align:middle line:84%
But I'm very convinced
that they still exist.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And they are still very much
worshiped on other planets

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:14.710 align:middle line:84%
in a form very similar
to the ancestor cult

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:18.040 align:middle line:84%
that we have, for example,
in different ancient tribes

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.790 align:middle line:84%
that we still pray and still
communicate to our ancestors

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:23.170 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think there'll
be a time when they return?

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: If you ask me personally,
I would say they've never gone.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.240 align:middle line:84%
So all humans are
still products of them

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.150 align:middle line:84%
even though they have different
other influences in them,

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:42.260 align:middle line:84%
as well, in different soul
aspects and so much more.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:46.330 align:middle line:84%
But I would also say that these
beings, through what I read,

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:53.060 align:middle line:84%
they feel very, very similar to
angelic beings in that context.

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So I would say they exist in
a different reality plane.

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't say
they ever left.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How might the
discovery of humanity's

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:06.370 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial origins change
our understanding of our place

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:07.815 align:middle line:90%
in the universe?

00:22:07.815 --> 00:22:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: What's super
fascinating to me is actually

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:84%
to know not only that the
universe is full of life forms.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:20.890 align:middle line:84%
I think, that is something that
we all can accept in some way,

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:24.190 align:middle line:90%
because it's such a huge space.

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:25.780 align:middle line:90%
And we have life.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, basically, this is life.

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:28.900 align:middle line:90%
So life is everywhere.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:34.300 align:middle line:84%
But to know that there are also
relatives, very, very closely

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and nearby to this
planet, this might be

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.710 align:middle line:90%
interesting to a lot of people.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:43.150 align:middle line:84%
So you still have
family, in that way,

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:47.350 align:middle line:84%
outside of this solar system
and on different other planets.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And they might have
socially and structurally--

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:53.750 align:middle line:84%
and we found that they
have evolved differently.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.810 align:middle line:90%
They have different societies.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.840 align:middle line:84%
But they are very,
very, very comparable

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:90%
to humans on this planet.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And they also keep
a very close eye

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:09.400 align:middle line:84%
since they know that, well,
humans exist on this planet.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.480 align:middle line:84%
They keep a very close eye
on this planet as well.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.150 align:middle line:84%
They are more aware
of their relatives.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, thank you so
much for being on the show.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.118 align:middle line:90%
It's always great having you.

00:23:21.118 --> 00:23:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you so much.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.238 align:middle line:90%
I enjoyed it.

00:23:23.238 --> 00:23:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith.
