>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.747 align:middle line:10%
we are joined by Victoria
Whitney, a Doctor of Science

00:00:24.747 --> 00:00:26.330 align:middle line:10%
and a retired member
of the Department

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.290 align:middle line:10%
of Defense, United States Navy.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are discussing
Earth's history

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:90%
according to the Arcturians.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:90%
Victoria, welcome.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.857 align:middle line:84%
>>VICTORIA WHITNEY: Well,
thanks for having me here.

00:00:35.857 --> 00:00:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What can you tell us
about a certain Arcturian city

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.920 align:middle line:90%
which initiated the starseeds?

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.094 align:middle line:10%
>>WHITNEY: So our
friend Koh Ni Dah,

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:45.927 align:middle line:10%
who called himself Cat
Stevens, during the--

00:00:45.927 --> 00:00:47.000 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY: Cat Stevens.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.710 align:middle line:10%
>>WHITNEY: --Homeless
Project was Arcturian.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.090 align:middle line:10%
There was also
another Arcturian,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.730 align:middle line:10%
but I never interfaced with him.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:90%
He was onboard ship.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.540 align:middle line:90%
He was the data analyst.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.930 align:middle line:84%
But Koh Ni Dah was very
approachable, very friendly.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.069 align:middle line:84%
He felt that if he conveyed
enough knowledge to us,

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.380 align:middle line:84%
that we would begin to
evolve to a higher state.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.040 align:middle line:84%
So he was going to do
everything he could to do that.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.200 align:middle line:84%
At one point, we talked about
the city that he came from.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.880 align:middle line:84%
It was called Delthinae Asriel,
and this city is a crystal city.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And so the center of the city
has this 40,000-foot crystal

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.890 align:middle line:84%
spire, and then the rest of
the city is built around that.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
they do that is it

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.170 align:middle line:84%
handles all of their
power requirements,

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and then this very
resonant frequency

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.380 align:middle line:90%
is held within the city.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And that resonant frequency
that's held within the city

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.200 align:middle line:90%
is for their consciousness.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And on the outside
of the city are

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.420 align:middle line:84%
what they call Camino Spheres,
so they're big spheres.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.780 align:middle line:84%
They're hooked in a
ring around the city.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.762 align:middle line:84%
And then communities live
inside these spheres.

00:01:57.762 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How big
are these spheres?

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So we live
in this little place

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.612 align:middle line:90%
called Port Orchard.

00:02:02.612 --> 00:02:06.170 align:middle line:84%
I believe we have 10,000
people that live in that area.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.954 align:middle line:84%
And he said we could fit Port
Orchard in one of the spheres.

00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:09.754 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, Wow.

00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So it's got
to be fairly good size.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.360 align:middle line:84%
But it's-- they have these,
for lack of a better word,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.390 align:middle line:84%
living spaces that are
inside these spheres,

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.470 align:middle line:84%
and it maintains a resonance
that keeps them consciously

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.590 align:middle line:90%
connected.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And so, like they
say, whatever they

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.960 align:middle line:84%
learn in some elevated
knowledge form,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.060 align:middle line:84%
gets transferred to
all of the spheres,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.190 align:middle line:90%
so they all know the same thing.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Some point in time, millions
and millions of years

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.260 align:middle line:84%
ago, I believe, based
on what they've told us,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.250 align:middle line:84%
that they were meant to
be the starseed keepers,

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.910 align:middle line:84%
in other words, the
history of the starseed.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And they have what they
call a living archive there.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:84%
They've explained to us that
literally everything that's

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.470 align:middle line:90%
in it is living history.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.835 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: How is that maintained?

00:03:04.835 --> 00:03:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, it would
be hard to say what that is.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.430 align:middle line:84%
But what they're telling me is
that this is living history.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.160 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
can interact with it,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.610 align:middle line:84%
and it will provide you with
the knowledge of what that is.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:84%
So they were asked to be the
keepers of the starseed history,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and so that resides within
this living archive.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And when I talked with Koh
Ni Dah, he would tell me,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.620 align:middle line:90%
this is your history on Earth.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.900 align:middle line:84%
You were meant to be one
of the seeded planets.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.713 align:middle line:84%
And they were meant to be one
of the seeded planets as well.

00:03:40.713 --> 00:03:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: How many are there?

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Seeded
planet, there's

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.815 align:middle line:84%
more than they could
ever put a number to.

00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:46.615 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: OK.

00:03:46.615 --> 00:03:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Right, so it's huge.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.065 align:middle line:84%
And you can't just ask them
and say, what species is that?

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't
work that way.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.520 align:middle line:90%
The starseeds are many--

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.760 align:middle line:90%
you have three founder races.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.782 align:middle line:84%
So you have what they
called the Argattians.

00:04:02.782 --> 00:04:06.950 align:middle line:84%
They since became what
we call Agartha on Earth.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.690 align:middle line:90%
But you had the Argattians.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.314 align:middle line:84%
You had the Indigos, and
you had the Oraphims.

00:04:12.314 --> 00:04:17.899 align:middle line:84%
And they were considered to be
the creators of the seeding,

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.529 align:middle line:84%
and it required
all three of them

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.030 align:middle line:84%
to do this because there are
different elements of that.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:29.022 align:middle line:84%
One is the RNA or the DNA
being messaged across things.

00:04:29.022 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
One of them is
what they consider

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.955 align:middle line:90%
the light or the spark of life.

00:04:35.955 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is considered
to be that which makes us

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:90%
a species, whatever that is.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.930 align:middle line:84%
So it required all three of
them to interact in this.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.150 align:middle line:84%
They had a part to
play in all of that.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And so throughout
history, the intent was--

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:84%
is that the universe
would be seeded,

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:84%
and then they would sit back
and watch the development

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:90%
of these species.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Very much when people
talk about watchers,

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:84%
they're talking about
a function of what

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.200 align:middle line:90%
the founders were trying to do.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.230 align:middle line:84%
In other words, are
they looking at it

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.940 align:middle line:84%
to see what's the next
evolutionary process of that?

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Probably, right?

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.372 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:05:17.372 --> 00:05:18.955 align:middle line:84%
It is happening all
over the universe.

00:05:18.955 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Indeed, right.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.840 align:middle line:90%
And in many forms, right?

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a good
experiment in the laboratory.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.913 align:middle line:84%
If I combine this with
this, you get one thing,

00:05:27.913 --> 00:05:29.580 align:middle line:84%
but if I combine it
with something else,

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.538 align:middle line:90%
you get something else.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's sort of
what they were doing,

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.330 align:middle line:84%
was looking at how many
different types of species

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.870 align:middle line:90%
they could create.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
mention somewhere

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.850 align:middle line:84%
where I was talking
with Koh Ni Dah,

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and he talks about the
silicon species, right?

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:45.480 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Because we talk about
carbon-based species

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.170 align:middle line:84%
all the time, but we don't talk
about silicon-based species.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.092 align:middle line:84%
How does that make
them different to us?

00:05:54.092 --> 00:05:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
many different types

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:84%
of species that were evolved
out of the starseed program.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So they were asked to be
the keepers of this data.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
he said to me, this

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.230 align:middle line:84%
is Earth's history,
which means that each one

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.880 align:middle line:84%
of those other planets
has a history as well.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.770 align:middle line:90%
Does it coincide with ours?

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:16.593 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:06:16.593 --> 00:06:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tell me
a little bit more

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.395 align:middle line:84%
about the history of
the Arcturians here.

00:06:19.395 --> 00:06:20.195 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Sure.

00:06:20.195 --> 00:06:24.350 align:middle line:84%
So they back it up to
millions of years ago.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.895 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking 50
million, even past that.

00:06:27.895 --> 00:06:28.695 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:06:28.695 --> 00:06:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: At some
point, they determined

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:84%
that an evolution
needs to occur,

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:84%
which means that you need to
set up another experiment, so

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.660 align:middle line:84%
to speak, and Earth happened
to be elected for that.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.630 align:middle line:84%
At that point, it was
a primordial planet,

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:84%
did not have the
means to support life,

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:84%
and they decided
to terraform it.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And so they--
whatever technology

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.670 align:middle line:84%
they use to terraform
that began to take place.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.110 align:middle line:84%
They don't talk too much about
the terraforming process,

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.040 align:middle line:84%
but it took them some period to
terraform the Earth so that it

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.510 align:middle line:90%
could become a living habitat.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And during that process,
many things had to happen.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So at one point, they
understood that there

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.030 align:middle line:84%
was no tidal control
over the planet,

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:26.330 align:middle line:84%
so we had chaotic weather
and the oceans were--

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.500 align:middle line:90%
they say the oceans were unruly.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And so that led to the
creation of the moon,

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:37.520 align:middle line:84%
and they had the moon brought
in to control the climate

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.330 align:middle line:90%
and tides upon the Earth.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And so they talk about
the fact that there

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.825 align:middle line:84%
were systems put in place to
make this a living habitat.

00:07:44.825 --> 00:07:46.216 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I see.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:49.385 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: And they talked
about the fact that,

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:54.240 align:middle line:84%
do we think oxygen just
exist on the planet

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.170 align:middle line:90%
and it isn't self-contained?

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So they talk about
how that process

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.310 align:middle line:84%
has to be done so that
we can maintain an oxygen

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.150 align:middle line:90%
layer around that.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is all
complicated stuff.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
very proud of what

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.550 align:middle line:90%
they were able to accomplish.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.400 align:middle line:84%
But then it comes to the
matter of, well, OK, you

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.380 align:middle line:84%
have this living environment,
but something has to live in it.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And so then the next process is,
is how do you introduce species

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.020 align:middle line:90%
to an environment?

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.990 align:middle line:84%
So what they talk
about is the fact

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:29.040 align:middle line:84%
that starseeding is
really a process in itself

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.990 align:middle line:90%
because it's an ongoing process.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:38.640 align:middle line:84%
They say what happened is we
brought different species here

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.690 align:middle line:84%
that we had already created as
starseeds to begin that process.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And so they said we
regionalized them,

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.405 align:middle line:84%
which means that they deposited
them all over the Earth.

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:51.405 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I can see that.

00:08:51.405 --> 00:08:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Right, and then
let's see what happens.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Can they survive?

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.230 align:middle line:90%
We do it all the time.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.260 align:middle line:90%
We have fish tanks.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.862 align:middle line:90%
We have zoos.

00:08:58.862 --> 00:09:01.181 align:middle line:90%
Same principle.

00:09:01.181 --> 00:09:03.350 align:middle line:84%
But this started
that process then.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:07.592 align:middle line:84%
And then they said the process
becomes self-sustaining.

00:09:07.592 --> 00:09:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And indeed it has, because
we have 9.2 billion people

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.092 align:middle line:90%
on this planet now.

00:09:12.092 --> 00:09:14.060 align:middle line:90%
So yes, it's very successful.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:19.430 align:middle line:84%
But that's not something that
they looked at in the beginning.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.840 align:middle line:84%
They didn't look at it and say,
we transform this environment

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and we expect this
type of outcome.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:29.210 align:middle line:84%
What they wanted to do was look
at it and say, where will it go?

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:30.980 align:middle line:90%
What will it do?

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:36.790 align:middle line:84%
We are a very immature
species compared

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.240 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the universe.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.840 align:middle line:84%
However, we're
also enterprising.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's
really one of the things

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.228 align:middle line:84%
that they marveled at, is
that they didn't realize

00:09:47.228 --> 00:09:48.270 align:middle line:90%
that would be an outcome.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And to think that they
were behind it the whole time--

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: Indeed, yeah.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.115 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I mean, what
a great accomplishment.

00:09:54.115 --> 00:09:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Yeah, so I
laugh when people say,

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.960 align:middle line:90%
oh, you're the products of apes.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Because the picture's
really way bigger than that.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.840 align:middle line:90%
That is just one process.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And so they sit there
and say, well, over time

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:84%
we introduced new things
to the environment.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And so that becomes a
part of their watching,

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.850 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to
look and see, what

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen with this?

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.760 align:middle line:90%
Is it going to survive?

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Does it become a
dominant species?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Or is it subordinate
to something else?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Or does it have a
symbiotic relationship?

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are all important
things for them to understand.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, is that
they will admit that they are

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:90%
continually reaching out to us.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.170 align:middle line:84%
They're telepathically
connected with us.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And I've had people
say to me all the time,

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.257 align:middle line:84%
sometimes I get these
thoughts in my head.

00:10:48.257 --> 00:10:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And I tell them, I say
it's probably an Arcturian.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.215 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
they're doing, is they're

00:10:52.215 --> 00:10:53.120 align:middle line:90%
reaching out to us.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.080 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to say, we're
conveying knowledge to you,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and they're trying to
get us to the point

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.320 align:middle line:84%
where we understand that,
this is so important to us,

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.430 align:middle line:84%
not only for our survival,
but for our ability

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:10.518 align:middle line:84%
to be out in that
greater cosmic community.

00:11:10.518 --> 00:11:14.600 align:middle line:84%
You want to be able to
go and say, welcome home.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.490 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
be welcomed home,

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.620 align:middle line:84%
you have to be desensitized
to certain things.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And if that desensitivity
might be in the way others

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:84%
look or the way in
which others behave,

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.300 align:middle line:84%
and that's where we
have to be right now,

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.780 align:middle line:84%
is that we're able to
accept those things

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to interact
with it without having paranoia

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.530 align:middle line:84%
or fear or any of
those other things

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.480 align:middle line:84%
that we as humans
tend to possess.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And so this becomes very
much part of their thing,

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to
say, your history

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.970 align:middle line:84%
is very much a part
of who you are.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:53.450 align:middle line:84%
However, your history
is continuing,

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.730 align:middle line:84%
and where you're going
to go with it from here,

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and where I think we're
going to go with it is we're

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.520 align:middle line:84%
going to move back out
into that cosmic community.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How far do you know
back in time of intelligent life

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:09.115 align:middle line:84%
here on planet Earth, like
the Anunnaki, the Nephilim?

00:12:09.115 --> 00:12:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: OK.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:14.310 align:middle line:84%
So of course, this is according
to their records, all right?

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.690 align:middle line:84%
So there's several
instances where they talk

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:20.280 align:middle line:90%
about 150 million years ago.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:26.166 align:middle line:90%
So we do things by epic age.

00:12:26.166 --> 00:12:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So an epic age for them,
though, is different.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.690 align:middle line:84%
We're talking 200,
300 million years.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.335 align:middle line:90%
That's an epic age for them.

00:12:35.335 --> 00:12:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Because they
believe that they've

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.530 align:middle line:84%
been around for
billions of years.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:39.976 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:12:39.976 --> 00:12:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: But when did we
see that becomes the question.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And so they say, really,
at 150 million years,

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:55.850 align:middle line:84%
there's a recognition, which
means that we're capable then

00:12:55.850 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:84%
of recognizing that there's
something that's akin to us,

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:04.510 align:middle line:84%
that there is an intelligence
that is relatable to us.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.700 align:middle line:84%
For Earth, I think
that they're believing

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.820 align:middle line:84%
that it was probably 150
million years ago that we

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.880 align:middle line:90%
started doing that.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Now when we come to the
Anunnaki, so it's an outsider.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a species that came from
another planet, and a very

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.810 align:middle line:90%
territorial species.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.810 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones
that led everybody

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:27.050 align:middle line:84%
to believe that they were gods
because they had technologies,

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.590 align:middle line:84%
technologies that
others didn't have.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:34.762 align:middle line:84%
And they were perfectly
happy holding that spot.

00:13:34.762 --> 00:13:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Because what do we do
when we have a god?

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.560 align:middle line:90%
We devote to it.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:90%
We bow down to it.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.610 align:middle line:90%
We give it whatever it needs.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And for them, that was a perfect
way to be on this planet.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And they did a lot
of genetic testing.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.592 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:13:53.592 --> 00:13:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Because they recognize
that their own species

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.710 align:middle line:90%
was having problems.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Their planet was
dying a slow death.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:90%
That could be the end.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.220 align:middle line:84%
So what are we going to
do to precipitate that?

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.350 align:middle line:84%
We can continue on
with our own species.

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:13.520 align:middle line:84%
So of course, you start
borrowing from other planets,

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.830 align:middle line:84%
trying to proliferate their
own species by doing that.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.280 align:middle line:84%
But like I say, they
also had a mentality

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.270 align:middle line:84%
that was very warring,
very possessing,

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and people began to recognize
that that was problematic.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And so all of the history
about our floods and everything

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.420 align:middle line:84%
is all contributory to
what the Anunnaki did.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, they tried
to wipe the species out

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.250 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, and fortunately,
they were not successful,

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.460 align:middle line:84%
only because one
of the Anunnaki had

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:56.670 align:middle line:84%
become enamored with
the Terrans that he had.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And so then he said,
they have meaning to me.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:90%
I can't just wipe them out.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.687 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise we would
have been back to square one,

00:15:05.687 --> 00:15:06.770 align:middle line:90%
wiped out and start again.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: They still
needed the slaves.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: They still
needed their slaves.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And so that becomes
part of that history,

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:16.960 align:middle line:84%
is that that's their
contribution to the planet.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they left,
and of course, they

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.190 align:middle line:84%
took most of what they put here
with them because we can't have

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:26.360 align:middle line:84%
the locals keeping it because
there's no telling what they'll

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.160 align:middle line:90%
do with it.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.205 align:middle line:90%
So a lot of that--

00:15:28.205 --> 00:15:29.455 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: All that technology--

00:15:29.455 --> 00:15:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: All that
technology, right, right,

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.902 align:middle line:90%
including our pyramids.

00:15:33.902 --> 00:15:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And so they're going to take the
things that operate those away,

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.866 align:middle line:90%
and then you just have stone.

00:15:40.866 --> 00:15:44.376 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What can you tell us
about the Lemurian Holocaust?

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: [CHUCKLES]
OK, so let's say we'll

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.040 align:middle line:90%
talk about the Lemurians here.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:58.002 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So coming from
a larger space colony,

00:15:58.002 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:84%
they went out into the cosmos as
part of that spacefaring group,

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.045 align:middle line:90%
came across Earth.

00:16:07.045 --> 00:16:09.520 align:middle line:90%
This is a perfect atmosphere.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.410 align:middle line:84%
This has everything that
anybody could desire.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:90%
It has living elements upon it.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.110 align:middle line:90%
It has air.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:16.100 align:middle line:90%
It has water.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything
that a species needs.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Right, and so
we have several instances

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.535 align:middle line:90%
where Lemurians were here.

00:16:24.535 --> 00:16:28.450 align:middle line:84%
We had lots of
other civilizations

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:90%
that had colonies here.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.150 align:middle line:84%
But the Lemurians were
a very unique group.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:39.135 align:middle line:84%
They considered
themselves illuminators,

00:16:39.135 --> 00:16:44.140 align:middle line:84%
which means that they were
willing to give others what

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle line:84%
they knew, and in hopes of that
it would enlighten the species.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:10%
And of course, if
you're enlightened,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.476 align:middle line:10%
you're not going to destroy the
planet that you're living on.

00:16:55.476 --> 00:16:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
they were hoping,

00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:00.090 align:middle line:84%
is that in becoming
more enlightened,

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:84%
that we would begin to live
in a different harmony.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.299 align:middle line:84%
Because at one point,
they believed that--

00:17:06.299 --> 00:17:07.880 align:middle line:90%
they didn't call it energy then.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.270 align:middle line:90%
They called it magic.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And they believed that we were
meant to have the magic of life.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:19.079 align:middle line:84%
They believed that it was
for the betterment of all,

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and so what they
were willing to do

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.060 align:middle line:84%
is ensure that everybody
had the same magic.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:84%
But then you have the Anunnaki,
oh, no, no, no, no, you

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.050 align:middle line:90%
can't do that.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:32.490 align:middle line:90%
And so they became a problem.

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:36.870 align:middle line:84%
They were too free-willing
to give to others,

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:40.620 align:middle line:84%
and the Draconians
couldn't have that.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.510 align:middle line:90%
Anunnaki couldn't have that.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:84%
You can't give things
away like that.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.050 align:middle line:84%
You can only have the "elite,"
because that's what they

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:52.770 align:middle line:84%
considered themselves, was to
be the holders of those types

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:53.950 align:middle line:90%
of concepts.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And so they began to plot
against the Lemurians,

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and their intent was to wipe
them off the face of the earth,

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.815 align:middle line:90%
that history would just go away.

00:18:04.815 --> 00:18:06.135 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of that has happened.

00:18:06.135 --> 00:18:07.385 align:middle line:90%
What happened to that history?

00:18:07.385 --> 00:18:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yeah, it's gone.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: I mean, that's what's
happened to most of Earth's

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.110 align:middle line:90%
history, is where did it go?

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.820 align:middle line:84%
But that was always
part of that plan,

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.150 align:middle line:84%
is that if you keep people
from having the history,

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:22.310 align:middle line:90%
then the knowledge goes with it.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.438 align:middle line:84%
And so they began to plot
against the Lemurians,

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:84%
that they would wipe them
off of the face of the Earth,

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:28.530 align:middle line:90%
literally.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that was what they called
the massacre of the Lemurians,

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:34.990 align:middle line:90%
was to be able to do that.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:36.460 align:middle line:90%
The knowledge would be gone.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.600 align:middle line:90%
They would be gone.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And then those that
considered themselves

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:84%
the elites would still
be in charge of what

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:90%
they wanted to be in charge of.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, the Atlantean culture
existed during that same period

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.595 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:52.280 align:middle line:84%
There, again, they
believed the Atlanteans

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:57.560 align:middle line:84%
to be an advanced civilization
that believed that knowledge

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.545 align:middle line:90%
was the key to everything.

00:18:59.545 --> 00:19:00.840 align:middle line:90%
There was some interference.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.380 align:middle line:84%
They had what they
called the Hall of Amenti

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.950 align:middle line:84%
as being the centerpiece
of the Lemurian society.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And the Hall of Amenti was
where the knowledge resided,

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.710 align:middle line:84%
so it would be very
much like that living

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.280 align:middle line:90%
archive for the Arcturians.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.720 align:middle line:90%
They can relate to that.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And they believed that the
entire society of Atlanteans

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:26.340 align:middle line:84%
existed for the propagation
of that knowledge,

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.785 align:middle line:84%
and so that's akin
to Arcturians.

00:19:29.785 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, they
can relate to that,

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:84%
that it is the propagation
of knowledge that

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.670 align:middle line:90%
makes a society who they are.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:36.510 align:middle line:90%
And it was a ship.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:37.510 align:middle line:90%
This is what's so funny.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:41.160 align:middle line:84%
I love when people go, oh, this
piece of land and everything.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:84%
They describe it
totally as a ship,

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:48.880 align:middle line:84%
and that it sat
somewhere in the ocean.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they ever
named where that was.

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:55.710 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, there
was some type of warring

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.270 align:middle line:90%
that was occurring.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
they ever attributed it

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.145 align:middle line:90%
to a specific word.

00:20:01.145 --> 00:20:02.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
period where they

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.020 align:middle line:84%
talk about the electric wars
and different things like that,

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.650 align:middle line:84%
so it may have been
during that period.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:84%
But they talk about how
different civilizations were

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:16.620 align:middle line:84%
being attacked,
and the Atlanteans

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:22.485 align:middle line:84%
were due to leave the
planet, which would--

00:20:22.485 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:84%
we all know that a
ship, if it's that size,

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.786 align:middle line:84%
requires some getting
ready to leave.

00:20:29.786 --> 00:20:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And something
occurred with this--

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.740 align:middle line:84%
we're going to call
them Siriusians.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:36.603 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Siriusians?

00:20:36.603 --> 00:20:42.884 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Right, from Sirius B,
who were the original Egyptians.

00:20:42.884 --> 00:20:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And something occurred with
them in which they were still

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:52.150 align:middle line:84%
trying to work out some deal
with the Atlanteans because

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:57.980 align:middle line:84%
of Thoth, and that
delayed their takeoff.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, what
it said in their record

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.780 align:middle line:90%
is that the ship was sunk.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You mentioned
the original Egyptians.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: So their
records indicate

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.470 align:middle line:84%
that the Siriusians from Sirius
B were the original Egyptians.

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen pictures
of them, and a lot of them

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:18.218 align:middle line:90%
have that very classic look.

00:21:18.218 --> 00:21:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And they came here just
like everybody else did.

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:90%
This was a way station.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:29.035 align:middle line:84%
They set up whole colonies,
and they were doing trading.

00:21:29.035 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Because they had technology,
they were considered to be gods.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the thing.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Show somebody some technology
that they don't have,

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.710 align:middle line:90%
and you're suddenly elevated.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what happened,
is they were elevated.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Now in somewhere
in there, then we

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.910 align:middle line:84%
have Osiris that shows
up, who is not from Sirius

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:50.240 align:middle line:90%
B, different skin tone.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.750 align:middle line:90%
He had more the green.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.505 align:middle line:90%
They had more the blue color.

00:21:54.505 --> 00:21:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't mean
that they both didn't

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.760 align:middle line:84%
have a copper-based
blood, but what

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.860 align:middle line:84%
it means is that their
suns were different.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And so he-- what
we're assuming is

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:10.250 align:middle line:84%
that he was more from
some area like Orion

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:16.290 align:middle line:84%
or somewhere where that
green-colored skin comes from.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And he entered the scene
and different technologies,

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and his technology superseded
what the Egyptians had.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And so we had a
change in who was

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.532 align:middle line:84%
in charge then because that's
the way it works amongst them.

00:22:32.532 --> 00:22:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And so everything was
good until here comes Set.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:44.140 align:middle line:84%
There again, Sirius B.
And he was not happy

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.640 align:middle line:84%
that his territory
had been moved into,

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.790 align:middle line:90%
so that erupted into a huge war.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.850 align:middle line:90%
And they recount that.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.190 align:middle line:84%
They talk about the
fires in the sky.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:58.600 align:middle line:84%
They talk about the
glass land, meaning

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.244 align:middle line:90%
that the sand was vitrified.

00:23:01.244 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle line:84%
So we know the violence that was
taking place during that point.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.990 align:middle line:84%
That becomes very
important to the history,

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:12.430 align:middle line:84%
is that here was this warring
faction for power going on

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:84%
during that time,
and they finally

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.350 align:middle line:90%
were able to get rid of Osiris.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.460 align:middle line:90%
We'll never know that.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.140 align:middle line:84%
But it sounded-- based
on their history,

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:28.000 align:middle line:84%
it sounded like he had
at least put things

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.940 align:middle line:84%
in place that were for
the benefit of the people.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that
that was Set's intention,

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.270 align:middle line:90%
based on what history says.

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:41.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're still condoning
actions, just like we do today,

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.560 align:middle line:84%
that lack of understanding of
what really needs to transpire

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.100 align:middle line:90%
is not there.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.740 align:middle line:84%
But they had a very violent
history during that time.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:53.180 align:middle line:84%
The Anunnaki tended
to stay out of what

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.610 align:middle line:84%
was happening with Sirius
B because they didn't

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.415 align:middle line:90%
want to go up against them.

00:23:57.415 --> 00:24:02.420 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about two species
that are very much similar, very

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.800 align:middle line:84%
much have a state of who
they are, very much as

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.290 align:middle line:84%
capable of warring against
each other at the same level.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:12.840 align:middle line:84%
So they weren't going
to take each other on.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:84%
History says that they were akin
to like understanding, which

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.090 align:middle line:84%
means that they understood
what the other could do

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:23.700 align:middle line:90%
and better left that untouched.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of what the
Arcturians are saying

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:84%
is that that in itself
was an observation,

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.980 align:middle line:84%
that they had enough
knowledge to understand

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:37.020 align:middle line:84%
that there's some things you
should not go up against.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And so that happened to
be one of those areas.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where are Arcturians
in relation to humans now

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.460 align:middle line:90%
and looking into the future?

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Well, they've
really gone out of their way

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.640 align:middle line:90%
to be in contact with us.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:58.386 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, Koh Ni Dah was
very personable with us,

00:24:58.386 --> 00:25:01.740 align:middle line:84%
was very much
trying to teach us,

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.825 align:middle line:84%
and I think that that's
really their goal--

00:25:03.825 --> 00:25:04.625 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes.

00:25:04.625 --> 00:25:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: --is to be able
to teach us that you belong

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.170 align:middle line:90%
to something much larger.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine feeling like
you're just this small dot that

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.850 align:middle line:84%
has no purpose,
and then realizing

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:21.700 align:middle line:84%
that you're part of the whole
picture that has purpose?

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
they've tried to tell us,

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:30.030 align:middle line:84%
is that you've forgotten
really about your connection

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.120 align:middle line:90%
to the universe.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a lot of what
they've been trying to teach us,

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.340 align:middle line:84%
is relive that connection
with the universe,

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:40.100 align:middle line:84%
relive all the knowledge
that's around you.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.100 align:middle line:90%
You hold all the keys.

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he said that to
me over and over again.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.500 align:middle line:90%
You have the keys.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.500 align:middle line:90%
You just don't use them.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a huge
statement in itself.

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.730 align:middle line:84%
That's like telling
somebody, you know the truth,

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.700 align:middle line:84%
and yet you fail to
recognize the truth.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.783 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, you're not
telling anyone about it.

00:25:56.783 --> 00:26:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Right, and so what
he's trying to do was lead us.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
collectively, since he's

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:03.910 align:middle line:84%
part of that collective,
what he's doing is

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:05.800 align:middle line:84%
he's stating exactly
what all of them

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.800 align:middle line:84%
are saying collectively,
that we need

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.690 align:middle line:84%
to become part of the
universe that we are part of

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:15.910 align:middle line:84%
and to recognize that everything
we think, act, do, and say

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:18.470 align:middle line:90%
has an effect on that universe.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And because, really,
of all of them,

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:25.220 align:middle line:84%
they recognize that so much,
their impact on the universe.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why
this crystal city is

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.010 align:middle line:84%
so important to
them because it's

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:36.180 align:middle line:84%
like the perfect tone of
environment in the universe.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And what they're trying to tell
us is you too need to be that.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:43.170 align:middle line:84%
In the scheme of things, we're
far greater than we know,

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.490 align:middle line:84%
that we belong to
a bigger picture,

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:48.430 align:middle line:84%
and that bigger picture
is going to lead us home.

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:51.240 align:middle line:84%
It's going to lead
us to that knowledge

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.120 align:middle line:84%
level that's going to tell us
exactly what our purpose is.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I really think that
that's the future that they're

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.545 align:middle line:84%
trying to show us, and I think
that they've done a good job.

00:27:01.545 --> 00:27:05.220 align:middle line:84%
My entire group has
learned something so much

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.680 align:middle line:84%
from getting to
know this conclave

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.060 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that we are
something more than just

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.370 align:middle line:90%
this physical human being.

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, it's a
very beautiful message.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>WHITNEY: I think so too.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.835 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, Victoria, thank
you for being on the show.

00:27:19.835 --> 00:27:21.585 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITNEY: Oh, well,
thanks for having me.

00:27:21.585 --> 00:27:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.680 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
