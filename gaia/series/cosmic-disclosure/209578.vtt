00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.090 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.890 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.830 align:middle line:10%
we are with David Adair, a
space technology consultant,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.840 align:middle line:10%
and a retired field
officer from the Office

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.130 align:middle line:10%
of Naval Intelligence.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.860 align:middle line:10%
Also joining us is
Tim, a tactical advisor

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.560 align:middle line:10%
to covert analysts trying
to understand the missions

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.710 align:middle line:10%
and strategies of non-human
intelligences on our planet.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Welcome gentlemen.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, from
your communications

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:84%
with the Greys and
Being 6, what did you

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.290 align:middle line:84%
learn about their
ancient technologies,

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.070 align:middle line:90%
and how far did they go back?

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.080 align:middle line:84%
What we've done is
a field experiment

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.860 align:middle line:84%
where we try to communicate
with a version of the universe

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.870 align:middle line:84%
in a higher
frequency, which means

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.730 align:middle line:84%
it's a more experienced
version of this universe.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And by compressing
the frequencies,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.210 align:middle line:84%
we were able to communicate
with this version of us, which

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:84%
is not a temporal line, but
it's more a line of experience.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's basically
meant by Being 6.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So what we've learned, one
of the oldest technologies--

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.115 align:middle line:84%
and it's getting a
bit non-linear here-

00:01:26.115 --> 00:01:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure, right.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Because time
is something that

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.860 align:middle line:84%
stands in relation
to the observer,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.730 align:middle line:84%
which means everyone who has a
viewpoint in a temporal sense

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:84%
can have a different
perception of time.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.015 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Very well put, yes.

00:01:41.015 --> 00:01:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So what we've
learned from Being 6

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.530 align:middle line:84%
is that one of the oldest
technologies that we see

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.760 align:middle line:84%
from their viewpoint is
basically, for example,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids, which is from
our side of inside of time

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.160 align:middle line:84%
seems to be like a
monumental structure.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.970 align:middle line:84%
But from their
perspective, it's something

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.180 align:middle line:84%
that has an equivalent outside
of time and inside of time.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So you don't only have
the pyramids in that way,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.400 align:middle line:84%
but you also have in a reverse
opposite non-temporal sense,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:84%
a reverse pyramid
that overlays that.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And through that-- and
it's a bit complicated.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:84%
But through that,
the universe itself

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.600 align:middle line:84%
is able to observe what's
happening in this field,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.940 align:middle line:90%
in this point of the universe.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Being 6 told us that
the universe at a higher

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.400 align:middle line:84%
frequency and a higher
viewpoint is actually

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.320 align:middle line:90%
looking for paradoxes.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And what it's seeing
here is actually

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.020 align:middle line:84%
what we could define
as duality, which

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.030 align:middle line:84%
means the philosophical but
also technical problem of what

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:90%
is you, I, and everything else.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Being 6 stated that it needed
the pyramids in order--

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and it plays on different
planets as well in order

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.495 align:middle line:90%
to make this reality observable.

00:03:08.495 --> 00:03:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: David, you had powerful
insights from ancient tech.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.390 align:middle line:84%
What can you tell us about
your experiences Area 51?

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID ADAIR: Well, the
entity that I've dealt with

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and still do live
with, it's old.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.730 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing that they're
even on a linear line.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:34.810 align:middle line:84%
You realize I've had this thing
with me for about 45 years.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.730 align:middle line:84%
So in time, little, short
bursts of conversation

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.290 align:middle line:84%
to get them all strung together,
it's quite a bit of stuff.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first things I
was reminded in an abrupt way,

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.890 align:middle line:84%
she said not everybody runs
on a Julius Caesar calendar.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And there was an
argument about that

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.470 align:middle line:84%
because time is to us is so
linear where a creature lives

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.770 align:middle line:90%
on a chronological timeline.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.410 align:middle line:90%
You're 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And she was trying to tell
me that that's really rare.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.690 align:middle line:84%
We didn't even think
such creatures existed

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.690 align:middle line:90%
that could live like that.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.190 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting there, and I'm
like, well, how do you do it?

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.920 align:middle line:90%
And they're unstuck in time.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:84%
They can go forwards,
backwards, present.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:90%
They live in all the moments.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, God,
my, I'd be lost.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.970 align:middle line:84%
She said being a
human you would be.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Did she ever mentioned
the evolution of where

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.370 align:middle line:90%
she had originated from?

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean were they
once maybe 3D humans?

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I asked her over
the course of the time.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't respond to
questions immediately.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.340 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Like she explained to me,
she's waiting for her family

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.310 align:middle line:90%
to come and get her.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.285 align:middle line:90%
I went, what?

00:05:01.285 --> 00:05:03.230 align:middle line:90%
What did you just say?

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, she goes, when you
have a downed pilot, how

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.140 align:middle line:90%
long does it take you to go in?

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.370 align:middle line:90%
It's instant.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:90%
We're don't scramble.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.890 align:middle line:90%
We go.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:84%
We go get him in
the day if we can.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, she said the
same thing with us.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.100 align:middle line:84%
I said, it's been 45
years not everybody runs

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:84%
on Julius Caesar
calendar, David.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.330 align:middle line:84%
What might be 45 years to
you is only a day to us.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.460 align:middle line:90%
Well, how old are you guys?

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's in your years,
it's in the billions.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.020 align:middle line:84%
I went, the universe is
only known-- known universe

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.700 align:middle line:90%
for about 15 billion.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we're about 13.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.540 align:middle line:84%
So you've been hanging
around for a while?

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.770 align:middle line:84%
She said, how do you
think I got to Earth?

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.090 align:middle line:90%
I've been meaning to ask that.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.880 align:middle line:90%
How did you get here?

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:84%
There was a war going on
between light and dark.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And she takes a blast from
this in the side of the ship

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and penetrates all the
way into her engine

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.250 align:middle line:84%
area, which I told you
the blaster looked at,

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.990 align:middle line:90%
and down they come.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, she landed in what
she said was a big bowl.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle line:90%
And she settled there, came in.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.440 align:middle line:90%
She said, well, why Earth?

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.410 align:middle line:84%
She goes, where are
you in the galaxy?

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're on the
very outer edge.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So that'd be the first
thing you come into.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.300 align:middle line:84%
She said yeah, so I slid
in this big bowl, which I

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.760 align:middle line:90%
think you call the Great Basin.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.120 align:middle line:84%
I went, Lord, mercy, that's
600 million years ago.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And she goes yeah, I
sat there all that time.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And then these crazy guys in
the blue suits came through.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.930 align:middle line:84%
They were digging a tunnel for
some kind of base, found me.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And I went, Lord,
have mercy, to--

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.990 align:middle line:84%
been here for several
of your years.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.240 align:middle line:84%
But they're not getting
anywhere with anything.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.470 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going [SCRATCHES HEAD].

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.430 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, my brain
is shorting out here.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.470 align:middle line:90%
It can only take so much.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.630 align:middle line:84%
She said, I want
to go to Georgia.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:05.630 align:middle line:90%
We're in North Carolina.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.630 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, what
are we going to see?

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.710 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see the
Georgia Guidestones.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Do you know the
people who built that?

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.480 align:middle line:90%
She goes, that's another story.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.630 align:middle line:84%
But she said that I want to go
down there before they're gone.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:90%
One of them has been dynamited.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.560 align:middle line:90%
They ain't there no more.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Who built them?

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: We don't know.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Oh, OK.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They've tried
and tried to find out.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And the right wing
down there believes

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.660 align:middle line:84%
it's satanic and
devils and should

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.800 align:middle line:84%
be destroyed, which
actually what it's proposing

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.230 align:middle line:90%
all sounds good to me.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.640 align:middle line:84%
We've got too many
numbers on this planet.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.200 align:middle line:90%
8 billion is too much.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.430 align:middle line:84%
This planet's only designed
for at least three.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
kill its resources,

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.540 align:middle line:90%
just can't drain it to death.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.090 align:middle line:84%
But we went down and looked
at the Georgia Guidestones

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.770 align:middle line:90%
before they got blown up.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.550 align:middle line:84%
She said, I want you to
take me on down to Conyers

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.530 align:middle line:84%
to a place called
Rock Eagle Park.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, where are
you getting all this?

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.960 align:middle line:90%
Just do it.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.790 align:middle line:90%
So we get down there.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And I go down this Rock
Eagle Park, and I go--

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.310 align:middle line:84%
she is, let's ask the question,
why is it called Rock Eagle?

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.733 align:middle line:90%
OK, why is it?

00:08:13.733 --> 00:08:14.900 align:middle line:90%
So we go over this monument.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.560 align:middle line:90%
There's this big tower.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.950 align:middle line:90%
And we go up this tower, which--

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.200 align:middle line:84%
this is years, decades
ago I was there.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.600 align:middle line:84%
We got to the top of
the tower, looked down,

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:84%
and what looked like a
bunch of rocks on the ground

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.130 align:middle line:90%
is a big eagle.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:30.945 align:middle line:84%
She says, now, go down
and read the sign.

00:08:30.945 --> 00:08:32.980 align:middle line:90%
So I go down, read the sign.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:33.880 align:middle line:90%
And it says--

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.070 align:middle line:90%
I memorized it.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Tread softly here, white man,
cause long before ye ever

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:44.010 align:middle line:84%
came strange races fought,
loved, and died here.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.320 align:middle line:90%
She said that's how I got here.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there going,
this is thousands of years old.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.680 align:middle line:84%
They don't even know
where it originated from.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.050 align:middle line:84%
She says, well, I
was here before it.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:59.940 align:middle line:84%
It's Paleozoic years,
trilobites, 600 million years,

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.740 align:middle line:90%
I guess you were.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's just kind of
hard to deal with--

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.430 align:middle line:84%
stuff that comes out of there
is just a matter of fact,

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.380 align:middle line:84%
but it just drops
you in your chair

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.250 align:middle line:84%
because you realize this is
so beyond your understanding.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is the moon considered
ancient technology, Dave?

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.055 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.055 --> 00:09:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: That's a whole
thing in itself, our moon.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:84%
I can sit here, and I
can drag out a blackboard

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:38.340 align:middle line:84%
and show you mathematically
this body Earth

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.900 align:middle line:84%
does not have the gravitational
mass to capture a moon that big

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:43.890 align:middle line:90%
and hold it.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And then not only
hold it, hold it

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.200 align:middle line:84%
in a tidal lock where
it can't even rotate.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.120 align:middle line:90%
That's nuts.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.150 align:middle line:90%
It can't do it.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.820 align:middle line:90%
But there it is.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.410 align:middle line:84%
There's also if you check with
Cherokee and the Hopi Indians,

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.800 align:middle line:84%
they have history
before white man ever

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:07.410 align:middle line:84%
showed up of moonless nights,
meaning the moon wasn't there.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.460 align:middle line:84%
It just showed up one
time, which I always

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.220 align:middle line:84%
suspected that there's
something about our moon, man,

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.490 align:middle line:90%
is just not normal.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you telling me
it's moving under its own steam?

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I think it was
parked here like an RV.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.440 align:middle line:90%
Somebody drove it here.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Then there's Neil Armstrong
and all his stuff.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:30.840 align:middle line:84%
They put seismographs
and plotters on the moon.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.750 align:middle line:84%
That was the first thing they
set out in their instruments.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Then they got up and fired
the upper section back

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.320 align:middle line:90%
into the moon.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.890 align:middle line:84%
When it crashed, the moon
resonated like a bell.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:43.480 align:middle line:90%
And it rang for hours.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Then in the final
mission, the Apollo 16,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.960 align:middle line:84%
I think, they put rockets
on the ascent engine.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Drove it into the
moon really hard.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.490 align:middle line:90%
It rang for like three days.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's great.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I wonder how the people inside
the moon appreciate that.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's the point--

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.280 align:middle line:90%
that's what Pitholem asked me.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I went, oh, God, I didn't
even think about that.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:07.880 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
be too happy about it.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And then ancient
technology, she said,

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:84%
you've been throwing stuff
at the moon since the '50s.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, lunar Rover,
lunar Ranger, they

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:84%
would fly in and
do a hard impact.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.810 align:middle line:84%
They were taking photos of where
we could have a landing site.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:30.150 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, do you realize
you left 400,000 pounds of junk

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.030 align:middle line:90%
on the moon?

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.880 align:middle line:84%
She goes there's 96
bags of feces up there.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Astronauts had to go somewhere,
and they tossed it out.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.540 align:middle line:84%
So imagine if you live inside
the moon, and up on your roof,

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:47.820 align:middle line:84%
you've got somebody drop
400,000 pounds of junk.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Left it everywhere,
and you're saying

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.890 align:middle line:84%
I want to come
back here and live.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, you walk over to
them to-- at Crater's Edge,

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and you tell them,
well, guys, glad

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.300 align:middle line:90%
you're enjoying the moon here.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Grab you some rock samples,
grab you some dust,

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.535 align:middle line:84%
then pack your
stuff up and leave

00:12:04.535 --> 00:12:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and don't ever come
back here again.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And Neil had something
to say about that.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So this is all
ancient technology.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the moon is
really ancient.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.430 align:middle line:84%
It's packing a lot of
knowledge in its existence.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
anything about it.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And what did you hear from NASA
for years and years and years?

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Go to Mars, go to
Mars, go to Mars.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever said anything
about going back to the moon.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Mars is 42 million
miles one way.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.885 align:middle line:84%
Take a year to get
there, and don't even

00:12:34.885 --> 00:12:37.380 align:middle line:84%
know if you can walk
when you get there.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.365 align:middle line:84%
The moon is only
240,000 miles away.

00:12:40.365 --> 00:12:43.530 align:middle line:84%
You get there in three
days with chemical rockets.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.097 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to the moon.

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we know everything
about the moon.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.500 align:middle line:90%
Oh, do you really?

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:53.480 align:middle line:84%
If you would take the area you
explored with the 6 landings,

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.030 align:middle line:84%
coupled with the lunar
rovers running around,

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.130 align:middle line:84%
you haven't even
explored an area

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:04.170 align:middle line:84%
the size of the parking lot of
Mall of America in Minnesota.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Compare that to the continent of
North America times 2 backside.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:14.860 align:middle line:84%
That's all you know about
it, size of a parking lot.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:90%
How much have you seen?

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.440 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we're supposed
to believe we're done,

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.308 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to go on to Mars.

00:13:21.308 --> 00:13:23.350 align:middle line:84%
No, there's something
going on with the moon they

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.560 align:middle line:90%
don't want us to know about.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.180 align:middle line:84%
They, meaning the
government, NASA, whoever.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And then NASA, I saw
a tape not long ago,

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.800 align:middle line:84%
got a thing up there that looks
like the St. Louis bridge.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.670 align:middle line:84%
But instead of 1,100
feet, it's three miles.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:middle line:90%
And what is it made of?

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you got a thing,
it looks like a radar dish,

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and a cannon barrel
sticking out.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:90%
What is that stuff made of?

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.290 align:middle line:90%
It's smooth.

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.080 align:middle line:90%
It's metallic-looking.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And NASA will not even send any
probes to look at these thing.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:01.507 align:middle line:84%
So as you know, I'm
going to Middle East.

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:90%
I want to start a space program.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Got a budget big
enough to do it.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm going back to the moon.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And the first place I'm landing,
every one of those places

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.930 align:middle line:84%
that NASA said don't land,
that's where we're going.

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:14.958 align:middle line:90%
And we'll land drones on it.

00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.250 align:middle line:90%
And they'll be detailed enough.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.800 align:middle line:84%
If there's a door knob on
it, we'll see the door knob.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.900 align:middle line:84%
But what are these
things laying on that--

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.472 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Site.

00:14:22.472 --> 00:14:24.778 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Somebody
should look at them.

00:14:24.778 --> 00:14:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tim, what do
you think about that?

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: So basically, I
have two opinions on that.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:33.950 align:middle line:84%
So we asked the Greys about
the moon as well as Being 6.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And they both have very
different viewpoints

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.910 align:middle line:90%
on the significance of the moon.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And I confirm you're
absolutely right that it's not

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.315 align:middle line:90%
a natural occurring body.

00:14:47.315 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It's not.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.750 align:middle line:90%
And you called it parked.

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And basically, that's
what the Greys said.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So the one opinion from Being
6, from their viewpoint,

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle line:84%
which is more zoomed
out of this reality,

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.740 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of hard to grasp.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.820 align:middle line:84%
But they say it's a
way in order to create

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.570 align:middle line:84%
a certain tube between
the sun and the Earth,

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.770 align:middle line:84%
which is the reason why
the moon and the sun

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.950 align:middle line:84%
align in the exact
same size of it.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And it creates such
a feedback field

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:84%
that between the sun as the
expression of the source where

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.570 align:middle line:84%
we all come from, which in
this version of the universe

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.120 align:middle line:84%
is light basically,
is being reflected

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.530 align:middle line:84%
so that the Earth in
itself in the middle of it

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:37.970 align:middle line:90%
can sustain life.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And it creates a field
where we are basically

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:49.010 align:middle line:84%
denaturalized and blocked
away from getting back

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.110 align:middle line:90%
into super consciousness.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So we have-- we can
experience this duality.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:58.820 align:middle line:84%
So this is basically the answer
that we got from Being 6.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And both indicate that the
significance of the moon

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.020 align:middle line:90%
is huge.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.190 align:middle line:84%
So the Greys called
the key to ascension.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:14.540 align:middle line:84%
They said it's a technology,
a craft, which they indicated

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.680 align:middle line:84%
came from somewhere in,
I guess, Andromeda galaxy

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:84%
or something, because from their
viewpoint, all life on Earth

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.960 align:middle line:84%
is basically more or
less like an experiment.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's been raised, and it--

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:34.010 align:middle line:84%
the moon creates the
cycles that is necessary

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:37.175 align:middle line:84%
in order to have sustainable
life forms on the planet.

00:16:37.175 --> 00:16:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you saying this is
an extraterrestrial technology

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:44.000 align:middle line:84%
that creates a finite
for humans to survive?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: It's creating a
sort of a sustainable

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:51.270 align:middle line:84%
field where life is possible
in order to perceive itself.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So that is basically the
answer that we got back.

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Holy scriptures and
cultures around the world

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:84%
depict these anomalous
phenomena coming out

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.890 align:middle line:84%
from the skies, the
heavens, they say.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.427 align:middle line:90%
What would you say about that?

00:17:05.427 --> 00:17:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: When there's
that much smoke,

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.859 align:middle line:90%
there's the fire somewhere.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:12.780 align:middle line:84%
There's some hard
realities to this stuff.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.560 align:middle line:84%
There's so many things that's
referenced in scriptures,

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have any
today's examples of.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:90%
What I found amazing is about--

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:28.250 align:middle line:84%
in the scriptures, the people
that witnessed all the stuff,

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.470 align:middle line:84%
and they had to see
it multiple times.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Brother, just one
would be enough for me.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.750 align:middle line:90%
I'd be a believer.

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Oceans part, and they
let you walk through.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:38.510 align:middle line:90%
That will do it.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Yep, yep, there's
something up there.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:42.300 align:middle line:90%
Something's going on.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.992 align:middle line:90%
And we just almost like--

00:17:44.992 --> 00:17:46.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
ignorance or we just

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.680 align:middle line:84%
refuse to believe
it, because it'll

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.895 align:middle line:84%
challenge you to think
so far outside your box.

00:17:52.895 --> 00:17:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And plus
back then, they

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.320 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the definitions
and descriptions.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.080 align:middle line:84%
That's why they would
do artwork or carvings.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Well, in
related terms to them.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.720 align:middle line:10%
Erich Von Daniken did a
good job of explaining that.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:10%
Well, they say chariots
might have been spacecrafts.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.850 align:middle line:90%
Today, we'd say spacecraft.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.470 align:middle line:90%
Back then, they'd say chariots.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.940 align:middle line:84%
There's so much unknown
stuff in our history.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:23.040 align:middle line:84%
It's hundreds of thousands
of years just blank.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
happened, lost history.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:30.452 align:middle line:84%
Then you run into
forbidden archaeology.

00:18:30.452 --> 00:18:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And I used to laugh
at that until I

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:90%
started looking at some of it.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.330 align:middle line:90%
And folks, I can't explain it.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.330 align:middle line:84%
How do you have a
hammer laying there?

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.760 align:middle line:90%
The head is cast iron.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.390 align:middle line:84%
The wooden handle is
so old it's petrified.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Who in God's name was pouring
iron back in casting hammerhead

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.290 align:middle line:90%
50,000 years ago?

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: During the
Jurassic, right?

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, like
Og, the cavemen,

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.940 align:middle line:84%
had a smelt going
on in his cave.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.290 align:middle line:90%
None of this is making sense.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.260 align:middle line:90%
But there it is.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.340 align:middle line:90%
And you're looking at it.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.110 align:middle line:84%
You're not even allowed
to talk about it.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.380 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
red flag for me,

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:17.330 align:middle line:84%
is when authorities
of your time won't

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.730 align:middle line:84%
let you even talk
about something,

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:20.930 align:middle line:90%
there's something up then.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:22.730 align:middle line:90%
What do you think, Tim?

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.635 align:middle line:84%
Do you have anything
to add to that?

00:19:24.635 --> 00:19:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: What I think that--

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:31.070 align:middle line:84%
there's absolute truth
to it that if you compare

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:35.210 align:middle line:84%
many civilizations around
the globe and their history,

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.450 align:middle line:84%
you can see that they
all speak about people

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:39.860 align:middle line:90%
coming from the stars.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.140 align:middle line:84%
They have the
connection to the stars.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.730 align:middle line:90%
You can see that with the Hopi.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I guess you mentioned
them, right?

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:51.410 align:middle line:84%
So we have that in the
Germanic tribe culture.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.710 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the people
that come in from the stars

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:58.490 align:middle line:90%
and being superior beings.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And from that,
derives the word ace.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:06.230 align:middle line:84%
So we still say if someone
is literally a star,

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.480 align:middle line:84%
then we say like,
hey, he's an ace.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.410 align:middle line:84%
He's some flying
ace or something.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So that links to this
species, whoever they were.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.670 align:middle line:84%
So we have lots and
lots of evidence

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:24.740 align:middle line:84%
that cultures have been in
contact with civilizations that

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.150 align:middle line:90%
were coming from the stars.

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.100 align:middle line:84%
But we also have this
interesting effect,

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.390 align:middle line:84%
which is coming
into existence when

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.810 align:middle line:84%
we interact with species
or life forms that

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:40.370 align:middle line:84%
are in a higher frequencial
level of existence

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:44.390 align:middle line:84%
that we have surreal
effects on reality.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So because our
consciousness is constantly

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.480 align:middle line:84%
projecting outside and
inside information,

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.620 align:middle line:84%
and we are creating why
we're perceiving on the way.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So basically, something
that could be super surreal

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.670 align:middle line:84%
and something that
could appear in the sky

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:06.470 align:middle line:84%
can be manifested in
quite a literal way

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:11.840 align:middle line:84%
if enough observable
consciousness units project

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.070 align:middle line:90%
this thing into existence.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:16.590 align:middle line:84%
So reality would
respond to that.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Right.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.223 align:middle line:84%
I like what you said
about their perception,

00:21:19.223 --> 00:21:21.350 align:middle line:84%
because it's through
different timelines

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:24.650 align:middle line:84%
and different civilizations
of how someone would look

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.540 align:middle line:90%
at something from the heavens.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Many researchers say that
the Ark of the Covenant

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:33.890 align:middle line:84%
is an actual technology because
of its radioactive properties.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:35.420 align:middle line:90%
What do you guys think?

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: We need to get hold
of the thing and find out.

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:41.330 align:middle line:90%
That's me.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:42.680 align:middle line:90%
That's the science in me.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.523 align:middle line:84%
Touch it, feel it,
grab hold on it.

00:21:45.523 --> 00:21:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if you grab hold of
that thing, you'll drop dead.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:51.140 align:middle line:84%
There's something
up with all that.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, an
awful lot of smoke,

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.830 align:middle line:90%
got to be a fire somewhere.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:59.030 align:middle line:10%
And the description
they gave was amazing.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.970 align:middle line:84%
If written thousands
of years ago--

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and it sounds like somebody
had written it post-Japan

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:09.140 align:middle line:84%
of radiation burns,
radiation sickness,

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:13.790 align:middle line:84%
hair and teeth falling
out, burns from--

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:84%
no flame, but from
something else.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
that's pretty clear.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.150 align:middle line:84%
That's an ancient
technology that's

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:26.690 align:middle line:84%
having to be interpreted
in our today's terms.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:29.900 align:middle line:84%
But God knows what
else is laying out

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.880 align:middle line:84%
there, the things we
hadn't even seen yet.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And there is stuff still buried
that we haven't found yet.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.000 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.145 align:middle line:84%
I know as soon as
I'm sitting here.

00:22:40.145 --> 00:22:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There's technology
too that surrounds that.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:43.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
want to get into-

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: It does.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.275 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Some of the projects
that we're working on right

00:22:46.275 --> 00:22:49.715 align:middle line:84%
now, you and I. And to see
the energy fields around these

00:22:49.715 --> 00:22:50.515 align:middle line:90%
technologies-

00:22:50.515 --> 00:22:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: And it's real.

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.432 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That are
extraterrestrial is

00:22:52.432 --> 00:22:54.100 align:middle line:90%
real and measurable.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And that's
the thing about--

00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:00.310 align:middle line:84%
we think it's radiation,
hair and teeth falling out

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.450 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.150 align:middle line:84%
But what would if you put
a Geiger counter on it,

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:05.330 align:middle line:90%
you get nothing?

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, that means it's not real?

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:09.790 align:middle line:84%
No, it means your Geiger
counter can't read it.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:14.110 align:middle line:84%
It's in some other form, and
it's-- but the human body is

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:16.040 align:middle line:90%
reacting to it.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:20.530 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I wouldn't just be
smug people saying, well,

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.060 align:middle line:84%
you can't get a
radiation reading.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not there.

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.562 align:middle line:10%
Well yeah, you want to go over
there and put your life on it?

00:23:25.562 --> 00:23:28.690 align:middle line:10%
Go step out there, and when
you glow in the dark tonight,

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:29.750 align:middle line:10%
I'll tell you about it.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There are many
remote viewers out there

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.300 align:middle line:84%
who have remote viewed of
the Ark of the Covenant

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and see this pulse of
energy emanating from it.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.285 align:middle line:90%
What do you think that is?

00:23:40.285 --> 00:23:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I have no
idea, other than it's

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:46.900 align:middle line:84%
a technology we
are to learn yet.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.780 align:middle line:90%


00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:84%
I get irritated
with physicists who

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:55.940 align:middle line:84%
tell me that our atomic
code is absolute.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:59.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, man, what rock
have you been living under?

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:04.060 align:middle line:84%
I said, you're telling me
that 123 elements we got,

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.850 align:middle line:84%
whatever the number
is, that's it?

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:84%
We're lucky to have volume
1 of an entire encyclopedia

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:11.410 align:middle line:90%
of elements.

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.090 align:middle line:84%
We just haven't
went out far enough

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:15.280 align:middle line:90%
to find the other elements.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.880 align:middle line:84%
There very well may be
a dilithium crystal.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.082 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:24:21.082 --> 00:24:25.060 align:middle line:10%
As far as crystals go,
from what ancient contacts

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.710 align:middle line:10%
we seem to have
had with them, they

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:middle line:10%
seem to pack a
pretty good punch.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.150 align:middle line:84%
There's something going
on with that crowd.

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Just like I said, we
need to get hold of it,

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:38.770 align:middle line:84%
drag it out and look at it, and
stop forbidden technologies,

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:39.700 align:middle line:90%
forbidden not--

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.170 align:middle line:84%
man, what is wrong with
that, with everything?

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It should
all be available.

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Assume it's real.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, if it's real, guess what?

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:50.640 align:middle line:84%
That's Gods cell phone,
and it's still running.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Imagine what kind of phone calls
you can make on that thing?

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:55.640 align:middle line:90%
You want to call God?

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Stuff like that, just--
yeah, let's jump into it

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:01.010 align:middle line:90%
and see if it is real.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:03.410 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
people are afraid of it

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.750 align:middle line:84%
and they should be
because that means

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:08.920 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the things you've
been dismissing might be real.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.210 align:middle line:84%
All these people who
see UFOs, and everybody

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:12.230 align:middle line:90%
makes fun of them.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:14.780 align:middle line:90%
Well, it ain't funny anymore.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.280 align:middle line:84%
There's just been
too much evidence.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.197 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: There are real.

00:25:17.197 --> 00:25:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: You got better evidence
of UFOs existing than you

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.980 align:middle line:90%
do that Christ existed.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, people might strike me
down and smite that devil,

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.170 align:middle line:90%
but it's the truth.

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And yet, 2000 years later,
Jesus is still here,

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.450 align:middle line:90%
UFOs are still here.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:34.980 align:middle line:10%
Simply because you
don't believe it,

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.350 align:middle line:10%
doesn't mean it's not there.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So these other
avatars on our planet

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:46.050 align:middle line:84%
that we look up to like Krishna,
Jesus, do you think these

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:48.060 align:middle line:90%
are actual extraterrestrials?

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: I'll answer it
on a historical level.

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:55.800 align:middle line:84%
We used-- for the longest time
didn't think Troy ever existed.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.480 align:middle line:90%
We not only found Troy.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.030 align:middle line:84%
We found seven Troys
where it's been

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:02.310 align:middle line:84%
burnt down, built up,
burnt down, built up,

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:03.720 align:middle line:90%
seven times in a row.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere on the
fifth or sixth level,

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:08.490 align:middle line:90%
they found this set of jewelry.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Guess who it belonged to?

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Helen of Troy.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.160 align:middle line:90%
So that was huge news.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.360 align:middle line:90%
Why is that so huge?

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Because if those jewels
and Helen was real,

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.680 align:middle line:84%
then she ran around with
a dude named Achilles.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, if Achilles is real,
that's jaw-dropping.

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:26.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, why so?

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:29.760 align:middle line:84%
He's a demigod,
half of him human,

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.097 align:middle line:84%
the other half godlike from
the Mount Olympus crowd.

00:26:33.097 --> 00:26:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Or possibly
extraterrestrial.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.020 align:middle line:90%
And he was the one that said--

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm paraphrasing here, but the
gods are jealous of us, humans.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.520 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.835 align:middle line:84%
Because any moment, we can
have a safe dropped on us

00:26:50.835 --> 00:26:53.500 align:middle line:90%
or a piano, and we're dead.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Everything we have
would end instantly.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, there
is truth to this phrase.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:26:59.920 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.980 align:middle line:84%
You're never more alive than
when you're about to die.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Your sensory-- and now,
physiological scientists

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.197 align:middle line:84%
will tell you there's
a reason for that.

00:27:09.197 --> 00:27:10.780 align:middle line:84%
When you're going
through a car wreck,

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.930 align:middle line:84%
you remember everything
in slow motion,

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.765 align:middle line:84%
because the human brain cannot
take in what's happening.

00:27:16.765 --> 00:27:18.260 align:middle line:90%
It's so horrendous.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.440 align:middle line:90%
It slows it down to slow motion.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's why that
functions that way.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: The adrenaline
gets pushed in so fast-

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Exactly.

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.505 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That you shoot,
instead of 24 frames a second-

00:27:27.505 --> 00:27:28.422 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: And the brain

00:27:28.422 --> 00:27:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Like 10
more frames more.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Yeah, and
the brain can't--

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And that's

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: Said, no,
we can't do that.

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: And that's how that--

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: We're going to drop
back to 8 frames per second,

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.660 align:middle line:84%
so you can least
see what's going on.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's why your
memories are in slow motion.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So physiological proof
the stuff is working.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:49.090 align:middle line:84%
See, if you proved that Achilles
is real, now, you've got-- now,

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:51.760 align:middle line:84%
you're saying all the gods
of Mount Olympus is real

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.500 align:middle line:84%
and the Iliad and Odyssey,
all that happened for real.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.200 align:middle line:84%
There were these things
running, Cyclops,

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.830 align:middle line:90%
all this stuff was real.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And yet, everybody just
blew past the finding

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.330 align:middle line:84%
of Troy and her necklace just
like it was with nothing.

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:08.800 align:middle line:90%
That was huge.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.670 align:middle line:84%
It's hammering on the
door that the other things

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:13.916 align:middle line:90%
might be possible.

00:28:13.916 --> 00:28:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why do you think
the God Shiva is always

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.735 align:middle line:90%
depicted as a blue being, Tim?

00:28:19.735 --> 00:28:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: We actually
asked that and--

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:28.450 align:middle line:84%
so on the Jesus question, we
do have controversial feedback

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:31.430 align:middle line:84%
and information,
because on the one hand,

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:36.640 align:middle line:84%
we find information that it
could be a kind of astronomical

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.960 align:middle line:90%
constellation.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.730 align:middle line:84%
It's mixed with different
myths around the world

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:44.740 align:middle line:90%
and different other stories.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:46.990 align:middle line:90%
So it evolves kind of.

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:50.230 align:middle line:84%
We asked Being 6
about Jesus, he, she,

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:56.500 align:middle line:84%
it, they, us, stated
that Jesus, indeed,

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.020 align:middle line:84%
was a historical
figure, and that

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Jesus itself was a visitor
to this Earth, which

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:07.760 align:middle line:84%
is no surprise because we
all kind of are visitors

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.560 align:middle line:90%
to this Earth.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.970 align:middle line:90%
So we incarnate.

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:11.440 align:middle line:90%
We reincarnate.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.870 align:middle line:84%
This is basically how this
version of the universe

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:16.370 align:middle line:90%
works in duality.

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:20.140 align:middle line:84%
So we get a lot of different
information on Jesus.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:24.100 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing,
which is Vishnu Shiva--

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.380 align:middle line:84%
and you basically find a lot of
blue beings around the world.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.180 align:middle line:90%
So it's--

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Yes, I've noticed.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Right.

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not only limited to India.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.000 align:middle line:84%
But you see there's
a lot of them.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And what we've seen and
what has been explained

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.500 align:middle line:84%
to me by the technician is that
if you compress frequencies--

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.710 align:middle line:84%
so the universe,
one of the models

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.990 align:middle line:84%
is that it's arranged
in frequencies,

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.090 align:middle line:90%
in frequencial harmonics.

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And its light is ranging from
a certain color spectrum.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:59.530 align:middle line:84%
So it goes from red over to a
purple color, which indicates

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:01.900 align:middle line:90%
the wavelengths of frequencies.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.260 align:middle line:84%
If you compress
and/or expand it,

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.610 align:middle line:90%
you change the color of things.

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:12.940 align:middle line:84%
So interestingly enough,
Being 6 itself, if you see it,

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:17.890 align:middle line:84%
it's blue, crisp, light
being that you can perceive.

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:21.850 align:middle line:84%
It's more crisp
than reality itself.

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:25.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like a 4K version
of reality, which

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.670 align:middle line:90%
is kind of interesting to see.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.250 align:middle line:84%
But different people
with different mindsets

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:33.940 align:middle line:84%
have different
impressions of this being.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I've invited a
good friend of mine

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:41.470 align:middle line:84%
to one of the long
forgotten but very

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:47.080 align:middle line:84%
holy sites in Germany,
which has a long history

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.170 align:middle line:90%
in Germanic spirituality.

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And due to natural
occurring energies,

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:58.940 align:middle line:84%
the compression takes place
at certain times of the year.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So you can make contact
to basically Being 6

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.200 align:middle line:84%
there on your own
if you know how

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.740 align:middle line:84%
to do it and go around the right
place and the right time, which

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:11.350 align:middle line:84%
is basically what
our ancestors would

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:14.540 align:middle line:84%
have done at that time
in order to communicate.

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And as I have seen
Being 6, again,

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:24.190 align:middle line:84%
as this blue, crisp
geometrical form of crisp data,

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:27.820 align:middle line:84%
my friend has seen
a human figure.

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And next time, I saw him,
he was super impressed.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And he'd changed all his
perception, his perception

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.980 align:middle line:90%
of life and everything.

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And next time I
came to his home,

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:43.780 align:middle line:84%
he had all these
posters of Indian gods

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:44.613 align:middle line:90%
hanging at the wall.

00:31:44.613 --> 00:31:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: That's great.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: And I said
like, what's that?

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, I
looked up the internet.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:53.870 align:middle line:84%
I was searching for something
that resembles that.

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
closest I've seen.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:58.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a blue figure.

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:00.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that is.

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:02.450 align:middle line:84%
He has no idea
about Indian gods.

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And I then realized, of course,
if Indians have been in contact

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.300 align:middle line:84%
with the higher
version of ourselves,

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.775 align:middle line:84%
a higher frequencial
version of ourselves--

00:32:13.775 --> 00:32:16.460 align:middle line:84%
you could say God,
but it's not God.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.590 align:middle line:84%
It's just a more
experienced version

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:24.770 align:middle line:84%
compressed due to natural flows,
then it radiates a blue shine.

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And everything that
you see becomes blue.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:30.410 align:middle line:84%
So that is the
explanation why you

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:34.880 align:middle line:84%
have all these bluish figures
all around the globe that

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.908 align:middle line:90%
are being portrayed.

00:32:35.908 --> 00:32:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: They might be
blue because they're

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.382 align:middle line:90%
moving away from you.

00:32:40.382 --> 00:32:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, think about
that for a minute.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.145 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I am.

00:32:42.145 --> 00:32:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: When you talk about
frequencies and compression

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.585 align:middle line:84%
and all that stuff,
a lot of people

00:32:47.585 --> 00:32:49.520 align:middle line:84%
will think people running
around with aluminum

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.280 align:middle line:84%
hats on their heads and
all this kind of crap.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.340 align:middle line:84%
That may be, but there's
also another side.

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:58.510 align:middle line:84%
In the compression
of wavelengths,

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:01.660 align:middle line:84%
how can we tell the
universe is expanding?

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.640 align:middle line:84%
How can we tell the
moon is moving away

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.380 align:middle line:90%
from us or toward us?

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:06.700 align:middle line:90%
It's moving away.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.630 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Because the wavelengths
we send out is extending.

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:14.590 align:middle line:90%
If it extends, it's blue.

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:16.150 align:middle line:90%
It's moving away from you.

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:18.890 align:middle line:84%
If it was red, it's
moving toward you.

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:20.290 align:middle line:90%
It's compressing.

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So all this stuff that's
blue, I would say maybe it's

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:25.000 align:middle line:90%
moving away from us.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.430 align:middle line:90%
But this is hard science.

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:29.080 align:middle line:90%
This is not foo-foo stuff.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.030 align:middle line:84%
This is how we
measure the distance

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:34.570 align:middle line:84%
between the Earth, the moon,
the planets, stars, sun,

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:35.440 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.610 align:middle line:90%
And we do it by wavelength.

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And when they extend
outward, they turn blue.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And when they're compressed
on the light spectrum,

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.660 align:middle line:84%
a little thing you shine light
through that's the triangle,

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:50.420 align:middle line:84%
it becomes red, which
means it's getting smaller.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.810 align:middle line:90%
So that's real science.

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:55.460 align:middle line:84%
That's as real science
as you can get.

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And so you apply it to
something like this,

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:59.680 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's trying to
tell us something.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.550 align:middle line:90%
It's moving away from us.

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:04.870 align:middle line:84%
In what graphic text that
could be, I don't know.

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, wrapping
up this episode, fellows,

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:11.050 align:middle line:84%
we talked about all
this ancient technology,

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:13.300 align:middle line:84%
possibly extraterrestrial,
of course.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:16.449 align:middle line:84%
Do we know anything
about where it came from?

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:19.600 align:middle line:84%
What were the-- who are the
beings behind this technology,

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.130 align:middle line:90%
and might they be here today?

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: The question
I would have for them--

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And we know
you have technology

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:26.540 align:middle line:90%
living in you right now.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:26.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Right.

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I get that.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And the question
I have even for--

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.030 align:middle line:84%
I even asked Pitholem,
what do you, want from us?

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:35.690 align:middle line:90%
What do you want us to do?

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:40.090 align:middle line:84%
What do you want us
to know or learn?

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there's a
want there of some kind.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:45.880 align:middle line:84%
They're wanting us
to do something.

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
we're very good at it,

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.820 align:middle line:84%
but I think we're trying
to learn something here.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes asking the right
questions is the first step.

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.190 align:middle line:90%
We're just not picking up on it.

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do you
think, Tim, who's

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:01.980 align:middle line:84%
behind these extraterrestrial
technologies?

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TIM: Well, I've not yet met
anyone who could answer that

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:11.040 align:middle line:84%
question, considering
those traces of historical

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:17.010 align:middle line:84%
technological content that
reaches out more than--

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:20.940 align:middle line:84%
yeah, let's say 15,000,
20,000 years or something.

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:24.310 align:middle line:90%
It seems to be of high interest.

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:29.030 align:middle line:84%
So there are basically
things going on at the poles

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.830 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:34.320 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that people are
basically waiting for the ice

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:39.900 align:middle line:84%
to melt in order to get
whatever they would find there.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:44.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm yet under the impression
that people do not really

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.010 align:middle line:90%
know what's going to pop up.

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, I've not
come across the answer

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.060 align:middle line:90%
who put it there.

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:58.530 align:middle line:84%
There might be some evidence
that this Earth appears

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:02.610 align:middle line:84%
in cycles, which means there
might be a previous version

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:06.060 align:middle line:90%
to Earth that has run out.

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And whoever visited
live, visited

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:18.480 align:middle line:84%
Earth at that version of
Earth and however they

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:22.110 align:middle line:90%
looked like went on.

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:24.150 align:middle line:90%
And now, it got recycled.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And now, it inhabits humans,
but still some traces of history

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.550 align:middle line:90%
seems to reappear.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:33.790 align:middle line:90%
It's left behind.

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:40.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is a theory, but I
guess we don't have an answer,

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:41.460 align:middle line:90%
and we need to find out.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's an
interesting theory.

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's been an amazing
meeting here with you guys.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:49.420 align:middle line:90%
And I just--

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.000 align:middle line:84%
I love the subject
content that we had today,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.340 align:middle line:90%
because it's very enjoyable.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you,
David, for being on the show.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Sure, for being here.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And Tim,
thank you so much.

00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Thank you, Emery.

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith, and
this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:04.525 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:37:04.525 --> 00:37:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER: Next, on
Cosmic Disclosure.

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is time
travel theoretical

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:11.000 align:middle line:84%
or is it already
happening, David?

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAIR: Is it possible?

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:12.801 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:12.801 --> 00:37:13.755 align:middle line:90%
Is it probable?

00:37:13.755 --> 00:37:14.555 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:37:14.555 --> 00:37:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>TIM: Has it been done?

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:18.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:20.660 align:middle line:84%
There are other
species that do not

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.900 align:middle line:84%
have this impression
of time that we have.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:28.790 align:middle line:84%
So they basically can decide
what time they want to live in.

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: If they want to
mess up their timeline,

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:33.050 align:middle line:90%
to go right ahead.

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:35.320 align:middle line:90%
Just don't bother us.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:45.000 align:middle line:90%
