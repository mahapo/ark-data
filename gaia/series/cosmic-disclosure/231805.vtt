>>SÉBASTIEN MARTIN:
What I believe

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.830 align:middle line:84%
is the Draco reptilian
race that's impacting

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.300 align:middle line:90%
humanity and world governments.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.320 align:middle line:84%
They want to potentially
control the world

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.200 align:middle line:84%
through their
manipulation, where

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.930 align:middle line:84%
they can portray
themselves as a God

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.575 align:middle line:84%
that humans can
relate to and worship.

00:00:26.575 --> 00:00:28.700 align:middle line:90%
[OTHERWORLDLY MUSIC]

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.430 align:middle line:84%
They believe that the Earth
was theirs to begin with.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH GOLEMBESKE: Oh, really?

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's why they believe
that this is their planet,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and they are tolerating us
based on the treaties in place

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.710 align:middle line:90%
with the Galactic Alliance.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So this is
an inflection point

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.933 align:middle line:84%
where they have to
jump in now if they

00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:90%
want to reach their agenda.

work for various governments

What if humanity's next
leap isn't about technology,

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.320 align:middle line:10%
but about breaking
free from control

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:10%
and raising consciousness?

Today, on Cosmic Disclosure,
we're joined by Sébastien Martin

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.790 align:middle line:10%
to explore the Draco,
the Pleiadians,

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.640 align:middle line:10%
and the coming
shift from 3D to 4D.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm Josh Golembeske, MUFON field
investigator and your guest host

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.900 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Sébastien, welcome
back to the show.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, thank you for
having me back again, Josh.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Of course.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited to continue
this conversation.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.550 align:middle line:84%
All right, so first question is,
what are the biggest challenges

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.210 align:middle line:84%
or problems that humanity will
face as we transition from 3D

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.055 align:middle line:90%
to 4D?

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: The biggest challenge
that we will be facing will be

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.190 align:middle line:84%
extracting ourselves from the
3D reality of monetary system,

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:84%
the technologies we use and take
for granted today and that we

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
embraced without questioning
what else could come next

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and what could be better
than what we have today.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.470 align:middle line:84%
So people are feeling
very comfortable

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.510 align:middle line:84%
with the idea of
using the existing

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.810 align:middle line:84%
technologies without
questioning, what's out there?

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Or what could be
potentially be used

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.560 align:middle line:90%
to help humanity in general?

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.890 align:middle line:84%
So I think that once we extract
ourselves from this mentality,

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.950 align:middle line:84%
we will be able to move further
in the evolutionary process

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.180 align:middle line:84%
because currently, what I
believe is the Draco reptilian

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.290 align:middle line:84%
race that's impacting humanity
and world governments,

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.590 align:middle line:90%
they have their own agenda.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.150 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine-- the way I
saw things is that the Draco

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.020 align:middle line:84%
race has a direct impact on,
I would say, secret societies

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:84%
mainly, where they can portray
themselves as a God of some sort

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.480 align:middle line:84%
that humans can
relate to and worship.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.930 align:middle line:90%
And this is to me very real.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And also, you can see that
through the various symbols

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.590 align:middle line:84%
that you can see
through the media.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Or even in pop culture,
you have all these symbols

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.170 align:middle line:90%
that keep popping up.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Like what specifically?

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Like, the
signs that they use.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.640 align:middle line:84%
They have various symbols
that they use on TV.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically to help
promote their secret society

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.080 align:middle line:90%
agenda.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's to do with embedding
our society with that 3D reality

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:90%
and without changing it.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's a way to keep us
under control so we don't evolve

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.590 align:middle line:90%
as quickly as we should be.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.320 align:middle line:84%
We have all the tools today
to emerge from 3D to 4D.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.280 align:middle line:84%
More and more people
are being aware of that,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:84%
but we are being
refrained from going there

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.500 align:middle line:90%
because of the current agendas.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And the worldwide
governments do not

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.840 align:middle line:90%
want humanity to evolve fast--

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:90%
or faster.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.800 align:middle line:90%
So everything is timely.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.260 align:middle line:84%
However, the Draco
reptilians are also

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.600 align:middle line:84%
doing that for their own purpose
without breaking the treaties

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:84%
in place with the
Galactic Alliance.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Yeah, I want
to know about that.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.230 align:middle line:84%
How are they able to do this
without breaking the protocols?

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.063 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, so
because they don't really

00:04:04.063 --> 00:04:08.160 align:middle line:84%
harm us in person-- of course,
they still do their own things

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle line:84%
behind closed doors the
same way as the Pleiadians

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:84%
would help the US
government, for example,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:90%
behind closed doors.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.420 align:middle line:84%
So humanity does not really
know what's going on,

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.810 align:middle line:90%
because it's not public.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.930 align:middle line:84%
As long as it's not
public, it's still

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.512 align:middle line:84%
within the realms of respecting
the treaties in place

00:04:25.512 --> 00:04:26.595 align:middle line:90%
for the Galactic Alliance.

00:04:26.595 --> 00:04:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So if the
Draco reptilians

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:84%
have their own agenda, and
they can use different means

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:84%
to achieve what they want
without disrupting the balance,

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.440 align:middle line:84%
then they can do
their own thing.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest with you,
I got involved with that

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.520 align:middle line:84%
personally when I got attacked
by a Draco reptilian twice.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And when I got
attacked, and when I got

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.837 align:middle line:84%
saved for my second attack
when I was in New York--

00:04:51.837 --> 00:04:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Wait, wait, so
what do you mean by attack?

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I was
attacked physically.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Like, basically, I
had a wound on my leg.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So when I was in New York, I
came back to my hotel bedroom.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And I had this massive
gash on my leg,

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.450 align:middle line:90%
and it came out of nowhere.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And so it was not deep
enough that it would bleed,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.410 align:middle line:84%
but it was red enough that
it could potentially bleed.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.610 align:middle line:90%
So it was that deep.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a
shower, came to bed.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to bed,
I could feel the attack.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.280 align:middle line:90%
And I had something in my body.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And I knew this was from the
Draco reptilians as well.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: OK.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.047 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So when
I close my eyes,

00:05:29.047 --> 00:05:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I could see that
floating, almost peel

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.520 align:middle line:84%
that looked like green
and white that was

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.835 align:middle line:90%
floating within my bloodstream.

00:05:37.835 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:84%
But I knew intuitively, right
away that it was directly

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.860 align:middle line:90%
connected to them.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And I also believe that this
weapon that was used against me

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.950 align:middle line:84%
was not from a Draco reptilian,
but from a human being that

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.305 align:middle line:90%
was working for the Dracos.

00:05:54.305 --> 00:05:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So they
are using people

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.600 align:middle line:84%
within even the US government
to achieve their own agenda.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.310 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that they
work for CIA or for the SSP

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.730 align:middle line:84%
or anything else, but they
have their own little secret

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:13.620 align:middle line:84%
societies and
organizations that allow

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.477 align:middle line:84%
those human beings to interact
with us, so through them.

00:06:16.477 --> 00:06:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Like they're
controlling them?

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.150 align:middle line:84%
They are-- they are controlling
them, of course, yes.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: OK.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They worship
them in the first place.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.810 align:middle line:84%
So of course, they have to
respect whatever they say.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.136 align:middle line:84%
But the Dracos themselves
won't do the work, right?

00:06:28.136 --> 00:06:28.948 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: OK.

00:06:28.948 --> 00:06:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So when I got
saved by my star family

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.660 align:middle line:84%
after I truly believe I died
that night, while in New York,

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.850 align:middle line:90%
I was in a real panic.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:84%
I thought that I could
not see my children again.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.970 align:middle line:90%
I had lots of regrets.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, man.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:45.687 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I felt that.

00:06:45.687 --> 00:06:46.840 align:middle line:90%
I felt it was very, very--

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.760 align:middle line:90%
I never felt that before.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And I
never felt it after.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:84%
But this was the only
time when I realized

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.560 align:middle line:90%
that I can't save myself.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.370 align:middle line:90%
I can't heal myself.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to die.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.370 align:middle line:90%
And I passed out.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And three hours
later, I woke up.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like
nothing happened.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
fresh as a daisy.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I could fly off the
curb of the streets.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And then the Draco reptilians
on the way back home said to me,

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.250 align:middle line:84%
now you can see what
we can do to you.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So leave us alone,
and we'll let you be.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.940 align:middle line:84%
When I interacted
with the Stargate,

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.480 align:middle line:84%
that's the time when I saw
that white Draco reptilian.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And so that same
Draco reptilian race

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.180 align:middle line:84%
was basically attacking
me because I was still

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.120 align:middle line:84%
trying to defend myself,
and I interacted with them.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.200 align:middle line:90%
And I thought I won.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.210 align:middle line:84%
I thought I did a
deal, great thing.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.530 align:middle line:84%
So the fact was the message that
I received was, leave us alone,

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.300 align:middle line:90%
and we let you be.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.000 align:middle line:84%
That led me to not do remote
viewing for three years.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, wow, OK.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: So I stopped--

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: That scared you
off for a little bit.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Completely,
yes, because I realized

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.870 align:middle line:90%
I had too much to lose.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I was being asked
to do more missions

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and to be involved,
and I turned them down.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'm sorry.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.630 align:middle line:90%
I can't help you.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And they were not happy with me,
because I was important to them.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I sat on the
back burner for years,

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:90%
and then I came back to it.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.550 align:middle line:84%
But for a long time, I
was really, really scared,

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.230 align:middle line:84%
not just for me, but
also for my family.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.313 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: I don't blame you.

00:08:17.313 --> 00:08:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: This time was
too real for me to ignore.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Yes.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:22.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: That sounds intense.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.450 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot to deal with.

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.298 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So we're
talking about the Draco,

00:08:26.298 --> 00:08:28.550 align:middle line:84%
and it seems like they
have an influence obviously

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.400 align:middle line:90%
over humanity.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.570 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
speculate about the Dracos

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:32.370 align:middle line:90%
and the influence.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.745 align:middle line:84%
Can you go deeper
on that for me?

00:08:33.745 --> 00:08:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes, sure.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.830 align:middle line:84%
So the Draco
reptilians, I believe

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.549 align:middle line:84%
it's been covered
by other people too.

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:42.650 align:middle line:84%
But the influence
on this planet is

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:84%
to further their agenda
to take over humanity.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.650 align:middle line:84%
They want to potentially
control the world

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.910 align:middle line:90%
through their manipulation.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.870 align:middle line:84%
They have different
ways to do it that way.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.280 align:middle line:84%
They have technologies, for
example, like using vaccines.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.080 align:middle line:90%
That's one of them.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And the reason why is
because the way they can connect

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:08.120 align:middle line:84%
to us easily would be through
telepathy, obviously, but also

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.630 align:middle line:90%
accessing our network.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And so if we have the same
components within ourselves,

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.090 align:middle line:84%
then it's way easier for them
to link us together and create

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.850 align:middle line:84%
a network, or let's
say a database, even

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.340 align:middle line:84%
like a virtual
database of humanity.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And how they can relate to
them and know where they are--

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:26.803 align:middle line:90%
it's almost like a tracker.

00:09:26.803 --> 00:09:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it that way.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So wait, are you
talking about a consciousness

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.740 align:middle line:90%
network they're tracking?

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.980 align:middle line:90%
What you mean by network?

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes, it is a
consciousness network for them.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.327 align:middle line:84%
So they can track us
down, and they can--

00:09:36.327 --> 00:09:37.285 align:middle line:90%
they know where we are.

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:38.535 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, I don't like that.

00:09:38.535 --> 00:09:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So you
can think about it

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.860 align:middle line:84%
the same way with the US
government tracking people

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.620 align:middle line:90%
and putting implants in them.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.620 align:middle line:84%
They are doing the same thing
to us so for a future agenda.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.057 align:middle line:84%
So like, this agenda for them
probably started in 2020.

00:09:53.057 --> 00:09:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: This is a recent agenda?

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: OK, people
talk about the Draco

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.500 align:middle line:84%
have been involved
with us for millennia.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Of course,
yes, and they have.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: But they've
changed their game.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They're
changing their way.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.020 align:middle line:84%
They're changing their way
of controlling humanity.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's also
because they also

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.090 align:middle line:84%
know that we are
evolving as a species.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:14.460 align:middle line:84%
They are as aware as us about
cosmic events that would happen.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:19.250 align:middle line:84%
They know that that could
reflect how it would impact

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:23.910 align:middle line:84%
their control over humanity
if we evolve from 3D to 4D.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.950 align:middle line:84%
As we become more powerful,
as humanity evolves

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.940 align:middle line:84%
to that level of consciousness,
then we become more of a threat

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.840 align:middle line:90%
or harder to control.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.310 align:middle line:84%
So they had to
change their game.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.360 align:middle line:84%
They had to adapt to the
evolutionary process of humanity

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.060 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't quite know
how the Pleiadians, while also

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.760 align:middle line:84%
helping the US government, are
going to be impacting humanity

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.960 align:middle line:90%
as a whole.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.400 align:middle line:90%
So everything is in motion.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Everything is moving.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.440 align:middle line:84%
They have so many moving
parts, and the Dracos

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.240 align:middle line:90%
are aware of that.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And so they're adapting
their role and their methods

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.985 align:middle line:84%
to achieve better
control over humanity.

00:11:00.985 --> 00:11:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So this is
an inflection point,

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.193 align:middle line:84%
where they have to
jump in now if they

00:11:04.193 --> 00:11:05.555 align:middle line:90%
want to reach their agenda.

00:11:05.555 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So this gets
into the whole thing

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.240 align:middle line:84%
you were talking about
earlier about protocols

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.243 align:middle line:90%
and galactic laws.

00:11:10.243 --> 00:11:12.160 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to start
breaking those laws.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.020 align:middle line:90%
And what's the consequence?

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.980 align:middle line:84%
If they break the laws, is
there a consequence for them?

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Or is this just like
an agreement they have?

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That is a
very good question.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the protocols
that we talked about

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.250 align:middle line:90%
will almost become irrelevant.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:84%
It's almost seems
like the treaty

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.530 align:middle line:84%
is in place, only
lasts for so long

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.300 align:middle line:90%
and under certain circumstances.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So when cosmic events occur,
it seems that those treaties

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.590 align:middle line:90%
no longer apply.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: OK, OK, so sorry,
not to cut you off,

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Sébastien but what do you
specifically mean by "cosmic

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:41.110 align:middle line:90%
events?"

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, well, we're
talking about asteroids

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.340 align:middle line:84%
that come in towards
Earth, and those asteroids

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:52.950 align:middle line:84%
could have a direct impact on
how we experience life on Earth.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:57.300 align:middle line:84%
We think of small asteroids
coming close to the Moon.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Or we can see that in the
sky, thinking, oh, that's

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:84%
just like a planetary asteroids
moving through our skies.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.170 align:middle line:84%
But literally, the
bigger asteroids

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.710 align:middle line:84%
that will come underneath the
satellite dishes or satellite

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.230 align:middle line:84%
communication
systems on Earth will

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:17.280 align:middle line:84%
have a direct impact on
the Earth frequencies

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.478 align:middle line:90%
and human frequencies.

00:12:18.478 --> 00:12:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Like, what do you mean?

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Not just the physical impact,
but the actual asteroid

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.770 align:middle line:84%
will change the
vibration of the Earth?

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's correct.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, interesting.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes, to the point that
it will change us completely as

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.260 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:90%
So we'll be adapting to that.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So those changes
in frequencies will

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.070 align:middle line:90%
allow us to evolve much faster.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Really?

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:38.795 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: How does that work?

00:12:38.795 --> 00:12:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Just the proximity
of these asteroids?

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Or is it like, the
fear of it makes us--

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.698 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I'll give
you an example.

00:12:43.698 --> 00:12:47.010 align:middle line:84%
So a few years ago, when
I had my experiences

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.980 align:middle line:84%
with the Pleiadians
and Zoar coming

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:84%
into my living room in 2012,
I went to a UFO conference.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And there was the team of
Dr. Leir present there,

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and they were doing
those tests on implants

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:03.610 align:middle line:90%
and all sorts of things.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was tested for an implant
in my knee and one in my neck,

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and the frequency of those
implants were 10 times

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:15.420 align:middle line:84%
higher than the Earth
frequency, 10 times higher.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.075 align:middle line:90%
And it was in my knee.

00:13:17.075 --> 00:13:17.950 align:middle line:90%
And you could see it.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.330 align:middle line:90%
You can see the machine.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.100 align:middle line:90%
And it was going up in numbers.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: What do you
mean by 10 times higher?

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.103 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:13:23.103 --> 00:13:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Planet Earth has--

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:25.780 align:middle line:90%
what's the--

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: The hertz.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: --frequency?

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.620 align:middle line:84%
In hertz, I think it's like--
is it 8 hertz or something?

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.090 align:middle line:90%
This one was going at 40 hertz.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So normally,
this is unnatural.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Yeah.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: The implants
respond to a certain frequency

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.870 align:middle line:84%
because they are
not human implants.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.040 align:middle line:90%
They are alien implants.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And so those frequencies
are generated

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.940 align:middle line:84%
so they can have a direct
contact with my star family,

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.700 align:middle line:84%
for example, or
even other races.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's say if the Grey aliens
decide to put an implant in me,

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.270 align:middle line:84%
then they will receive
the information.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: OK.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So the way we
respond to frequencies

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.330 align:middle line:84%
is very different
moving forward.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:09.100 align:middle line:84%
As the world
frequency will change,

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.370 align:middle line:84%
our bodies will react
to that as well.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.780 align:middle line:90%
In what shape or form?

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.710 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know yet,
but it will definitely

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:18.480 align:middle line:84%
change the way we see things
and we understand things.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: OK, so when these
asteroids or other cosmic events

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:23.010 align:middle line:84%
happen and it changes
our frequency,

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:27.440 align:middle line:84%
is that change related
to going from 3D to 4D?

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: And 5D.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: And 5D.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So today, we know that some
people are more subjected

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and so sensitive
to 4D realities.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Talking about remote
viewers, psychics,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:43.130 align:middle line:84%
some people who basically have
a direct connection to source

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:46.620 align:middle line:84%
channelers, all of these
people are in 3D realms.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.785 align:middle line:84%
But they are transitioning to 4D
much faster than regular people.

00:14:50.785 --> 00:14:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to realize
that those people will also

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.430 align:middle line:84%
be subjected to the same
frequencies and energies.

00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And based on their
level of current state,

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.850 align:middle line:84%
it will change their
frequency level as well,

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.215 align:middle line:84%
much greater than
regular people,

00:15:05.215 --> 00:15:08.070 align:middle line:84%
based on already their
evolutionary process.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:14.030 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe that some people
will have a much deeper impact

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:17.740 align:middle line:84%
or deeper understanding of
higher frequencies than just

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:18.540 align:middle line:90%
the 4D.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I think 5D and
6Ds will probably come into play

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.100 align:middle line:90%
as well--

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: 6D?

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:24.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: --as early as 2029.

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Oh, we're right in
the middle of a transition

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.190 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:30.650 align:middle line:84%
So the next couple of
years are going to be--

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's going to be
pretty challenging, yes.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.295 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Challenging,
exciting, rocky--

00:15:34.295 --> 00:15:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Exactly, yes.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: A lot.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:35.750 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:36.060 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I think it's very
exciting at the same time.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:38.807 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Yeah, I know--

00:15:38.807 --> 00:15:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --because
I think it's time.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.100 align:middle line:84%
I just wish that we had
more time to prepare.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.960 align:middle line:90%
I think that if we--

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:84%
let's assume that we
embraced the technologies

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.850 align:middle line:84%
that the Dracos have
been suppressing

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.950 align:middle line:90%
for the last decades.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the oil and
gas industry, for example.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.900 align:middle line:84%
We rely heavily on those today,
and coal and all the minerals

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.220 align:middle line:84%
that we have or
depleting the Earth from.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:08.120 align:middle line:84%
However, if we used other types
of energies, like free energies,

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.320 align:middle line:84%
for example, which, again, have
been suppressed by our world

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:15.410 align:middle line:84%
governments to promote
the Draco agenda,

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.660 align:middle line:84%
that's the biggest
challenge that we face.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So the suppression
of free energy is--

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.127 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people talk about how
it's related to just money,

00:16:22.127 --> 00:16:22.255 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:22.255 --> 00:16:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: They want
to keep free energy.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: But that, the
deeper thing going on

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.112 align:middle line:84%
is it's a Draco
influence over us.

00:16:28.112 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:84%
They're holding that back
because free energy--

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.530 align:middle line:84%
if I'm getting this
right-- is really important

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.702 align:middle line:84%
for the transition
from 3D to 4D to 5D.

00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That's correct
because the old technologies

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.180 align:middle line:90%
will no longer matter.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.900 align:middle line:84%
You have to realize that the
oil industry, the gas industry,

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.730 align:middle line:84%
the monetary system as we
know it will no longer matter,

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.710 align:middle line:84%
because it will become
irrelevant to the next level

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:53.870 align:middle line:84%
of energies that we'll be facing
and because our understanding

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:57.450 align:middle line:84%
of this planet will be very
different, and the cosmos.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.220 align:middle line:84%
So we will have to move
forward with different types

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.220 align:middle line:90%
of energies.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, the
Dracos know this, too.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.869 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why they
are implementing slowly

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:11.849 align:middle line:84%
some energies that
are sort of green

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:14.680 align:middle line:84%
but still relying
on old resources.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Yeah, yeah.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.839 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: So it's a bait.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Like, they're baiting us into
still remaining into the 3D

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.944 align:middle line:84%
reality, even for
the new-age people.

00:17:22.944 --> 00:17:24.319 align:middle line:84%
They will say,
oh, we are looking

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:28.730 align:middle line:84%
at Tesla cars and all of these
electric cars and all that.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a fallacy to
believe that this

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.260 align:middle line:84%
would be at the end of
pollution and everything

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:84%
else because even the
batteries themselves

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.220 align:middle line:90%
will have to be replaced.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And that costs a lot of money,
and it's very polluting, too.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.780 align:middle line:84%
So there is no real
solutions in that.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.640 align:middle line:90%
This is not the actual solution.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.020 align:middle line:84%
The free energies that-- the 0
point energy are the solutions.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.280 align:middle line:90%
But that doesn't make money.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.178 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason
why it has to be--

00:17:53.178 --> 00:17:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Right, of course.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.595 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It has
to be different.

00:17:55.595 --> 00:17:57.673 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So the Draco are
obviously influencing us

00:17:57.673 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle line:84%
in this negative way,
and the Pleiadians

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.310 align:middle line:90%
are trying to help us.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.820 align:middle line:84%
How do those
competing agendas, I

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.300 align:middle line:84%
guess, compete
against each other?

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.920 align:middle line:84%
How do the competing agendas
compete against each other?

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That's exactly
what you're saying.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.960 align:middle line:84%
They are competing, and they
are competing with an agenda

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.500 align:middle line:90%
and a time frame in place.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:15.220 align:middle line:84%
So the Pleiadians are working
with the US governments as well.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.590 align:middle line:84%
So they're helping with
reverse engineering.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.770 align:middle line:84%
They are helping
with technologies

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:24.540 align:middle line:84%
that would help our governments
to fight against other races

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.350 align:middle line:90%
and for the cosmos.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So they are basically
doing it to save humanity

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.980 align:middle line:90%
against potential threats.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.470 align:middle line:84%
They're not doing it to help
free energy, for example,

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:37.510 align:middle line:84%
because they know
that's coming anyway.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: OK.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They already
know our future.

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.800 align:middle line:84%
What they're not seeing
is the potential change

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.030 align:middle line:90%
in the timeline.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:84%
With a slight change, you
could have a massive impact

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.180 align:middle line:90%
on their future.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.580 align:middle line:84%
So they are keeping a very close
watch on what's happening today.

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:53.813 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: OK, and--

00:18:53.813 --> 00:18:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: The Dracos
are doing the same.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:00.030 align:middle line:84%
The Draco reptilians were also
part of the Galactic Alliance

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.130 align:middle line:90%
at one point.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, really?

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:02.862 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:19:02.862 --> 00:19:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Then they got kicked
out because of their behavior.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's right.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:06.155 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: OK.

00:19:06.155 --> 00:19:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And right now, the Pleiadians--
so if I get this straight,

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.670 align:middle line:84%
parts of the US government and
these transnational corporations

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:15.220 align:middle line:84%
are being influenced at the same
time by two competing agendas.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: More than just two.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.530 align:middle line:90%
There are more agendas.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:20.440 align:middle line:84%
We are just talking about
Pleiadians and Dracos here,

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.350 align:middle line:84%
but there are other
races at play.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:25.810 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many races as
part of the Galactic Alliance.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:29.096 align:middle line:84%
So to me, this is just
one of the agendas.

00:19:29.096 --> 00:19:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Humanity is very important to
both Pleiadians and Andromedans

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.630 align:middle line:84%
and whatever races are
out there, even the Greys.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:42.300 align:middle line:84%
But the Dracos are
the only species

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:46.000 align:middle line:90%
that have no link to humanity.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.900 align:middle line:84%
They were here before us, and
they have nothing to do with us.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.470 align:middle line:84%
They believe that the Earth
was theirs to begin with.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, really?

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.520 align:middle line:84%
That's why they believe
that this is their planet,

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and they are tolerating us
based on the treaties in place

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:04.430 align:middle line:84%
with the Galactic Alliance
because they were part of it,

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:05.230 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And they allowed the
Pleiadians to have

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.240 align:middle line:90%
those experiences on Earth.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:14.350 align:middle line:84%
So all of this is very complex
because it involves many races.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:17.410 align:middle line:84%
It involves many
historical events.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And now we're all competing
for space on planet Earth

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.530 align:middle line:84%
while evolving humanity and
going up to the next level.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.840 align:middle line:90%
So it's all very interesting.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:29.927 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: It's complicated.

00:20:29.927 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:90%
But of course it is.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.560 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.992 align:middle line:84%
But why did the Draco
think this is their planet?

00:20:33.992 --> 00:20:35.825 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Because they
were there before us.

00:20:35.825 --> 00:20:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: They were?

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:36.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Maybe they
have a claim to it.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So imagine the
dinosaurs, let's say.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And they evolved from
dinosaurs, and they

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:50.700 align:middle line:90%
retained that reptilian look.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.800 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, they evolved.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And over time, there were
many, many cataclysms that

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.380 align:middle line:90%
happened on planet Earth for--

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.440 align:middle line:90%
with real events.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And so they had
to go underground.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They had
to live underground

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:03.175 align:middle line:90%
to protect themselves.

00:21:03.175 --> 00:21:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: OK.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They could no
longer live on the surface.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And then they stayed on the
ground for all this time.

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So same as Pleiadians,
so for us, humanity,

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.620 align:middle line:90%
we evolved to be them.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And we go from being on Earth
to other planetary systems,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.040 align:middle line:84%
to have spaceships,
to have everything.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.925 align:middle line:84%
The Dracos did exactly
the same thing.

00:21:21.925 --> 00:21:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: They
started from here.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: They
originated from Earth?

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Not from
some distant planet,

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.710 align:middle line:84%
and this was like a
secondary place they evolved.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's correct.

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: This was their home.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's correct.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: That does make
it really confusing.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:31.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I know.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.798 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: I'm not on
team Draco here,

00:21:32.798 --> 00:21:34.255 align:middle line:90%
but I get why they're angry.

00:21:34.255 --> 00:21:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Wow!

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: All right.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So all right, this
is getting-- this

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:37.590 align:middle line:90%
is getting really interesting.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.560 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, a lot of
people talk about how

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:84%
we have parts of us that are
reptilian, like the reptilian

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:43.280 align:middle line:90%
brain.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, are we also--

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.707 align:middle line:84%
like, are we part reptilian, I
guess, what I'm getting at here?

00:21:47.707 --> 00:21:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Of course.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, obviously we have--

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:54.770 align:middle line:84%
part of our DNA, we used to
have a tail, like the tail bone.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: All right, yeah.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So we used
to have longer tails

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:01.980 align:middle line:84%
before because we are part of
multiple species on the planet.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So as we evolved from, like I
said, chimpanzees to humankind,

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.490 align:middle line:84%
there was a missing
link in between.

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:14.820 align:middle line:84%
There's only 4% change in
human DNA from a chimpanzee,

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.670 align:middle line:90%
so it's very small.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.090 align:middle line:84%
But they are this
missing link as to what

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.560 align:middle line:90%
makes that connection.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:26.670 align:middle line:84%
So as to get up to the chimp
area or evolutionary process,

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:28.620 align:middle line:90%
what brought us to that?

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.600 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, the evolution itself.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.770 align:middle line:84%
We were part dinosaurs and
fish and everything else,

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and we evolved to be
chimpanzees and then humankind.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:41.210 align:middle line:84%
The humanity has
evolved differently.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Chimpanzees today
are not humans,

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.375 align:middle line:84%
but they are also evolving
at their own pace.

00:22:46.375 --> 00:22:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Right.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: The Draco
reptilians to me

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.990 align:middle line:90%
were exactly at the same rate.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:53.710 align:middle line:84%
So they evolved, and they
branched out at a certain point

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.973 align:middle line:84%
to go from dinosaurs
to reptilians.

00:22:56.973 --> 00:22:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: So wait, wait.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:00.490 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that the
missing link is DNA,

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:01.775 align:middle line:90%
is DNA manipulation?

00:23:01.775 --> 00:23:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes, even for
the Draco reptilians.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.030 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that there were
some manipulations happening

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:06.830 align:middle line:90%
for them as well.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:07.495 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Like another race--

00:23:07.495 --> 00:23:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: --another ET race--

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's correct.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: --manipulated--

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's correct.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Do you know who?

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I have my doubts.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:12.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't know for sure.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest with
you, I haven't really

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:15.410 align:middle line:90%
looked into it deeply.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.380 align:middle line:84%
But I certainly believe that
the Anunnaki were part of it.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:21.680 align:middle line:84%
It seems like they were
a part of us and them.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's right.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were doing a
lot of genetic mutations

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:26.000 align:middle line:90%
and manipulations over time.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Yeah.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Humanity
is just one of them.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:31.330 align:middle line:84%
You have to realize that
their agenda was also

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.450 align:middle line:84%
to learn and try to use
whatever species they could

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:38.980 align:middle line:84%
to have basically their gold
and trying to mine planet

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.550 align:middle line:90%
Earth at the time.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:45.130 align:middle line:84%
So through time, over time, they
manipulated different species

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:46.870 align:middle line:84%
to see how they
could do with it.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And the Draco to me
is a result of that.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And so they evolved to
be what they are today,

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.025 align:middle line:84%
and now they obviously have
their own systems in place.

00:23:57.025 --> 00:23:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: They're out there in the
universe, in their own planets

00:23:59.650 --> 00:23:59.900 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.300 align:middle line:84%
But are they still underground
here, living as a society?

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes, yes.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:05.760 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Dracos have their
own spaceships and everything

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.560 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:12.010 align:middle line:84%
They created havoc in
the universe and not just

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:12.890 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
the future, too.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, we are talking
about the Pleiadians.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.700 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians had wars
with the Draco reptilians

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.350 align:middle line:90%
on their own home planet.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:22.693 align:middle line:90%
Their home planet got exploded.

00:24:22.693 --> 00:24:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why most
of the Pleiadians today

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:28.450 align:middle line:84%
live on-- today-- in the
future live on spaceships,

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:31.430 align:middle line:84%
because they have
massive fleets.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And they colonized
other worlds as well.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:38.230 align:middle line:84%
But they mostly live in
space and wandering around

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:39.680 align:middle line:90%
and traveling around, basically.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Well, this brings
up the question of, how are

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:45.090 align:middle line:84%
their competing agendas, the
Pleiadians and the Draco--

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:47.990 align:middle line:84%
like, how does that play
out on Earth, and especially

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:49.957 align:middle line:84%
in conjunction with
us, with humanity?

00:24:49.957 --> 00:24:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: The Draco reptilian
is like-- we already

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:52.840 align:middle line:90%
talked about this.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.750 align:middle line:90%
The agenda is very simple.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:56.670 align:middle line:84%
They want to take
over the planet Earth.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:01.100 align:middle line:84%
They want to basically convince
the worldwide governments

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.020 align:middle line:90%
that this is the only way out.

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.830 align:middle line:84%
This is your way of
evolving to a dominant race.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.960 align:middle line:84%
So you have to think
about one thing--

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.190 align:middle line:84%
why humans who work
for various governments

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:16.500 align:middle line:84%
agree to help the Draco
reptilians' agenda.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.310 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Why?

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Because they've
been given powers.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.420 align:middle line:84%
They've been given
safety for the future.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Many secret societies,
for example, learn.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And I know that from
facts, that some of them

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:31.620 align:middle line:84%
are also given the
powers of immortality.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Really?

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So there's
people alive today who--

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: --are
considered immortal?

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Wow!

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And those people are full-blown
secret society members,

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and they are completely
part of this agenda.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.030 align:middle line:90%
And they support it.

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So they are in a very different
mindset than most people

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:54.085 align:middle line:84%
because they think
about themselves.

00:25:54.085 --> 00:25:55.210 align:middle line:90%
They think of their family.

00:25:55.210 --> 00:26:00.930 align:middle line:84%
They think of how they
can gain power over time

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.728 align:middle line:84%
with the Dracos
allowing them to be.

00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:05.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how that would
be respected down the line.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:05.300 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And the thing is,
the Draco reptilians still

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:14.170 align:middle line:84%
need humans as well on Earth
because we can still help them.

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.330 align:middle line:90%
We can still do chores.

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:17.380 align:middle line:90%
We can still build.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.410 align:middle line:84%
We are very useful
at the same way

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.510 align:middle line:84%
as we're very useful
to the Anunnaki.

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.770 align:middle line:90%
So it changes nothing to them.

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:27.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's part of the same
evolutionary process for them,

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:30.180 align:middle line:84%
because as a superior race,
they believe that they

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:90%
have the right over humanity.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So you're saying there's
people on this planet alive

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.280 align:middle line:84%
right now who are probably been
alive for hundreds of years

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.580 align:middle line:90%
because they've been--

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.175 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: No, I don't think so.

00:26:41.175 --> 00:26:44.930 align:middle line:84%
I think it started
a few decades ago.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:46.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not that old.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: OK.

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That process of
aging and becoming immortal

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.590 align:middle line:84%
has been a fairly
recent development.

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:58.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that those
tools or those perks

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:01.092 align:middle line:84%
have been provided to those
people until recent times.

00:27:01.092 --> 00:27:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Maybe because there's
an inflection point going on,

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and they're trying to motivate
people more to join their side.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Exactly.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Ah, yeah,
that makes sense.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I guess what I'm getting
at here is like--

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.370 align:middle line:84%
I hate saying it this way,
but who's going to win,

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:14.840 align:middle line:84%
the Draco agenda or
the Pleiadian agenda?

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.410 align:middle line:84%
How do you see that playing
out with humanity in our own

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:19.140 align:middle line:84%
frequency as we
transition to 4D?

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yes, I
certainly believe--

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and again, to me,
it's common sense

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:28.540 align:middle line:84%
because the Pleiadians
will win simply

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.540 align:middle line:84%
because they do exist
because we still survive.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:32.610 align:middle line:90%
And we still evolve.

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So if they
do exist in the future,

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:40.140 align:middle line:84%
and we are the ancestors, it
is clear to me that, of course,

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.780 align:middle line:90%
humanity will survive.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.413 align:middle line:84%
And the Dracos must
still do their own thing.

00:27:44.413 --> 00:27:45.830 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
mean that they will

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.820 align:middle line:90%
win whatever they decide to do.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So I don't believe that planet
Earth will become theirs.

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that
they will win over that.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:59.430 align:middle line:84%
I think that as the
evolutionary process happens,

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.040 align:middle line:84%
it will also shift
their own frequency.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.670 align:middle line:84%
They're not aware of
that, but the frequency

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.270 align:middle line:84%
of the planet Earth will
also modify their own.

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:08.070 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: The Dracos?

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes, of course.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.060 align:middle line:84%
It will change
everybody's frequency.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.683 align:middle line:84%
This is part of who the
Pleiadians are today as well.

00:28:13.683 --> 00:28:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So they're
trying to almost help

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.290 align:middle line:90%
the Draco in some sense.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:17.095 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It will
help everybody--

00:28:17.095 --> 00:28:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, that's--

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: --not just us.

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.230 align:middle line:84%
So everybody will
benefit from it

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:24.220 align:middle line:84%
because it will have a much
different understanding of who

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.020 align:middle line:90%
they are.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And why do you think that
in the future, for example--

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:90%
we talked about this--

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:33.325 align:middle line:84%
that the Galactic Alliance
had the Draco on board?

00:28:33.325 --> 00:28:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: That's right.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.010 align:middle line:90%
And they broke away.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:36.005 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Exactly, right?

00:28:36.005 --> 00:28:36.805 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Yeah.

00:28:36.805 --> 00:28:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So at
some point in time,

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.850 align:middle line:90%
they had this frequency check.

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And they got these downloads,
and they became more superior,

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.390 align:middle line:90%
but also more ethical.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Sure.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So they became
part of the Galactic Alliance

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.130 align:middle line:90%
through that process.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: What, they de-evolved?

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Or they just-- their
frequency changed?

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: No, what happened
was they became more greedy.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.073 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, something
happened down the line--

00:29:05.073 --> 00:29:06.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
the future here.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Yeah.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: When they separated
from the Galactic Alliance,

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:16.060 align:middle line:84%
it's because they decided to
change this timeline on Earth.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.177 align:middle line:84%
without telling the
Galactic Alliance.

00:29:18.177 --> 00:29:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, they broke protocol.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's right.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Yeah.

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, and that's
when it first started.

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.473 align:middle line:84%
And so they decided to
change their own DNA

00:29:25.473 --> 00:29:27.390 align:middle line:84%
and come back to Earth
as well, because that's

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:28.070 align:middle line:90%
where they came from.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Wow!

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:29.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:30.135 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:29:30.135 --> 00:29:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: This is a very deep
conversation here because--

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Yeah, I love it.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: --it's very complex.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And it branches out to so
many other races and agendas

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:42.120 align:middle line:90%
that nobody even thought about.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Well, our audience
is ready for this.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.180 align:middle line:90%
They can take it.

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:45.625 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: OK.

00:29:45.625 --> 00:29:46.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:47.278 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: This is mind blowing.

00:29:47.278 --> 00:29:48.750 align:middle line:90%
We have the Draco agenda.

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:51.590 align:middle line:90%
We have the Pleiadian agenda.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:52.390 align:middle line:90%
What's next?

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.932 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen next with
these two competing agendas?

00:29:54.932 --> 00:29:56.100 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to see?

00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, in my eyes,
it's leading to the same outcome

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.880 align:middle line:84%
because, like we talked
about, if the Pleiadians have

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.210 align:middle line:84%
their own agenda, trying to
raise humanity's consciousness

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:11.780 align:middle line:84%
to the next level, the
Dracos don't so much

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.220 align:middle line:90%
care about that today.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:17.120 align:middle line:84%
But with cosmic events, they
will be directly impacted

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.060 align:middle line:90%
by that, too.

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:21.170 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, their own
consciousness will also change

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.310 align:middle line:84%
and be modified, too,
in a positive way,

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and then none of the agendas
will no longer matter once we go

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:31.610 align:middle line:84%
to the next level and
go into the 4D and 5D.

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So they somehow
believe that today,

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:38.750 align:middle line:84%
they have to take over
humanity, for example,

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and take over planet
Earth because they

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.720 align:middle line:90%
believe it's theirs.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.520 align:middle line:84%
But none of this will matter
after the cosmic events

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.520 align:middle line:84%
because they will simply
just embrace whatever comes.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.885 align:middle line:84%
And it will become like a shift
in their own consciousness,

00:30:51.885 --> 00:30:54.470 align:middle line:84%
same as the Pleiadians are
working towards that today.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And they feel that
it's not conflicting.

00:30:57.110 --> 00:31:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they are not
alarmed by what's going on.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: But besides
the cosmic events

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.630 align:middle line:84%
that can shift our frequency,
what can people do today?

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:07.430 align:middle line:84%
What practices or
their own protocols

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:09.680 align:middle line:84%
can they initiate to
help the transition?

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.270 align:middle line:84%
I think most people already
do meditations and these sorts

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:15.940 align:middle line:90%
of things, which is standard.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:21.550 align:middle line:84%
But what is very important
is to accept timelines,

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:23.900 align:middle line:84%
like the right
timeline for yourself,

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.680 align:middle line:84%
because if you believe
that in positivity,

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.770 align:middle line:84%
and you stay in that
mindset of being positive,

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:32.710 align:middle line:84%
regardless of what I'm
talking about today

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:35.750 align:middle line:84%
and about the agendas
and these other things,

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:41.000 align:middle line:84%
if people believe that they can
prevent or stop a potential war,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.910 align:middle line:84%
for example, then those
events will occur.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.760 align:middle line:84%
But you truly have to
believe that this is reality,

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:47.960 align:middle line:90%
that this is it.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:51.770 align:middle line:84%
You can't stay away
from having doubts.

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:55.315 align:middle line:84%
If you have doubts, whatever
meditations, protocols you have

00:31:55.315 --> 00:31:56.450 align:middle line:90%
don't work.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:58.510 align:middle line:90%
You need to be certain.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:00.670 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
way moving forward,

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:03.550 align:middle line:84%
is to be certain of
whatever you know,

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:07.720 align:middle line:84%
whatever you believe in is
there, and regardless of what

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.200 align:middle line:90%
other people talk about.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.725 align:middle line:84%
So this requires a
shift in consciousness.

00:32:11.725 --> 00:32:12.525 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Wow!

00:32:12.525 --> 00:32:13.360 align:middle line:90%
OK, yeah.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That's
the only one way.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:15.577 align:middle line:90%
There is no other way.

00:32:15.577 --> 00:32:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: OK, this has
been a theme in Cosmic

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.360 align:middle line:84%
lately about belief,
and your own belief will

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.605 align:middle line:90%
lead to positive adjustments.

00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Now, there's
this old adage about,

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:24.205 align:middle line:90%
you don't fight the old.

00:32:24.205 --> 00:32:26.330 align:middle line:84%
If there's something
terrible-- you don't fight it.

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:28.650 align:middle line:84%
You just concentrate
on building the new.

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yes.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: I say that because
how we go forward--

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:33.920 align:middle line:84%
should we be fighting against
these reptilian agendas?

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Or should we be more focused
on our own personal development

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:38.533 align:middle line:84%
and moving forward at
a higher vibration?

00:32:38.533 --> 00:32:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, I
think it's both.

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, OK.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: There's a
survival trigger there.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.790 align:middle line:84%
The humanity--
let's say, if they

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:53.010 align:middle line:84%
are faced with an agenda that is
negative or seems negative to us

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:54.783 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning,
we will obviously

00:32:54.783 --> 00:32:56.075 align:middle line:90%
automatically defend ourselves.

00:32:56.075 --> 00:32:56.875 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Yeah.

00:32:56.875 --> 00:32:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That's what we
do because we don't really

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.430 align:middle line:90%
think of anything else.

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:04.050 align:middle line:84%
That's the only survival
instinct that we have.

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:08.790 align:middle line:84%
However, if we truly believe
that this reality doesn't

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:12.190 align:middle line:84%
have to happen, then we could
modify it before it happens.

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And starting today, we
could do that today--

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Today.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.415 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --changing
the timeline

00:33:16.415 --> 00:33:18.330 align:middle line:84%
so those events
will never happen.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So there will be a
shift in the timeline

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:22.300 align:middle line:90%
that things could get delayed.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about earthquakes.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Anything that could
potentially happen,

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.555 align:middle line:84%
we could delay things
simply by thinking it.

00:33:28.555 --> 00:33:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Even
hardcore, physical--

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Even
hardcore, physical--

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: --events?

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:32.735 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Everything.

00:33:32.735 --> 00:33:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the
universe can be impacted

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.743 align:middle line:90%
through the thoughts, process.

00:33:36.743 --> 00:33:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Consciousness.

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Consciousness.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Wow!

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:39.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:40.480 align:middle line:90%
Wow, Sébastien, that's really--

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It's quite powerful.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.542 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: That's wonderful.

00:33:42.542 --> 00:33:45.570 align:middle line:84%
What do you think the most
important thing people should

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:48.030 align:middle line:84%
understand about, I
guess, taking back

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.340 align:middle line:84%
their own sovereignty
during this shift?

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: One, connecting to
your star family or even source.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:58.620 align:middle line:84%
If you believe that you are
directly coming from the source

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and incarnating
into a human being,

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.260 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to recall and
remember where you come from.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.159 align:middle line:90%
That's part of the whole.

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:10.690 align:middle line:84%
As a human being, we
are not just humans.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:15.270 align:middle line:84%
We are a complex entity
that has connections

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:18.210 align:middle line:90%
to other races and not just one.

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:20.699 align:middle line:90%
We are a patchwork of races.

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:22.239 align:middle line:90%
Like, you talk about reptilians.

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:24.040 align:middle line:90%
We talked about Pleiadians.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.440 align:middle line:90%
We talked about the Greys.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that we
have been manipulated.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:33.429 align:middle line:84%
And if we embrace those
changes or those manipulations,

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:35.400 align:middle line:90%
this is who we are today.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.659 align:middle line:90%
We can't just negate it.

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:38.364 align:middle line:90%
We can't just push it away.

00:34:38.364 --> 00:34:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you can
embrace your star family

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:45.719 align:middle line:84%
as the majority component
in your DNA, for example.

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:50.270 align:middle line:84%
But your DNA is not 100%
Pleiadian, for example.

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:54.630 align:middle line:84%
It has other components in it
that reflects the other races.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:55.860 align:middle line:90%
And we're all one.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.950 align:middle line:84%
So if we are all
one, then we have

00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:59.490 align:middle line:90%
to embrace the Draco reptilians.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:01.080 align:middle line:84%
We have to embrace
the Pleiadians.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.080 align:middle line:84%
We have to embrace
the Anunnaki, and we

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:07.550 align:middle line:84%
have to be at peace with it
because this is who we are.

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: I love that.

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:10.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are
such turbulent times,

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and you're offering such a
beautiful, positive, hopeful,

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.140 align:middle line:90%
transformative message.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for being
here today, Sébastien.

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:18.360 align:middle line:84%

you for having me.
