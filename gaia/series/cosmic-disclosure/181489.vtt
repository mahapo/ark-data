00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.220 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: We've heard
of ET civilizations living

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.990 align:middle line:10%
on Earth in our ancient past.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.740 align:middle line:84%
But is it possible there
are ET civilizations living

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.310 align:middle line:84%
underground or some hidden
areas on Earth this very moment?

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Cosmic Disclosure."

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.180 align:middle line:90%
Emery Smith.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.495 align:middle line:90%
Emery, this is exciting.

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY SMITH: It is.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.980 align:middle line:10%
And it's something that needs
to be brought to the world's

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.640 align:middle line:10%
attention, because we
have amongst us ETs

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.850 align:middle line:10%
living not only on terrestrial
land but underneath the Earth.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.790 align:middle line:84%
There are civilizations
that have been here

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:84%
for a very long time that
have thrived and still

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:84%
stay here, and
work in conjunction

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:84%
with some human people
and sometimes not.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.040 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the
different civilization

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.804 align:middle line:90%
that you're referring to.

00:01:02.804 --> 00:01:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
they doing here?

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.327 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they've
been here for a long time.

00:01:06.327 --> 00:01:07.910 align:middle line:84%
They've been here
before we were here,

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.690 align:middle line:84%
before we actually started up
and started building buildings

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.600 align:middle line:90%
and populating the Earth.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And they have their own--
it's like their own home,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.160 align:middle line:84%
just like what
are we doing here?

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.310 align:middle line:90%
It's our home.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.670 align:middle line:84%
We consider planet
Earth our home,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.472 align:middle line:84%
and they have their
own home, too.

00:01:24.472 --> 00:01:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's different
types of biospheres

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.040 align:middle line:84%
that are located all
around the planet

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.260 align:middle line:84%
inside deep within
the Earth that

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:84%
have their own atmospheres, and
have their own bioluminescent

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.822 align:middle line:84%
technologies, and can
grow their own food.

00:01:35.822 --> 00:01:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And also, you have to
understand they're a little bit

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:90%
more higher tech than we are.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So they have their own
portal travel system

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.870 align:middle line:84%
where they can go amongst
the stars and other planets

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.130 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.560 align:middle line:84%
They're not driving around
in cars, that's for sure.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These ET civilizations,
how many are there down under?

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I'm only aware of about
four of these ET civilizations

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.450 align:middle line:84%
that I have been
exposed to, I'll say,

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.490 align:middle line:84%
that are living amongst us
in underground facilities

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.580 align:middle line:84%
that they have created that
are not our facilities.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And some of these are craft
that have been teletransported

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.650 align:middle line:84%
into different
parts of the Earth,

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.690 align:middle line:84%
and different parts of
the mountain ranges,

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.110 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And of course, a lot of these
are located on national parks

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and things like this and
in very desolate areas

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.400 align:middle line:84%
like the bottom of the
oceans, and Antarctica,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.330 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.420 align:middle line:84%
How many are we talking about
in terms of the entities?

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.220 align:middle line:90%
Thousands?

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.780 align:middle line:90%
Millions?

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.960 align:middle line:90%
How any--

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.670 align:middle line:84%
There's over probably
a few million

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.730 align:middle line:84%
that I'm aware of that are
constantly coming and going

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.530 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.530 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
these extraterrestrials that

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.020 align:middle line:84%
have been here for a
very, very long time are

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.890 align:middle line:84%
going back and forth and trying
to help with information.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're not here to
really intervene with us.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:84%
But they are here to
protect the Earth.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And they are here to help
the Earth in case something

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.120 align:middle line:84%
happens when like
cataclysmic events happen.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.520 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting
when there is a tsunami,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.260 align:middle line:90%
there's so many UFO reportings.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.881 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's always interesting
when a volcano erupts.

00:03:08.881 --> 00:03:12.560 align:middle line:84%
People start reporting
UFOs at a higher percentage

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.760 align:middle line:90%
than would normally happen.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.343 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the
tsunami still occurs.

00:03:15.343 --> 00:03:16.760 align:middle line:90%
The volcano still erupts.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they put a
thumb down it and stop it.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Why don't they get
involved with it?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, they do.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:84%
It could have been a lot
worse, I'll just say.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.250 align:middle line:90%
So they do work on--

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.130 align:middle line:84%
they have special
physics, and energies,

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.470 align:middle line:84%
and sciences that we
don't understand yet

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.570 align:middle line:84%
that can help the
Earth heal itself

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.300 align:middle line:84%
and actually mend these cracks
under the oceans and things

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.484 align:middle line:84%
like that that would be a
catastrophe for all of us.

00:03:41.484 --> 00:03:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we have
these four types that you

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:90%
say are living on this planet.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:90%
What do they look like?

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, one is
a reptilian race that's

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.830 align:middle line:90%
been here for quite a while.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's many different
kinds of reptilians, by the way.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And people come to me
actually look at this as,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.320 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, this is the evil
demonic race of this, this,

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.120 align:middle line:90%
and this.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And you have to understand
it's just like humans.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.400 align:middle line:84%
When I say someone looks
like someone from the ocean,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.800 align:middle line:84%
there's many different
versions of that.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like well, how many-- you
know, what do humans look like?

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.281 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
were to ask me that,

00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:20.614 align:middle line:84%
well, look how many different
races there are of humans.

00:04:20.614 --> 00:04:20.899 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my God.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:21.699 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And it's the same
thing with extraterrestrials,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.940 align:middle line:84%
whether they're the tall
whites or the smaller--

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The little alien grays
with the little black eyes.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.230 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think they're
robots, by the way.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Those are.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.130 align:middle line:90%
Those are programmed lifeforms.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.710 align:middle line:84%
You're absolutely right
those have been designed

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:84%
not only by us but by other
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:84%
to carry out special
missions and to also

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.440 align:middle line:84%
visit Earth and check on
things, just do some recon,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.170 align:middle line:84%
or take some DNA
from the animals

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:84%
so in case something does happen
they have a storage of this,

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.030 align:middle line:84%
because you wouldn't want
to send yourself there.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.430 align:middle line:84%
You'd rather send your
cyborg self there to do it--

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: First.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --because
they're not wanted here.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be understand
that since they are not

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.020 align:middle line:84%
wanted here by some of
these government states

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.447 align:middle line:90%
that they're going to die.

00:05:21.447 --> 00:05:22.780 align:middle line:90%
And they're going to get killed.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's why a
lot of these beings

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.600 align:middle line:84%
that are captured
self-destruct or they'll

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.840 align:middle line:84%
put it them in containers
that they instantly

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.900 align:middle line:90%
melt down to liquid.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.366 align:middle line:84%
And this is just because
they're not real.

00:05:37.366 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, do
all governments

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.580 align:middle line:84%
know and are they aware of
the fact that they're here?

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.480 align:middle line:84%
You know through the
programs you've been in.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, the government--

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But how many
groups knows this?

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh no.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:84%
All the countries
pretty much know this.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.650 align:middle line:10%
I mean, if you go and look back
at all of the amazing files

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:10%
that just recently
within the last decade,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.472 align:middle line:10%
all countries have
released their UFO files.

00:05:59.472 --> 00:06:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's like one of
the biggest stories,

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.880 align:middle line:90%
but no one talks about it.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, no one even mentions
these on documentaries at all.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.080 align:middle line:84%
Of course, my
colleagues that are

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.240 align:middle line:84%
in this community
and your colleagues,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.610 align:middle line:84%
they know and
they've studied this.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.380 align:middle line:84%
But there's been
one country that

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.090 align:middle line:90%
will not release the documents.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hello.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And why is that?

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It a good point.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.530 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned that
they walk among us.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.860 align:middle line:90%
Do they shape shift?

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how do they blend in?

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, no, I mean
they're human, like I said.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.382 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some of them.

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: They have human DNA.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.470 align:middle line:84%
But there are these
types of shape shifters.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.629 align:middle line:84%
And they can change
into anything.

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:40.420 align:middle line:84%
They can make themself
look like an animal.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:84%
They can make themselves look
like any type of ET race.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.200 align:middle line:84%
They have the ability to
change their atomic structure

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.609 align:middle line:84%
into almost anything,
kind of like you see the--

00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, they're
like chameleons?

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.320 align:middle line:90%
They're like chameleons.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They have that ability.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.436 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But these
are very highly

00:06:55.436 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:90%
evolved light beings by the way.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:middle line:84%
They're not here in
a malevolent way.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.830 align:middle line:90%
They're not like us.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:84%
They're completely
different than we are.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.110 align:middle line:84%
They only do things
to serve humanity,

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and to serve the universe,
and to serve the planets

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.480 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.826 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Emery, you've
mentioned the reptilian race.

00:07:13.826 --> 00:07:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And you've mentioned
that there's a race that

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.200 align:middle line:90%
looks somewhat human.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.730 align:middle line:90%
What about the other two?

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, there's like
ones that live in the ocean.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.837 align:middle line:84%
And they've been there, I
think, probably the longest.

00:07:25.837 --> 00:07:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aquatic ETs, basically?

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Very aquatic ETs.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:33.290 align:middle line:84%
They don't come to the surface
because they cannot handle too

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:34.090 align:middle line:90%
much light.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.040 align:middle line:90%
They're very sensitive to light.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.290 align:middle line:90%
And they have very large eyes.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And they have a very
bluish white body.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.740 align:middle line:90%
Some have gray bodies.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.790 align:middle line:90%
Some have a black color body.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And they are anywhere from
three to seven feet tall.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:84%
They have webbed types
of feet that are not

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.600 align:middle line:84%
jointed at the ankles,
kind of like a little

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.710 align:middle line:90%
like a little flipper.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:07.240 align:middle line:84%
They have this beautiful fin
though that covers their arms

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:90%
that are not very long.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a membrane that
sticks out like a fin.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.775 align:middle line:90%
But it moves very fluidly.

00:08:14.775 --> 00:08:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do
they come from?

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean are these
earthbound creatures?

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:19.280 align:middle line:90%
Were they always here?

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, we call these--

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.250 align:middle line:84%
the ones that live in the water,
we call them the Aquifarians.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And we do believe they came
from another water planet

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and that they have the ability
to also have teletransportation

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.110 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:38.659 align:middle line:84%
But they also have
a lower mindset.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:84%
But even though they're
very high conscious,

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle line:90%
they're very simple creatures.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, how did they get
here, in craft of some type?

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I don't
know how they got here.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.480 align:middle line:90%
Alls I know is they are here.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:90%
And we are monitoring them.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And we've been monitoring
them for some time.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And I even heard that
one of these creatures

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.610 align:middle line:84%
was actually found
by the military.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the pictures and
the videos of these beings.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:09.040 align:middle line:84%
But in the databases, there is a
huge amount of this information

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.480 align:middle line:90%
about this race.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're not
interfering with them.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.400 align:middle line:84%
We're treating it more of like
a biology thing where we're just

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.090 align:middle line:84%
watching them, and
studying them, and trying

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:22.010 align:middle line:84%
to understand, like you say,
where they're coming from.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:22.995 align:middle line:90%
We do have their DNA.

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But
they're intelligent.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Rather than being more fishlike,
they're more humanlike.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>> SMITH:Well, no.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:28.568 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm saying.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:31.810 align:middle line:84%
They're not as-- the
intelligence, from what we

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:36.190 align:middle line:84%
have gathered, is obviously
they're intelligent,

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.949 align:middle line:90%
but they're simple.

00:09:37.949 --> 00:09:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did we
come across them?

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.460 align:middle line:90%
Did we just stumble across them?

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.820 align:middle line:90%
Was there some program?

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, no.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:84%
We had created our own types
of submarines that were reverse

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.500 align:middle line:84%
engineered from
extraterrestrial craft that

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:59.260 align:middle line:84%
can form their own energetic
density field of magnetic flux

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:04.610 align:middle line:84%
field around these types of
craft that can go into very,

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:08.350 align:middle line:84%
very deep, deep waters, deeper
than what you see at "National

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:09.820 align:middle line:90%
Geographic" and these other--

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Deeper than our
traditional submarines.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Than our
traditional submarines.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And they also have drones
that can go very, very deep

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and run on their own
for weeks at a time,

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.160 align:middle line:90%
and then come back and report.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And we can see all
the recordings.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And we can see the
data that has collected

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:29.860 align:middle line:84%
in many different
wavelengths of light

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.080 align:middle line:84%
that we can't see
with our own eyes.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.610 align:middle line:84%
These supernatural cameras
that they have on these craft

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:41.500 align:middle line:84%
can record in complete darkness
for a very long distance.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And things are now
evolving to come out

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.640 align:middle line:84%
to the public, like
people are now having

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.900 align:middle line:90%
their own submarines.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And other organizations are
now traveling to the depths.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're starting
to see things.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to
see gigantic sharks.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:01.570 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to see fish
that are transparent that you

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.730 align:middle line:84%
can see their brain,
you know things

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:90%
like this, which is amazing.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the stuff
they're showing

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.510 align:middle line:84%
is going to really open the
eyes for the general public

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:84%
to realize that we are not
the only ones when we're just

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.230 align:middle line:84%
discovering new creatures
and fish every day.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these ETs
friendly or is there

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:90%
a potential problem?

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: As far as
I'm concerned and far

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:28.885 align:middle line:84%
as my experience with this,
they're very, very friendly.

00:11:28.885 --> 00:11:30.582 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of them?

00:11:30.582 --> 00:11:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, the ones
that I've worked with--

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:34.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --OK?

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a very big
possibility, of course.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.640 align:middle line:90%
The universe is large, you know.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:43.930 align:middle line:84%
I know of one horrible, horrible
ET race that is not very nice.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:47.320 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they do?

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.440 align:middle line:90%
The horrible ones.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's the earthlings.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.400 align:middle line:90%
You know, we are the ones--

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:53.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Us.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.928 align:middle line:90%
You think we're the bad ones.

00:11:54.928 --> 00:11:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, we
are the bad ones.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.520 align:middle line:84%
If we're not taking
care of each other

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:84%
or not taking care
of the planet,

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and we're chopping
each other's heads off,

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.750 align:middle line:84%
that's not a normal
conscious thing to do.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And to fight over something,
and to mislead young people

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.600 align:middle line:84%
into going into a war to think
they're fighting for something,

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and having them
on the front line,

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and having them killed off for
a corporation to make money

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.262 align:middle line:90%
is wrong.

00:12:24.262 --> 00:12:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, do
these ETs, Emery,

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.310 align:middle line:84%
think there's something
wrong with us,

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:90%
because you're absolutely right.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.890 align:middle line:84%
We are a warring group
of people on this planet

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.590 align:middle line:84%
These ETs, if
they're benevolent,

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.750 align:middle line:84%
must come here and
see this and say,

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.640 align:middle line:90%
what's wrong with these things?

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.540 align:middle line:84%
What's wrong with
these creatures?

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That's exactly
what they're doing.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
they care so much.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, these
groups of ETs that

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.440 align:middle line:84%
are monitoring the planet,
that are monitoring us, making

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.930 align:middle line:84%
sure that we don't
blow up the planet.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, one nuclear
bomb goes off,

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and it's really going to
destroy the entire planet, just

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.520 align:middle line:90%
one of them.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they're
creating bombs now

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.700 align:middle line:84%
that can do as much
damage as a nuclear bomb

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.590 align:middle line:84%
with no radiation,
which is very scary.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:13.120 align:middle line:84%
There are other planets out
there that started like we did.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And you know back in 1899
with Tesla Stubblefield

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.840 align:middle line:84%
where they created
free energy already,

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.914 align:middle line:84%
and the corporations
came down hard on them.

00:13:22.914 --> 00:13:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They couldn't
make money on it.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:29.270 align:middle line:84%
So for the last over
100 years now, we are--

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:30.070 align:middle line:90%
been suppressed.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.340 align:middle line:84%
We've actually could have--
imagine if back then we

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:84%
had anti-gravity and
free energy how beautiful

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.130 align:middle line:84%
and how clean this
planet would look today

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:44.020 align:middle line:84%
and how maybe the differences
between different races

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:48.430 align:middle line:84%
and countries would
not be such an issue.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:52.464 align:middle line:84%
I think science and the new
physics that are coming out

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and the new sciences
that are coming out

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.830 align:middle line:84%
are going to bring together,
I think, the countries

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:58.720 align:middle line:90%
in a more peaceful environment.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And also raising the
consciousness of the planet

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.340 align:middle line:90%
is very important.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think the ETs are
actually doing this.

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:10.330 align:middle line:84%
I think the universe has
energy that showers down

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:84%
upon us that allows us
to elevate ourselves

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.500 align:middle line:84%
into a new state of
consciousness every second.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it in the
children that are born today.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.200 align:middle line:90%
They're just amazing.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.830 align:middle line:90%
They're more intelligent.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.000 align:middle line:90%
They're more compassionate.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're caring.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: They're caring.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's important for the
families of these children

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:38.110 align:middle line:84%
to support this positivity
and not alienate anyone.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are we the
dominant force on this planet?

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.130 align:middle line:84%
You would think these
ETs would take over.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:43.930 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.388 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, like
I said, they're

00:14:45.388 --> 00:14:46.946 align:middle line:90%
not warmongering like we are.

00:14:46.946 --> 00:14:49.600 align:middle line:90%
What do we have that they need?

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Nothing they can create
anything they want.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.720 align:middle line:90%
They can go anywhere they want.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.177 align:middle line:84%
So they can just hang
out and vacation.

00:14:58.177 --> 00:15:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't we
go into war with them?

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:01.410 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we take them all out?

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, we've tried to.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, we have?

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We tried to get
some sarin gas in there.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.690 align:middle line:90%
And that backfired.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle line:90%
And many people were--

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.700 align:middle line:90%
many military guys--

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.152 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It backfired on us?

00:15:13.152 --> 00:15:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --were killed.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And they had gained
a lot of technology

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:17.900 align:middle line:90%
from these ant people.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.282 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Hopi Indians
talked about ant people.

00:15:21.282 --> 00:15:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Are we talking about
the same thing here?

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean the Hopi Indians
and all the tribes

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:30.670 align:middle line:84%
out there, including
the Zia Pueblo tribes--

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:34.340 align:middle line:84%
there's so many tribes up in
New Mexico and southern Colorado

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.480 align:middle line:90%
that have reported these things.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.220 align:middle line:84%
They have history-- actually
kept history of this

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:47.620 align:middle line:84%
in the writings and, of
course, on the rocks depicting

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.670 align:middle line:90%
of these people.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
look like ants?

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:50.920 align:middle line:90%
Big ants?

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.540 align:middle line:90%
They're segmented, but they--

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Creepy.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --but
they do have arms.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And they do have a face like
we do, but it is in the shape--

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big heads.

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: You know.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.350 align:middle line:90%
They're very large.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:90%
They have an skeleton.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's what supports them.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:90%
They don't have bones.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure exactly
what it's made of,

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.700 align:middle line:84%
but their exoskeleton
like an ant has.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're, of course, very
smart, very industrious.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And they have huge
tunnel systems

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.680 align:middle line:84%
out in southwest of
the United States

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.220 align:middle line:90%
and over in the Gobi Desert.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.210 align:middle line:90%
And they have technology too.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And they've been around
for quite a while.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:35.740 align:middle line:84%
There's also word that
they were once on Mars.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And so that was a
second-hand information

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.150 align:middle line:84%
that I heard through other
colleagues and reading

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:44.960 align:middle line:90%
about some certain things.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.180 align:middle line:90%
But yes, they are there.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.200 align:middle line:90%
They're here now.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.760 align:middle line:90%
They're still here.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.940 align:middle line:84%
We tried to attack
them and get them out.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think because
our government,

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.920 align:middle line:84%
with the advent of new
ground-penetrating radar,

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.130 align:middle line:84%
has now seen what's
living down there.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And they want the
technology they have.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we want them
out, like off the planet?

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:10.210 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.800 align:middle line:90%
They're not creating any havoc.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:90%
They're not destroying anything.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:18.730 align:middle line:84%
It's more of get in there and
I want something that you have,

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.316 align:middle line:90%
like we do with war.

00:17:21.316 --> 00:17:22.440 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's this whole--

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.981 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where do they live,
the ant people specifically?

00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:27.376 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Specifically,
in the southwest region

00:17:27.376 --> 00:17:28.250 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.006 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In mountains or where?

00:17:30.006 --> 00:17:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Underground.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of course,
the Great Sand Dunes.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.190 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge facility
there by Blanca Peak there

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:90%
and Crestone is the big one.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.150 align:middle line:90%
But it tunnels way down deeper.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And they have their own
transportation system

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.450 align:middle line:84%
that they're using to
get from here to there.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And they have already
developed teletransportation,

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.530 align:middle line:90%
things like this.

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I find this
utterly fascinating.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.770 align:middle line:10%
And you know Admiral
Byrd claims that he

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:00.500 align:middle line:10%
went into a hollow earth and
he saw all kinds of creatures.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might we be
talking about creatures

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.770 align:middle line:90%
one and the same that he saw?

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's possible.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.860 align:middle line:90%
But there is an inner earth.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:13.020 align:middle line:84%
There are huge areas of
pockets in the Earth that--

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:18.940 align:middle line:84%
and pockets in the water and
underground aquifers that

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:23.470 align:middle line:84%
are homes to amazing amount
of creatures that somehow get

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.810 align:middle line:84%
lost and end up on
terrestrial earth

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and are seen in the woods,
things like Bigfoot,

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:33.280 align:middle line:84%
and then call in and say
we see these creatures,

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and it looked like this, or it
looked like that, or something

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:40.380 align:middle line:84%
flying that was just
too big to be a bird.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes these things
do escape from these--

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:47.700 align:middle line:84%
not escape but accidentally
come to the surface.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
sightings of paranormal things

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.870 align:middle line:84%
that are around the
planet are actually

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:84%
just these creatures that
have emerged from caves

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.590 align:middle line:84%
or have accidentally
teletransported

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:03.820 align:middle line:84%
to an area on the planet
that they're being witnessed.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And we are just coming up
with names for them, which

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.752 align:middle line:90%
could be anything, like I said.

00:19:10.752 --> 00:19:11.551 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't some of
these entities living

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.650 align:middle line:90%
on top of the surface?

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:16.644 align:middle line:90%
Why are they underground?

00:19:16.644 --> 00:19:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, they are.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.620 align:middle line:84%
There's many entities that
are walking amongst us,

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:25.937 align:middle line:84%
and studying us, and working
with us, just like we're

00:19:25.937 --> 00:19:27.520 align:middle line:84%
working together
right here right now.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.728 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you one of them?

00:19:28.728 --> 00:19:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, I'm not.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:30.710 align:middle line:90%
I'll say this.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:90%
We all have ET genetics in us.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And some of us have more
extraterrestrial genetics

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:37.060 align:middle line:90%
than others.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And until they release the
extraterrestrial genetic

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:45.980 align:middle line:84%
database that I helped create,
then people are going to--

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.280 align:middle line:84%
people are going
to see, oh, well,

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.700 align:middle line:84%
I have more of this
race than that race.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.090 align:middle line:90%
And we're not just a human race.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget like when we do
testing of non-earth origin

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:02.790 align:middle line:84%
specimens, they
have human DNA too.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.240 align:middle line:90%
They're part human.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.480 align:middle line:84%
So I think the best way
to put this for everyone

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.640 align:middle line:84%
is I think everyone has
extraterrestrial DNA.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And everyone has a
percentage that they are

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.530 align:middle line:90%
more or less extraterrestrial.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did you do,
Emery, for the ET database?

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.064 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: As I was taking samples
from these beings, later on I

00:20:24.064 --> 00:20:25.480 align:middle line:84%
got a little bit
higher clearance.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.340 align:middle line:84%
They were allowing me to look
at different types of ways

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:35.980 align:middle line:84%
to categorize these beings
and categorizing the DNA.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And I helped write
that out what that was.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were
wondering how are we

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.580 align:middle line:84%
going to put this in
a program like an app,

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.100 align:middle line:84%
kind of like an
app that we could

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.480 align:middle line:84%
share with other
underground facilities.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So I was
part of that process.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.520 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just me.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.220 align:middle line:84%
It was a huge group
of people, about 20

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.030 align:middle line:84%
of us, that were
working on getting a way

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:05.750 align:middle line:84%
to store this in a safe way
off of Earth, by the way,

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:11.140 align:middle line:84%
on a type of satellite I'll
say, but still have access to it

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:84%
without using radio
frequency or the internet,

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:90%
because all that can be hacked.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.910 align:middle line:90%
Even back then they knew that.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is a time
where you have

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:22.840 align:middle line:84%
to understand we're
talking like MS DOS times,

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:27.460 align:middle line:84%
where the type of technology
that they were building it off

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:31.540 align:middle line:84%
of, they actually wanted it
to be old and not futuristic,

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.820 align:middle line:84%
because they knew the
more futuristic we

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:37.120 align:middle line:84%
got with the technologies
for building databases,

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.220 align:middle line:84%
that it would be
harder for hackers

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.130 align:middle line:90%
to relearn the old stuff.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So I was part of basically
categorizing that and helping

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.610 align:middle line:84%
the programmers
put it in a format

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:54.520 align:middle line:84%
and writing these smaller
programs to keep it encrypted

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.060 align:middle line:84%
and also to help keep
that database updated

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and work with other facilities
from around the planet that

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.230 align:middle line:84%
needed to do the same
thing, because if there was

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.680 align:middle line:84%
some sort of catastrophic
event and we lost all the data,

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.310 align:middle line:84%
that would not be good
for us for our evolution,

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:15.460 align:middle line:84%
because we need this data
to help evolve ourselves.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much technology
do we get from them?

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Pretty much all
of the technology we have--

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --today is
from outer space.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:26.770 align:middle line:84%
All these things are just things
that they have either given us,

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:28.870 align:middle line:84%
crashed here on purpose
so we would figure it

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:84%
out, or actually side by side
in the projects telling us

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.270 align:middle line:84%
this is something
you can design,

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:40.237 align:middle line:84%
and it could be safe and be used
for this, that, or the other.

00:22:40.237 --> 00:22:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.236 align:middle line:84%
You had mentioned, of
course, that governments

00:22:43.236 --> 00:22:44.110 align:middle line:90%
know about them.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And if governments
know about them,

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.430 align:middle line:84%
I have to assume big
business knows about them.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.686 align:middle line:84%
corporations, reversed
engineering, stealing ideas--

00:22:52.686 --> 00:22:54.310 align:middle line:84%
they've got to be
all involved in this.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:58.250 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, like Colonel
Corso said, they were--

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:10%
after the four crashes
here in Roswell

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:05.190 align:middle line:10%
and in San Antonio, Texas,
and other parts of New Mexico

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:08.270 align:middle line:10%
when we were shooting them
down with different frequency

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.630 align:middle line:10%
devices, the first
thing they did

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:16.820 align:middle line:10%
was gather up all the parts
and all the equipment.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And they cataloged
everything-- the military now.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the Army
and the Air Force later on.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:30.300 align:middle line:90%
And they would then give it to--

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:34.310 align:middle line:84%
they would go out and find
the best technicians, the best

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:37.430 align:middle line:84%
people in all of the
science community

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.730 align:middle line:84%
and the universe that were
good with circuitry and good

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:45.710 align:middle line:84%
with things that had a right
mindset that could handle

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:49.100 align:middle line:84%
looking at something and not
like freaking out and trying

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.410 align:middle line:84%
to say what is this
and how does it work.

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:53.440 align:middle line:90%
So Corso went out.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.590 align:middle line:90%
That was his job.

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:58.520 align:middle line:84%
The general gave him that
job to go out and find

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:03.410 align:middle line:84%
these few hundred amazing
people that were conscious

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.670 align:middle line:84%
and that were very
intelligent by the way,

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:08.840 align:middle line:90%
and say, hey, figure this out.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Duplicate it.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.150 align:middle line:90%
Duplicate it.

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to give
you money to do it.

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the secret
corporations were involved.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.640 align:middle line:90%
They started figuring this out.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.830 align:middle line:84%
They started making
a lot of money.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:84%
But the deal was that,
once they figured it out,

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:27.879 align:middle line:84%
they have to give it
back to the government.

00:24:27.879 --> 00:24:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
everything went to--

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We think
they gave it back.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.823 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, that's what
was supposed to happen.

00:24:32.823 --> 00:24:36.170 align:middle line:84%
But according to
Corso and others,

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:37.500 align:middle line:90%
that's not what happened.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.570 align:middle line:90%
They kept on to it.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And if they did
get something back,

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:45.080 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't give them all
the information to that.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And so the corporations
became, of course,

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.380 align:middle line:84%
these mega corporations that now
control the planet because they

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.530 align:middle line:84%
have a higher tech
than we do and probably

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:57.680 align:middle line:90%
their own military type thing.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.120 align:middle line:90%
And that's why we're here today.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, I think
it was Eisenhower who

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.752 align:middle line:90%
said before he retired said--

00:25:02.752 --> 00:25:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The industrial
military complex.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --be careful of the
military industrial complex.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:11.300 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, why doesn't
people respond to this?

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.690 align:middle line:84%
This is a very dangerous thing
that's still happening today

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.330 align:middle line:90%
and that needs to be looked at.

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:19.400 align:middle line:84%
They try to keep us
looking at, of course,

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.610 align:middle line:84%
the media and things
like this to make

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:25.410 align:middle line:84%
sure we don't really talk about
what we're talking about right

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:26.210 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's a problem that I
disagree with the corporations

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:37.790 align:middle line:84%
about over unity
devices and cures

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:42.500 align:middle line:84%
that they have found out that
they can make with frequencies.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.300 align:middle line:90%
And in the future it is coming.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:48.105 align:middle line:84%
It's just they're slowly
releasing it too slow.

00:25:48.105 --> 00:25:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And we don't need to
do that right now.

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:52.300 align:middle line:90%
We need to-- excuse me.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.400 align:middle line:90%
We need to do it today.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
sleep easier knowing

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:59.710 align:middle line:84%
these ETs are here
on this planet

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:01.910 align:middle line:90%
doing what they're doing?

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I personally don't
believe I would still be here

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:08.230 align:middle line:84%
if it wasn't for
extraterrestrial intervention

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and intervention from certain
government organizations that

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.340 align:middle line:84%
do have a feeling of what
the future could come to.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:22.080 align:middle line:90%
And there is a--

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:28.960 align:middle line:84%
how I feel, a very protective
light upon all of us, not just

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:29.760 align:middle line:90%
myself.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what do you
mean you wouldn't be here

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:32.640 align:middle line:90%
if it wasn't for them?

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I just think
I have a lot of protection

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.940 align:middle line:90%
from these extraterrestrials.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.536 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
looking out for me.

00:26:40.536 --> 00:26:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean somebody
could be out to get you?

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I mean it's
been already proven in the past

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:84%
that I've been
attacked many times,

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.560 align:middle line:84%
you know physically
and energetically.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there
was some interference

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.820 align:middle line:84%
to allow me to be
here today to express

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:04.020 align:middle line:84%
the truth and knowledge of all
the things that are out there.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you think this
all plays out in the future?

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.610 align:middle line:90%
What's it look like for the ETs?

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.576 align:middle line:90%
What's it look like for us?

00:27:10.576 --> 00:27:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There's going
to be some hard times.

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.490 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
some catastrophes.

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's OK, because
it's already happened.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've already been
through so much as humans.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And we have to look at where
are we going with that.

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:27.350 align:middle line:90%
And we are.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:32.220 align:middle line:84%
We are getting more evolved,
definitely technically advanced

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.220 align:middle line:90%
more ever since I've come out.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.430 align:middle line:84%
The-- the corporation's been
releasing amazing materials

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:40.242 align:middle line:84%
and things that I talk
about on the shows,

00:27:40.242 --> 00:27:41.700 align:middle line:84%
because they're
like, it's out now.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:42.500 align:middle line:90%
It's already open.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.582 align:middle line:84%
So now they're actually fighting
over who is going to get it.

00:27:45.582 --> 00:27:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is going
to be things that

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.660 align:middle line:84%
are going to help us survive
into the next millennia.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And that was my biggest gift
was to stay alive and be

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:56.910 align:middle line:84%
able to talk about
these technologies

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:02.190 align:middle line:84%
and then read about it three
months later in the business

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.770 align:middle line:84%
magazines and then
the national science

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:06.310 align:middle line:90%
magazines and things like this.

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So someone's listening
to us, George.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Somebody is.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And people
do want it out.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:15.030 align:middle line:84%
It's just we have to
do it in a safe way.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
I'm here speaking,

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:19.320 align:middle line:84%
because I really want to make
a change to help Earth and all

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.380 align:middle line:84%
the humans on the planet
to understand that there is

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:26.130 align:middle line:84%
so much hope coming our
way that we cannot give up,

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:28.122 align:middle line:90%
because we are an amazing race.

00:28:28.122 --> 00:28:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Emery, thank you for
being on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:32.160 align:middle line:90%
You're one of a kind, my friend.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, George.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Always a pleasure.

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for having me.
