>>EMERY SMITH: Today,
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.050 align:middle line:10%
we are here with Randy
Cramer who has knowledge

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.390 align:middle line:10%
about ETs living amongst us.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.710 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.252 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY CRAMER:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:29.252 --> 00:00:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you aware of any
ETs amongst us here on Earth?

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.563 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, we've
certainly been briefed

00:00:33.563 --> 00:00:38.090 align:middle line:84%
that we have ETs here on Earth
that both look so similar to us

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.700 align:middle line:84%
that, again, without
close examination,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.310 align:middle line:84%
or if you didn't know
what the differences were,

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't know.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.110 align:middle line:84%
But I've also heard of some
species that look very, very

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.480 align:middle line:84%
different from us and
are using some form

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.410 align:middle line:84%
of projected holograms so that
they look more like us as well.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the most fascinating
things that I've ever seen

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.210 align:middle line:84%
was someone who
used to work-- or I

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.860 align:middle line:84%
think they still
do work, security

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.030 align:middle line:90%
at a Casino in Las Vegas.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.340 align:middle line:90%
And they were looking at the--

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.570 align:middle line:84%
watching the camera
feed and these three ETs

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.320 align:middle line:84%
with white skin, bulbous heads
came in sat down at the table,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and one of them looked
up at the camera,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.130 align:middle line:90%
and then the camera went out.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.777 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly enough,
when he went down to the table

00:01:24.777 --> 00:01:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and asked the dealer,
hey, did you see

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.090 align:middle line:90%
those three guys at the table--

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:84%
those non-humans, he was like,
no, I didn't see them at all.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So somehow the camera
caught their actual image

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.010 align:middle line:84%
of what they
actually looked like,

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.200 align:middle line:84%
but they were able to somehow
project an image up close that

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.308 align:middle line:84%
made them not look
like extraterrestrials.

00:01:44.308 --> 00:01:46.850 align:middle line:84%
So whether that was a psionic
thing or a technological thing,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.000 align:middle line:84%
But I had seen the
photograph of that,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.890 align:middle line:84%
and I thought it was
absolutely fascinating

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.380 align:middle line:84%
that the camera caught what
they actually looked like,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.370 align:middle line:84%
but no one who was on the
floor saw the difference at all

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.390 align:middle line:84%
or saw three extraterrestrials
come into the Casino.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So why are they here?

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why do you think
they're actually living here?

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why'd they
even go to a Casino?

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.068 align:middle line:90%
What's your take on that?

00:02:08.068 --> 00:02:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Well, I would--

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.980 align:middle line:84%
from what I understand, the
numerous programs that we have

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.520 align:middle line:84%
around the world that are
developing technology, working

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.560 align:middle line:84%
on propulsion systems, in
many cases go back decades,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:84%
and from what I understand,
back in the early days,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.870 align:middle line:84%
it was not uncommon for people
to be working in a program

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.210 align:middle line:84%
to just all of a
sudden be approached

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.460 align:middle line:84%
by an extraterrestrial or a
group of extraterrestrials

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.840 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, we can help
you out with this in exchange

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.650 align:middle line:84%
for something, and that always
depends on what they want

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:84%
or what they need for how
that negotiation comes out.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.920 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of those
relationships started back

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.110 align:middle line:84%
in the 50s and the
60s, and they've

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.850 align:middle line:90%
continued to present day.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So in some cases, you
have advisors, engineers,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.040 align:middle line:84%
scientists who are helping
terrestrial programs.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.100 align:middle line:84%
So in some cases, they
obviously have some freedom

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.070 align:middle line:84%
to go on and off base,
and in the civilization

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.700 align:middle line:84%
depending on how visible
or not visible they are.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.600 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So they're hiding
kind of in plain sight

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:90%
and working amongst us.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And do we know if there
is another agenda?

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Who is controlling them
and where do they stay?

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Are they going back to
the ships in the evening?

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Are they actually
portraying to be humans

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.325 align:middle line:84%
and having homes and
working regular jobs?

00:03:26.325 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I would say the
answer to that probably depends

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.040 align:middle line:84%
on the species, who
they're working for,

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.630 align:middle line:90%
and how well they blend in.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.810 align:middle line:84%
I think there's some species
who probably live in houses

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle line:84%
or live in homes that
someone is paying for,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:84%
and, again, blend in just
like we do, and others of them

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:90%
probably are living on base--

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.290 align:middle line:84%
or maybe staying on their
ship and coming on and off

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.350 align:middle line:90%
for liberty like sailors do.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think they've
infiltrated any leadership

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.130 align:middle line:90%
positions on the planet?

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I've been
told that over time that

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.760 align:middle line:84%
has been a concern,
but that there has also

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:84%
been a concerted effort
to identify and remove

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.660 align:middle line:84%
those who have infiltrated
or impersonating

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.550 align:middle line:84%
terrestrial humans in
leadership positions.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:84%
So my understanding
is when we discover

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.070 align:middle line:84%
a situation like that, a
case file is written up.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:84%
It's handed over to a
special team to investigate.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And usually that being will
be given an option to leave

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.980 align:middle line:90%
or you know be dealt with.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't
voluntarily leave,

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.610 align:middle line:84%
then they'll either be
arrested or terminated.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What commander
gave you that protocol?

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.892 align:middle line:84%
Where did you learn that from
that that's how they do this?

00:04:39.892 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, my
Brigadier General.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Oh, OK.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Are there any ET groups that are
sanctioned by our governments

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.310 align:middle line:90%
to actually be here legally?

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Oh, yeah.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.920 align:middle line:84%
I would say most of the ones
who are here have papers

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and are given
permission to be here.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, we have
investigators and law

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:84%
enforcement personnel
whose job is

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.430 align:middle line:84%
to track down ETs who are
illegal aliens who aren't

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.760 align:middle line:84%
necessarily sanctioned to be
here, and, again, if necessary

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.347 align:middle line:84%
take them into custody,
and remove them.

00:05:10.347 --> 00:05:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about
exchange programs?

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:90%
Do you know anything about--

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely!

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.740 align:middle line:84%
We definitely have
exchange programs.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:84%
We definitely send other
personnel to other worlds

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.450 align:middle line:84%
to participate in
their process, and they

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.370 align:middle line:84%
send people here to help
participate in our process.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.413 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's absolutely
exchange programs.

00:05:27.413 --> 00:05:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you
give me some examples

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
to be more specific of
maybe the types of races

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.360 align:middle line:84%
that we are doing
exchange programs with?

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.600 align:middle line:90%
Are you aware of that?

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: There
was one ship that I

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.110 align:middle line:84%
was stationed on
for a while that

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.530 align:middle line:84%
had two extraterrestrial
tactical advisors.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.200 align:middle line:84%
They were bipedal
hominid, but not humanoid.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.300 align:middle line:84%
So they were very
distinctly different.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And when they were walking
up and down the hallways

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.610 align:middle line:90%
clearly not one of us.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:84%
But they were very kind,
very straightforward,

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.727 align:middle line:90%
and brilliant tacticians.

00:06:02.727 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And that was part
of an exchange program?

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.227 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: That was definitely
part of an exchange program.

00:06:07.227 --> 00:06:09.940 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is we
had sent tactical officers

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.070 align:middle line:84%
to train and study with
them on their world

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.640 align:middle line:84%
to learn their strategies
and their protocols,

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.150 align:middle line:84%
and they had sent a couple of
people to help us on the ground

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.780 align:middle line:90%
where we were working as well.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you know
of any ET communities

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.555 align:middle line:90%
that are living here on Earth?

00:06:25.555 --> 00:06:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Not above ground.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.888 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Maybe I should say--

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:30.540 align:middle line:84%
I was about to say, or maybe
I should say, inner Earth.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, if you want to
talk about above ground, not

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.300 align:middle line:90%
specifically.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.925 align:middle line:84%
If you want to talk
about below ground,

00:06:35.925 --> 00:06:38.200 align:middle line:84%
my understanding
is there's dozens.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you know what kind
of races that are down there?

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I mean I've
encountered them.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily have
a list of who's there.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.775 align:middle line:84%
But what sort of
occurring subterranean

00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:54.910 align:middle line:84%
in some of the larger pockets
in the honeycomb there

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:84%
are members of species from
other worlds that work there.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Some are transplanted citizens
so they're from somewhere else

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.980 align:middle line:84%
but they live here
now, and the same way

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.160 align:middle line:84%
like if you or I moved to France
we'd be you know Americans

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.960 align:middle line:90%
living in France.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're other
species living here.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.510 align:middle line:84%
They've come to
live here for jobs.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And because they like it here,
someone asked them to be here.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
The subterranean groups
tend to be intergalactically

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.152 align:middle line:90%
melded very, very well.

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:26.110 align:middle line:84%
So these are relationships
that have been going

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:90%
on for thousands of years.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know that I could
historically understand them

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.440 align:middle line:84%
well enough to
try and define how

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.650 align:middle line:84%
those relationships developed,
or who exactly we're

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.260 align:middle line:84%
talking about, or what list of
species we're talking about.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to get
information on that.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's at least a dozen
or more, a couple dozen.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Have you
personally ever met

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:84%
one of these species
from the underground?

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yes.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.010 align:middle line:90%
I've been down twice.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what did they look
like, and what kind of race

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:52.810 align:middle line:90%
were they?

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I actually
met Raptors,

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.620 align:middle line:84%
the subterranean indigenous
reptoids on planet Earth

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.420 align:middle line:90%
who are from here.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.530 align:middle line:90%
They developed here.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:03.592 align:middle line:90%
They evolved here.

00:08:03.592 --> 00:08:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And they've been
living underground

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.175 align:middle line:90%
for a very, very long time.

00:08:06.175 --> 00:08:10.060 align:middle line:84%
So a reptoid is a term to
describe any general species

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.890 align:middle line:90%
of a reptilian origin.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.480 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
the Raptors, we're

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.410 align:middle line:84%
talking about a specific
indigenous terrestrial species

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:22.120 align:middle line:84%
that has evolved from
dinosaurs, and essentially went

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.340 align:middle line:84%
subterranean a very,
very long time ago.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So they tend to have
longer, thinner legs.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:32.490 align:middle line:84%
They tend to have a long curved
neck with a longer snout.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.679 align:middle line:84%
They're-- I wouldn't go
so far to say is that

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:36.640 align:middle line:90%
they're friendly.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.030 align:middle line:84%
I would go so far as to say
that they're not hostile.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:84%
But people are given
sort of general warnings

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.850 align:middle line:84%
to not wander into
their territory,

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.740 align:middle line:84%
because you might end
up food if you run

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.550 align:middle line:90%
into the wrong group of people.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.540 align:middle line:84%
We definitely have a interactive
relationship with them,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:84%
and a participating, cooperative
relationship in bringing

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.680 align:middle line:90%
balance to the surface.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.285 align:middle line:84%
So their main concern
is as we inbalance

00:09:03.285 --> 00:09:05.410 align:middle line:84%
what's happening on the
surface that that threatens

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:06.740 align:middle line:90%
the planet as a whole.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Now their subterranean
civilizations

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.670 align:middle line:84%
will survive regardless,
but they have an interest in

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.262 align:middle line:84%
whether or not the surface
world is healthy or not.

00:09:15.262 --> 00:09:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And so, the worse
it gets, the more

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.220 align:middle line:84%
they have to communicate
to us, uh, you can't just

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:90%
destroy life on the surface.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.390 align:middle line:84%
You need to fix that or we'll
take some action to fix it

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.190 align:middle line:90%
if you don't.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And who is
receiving that intel?

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So the extraterrestrials
know this is going on.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And the
extraterrestrials

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:84%
that are on the surface
know this is going on.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Some of them may be in
a position of leadership

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.358 align:middle line:84%
that can maybe express
this problem we have?

00:09:42.358 --> 00:09:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I mean,
they certainly have

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.310 align:middle line:90%
a social political structure.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And so, their
leadership communicates

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:50.770 align:middle line:84%
with our leadership,
and they cooperate

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle line:84%
for mutual gain and mutual
benefit for the planet

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.362 align:middle line:90%
and both species as a whole.

00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Through
my investigations,

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.760 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed that these
underground facilities

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.360 align:middle line:84%
and these pockets, these inner
Earth pockets and also bases

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.730 align:middle line:84%
that are on top of the
planet that you can't

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.640 align:middle line:84%
see that are cloaked with
these extraterrestrials

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:84%
are utilizing technology
to easily move back

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.270 align:middle line:90%
and forth through the universe.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And what is that
technology, and is it

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.520 align:middle line:84%
similar to the technology you
used to get into inner Earth?

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It tends to be
wormhole jump gate technology,

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.890 align:middle line:90%
is my understanding of it.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What is a jump gate?

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: A wormhole.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.870 align:middle line:84%
So if an entry point
opened over there,

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.697 align:middle line:84%
an exit point could open on
the other side of the grounds

00:10:39.697 --> 00:10:42.030 align:middle line:84%
here, or on the other end of
the planet, or on the moon,

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.620 align:middle line:84%
or on another planet
our solar system,

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.870 align:middle line:84%
or on the other
end of the galaxy,

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and the distance separating
those two doorways

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.920 align:middle line:84%
is really about a foot, instead
of light years, or miles,

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.720 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.040 align:middle line:84%
So you can go entry
in one doorway,

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.410 align:middle line:84%
come out the other
nearly instantaneously

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:02.903 align:middle line:90%
over just about any distance.

00:11:02.903 --> 00:11:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And that's how you
got down to inner Earth?

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.153 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yes, absolutely.

00:11:06.153 --> 00:11:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And why were
you in inner Earth?

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I had to
sign some paperwork

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.040 align:middle line:84%
and swear an oath
in front of a judge.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And were
there extraterrestrials

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.160 align:middle line:90%
there that you witnessed?

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: It was a Raptor judge.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.590 align:middle line:84%
So it was basically a
terrestrial personnel,

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.980 align:middle line:84%
a member of ARB services
who escorted me there,

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.290 align:middle line:84%
and we waited outside the court
room, which nobody was in.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.680 align:middle line:84%
But then, when it was
ready, when it was time,

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.180 align:middle line:84%
I went in and stood
in front of him.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me some questions,
made me you know raise my hand

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.760 align:middle line:84%
and swear, and then sign some
papers, got a thumbprint,

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.283 align:middle line:90%
and then I was on my way.

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was that to get
more access to other places

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.520 align:middle line:90%
in the galaxy or?

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It was to
grant me a authority

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.640 align:middle line:84%
under their legal
system, which is global.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So it actually was able to
extend my legal authority

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.545 align:middle line:84%
beyond our own federal system
into a global legal network.

00:11:59.545 --> 00:12:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tell me more
about the Raptors

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:02.610 align:middle line:90%
and their legal authority.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, they've been
here longer than we have.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.760 align:middle line:84%
So their legal authority is a
bit bigger and a bit broader.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So in order to have
a larger authority

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:15.870 align:middle line:84%
for investigative powers
that they wanted to give me,

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.170 align:middle line:84%
it was important to essentially
go through that process

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:23.100 align:middle line:84%
for me to swear, promise,
sign, thumbprint to them

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:84%
so that I was sanctioned
under their legal authority,

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.860 align:middle line:84%
under their legal
umbrella, which

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.570 align:middle line:84%
was bigger than
the legal umbrella

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.360 align:middle line:84%
that my people were able
to give me clearance for.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.400 align:middle line:84%
So it was an extra
clearance, extra authority

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.450 align:middle line:90%
given to me by them.

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Let's jump into some
other ETs not from inner Earth,

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.810 align:middle line:84%
but either on the surface
or around the planet

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.820 align:middle line:90%
that you've been exposed to.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, I mean I
have encountered Sasquatch

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.160 align:middle line:90%
three times in the wild.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.690 align:middle line:84%
They are not native
to this planet.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.040 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
from somewhere else,

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.082 align:middle line:84%
but they've been here for
a very, very long time.

00:12:55.082 --> 00:12:59.230 align:middle line:84%
My understanding over 400,000
years or something like that.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is their
home, but it's not

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:02.730 align:middle line:90%
where they're originally from.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.480 align:middle line:84%
So they are originated as
an offworld species that

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.520 align:middle line:84%
have come here and
transplanted themselves,

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and highly intelligent,
highly psionic,

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.470 align:middle line:84%
the ability to blink
in and out of space.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.630 align:middle line:90%
And they're hilarious though.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.070 align:middle line:84%
What I found was the most
interesting and surprising

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:21.870 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.820 align:middle line:84%
They have this great
sense of humor.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.860 align:middle line:90%
They love to laugh.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.540 align:middle line:90%
They love to joke around.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Half the time if you run
into them in the wild,

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.590 align:middle line:84%
they're kind of
basically drawing you

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.320 align:middle line:84%
into their game
of hide and seek.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, they're
really just they're

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.980 align:middle line:84%
super playful, and super
fun, hyper intelligent.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.250 align:middle line:84%
But, again, you don't see them
if they don't want you to see,

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:84%
they don't leave
footprints if they

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.730 align:middle line:90%
don't want to leave footprints.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.530 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you see
a footprint it's not

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:84%
because they accidentally
left it there,

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.010 align:middle line:84%
it's because they
consciously chose

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:57.077 align:middle line:84%
to make a stomp in the ground
on purpose, because they

00:13:57.077 --> 00:13:59.160 align:middle line:84%
can run through the woods
without leaving a print.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Very comical.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah,
they're hilarious.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.110 align:middle line:90%
They're absolutely hilarious.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And they
have the ability

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.630 align:middle line:84%
to phase in and phase out, and
that's why you can't get them.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, I've watched
them pop out from behind a tree

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.100 align:middle line:84%
and then disappear as quickly
as I looked over and saw them.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Absolutely,
I can attest to that.

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yeah.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: 100%.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.532 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, they're
brilliant and hilarious.

00:14:22.532 --> 00:14:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tell us about
these Tall Whites.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.735 align:middle line:84%
They're seen in Ontario and
in other parts of the planet.

00:14:27.735 --> 00:14:29.610 align:middle line:84%
If you know about this,
but these Tall Whites

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.600 align:middle line:90%
have been seen in public.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Sure.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Is that an
extraterrestrial?

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, my understanding
is they're a hybrid.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.390 align:middle line:84%
They're a
terran-extraterrestrial hybrid

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:84%
that was created to be
an intermediary species.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.860 align:middle line:84%
So the species-- the
originator species

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.060 align:middle line:84%
created hybridization so that
the hybrids could communicate

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and associate with us in a
way that was more separate

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.940 align:middle line:90%
by the original species.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:06.420 align:middle line:84%
So from my understanding,
it's one of the offshoots

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.050 align:middle line:84%
of the Zeta Reticulans,
and that they created

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:13.860 align:middle line:84%
a human-zeta hybrid, that
again, these Tall Whites that

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.020 align:middle line:90%
are an intermediary for them.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what is their
position here you think?

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I've been
told it's mixed.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So I've been told that in some
cases they're very helpful,

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:26.880 align:middle line:84%
but I've also been
told in some cases

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:31.770 align:middle line:84%
that they can be A-holes
without you know trying to be

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.920 align:middle line:90%
more descriptive than that.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's not very
black and white.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.990 align:middle line:84%
They can be friendly,
but apparently they're

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:41.640 align:middle line:90%
kind of hypersensitive.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And so, you can find yourself on
the wrong end of a beam weapon

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:51.180 align:middle line:84%
if you offend them, or
step on someone's toes,

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.300 align:middle line:84%
or step in their
path the wrong way,

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.730 align:middle line:84%
or standing in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.040 align:middle line:84%
They have some weird
social protocols

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.600 align:middle line:84%
that, my understanding,
people who

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.250 align:middle line:84%
interact with them
on a regular basis

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:04.650 align:middle line:84%
have to be very
clearly briefed upon

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:08.240 align:middle line:84%
or serious injury
could befall them.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What are
they doing here?

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: My understanding
for the most part

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:20.840 align:middle line:84%
is helping to bring us some
more advanced technology while,

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.400 align:middle line:84%
again, getting
something in return.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And most of the Zetas what
they really seem to want

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.400 align:middle line:84%
are some of our DNA
so that they can

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.810 align:middle line:84%
regain some connection to
their spiritual consciousness.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:36.380 align:middle line:84%
They've evolved so
intellectually far from

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:41.090 align:middle line:84%
that, that rather than, oh,
let's spend the next 10,000

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:43.620 align:middle line:84%
years meditating and
spiritually evolving ourselves.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.040 align:middle line:84%
They're like, well, actually
we have masters of genetics,

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.130 align:middle line:84%
why don't we just find a
species that's more spiritual,

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:53.120 align:middle line:84%
borrow their DNA, and become
more spiritual by hybridizing

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.500 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's not necessarily
an evil intent.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:03.680 align:middle line:84%
It just often is conducted
in a way that is not

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.030 align:middle line:90%
thoughtful or compassionate.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.180 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes people have
these negative experiences

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.270 align:middle line:84%
and think that maybe they're
being evil or harmed.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.740 align:middle line:84%
It's really just kind of
a lack of consideration.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.369 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they hate
us or want to harm us.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.920 align:middle line:84%
They just don't necessarily
have the same compassion

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.460 align:middle line:84%
or consideration to our
suffering or discomfort.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So they really just see
the goal of the agenda

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.230 align:middle line:84%
of acquiring this
genetic material,

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:31.220 align:middle line:84%
being able to successfully
fuse it with their own DNA

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.520 align:middle line:84%
in order to create these
hybrid children, who

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.630 align:middle line:84%
they see as this next
evolutionary step for them.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:43.010 align:middle line:84%
They would like to see their
current genetic existence

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:46.940 align:middle line:84%
disappear completely and for
them to completely transfer

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.630 align:middle line:84%
and transform themselves
into this new hybrid species

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.500 align:middle line:90%
that they've been constructing.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very interesting
way to think of that a species

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:58.910 align:middle line:84%
goal is to actually
extinct themselves

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:02.150 align:middle line:84%
by creating a different
evolutionary line,

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and taking that line, and
then extincting the line

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.950 align:middle line:84%
that they're on because
they realize they're just

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:07.880 align:middle line:90%
on the wrong track.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.005 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: How many hybrids
do you think are actually

00:18:10.005 --> 00:18:11.840 align:middle line:90%
out there on the surface?

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Or are they working together as
a collective all these species?

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Or are doing their
own separate missions?

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: It's got to be
in the tens of thousands

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.000 align:middle line:90%
or upwards of 100,000 or more.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.370 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have specific
numbers on that right now,

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.632 align:middle line:90%
but it's got to be a lot.

00:18:27.632 --> 00:18:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And are they working
together these species,

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.820 align:middle line:90%
or do you think they're just--

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh, I think
sometimes they do,

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:84%
and I think sometimes
they compete, and I

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.290 align:middle line:84%
think sometimes they don't
necessarily like each other.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:84%
But, again, not
everybody gets along so.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: There's talk out
there of extraterrestrials

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:47.690 align:middle line:90%
that can shapeshift.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:48.815 align:middle line:90%
Are you aware of any these?

00:18:48.815 --> 00:18:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Yes, absolutely.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's a plasmid
species, which is--

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.680 align:middle line:90%


00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't how describe them.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:01.510 align:middle line:84%
If you were to imagine
a gelatinous life

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:05.370 align:middle line:84%
form with neon
lights inside of it.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:06.830 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of what
they look like.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:11.900 align:middle line:84%
But they have the ability
to conform to just about

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.700 align:middle line:84%
any external shape
so that they can

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:18.590 align:middle line:84%
mimic being a human being, or a
Zeta Reticulant, or Sasquatch,

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:22.160 align:middle line:84%
or a dolphin, or
just about anything

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.460 align:middle line:84%
that's within a
relative size or scope.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.550 align:middle line:84%
They can't shrink
down to cat size,

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.980 align:middle line:84%
or expand necessarily
to elephant size.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.470 align:middle line:84%
But anything that's
comparable mass

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.500 align:middle line:84%
in size they can basically
shapeshift and hold that

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.270 align:middle line:84%
form for an
incredibly long time.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.992 align:middle line:84%
They can hold a form
for hours or days.

00:19:40.992 --> 00:19:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What's their agenda?

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.670 align:middle line:90%
Where did they come from?

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.335 align:middle line:90%
Why are they here?

00:19:45.335 --> 00:19:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: The plasmids
that I'm aware of tend

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.360 align:middle line:84%
to be mercenaries, because
one of the best ways

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.790 align:middle line:84%
to assassinate someone
is to camouflage yourself

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.390 align:middle line:84%
as something else, get close,
and then stab, kill, whatever.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So they tend to be very well
paid assassins, because that's

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.090 align:middle line:90%
what they're good at.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:05.030 align:middle line:84%
So they're mercenaries there
has been a concerted effort

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:09.020 align:middle line:84%
to expel them from the
terrestrial sphere,

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and we certainly had some
incidents a few years back

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.010 align:middle line:84%
where some of them were
trying to leave and or escape,

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.530 align:middle line:84%
and we were acting to shoot
them down, or track them

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:20.450 align:middle line:84%
down, and hunt them
while they were

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:22.610 align:middle line:84%
going below the surface of
the ocean, and so forth.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:25.460 align:middle line:84%
It was it was a bit
of a deal for a while.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Who sent the
mercenaries, number one,

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.950 align:middle line:90%
and how do you--

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.100 align:middle line:84%
how did we destroy
those types of races?

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, I think that
in our travels of meeting

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:42.350 align:middle line:84%
other beings someone
encountered them and decided

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:46.540 align:middle line:84%
to tell someone else about
them who said, oh, let's

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.700 align:middle line:90%
hire those guys to do this job.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.492 align:middle line:90%
So as far as they're concerned--

00:20:50.492 --> 00:20:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: It's very personal
corporate probably.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, it's all
about the payment for them.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.160 align:middle line:84%
As long as they
get paid what they

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.650 align:middle line:84%
consider an adequate
compensation,

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.360 align:middle line:90%
they'll take any job.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We have heard
that the reptoids also

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.670 align:middle line:84%
can shapeshift and stay in this
shapeshifting whatever they

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:14.080 align:middle line:84%
choose, a human, and
possibly even infiltrate

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.007 align:middle line:84%
our military or
political government.

00:21:16.007 --> 00:21:17.090 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard about this?

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:19.423 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: There's definitely
a couple of reptoid species

00:21:19.423 --> 00:21:24.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm familiar with that have
what I would call a very

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.720 align:middle line:84%
localized chameleon or
shapeshifting ability that

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.680 align:middle line:90%
is limited to the dermis.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.800 align:middle line:84%
So they're really just
changing their skin,

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.370 align:middle line:90%
the surface of their skin.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So, again, if it's
comparable size,

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.480 align:middle line:84%
the ability to just
change externally

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.980 align:middle line:84%
so that they look
like a human being

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.710 align:middle line:84%
is completely feasible,
completely possible.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, we've had some
issues with every once

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:84%
in a while finding those beings
mimicking or impersonating

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:90%
political figures.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So you actually
went out on missions

00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.470 align:middle line:90%
to hunt these guys down?

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Not me
personally, but I

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:03.850 align:middle line:84%
am aware that we have
engaged in those missions

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:06.257 align:middle line:84%
to hunt them down
and deal with them.

00:22:06.257 --> 00:22:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Dealing
with them means what?

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Do we capture them, put
them in some sort of prison,

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.640 align:middle line:90%
or what happens to these?

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.087 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well,
my understanding--

00:22:14.087 --> 00:22:16.240 align:middle line:84%
it depends on their
level of hostility

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:21.640 align:middle line:84%
and or intellectual
cooperative tendencies.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.340 align:middle line:84%
So if a species is
considered to be someone

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:28.180 align:middle line:84%
that you can go, wait a minute,
and then have a conversation,

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.050 align:middle line:84%
and say, I got
you, you got to go.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And they're, OK, you
got me I got to go,

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:33.490 align:middle line:90%
then that's what you do.

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:37.030 align:middle line:84%
But if you know that species to
have a reputation that that's

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.070 align:middle line:84%
not going to work, then
it's they're either

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.780 align:middle line:84%
going to be arrested
or terminated,

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and that really is a command
decision of the commander

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.820 align:middle line:90%
in charge of that operation.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.618 align:middle line:84%
That would be up to them based
on the protocols and parameters

00:22:48.618 --> 00:22:50.410 align:middle line:84%
that they're given for
their job, what they

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:52.157 align:middle line:90%
think is the best thing to do.

00:22:52.157 --> 00:22:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why do you believe
all these ETs come and visit

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.550 align:middle line:90%
Earth and are amongst us?

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.830 align:middle line:90%
What's your opinion on that?

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.360 align:middle line:90%
Why are they actually all here?

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And what's so
important about Earth?

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:05.260 align:middle line:90%
What's so important about us?

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, my
understanding of that,

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:12.110 align:middle line:90%
is that planets at their--

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:17.050 align:middle line:84%
in their core somewhere have
an actual physical location

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:20.530 align:middle line:84%
where memory is stored
like a hard drive.

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I say memory, I
mean every single thing that

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.260 align:middle line:84%
has ever occurred
on that planet ever

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.680 align:middle line:84%
is recorded into that sort
of hard drive of memory

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.020 align:middle line:90%
somewhere down in the core.

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Now there are a small
number of worlds that are--

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:39.070 align:middle line:84%
we call them library
planets, and not--

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.640 align:middle line:84%
they not only stored data
from their own memory system,

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.650 align:middle line:84%
from their own
planetary experience,

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:48.010 align:middle line:84%
but they have copies
of other memories

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:50.650 align:middle line:84%
and other hard drives
from other planets.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:54.280 align:middle line:84%
So in case anything happens
to one of those planets,

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.230 align:middle line:84%
that memory of
genetic information,

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.800 align:middle line:84%
historical information
is stored somewhere else.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.380 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is Earth
is a library planet.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So there like a
massive amount of data

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.550 align:middle line:84%
that is beyond your
brain or my brain

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:12.760 align:middle line:84%
to even comprehend like
how much data that is.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:17.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's just say that the
value of that information

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:19.480 align:middle line:90%
is beyond priceless.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And so, any species
that understands

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:25.810 align:middle line:84%
that there is a potential
for them to get access

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:30.000 align:middle line:84%
to that information
might spare no expense,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.680 align:middle line:84%
whether friendly or hostile, in
order to gain access to that.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.430 align:middle line:84%
So certain species may have
decided it's best for them

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:39.928 align:middle line:84%
to be friendly with us to
try and get a library card,

00:24:39.928 --> 00:24:42.220 align:middle line:84%
where there may be other
species that would rather just

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.366 align:middle line:90%
steal books from the library.

00:24:44.366 --> 00:24:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And where on Earth
do you think this is located?

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.350 align:middle line:84%
I know it's not like, of
course, a building you go to.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Through my experience there
using the granite and crystal

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.670 align:middle line:84%
formations of the
Inner Earth to record

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:00.970 align:middle line:84%
in the hard drives
of other planets too,

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and other planets
done the same for us,

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:07.270 align:middle line:84%
and we were able to access
that and go back, let's

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:11.860 align:middle line:84%
say next week go back to this
time, this space and time,

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and actually see us and actually
hear everything we just said.

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:16.870 align:middle line:90%
And we could do that--

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:19.770 align:middle line:84%
we can do that 20,
30 years back now.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Oh millions
of years back.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.760 align:middle line:90%
So it records everything.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.093 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: So you know about this.

00:25:24.093 --> 00:25:25.220 align:middle line:90%
So where-- is it that?

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.020 align:middle line:90%
Where is this?

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Yeah, it's basically
a mineral memory system.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So different granite, gold, and
crystalline mineral structures

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:42.073 align:middle line:84%
hold most of that information
and most of that memory,

00:25:42.073 --> 00:25:42.990 align:middle line:90%
from my understanding.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's down
pretty far, so it's

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.870 align:middle line:84%
below what we would consider
to be the honeycomb space.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:51.730 align:middle line:90%
And then, there's another--

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:55.000 align:middle line:84%
there's a second honeycomb
layer underneath the sort

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.250 align:middle line:84%
of what we think of as
the Agartha Network, which

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.680 align:middle line:84%
is this sort of first
honeycomb layer.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:03.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a secondary
honeycomb layer that's--

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel at liberty
to discuss in this forum,

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.140 align:middle line:84%
but let's just say that it
gets really weird down there,

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:13.130 align:middle line:84%
and that the memory system
is somewhere beneath that.

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And that you would have to get
through this secondary layer

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:18.290 align:middle line:84%
to get to that,
and let's just say

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:21.680 align:middle line:84%
that what lives there
is not likely to let

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.367 align:middle line:84%
you get through that without
very specific permission.

00:26:25.367 --> 00:26:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: What lives there?

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I don't feel at
liberty to discuss that

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.550 align:middle line:90%
at this time and in this forum.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Why can't
you answer us on that?

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:34.898 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHS]

00:26:34.898 --> 00:26:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I think
the simplest answer

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:43.430 align:middle line:84%
is that certain things for
people are easier to believe

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:45.320 align:middle line:90%
or more difficult to believe.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:49.310 align:middle line:84%
If I were to try and explain
what I understand exists there,

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.370 align:middle line:84%
there are some people
that would simply--

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.240 align:middle line:84%
it would damage my
credibility because they

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.240 align:middle line:84%
would think that I was
describing something that

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.430 align:middle line:90%
couldn't even possibly exist.

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.860 align:middle line:84%
So rather than try
and explain something

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:03.770 align:middle line:84%
to people that is beyond
their ability to comprehend,

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:06.080 align:middle line:90%
I would rather not go there.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: That's a great
answer and I agree with you.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we're just
not ready for it.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Let's just say
they're big and they're weird.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What about ETs
living in the oceans?

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:17.882 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:27:17.882 --> 00:27:19.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean we certainly
know that there

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.560 align:middle line:84%
are species of
whale and porpoise

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.860 align:middle line:84%
that are not from here that
are from Sirius B. The Dogon

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Tribe certainly has a historical
record of spaceships coming

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:32.300 align:middle line:84%
down and porpoises coming
out and talking to them that

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.460 align:middle line:84%
probably goes back a
couple of thousand years

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:35.430 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:39.030 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that they
didn't all come at once.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:42.710 align:middle line:84%
So maybe a certain
cetacean species

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:46.370 align:middle line:84%
showed up 50,000 years ago,
and another one showed up

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:49.710 align:middle line:84%
10,000 years ago, and another
one showed up 2,000 years ago.

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And there are
certainly some species

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.520 align:middle line:84%
who have chosen to live down
near the bottom of the ocean,

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.090 align:middle line:84%
or down in large cave
systems or so forth,

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:01.640 align:middle line:84%
because they can take their
ships down there and park,

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.500 align:middle line:84%
and it's a perfectly
good place to stay

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.930 align:middle line:90%
where humans don't hang out.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:09.093 align:middle line:84%
So it's very safe out of
the way place for them.

00:28:09.093 --> 00:28:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you aware of any
bases or portals down there?

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: There
absolutely are bases down.

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.750 align:middle line:90%
We have built bases down there.

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials have
built bases down there.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Portals I've not
been briefed on,

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:21.890 align:middle line:84%
but I am to understand
that they're there.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:22.870 align:middle line:90%
That they exist.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.245 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What
about the locations

00:28:24.245 --> 00:28:29.632 align:middle line:84%
of these extraterrestrial bases,
and where are they living?

00:28:29.632 --> 00:28:30.590 align:middle line:90%
What part of the Earth?

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.298 align:middle line:84%
What oceans is what
I'm trying to get at?

00:28:32.298 --> 00:28:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: All over.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's actually a
very interesting history

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:40.340 align:middle line:84%
in the Solomon Islands, where
the natives there talk about

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.120 align:middle line:90%
this other city that's--

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.140 align:middle line:84%
they point off the coast
down into the water

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.670 align:middle line:84%
and go, well, that's
where the gods live,

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:47.820 align:middle line:90%
down there underwater.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's definitely
some cultures

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.480 align:middle line:84%
around the world that have
had these relationships,

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.250 align:middle line:84%
and know where some
of these things

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:57.440 align:middle line:84%
are, and reference them in
their cultural mythology

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.240 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's one that
it's certainly

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:02.810 align:middle line:84%
been referenced more than
once both historically

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:04.577 align:middle line:84%
and by modern
understanding, but I

00:29:04.577 --> 00:29:06.660 align:middle line:84%
would suggest they're
peppered all over the place.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:09.320 align:middle line:90%
There is no here and not there.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.620 align:middle line:90%
They're peppered all over.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are there
any ETs out there

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.700 align:middle line:84%
that you've met that claim
to have human origins?

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:20.120 align:middle line:90%


00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: I mean there are
species that we understand

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.090 align:middle line:84%
to have some common
origins with us,

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:29.450 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know that I'm
aware of a species that

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:33.830 align:middle line:84%
says that we're their origin,
or that they're evolved,

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:36.087 align:middle line:84%
or that they're from
here, or from us,

00:29:36.087 --> 00:29:37.670 align:middle line:84%
and went somewhere
else and came back.

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not familiar
with any species

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.300 align:middle line:90%
that has that relationship.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean there isn't, but
I'm not familiar with anyone.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.797 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Are you familiar
with a common source

00:29:45.797 --> 00:29:47.150 align:middle line:90%
that we have with other ETs.

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:50.950 align:middle line:84%
You did mention how we
almost kind of look the same

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.310 align:middle line:90%
on some of these planets.

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:54.350 align:middle line:90%
So what's your answer to that?

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:57.745 align:middle line:84%
Why are we so similar to
so many species out there?

00:29:57.745 --> 00:29:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Our understanding
is two reasons to that.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:03.210 align:middle line:84%
One is common biological
genetic ancestry,

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:05.140 align:middle line:90%
which is very intermixed.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So I mean we have dozens or
more sources of genetic origin

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.130 align:middle line:90%
that come into our species.

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And so, some of those species
have been to other planets,

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and interbred, and
intermixed their genetics

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:21.000 align:middle line:90%
with other species.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.890 align:middle line:90%
So those are common ancestors.

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:25.040 align:middle line:84%
But the second reason
is, again, this thing

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:29.990 align:middle line:84%
is I find very curious which
is that the universe repeats

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.040 align:middle line:84%
successful mathematical
operations.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes we can
track where there's

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:38.300 align:middle line:84%
a common ancestor, and
other times it just

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.990 align:middle line:84%
appears as if there's a
parallel and yet completely

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:44.570 align:middle line:84%
separate path of evolution
that is repeating

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:47.210 align:middle line:84%
a successful
mathematical pattern.

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you notice
that most of these ETs

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:54.140 align:middle line:84%
have that five star pattern of
a head, two arms, and two legs?

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Again, from
who we interact with I'd

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.400 align:middle line:90%
say that that happens a lot.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:03.320 align:middle line:84%
But I've certainly seen species
that defy that description.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.600 align:middle line:90%
So I would say, again--

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.670 align:middle line:84%
and we're interacting
with species, again, who

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:10.370 align:middle line:84%
are similar to us
for trade purposes,

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:13.040 align:middle line:84%
so maybe more of
the species that we

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.280 align:middle line:84%
interact with than don't
might conform to that pattern.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:20.660 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think I could
say that in general,

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.820 align:middle line:84%
like all life in the
galaxy or that we know

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.970 align:middle line:84%
of in the universe, conforms to
that pattern or that it's even

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:27.377 align:middle line:90%
a 50-50--

00:31:27.377 --> 00:31:29.460 align:middle line:84%
so I wouldn't I wouldn't
have any numbers on that,

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.610 align:middle line:84%
but we see it a
lot because those

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:33.860 align:middle line:84%
are species that we interact
with, that we trade with.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:38.510 align:middle line:84%
But there's absolutely some
really wide differences

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:39.592 align:middle line:90%
to that as well.

00:31:39.592 --> 00:31:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Randy, are
you currently working

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:44.120 align:middle line:84%
with any extraterrestrials
personally right

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.148 align:middle line:90%
now at this time?

00:31:46.148 --> 00:31:47.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: A couple, yeah.

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:48.023 align:middle line:90%
A couple of species.

00:31:48.023 --> 00:31:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: In what regards?

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: There
is a species that

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:54.980 align:middle line:84%
works very closely with the
United States Marine Corps

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.210 align:middle line:90%
Special Section.

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:59.480 align:middle line:84%
They have not had
a spoken language

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.390 align:middle line:90%
for a very, very long time.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So we have to translate
how we understand

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:10.620 align:middle line:90%
them to be into human language.

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.680 align:middle line:84%
So we tend to
refer to them based

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.070 align:middle line:84%
on what they've told us
as the Children of Light

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:19.580 align:middle line:84%
as they're called, which is get
a rough translation from what

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:20.510 align:middle line:90%
they understand.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:23.960 align:middle line:84%
They are actually evolved
from a reptoid species,

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.650 align:middle line:84%
but they're so far advanced
that you would look at them

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:30.380 align:middle line:90%
and not see the reptoid in them.

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:34.460 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be fairly small,
large, kind of a boxy head,

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:39.260 align:middle line:84%
big eyes, super
intelligent, lifespans

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.480 align:middle line:90%
that in the millions of years.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they're pretty unique
and pretty impressive.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.535 align:middle line:84%
And a couple, again, of species
who are living subterranean.

00:32:47.535 --> 00:32:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You probably heard
in the news every day almost,

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:53.420 align:middle line:84%
practically, there's
something about UFOs,

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:56.520 align:middle line:84%
or unidentified
aerial phenomena.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.180 align:middle line:90%
That's the new term.

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Who are they and
what is going on?

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.990 align:middle line:84%
It's obvious they're
showing themselves.

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.860 align:middle line:90%
We're seeing this.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.300 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of this is reverse
engineered stuff we have

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.870 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of it's not.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:09.930 align:middle line:90%
A lot lot.

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Right.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.862 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do
you know about that?

00:33:11.862 --> 00:33:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, certainly
as far as talking

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:15.500 align:middle line:84%
about what's happening
in the media,

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:19.087 align:middle line:84%
in the news right now, the
Navy more than any other agency

00:33:19.087 --> 00:33:21.170 align:middle line:84%
has been pushing this for
the last couple of years

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:22.400 align:middle line:90%
to get us closer and closer.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.700 align:middle line:84%
So they've changed their
reporting standards.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.760 align:middle line:84%
They went from a stance of
saying, if you see something,

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.430 align:middle line:84%
don't tell us or you
could lose your flying,

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.980 align:middle line:84%
to now saying, if you're
a pilot and you've ever

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.360 align:middle line:84%
seen or experienced
in something,

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.040 align:middle line:84%
we've changed the
reporting protocols.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.915 align:middle line:84%
We would like you to
make a report so that we

00:33:38.915 --> 00:33:40.670 align:middle line:84%
can start correlating
information that we

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:42.620 align:middle line:90%
want to release to the public.

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.800 align:middle line:84%
They've got an ex-assistant
intelligence director

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.780 align:middle line:84%
who's working with
these Navy pilots who

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.280 align:middle line:90%
are telling their stories.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:54.260 align:middle line:84%
They're doing it on cable
and other TV programs that

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.240 align:middle line:90%
are doing documentaries on it.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:01.040 align:middle line:84%
They're regularly appearing on
news programs and news shows

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.180 align:middle line:90%
talking about it.

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:08.719 align:middle line:84%
And the media is treating this
as if it's just a different day

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:09.980 align:middle line:90%
than it was 10 years ago.

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:13.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean 10 years ago,
you'd have people

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:17.000 align:middle line:84%
in the media being way more
skeptical way more scoffy.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.940 align:middle line:84%
But they're clearly reading
from bullet points that's

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.659 align:middle line:84%
way more supportive
and way more accepting,

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:28.219 align:middle line:84%
while just giving people that
room for plausible deniability

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:31.540 align:middle line:84%
so they don't have to freak out
if it touches a nerve for them.

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.040 align:middle line:84%
So they can still be like, well,
I don't want to believe it.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.139 align:middle line:84%
But there is definitely
a concerted effort

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:39.170 align:middle line:84%
to get closer and closer to
a place where we're admitting

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and acknowledging the
information that we have,

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.699 align:middle line:84%
which, again, is stepping
stones towards getting this

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:45.949 align:middle line:90%
to a disclosure moment.

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:48.020 align:middle line:84%
As far as what
species we're talking

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.639 align:middle line:84%
about that have been
visiting here, I mean,

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:54.020 align:middle line:84%
goodness gracious, I mean
we're talking about hundreds

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:58.010 align:middle line:84%
of species over just the
last few decades that

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:00.740 align:middle line:84%
have been here, been
visiting here, some of them

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.170 align:middle line:84%
with permission, some of
them without permission.

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: We also both realize
that that footage, which

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.140 align:middle line:84%
a lot of it comes
from the military,

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.600 align:middle line:84%
if they really did not want
that released it would not

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.500 align:middle line:90%
have been released.

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible,
Randy, that they're

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:18.885 align:middle line:84%
doing maybe a slow release to
ramp us up to get us ready?

00:35:18.885 --> 00:35:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.530 align:middle line:10%
In fact, what I found
interesting watching

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:22.905 align:middle line:10%
one of the programs
talking about

00:35:22.905 --> 00:35:26.900 align:middle line:10%
this Nimitz event was one
of the radar operators

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.710 align:middle line:10%
who'd been on the ship who was
talking about the camera images

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:32.210 align:middle line:10%
that they were releasing.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:35.238 align:middle line:10%
He said that he had seen
a higher resolution image

00:35:35.238 --> 00:35:36.530 align:middle line:10%
than the one they're releasing.

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:38.238 align:middle line:10%
So they've released
an image that they've

00:35:38.238 --> 00:35:40.400 align:middle line:10%
blurred a little
bit deliberately

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.050 align:middle line:10%
when the actual
image that they have

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:43.850 align:middle line:10%
is way more high definition.

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So that shows some effort to,
yeah, we want to show you this.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.510 align:middle line:84%
But we just want to
make it fuzzy enough

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:52.010 align:middle line:90%
to not be too shocking.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:54.770 align:middle line:84%
So, again, I think that's all
part of the concerted effort

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:58.160 align:middle line:84%
to get us softened up so that
we're ready when whatever

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.780 align:middle line:90%
happens happens.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Where do you see
the evolution of humans

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:04.940 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrials
finally just

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.760 align:middle line:84%
coming out in broad daylight,
and working together,

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.760 align:middle line:84%
and this not be such
a big secret anymore?

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Well, without going
into some lengthy discussion

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:16.100 align:middle line:84%
about the stepping stones
that we've gone through

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.350 align:middle line:84%
over the past seven
decades, I will

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:20.870 align:middle line:84%
sum up and say that
we have been going

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.330 align:middle line:84%
through a process over decades
that we're getting closer,

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:25.460 align:middle line:84%
and closer, and closer
to what I would refer to

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.560 align:middle line:84%
as an inevitable
disclosure moment,

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:30.320 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
something no matter what

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.170 align:middle line:84%
we do that we're going to be
able to keep secret forever.

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:35.390 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
gray area as far as

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:37.610 align:middle line:84%
how much longer that
will be a secret

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:41.330 align:middle line:84%
or how soon that
will be exposed.

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Now my understanding
of that process

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:46.010 align:middle line:84%
is those conversations
are going on.

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:49.160 align:middle line:84%
No times or dates
have been set yet,

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:53.630 align:middle line:84%
but we are talking about
what should be soon.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Now when I say soon,
let me put it this way,

00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:02.120 align:middle line:84%
I would be shocked and surprised
if we get to 2023, 2024

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.580 align:middle line:84%
and we're still having this
conversation without being

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.425 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by
extraterrestrial neighbors.

00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Yeah, I
agree with that.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, Randy, thank you so
much for coming on the show.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.080 align:middle line:90%
It's great having you.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.160 align:middle line:90%
Always is.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CRAMER: Thank
you for having me.

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:15.260 align:middle line:90%
It's been great to be here.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.810 align:middle line:84%

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:19.190 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
