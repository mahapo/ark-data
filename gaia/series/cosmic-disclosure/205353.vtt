00:00:18.857 --> 00:00:20.690 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Today
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.270 align:middle line:10%
we're with Richard Doty,
a retired special agent

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.010 align:middle line:10%
who served in the
Air Force Office

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.460 align:middle line:10%
of Special Investigations.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Richard was intimately
involved with UFO,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.590 align:middle line:90%
ET-related intelligence.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to speak
about the real Men in Black.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.300 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the show.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOTY:
Thank you, Emery.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, we all have
heard stories about the MIB

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.840 align:middle line:90%
and especially in Hollywood.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.670 align:middle line:90%
So is there any truth to that?

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The MIB,
or Men in Black,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:84%
is probably one of the
most controversial subjects

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.420 align:middle line:90%
within the UFO community.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.790 align:middle line:84%
There's so many stories
about the Men in Black

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.170 align:middle line:90%
and what they did.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And these stories go back to
the 1950s and even earlier

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.040 align:middle line:84%
1949 was supposedly an
incident where Men in Black

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.800 align:middle line:84%
visited a rancher
who had claimed to

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.420 align:middle line:84%
had seen something
in the desert.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.670 align:middle line:84%
But over the years,
these stories

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.670 align:middle line:84%
have somewhat been distorted,
but there is truth to it.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Well, who are
the real Men in Black?

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do they have a Men in
Black badge when they come up?

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: The real Men in Black--

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.870 align:middle line:84%
they work for the Air
Force Special Operations

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:90%
group out of Fort Belvoir.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And they are the
real Men in Black.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.500 align:middle line:84%
These are special intelligence
officers, specially trained.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's a special
unit within the Air Force

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.820 align:middle line:90%
intelligence service.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:90%
It's called Section K.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And these men and
women are sheep dipped.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And sheep dipped means
that they are military.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.270 align:middle line:84%
They discharge them
from the military.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.740 align:middle line:90%
They make them civilians.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And they bring them right
back into their same job.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.260 align:middle line:84%
The reason they do
this is because they

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.650 align:middle line:84%
don't have to follow
military protocols, the dress

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.360 align:middle line:90%
and grooming standards.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.995 align:middle line:84%
And they can operate more freely
outside the military channels.

00:02:11.995 --> 00:02:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Tell us a little
about their history

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.550 align:middle line:90%
and how they first appeared.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Back in the 1950s,
when the Project Blue Book

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.320 align:middle line:84%
was occurring, there was
investigations going on,

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.060 align:middle line:84%
both overtly and covertly
within the intelligence service.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Most of the overt
investigations were

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.630 align:middle line:84%
done by Air Force intelligence
officers, one of them

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:90%
being my uncle, Edward Doty.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And they would go out
and ask questions,

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:84%
collecting overt information
about UFO sightings.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a secretive
part of the Air Force

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.933 align:middle line:90%
intelligence service.

00:02:48.933 --> 00:02:50.350 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force
intelligence service

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.090 align:middle line:90%
had field operating units.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.010 align:middle line:90%
And they started in the '50s.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And they're even more
prevalent, even today.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was
their main agenda?

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And who did they
actually work for?

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Or was it multiple
three-letter agencies?

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Their mission
was to go out and collect

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.440 align:middle line:84%
the secret stuff, the secret
information about UFO sightings

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:90%
or a UFO incident that occurred.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.200 align:middle line:84%
They'd collect
photographs, or debris,

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.850 align:middle line:84%
or get statements from
people, examine the area

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.790 align:middle line:84%
where a UFO was
sighted or landed,

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.740 align:middle line:84%
collecting evidence
that's on the ground.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.530 align:middle line:90%
And this was all covertly.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.180 align:middle line:84%
So in order to covertly collect,
they had to have disguises.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And these guys were
experts in disguises.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were acting as
plumbers, air conditioning

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.880 align:middle line:84%
repair people, telephone repair
people, outside a normal chain.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.460 align:middle line:84%
They could easily
talk to people.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.350 align:middle line:84%
For instance, one
incident that happened

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.550 align:middle line:90%
in Watertown, New York--

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.600 align:middle line:84%
these MIBs came out
as electricians,

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.640 align:middle line:84%
because of an
incident that happened

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.670 align:middle line:84%
west of the community
of Watertown, New York,

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.820 align:middle line:90%
in upstate New York.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.290 align:middle line:90%
And this was in the '60s.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.240 align:middle line:84%
The Project Blue
Book investigators

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.970 align:middle line:84%
had already been there
and collected information.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.000 align:middle line:84%
But the two people that
actually saw this UFO and took

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.480 align:middle line:84%
pictures-- they wouldn't share
anything with the Air Force

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:90%
investigators.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So the Air Force
sent in these two

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.690 align:middle line:84%
men who were posing
as electricians,

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.670 align:middle line:90%
but they were the Men in Black.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And although they
weren't dressed in black,

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:84%
they were acting as this
covert operating team.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to
talk to these people

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.730 align:middle line:84%
in a normal, everyday
contact and asked them, hey,

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.070 align:middle line:90%
did you see something last week?

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Was there some kind
of a UFO incident?

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, these people
opened up to these two.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And they obtained
the photographs

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.752 align:middle line:90%
that the Air Force wanted.

00:04:47.752 --> 00:04:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: At what
point in a mission

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.770 align:middle line:90%
do they actually show up?

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: They come later.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:84%
They come after the initial
investigative team arrives.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.620 align:middle line:84%
either Project Blue Book
investigators or after that,

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.290 align:middle line:84%
the investigators
that arrived on scene

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:84%
to collect the evidence
or interview the witnesses

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:90%
to this.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And then depending
on what information

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.510 align:middle line:84%
that the initial
investigative team obtains,

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.690 align:middle line:90%
then the MIBs come in.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, the story is that
the MIBs are always there

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.580 align:middle line:84%
at every scene or
every incident.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.080 align:middle line:90%
And that's not true.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.950 align:middle line:84%
These guys come in on
legitimate sightings.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.680 align:middle line:84%
They come in and get
the real important stuff

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.170 align:middle line:84%
that the initial
investigative team didn't get.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So what are missions
tasked for, other than that?

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Are they debriefed
before, of course,

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.850 align:middle line:84%
they go out to these
investigations?

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:84%
They somehow know
of the incident.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's sometimes
questionable how they know.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And then they have
a specific mission

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.050 align:middle line:90%
of what they need to collect.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.070 align:middle line:84%
If they can't get the
information overtly,

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.450 align:middle line:90%
they'll get it covertly.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, if they
want the information,

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.230 align:middle line:90%
they're going to get it.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:84%
By hook or by crook, they're
going to get the information.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And they'll use any
means necessary,

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.510 align:middle line:84%
including surreptitious
entries into the residence

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:16.750 align:middle line:84%
to steal those photographs or
the information that's needed.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Could you offer us some
examples by any means of entry?

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, one of
the classical entry

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.680 align:middle line:90%
is a surreptitious entry.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.980 align:middle line:84%
They'll place the witness's
house under surveillance.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.630 align:middle line:90%
They'll watch them leave.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And then they enter
the residence.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll find what
they need, such as photographs

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.820 align:middle line:90%
or any other evidence.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And one example that happened
in Mississippi some years

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:84%
ago in the early '70s
is these two people

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.500 align:middle line:90%
observed a UFO had landed.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And a gift was given
to these people.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, the press
didn't run with this,

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.540 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't believe
the two, the man and woman.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.890 align:middle line:84%
But the Air Force knew
that it really did happen.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.190 align:middle line:84%
The initial investigator
went out, found evidence.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, this object or gift that
was given to these two people

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.660 align:middle line:90%
by the extraterrestrials--

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.760 align:middle line:90%
the government wanted.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.760 align:middle line:84%
So they sent in
the Men in Black.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And nothing would really
convince these two people

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:22.950 align:middle line:90%
to give up this.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So they had to use
intimidation, threats.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And they eventually got the
gift that the ET left for them.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's probably not the
norm of what they would do.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.750 align:middle line:84%
But the Air Force or the
government needed it so bad.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And they were worried
that this object that

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:84%
was given to these
people might have

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.830 align:middle line:84%
been some sort of a weapon or
something that might endanger

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.090 align:middle line:90%
them or the community.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.490 align:middle line:90%
So that's why they needed it.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Would they go as
far as to terminate a life

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.090 align:middle line:90%
to get what they need?

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Threats of harm--

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.490 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.520 align:middle line:84%
But terminating a
life-- no, I never

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.070 align:middle line:90%
heard or seen that happen.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, what are your
steps in the investigation

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.180 align:middle line:90%
process?

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The first thing
we do is interview, just

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.210 align:middle line:84%
a casual interview to find
out what the witness knew

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:90%
and what they did.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And then we sometimes either
move right to interrogation

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.395 align:middle line:84%
or come back later and
interrogate the people.

00:08:19.395 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's different
forms of interrogation.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.250 align:middle line:90%
There's hostile interrogation.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.260 align:middle line:84%
There's subtle interrogations,
different types.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And if none of
those things worked,

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.590 align:middle line:90%
then we would intimidate.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.330 align:middle line:90%
And we had ways of intimidation.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Again, there were steps in
the intimidation process.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And if that didn't work, then
we'd go to the covert process.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And the covert process
is what is unwitting.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're not
knowing what we're doing

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.190 align:middle line:90%
to obtain the information.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Can you describe
how a mission is determined

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.790 align:middle line:90%
for you guys to be deployed?

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, if a
UFO incident happened,

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.250 align:middle line:84%
somebody witnessed
the UFO land, or had

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.720 align:middle line:84%
some kind of close contact,
or obtained something

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.760 align:middle line:90%
from an alien.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, that could be something
that the saucer shaped

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.660 align:middle line:84%
or the ET craft
left at the scene

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:84%
without them knowing
it, maybe, or something

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
that was given as a gift,
or pictures that were taken.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:21.210 align:middle line:84%
At that point, if this
is reported to us,

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.570 align:middle line:90%
we would form a plan.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:23.370 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.042 align:middle line:90%
We'd have an investigative plan.

00:09:25.042 --> 00:09:26.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, here's what
we're going to do--

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.820 align:middle line:90%
this, this, this, and this.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes we
would do this as we're

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.620 align:middle line:90%
driving out to the scene.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes these
things were fluid.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And we couldn't take time to
sit back and draw it all up

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.215 align:middle line:90%
in a day or two or three days.

00:09:41.215 --> 00:09:43.590 align:middle line:84%
But while we're doing it, we
would have to get permission

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.900 align:middle line:90%
from our supervisor to act.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:46.733 align:middle line:90%
OK, we're going to--

00:09:46.733 --> 00:09:47.533 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:47.533 --> 00:09:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's the first
step-- interview.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And probably more
than 50% of the time,

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.250 align:middle line:84%
we would get everything we
wanted during the interview.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.425 align:middle line:84%
If they had photographs,
we would say, hey,

00:10:00.425 --> 00:10:02.400 align:middle line:84%
can we at least look
at the photographs?

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.110 align:middle line:84%
They might not give
us the photographs,

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.090 align:middle line:84%
but we want to see
the photographs,

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:10.260 align:middle line:84%
want to see what they took
Or if they had an artifact

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.290 align:middle line:84%
or something that was left
at the scene, we'd say,

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.360 align:middle line:90%
can you show it to us?

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle line:90%
And normally, they would.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they wouldn't, if
the interview ended and they

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't give us
any information,

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.840 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't cooperate
with us, then we

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.300 align:middle line:84%
would have to go
back and draft up

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:84%
an operational plan,
not investigative plan,

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.748 align:middle line:90%
but an operational plan.

00:10:30.748 --> 00:10:32.040 align:middle line:90%
Because we're going to operate.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.790 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
out and do something.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And then we would submit
it to our supervisor.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes that would have
to go up to headquarters.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And they would have to give
us permission to do it.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, 9 times out of
10, they would give us

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.080 align:middle line:90%
the permission to do it.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:84%
There's always that
case where they

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:51.990 align:middle line:84%
said-- where they would come
back and say it's not worth it.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Don't go any farther.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.600 align:middle line:90%
And then we would terminate it.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And what jurisdiction
does that fall under if they--

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.340 align:middle line:84%
let's say an extraterrestrial
vehicle crashed on my property,

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:08.610 align:middle line:84%
and the extraterrestrial came
out and gave me some artifact,

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.820 align:middle line:90%
and I took it inside?

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.110 align:middle line:90%
That's my property.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.700 align:middle line:90%
This is one of my buddies.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.080 align:middle line:90%
He gave me a gift.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: OK.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.320 align:middle line:90%
What we would do then--

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.220 align:middle line:84%
the military has the right
under a different title.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.520 align:middle line:84%
There's United States Title 10,
Title 50 of the United States

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Code, which we would make
your area a national defense

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:35.130 align:middle line:84%
zone, meaning everything
within that zone

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.600 align:middle line:90%
is under military jurisdiction.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.060 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like martial law.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.830 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
declaring martial law

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.090 align:middle line:90%
for that particular area.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, now, the
military could come in

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.160 align:middle line:84%
and take what we want to
take or investigate what we

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.275 align:middle line:90%
want to take on your property.

00:11:49.275 --> 00:11:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, could
you give us an example

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.320 align:middle line:84%
of when that happened or
an example that you were

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.880 align:middle line:90%
associated with, with this?

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:02.400 align:middle line:84%
In the latter part
of 1982, an incident

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.230 align:middle line:90%
happened in western New Mexico.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:09.650 align:middle line:90%
Something fell off a craft.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, the local police,
the sheriff's department

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.610 align:middle line:84%
in the area notified
the military

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.460 align:middle line:84%
that something fell off
one of our aircrafts.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was in this
person's property.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:27.090 align:middle line:90%
And it was a rather large item.

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And so the local National
Guard unit went out there.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was some distance
away from the National Guard.

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.700 align:middle line:90%
So they sent a team out there.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.890 align:middle line:84%
They just went out there
to see what it was.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:42.110 align:middle line:84%
When they went out there,
and they looked at it,

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and they said, this doesn't
look like it fell off

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:48.620 align:middle line:84%
any kind of-- it was a pod,
some sort of a round pod

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't look like it fell
off anything that we know of.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:52.400 align:middle line:90%
And they couldn't identify it.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.730 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't any writing on it.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.970 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any
nomenclature on it.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So they notified
Kirtland and said, hey,

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:02.210 align:middle line:84%
are you guys experimenting
with something out here?

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the meantime,
another aircraft,

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.790 align:middle line:84%
an SR-71 that was flying,
took pictures of something

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.190 align:middle line:90%
that was unconventional.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.380 align:middle line:90%
And so they had reported this.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, it got to us,
and we went out there.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.900 align:middle line:90%
And the people that--

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.850 align:middle line:84%
they had it in
their living room.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.950 align:middle line:84%
They had on their couch
in their living room.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.720 align:middle line:84%
All we were told is that
there's an object that fell off

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.660 align:middle line:84%
and we need to go
to retrieve it.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.040 align:middle line:90%
So we went out there.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And the people were
totally uncooperative.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:38.486 align:middle line:84%
We went out there, identified
ourselves as federal agents--

00:13:38.486 --> 00:13:39.465 align:middle line:90%
AFOSI.

00:13:39.465 --> 00:13:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And something fell off
a government aircraft

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.000 align:middle line:90%
and you have it.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:90%
And they said, well, so?

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.580 align:middle line:90%
It's ours now.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.600 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, no, it's not yours.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.893 align:middle line:84%
It belongs to the United
States government.

00:13:50.893 --> 00:13:52.060 align:middle line:90%
And they wouldn't cooperate.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Uh-oh.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: So we went to the--

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.410 align:middle line:84%
there's a procedure that we
would have to go through.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:00.170 align:middle line:84%
We'd have to notify the
wing commander at a base.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And we'd have to
notify a federal judge

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.330 align:middle line:84%
that we're requesting a
national defense zone.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:06.447 align:middle line:90%
And it was granted.

00:14:06.447 --> 00:14:07.280 align:middle line:90%
It didn't take much.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And how
long does that take?

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.915 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think
it took two hours.

00:14:09.915 --> 00:14:11.540 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember the
exact time period.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.920 align:middle line:84%
But, funny, it was
once we presented them

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.890 align:middle line:84%
with the documents declaring
a national defense zone,

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:90%
they were cooperative.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So we weren't sure how
to transport this thing.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.560 align:middle line:90%
It was somewhat heavy.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.000 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't know what it was.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.790 align:middle line:84%
It was a round
shaped ball that had

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:90%
designed grooves all over it.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.810 align:middle line:90%
And it had sections.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.680 align:middle line:84%
You could see
sections in this ball.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was as if this ball
opened up in some manner.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.390 align:middle line:84%
There was a small
piece of metal on top

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.850 align:middle line:84%
as if it was hanging,
maybe from a craft,

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:90%
or aircraft, or something.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.810 align:middle line:90%
We had a crime kit.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.250 align:middle line:10%
And we had magnifying glass.

00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:59.750 align:middle line:10%
And we were looking
for nomenclature

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:00.970 align:middle line:10%
and maybe small writing.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.120 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing on there.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.830 align:middle line:84%
So we got one of the EOD guy,
the Explosive Ordnance Disposal

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:11.450 align:middle line:84%
guy from the National
Guard at the unit in Gallup

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.586 align:middle line:90%
to come and look at it.

00:15:13.586 --> 00:15:14.590 align:middle line:90%
Was it a bomb?

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:15.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this was some
kind of a nuclear bomb,

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.600 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it was a
conventional bomb.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.780 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know what it was.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.490 align:middle line:90%
He said, I don't know.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:23.650 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen it before.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not in my manuals.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.680 align:middle line:90%
I can't say what it is.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.580 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, he brought a
container that we placed it in.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And he actually transported
it in his vehicle to Kirtland.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Once we got to
Kirtland, we turned it

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:41.120 align:middle line:84%
over to Sandia National
Laboratories to analyze.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And then from there,
it went to Los Alamos.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And we kept bugging
at Los Alamos.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.810 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Finally, after several
weeks, the colonel

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:56.760 align:middle line:84%
got on the KY, the secure
line to me and said,

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.618 align:middle line:90%
it's not conventional.

00:15:58.618 --> 00:15:59.660 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, what is it?

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.640 align:middle line:90%
He says it's extraterrestrial.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.430 align:middle line:84%
I said, do they know for sure
that it's-- he said, yeah.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:09.180 align:middle line:84%
He said, so you got to classify
it in a certain manner.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.380 align:middle line:90%
And I never saw it again.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.963 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
it went from there.

00:16:11.963 --> 00:16:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, there's a lot
of images online that claim

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:19.460 align:middle line:84%
to have caught the
MIB in the background.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.600 align:middle line:84%
What could you
tell us about that?

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, they
wore disguises.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And some of their
missions might involve

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:36.385 align:middle line:84%
intimidating by posing as
maybe extraterrestrials.

00:16:36.385 --> 00:16:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: So
purposely doing this?

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Purposely.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Purposely.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So I personally never
experienced that.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:84%
But I had other agents
tell me that they did work

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.340 align:middle line:84%
with them where
they would dress,

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:54.590 align:middle line:84%
use disguises, fake
eye socket, things

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:58.670 align:middle line:84%
that would make them look like
they might be extraterrestrials

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.430 align:middle line:90%
or non-humans.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, what's the Men
in Black's working relationship

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.170 align:middle line:90%
with the government?

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:09.799 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, they operated
within their own circle,

00:17:09.799 --> 00:17:10.599 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:12.910 align:middle line:90%
They had a mission.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And some of these Men in Black
not only worked in a UFO arena.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:22.579 align:middle line:84%
They worked in intelligence,
espionage operations having

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:25.220 align:middle line:90%
nothing to do with the UFOs.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And some of them had
submissions that were probably

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.700 align:middle line:84%
the most dangerous missions that
you could send an intelligence

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.960 align:middle line:90%
officer on.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So they had to be highly
trained and very well motivated.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So they did things other
than the UFO related.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And the history of
the Men in Black

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.750 align:middle line:84%
only shows the
UFO-related incidents.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:84%
But they did wear disguises,
drive strange-looking vehicles,

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:90%
and wore strange suits.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one particular instance
I can remember happening

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.970 align:middle line:90%
was they were the Men in Black.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.540 align:middle line:84%
The two intelligence officers
were posing Men in Black

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:84%
from Kirtland Air Force
Base, was going out

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.420 align:middle line:84%
to a person who was
really reluctant to talk

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.290 align:middle line:90%
about the subject.

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So they went out there
posing as extraterrestrials.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And their suits--
their black suits

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:30.495 align:middle line:84%
actually had some strange
lighting built into the suits.

00:18:30.495 --> 00:18:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't actually see the
suits, but I heard about it.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And they would
click this thing on.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And it made them light up so
much that it scared the dickens

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:90%
out of these witnesses.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's just one
example I know about them

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.990 align:middle line:90%
using a disguise to intimidate.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Wow.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, were there any
Men in Black programs

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:53.860 align:middle line:84%
that actually used non-human
species, part of the project?

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Well, you hear about it.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:19:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
legends going back

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.630 align:middle line:90%
in certain incidents.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.600 align:middle line:84%
I personally did
not know of any,

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.770 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't fully
briefed into everything.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.620 align:middle line:84%
There could possibly
be some kind

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.370 align:middle line:84%
of working relationships between
the extraterrestrials that

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.760 align:middle line:84%
are visiting Earth, that are
here and the Men in Black.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.687 align:middle line:84%
But I personally
don't know of any.

00:19:20.687 --> 00:19:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: But you're
saying, in your opinion,

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.320 align:middle line:90%
it's a possibility.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes, it's a possibility.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.600 align:middle line:84%
I've heard of it happening from
other intelligence officers.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.265 align:middle line:84%
But me, I've never
seen it, personally.

00:19:30.265 --> 00:19:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What do you
mean you heard about it?

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, I had intelligence
officers I worked with,

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.310 align:middle line:84%
especially two of them
that worked out of Area 51

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:40.480 align:middle line:84%
with me, who had
different accesses than I

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.540 align:middle line:90%
had to different operations.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And they told me once
that they'd worked

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:50.150 align:middle line:90%
with these two Section K guys.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And within the government, we
don't call them Men in Black.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:84%
We call them Section Ks
and the Section K guys.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And they worked with some
of the people that we-- some

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:middle line:90%
of the ETs that we had here.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's really,
basically, all I was told.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, do you have direct
contact or direct involvement

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:13.950 align:middle line:90%
with the Men in Black?

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I don't
nowadays, but I did.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:20.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had an incident happen
at Kirtland Air Force Base

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.150 align:middle line:84%
where I was-- the
very first experience

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:90%
I had with the Men in Black.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And that involved
two pilots flying

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:33.780 align:middle line:84%
A-7D fighter jets for the
150th Air National Guard.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.390 align:middle line:84%
They were flying a training
mission from Kirtland Air Force

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Base, down to White Sands,
a classified landing

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.850 align:middle line:90%
area around White Sands.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.370 align:middle line:84%
While they were coming
in for a landing,

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:49.200 align:middle line:84%
the White Sands air traffic
control operator told them,

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.890 align:middle line:84%
you've got a bogey flying
around your aircrafts.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:55.140 align:middle line:90%
You guys need to be careful.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And the pilot saw this
object flying around.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.010 align:middle line:90%
It was a cigar-shaped object.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:05.890 align:middle line:84%
It was probably 40
to 50 feet long.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.680 align:middle line:90%
It was thick in diameter.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.410 align:middle line:90%
And it was spinning like a top.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And the pilots didn't know
what it was, about 10,000 feet.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.640 align:middle line:84%
So the pilots asked
air traffic controller.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.470 align:middle line:90%
We need to land.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.053 align:middle line:84%
And we need to go
to a lower altitude,

00:21:20.053 --> 00:21:23.240 align:middle line:84%
and land, and get away
from this object up here.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:27.060 align:middle line:84%
So as they were traveling
to a lower altitude,

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.250 align:middle line:90%
this craft moved with them.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, the craft
collided with those two A-7Ds.

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:40.640 align:middle line:84%
The air traffic controller
saw the A-7D aircraft.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And A-7D aircrafts
are just jet fighters.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.020 align:middle line:90%
They were only jet fighters.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And the UFO all disappeared,
only to reappear

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.870 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the runway.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Both A-7Ds were on the ground.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.570 align:middle line:90%
And this UFO was on the ground.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:05.310 align:middle line:84%
So the air traffic control
sent a follow-me vehicle.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:06.780 align:middle line:90%
And this is a type of vehicle.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.940 align:middle line:84%
It's called a aircraft
assist vehicle.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:13.050 align:middle line:84%
In the layman's term, would
go out and lead the aircrafts

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:14.760 align:middle line:90%
to a parking area.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.210 align:middle line:84%
This aircraft assist
vehicle went out there,

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.380 align:middle line:90%
found the two pilots.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.180 align:middle line:84%
They were outside
their aircraft,

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.550 align:middle line:84%
stunned, didn't know
what really happened.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:30.830 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, this UFO had
taken off and was flying away.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:34.490 align:middle line:84%
The pilot was just taking the
base operations, interviewed,

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:36.890 align:middle line:90%
checked by a medical officer.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:41.150 align:middle line:84%
They had a strange story
about experiencing something

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.490 align:middle line:84%
that they really
couldn't explain,

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:47.750 align:middle line:84%
that they saw these
tall-looking humanoids.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:51.780 align:middle line:84%
They were very, very tall,
maybe 7 to 8 feet tall.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.690 align:middle line:90%
They were very thin.

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:57.620 align:middle line:90%
And they had bronze helmets on.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.930 align:middle line:90%
And they had very long arms.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And although these
extraterrestrials

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:06.037 align:middle line:84%
were talking to
them in a language,

00:23:06.037 --> 00:23:07.620 align:middle line:84%
they could hear the
language, but they

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.240 align:middle line:90%
couldn't understand it.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.980 align:middle line:84%
They were
understanding what they

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:14.750 align:middle line:84%
were saying in their
head, such as telepathy.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:18.272 align:middle line:84%
And then they found
themselves on the ground.

00:23:18.272 --> 00:23:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: What was the message
that they were leaving?

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: The message
was Earth has

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:29.630 align:middle line:90%
to stop exploding atomic bombs.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:33.050 align:middle line:90%
You are damaging the universe.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't stop, you're
going to find Earth burning.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And both pilots later
told me that they

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:43.660 align:middle line:90%
saw pictures of Earth burning.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, these two pilots
eventually were

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:48.800 align:middle line:84%
able to fly their
aircrafts without incident

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.600 align:middle line:90%
back to Kirtland.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:90%
I had been notified.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.602 align:middle line:84%
I met them at the Air National
Guard Operation Center.

00:23:54.602 --> 00:23:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I put them in my vehicle,
and I drove them back

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.795 align:middle line:90%
to the OSI office.

00:23:58.795 --> 00:24:00.170 align:middle line:84%
I took them in an
interview room.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:02.180 align:middle line:84%
I placed them in
separate interview rooms.

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I went in and initially
interviewed both of them,

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:90%
got their information.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:08.540 align:middle line:84%
They told me basically
what happened.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.330 align:middle line:84%
While I was in, my supervisor
came and knocked on the door

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.070 align:middle line:90%
and told me, come out.

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:17.360 align:middle line:84%
He said there's two Air Force
intelligence officers here

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.560 align:middle line:90%
from DET 22.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.700 align:middle line:84%
DET 22 was an Air Force
intelligence operations

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.010 align:middle line:84%
location on the
base, a detachment.

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:28.520 align:middle line:84%
I knew some of them, but
I didn't know all of them.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.520 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know these two.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.080 align:middle line:90%
I went out.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.455 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah,
can I help you?

00:24:31.455 --> 00:24:35.802 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we'd like to
take over this investigation.

00:24:35.802 --> 00:24:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
who are you guys?

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And they showed me Air
Force intelligence ID cards.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.610 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, this
is an OSI matter.

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:45.370 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, no, no,
it's our matter now.

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, these two men were
dressed in black suits.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.550 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
military uniforms on.

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.230 align:middle line:90%
So I checked with my supervisor.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:54.242 align:middle line:84%
And I said these guys
are trying to interfere

00:24:54.242 --> 00:24:55.200 align:middle line:90%
with our investigation.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.690 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I just
got a teletype in.

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's telling you to
turn it over to them.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:04.090 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I did what my
supervisor told me.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:06.790 align:middle line:90%
They went in.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:09.370 align:middle line:84%
About an hour later, the
two intelligence officers

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:10.630 align:middle line:90%
came out and left.

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:12.730 align:middle line:84%
I went in and talked
to the two officers.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, the two intelligence
officers came out to me

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:18.010 align:middle line:90%
and told me, they were wrong.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:22.960 align:middle line:84%
What they saw wasn't what
they're claiming to see.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.820 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do a report.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
keep their mouth shut.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:27.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they told me.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.480 align:middle line:90%
And they left.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, I went back in and talked
to them, and they were scared.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:35.500 align:middle line:84%
He said, we don't like
you two cohorts here.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, number
one, they don't work for OSI.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:39.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who they are.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:41.953 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know their
intelligence officers.

00:25:41.953 --> 00:25:43.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, they're
not even dressed right.

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:46.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
dressed in suits.

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:47.973 align:middle line:90%
They got long hair.

00:25:47.973 --> 00:25:49.140 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, you know what?

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.310 align:middle line:84%
They're US
intelligence officers.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.530 align:middle line:90%
They're not OSI agents.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:55.040 align:middle line:90%
I said, what did they tell you?

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.840 align:middle line:84%
They told us if we
reported what we saw,

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.353 align:middle line:90%
they were going to bust us.

00:26:00.353 --> 00:26:02.020 align:middle line:84%
They're going to send
us to Leavenworth.

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.920 align:middle line:90%
I said, what?

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.160 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, now, I'm interested.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.600 align:middle line:90%
I want to know what you saw.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And so they gave
me the whole story.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.640 align:middle line:84%
I get written statements from
them, plus I recorded it.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.560 align:middle line:90%
So they left.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.380 align:middle line:90%
I took them back to their car.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:90%
And they left and went home.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:22.840 align:middle line:84%
About two weeks later, they
came to my office, both of them.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And they said, our
off-base residences--

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.400 align:middle line:84%
and they lived together in
the same apartment complex--

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Sure.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:31.067 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --in
different apartments.

00:26:31.067 --> 00:26:32.990 align:middle line:90%
Our apartments were broken into.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.880 align:middle line:90%
I said, broken into?

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.870 align:middle line:90%
When?

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:36.940 align:middle line:84%
A couple days ago
or a day before.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.460 align:middle line:90%
I said, what was taken?

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:43.222 align:middle line:84%
He said, as far as I know,
just 35-millimeter canisters.

00:26:43.222 --> 00:26:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, did you report
it to Albuquerque Police

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:46.595 align:middle line:90%
Department?

00:26:46.595 --> 00:26:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but when the
patrolman got there,

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.178 align:middle line:84%
he told us we had to
report it to the military.

00:26:50.178 --> 00:26:51.970 align:middle line:84%
They weren't going
to take a report.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:52.770 align:middle line:90%
I said, what?

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:90%
That's off base.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.830 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, I'll
follow you over there.

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So I went over there
with another agent

00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:58.190 align:middle line:90%
to their residence.

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And I looked through, and
they showed me the door.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.110 align:middle line:90%
It was a sloppy break-in.

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:08.950 align:middle line:84%
A door was jimmied and
so forth, and so on.

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:13.947 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of them said, I have
a camera, an '81 Canon AE-1

00:27:13.947 --> 00:27:15.030 align:middle line:90%
camera up here on a shelf.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:90%
And I have film canisters.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:20.680 align:middle line:84%
I take pictures of
sceneries and so forth.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And the other one said
he had another camera

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.530 align:middle line:90%
with film cartridges.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:26.560 align:middle line:90%
And all of them are missing.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.868 align:middle line:90%
I said that's strange.

00:27:27.868 --> 00:27:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So I started checking
around the residence.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I
went to was their phones.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And I opened the phones
up, and they were bugged.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.120 align:middle line:84%
I didn't tell them
they were bugged.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.085 align:middle line:84%
Because I figured
it was a FISA--

00:27:39.085 --> 00:27:42.160 align:middle line:84%
a federal intelligence
surveillance warrant,

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and that somebody is
investigating them.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.250 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't tell them anything.

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:49.108 align:middle line:84%
I went back to the office,
and I checked with the FBI.

00:27:49.108 --> 00:27:50.650 align:middle line:84%
They were just down
the hall from us.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:53.220 align:middle line:84%
I went down and my contact
with the FBI and said, hey,

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.655 align:middle line:84%
you guys have a FISA warrant
on such and such addresses?

00:27:56.655 --> 00:27:57.540 align:middle line:90%
He checked.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.500 align:middle line:84%
No, didn't know
anything about it.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.300 align:middle line:90%
So, OK.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.020 align:middle line:90%
So I went back to the office.

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:05.230 align:middle line:84%
I sent a message up to
Air Force headquarters.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.433 align:middle line:84%
The next day, one of
them called and said,

00:28:07.433 --> 00:28:08.350 align:middle line:90%
no, we don't have any.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:09.150 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:11.030 align:middle line:90%
No FISA warrants on that.

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.770 align:middle line:90%
I thought, wow, that's strange.

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:13.670 align:middle line:90%
So the last place--

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I checked with the
domestic collections,

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:23.180 align:middle line:84%
intelligence collections,
which was the CIA and bingo.

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:23.990 align:middle line:90%
They had.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:25.698 align:middle line:84%
But it was a non-law
enforcement warrant.

00:28:25.698 --> 00:28:27.065 align:middle line:90%
It was for 60 days.

00:28:27.065 --> 00:28:28.640 align:middle line:84%
A non-law enforcement
warning is--

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.320 align:middle line:84%
it can't be--
anything they gather

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.890 align:middle line:90%
can't be used against anybody.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:33.890 align:middle line:84%
It's just for
intelligence purposes.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:36.200 align:middle line:90%
A law enforcement warrant--

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.020 align:middle line:84%
within 30 days, you have
to notify the target.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And the information can be used
against you in a court of law.

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, this isn't going
to be used against them.

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:49.860 align:middle line:84%
So I went back to the office,
maybe a week or two later.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.160 align:middle line:84%
These two intelligence
officers showed up in my office

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.562 align:middle line:84%
and said, you're interfering
with our investigation.

00:28:55.562 --> 00:28:57.312 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: You're getting
in trouble, right?

00:28:57.312 --> 00:28:58.645 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: So why am I interfering?

00:28:58.645 --> 00:29:00.600 align:middle line:84%
He said, you went
out and started

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.650 align:middle line:90%
checking on our warrants.

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.690 align:middle line:90%
And I said, so?

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:05.670 align:middle line:84%
I said, you think I
did something wrong?

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I'll take you down
to my supervisors.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:08.670 align:middle line:90%
He's a GM-14.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:10.300 align:middle line:90%
You talk to him.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And you know what
we're going to do?

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.508 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go down
to the FBI office,

00:29:13.508 --> 00:29:15.360 align:middle line:90%
just down the hallway here.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.932 align:middle line:90%
You can report it to them.

00:29:16.932 --> 00:29:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Oh, of course, they backed
off and said, oh, we don't

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:19.980 align:middle line:90%
want you to get in trouble.

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.420 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm not worried
about getting in trouble.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.295 align:middle line:84%
I'm worried about you
guys getting in trouble

00:29:23.295 --> 00:29:24.220 align:middle line:90%
for what you did.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:28.530 align:middle line:84%
You're going to either clue
me in on what you're doing,

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:31.110 align:middle line:84%
brief me into this
program or I'm

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:33.030 align:middle line:84%
going to go down
into the FBI office.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.600 align:middle line:84%
So then they said,
you got a Q room?

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.400 align:middle line:90%
I said yeah.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.720 align:middle line:84%
A Q room is a secure room that
you can talk about top secret

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.840 align:middle line:90%
or above in it.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.398 align:middle line:84%
So I took them downstairs
to our Q room, went in.

00:29:43.398 --> 00:29:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And they briefed me
into the program.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.860 align:middle line:90%
And they knew that these two--

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:52.110 align:middle line:84%
that this extraterrestrial
craft was hostile.

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:56.850 align:middle line:84%
They knew it, and that this
extraterrestrial race--

00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:01.200 align:middle line:84%
humanoids-- that had threatened
these two Air Force pilots

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.880 align:middle line:90%
were hostile.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.200 align:middle line:90%
And they're investigating it.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.850 align:middle line:90%
And they showed me authority.

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And I understood
what they were doing.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:17.100 align:middle line:84%
But they operated
within Section K.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And they operated
outside the norm.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.320 align:middle line:84%
They should have briefed me in a
long time ago, but they didn't.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And so that's my dealings
with Men in Black.

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you know what kind
of extraterrestrials they were

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.130 align:middle line:90%
and why they were hostile?

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: At that time
in 1982, I wasn't

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:38.445 align:middle line:84%
fully briefed into the different
races of extraterrestrials

00:30:38.445 --> 00:30:40.080 align:middle line:90%
that were visiting the Earth.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the intelligence
officers had a sketch.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.070 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a picture.

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:50.700 align:middle line:84%
But it was a sketch of this
ET and very long and slender,

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:54.150 align:middle line:90%
very long legs, very long arms.

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:55.980 align:middle line:90%
And they wore this helmet.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:59.835 align:middle line:84%
It appeared to be a helmet
with almost insect-like eyes

00:30:59.835 --> 00:31:00.960 align:middle line:90%
sticking out of the helmet.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not sure if
that was their head

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:05.460 align:middle line:90%
or if that was just a helmet.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.290 align:middle line:84%
But later on, when I
was fully briefed in,

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:12.270 align:middle line:84%
you connect that to
the pre-mantis type

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:16.870 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials that
created humanoids or robots.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: And in what way
were they showing hostilities

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.592 align:middle line:90%
to these pilots?

00:31:20.592 --> 00:31:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They were
threatening them.

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:25.380 align:middle line:84%
They're threatening
them personally.

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, there was a lot
of threats issued to them.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.090 align:middle line:90%
They were going to be cremated.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:31.230 align:middle line:90%
They were going to--

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:33.315 align:middle line:90%
their life span would end.

00:31:33.315 --> 00:31:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Or I think what one of
the pilots told me--

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.810 align:middle line:84%
it was explained to them
their life cycle would end,

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.730 align:middle line:90%
whatever it was meant.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:42.720 align:middle line:90%
They understood.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I think the
extraterrestrials understood

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:48.060 align:middle line:90%
us having life cycles.

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And these hostile ETs were
running rampant around Earth.

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:55.590 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any
control on them.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
considered them hostile.

00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Was there
a prior history

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.260 align:middle line:90%
of this race threatening?

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes.

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:04.440 align:middle line:84%
This one intelligence
officer told

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:09.090 align:middle line:84%
me there is a prior history
of this particular ET

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:17.250 align:middle line:84%
race of harming humans, damaging
property, military aircrafts.

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:19.300 align:middle line:84%
There's a historical
record of them.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
considered them hostile.

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Now, the big question
is, have you ever been

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.640 align:middle line:90%
in the role of a man in black?

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: On one occasion.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:32.905 align:middle line:84%
I was somewhat
loaned to Section K

00:32:32.905 --> 00:32:36.870 align:middle line:84%
to obtain an object from
an Air Force person.

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And I operated within their
guidelines, not OSI guidelines,

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.940 align:middle line:90%
to obtain that object.

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
successful operation.

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:50.190 align:middle line:84%
But the only time I
ever did it was then.

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Do you think they
chose you for that position

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.950 align:middle line:84%
because you are Air
Force intelligence?

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, one of the reason
they chose me-- because I

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.450 align:middle line:90%
had a linguist ability.

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:02.070 align:middle line:90%
I went to a language school.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:03.450 align:middle line:90%
I speak German.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:07.200 align:middle line:84%
They wanted me to approach this
person as a foreign national.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And German was a
foreign national.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.010 align:middle line:84%
The other agent
that was loaned--

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:15.060 align:middle line:84%
he was a Spanish-speaking
linguist.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the both of us
was approaching this.

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:22.840 align:middle line:84%
It's somewhat complicated
case, but as non-Americans.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I see.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:27.430 align:middle line:84%
What specifics can you share
with us on that mission?

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, the
initial approach

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:34.420 align:middle line:84%
to this Air Force person-- he
was a high-ranking officer.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:38.140 align:middle line:84%
We failed, because he
wouldn't cooperate with us.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.240 align:middle line:90%
He would speak with us.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:45.550 align:middle line:84%
He would relate
some stories to us.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:49.360 align:middle line:84%
But he wouldn't ever
address the direct mission

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.030 align:middle line:84%
that we were there
to discuss or want.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:55.300 align:middle line:84%
So we had to go to step
two, which was using some

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.100 align:middle line:84%
clandestine operations,
which I can't--

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
go into right now.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:02.380 align:middle line:84%
We were able to
incapacitate the Air Force

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:06.370 align:middle line:84%
person without harming
him in any way,

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:09.969 align:middle line:84%
obtaining the object that
the Air Force wanted,

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:13.659 align:middle line:84%
and then complete
the mission that way.

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:17.659 align:middle line:84%
It took several weeks in
order to get what they wanted.

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to
get the object, which

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:23.179 align:middle line:84%
ended up to be
extraterrestrial in nature.

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: Amazing.

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:30.810 align:middle line:84%
What does a modern MIB program
look like currently, today?

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:33.389 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, I'm certainly
out of the program.

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:36.239 align:middle line:84%
But I know of other
intelligence officers.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:38.820 align:middle line:90%
I maintain contact with some.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's still going
on today, but I think

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:43.500 align:middle line:90%
they have different missions.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:48.659 align:middle line:84%
As our technology has
advanced and our way of life

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:51.600 align:middle line:84%
has advanced, they had
to advance their tricks

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.378 align:middle line:90%
and their policies.

00:34:55.378 --> 00:34:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY: Rick, once again,
it's always a pleasure

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:58.950 align:middle line:90%
to have you on the show.

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:00.788 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: It's good to
be here on this show.

00:35:00.788 --> 00:35:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY: I'm Emery Smith.

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is "Cosmic
Disclosure," until next time.

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:08.300 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:17.000 align:middle line:90%
