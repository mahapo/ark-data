>>RICHARD C. DOTY:
We should be thankful

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.920 align:middle line:84%
that we had an extraterrestrial
that came to our planet,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.720 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think we
would be where we are today

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.920 align:middle line:90%
without J-Rod's assistance.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the things we wanted
to do was take his DNA,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.440 align:middle line:84%
analyze it, and compare it with
human DNA, and we did that.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.440 align:middle line:84%
We probably, at one
point in our evolution,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.273 align:middle line:90%
commingled with the Pleiadians.

00:00:36.273 --> 00:00:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH GOLEMBESKE: OK.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They are in more of
a subtropical, cooler climate

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.860 align:middle line:90%
than Earth would be.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.137 align:middle line:84%
So they have vegetation, trees,
rocks, soils, similar to Earth.

00:00:48.137 --> 00:00:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: It's just
nice to hear stories

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.900 align:middle line:90%
about how they've helped us.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:10%
What if an advanced
species from the Pleiades

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.870 align:middle line:10%
isn't just observing us, but
shares a direct genetic link

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:10%
to humanity?

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:10%
Today on Cosmic
Disclosure, we're

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.270 align:middle line:10%
joined by former Air Force
OSI agent Richard Doty

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.590 align:middle line:10%
to explore the Pleiadians,
their connection

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.110 align:middle line:10%
to our DNA, their way
of life, and what we've

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:10%
learned from direct contact.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm Josh Golembeske,
MUFON field investigator,

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.370 align:middle line:90%
and your guest host today.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Richard, welcome
back to the show.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Thank you, Josh.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.130 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be here.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: I'm happy to continue
this fascinating conversation.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.130 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we're going
to break down the Pleiadians.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.870 align:middle line:84%
A lot of information you've
learned from Ben and from J-Rod.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.490 align:middle line:90%
So let's dive right into this.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, the Pleiadians,
as we've said in a different

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.030 align:middle line:84%
episode, came to us in 1959
when it crashed and we had one

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.110 align:middle line:90%
in captivity--

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:84%
J-Rod, and we had
him at Area 51.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.070 align:middle line:84%
He assisted us in
the development

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.150 align:middle line:84%
of our advanced technology
as far as aircrafts.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And they gave us the technology
and they even assisted us

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.302 align:middle line:90%
in traveling to other worlds.

00:02:00.302 --> 00:02:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Thank you
for that summary.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So the first big question
I want to ask is about DNA.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.000 align:middle line:84%
What is the difference between
Pleiadian DNA and ours?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm just guessing there must
be some sort of similarities.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: In 1959, I
think in '60, '61,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.260 align:middle line:84%
as long as the
J-Rod was with us,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:84%
we knew he was
similar to humans.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.100 align:middle line:84%
He looked similar, bipedal,
they had arms and legs,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.600 align:middle line:84%
digits on their hands
and on their feet.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Although, their eye
sockets were different.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.180 align:middle line:90%
They had no eyebrows.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Their eyes were a little
bit different than ours.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And the X-rays of their
bodies, of course,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.540 align:middle line:84%
back then they didn't have a
CAT scan or MRI, was different.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But over the years, when we
started realizing what DNA was,

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.900 align:middle line:84%
one of the things we wanted
to do was take their DNA,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.300 align:middle line:84%
take his DNA, analyze it and
compare it with human DNA.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.520 align:middle line:90%
And we did that.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And we found that although
we have two strands,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.690 align:middle line:90%
they have three.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Their helix is similar to ours,
but they have a strand or part

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:84%
of their strand that
will prevent mutagens

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.930 align:middle line:90%
from occurring in their body.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.190 align:middle line:84%
What they found out in
the end was we probably,

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.470 align:middle line:84%
at one point in our evolution,
commingled with the Pleiadians.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: OK.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Now, they specifically
used the word commingle

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.330 align:middle line:90%
rather than breeding.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure why they did
that, but the consensus was

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:84%
because they were similar to us,
although their internal organs

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.770 align:middle line:84%
were a little bit different than
us, they were so similar to us

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.710 align:middle line:84%
that they think
that at some point,

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.810 align:middle line:90%
we might have gotten together.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And remember, we had
extraterrestrials in captivity.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And we, even in the time period
when we knew what DNA was,

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:84%
we analyzed their
DNA and there were

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.560 align:middle line:90%
nothing similar to human DNA.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.760 align:middle line:84%
So when we found that
the Pleiadians, wow,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.280 align:middle line:90%
they were similar, that means--

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.160 align:middle line:84%
I can think the consensus in
the geneticists and the doctors

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and the scientists is at
some point in our evolution,

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.144 align:middle line:90%
they became involved.

00:04:16.144 --> 00:04:18.019 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Do you think
they manipulated our DNA

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:18.660 align:middle line:90%
in any sense?

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you're
getting at, or are you

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.240 align:middle line:90%
carefully avoiding that?

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I'm only telling
you what I was told.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Sure.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: OK.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.840 align:middle line:10%
The way they explained
it was that at some point

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.100 align:middle line:10%
in our evolution, we
commingled with the Pleiadians.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.120 align:middle line:10%
Now, I understand your
definition of commingled

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:10%
and whether we can say that
they manipulated our DNA,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.720 align:middle line:10%
I think that could
well be, but I

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle line:10%
think in a safe
way of saying it,

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.680 align:middle line:10%
he referred to it as commingled.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Now the viewers can take away
whatever they want from that.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.620 align:middle line:84%
But because the
DNA was so similar,

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.330 align:middle line:84%
the helix portion,
the different strands,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.870 align:middle line:84%
although they had three
strands, we actually

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.950 align:middle line:84%
have some humans with three
strands on Earth, I was told.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.510 align:middle line:90%
The scientists told me that.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's so similar
that we probably

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.853 align:middle line:84%
had-- they had something
to do with our evolution.

00:05:13.853 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: OK, moving on.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.370 align:middle line:84%
So given how advanced
their DNA is,

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.090 align:middle line:90%
how do they experience illness?

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.970 align:middle line:84%
They must not experience
the same illnesses.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.050 align:middle line:90%
They must recover better.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.470 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference
there in how

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.170 align:middle line:84%
they react to external stimuli
and getting sick or not

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.970 align:middle line:90%
getting sick?

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, first
of all, their DNA

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.390 align:middle line:84%
has some part of
their strand that

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:38.310 align:middle line:84%
prevents mutagens or something
that would mutate their DNA.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, they do
have diseases and they

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.310 align:middle line:84%
do have illnesses and
injuries, but they

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.870 align:middle line:84%
have ways of correcting
these and healing quickly.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And what they use
is a light therapy,

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.830 align:middle line:84%
something that J-Rod
showed us in very early,

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:84%
early days of him being
in captivity or guests--

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't like the word
captivity, but he was a guest.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And he showed us things
that he got out of his craft

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.620 align:middle line:84%
was a light, different
frequency, light spectrums,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.980 align:middle line:84%
which he could
heal himself with.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.400 align:middle line:84%
If he had a cut or something,
the light healed him.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know that
we fully understood that

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.500 align:middle line:84%
and that's not something that
was fully explained to me how

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.820 align:middle line:90%
that worked.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.207 align:middle line:84%
We did try it on humans
and it didn't work.

00:06:26.207 --> 00:06:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: I was going to ask that.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: But maybe because
we were using it wrong,

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.740 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just saying
what Ben told me, was

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.840 align:middle line:84%
we got it and we
used it on humans,

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.660 align:middle line:84%
but maybe their skin texture
or pigments or something

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.340 align:middle line:84%
was different and that light
was only for a Pleiadian.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: OK, got it.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So what did you
find out, or did you

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.840 align:middle line:84%
find out anything about
the Pleiadian lifespan.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.920 align:middle line:90%
Do they live longer than humans?

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They go
through a life cycle,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:84%
which was explained to me
that they're born the same--

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.350 align:middle line:84%
pretty much the same
way human is born.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.930 align:middle line:84%
They go through
life, and then they

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:84%
go through an expiration
period, which lasts about 200

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:08.710 align:middle line:90%
of our years.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: OK.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: So over their
evolutionary advancement,

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.050 align:middle line:84%
they figured out
how to live longer.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:84%
If they could heal their
injuries and their diseases,

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:84%
if we could do that, we
probably would live longer.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think they
also figured out

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.290 align:middle line:84%
how to take away the
aging portion of their DNA

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.670 align:middle line:90%
so they don't age like we age.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, interesting.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So is their lifespan
similar in the sense

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.387 align:middle line:84%
that they have about 18
years growing up as a kid,

00:07:38.387 --> 00:07:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and then they're adult for
the rest of their life?

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:41.270 align:middle line:90%
Or is it slower?

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Is it a different-- is
it different than humans?

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: No, it's pretty
much the same as humans.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Really?

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:46.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Although, here's the
thing that kind of troubled me

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:53.530 align:middle line:84%
when I heard it, is when
a Pleiadian is born,

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:90%
the parents don't raise it.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:00.480 align:middle line:84%
There's a facility with certain
Pleiadian doctors or teachers

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.320 align:middle line:90%
that raises the child.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:84%
At some point in their
lifespan, the child

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:90%
is then given to the parent.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And one strange thing that
really shocked me was they

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.520 align:middle line:90%
have no schools.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.600 align:middle line:84%
They're all taught,
because they're

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.880 align:middle line:84%
so advanced in their
technology, they're

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.120 align:middle line:84%
all taught through
artificial intelligence.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:84%
At certain stages
of their life span,

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:31.946 align:middle line:84%
they're taught in some manner
whatever they needed to know

00:08:31.946 --> 00:08:36.240 align:middle line:84%
and their knowledge is
more advanced than ours.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:90%
So they don't require schools.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: I'm fascinated
by what Pleiadian culture

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.419 align:middle line:90%
and their society could be like.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.294 align:middle line:84%
Like, what's the
similarities and differences

00:08:45.294 --> 00:08:49.000 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to child-rearing,
like family structure?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: OK, most Pleiadians
have two children,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.470 align:middle line:84%
although he said
there are some that

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:84%
have more than two children
or less than two children.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:00.640 align:middle line:90%
They mate for life.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: OK.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And they
live in communes.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.090 align:middle line:90%
They're very family-oriented.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.350 align:middle line:84%
There's no money,
no barter system.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Everything that they need is
issued through their society.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
The structure of
their society is ruled

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.070 align:middle line:90%
by the senior most people.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.630 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a mayor
or a president or a ruler.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.390 align:middle line:84%
They have these
people that guides

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.950 align:middle line:84%
the commune or the Pleiadian
society through life.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.910 align:middle line:84%
They strive for
a Utopian society

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and there's no perfect
entities in the universe.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.590 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's perfect.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.270 align:middle line:90%
And we know that.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.710 align:middle line:90%
Humans aren't perfect.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.310 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, extraterrestrials
aren't perfect.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So there are ups and
downs in their society,

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:56.500 align:middle line:84%
but they cope with it by the
society taking over for them

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and then bringing them out
of whatever kind of problem

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.060 align:middle line:90%
they're having.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.540 align:middle line:90%
There's no divorces.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.060 align:middle line:90%
They mate for life.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.620 align:middle line:84%
If one of the
mates die, they are

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.700 align:middle line:84%
allowed to find another
mate, but probably

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.220 align:middle line:84%
one that already
lost their mate too.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.620 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that Ben
kept saying was life cycles.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.340 align:middle line:90%
I said, you mean their life or?

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.140 align:middle line:90%
He said, no.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.160 align:middle line:84%
They don't refer
to it as a life.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.140 align:middle line:90%
We live our life.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:90%
They don't refer to it.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a cycle.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Now that brings up
a lot of questions.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, was OK,
now, you live a cycle.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Do you come back and
relive that cycle?

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Wait, wait.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.717 align:middle line:90%
Relive or is it reincarnation?

00:10:35.717 --> 00:10:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: He said to relive.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:43.460 align:middle line:84%
So they pass-- there's a
death and then somehow they

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.300 align:middle line:90%
come back to the beginning.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's just how he referred
to it as a life cycle, ending

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.660 align:middle line:90%
and a life cycle beginning.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:57.010 align:middle line:84%
So we can read a lot into that,
whether it's reincarnation

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:02.490 align:middle line:84%
or whether they just are
remanufactured in some way.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
thousands of years

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.370 align:middle line:84%
more advanced in
technology than we are,

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.090 align:middle line:84%
so it probably is more
difficult for us to understand

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.350 align:middle line:84%
what their life cycle
consists of or how it's run,

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:16.530 align:middle line:90%
or how they relive a cycle.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And so that's something that
wasn't fully clear to me,

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.850 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's
fascinating that they

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.730 align:middle line:90%
refer to it as life cycle.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:30.850 align:middle line:84%
We live-- we live and we die,
and then maybe we reincarnated

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:35.370 align:middle line:84%
and maybe our souls
go to another body.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And then another
question I ask him

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.290 align:middle line:90%
is, do they believe in a soul?

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.210 align:middle line:90%
Does a body have a soul?

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:10%
Well, they don't
refer to the soul,

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.690 align:middle line:10%
but they understand
what that means.

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And they have something similar
to that they believe in.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So they have religion or
spirituality, just like we do?

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.167 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yeah, they do.

00:11:54.167 --> 00:11:58.440 align:middle line:84%
They have a deity that they
worship almost every day.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.180 align:middle line:84%
They have symbols
that they worship.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:06.980 align:middle line:84%
These symbols are icons and
figurines that they worship.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle line:90%
And one of the things--

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.760 align:middle line:84%
getting back real quickly
to when the craft crashed

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:84%
in the Nevada desert in 1959,
one of the most important things

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.120 align:middle line:90%
J-Rod asked for was a container.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And that container had
these figurines in it.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.200 align:middle line:84%
That was his religion
and he wanted

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.160 align:middle line:84%
to somehow worship with him or
however they performed that.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And it took some
years before they

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.940 align:middle line:84%
were able to get that because
it was a communications process.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.160 align:middle line:84%
I think right now we
should talk about that.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: OK.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: There was a telepathic
communication system

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:84%
that J-Rod was trying to portray
or instill into the humans,

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:90%
but they weren't grasping it.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And even before they taught
J-Rod the English language,

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:07.910 align:middle line:84%
there were some
particular people,

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:12.870 align:middle line:84%
I'll just say people, that
he had an interface with,

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.030 align:middle line:84%
that they went back
and said he's trying

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.270 align:middle line:90%
to communicate through my mind.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm reading what he's
saying in my mind.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.670 align:middle line:90%
And they tested him.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.030 align:middle line:90%
He's communicating.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And they did
something to show that

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:30.830 align:middle line:84%
what this person, the human
is receiving, is exactly what

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:32.570 align:middle line:90%
that J-Rod wants.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Because before he
learned English,

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:38.710 align:middle line:84%
there was a communication
system through telepathy, only

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.998 align:middle line:84%
through telepathy, until
he learned English.

00:13:40.998 --> 00:13:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Oh, that's interesting.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of
brings up what's

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.550 align:middle line:84%
happening today with these
psionics coming forward

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.010 align:middle line:90%
from the US military.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:49.843 align:middle line:84%
Is J-Rod interacting
with the psionics today

00:13:49.843 --> 00:13:52.427 align:middle line:84%
in that way at all, or do you
know any information about that?

00:13:52.427 --> 00:13:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I would
imagine there probably

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:59.620 align:middle line:84%
would be some form of training
that J-Rod could instill

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:05.780 align:middle line:84%
on the psionic warriors in
the military, the Tango X-Ray

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:06.880 align:middle line:90%
units they call them.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.780 align:middle line:84%
If there is a
program, a learning

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:12.660 align:middle line:84%
program for mind
reading or psionics,

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.920 align:middle line:90%
J-Rod would be part of that.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So earlier you
mentioned that there's no money.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.320 align:middle line:84%
There's this kind of Utopian
society they're striving for.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.360 align:middle line:90%
But is there a barter?

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.840 align:middle line:90%
How do they share resources?

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.000 align:middle line:84%
How does that all
work in this society?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Everything that's needed
by a Pleiadian is given to them.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.240 align:middle line:90%
It's like a supply system.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.900 align:middle line:84%
They need a piece of clothing,
they go to a central depository

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.460 align:middle line:90%
and receive that clothing.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.760 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.100 align:middle line:90%
There's no buying.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the
things that Ben said

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:84%
was when J-Rod first started
speaking English, getting

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.020 align:middle line:84%
to learn the language,
there were so

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.660 align:middle line:84%
many words in the language
that he couldn't compare it to

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.430 align:middle line:84%
in his language, where he
didn't understand what it was.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.850 align:middle line:90%
And one word was money.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:90%
He didn't understand that.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And when they showed
him what money was,

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.430 align:middle line:90%
he still didn't understand it.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:04.390 align:middle line:90%
What's money?

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Why do you have money?

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And when they explained
to him that he

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.450 align:middle line:84%
had to go out and
buy this with money,

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.230 align:middle line:84%
oh, they don't have
anything like that.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.330 align:middle line:84%
If we needed that,
we would go someplace

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.970 align:middle line:90%
and they would give it to us.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.390 align:middle line:90%
That's just the way it is.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:20.110 align:middle line:84%
They strive for the
Utopian society,

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:22.510 align:middle line:84%
the philosophical
perfect society.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.630 align:middle line:84%
One way of doing it
is without money,

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.690 align:middle line:84%
because you know what
money does to our society

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and what has done
over the years.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:33.588 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have that
problem that we have.

00:15:33.588 --> 00:15:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: OK, you're
kind of mentioning

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:39.210 align:middle line:84%
like this utopia or
this pure thinking way

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.530 align:middle line:84%
that the palladium's
show up in the world.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:43.270 align:middle line:90%
Can you elaborate more on that?

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:48.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They are always
striving for utopia

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:56.120 align:middle line:84%
as far as we consider utopia,
a pure thinking, pure acting,

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and pure behavior
in their society.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And as long as they maintain
that, they don't need laws,

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.580 align:middle line:90%
they don't need a military.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Although, they do
have a military.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.400 align:middle line:84%
They don't need police
force because everything

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.600 align:middle line:84%
is standardized
for them and they

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.060 align:middle line:90%
live within those guidelines.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Now I remember Ben
saying, yeah, there

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.880 align:middle line:84%
are always something
that could happen,

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.560 align:middle line:84%
but they have a remedy
for those things.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Rarely that happens.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe somebody gets out of line
or something to that effect.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.080 align:middle line:84%
But he explained that
they do have a military,

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.100 align:middle line:84%
but that's only for
force protection.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:47.560 align:middle line:84%
That's only protecting the
planet, isn't for the people,

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.780 align:middle line:90%
for the Pleiadians.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And they have fought wars
in the past, J-Rod said.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:84%
But once the war is
over with, that's it.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.570 align:middle line:90%
They don't keep a grudge.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.610 align:middle line:90%
They don't try to harm anyone.

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:03.470 align:middle line:84%
They don't try to take
over another planet.

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:04.890 align:middle line:90%
They have their war.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:09.150 align:middle line:84%
It's over with, and they go
back to their own society.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:13.330 align:middle line:84%
It's the closest thing that
we could ever consider utopia.

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Got it.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:15.310 align:middle line:90%
So are they united?

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Like the Pleiadians, they
don't fight with each other.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.569 align:middle line:90%
They're one country in a sense.

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Yeah, here's
another thing hard for us

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:26.750 align:middle line:84%
to understand because we're
a melting pot here in Earth.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.790 align:middle line:90%
Everybody looks different.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:31.070 align:middle line:84%
We have different societies,
different languages.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:34.990 align:middle line:84%
On their planet,
everything is the same.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.570 align:middle line:10%
Although there may
be some differences,

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.230 align:middle line:10%
the slight appearances
between two

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:44.150 align:middle line:10%
Pleiadians, but a female
is distinctly a female.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.630 align:middle line:90%
A male is distinctly a male.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:50.470 align:middle line:84%
They have no problem working
in their own society.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, they don't all
live in one place.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:57.010 align:middle line:84%
There are different societies
or different communes

00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:01.110 align:middle line:84%
that live around the planet,
and they all have to commingle.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:02.030 align:middle line:90%
There are separate.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.050 align:middle line:84%
They live separately, but
when they get together,

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.470 align:middle line:84%
they're all benevolent
to each other.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Got it.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Now, what
I didn't ask him

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.770 align:middle line:84%
about there were wars, I'm
not sure if there was wars

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:16.410 align:middle line:84%
amongst themselves or whether
there were other planets that

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.990 align:middle line:90%
tried to evade him.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, the
Pleiades star system

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:23.330 align:middle line:84%
had thousands of
stars, thousands.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And so they have literally
thousands of planets.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Sure, yeah.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:31.710 align:middle line:10%
>>DOTY: And so we're
only talking about J-Rod

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.230 align:middle line:10%
and we're talking about
his society and his planet.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I asked was, OK,

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:41.490 align:middle line:84%
now you have the thousands of
different sects or communes.

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Is there one particular
somebody, a person or an entity

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.070 align:middle line:90%
that controls all of them?

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.047 align:middle line:90%
No, there's not.

00:18:49.047 --> 00:18:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: What do we know
about the Pleiadians

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.080 align:middle line:84%
like cognitive abilities,
and compare them to humans?

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: They're higher IQ.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.220 align:middle line:90%
Their IQs are probably over 200.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: OK.

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Their cognitive
ability is probably

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.080 align:middle line:84%
we can't even measure
what it would be.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:11.120 align:middle line:84%
But remember, we're
only dealing with J-Rod,

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.920 align:middle line:84%
one particular species
amongst millions.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.060 align:middle line:84%
We relate only to him
and not to others,

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.880 align:middle line:84%
except there were
astronauts that

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:84%
had visited the
planet, his planet,

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.440 align:middle line:84%
and commingled with
others, and they

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:84%
find them to be just as
benevolent as J-Rod is.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:84%
So we can say, I think because
we tested the water, so

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.380 align:middle line:84%
to speak, that everything is
benevolent on that planet.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:90%
They've never harmed anyone.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.000 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to harm anyone.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:84%
But they have a military
only for defense systems.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:54.150 align:middle line:84%
But their ability to do things
and to rationalize things

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:84%
are above and beyond
anything that humans

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.990 align:middle line:84%
can do because their
technology is so advanced.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.030 align:middle line:84%
It's thousands of years
more advanced than we are.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So we can say they've been
around probably 100,000

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.830 align:middle line:84%
to 200,000 years more
than we have in order

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.537 align:middle line:84%
for the advancement
of their technology.

00:20:13.537 --> 00:20:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Yeah, no, that
makes a lot of sense.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.630 align:middle line:84%
But backing up a little
bit with their cognitive

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.870 align:middle line:84%
abilities, what
about consciousness?

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Are they remote viewing?

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Are they doing advanced
consciousness, I guess,

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:25.050 align:middle line:90%
protocols or techniques?

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:26.890 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference
between us and them?

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They are so
advanced in consciousness

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:37.430 align:middle line:84%
that they actually taught us or
taught a group of our astronauts

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:41.450 align:middle line:84%
how to go to the top
level of consciousness.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:44.590 align:middle line:10%
I think it's five or
six or maybe seven.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:47.150 align:middle line:84%
They go in degrees
of consciousness.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:51.340 align:middle line:10%
In order to fly the craft
that they manufactured,

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.740 align:middle line:10%
Cronus 4, the astronauts, our
astronauts, human astronauts,

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:59.900 align:middle line:10%
had to be trained in how to
control their consciousness

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.620 align:middle line:10%
and utilize their consciousness
to fly that craft,

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.620 align:middle line:10%
and it has to be a
six or a seven level.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:12.220 align:middle line:90%
Now on Earth, lucky to have 1.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:17.560 align:middle line:84%
But they're able to go to the
top level of consciousness.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.640 align:middle line:84%
I know I've read a
book on consciousness.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm fascinated
with consciousness.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.420 align:middle line:84%
There are some Indians
from the Indian Tibetans

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.500 align:middle line:84%
and the Buddhist monks have
levels of consciousness,

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's what
they're referring to,

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.580 align:middle line:90%
J-Rod is referring to.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:84%
in order to make your
mind take over something

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and manipulate it so it can
fly a complicated craft,

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.920 align:middle line:84%
you have to really
be on that top level.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.605 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: But what does that mean?

00:21:48.605 --> 00:21:52.228 align:middle line:84%
Just generally talk about level
1 consciousness to level 7.

00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:53.770 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference
and what do you

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.930 align:middle line:84%
have to gain in like skills
or abilities to get there?

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I don't know
the training session,

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.970 align:middle line:84%
but what he said-- and he
went through the training,

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.770 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking to Ben who's
actually gone through it.

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:11.610 align:middle line:84%
He said it's a revelation when
you can go through what they are

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.970 align:middle line:84%
teaching you, what J-Rod,
and it's only J-Rod,

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.610 align:middle line:84%
are teaching you and how to
get to those different levels.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:21.950 align:middle line:84%
He said, consciousness,
he thought,

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.890 align:middle line:84%
was just being
awake and conscious,

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:27.370 align:middle line:84%
but then he realizes
that he starts

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:29.470 align:middle line:84%
developing-- they start
developing systems,

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't go into
how that was trained.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:36.210 align:middle line:84%
But he says when you start
raising your consciousness

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:84%
level, you can start doing
things like moving a phone.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:43.870 align:middle line:84%
He said the first time
that he was trained in it,

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.550 align:middle line:90%
he had a flip phone.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Everybody remembers
the flip phone.

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was on a desk, and
he was able to not only move

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.360 align:middle line:90%
that flip phone, but open it up.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Telekinesis.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Telekinesis.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Part of consciousness.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.560 align:middle line:84%
They don't differentiate
between telekinesis

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.320 align:middle line:84%
or any of the other paranormal
things that we can do.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.920 align:middle line:84%
They just consider it
levels of consciousness.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to a certain
level of consciousness,

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:12.240 align:middle line:84%
you can sit in a spacecraft
and use your mind

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.800 align:middle line:84%
to start the engines
and fly the craft.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Wait, OK, so
if the astronauts have

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.080 align:middle line:84%
to get to level 7 consciousness
to control the craft,

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.480 align:middle line:84%
does that mean that they have
other psychic gifts that they've

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.580 align:middle line:84%
learned through this
training along the way,

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:30.400 align:middle line:84%
like telekinesis, being
clairvoyant, precognition?

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Yes, absolutely.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So every one of these astronauts
have this unique ability that

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.380 align:middle line:90%
was taught to them by J-Rod.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.460 align:middle line:84%
That's why he says
you have that ability.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.560 align:middle line:84%
You just have to be
taught how to use it.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.140 align:middle line:90%
I said, I want to know.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:48.850 align:middle line:84%
I want to be able
to do these things.

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:49.725 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Yeah, me too.

00:23:49.725 --> 00:23:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: And he
said, well, you're

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:54.990 align:middle line:84%
going to have to get a seat
with J-Rod in his classroom.

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:57.470 align:middle line:90%
And so he didn't demonstrate--

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: OK, I was
going to ask that.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: --anything but
he told me he could.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:06.230 align:middle line:84%
But he said, you got to
have to go into a trance,

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:10.870 align:middle line:84%
like Uri Geller does when
he does these things.

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:13.990 align:middle line:84%
So he's one probably
could teach the course to.

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.450 align:middle line:90%
Imagine what level he is.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Although when I start
asking those same questions,

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:22.670 align:middle line:90%
telekinesis, clairvoyance.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:24.198 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no, no, no, no.

00:24:24.198 --> 00:24:25.490 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know what that was.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:26.990 align:middle line:90%
They don't refer to it.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Just level of consciousness.

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So backing up to
the actual planet, what--

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.595 align:middle line:84%
can we describe their
technology there?

00:24:34.595 --> 00:24:36.470 align:middle line:84%
It can be as simple as
their house or the way

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.770 align:middle line:84%
they do business or
the transport systems.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:42.510 align:middle line:84%
What do they have and what would
be something that we don't have

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:44.068 align:middle line:84%
or something beyond
our capabilities

00:24:44.068 --> 00:24:46.610 align:middle line:84%
now on their planet that would
just let the audience be like,

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:48.920 align:middle line:84%
wow, I can't believe the
Pleiadians have that?

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, their houses
are almost pre-fab looking.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Although I didn't see a picture,
he was explaining it to me.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.540 align:middle line:90%
They're all the same.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.100 align:middle line:84%
If you look at one,
they're all the same.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Although he hasn't
been inside and he

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:06.240 align:middle line:84%
can't talk about if there's
a table here, a table there.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.180 align:middle line:84%
But the outer side, the outside,
J-Rod said, are the same.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Now there's free will within
the Pleiadian society.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you live in a-- you
have a family of a wife

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and a husband and
maybe two children,

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.220 align:middle line:84%
their interior or
their house can

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.820 align:middle line:84%
be whatever they want it to
be because it's free will.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Yeah.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.162 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They don't
tell everyone they

00:25:30.162 --> 00:25:33.340 align:middle line:84%
have to have their
fireplace here or whatever.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.860 align:middle line:90%
It's free will.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.060 align:middle line:90%
So that's all the same.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Their transport vehicles
are something that

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.940 align:middle line:90%
is similar to a flying car.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.880 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't operate
on the ground.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.300 align:middle line:90%
It operates in the air.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.630 align:middle line:90%
They do have aircrafts.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:48.970 align:middle line:90%
They do fly.

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you have to fly from
one commune to one that's

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.690 align:middle line:84%
thousands of kilometers
away, then you

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:59.670 align:middle line:84%
would go on some sort of a
space ship or an airplane.

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They have a centralized
communication system,

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:08.330 align:middle line:84%
which is similar to what we
would refer to as a satellite

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:15.650 align:middle line:84%
television, that they get their
instructions or advisements

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:17.370 align:middle line:90%
through this system.

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:20.210 align:middle line:90%
It's both voice and visual.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:24.810 align:middle line:84%
They don't have wires,
transistors, plug-ins.

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Everything is in
some way so advanced

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:32.650 align:middle line:84%
they don't need to plug
a light into a socket.

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:36.710 align:middle line:84%
They have some other technology
that if they need a light,

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.890 align:middle line:84%
this light will light
up by hitting a switch

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:43.010 align:middle line:84%
or something, or maybe
even consciously telling

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:44.650 align:middle line:90%
that light to come on.

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:47.160 align:middle line:84%
The really difficult
things for us to understand

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.200 align:middle line:84%
is they only eat for
nourishment, not for pleasure.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.560 align:middle line:84%
There's no pleasure
in their food.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.520 align:middle line:84%
They eat something similar
to fruits, vegetables.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.660 align:middle line:90%
They don't eat meat.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.540 align:middle line:90%
Although they have animals.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.500 align:middle line:84%
They consider animals
on their planet.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.180 align:middle line:90%
They don't eat those animals.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.220 align:middle line:90%
They don't have pets.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.280 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
dogs or cats, birds.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.240 align:middle line:84%
They don't even know
what a pet would be.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
most common things

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:84%
that they have on that
planet that we have is water.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Although their consistency of
water is a little bit different,

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:22.480 align:middle line:84%
it's extremely
alkaline to our water.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.200 align:middle line:84%
But that's something that
they need and we need,

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.220 align:middle line:90%
is water, that's common.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of other
species of extraterrestrials

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.160 align:middle line:84%
that have visited
Earth that have

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.262 align:middle line:84%
we found it to be the same,
that they require water.

00:27:35.262 --> 00:27:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: It's universal.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain more about
how the environment looks.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:40.060 align:middle line:90%
They have water.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.460 align:middle line:90%
Do they have trees and grass?

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Is it similar to
Earth in any way?

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: They are in more of
a subtropical cooler climate

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.970 align:middle line:90%
than Earth would be.

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:52.550 align:middle line:84%
So they have vegetation, they
have trees, they have plants.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Their northern part
of their planet

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:58.350 align:middle line:84%
is cooler than the southern
part of their planet,

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.030 align:middle line:90%
almost similar to ours.

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Their day is longer
than Earth day.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:07.630 align:middle line:84%
They circle their planet longer
period of time than we do,

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:09.710 align:middle line:90%
more than 365 days.

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Their inclination
isn't like ours.

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:15.830 align:middle line:84%
They do have a protective
layer around their planet,

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:19.870 align:middle line:84%
similar to our magnetic zone
to protect them from radiation.

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.570 align:middle line:84%
They still can be
damaged by radiation.

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:26.390 align:middle line:84%
They're not immune
to radiation burns.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Trees, rocks, soils,
similar to Earth.

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:34.030 align:middle line:90%
They have water, oceans.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:36.510 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
water bodies that

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:41.430 align:middle line:84%
are non-salt. They don't have a
salt ocean, like we have oceans

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:44.670 align:middle line:90%
with salt in them.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Everything is clean water,
drinkable water, so to speak,

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.560 align:middle line:90%
as he said.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Overall colder
though, this is.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: It's cooler within--

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:58.820 align:middle line:84%
and that's one thing I had
to learn because everything

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:84%
that Ben was taught from the
beginning is in metric system.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So he talks about
kilometers or kilograms

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.780 align:middle line:90%
and he's talking about Celsius.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:14.760 align:middle line:84%
So they range between
about 17 to 20 Celsius,

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.320 align:middle line:84%
which is about 60 to
70 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Wow, some would
say that's perfect.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:21.545 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: Absolutely perfect.

00:29:21.545 --> 00:29:22.712 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: That's good weather.

00:29:22.712 --> 00:29:24.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's interesting
about the environment.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:25.160 align:middle line:90%
What about the cities?

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.410 align:middle line:90%
What about their architecture?

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:28.580 align:middle line:90%
Is it like us in any way?

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: They don't have cities.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.400 align:middle line:90%
They have these communes.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.260 align:middle line:90%
They have a series of houses.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:34.700 align:middle line:90%
They're all the same.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.745 align:middle line:84%
And they have a distribution
center within that.

00:29:36.745 --> 00:29:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So there's
no high rises.

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DOTY: There's no high rises.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.960 align:middle line:90%
There's manufacturing centers.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.860 align:middle line:84%
They do have to
manufacture things.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And these are in separate
areas around communes,

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and the people in these
communes work at this factory.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And they make their
spaceships and whatever

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:58.450 align:middle line:90%
needed for their society.

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:00.690 align:middle line:84%
The distribution
centers are there,

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:03.790 align:middle line:84%
but they have distribution and
they have industrial centers.

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: And they're
on the ground,

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:07.132 align:middle line:84%
not like the future humans where
they're floating in the sky.

00:30:07.132 --> 00:30:08.370 align:middle line:90%
These are on the ground.

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:09.953 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: No, they're
all on the ground.

00:30:09.953 --> 00:30:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: OK, interesting.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.383 align:middle line:84%
They figured something out
that we didn't in the future.

00:30:13.383 --> 00:30:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I think they figured
a lot out that we didn't.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So how
does society work?

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Do they all have individual
roles they perform in society?

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Did they get to
choose them freely?

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Every Pleiadian has
a role in their society,

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:33.130 align:middle line:84%
beginning at a particular period
of their lifespan, at which I

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:36.770 align:middle line:84%
think we figured to be
about 18 to 20 years old.

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: So the
Hindus and Buddhism

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:41.070 align:middle line:84%
talks about levels
of consciousness,

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:43.250 align:middle line:84%
and we now know
that J-Rod's talking

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:45.320 align:middle line:84%
about the Pleiadians and
their different levels

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.920 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness and abilities.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Was there ever a time,
or did their culture

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:54.080 align:middle line:84%
ever influence our societies
and our religions in the past?

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: One of
the questions when

00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:02.480 align:middle line:84%
we were able to eventually
speak with J-Rod, Ben told me,

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:08.080 align:middle line:84%
is they asked him, you came
to Earth for what reason?

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things was
that we are travelers,

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:14.520 align:middle line:84%
we're explorers, and
we've been here before.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And now we came back and
it's been a long time for us,

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.760 align:middle line:84%
at least Earth years,
that we came back.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And we have visited other
places on your planet.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And we have instilled
knowledge among the earthlings.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
what that means other

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.000 align:middle line:90%
than they instilled knowledge.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's because they
visited Tibet or India or Nepal

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and instilled knowledge
on the ancient people.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's why there
are-- the Buddhists believe

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:50.270 align:middle line:84%
in similar levels
of consciousness

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:52.210 align:middle line:90%
and maybe that's why.

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:54.690 align:middle line:90%
But he never actually said that.

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:57.550 align:middle line:84%
But they have
visited Earth before,

00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:01.830 align:middle line:84%
and we actually think, Ben
says, we think, and this

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:07.630 align:middle line:84%
is Ben talking, that they have
probably commingled in a way

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:11.830 align:middle line:84%
that we've shared DNA with them
at some point in our evolution.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSH: Commingle.

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:13.690 align:middle line:90%
There's that word again.

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:14.490 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Next time you talk to Ben
or anyone talks to J-Rod,

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:17.983 align:middle line:90%
we have to know more about that.

00:32:17.983 --> 00:32:20.670 align:middle line:84%
That's so compelling if they
were involved in any way

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.582 align:middle line:84%
in shaping our
society or religions.

00:32:22.582 --> 00:32:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, I don't
think it was major,

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:27.230 align:middle line:84%
but I think they probably
had something to do with it.

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:29.430 align:middle line:84%
They were here,
they visited Earth.

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:33.630 align:middle line:84%
They instilled knowledge
into a certain population

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.830 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, whether
it be the Nepalese

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:39.510 align:middle line:90%
or the Indians or the Tibetans.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:44.200 align:middle line:84%
But we have found,
and this is a secret

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and we've talked about
this in an episode

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:51.580 align:middle line:84%
some years ago, that there are
some scriptures and some symbols

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:56.780 align:middle line:84%
or characters that they found
at a Nepalese monastery that is

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.760 align:middle line:90%
similar to the Ebens language.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.860 align:middle line:84%
So maybe there
are some out there

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:05.880 align:middle line:84%
that are similar to the
Pleiadians, I don't know.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the
Pleiadian alphabet is,

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.775 align:middle line:84%
but maybe we can find it if
we really dig deep into it.

00:33:10.775 --> 00:33:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Oh, that's
a whole rabbit hole.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.260 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.060 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Rick, what is your big
takeaway from learning

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.560 align:middle line:84%
all this information
about the Pleiadians?

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.300 align:middle line:84%
What would you like to
share with the audience?

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.633 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: Well, what I would
like to share is, number one,

00:33:21.633 --> 00:33:27.480 align:middle line:84%
J-Rod has contributed so
much to our technology.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Someone who crashed
on our planet, someone

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.780 align:middle line:84%
who was stranded on
our planet, probably

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.660 align:middle line:84%
could have returned
to his planet,

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:41.620 align:middle line:84%
but developed the likeness for
our planet and our society,

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:46.290 align:middle line:84%
at least the people
that he met at Area 51,

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:51.490 align:middle line:84%
and therefore he provided so
much technology advancements

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:54.330 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think we
would be where we are today

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.610 align:middle line:90%
without J-Rod's assistance.

00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:59.490 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to just instill
that we should be thankful

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:03.670 align:middle line:84%
that we had an extraterrestrial,
that came to our planet,

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:06.370 align:middle line:84%
even though he crashed,
and then instilled--

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:09.370 align:middle line:84%
in technology and
probably something

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:12.563 align:middle line:84%
else to our society that
we haven't figured out yet.

00:34:12.563 --> 00:34:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JOSH: Oh, you're
speaking to my heart.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:15.429 align:middle line:90%
I'm just team J-Rod.

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:16.852 align:middle line:90%
I'm team benevolent ETs.

00:34:16.852 --> 00:34:19.310 align:middle line:84%
It's just nice to hear stories
about how they've helped us,

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:21.511 align:middle line:84%
not just the fear porn
we see in the media.

00:34:21.511 --> 00:34:23.469 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a great
way to end this episode.

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Rick, again, thank
you for being here

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and thank you for
sharing this information.

00:34:27.992 --> 00:34:29.909 align:middle line:84%
