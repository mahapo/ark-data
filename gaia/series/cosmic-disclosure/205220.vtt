00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on Cosmic Disclosure,
we are with Ricardo Gonzalez,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.030 align:middle line:10%
Peruvian author and researcher
who has experienced multiple

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.000 align:middle line:10%
direct contacts with an
extraterrestrial species called

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.050 align:middle line:10%
the Apunians.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Today we are talking about the
contact portal on Mount Hermon.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.230 align:middle line:90%
Ricardo, welcome to the show.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.898 align:middle line:84%
(SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) Yes,

00:00:38.898 --> 00:00:42.050 align:middle line:84%
I've had the opportunity to
go to Israel more than once.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a fascinating place.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.350 align:middle line:84%
On one occasion,
I had the chance

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:84%
to visit the sacred mountain
of Israel, Mount Hermon.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.650 align:middle line:84%
It's more like a
chain of mountains

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.210 align:middle line:84%
beyond Israel, which also
includes Lebanon and Syria.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a very dangerous place with
significant military presence

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.980 align:middle line:90%
because it is a tri-border area.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.350 align:middle line:84%
The Israeli military
actually has a base

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.500 align:middle line:90%
at the summit of Mount Hermon.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:84%
But according to
information I have,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.410 align:middle line:84%
the military there is not just
protecting this tri-border

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.160 align:middle line:84%
but also some type of
singularity or phenomenon--

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.000 align:middle line:84%
a portal that can be
found on Mount Hermon.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.310 align:middle line:84%
At another time, you asked
me if there was a difference

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.920 align:middle line:90%
between dimensional portals.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.850 align:middle line:84%
There are dimensional portals
that may provide information.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Others, to have a
personal experience there.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And as we discussed
in another interview,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.540 align:middle line:84%
some have galactic
jurisdiction, if you will.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there an entry point
there that also goes through

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:84%
the three countries
that you're aware of?

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) The whole area

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.180 align:middle line:84%
of Mount Hermon mountain
chain is special,

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:84%
but the main singularity is
found in Israeli territory.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a time portal that connects
to different times of the Earth

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and that connects to other
realities far beyond our world.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:84%
For this reason, that place
was chosen in the past

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.170 align:middle line:84%
to be at the center of
several historic events,

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.400 align:middle line:84%
including one of
extraterrestrial origin.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell us about that.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.593 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) A long time ago,

00:02:19.593 --> 00:02:23.090 align:middle line:84%
thousands of our years, a
mission of extraterrestrials

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.010 align:middle line:90%
was sent to Earth.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:84%
These beings looked human, with
human-like appearance like us.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.760 align:middle line:84%
These beings are known
and experienced contact

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.180 align:middle line:90%
as guardians or watchers.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.810 align:middle line:84%
These guardians' or watchers'
purpose was just that--

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.850 align:middle line:84%
to observe and watch over humans
in that Middle East region.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:90%
But these beings made a mistake.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Even though they were very
developed extraterrestrials

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.970 align:middle line:84%
and had a very
specific role, they

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.530 align:middle line:84%
found themselves involved
with an external influence--

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.290 align:middle line:84%
an unknown influence
that upset them

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.110 align:middle line:84%
and caused them
to make mistakes.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.420 align:middle line:84%
These beings chose to
land in what is now

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.120 align:middle line:84%
known as Mount
Hermon because it is

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.900 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important
time portals in this world.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.000 align:middle line:84%
At that time, they then
mixed with the daughters

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.440 align:middle line:90%
of humankind--

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.750 align:middle line:90%
the daughters of Earth.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.270 align:middle line:84%
These beings were not
angels, like a lot

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.280 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient scriptures say.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.670 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
cosmonauts from other worlds.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So these beings
from other worlds

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:84%
mixed with the
women of the Earth

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.100 align:middle line:84%
because they were
anatomically compatible.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:84%
In the scriptures,
their hybrid children

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.080 align:middle line:84%
are described as
a race of Giants--

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.690 align:middle line:90%
three generations of Giants--

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.250 align:middle line:84%
where one of them were
named Nephilim or Nephili.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.780 align:middle line:84%
The important thing
about this case

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.170 align:middle line:84%
that happened on Mount
Hermon is that it preceded

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:84%
other hybridization
episodes that happened

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.880 align:middle line:84%
in different parts of
the world, generating

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.340 align:middle line:90%
a prohibited race of Giants--

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.000 align:middle line:84%
children of extraterrestrials
and Earth women.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.210 align:middle line:84%
In a very old text known
as the Book of Enoch,

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.310 align:middle line:84%
it is said that 200 beings
descended on Mount Hermon.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Their commander
was named Samyaza,

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.160 align:middle line:84%
and he, with all the
group under his command,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.800 align:middle line:84%
taught forbidden
knowledge to the humans.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Aside from creating
hybridisation

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.510 align:middle line:84%
with Earth women,
when this occurred,

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.920 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial alliance
that was monitoring our world

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:84%
separated these beings from
the process of our world.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Because of this
mistake that they made,

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.900 align:middle line:84%
they were relieved
of their duties,

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and the Giant children were
gathered together and taken

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.850 align:middle line:84%
to lands far from where
human beings lived

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.600 align:middle line:84%
because the Giants should not
mix with the human process,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.180 align:middle line:84%
because they were children
of extraterrestrials.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.120 align:middle line:84%
But some of these Giants
wanted to live with humans

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.800 align:middle line:84%
because they were also human,
because their mothers were

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.600 align:middle line:90%
human.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.140 align:middle line:84%
But the alliance that was
monitoring planet Earth

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.820 align:middle line:84%
isolated them and gathered them
in an archipelago of islands

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.150 align:middle line:84%
in the Atlantic Ocean,
isolated from the rest

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:90%
of the cultures of the world.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.230 align:middle line:84%
But at some point,
these Giants began

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.110 align:middle line:84%
to leave their
confinement and tried

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.900 align:middle line:90%
to mingle with humanity again.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.420 align:middle line:84%
That race of Giants
is extinct now.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.710 align:middle line:90%
They disappeared.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Humans hunted them down and
allowed them to become extinct.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.550 align:middle line:84%
However, nevertheless, something
very important happened.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.940 align:middle line:84%
These Giants also
created hybridisation

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle line:84%
with some women of
the Earth, and trend

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.880 align:middle line:84%
spurred part of that
first hybridisation that

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.800 align:middle line:90%
happened on Mount Hermon.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.230 align:middle line:84%
The original Giants
of Mount Hermon

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.110 align:middle line:90%
were born with polidactilia.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And is this the
Anunnaki story?

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.198 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) When we speak

00:05:51.198 --> 00:05:54.100 align:middle line:84%
of the Anunnaki, we're actually
referring to an old Sumerian

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.000 align:middle line:90%
legend.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Because Anu was the
deity of the heavens,

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and those who came
from the heavens

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and arrived on the Earth
could be called Anunnaki--

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.680 align:middle line:84%
in other words,
extraterrestrials.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:84%
With that, indeed,
they were sons of Anu--

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:90%
sons of the heavens.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the Bible,
in Genesis chapter 6,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.010 align:middle line:84%
it says that the sons of
heaven, the children of God,

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.320 align:middle line:84%
when they saw how beautiful
the daughters of men

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.620 align:middle line:84%
were, they came together
and bore giants.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
The Bible also
mentions that they

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:90%
were born with six fingers--

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.970 align:middle line:84%
six fingers on each hand
and six toes on each foot.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.520 align:middle line:84%
In other words, 24
digits in total--

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:84%
something very interesting
in this genetic mutation,

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.790 align:middle line:90%
if it occurred that way.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.970 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about an
extraterrestrial species

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.400 align:middle line:84%
with a human appearance
that we could

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:84%
relate to the myth
of the Anunnaki

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.470 align:middle line:84%
who joined certain
groups of human beings

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and bore giant
children, which placed

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.650 align:middle line:84%
the Homo sapiens
evolutionary process at risk.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And this started
on Mount Hermon,

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.770 align:middle line:84%
then it was repeated in other
areas of the Middle East,

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.060 align:middle line:84%
including North Africa,
like in Algeria or Egypt.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.720 align:middle line:84%
However, the story has somehow
continued even to this day.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.860 align:middle line:84%
2000 years ago, Jesus
Christ, Jesus of Nazareth,

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.620 align:middle line:84%
traveled to Mount Hermon,
and it was on that mountain

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:84%
where he experienced
his transfiguration.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.020 align:middle line:84%
It was not on Mount Tabor
like many Christians currently

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.820 align:middle line:90%
believe.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.320 align:middle line:90%
It was on Mount Hermon.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Because, in fact, the
scriptures mentioned

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.520 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus was with his
disciples by Caesarea Philippi.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.670 align:middle line:84%
According to ancient
scriptures like the Bible,

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was around Mount
Hermon before going up

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.000 align:middle line:90%
to the Mount of Transfiguration.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:84%
The Mount of Transfiguration
is Mount Hermon.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Jesus went up it in the company
of some of his disciples,

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.740 align:middle line:84%
and on the mountain high,
two figures appeared.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.420 align:middle line:84%
One of them was Elijah,
and the other was Moses--

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.390 align:middle line:84%
two individuals who
had already had contact

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:02.440 align:middle line:84%
experiences in the
past, who had had

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.190 align:middle line:84%
their encounters with the
chariots of fire of the angels.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.020 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some of
his disciples wanted

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.160 align:middle line:84%
to erect three tents for Jesus
and his invisible, or bright,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.680 align:middle line:90%
companions.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Peter the disciple
was completely

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.160 align:middle line:84%
shocked seeing Jesus walking
with these luminous beings.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Why did all of
this happen there?

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a time portal,
and important people

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.430 align:middle line:84%
from other times
met with Jesus then.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.309 align:middle line:84%
After this ascension
to Mount Hermon

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:35.020 align:middle line:84%
is when the final
and fundamental part

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.120 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus's mission began.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Jesus went to Mount
Hermon because he

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.140 align:middle line:90%
was looking for water.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.850 align:middle line:84%
The water there
on Mount Hermon is

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:46.060 align:middle line:84%
very special for these
dimensional portals.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.970 align:middle line:84%
We can't forget that Jesus
began his public ministry

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:54.370 align:middle line:84%
at the Jordan River where he was
baptized by John the Baptist.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.160 align:middle line:84%
The Jordan River
originates at Mount Hermon.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, after being baptized,
goes to the source.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So on Mount Hermon is where
Jesus had that contact.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And with that
contact, he attempted

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:11.170 align:middle line:84%
to seal the mistake of the
200 angels from the past.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:15.640 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about 200
extraterrestrial beings made

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.490 align:middle line:90%
a mistake on that mountain.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.870 align:middle line:90%
The Giants were born.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And thousands of
years later, Jesus

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.300 align:middle line:84%
was going to that
same mountain to close

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:90%
something that had been opened.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Now there we find one of the
most dangerous military places

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.720 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.920 align:middle line:84%
This is obviously
not a coincidence,

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:90%
but I do insist on something.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:39.040 align:middle line:84%
The legacy of the brotherhood
of the six fingers

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.500 align:middle line:84%
that comes from this
lineage of Giants

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.770 align:middle line:84%
is still alive today
in shamanic circles,

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:48.310 align:middle line:84%
and it is one of the
biggest, deepest secrets

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:90%
of the dimensional portals.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Who are these shamans,
and what is their practice

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.760 align:middle line:90%
and message?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.718 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) We don't have

00:09:55.718 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:84%
to go too far to
understand it, Emery.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a place that
I'm sure very well

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.850 align:middle line:90%
here in your country--

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.500 align:middle line:90%
New Mexico.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Many things have happened
there linked to UFO phenomena.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.290 align:middle line:84%
But much before the existence of
all these cases of crafts that

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:15.280 align:middle line:84%
crashed in New Mexico,
very important,

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Native American
communities existed,

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.690 align:middle line:90%
indigenous to the area--

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:25.810 align:middle line:84%
shamans, who left very special
marks and signs in petroglyphs.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.880 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
their petroglyphs,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.120 align:middle line:84%
there are references
to strange entities

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and also markings of
hands with six fingers.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.810 align:middle line:84%
For example, at Three
Rivers Park, right?

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.027 align:middle line:84%
I'm very familiar with this,
of course, because, you know,

00:10:41.027 --> 00:10:42.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm from there.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And the most amazing
thing is I can definitely

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.560 align:middle line:84%
attest to the petroglyphs
because I've seen them myself

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.840 align:middle line:90%
there with the six fingers.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.390 align:middle line:84%
How does New Mexico
connect to Mount Hermon?

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.432 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) The connection,

00:10:56.432 --> 00:10:57.810 align:middle line:90%
first of all, is historical.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Because if we consider what the
Bible says, the Book of Enoch

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.200 align:middle line:84%
that I was referring
to, in the context

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.840 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial information
that I affirm that I have

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.020 align:middle line:84%
received, the first
Giants with six digits

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.240 align:middle line:90%
appeared on Mount Hermon.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.790 align:middle line:84%
From the descendents
of these Giants

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:19.290 align:middle line:84%
emerged the anomaly
of six fingers

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:23.280 align:middle line:84%
that has been inherited
over time up to our day.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.170 align:middle line:84%
When someone in
a shamanic circle

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:30.000 align:middle line:84%
is born with six fingers on
either their hand or foot,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:84%
they're considered to
be a child of the gods,

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.690 align:middle line:84%
not knowing this story of
Mount Hermon, of course.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:84%
But in their shamanic beliefs,
a boy or a girl with six digits

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.800 align:middle line:90%
was a child of the gods.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.100 align:middle line:90%
They were special.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Within the shamanic circle,
when a special place

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.730 align:middle line:84%
was found, where
a child with six

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.820 align:middle line:84%
digits with psychic
abilities had identified

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:58.600 align:middle line:84%
a vortex, to mark that
place and not forget it,

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.610 align:middle line:84%
they would leave an imprint
with six fingers in cave art,

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:06.570 align:middle line:84%
either with petroglyphs
or with paint.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Not only in New Mexico
but, specifically,

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.780 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
Americas, many places

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.660 align:middle line:84%
of contact that are
known in the Americas

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:21.090 align:middle line:84%
have petroglyphs or paintings
of hands with six fingers.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.450 align:middle line:84%
This is also related to
a more recent migration

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:84%
that happened in the
Americas from the East,

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.660 align:middle line:84%
where the last guardians
of knowledge from the Altai

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Mountains in Siberia,
in the last Ice Age,

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.700 align:middle line:84%
according to what our
historians believe,

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.190 align:middle line:84%
they crossed over to America
going all the way to South

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:42.990 align:middle line:90%
America.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the connection
between Jesus and these

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.620 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials
from Mount Hermon?

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) There's a very

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.580 align:middle line:84%
profound connection
between Jesus in the flesh

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.950 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrial contact.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.290 align:middle line:84%
But before I delve
into this topic,

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.180 align:middle line:90%
allow me to say a few things.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.090 align:middle line:84%
For the people who are watching
me now in this interview,

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:03.600 align:middle line:84%
I am very respectful of
all religious beliefs,

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.110 align:middle line:84%
but I also believe that
our religions have often

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:11.310 align:middle line:84%
manipulated our
historical events.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I have a deep respect
for the great people

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.570 align:middle line:84%
in the history of humanity,
like Moses, Buddha, or Jesus,

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:19.890 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.980 align:middle line:84%
I consider Jesus to be an
actual historical figure--

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:27.450 align:middle line:84%
beyond faith and religion
and what was later created--

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:30.120 align:middle line:84%
and I say this with
the deepest respect.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Having said that, Jesus is
one of the most important

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.000 align:middle line:90%
hierarchies of this planet.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:84%
For these beings
from other worlds,

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.740 align:middle line:84%
these extraterrestrials,
Jesus is

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:46.090 align:middle line:84%
one of the figures of this
Earth who has shown them truly

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.760 align:middle line:90%
how illuminated humans may be.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.760 align:middle line:84%
According to them,
his birth was planned.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.930 align:middle line:90%
His life was monitored.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was not an
extraterrestrial.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But according to the information
that I have received,

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials were observing
the historic events of his life

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.530 align:middle line:84%
because they knew that the
things that happened to Jesus

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.860 align:middle line:84%
were going to be extraordinarily
influential in the Earth's

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:10.660 align:middle line:90%
history.

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Jesus' life is full of peculiar
events linked to the UFO

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.460 align:middle line:84%
phenomena, starting with
the star that was guiding

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.190 align:middle line:90%
the wise men to his birthplace.

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Aside from what some
astronomers believe

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.770 align:middle line:84%
about an alignment or
other celestial signs,

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.170 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about an
actual bright object

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.560 align:middle line:84%
in the sky that was moving
and that was stopping,

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.870 align:middle line:90%
guiding the three wise men.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:38.680 align:middle line:84%
All Jesus' life was followed
by the extraterrestrials,

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:84%
and Mount Hermon was
a culminating event.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.010 align:middle line:84%
I feel that the friendly
group of extraterrestrials

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:48.320 align:middle line:84%
that I've spoken
about wanted Jesus

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.340 align:middle line:84%
to be able to close something
up on Mount Hermon--

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:55.210 align:middle line:84%
the mistake that was made by
the other group of beings.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle line:84%
This would mean that the
portal on Mount Hermon

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:00.160 align:middle line:90%
would be closed and secure.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.100 align:middle line:84%
But every so often,
there are small cracks

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.350 align:middle line:90%
of time in that portal.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:09.190 align:middle line:84%
When these open up, events
are affected on our planet.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.460 align:middle line:84%
I have information that there
is an active crack right now

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.940 align:middle line:84%
on Mount Hermon that coincides
with all of the world events

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.850 align:middle line:84%
that we're facing right
now, but this time there's

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.340 align:middle line:90%
no Jesus to come seal it up.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Humanity itself
has to take action

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.840 align:middle line:90%
to withstand this influence.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.770 align:middle line:90%
I know how all this sounds.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.750 align:middle line:90%
I know that it sounds crazy.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:34.270 align:middle line:84%
But if you research the story
of angels and Jesus' life,

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:39.070 align:middle line:84%
you can contrast it with ufology
and extraterrestrial contacts.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.040 align:middle line:84%
You will be very,
very surprised.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.615 align:middle line:84%
>> So why do you call this
place a portal of time?

00:15:45.615 --> 00:15:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) Basically, Emery,

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:52.480 align:middle line:84%
all portals that are within
dimensions are time portals.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.840 align:middle line:84%
But there are some special
points on planet Earth

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.080 align:middle line:84%
that are great time portals
in and of themselves.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Because in those vortexes,
different historical realities

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:07.450 align:middle line:84%
are superimposed, not
just the Earth's timeline

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.640 align:middle line:84%
but also other
historic timelines

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.920 align:middle line:90%
beyond the Earth itself.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Those vortexes on Earth that
have this special power,

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.440 align:middle line:84%
I call those the
great portals of time.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.670 align:middle line:84%
The two biggest ones
that I have seen,

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Mount Hermon that
I'm mentioning now,

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.140 align:middle line:84%
which I haven't
experienced yet but I

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.390 align:middle line:84%
have this information,
and the other one

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:32.020 align:middle line:84%
that I have experienced at
the heart of the Gobi Desert

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.010 align:middle line:90%
in Mongolia.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.927 align:middle line:84%
>> So this crack that you
speak of, who is behind that?

00:16:36.927 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) Obviously,

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.770 align:middle line:84%
it's not an influence
that, as humans,

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:44.690 align:middle line:84%
we would consider
friendly or positive.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:48.440 align:middle line:84%
It is an influence that has the
signature of the fallen angels

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.150 align:middle line:84%
of Mount Hermon and also of
some of their Giant children

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.460 align:middle line:90%
who were jealous of humanity.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And that energy is
trapped in this world.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.200 align:middle line:90%
It can confuse.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.270 align:middle line:90%
It can interfere.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And it is one of the
black books of ufology

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:10.069 align:middle line:84%
that has inspired a lot of
conspiracy theories and books

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:13.130 align:middle line:84%
exaggerating or
distorting things.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:18.349 align:middle line:84%
But Mount Hermon continues to be
the mountain of time and Israel

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:21.710 align:middle line:84%
the country of the
clock of prophecies,

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:23.960 align:middle line:84%
or anything that
can possibly happen

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.670 align:middle line:84%
in the future of humanity is
reflected there like a mirror.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:32.810 align:middle line:84%
The water that is consumed in
Israel comes from Mount Hermon.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Mount Hermon also
represents the conflict

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.700 align:middle line:90%
with neighboring countries--

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:41.630 align:middle line:84%
situations that, at some point,
humanity has to overcome.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.060 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, the
extraterrestrials

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.130 align:middle line:90%
chose that place to land.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
like I already mentioned,

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Jesus of Nazareth also
chose that mountain.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.323 align:middle line:84%
>> So this crack in the
mountain, well, what is this?

00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) I'm speaking

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.860 align:middle line:84%
of a subtle influence of energy
that every so often flows from

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.350 align:middle line:90%
places like Mount Hermon.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:07.070 align:middle line:84%
I remember a passage in the
scriptures in the Bible,

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:10.100 align:middle line:84%
specifically,
Ephesians 6, when it

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.900 align:middle line:84%
speaks of war
among human beings,

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.740 align:middle line:84%
it's not against entities
of flesh and bone

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.590 align:middle line:84%
but rather against
celestial powers.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>> If these negative energies
are coming out of Mount Hermon,

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:24.588 align:middle line:84%
are there any energies going
back into Mount Hermon?

00:18:24.588 --> 00:18:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) The cracks that

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:31.070 align:middle line:84%
may be opened in Earth's time
portals are like a sponge

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:32.600 align:middle line:90%
phenomena.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.020 align:middle line:84%
When a sponge is full of
water, you can squeeze it,

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.850 align:middle line:90%
and the water runs out.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a crack that emits
energy or influence,

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.690 align:middle line:90%
like we're seeing now.

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:45.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you take the same
sponge and you put it in water,

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.730 align:middle line:90%
it absorbs it.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:84%
So these cracks in time also
absorb our mental energy.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.840 align:middle line:84%
As a human species,
if our mental energy

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:59.000 align:middle line:84%
is unorganized or dark, we keep
the anomaly, or crack, active.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.730 align:middle line:84%
The time portals, as I
call them on the planet,

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and I'm referring to the great
time portals such as Mount

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Hermon, when they enter
these periods of anomaly,

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:12.050 align:middle line:84%
where they do begin to
filter some of the energy

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:14.090 align:middle line:84%
that they have
trapped there, they

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:84%
generate this phenomena
of recycling our emotions.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't happen
like in the times of Jesus

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:25.520 align:middle line:84%
when a very conscious being
like him can confront a portal,

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.950 align:middle line:84%
not even with our
current technology.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.470 align:middle line:84%
It has to be through a
shift in consciousness

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:34.460 align:middle line:84%
of a very important segment
of our world population.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.570 align:middle line:84%
If we stop feeding these cracks
with fear, concern, disorder,

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:43.820 align:middle line:84%
violence, obviously, we will be
able to transform everything,

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.760 align:middle line:84%
feeding the planet with a
higher, much more positive

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.290 align:middle line:90%
vibration.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Mount Hermon, I want
to emphasize this,

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.540 align:middle line:90%
is not a negative portal.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.470 align:middle line:84%
It's just a great portal in
time where very dramatic things

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.890 align:middle line:84%
happened, like the
falling of angels,

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.640 align:middle line:84%
the origin of the Giants,
and very illuminating events,

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.370 align:middle line:84%
such as the
transfiguration of Christ.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:10.790 align:middle line:84%
In other words, portals
behave according to facts.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:15.140 align:middle line:84%
In this time in our history,
Mount Hermon in Israel

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.350 align:middle line:90%
is a key to the times to come.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.420 align:middle line:84%
For example, there is
important symbolism

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:90%
with the figure of Jesus.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.280 align:middle line:84%
It's believed that
when Jesus was born,

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.940 align:middle line:84%
there was an alignment
between Jupiter and Saturn

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.250 align:middle line:84%
that was very powerful
and could be seen

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle line:90%
like a great light in the sky.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Saturn represents
Cronos, time, and Jupiter

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.920 align:middle line:84%
represents the Great
Master, the teacher,

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.300 align:middle line:90%
the one who brings order.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So a great teacher of
time had been born.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.210 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
interpretations

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:48.770 align:middle line:90%
of the Star of Bethlehem.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:50.570 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, the
Star of Bethlehem

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:53.180 align:middle line:84%
was an extraterrestrial
ship, but there was also

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.530 align:middle line:90%
an alignment.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.480 align:middle line:90%
This just happened again.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.300 align:middle line:84%
It happens every so
often on our planet.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.120 align:middle line:84%
But for it to be
visible at night,

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.510 align:middle line:84%
800 years had to
go by so that you

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:09.470 align:middle line:84%
could see Jupiter and
Saturn meeting in our skies.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:13.610 align:middle line:84%
In the year of the pandemic,
we had a series of signs--

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:17.300 align:middle line:84%
eclipses, the alignment
of Jupiter and Saturn,

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.100 align:middle line:84%
the activation of
various volcanoes,

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.930 align:middle line:90%
like Krakatoa in Indonesia.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Climate change is
also intensified.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And when all of these types of
signs are organized in a group,

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.010 align:middle line:84%
it almost always coincides
with a time portal

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:32.540 align:middle line:90%
functioning on Earth.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.450 align:middle line:84%
But a big one like
Mount Hermon, there's

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.070 align:middle line:84%
a story that we
still haven't fully

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.330 align:middle line:84%
understood about Mount Hermon
and the extraterrestrials

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.080 align:middle line:84%
because there was an
agenda that was never

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.900 align:middle line:84%
fulfilled-- that was interrupted
by these extraterrestrials'

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.770 align:middle line:90%
mistake.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Then this army of
Giants appeared, putting

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.540 align:middle line:90%
the human experience at risk.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:84%
It generated another
anomaly in our timeline.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Part of that history
that we don't know

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.400 align:middle line:84%
is still closed
inside the library

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.140 align:middle line:90%
of time of Mount Hermon.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.750 align:middle line:84%
That's all that I can say
on television about that.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>> So where do we go from now?

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.992 align:middle line:90%
What's your thoughts on it?

00:22:07.992 --> 00:22:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) We don't know

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:11.720 align:middle line:90%
exactly.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Usually, when a time portal is
emanating this type of energy,

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:20.120 align:middle line:84%
it is generally for
short periods of time,

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.190 align:middle line:90%
according to our perception--

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.280 align:middle line:84%
a few years or
sometimes a few months.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.280 align:middle line:84%
While that is happening, the
world is turned upside down.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.100 align:middle line:84%
But it is also an
opportunity to listen

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.090 align:middle line:90%
to get in tune with ourselves.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:36.770 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if a
great library in Egypt

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:41.360 align:middle line:84%
or another ancient country were
closed, with all its windows

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.920 align:middle line:84%
and curtains
closed, not allowing

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.640 align:middle line:84%
you to see inside that library,
and then suddenly something

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.030 align:middle line:84%
happens and a curtain
was left open.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you approach
the window, at least

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:56.830 align:middle line:84%
you can see from there what
books are inside that library--

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.810 align:middle line:84%
at least those that are
close enough for you to see.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.370 align:middle line:84%
If your vision is
such that you are

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:04.310 align:middle line:84%
able to see a book
open on a table,

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.160 align:middle line:84%
possibly, you can even
read a fragment, a line,

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:90%
from the pages of the open book.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.330 align:middle line:84%
That happens with the
great portals of time.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:16.010 align:middle line:84%
There are immense
libraries of Earth's events

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:19.130 align:middle line:84%
that are humanly
impossible for us to read,

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:23.030 align:middle line:84%
but you can at least comprehend
a sliver of that reality.

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:24.470 align:middle line:90%
And for what?

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Is it just out of spiritual
or intellectual curiosity?

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.170 align:middle line:90%
Jesus himself gave the answer.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:31.560 align:middle line:90%
"I will give you knowledge.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.050 align:middle line:90%
I will give you the truth.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And the truth will
set you free."

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.320 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge liberates.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Ricardo, thank you again
for being on the show.

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.595 align:middle line:90%
It's always a pleasure.

00:23:41.595 --> 00:23:43.637 align:middle line:84%
>> (SPEAKING THROUGH
INTERPRETER) It's a pleasure

00:23:43.637 --> 00:23:44.870 align:middle line:90%
to be with you again, Emery.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Emery Smith,
and this is Cosmic Disclosure.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:49.780 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:23:49.780 --> 00:24:01.000 align:middle line:90%
