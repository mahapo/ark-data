>> EMERY SMITH: Today
on Cosmic Disclosure,

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.920 align:middle line:10%
we are with Randy Cramer who
has participated in a covert

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.500 align:middle line:10%
military space program for 18
years called the Earth Defense

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:10%
Force.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Today we are talking about
psionic abilities of ETs.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.257 align:middle line:90%
Randy, welcome to the show.

00:00:34.257 --> 00:00:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>> RANDY CRAMER:
Thanks for having me,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.423 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: For the
sake of our viewers,

00:00:37.423 --> 00:00:39.960 align:middle line:84%
can you explain what
psionics means actually?

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Sure.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Psi is a root word
that means mind.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Onic is another
suffix that means

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:57.230 align:middle line:84%
either the way of or a wave of
or method of or way of, anyway.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically
just your mind powers.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is it
similar to telepathy?

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Telepathy would
be a psionic ability.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Got it.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:90%
Now do all--

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Telekinesis
would be a psionic ability.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Telepathy would be
a psionic ability.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Precognition would
be a psionic ability.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.460 align:middle line:90%
Et cetera.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.560 align:middle line:90%
Psionics would be the category.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Any skill would be an
ability under that category.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Now do all ETs
have psionic abilities?

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: No.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.210 align:middle line:84%
All species are not
universal in this way.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.950 align:middle line:84%
You have what we
often simply refer

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.720 align:middle line:90%
to as the psionic species.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Species who live a daily
existence in which psionics

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.860 align:middle line:84%
is part of their
upbringing, from childhood,

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:84%
part of their adolescent,
and adult life and part

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.240 align:middle line:90%
of their everyday existence.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Psionically-emergent species
are like what we are,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:84%
where some people are
experiencing their lives

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:84%
as a psionic experience
all the time.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.380 align:middle line:90%
Some people are not.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And some people are, but
don't realize that they are.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
non-psionic species.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.100 align:middle line:84%
There are species
that do not seem

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.330 align:middle line:84%
to have a protensity to develop
psionic skills and abilities.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.497 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure what in their
genetics or lack thereof maybe

00:02:12.497 --> 00:02:13.330 align:middle line:90%
the reason for that.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.240 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
species that do not

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.310 align:middle line:84%
seem to have any psionic
ability whatsoever.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.700 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: Do they mention which
species has the best psionic

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.335 align:middle line:10%
abilities and which species
or race has the worst?

00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I wouldn't certainly
know what would be on the worst

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:90%
end of that list.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.420 align:middle line:84%
But the most evolved species
psionically are certainly

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.660 align:middle line:90%
the creator species.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.250 align:middle line:84%
The ones that have just been
around longer and have millions

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.340 align:middle line:90%
of years of mind to develop.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: A highly
developed species.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Does that also
mean they're going

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.670 align:middle line:90%
to have high psionic abilities?

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Not a guarantee.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I would say more often
than not, a species that

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.660 align:middle line:84%
is more developed,
there is a likelihood

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.210 align:middle line:84%
that they will be also
psionically developed.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Those things usually come
hand in hand over time.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.350 align:middle line:84%
But a species
doesn't necessarily

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.170 align:middle line:84%
have to be psionic
to be developed.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:84%
You can be a developed species
with a developed civilization.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.120 align:middle line:84%
You can still have evolution
without psionic development.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Even though they
mostly go hand in hand.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.150 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
exceptions, Obviously,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.280 align:middle line:84%
that has something to
do with genetics that I

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.630 align:middle line:84%
can't explain because I
don't know enough about it.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Could you tell
us about the development

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.950 align:middle line:84%
of psionics through the
species in the whole universe?

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.940 align:middle line:90%
Is there like a tier format?

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.930 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, I mean,
there's certainly fundamentals

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.690 align:middle line:84%
and basics which every species
learns some version of.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.440 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, you have a
tube that goes through your body

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.150 align:middle line:90%
that you can't see mine.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.350 align:middle line:90%
I can't see yours right now.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's a central tube
in which all energy,

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.060 align:middle line:84%
subtle cosmic pronic,
Chi or otherwise,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.960 align:middle line:90%
moves through your body.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So every species starts with
you have a central tube.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
chakras, or what

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:84%
we call psionic foci, which
depending on what system

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.800 align:middle line:84%
you're using, what planet
you're on, how your biology is.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Depends on whether you
have 7, 8, 5, 3, 12, 18,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.990 align:middle line:90%
or whatever that number is.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.270 align:middle line:84%
But your species
is going to define

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.860 align:middle line:90%
that you have a central tube.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:90%
You have psionic foci.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.710 align:middle line:90%
You have channels.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And then pretty much
universally breathing

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:84%
is what moves energy
through those channels.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And then developing some sort
of cranial defense, body defense

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.550 align:middle line:84%
to keep things out,
keep things in.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Keep your things in and
other people's stuff out.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Those are basic
fundamentals that you

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.710 align:middle line:84%
would learn in some
form or another

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.040 align:middle line:84%
in any psionically-emergent
psionic species

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.380 align:middle line:84%
where some fundamentals
are taught.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.750 align:middle line:84%
It all starts with the
most basic fundamentals,

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:84%
which are what are the most
basic elements that you have

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.900 align:middle line:84%
as an energy body to start with
that your mind has the ability

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.460 align:middle line:84%
to affect through
mental focus, thought,

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.030 align:middle line:84%
emotion, et cetera,
that can change

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.070 align:middle line:90%
how that energy is behaving.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And from that very
get go you have,

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, am I moving
energy up or down?

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.990 align:middle line:90%
Moving left or right?

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And from that elementary,
kindergarten point of view,

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.880 align:middle line:84%
development over time
turns into telepathy,

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:90%
telekinesis, precognition.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.800 align:middle line:84%
More developed
skills and abilities.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:84%
At our school I teach that your
brain is like a psionic muscle.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And that it's like a
little baby arm that's

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.700 align:middle line:84%
like wiggling all over the
place and can't do anything.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And you if you exercise that
psionic brain muscle over time,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:84%
it will get stronger and
steadier and more coordinated.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And so it is really just
the development and use

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.040 align:middle line:84%
over time, which takes a
person, any person or being,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:84%
from an emergent state to a
psionic state through practice.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.280 align:middle line:90%
Practice.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.970 align:middle line:90%
Practice.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Practice.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Which is what leads
to development.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Can you talk about
specific psionic races that

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.640 align:middle line:90%
stand out in your mind?

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Sure.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.900 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, since we were talking
about the Draconians before.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
awful and horrible,

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:84%
but they're also very
psionically developed.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's a great
place to start.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Again, their main tools
that they use psionically

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.560 align:middle line:84%
are trickery, deception,
illusion, fear.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:10%
Things that feel very real or
seem very real, but sometimes

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.600 align:middle line:10%
aren't at all.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.570 align:middle line:84%
I would say the majority
of their psionic usage

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.390 align:middle line:84%
is projecting fear
and projecting terror

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:58.230 align:middle line:84%
and projecting their
largeness, which

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.020 align:middle line:84%
keeps other people feeling
very small in front of them.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.610 align:middle line:84%
But again, that's a
very illusory projection

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.005 align:middle line:90%
that they are that large.

00:07:07.005 --> 00:07:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Could they take
a life with that ability?

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Sure.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.180 align:middle line:84%
A developed psionic soldier
could certainly kill someone

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:90%
using their psionic ability.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.320 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.093 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: Could they
make you kill yourself?

00:07:20.093 --> 00:07:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: That would depend
on the psionic strength

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.120 align:middle line:90%
of the individual in question.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.460 align:middle line:84%
At that point, you're
talking about let's say,

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.020 align:middle line:90%
here's the attacker.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Here's the defender.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.540 align:middle line:84%
If psionic amplitudes are
here, the attacker wins.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.690 align:middle line:84%
If psionic amplitudes are
here, the defender wins.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.810 align:middle line:84%
If they're right here,
it's a long fight.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you have any direct
experiences or contact with

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:90%
these?

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Sure, yeah.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I fought them in battle.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.590 align:middle line:90%
They suck.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Do you give an example
of any positive psionic species

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:90%
out there?

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.800 align:middle line:90%
And how so?

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.850 align:middle line:10%
>> CRAMER: Sure, lots.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:59.070 align:middle line:84%
So again, I would probably
go back to the bronze ones.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:03.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their main thing
is psionic development.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And to the point where, if
I am to understand correctly

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.110 align:middle line:84%
what I have been instructed
and taught by them,

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:14.280 align:middle line:84%
that they choose
to live in a body

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.850 align:middle line:84%
because they want a
physical experience.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.650 align:middle line:10%
They want to be able
to touch things.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.630 align:middle line:10%
They want to be able
to pick something up.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.670 align:middle line:84%
They want to be able
to taste something.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.460 align:middle line:84%
They want to be able
to smell something.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Your senses, as an energy
being, are not the same

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.760 align:middle line:90%
as they are as a physical being.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.059 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying you can't
psionically smell something

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:37.289 align:middle line:90%
because you can.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:40.919 align:middle line:84%
But I guarantee a psionic
smell of something

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:44.430 align:middle line:84%
is not going to be the same as
the chemical stimuli hitting

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:84%
an olfactory sensor,
communicating

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.890 align:middle line:84%
to a brain that then tells you
this is what that smell smells

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:51.690 align:middle line:90%
like.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.760 align:middle line:10%
>> EMERY: Is it like an
interpretation of that?

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.593 align:middle line:90%
Or it's artificial?

00:08:54.593 --> 00:08:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I wouldn't say it's
either one of those things.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:84%
I'd say it's more like what's
the difference between smelling

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:07.210 align:middle line:84%
something with five nerve
endings versus smelling

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.970 align:middle line:84%
something with
1,000 nerve endings.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And they would prefer to have
a physical body and smell

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:84%
something with
1,000 nerve endings

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:19.870 align:middle line:84%
than just energetically smell
it with 5, if that makes

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.620 align:middle line:90%
any sort of mathematical sense.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.380 align:middle line:90%
So they choose to be in a body.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.600 align:middle line:84%
They choose what the body's
operations specifically are.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.978 align:middle line:84%
They choose how
their organs work

00:09:30.978 --> 00:09:32.311 align:middle line:90%
and how their organs are placed.

00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:33.186 align:middle line:90%
They choose so many--

00:09:33.186 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:90%


00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Everything that
you and I take for

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:84%
granted as we were just born
that way or we just grew up

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.700 align:middle line:84%
that way or we just
evolved that way

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.572 align:middle line:90%
is a conscious choice to them.

00:09:44.572 --> 00:09:46.780 align:middle line:84%
They literally go, well,
what do I want to do A or B?

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do A. What
do I want to do this time?

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.110 align:middle line:90%
A or B?

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do B.
Instead of it being

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a
autonomic process,

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.950 align:middle line:84%
it is a thoughtful
conscious process

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.480 align:middle line:84%
that they choose to
live in a physical body

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.570 align:middle line:84%
so that they can interact
with other beings

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:02.440 align:middle line:90%
in physical bodies.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.050 align:middle line:84%
They also think that
it's better to interact

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.030 align:middle line:84%
with physical beings
in a physical body

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:10.150 align:middle line:84%
than trying to interact with
them without a physical body.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.020 align:middle line:90%
I can see the validity of that.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And so they live
their entire existence

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:20.470 align:middle line:84%
to master their own physical
body through their mind

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:84%
so that they can tell
their body to do anything

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.290 align:middle line:84%
that it needs to do,
including be anywhere or be

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:84%
any number of
versions of themselves

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.190 align:middle line:84%
that they need to be
at any given moment.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Which means if we had a
bronze one who was standing

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.140 align:middle line:90%
right here, be about yay high.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And we called him Zed
just because that's

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:42.820 align:middle line:90%
an easy one, right?

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And his ability mentally is that
he could be physically sitting

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.970 align:middle line:84%
here having a
conversation with us,

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:55.030 align:middle line:84%
but he could also be
physically present having

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.480 align:middle line:90%
a conversation with a hundred--

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.260 align:middle line:84%
he could be having 100 other
conversations with 100 versions

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.890 align:middle line:84%
of himself being physically
present at that conversation,

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:07.852 align:middle line:90%
and he's still the same person.

00:11:07.852 --> 00:11:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is there
a limit to that?

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I'm not
sure what it is.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.962 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure what his limit is.

00:11:11.962 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it's 100
or 1,000 or more than that.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.330 align:middle line:90%
But it's a large number.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.460 align:middle line:84%
A larger number than
my brain or your brain

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.410 align:middle line:84%
would be able to
try and comprehend.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How are ETs
using psionics on humanity,

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.050 align:middle line:90%
the humans here on Earth?

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Depends.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:32.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the easiest way
to negatively affect

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:37.360 align:middle line:84%
another being or species or
person without physically

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.980 align:middle line:90%
accosting them is psionic--

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Why would they
want to do that though?

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: To
determine an outcome.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Could they use that
the opposite, to help us?

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.297 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Absolutely.

00:11:49.297 --> 00:11:52.900 align:middle line:84%
If you want to get
something from someone

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.810 align:middle line:84%
or you want to help that
person do something.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And either way whether
you want to get something

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.740 align:middle line:84%
or you want to help them and
you don't want to be noticed,

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.600 align:middle line:84%
best way to do either
one of those things

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.940 align:middle line:84%
is with a psionic skill
or a psionic tool.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.640 align:middle line:84%
So that would enable you
to be able to either prod

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.460 align:middle line:84%
the individual in such a way
to get the thing that you want

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:15.390 align:middle line:84%
or to help the individual in
another way in which you are

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.870 align:middle line:84%
seen as having no hand,
no influence whatsoever

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.760 align:middle line:90%
because it was all psionic.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What species is, that
you know of, using psionics

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.790 align:middle line:90%
on us right now?

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: I mean, like just
about every species that might

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:33.752 align:middle line:90%
be in our environment.

00:12:33.752 --> 00:12:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Boy, that's a good one.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, again, like all of them.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if they're
a psionic species,

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.970 align:middle line:84%
then there is almost
certainly some amount

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:84%
of psionic influence that
they are attempting to have,

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.390 align:middle line:90%
either positive or negative.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.422 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is it on the
governments, the militaries?

00:12:49.422 --> 00:12:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Is it different than that
when they're using psionics

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.080 align:middle line:90%
on an individual, for instance?

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle line:10%
It would depend on whose
department that task, or job,

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:07.470 align:middle line:10%
is, who or what they are
tasked to help or hinder.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And then depending
on whether it's

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.330 align:middle line:84%
a single individual,
a group of people,

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.820 align:middle line:84%
a department, an agency,
a branch of the military.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Would depend on which
psionic amplifier or number

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.880 align:middle line:84%
of psionic specialists using
psionic amplifiers that

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.000 align:middle line:84%
would use to get the effect
on that number of personnel.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, if it's one person
you only need one specialist.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.970 align:middle line:84%
If you're talking about
multiple people or more agencies

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:84%
or departments, then you're
using tools, amplifiers,

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.040 align:middle line:90%
and more personnel.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: How does physical
proximity work into this?

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Is it different if you're a few
feet away from me, if you're

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.660 align:middle line:90%
a couple light years away?

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.285 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: That's a
very good question.

00:13:44.285 --> 00:13:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
in theory, on paper,

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.410 align:middle line:84%
it's not supposed to
make a difference.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.990 align:middle line:84%
But everyone I
can tell you knows

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:57.710 align:middle line:84%
that proximity and distance
does make a difference.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of those
weird things where

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.490 align:middle line:84%
in theory and on paper,
it shouldn't matter

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:05.590 align:middle line:84%
whether you were
this close to me

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.620 align:middle line:84%
or whether you were on the
other end of the planet.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Is it non-linear?

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Again, in theory and
on paper, it's supposed to be.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:19.300 align:middle line:84%
It sort of turns out to
be a Heisenberg Principle.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Where if you look at it
like it's a particle,

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:22.900 align:middle line:90%
it's a particle.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at it like
it's a wave, it's a wave.

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you think of something
as having no limitation

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:90%
by distance, then it doesn't.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:39.020 align:middle line:84%
But if you think that
it does, then it does.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And since almost every living
thing has a physical limitation

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:49.240 align:middle line:84%
that is affected by
proximity, we almost always

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.940 align:middle line:84%
project into our own
thoughts and our own minds

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.890 align:middle line:90%
that physical proximity matters.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So in the laboratory when
we do psionic studies,

00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:59.760 align:middle line:90%
we know it matters.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.260 align:middle line:84%
When we do tests in the field,
we know that it matters.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.400 align:middle line:84%
We know under certain
circumstances,

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.640 align:middle line:90%
people are able to ignore that.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And then do what is in theory
and let those proximities no

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:15.720 align:middle line:90%
longer be at play.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.700 align:middle line:90%
But in practice, they matter.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.480 align:middle line:84%
They matter because we think
that they matter and everyone

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.280 align:middle line:90%
thinks that they matter.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And you might just think,
oh, I could tell myself

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:27.780 align:middle line:90%
that that doesn't matter.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:90%
Good luck.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Because chances are if billions
and billions of other living

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.940 align:middle line:84%
things are having that
same obstacle psionically,

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.340 align:middle line:84%
so are most people going
to have that same obstacle.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.257 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Which leads
me to the next question.

00:15:40.257 --> 00:15:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Are there species
that have more power

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.400 align:middle line:84%
than humans with
psionic abilities

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:49.170 align:middle line:84%
that they could, let's say,
use that at greater distances

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.060 align:middle line:90%
compared to that of a human?

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Sure.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, what equals a
set of psionic outputs, what

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:04.720 align:middle line:84%
comes before the equal sign
is a series of variables based

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:84%
on mind, tuning or performance
of that mind, cranial capacity,

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.592 align:middle line:90%
number of quadrants.

00:16:15.592 --> 00:16:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's say quadrants
because we have four.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.590 align:middle line:90%
But the number of compartments.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:20.048 align:middle line:84%
We say quadrants
because it's four.

00:16:20.048 --> 00:16:23.530 align:middle line:84%
But there are brains that
can have as many as 12

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.850 align:middle line:90%
or 16 compartments.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:29.540 align:middle line:90%
So that can affect the equation.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.900 align:middle line:84%
The biology of the
species which affects

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:37.200 align:middle line:84%
the energy body of the species
also is part of that equation.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.960 align:middle line:90%
So there's a physics equation.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And x plus y plus z plus a plus
b plus c plus d equals outputs.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Depending on the species,
their brain power,

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:52.490 align:middle line:84%
number of compartments
that their brain has,

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:56.300 align:middle line:84%
how developed they have been
at psionics over centuries

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:02.870 align:middle line:84%
or thousands of years, plus a
certain amount of random who's

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.020 align:middle line:84%
a little stronger, who's
a little weaker today

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.010 align:middle line:90%
plays out in any interaction.

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And so any interaction
is going to have--

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:15.030 align:middle line:84%
those physics variables
have to add up before you

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.890 align:middle line:90%
get to that equal sign.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And that outputs,
what we have noticed

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.420 align:middle line:84%
is that, again, with
different species humans,

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:29.520 align:middle line:84%
especially, if you have a
series of concentric circles

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:35.000 align:middle line:84%
so that a person is showing a
output of 20 scions per second

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.980 align:middle line:84%
at 3 meters and then it goes
down to 15 scions per second

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.640 align:middle line:84%
at 2 meters and 10 scions
per second at 3 meters

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and then down to 5 or
less at 20m, that's

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.745 align:middle line:84%
showing an effect of
that person's outputs

00:17:53.745 --> 00:17:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and how they're
affected over distance.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:18:00.000 align:middle line:84%
But again, this is part of the
equation that's not constant.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So a certain set of outputs
doesn't have the same decline

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.380 align:middle line:84%
over distance that
another person's outputs

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.520 align:middle line:90%
can show decline over distance.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.280 align:middle line:84%
A decline in energy and
outputs over a distance

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.780 align:middle line:90%
in feet or meters.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:22.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's different for everybody
because all those variables

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.950 align:middle line:90%
are different.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.690 align:middle line:90%
And so there is no--

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.280 align:middle line:90%
it's complicated math.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.115 align:middle line:84%
It's some complicated
physics math

00:18:30.115 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:84%
in which you have to have
all those variables which

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.360 align:middle line:90%
equal outputs.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:38.360 align:middle line:84%
So a species can have very
intense psionic outputs

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:90%
at close range.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And may for any
number of reasons

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.070 align:middle line:84%
on how that species
develops, grows, learns,

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:51.470 align:middle line:84%
how they train themselves, may
lose tremendous psionic outputs

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:55.880 align:middle line:84%
over distance at a very
short time versus someone

00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:00.770 align:middle line:84%
who may have developed
really good lengthy outputs

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:04.190 align:middle line:90%
and less so at close inputs.

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: You're
using plural verbiage.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying that the
species could actually

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:14.270 align:middle line:84%
bundle their psionics together
for an attack or to heal?

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:16.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:21.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could say-- so
all those variables that equal

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:25.190 align:middle line:90%
outputs, we could call that O1.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And another person has another
equation that equals O2.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And then another
person could have

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.180 align:middle line:90%
an equation that equals O3.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.540 align:middle line:84%
That's their outputs one,
outputs two, outputs three.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.320 align:middle line:90%
You can combine those.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
another equation

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:84%
where O1 plus O2 plus O3 equals
O to 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.032 align:middle line:90%
parentheses to the power of X.

00:19:49.032 --> 00:19:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are there certain
protocols that need to be

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.040 align:middle line:90%
respected?

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Or can ETs just
enter anyone's mind?

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, there is a
general protocol of respect.

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Which is you don't go around
poking around in other people's

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:06.510 align:middle line:84%
brains, nor do you want
to go sending stuff

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:90%
into other people's brains.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So it would be rude for me to
go around reading other people's

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.700 align:middle line:84%
minds and it would
be rude for me

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.890 align:middle line:84%
to also be projecting thoughts
into other people's minds.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Both of those things
are considered

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.610 align:middle line:90%
rude and discourteous.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:84%
So the majority of
psionic individuals

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.040 align:middle line:84%
would respect that because
it's rude to do otherwise.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Scientists, military personnel,
spies, secret agents, whatever.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those people
go by different rules.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And so depending
on the circumstance

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.720 align:middle line:84%
will depend on whether
someone will just

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.980 align:middle line:84%
throw those rules to the wind
and either invade or read

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.610 align:middle line:84%
someone else's psionic mind
space when they it would

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.397 align:middle line:84%
be considered rude to do
so or project thoughts

00:20:50.397 --> 00:20:52.230 align:middle line:84%
into someone's mind
where it would otherwise

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:53.820 align:middle line:90%
consider be rude to do so.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.280 align:middle line:84%
If there's a military
function or purpose,

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:02.580 align:middle line:84%
well, then civil cordiality
is off the books there.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: If an extraterrestrial
would approach you using

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.970 align:middle line:84%
psionics and you do not
know how to use psionics,

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.680 align:middle line:90%
would they teach you?

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: They might.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.770 align:middle line:90%
Depends on how nice they are.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.805 align:middle line:84%
If they were nice and they're
patient, then they might.

00:21:16.805 --> 00:21:19.180 align:middle line:84%
But if they're not very nice
or they're not very patient,

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.190 align:middle line:84%
they might just not
want to take the time.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: And are they
scanning that individual to see

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.340 align:middle line:90%
if they're even capable of that?

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yeah, sure.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're looking
for that immediately.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
thing you're looking for.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:32.305 align:middle line:84%
Is this person even capable
of psionic communication?

00:21:32.305 --> 00:21:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Is there a
place in the brain where

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:38.350 align:middle line:84%
it's centralized, where these
psionic abilities develop?

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: That's a
yes and no answer,

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:45.010 align:middle line:84%
because they're sort of several
areas of the brain that are

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:48.550 align:middle line:84%
critical to psionic
growth and development.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:52.132 align:middle line:84%
And they all have to be part
of the equation for it to work.

00:21:52.132 --> 00:21:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Which
parts of the brain?

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Well, your frontal
lobe and your brain stem,

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.260 align:middle line:84%
your lower brain, and
your pineal gland.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's really the front,
the middle, and the back.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.630 align:middle line:90%
So you have three sections.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Back section, middle section,
and the front section.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do
most psionic abilities,

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.800 align:middle line:84%
it requires a balancing
act between what

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.970 align:middle line:84%
your brain is doing in
all of those three things.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:20.590 align:middle line:84%
So if your frontal lobe
is thinking too hard,

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:25.300 align:middle line:84%
you will inhibit your ability
to perform psionic skills.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:30.730 align:middle line:84%
If you are over influencing
from your brain stem

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:34.180 align:middle line:84%
or from your reptilian
brain, then you're

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.740 align:middle line:84%
over stimulating this
part of the brain.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going to get the
connection to your frontal lobe

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:40.430 align:middle line:90%
that is required.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.210 align:middle line:10%
So either one of
those over focusing

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:45.550 align:middle line:10%
is not going to get
you what you want.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Over focusing on the
pineal gland would actually

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:49.490 align:middle line:90%
can do the same thing.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:54.340 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to get you a
certain kind of information

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:58.150 align:middle line:84%
or a certain kind like trying
to open up your brain's ability

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.640 align:middle line:84%
to see outside the
visible light spectrum

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.570 align:middle line:84%
into the wider EM spectrum,
which your pineal can do.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:08.233 align:middle line:84%
But all three of those things
are required to juggle.

00:23:08.233 --> 00:23:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: So you're saying--

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.720 align:middle line:90%
you kept using the word focus.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.900 align:middle line:84%
So are you saying that thoughts
could actually mess that up?

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: Yeah,
they absolutely can.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.015 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, thinking the wrong--

00:23:18.015 --> 00:23:20.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't want to
overstate this because this

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:90%
is not exactly how it works.

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.970 align:middle line:84%
But thinking the
wrong thoughts can

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.910 align:middle line:84%
mess with what you're
trying to do psionically.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.010 align:middle line:84%
But just thinking
the right thoughts

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.570 align:middle line:84%
is not the only thing that
you need to do either.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:37.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's correct to say you want
to have focused clear thinking.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's also correct
to say that if you

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.210 align:middle line:84%
get unfocused unclear
thoughts, that that

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:44.920 align:middle line:90%
can mess with your process.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's also wrong to say
that that's the only thing that

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:49.600 align:middle line:90%
affects the outcome.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: What will it take
humans to upgrade their own

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.110 align:middle line:90%
psionic abilities?

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: A lot of calm and a
lot of groundedness and a lot

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:03.550 align:middle line:84%
of centeredness and a lot
of people not grabbing us

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.980 align:middle line:84%
by our lapels and shaking
the crap out of us.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:09.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if there's one
thing that I have learned,

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.630 align:middle line:84%
it is that you can have
random psionic acts

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and random psionic
development under conditions

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.260 align:middle line:90%
of extreme stress.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And we even train and
teach sometimes people

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.390 align:middle line:84%
how to do things
under extreme stress.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:23.458 align:middle line:90%
Bilocation, for instance.

00:24:23.458 --> 00:24:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Teleporting is
something that usually

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000 align:middle line:84%
has to happen under an extreme
stress to get someone to do it.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.790 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, to train people

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and to get them to learn
and develop the skills,

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:41.380 align:middle line:84%
you have to teach them in a
calm, clear, grounded, safe,

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:42.270 align:middle line:90%
secure environment.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:45.912 align:middle line:84%
If you open the door to
class, to psionics class,

00:24:45.912 --> 00:24:47.370 align:middle line:84%
and the first thing
you start doing

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:51.090 align:middle line:84%
is throwing stuff at people
and say, dodge the object.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:53.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're throwing
someone's ability

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.180 align:middle line:84%
to be calm and think
and meditate and focus

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.030 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that you are
hampering that person's ability

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:01.110 align:middle line:90%
to psionically develop.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we think of the entire
planet as our school room,

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:08.340 align:middle line:84%
it's too much yelling, too
much screaming, too much

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.200 align:middle line:84%
throwing stuff
around for anybody

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.140 align:middle line:90%
to really learn and develop.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So most people are
having a difficult time

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.470 align:middle line:84%
learning, growing, and
developing because there's

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.160 align:middle line:90%
just too much noise going on.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.850 align:middle line:84%
So we all need to quiet
down and calm down a bit

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:26.430 align:middle line:84%
before we really start
to develop and grow.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Are people that are
quiet and have that meditative

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:32.270 align:middle line:84%
capability, are they more
susceptible to learning

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.070 align:middle line:90%
psionics?

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Or is psionics just
downloaded into the human?

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: It's
innate in all of us.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's like if you've
got a fancy sports car.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Someone gave you a Ferrari
and said here's the keys

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and didn't tell you
how to drive it.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you'd never
driven a car before.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:90%
And so you get in.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.643 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, OK,
I'm in first gear.

00:25:54.643 --> 00:25:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And you're driving down
the road not realizing

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.200 align:middle line:84%
that there's a second
gear or a third gear

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.050 align:middle line:84%
or that it has
headlights or a radio.

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And that you're driving
in this super amazing car

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.260 align:middle line:84%
that you don't know what
half the stuff does.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.267 align:middle line:84%
And that as you learn,
oh, wait it has a radio.

00:26:11.267 --> 00:26:12.100 align:middle line:90%
Wait, I have lights.

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.570 align:middle line:84%
I can drive this
thing in the dark.

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Wait, I have gears.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:17.110 align:middle line:90%
I can go faster.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Once you start to learn
what your brain really is,

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:22.750 align:middle line:90%
which is like that sports car.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.900 align:middle line:84%
That it's not just a
Model T driving around.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:30.080 align:middle line:84%
It's got crazy fast
super cool abilities,

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.580 align:middle line:90%
but you have to learn them.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And you have to, oh,
this is what this does.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:35.865 align:middle line:90%
How do I practice this?

00:26:35.865 --> 00:26:36.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I don't know.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.530 align:middle line:84%
The first time I tried
to gearshift a car.

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:41.600 align:middle line:90%
First time, right?

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.170 align:middle line:90%
So it took a minute.

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:46.650 align:middle line:84%
So my metaphors are a
little loose sometimes.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:50.660 align:middle line:84%
But these are ways to think
about how your psionics have

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.680 align:middle line:90%
to grow and develop.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.898 align:middle line:84%
Imagine being in a vehicle
that you just didn't

00:26:53.898 --> 00:26:55.190 align:middle line:90%
know how the components worked?

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.357 align:middle line:84%
You just didn't know how
the things worked together.

00:26:57.357 --> 00:26:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And you just had to figure
stuff out by pushing buttons.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:01.730 align:middle line:90%
It might take a while.

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Or if someone came along
and sat down and go,

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.240 align:middle line:90%
oh, here's your problem.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Put your foot on the clutch.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:07.330 align:middle line:90%
Do this.

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And explained it
to you, which is

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.570 align:middle line:84%
what I feel like we do when we
teach our students psionics.

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:14.180 align:middle line:84%
We're just teaching them the
basics and the fundamentals

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.010 align:middle line:84%
that no one's ever
taught them before.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And then usually within a
pretty short period of time,

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:22.070 align:middle line:84%
they're flying along
because someone explained

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:24.360 align:middle line:90%
the basics of how it works.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And then they can
start to experience

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.520 align:middle line:90%
what that is doing the basics.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And then you do
the basics enough

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and you build up that
muscle in your arm.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And then you can do
more and more and more

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:37.000 align:middle line:90%
and more and more.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's all about starting
from it's innate in everybody.

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:46.630 align:middle line:84%
No one is either more
gifted or less gifted.

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:50.470 align:middle line:84%
What people have is
some genetic propensity

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:52.180 align:middle line:90%
that's higher than others.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.610 align:middle line:84%
But mostly what
people have is they

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:58.960 align:middle line:84%
were either raised in
environments of high acceptance

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.950 align:middle line:90%
or low acceptance.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you were raised as a
child in an environment you

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:05.890 align:middle line:90%
were told, stop imagining that.

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:07.330 align:middle line:90%
Stop talking to the cat.

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Stop talking to your
imaginary friend.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Stop doing this
and this and this,

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:14.380 align:middle line:84%
you're shutting down
that child's psionics.

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you were that
child, then your parents

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.910 align:middle line:84%
shut your psionics down
when you were a child.

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And you might have to
reopen them or have

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.130 align:middle line:84%
some other experiences
or experiences that

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.610 align:middle line:84%
might happen to you in
order to make that occur.

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:30.740 align:middle line:10%
Someone who is born in a
high acceptance environment

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.920 align:middle line:10%
simply wasn't battered down
and was given the opportunity

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.450 align:middle line:10%
to be in more acceptance.

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:42.410 align:middle line:84%
But those two people can develop
to be the same level of person

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:44.900 align:middle line:84%
or have the same level
of psionic outputs

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.220 align:middle line:90%
and psionic mastery.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Because it's only dependent, at
the point at which they start

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:55.040 align:middle line:84%
the path of development,
how long, how much time,

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.100 align:middle line:84%
how much time per day, for how
many weeks, months, or years do

00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.750 align:middle line:90%
you put into it.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.570 align:middle line:90%
That's what equals development.

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:04.850 align:middle line:90%
That's what equals skill level.

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:06.648 align:middle line:90%
That's what equals outputs.

00:29:06.648 --> 00:29:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: Compared to
extraterrestrials that have

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:12.720 align:middle line:84%
these psionic abilities, where
do humans rate on the ruler

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.520 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>> CRAMER: So that comes into
a question about development

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.580 align:middle line:90%
and potential.

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:24.845 align:middle line:90%
So development would be like--

00:29:24.845 --> 00:29:27.810 align:middle line:90%


00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:34.220 align:middle line:84%
so if we were to think of the
Terran species in a development

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:41.390 align:middle line:84%
stage, we could think of it
like a 13 or 14-year-old child.

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:42.620 align:middle line:90%
Not fully grown.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.660 align:middle line:90%
Not a five-year-old.

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.150 align:middle line:90%
But growing adolescent.

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:49.160 align:middle line:84%
We could think of
our development

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:55.670 align:middle line:84%
as a psionic species to be
about a 13 or 14-year-old.

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Say like the Draconians
for instance,

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:04.330 align:middle line:84%
their development would
be like a 75-year-old man.

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.940 align:middle line:90%
So they've had more time at it.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:10.490 align:middle line:84%
They've had longer
years, decades,

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:12.610 align:middle line:90%
centuries to develop at it.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:16.690 align:middle line:84%
But potential
wise, our potential

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.750 align:middle line:84%
is greater than their
potential, because we

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:23.170 align:middle line:84%
have a mammalian brain and
they have a reptoid brain.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And the mammalian brain has
an opportunity for development

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.397 align:middle line:84%
that the reptilian
brain does not have.

00:30:29.397 --> 00:30:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>> EMERY: Are we limitless then?

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:32.692 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yes, theoretically--

00:30:32.692 --> 00:30:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: With
psionics, of course.

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Right.

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And theoretically,
this comes down

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:39.160 align:middle line:84%
to the neurobiology
part of the brain that

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.170 align:middle line:90%
allows mammals to play.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So the same part of your
brain that allows two wolf

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.110 align:middle line:84%
cubs to jump around and
play with each other,

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:49.870 align:middle line:84%
two cats to jump around
and play with each other,

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:53.050 align:middle line:84%
or two kids to jump around
and throw balls and play

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:55.780 align:middle line:84%
with each other,
that's mammalian brain.

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.010 align:middle line:90%
Reptiles don't have that.

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And so there's something
in their creative process

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.510 align:middle line:84%
that is limited because they
don't have the play brain.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Something in our
creative process

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:11.270 align:middle line:84%
is stimulated and
fueled by the play

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:17.550 align:middle line:84%
brain that does potentially lead
to a near unlimited potential.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:20.690 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking
about development,

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:23.880 align:middle line:84%
they're a little more developed
than we are as a species.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.090 align:middle line:84%
But because our
potential is higher,

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:29.390 align:middle line:84%
right now I would say
our best psionic soldiers

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:32.940 align:middle line:84%
kick the shit out of their best
psionic soldiers right now.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.380 align:middle line:90%
They're just that much better.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:37.880 align:middle line:84%
But that's because we can
beat them on potential even

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.190 align:middle line:84%
though they have us on
development, which means

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:43.040 align:middle line:90%
we can develop beyond them.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>> EMERY: As children pray
to God with their energy

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:50.300 align:middle line:84%
and emotions, can a human do
the same thing energetically,

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.880 align:middle line:84%
psionically, to an
extraterrestrial that receives

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.000 align:middle line:90%
it?

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>> CRAMER: Yes.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:58.350 align:middle line:84%
My understanding of the
largest Galactic bureaucracy,

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:03.720 align:middle line:84%
the largest department is the
guidance counselor department.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And so the guidance
counselor department

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.880 align:middle line:84%
is where all the
guides go to work.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.930 align:middle line:84%
So any people who
have communication

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.790 align:middle line:84%
with their guides,
they're helpers.

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:16.830 align:middle line:90%
So this is what happens there.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:21.330 align:middle line:84%
If you were an intergalactic
person and you came to a place

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.460 align:middle line:84%
in your life and you're
like, I want to help out.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.750 align:middle line:90%
I really want to do more.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And someone would say, you
should go to the guidance

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:28.710 align:middle line:90%
counselor division.

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And you would go to the
guidance counselor division.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.940 align:middle line:90%
They would set you in a cubicle.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.470 align:middle line:90%
You would sit in a cubicle.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:37.170 align:middle line:84%
You would put on a
psionic amplifier halo.

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And then you would just sit
there answering questions

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:44.400 align:middle line:84%
to all the people that
might be needing guidance.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And that their internal system
would match you to that person

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:51.460 align:middle line:90%
to help guide them.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So guides are just intergalactic
guidance counselors

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:58.420 align:middle line:84%
who work in the biggest
fricking office building

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:02.350 align:middle line:84%
ever who sit at a cubicle
and answer phone calls

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.060 align:middle line:90%
from people who need help.

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:05.740 align:middle line:84%
They're intergalactic
social workers.

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:09.980 align:middle line:10%
They just sit there all day
long answering questions.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:14.200 align:middle line:84%
So if a person sends out
a random psionic message,

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.610 align:middle line:90%
help me.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:17.020 align:middle line:90%
Who's going to answer?

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Someone from the intergalactic
guidance counselor department

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.857 align:middle line:84%
who is going to
answer and say, here,

00:33:22.857 --> 00:33:24.440 align:middle line:84%
let me try and help
you out with that.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.680 align:middle line:90%
And some guidance is good.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.735 align:middle line:90%
Some of it's not so good.

00:33:27.735 --> 00:33:29.860 align:middle line:84%
So you can always say, I
don't want to talk to you.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And hang up and talk
to someone else.

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:35.150 align:middle line:84%
You can fire someone as
guidance counselor, as a guide.

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:38.560 align:middle line:90%
But it you absolutely can.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Caution should be taken
to anyone just calling out

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:44.110 align:middle line:84%
into the universe for
help because you never

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:45.770 align:middle line:90%
know who's going to answer.

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:51.400 align:middle line:84%
But if you are specific to
guidance and counseling,

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.150 align:middle line:84%
then you'll most likely just be
routed straight to the guidance

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:56.230 align:middle line:90%
counselor department.

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll be assigned
a guide or 9, or depending

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.210 align:middle line:90%
on how many you might need.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:03.550 align:middle line:84%
