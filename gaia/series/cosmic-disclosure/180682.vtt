00:00:19.532 --> 00:00:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY WEIDNER: Hi, everybody.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.820 align:middle line:90%
Jay Weidner here.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.310 align:middle line:84%
We are back today
with Jason Rice.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.330 align:middle line:10%
As I remember, you were
involved in a military action

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.510 align:middle line:10%
on a planet, and you met
these werewolf-type creatures.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.200 align:middle line:10%
What were you doing
on the planet?

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.410 align:middle line:10%
>>JASON RICE: Our unit
was there for the purpose

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.940 align:middle line:10%
of helping to train the
planetary population because we

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.240 align:middle line:10%
didn't number enough
to do all the fighting.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And part of our mandate
was that we weren't going

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.730 align:middle line:90%
to do all of the fighting.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.180 align:middle line:84%
We were there to help
get them ready to defend

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.340 align:middle line:84%
their own planet, help them
prepare as far as supplies,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:84%
help their defenses, organizing
their people into fighting

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.630 align:middle line:84%
battalions or units so
that they could put up

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.310 align:middle line:84%
a defense for the false flag
invasions that they were under.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Who was behind
the false flag invasion?

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The Draco,
the AI, the Archons.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.080 align:middle line:84%
They ultimately were the
ones calling the shots

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.690 align:middle line:84%
on these invasions,
these false flags.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And the Dracos,
the Archons, and AI,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.210 align:middle line:84%
are they three separate
groups or entities

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.000 align:middle line:90%
working together, or what?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It's my
belief that the AI

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.620 align:middle line:84%
calls the shots for the
Archons as well as the Draco.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Who made this
AI, do you know?

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: I have no idea.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
It was probably
something that was

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.502 align:middle line:84%
part of the balance, part of the
balance on a universal scale.

00:01:56.502 --> 00:02:00.250 align:middle line:84%
In order for light
to prevail, it

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:84%
needs to have a challenge,
the challenge being the AI.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I want to get back
to this battle for a second,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.220 align:middle line:84%
but first, I want to talk about
this planet that you were on.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a name
for this planet?

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I've been referring
to it as Planet One,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.180 align:middle line:84%
because I have not recalled
the name of that planet yet.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:27.286 align:middle line:84%
And most of the references
that we used were numbers.

00:02:27.286 --> 00:02:28.609 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Typical military.

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Typical military.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.685 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Don't want you
to know until it's

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:32.560 align:middle line:90%
time for you to know.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's right.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't have a
need to know the name.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Is there any significance
to the military or anybody

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.500 align:middle line:90%
to naming the planet Planet One?

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: I refer to
it as Planet One

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:84%
because of my own experiences
on this planet being

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.510 align:middle line:84%
the first exoplanet that
I had been deployed to,

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:90%
aside from the moon and Mars.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you were
on this planet.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:84%
How did you get involved
with this battle?

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: We were in
particular city that

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.740 align:middle line:84%
was right on one of the
larger lakes, the lake

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:84%
being about the size
of the Gulf of Mexico.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:13.120 align:middle line:84%
This particular planet was about
2% larger than Earth, however,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.920 align:middle line:84%
the difference
being in that it was

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.330 align:middle line:84%
that there were 60% of the
planet constituted landmass.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So the other 40% was water,
and there was no salt water.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.640 align:middle line:90%
It was all fresh.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.290 align:middle line:90%
And so they had two moons.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.670 align:middle line:84%
One of them, we called The
Potato, because of its shape

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.060 align:middle line:90%
and it was a pale yellow.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.860 align:middle line:84%
The other one we
called Nike because

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:84%
of how quickly it moved,
and it was like a light red.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.810 align:middle line:84%
We were stationed
within a city, Area 26,

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.810 align:middle line:84%
to gather intelligence,
to get information

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.310 align:middle line:84%
on the local population
because what we had to do

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:90%
was we had to train them.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And so the information we
needed was, OK, well, how

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.500 align:middle line:90%
is their civilization set up?

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:84%
What kind of structures do
they have for government?

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.940 align:middle line:84%
What kind of trading
do they have?

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.510 align:middle line:84%
What kind of manufacturing
do they have?

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:84%
What are the possibilities
for city defense?

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.515 align:middle line:84%
What kind of resources
do they have available?

00:04:17.515 --> 00:04:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And that was when we had the
kinetic energy weapon attack.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.940 align:middle line:84%
We'd been told as
part of our training

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.580 align:middle line:84%
that one of their
typical MOs was

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.670 align:middle line:84%
to bombard the poles
to raise the water

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.770 align:middle line:84%
levels throughout the
planet and try and flood out

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.910 align:middle line:90%
the coastal areas.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did they do
that, flood the planet?

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Of course they did.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they did.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: A lot of
people died there.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: A lot of people died.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Most people
live on the coast.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: My estimates are
that about half the planetary

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.350 align:middle line:84%
population died from the
war over a 40-year period.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: When we got
there, it was started out

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.810 align:middle line:90%
at about 2 billion.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And so about a billion
lives lost during that war.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So then these werewolf
creatures, when do they arrive?

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Were they, like, the leading
army for this invasion?

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were the
army for this invasion.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.310 align:middle line:84%
The civilization
on Planet One was

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.170 align:middle line:84%
about where we were during
the Industrial Revolution.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.310 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
widespread wars,

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and so they did not have
a military, or a defense

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:90%
contracting, or defensive base.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.690 align:middle line:84%
This was all pre-large
industrialized society.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And so part of our job was
there to help them prepare,

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.690 align:middle line:84%
and adapting their
existing technologies

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.220 align:middle line:90%
to creating weapons.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.980 align:middle line:84%
There was one area on
that particular planet

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:84%
that had weapons, although
they weren't at active war.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And so that one area was what
we used for the manufacture

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.950 align:middle line:84%
of their local weapons because
our policies were that we

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.520 align:middle line:84%
weren't going to introduce
advanced technologies,

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.700 align:middle line:84%
and the reasons being, at
least what they told us--

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.810 align:middle line:84%
and I have my own
thoughts on why--

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.770 align:middle line:84%
but what they told
us was that they

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.420 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to upset the
existing civilization too

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.620 align:middle line:84%
much with too many
advanced technologies.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And so what we did
was we helped them

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.170 align:middle line:84%
with their existing
technologies,

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.310 align:middle line:84%
which also meant that it limited
how much advanced technologies

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.400 align:middle line:90%
we were allowed to use.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And I know now that part of that
was the deliberate hand tying

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:84%
of those in control so that
the planetary populations would

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.350 align:middle line:84%
be deliberately reduced and
the leadership of the planet

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.750 align:middle line:84%
would be receptive to
the control measures that

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.190 align:middle line:90%
were eventually put in place.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you're
saying that whoever

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.950 align:middle line:84%
sent you in knew
deliberately, did not

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.630 align:middle line:84%
provide the necessary
defense weapons for them

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.520 align:middle line:84%
to successfully
defend themselves

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.450 align:middle line:84%
against these terrible
creatures that were coming,

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.700 align:middle line:84%
and they did it on
purpose to reduce

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.210 align:middle line:84%
the population, all the time
making it out that you guys are

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.110 align:middle line:90%
the good guys?

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That's correct.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:84%
They knew the end game was
going to be a large planetary

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.550 align:middle line:90%
reduction in population.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Their plans were
that they were going

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.710 align:middle line:84%
to reduce it enough until
the leadership of the planet

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:31.570 align:middle line:84%
was open to the financial
controls, the controlling

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.960 align:middle line:84%
governments, the controls
that they wanted to instill

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.300 align:middle line:84%
in place so that
they could eventually

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.190 align:middle line:90%
have control of the planet.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Power move.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Power move.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I think we can
basically say that you were

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.030 align:middle line:90%
foot soldiers for the Cabal.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And so the Cabal is
doing something on this planet.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.110 align:middle line:84%
What is the ultimate goal
for the Cabal on this planet?

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, if you'll
recall, the agreement

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:05.620 align:middle line:84%
that the Cabal had
with the Mars Germans

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:84%
was that they would provide
24,000 soldiers to the Mars

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:15.026 align:middle line:84%
Germans who had an
agreement with the Draco

00:08:15.026 --> 00:08:18.226 align:middle line:84%
to get out of their
moon base lease

00:08:18.226 --> 00:08:23.760 align:middle line:84%
that they would provide 12
of their carrier fleet units

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.360 align:middle line:84%
and tens of
thousands of soldiers

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.012 align:middle line:84%
to be used on what they
referred to as border control.

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:84%
For the Draco, this meant
expanding their borders.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And so using these foot
soldiers on these planets

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:48.350 align:middle line:84%
to establish a much faster
means for planetary control.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.860 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to have
to wait 2,000 years.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.990 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
to have to delay

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:84%
for the planetary populations to
work through their technology,

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.460 align:middle line:84%
to work on their
social structures,

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.040 align:middle line:84%
to come up with
planetary governments,

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.510 align:middle line:84%
and the hundreds,
if not thousands,

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.559 align:middle line:84%
of years in which a normal
civilization progresses,

00:09:10.559 --> 00:09:11.600 align:middle line:90%
they didn't want to wait.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.400 align:middle line:90%


00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.870 align:middle line:84%
So this was a quick
way of doing it.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.680 align:middle line:84%
They introduce a
false flag invasion.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.730 align:middle line:90%
We show up.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.170 align:middle line:90%
Hey, we're here to help.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.750 align:middle line:84%
We'll help you
defend your planet.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:25.310 align:middle line:84%
The cost of doing
that was they turn

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:90%
over control of their planet.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: You mentioned that
the enemy were the Dracos.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And so who were
these werewolves?

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: These werewolves
were creations by the Draco

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:47.770 align:middle line:84%
as their proxy to do whatever
they needed them to do.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the Draco line of
thinking is, why in the world

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.080 align:middle line:84%
would they put
themselves at risk when

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.560 align:middle line:84%
they have their proxies that
are more than willing to do it,

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:84%
which included us as
well as their creations,

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.460 align:middle line:90%
these werewolves?

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And we already
have programs and DARPA.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And the Russians
are also working

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.220 align:middle line:84%
on creating artificial
soldiers right now.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.514 align:middle line:90%
So it's already--

00:10:12.514 --> 00:10:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: --already occurring.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.532 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:10:14.532 --> 00:10:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: All right.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.130 align:middle line:84%
So now you are, what,
headed to your first battle?

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.750 align:middle line:84%
You must have heard reports of
these creatures slaughtering

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle line:90%
people?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why don't you
describe them again?

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The briefings that
we received were incomplete,

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.550 align:middle line:84%
and they were deliberately
incomplete because they wanted

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.220 align:middle line:90%
us to, again, lose people.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Part of their tactics was
to have a large percentage

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:90%
of the population lost.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So the briefings
that we received

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:48.710 align:middle line:90%
were filled with gaps, holes.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:52.410 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have information
on what or whom

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.350 align:middle line:84%
or the technology
levels of what we

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.260 align:middle line:84%
would be facing other
than that we were going

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.800 align:middle line:90%
to have an invasion force.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.430 align:middle line:84%
So we were out
doing a patrol, just

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.720 align:middle line:84%
like we had done any
number of days before,

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:84%
probing the area to see if we
ended up having a reaction,

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.820 align:middle line:90%
and came in contact.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Me and eight others from my
unit were embedded in a native--

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.860 align:middle line:84%
we called them the
Indigs is what we

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.190 align:middle line:90%
refer to them as-- indigenous.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.510 align:middle line:84%
We were embedded in
a platoon-sized unit

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.880 align:middle line:84%
of about 40 people, and were
doing a platoon movement.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.610 align:middle line:84%
I was on the outskirts
of a larger city.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Now you have to
understand these cities

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
that we were operating in did
not have any large skyscrapers.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:84%
The way that this
civilization operated

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.300 align:middle line:84%
was that, when they needed
more space, they spread out.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And the way that their
civilization was based

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:84%
was it was-- you know,
initially was based on trade

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and did not have a
financial system.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.980 align:middle line:84%
They did not have
any fiat currency.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.640 align:middle line:90%
That was later introduced.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: By you?

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.390 align:middle line:90%
By you guys, right?

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: By the commanding
staff as part of one

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.470 align:middle line:90%
of the requirements for--

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.385 align:middle line:90%
That was part of the control.

00:12:14.385 --> 00:12:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And so they had a really
stable civilization

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:25.300 align:middle line:84%
before we showed up to help
them with this invasion.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.040 align:middle line:84%
First contact-- we
were out on a patrol.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.370 align:middle line:84%
My unit was embedded in
this platoon-sized element,

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.840 align:middle line:84%
and we were on the
outskirts of a larger city.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And the first
indication something

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:43.290 align:middle line:84%
was going wrong was the
enemy had opened, I believe,

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:48.390 align:middle line:84%
prematurely because we were
crossing a large avenue of one

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.630 align:middle line:90%
of their roads.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And about a third
of the platoon was

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.280 align:middle line:84%
exposed on the road
when they opened up.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And if they'd waited until
we were all in the open,

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.060 align:middle line:84%
they would have had
much better results.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.800 align:middle line:90%
But thankfully, they didn't.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Next to the road was this
18-inch deep little ditch.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.660 align:middle line:84%
It felt like a scratched
out piece of the Earth.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Didn't feel like it
was 18 inches deep.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.820 align:middle line:84%
So most of us were able
to take cover there.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Behind us was a building about
30 by 15 by three stories.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:29.700 align:middle line:84%
It was a smaller commercial
building, stone block.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And so to our front were
off in the distance more

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.410 align:middle line:90%
like huts, residential huts.

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And those were too far to make
it too and not really providing

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.758 align:middle line:84%
much in the way of cover,
even if we'd wanted to.

00:13:44.758 --> 00:13:50.220 align:middle line:84%
So the SOP was to fall back
to a structure that would

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.580 align:middle line:90%
have provided us with cover.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And this being
the first contact,

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.280 align:middle line:84%
we wanted to fall back into
that commercial building.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So we moved into it
and returned fire,

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.930 align:middle line:84%
covering the bounding groups
that worked their way back

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:05.760 align:middle line:90%
into the building.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.567 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Were they just
firing from a ship?

00:14:07.567 --> 00:14:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They were firing
from the other side

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.800 align:middle line:90%
of the road in a forested area.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And so at first, we
couldn't see them,

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:90%
and it was just mostly shadows.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And we couldn't
tell who and what.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: But you must
have had intel that--

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.910 align:middle line:84%
telling you what they looked
like previously, right?

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:26.865 align:middle line:90%
This is part of the gap.

00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: This is the very
first encounter then?

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The very
first encounter.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And my suspicion is that they
had very detailed information

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:38.220 align:middle line:84%
on what they looked like,
but we didn't get it.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.320 align:middle line:84%
They kept it from
us, again, in order

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.900 align:middle line:90%
to keep the casualty numbers up.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So then they were
firing from the woods?

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.900 align:middle line:84%
What kind of weapons
were they firing?

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Found out later that
they were a cryogenic type

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:52.630 align:middle line:90%
weapon and--

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Cryogenic.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Cryogenic.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: So freezing cold, what?

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: It used in a
cryogenic substance.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And given the level of
our current technology

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:08.590 align:middle line:84%
that we have here,
I don't want to get

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:13.030 align:middle line:84%
into how they work because
some of it could be duplicated,

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:17.044 align:middle line:84%
and that's not the purpose
of what I'm coming forward.

00:15:17.044 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing
I want to do is

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.900 align:middle line:84%
provide another
weapon for people

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.335 align:middle line:90%
to hurt other people with.

00:15:21.335 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Fair enough.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: But they were
cryogenically operated.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.360 align:middle line:84%
They were a bladed,
projectile type.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So it had built into
it a large blade.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And aside from
that, these beings

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:41.370 align:middle line:84%
had large claws on their
feet as well as their hands.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.570 align:middle line:90%
They were bipedal.

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:46.690 align:middle line:84%
They were about eight
to nine feet tall.

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.990 align:middle line:84%
They were a cross
between a machine

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.840 align:middle line:90%
and biological material.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:16:00.180 align:middle line:84%
You could see tubes or hoses
or mechanical type joints

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.950 align:middle line:90%
in between their armor.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.760 align:middle line:90%
They had black skin.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.570 align:middle line:84%
They had tufts of gray or
dark gray or black fur.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.790 align:middle line:84%
They had a shortened
snout full of teeth

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.720 align:middle line:90%
that they used to great effect.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.760 align:middle line:84%
But our first exposure to
them was after we'd all

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.430 align:middle line:90%
made it into the building.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Myself and the platoon
leader went up to the roof,

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:30.540 align:middle line:84%
and we were returning
fire across the road.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And when I got to the roof,
I started hearing people

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:36.950 align:middle line:90%
screaming, oh my god.

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.490 align:middle line:90%
What the heck is that?

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
were a lot more colorful

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.890 align:middle line:84%
about their descriptions
because, you know,

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.750 align:middle line:84%
we'd never seen
these things before.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And they moved at a really--
what would be for a human--

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.600 align:middle line:90%
a really fast walk.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.110 align:middle line:84%
But that was the
extent of their pace,

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.380 align:middle line:90%
and they always moved that fast.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.110 align:middle line:84%
However, they were
capable of jumping

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.900 align:middle line:84%
incredible distances,
which we found out

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.881 align:middle line:90%
very shortly on that first day.

00:17:04.881 --> 00:17:06.589 align:middle line:84%
When they reached the
side of a building,

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:09.619 align:middle line:84%
they never tried getting
into the first floor where

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:12.762 align:middle line:90%
we had people firing at them.

00:17:12.762 --> 00:17:17.210 align:middle line:84%
They jumped from the ground up
to the top of the third floor

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:20.432 align:middle line:90%
and attacked us up on the roof.

00:17:20.432 --> 00:17:22.196 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Wow.

00:17:22.196 --> 00:17:25.010 align:middle line:84%
So they weren't real
fast, but they could leap.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: They could leap.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And we found out also, once
they got within melee range,

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.410 align:middle line:84%
they dropped their
weapons because it

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:35.390 align:middle line:90%
was harnessed to them.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And so then they would
use their claws or teeth.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And at first I
thought, OK, gosh.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.790 align:middle line:84%
These guys are
really, really dumb.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:84%
But then after thinking about it
and realizing later that these

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.520 align:middle line:90%
were created beings--

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and as part of the AI's attempt
to create as many trigger

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.360 align:middle line:90%
pullers as possible--

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.684 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have to program
them with high intelligence

00:18:03.684 --> 00:18:04.850 align:middle line:90%
because they didn't need it.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:08.150 align:middle line:84%
They just needed beings that
were going to be pulling

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:09.170 align:middle line:90%
triggers.

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And so part of the
problem was that in order

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.680 align:middle line:84%
to have a high
tactical ability, you

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.620 align:middle line:84%
have to determine
what targets to shoot

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:22.586 align:middle line:84%
at when you're at close range,
so you don't hit your own.

00:18:22.586 --> 00:18:26.240 align:middle line:84%
They eliminated that
aspect altogether.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So they dropped their
weapons and went

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:32.582 align:middle line:90%
to claws and teeth or blades.

00:18:32.582 --> 00:18:35.320 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't have to
worry about the tactics of,

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, if I shoot at this enemy
and my person or my team

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.810 align:middle line:84%
is close by, I
have to watch out.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:44.130 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have to worry
about those algorithms.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.671 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: They just
dropped their weapon

00:18:45.671 --> 00:18:48.202 align:middle line:84%
and started ripping
everything up.

00:18:48.202 --> 00:18:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
psychologically that

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.160 align:middle line:90%
has to be--

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Terrible.

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Terribly scary.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Because you've
got this nine foot

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.550 align:middle line:90%
beast coming at you trying to--

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:00.440 align:middle line:84%
what we thought at
first-- was eat you.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
later we realized

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.470 align:middle line:90%
that, no, it wasn't to eat us.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:08.400 align:middle line:90%
It was just to eliminate us.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: They didn't take
prisoners or anything?

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: No.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Did you take prisoners?

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: We tried.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Another part of
their programming

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.880 align:middle line:84%
was that they would
fight to the very last,

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and it was just another
proof of how alien they were.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.370 align:middle line:90%
There was no surrender.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.260 align:middle line:90%
We had no POWs.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, part of the cleanup
process at the end of the war

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:34.060 align:middle line:84%
generally would involve
taking care of the POWs.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And there weren't any because
they would not surrender,

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and they would fight with
every last bit of energy

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:43.980 align:middle line:90%
that they had.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.850 align:middle line:84%
That was part of
their programming.

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:48.280 align:middle line:90%
It was very scary--

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.980 align:middle line:90%
terrifying at first.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, some of the
exclamations when they--

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.960 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't at the wall,
the parapet wall on the roof

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.350 align:middle line:84%
when they first emerged
from the treeline

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:01.150 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of the road.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.940 align:middle line:84%
But I understood very
quickly when I got there

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:08.050 align:middle line:84%
why there were so many people
scared going, what in the world

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:09.340 align:middle line:90%
are we fighting?

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: How many of
them were there?

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:15.295 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: In that first
wave, there were about 50.

00:20:15.295 --> 00:20:16.479 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And how many of you?

00:20:16.479 --> 00:20:17.770 align:middle line:90%
There weren't very many of you.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: 40 of us.

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And we found out really
quickly that the .38

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.370 align:middle line:84%
sized automatic weapons
that we were using

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:27.310 align:middle line:84%
were pretty ineffective
in taking them down.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.350 align:middle line:84%
The secondary
weapons that we had

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:84%
were about a .50 caliber,
except they were a single shot.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.630 align:middle line:84%
It was a semiautomatic, but
it wasn't fully automatic.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:40.200 align:middle line:84%
The magazine carried
about five rounds.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Problem was that we only had
about 15 rounds per person.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And so the first wave of
about 50 came through,

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:53.140 align:middle line:84%
and we defended our position
after that first wave

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.860 align:middle line:84%
and quickly caught on that
our standard weapons weren't

00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:58.660 align:middle line:90%
effective.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And people started
using their secondaries.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And after you start shooting
at something and nothing's

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.230 align:middle line:84%
happening, you've
got to go to plan B.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And so the second wave
was about the same size.

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:18.100 align:middle line:84%
We found out that there was one
commander for about every 15

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.520 align:middle line:90%
to 20 soldiers, foot soldiers.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And they were the only ones
that took their eyes off of us.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.290 align:middle line:84%
The foot soldiers--
the trigger pullers--

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:30.910 align:middle line:90%
never took their eyes off of us.

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:33.574 align:middle line:84%
They were there were like
a fire-and-forget weapon,

00:21:33.574 --> 00:21:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly
what they were.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:36.730 align:middle line:84%
There was large
numbers of them that

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.720 align:middle line:84%
would just come until
they either wiped us

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.530 align:middle line:90%
out or were wiped out.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: All right.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:47.020 align:middle line:84%
So you're outgunned,
you're outnumbered,

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and they're bigger
and stronger than you.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.249 align:middle line:90%
How did you win?

00:21:50.249 --> 00:21:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: That's a
great question, Jay.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And we weren't
necessarily outgunned

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:57.160 align:middle line:84%
because eventually
we would have had

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.990 align:middle line:84%
to have used our
advanced technology,

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.670 align:middle line:90%
or we would have lost.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So at , first they wouldn't
allow us to use the advanced

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:06.700 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And when they did,
it was very limited.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.260 align:middle line:90%
Now how did we win?

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:17.460 align:middle line:84%
They were programmed
from the beginning

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:24.955 align:middle line:84%
have deficiencies because
they weren't intended to win.

00:22:24.955 --> 00:22:29.210 align:middle line:84%
These false flag invaders
were intended to lose.

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:90%
They'd planned on them losing.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Because the Draco looked at
planetary conquering as they

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.220 align:middle line:84%
had to have the
populations there

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.150 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted somebody
to control to begin with.

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:47.555 align:middle line:84%
And the planetary population
had to ask and invite them.

00:22:47.555 --> 00:22:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And so they didn't
want to wipe them out.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Because what would be the
purpose of wiping out somebody

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.910 align:middle line:90%
that you're wanting to conquer?

00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And so sending in these
false flag invaders--

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.790 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning, they
planned on them losing.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:09.260 align:middle line:84%
The process of going through
planetary population reduction

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:12.380 align:middle line:84%
was what they'd intended on
happening from the beginning.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So the
Cabal and the Draco

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.350 align:middle line:90%
are actually working together.

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And creating a
theatrical operation

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:23.870 align:middle line:84%
designed to advance the
planet quickly into the realms

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.340 align:middle line:90%
that the Cabal wants.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.147 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:23:26.147 --> 00:23:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I guess you must
have figured out how

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.070 align:middle line:90%
to take them out eventually.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Eventually.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.960 align:middle line:84%
What we first were trained
to do was center mass.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.580 align:middle line:90%
Shoot the center mass.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, you try
and make a head shot.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.059 align:middle line:90%
It's moving around too quickly.

00:23:41.059 --> 00:23:42.350 align:middle line:90%
It's really, really hard to do.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.510 align:middle line:90%
So you aim for center mass.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And with what they called
the charge stopper--

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.510 align:middle line:84%
because, again, it
was a local weapon,

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:53.660 align:middle line:84%
and it was about the
equivalent to a .50 cal

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.910 align:middle line:84%
and about the size of
a sawed off shotgun.

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And they used them
for to stop charges.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:04.615 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

00:24:04.615 --> 00:24:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Up close it
would be very effective.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:07.790 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yeah.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.000 align:middle line:90%
Very effective up close.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.880 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't get much
of distance on it.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.330 align:middle line:84%
But it meant that you got it
within arm's reach of this nine

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:84%
foot werewolf that was using
teeth, claws, and everything

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.260 align:middle line:84%
else at its disposal
to try and kill you.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: When it came down
hand-to-hand combat,

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:27.260 align:middle line:84%
did they use tactics like
animals here on Earth

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.280 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of thing?

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Yes.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.250 align:middle line:84%
They would try
and grab your arms

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.760 align:middle line:90%
and jump up with their feet.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: And use their weight?

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Use their weight.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:40.040 align:middle line:90%
Dig their claws in.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we didn't know
any of this at first.

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And as, you know,
trial by fire, you

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.270 align:middle line:90%
learn the lessons the hard way.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
we figured it out.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.260 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of things that
we figured out the hard way

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.850 align:middle line:84%
that they could have told
us about, but they didn't.

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Part of our
camouflage and systems

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:06.310 align:middle line:84%
were ineffective above
two or three people

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.280 align:middle line:84%
because the electronic
signatures were picked up.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.640 align:middle line:90%
We found that out the hard way.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:15.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my unit
went about setting up

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:18.970 align:middle line:84%
some tests where we had
the holographic camouflage

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.190 align:middle line:90%
systems that we used--

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:25.020 align:middle line:84%
we kept wondering how in the
world were they localizing us?

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:29.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're effectively
camouflaged, supposedly,

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.700 align:middle line:84%
from infrared and signals
as well as visual.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And we're going to
get in a later episode.

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Sure.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: The whole camouflage
suit and everything.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.440 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So this battle is going,
and you guys at first

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.490 align:middle line:84%
are losing because
you're so surprised

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:47.920 align:middle line:90%
by the ferocity of your enemy.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And then, what, you
eventually figured out

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:53.380 align:middle line:84%
that using the .50 cal up
close was your only hope.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Yep, which is
basically a 12 gauge slug shot.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.610 align:middle line:90%
And that was what was working.

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And so once we
realized that, the word

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.100 align:middle line:84%
went out to the
rest of the platoon.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.640 align:middle line:84%
We'd already lost about
eight people at that point.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And so with the second wave,
we were able to take them down

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:18.460 align:middle line:90%
with those secondary weapons.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:21.760 align:middle line:84%
The third wave was, I
figured, about a hundred

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.590 align:middle line:90%
of them that came at one time.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:26.130 align:middle line:84%
They didn't waste
much time in between.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And so that was the scariest
part of it because most of us

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:34.945 align:middle line:84%
were out of weapons,
out of ammo.

00:26:34.945 --> 00:26:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I ran out of ammo and ended
up going hand-to-hand.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And I don't recall much of
the latter part of the combat

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:46.090 align:middle line:84%
because it just
happened so quickly.

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:48.550 align:middle line:84%
I remember seeing
people fall down

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.150 align:middle line:90%
less than 10 feet away from me.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:50.950 align:middle line:90%
I was injured.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:53.020 align:middle line:84%
I had multiple injuries,
and I can't tell you

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.385 align:middle line:90%
when or how it happened.

00:26:54.385 --> 00:26:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: And did you have like
other weapons around you

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.945 align:middle line:90%
to assist you with hand-to-hand?

00:26:58.945 --> 00:27:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: We had
our combat knives.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Yeah.

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:01.360 align:middle line:90%
That's all you had?

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: That was it.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.770 align:middle line:84%
We had fixed
bayonets, so we were

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:11.100 align:middle line:84%
able to use our rifles
as a spear, if you will,

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.880 align:middle line:90%
to only so much effect.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.000 align:middle line:84%
But working in teams
was the best defenses

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.590 align:middle line:84%
that we could come up
with because, you know,

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:20.320 align:middle line:90%
one-on-one we were no match.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.651 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: I was going to say,
just the reach alone--

00:27:22.651 --> 00:27:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: The reach alone.

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: --would be--

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: The eight
of us, nine of us,

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:28.210 align:middle line:84%
including myself,
that were there

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:33.400 align:middle line:84%
that had the nanite enhancements
stood a much better chance

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:37.360 align:middle line:84%
of defending ourselves alone
than the other soldiers that

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.765 align:middle line:84%
didn't have those
nanite enhancements.

00:27:40.765 --> 00:27:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So you eventually
defeated them,

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.930 align:middle line:84%
and you had to kill them
down to the last creature.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Down to
the last creature.

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:51.690 align:middle line:84%
There were multiple times
throughout that four years

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.920 align:middle line:84%
where clean up or follow
on troops or reinforcements

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.670 align:middle line:84%
would show up, and
everybody'd be gone.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:03.050 align:middle line:90%
Everybody, down to the last man.

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:05.661 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
out of ammunition.

00:28:05.661 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And once they got down to the
last very few people, that

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:12.146 align:middle line:84%
was one of their tactics is
that they would wear you down

00:28:12.146 --> 00:28:13.520 align:middle line:84%
until you were
out of ammunition,

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and then you were
at hand-to-hand.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.592 align:middle line:84%
And in a hand-to-hand,
they had the advantage.

00:28:18.592 --> 00:28:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: Did they later
rectify the situation

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:23.540 align:middle line:84%
by allowing you to have
more ammunition when

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:24.840 align:middle line:90%
you went on rounds?

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: They increased
our standard load.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.780 align:middle line:90%
They increased it from 15 to 30.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.130 align:middle line:84%
But there are still
limits on how much

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:35.600 align:middle line:90%
the soldiers could carry.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Having the nanite enhancements
allowed us to carry a lot more.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:44.290 align:middle line:84%
If they'd allowed us to
use our combat armor suits,

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:46.330 align:middle line:84%
things would have
gone very different.

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So when you guys
got back to headquarters,

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.900 align:middle line:90%
were you all POed?

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: We were very
upset because where's

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:56.330 align:middle line:90%
the intelligence?

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Where's the information
on who we're facing

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.920 align:middle line:90%
and what we're facing?

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.030 align:middle line:90%
And we were told suck it up.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: In a way, they were
developing you, though,

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:12.890 align:middle line:84%
by forcing you into areas where
you had to be super tough.

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd pick out the
tough guys and the tougher

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.630 align:middle line:84%
guys, and then they could
lead other platoons, right?

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>RICE: Combat Darwinism.

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:20.975 align:middle line:90%
>>JAY: Combat Darwinism.

00:29:20.975 --> 00:29:22.540 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty funny.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, Jason, it's been really
good having you on our show

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:25.855 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:29:25.855 --> 00:29:27.900 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate all
the great information

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:28.700 align:middle line:90%
you're giving us.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.520 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
back to your adventures

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:34.750 align:middle line:84%
on this planet and this
war in our next episode.

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.249 align:middle line:84%
I just want to
thank you for having

00:29:36.249 --> 00:29:37.290 align:middle line:90%
the guts to come forward.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RICE: Well, thank
you for having me.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And you know, one of the
things I wanted to close out

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:45.880 align:middle line:84%
with is it truly is a blessing
to be able to help bring

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.660 align:middle line:84%
about, in whatever
way, disclosure,

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.180 align:middle line:90%
which is what we're here for.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.256 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.
